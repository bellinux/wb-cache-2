5|$|Jinnah {{rejected}} Gandhi's {{proposal and}} called for <b>Direct</b> <b>Action</b> Day, on 16 August 1946, to press Muslims to publicly gather in cities and support his proposal for partition of Indian subcontinent into a Muslim state and non-Muslim state. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal – now Bangladesh and West Bengal, gave Calcutta's police special holiday to celebrate the <b>Direct</b> <b>Action</b> Day. The <b>Direct</b> <b>Action</b> Day triggered a mass murder of Calcutta Hindus and the torching of their property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict. The British government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence. The violence on <b>Direct</b> <b>Action</b> Day led to retaliatory violence against Muslims across India. Thousands of Hindus and Muslims were murdered, {{and tens of thousands}} were injured in the cycle of violence in the days that followed. Gandhi visited the most riot-prone areas to appeal a stop to the massacres.|$|E

40|$|Mirror neurons {{are single}} cells found in macaque premotor and parietal cortices that are active during action {{execution}} and observation. In non-human primates, mirror neurons {{have only been}} found in relation to object-directed movements or communicative gestures, as non-object <b>directed</b> <b>actions</b> of the upper limb are not well characterized in non-human primates. Mirror neurons provide important evidence for motor simulation theories of cognition, {{sometimes referred to as}} the direct matching hypothesis, which propose that observed actions are mapped onto associated motor schemata in a direct and automatic manner. This study, for the first time, directly compares mirror responses, defined as the overlap between action execution and observation, during object directed and meaningless non-object <b>directed</b> <b>actions.</b> We present functional MRI data that demonstrate a clear dissociation between object directed and non-object <b>directed</b> <b>actions</b> within the human mirror system. A premotor and parietal network was preferentially active during object <b>directed</b> <b>actions,</b> whether observed or executed. Moreover, we report spatially correlated activity across multiple voxels for observation and execution of an object <b>directed</b> <b>action.</b> In contrast to predictions made by motor simulation theory, no similar activity was observed for non-object <b>directed</b> <b>actions.</b> These data demonstrate that object directed and meaningless non-object <b>directed</b> <b>actions</b> are subserved by different neuronal networks and that the human mirror response is significantly greater for object <b>directed</b> <b>actions.</b> These data have important implications for understanding the human mirror system and fo...|$|R

5|$|Crass were an English art {{collective}} and punk rock band formed in 1977 who promoted anarchism {{as a political}} ideology, {{a way of life}} and a resistance movement.

The band used and advocated a DIY punk ethic approach to its sound collages, leaflets, albums and films.|$|E
5|$|Hadley has {{conducted}} research on animal rights extremism, {{concluding that the}} phenomenon is a complex one, and that {{a full understanding of}} individual extremists' intentions and targets are necessary to understand the ethical acceptability of extremist acts and whether such acts are appropriately classified as terrorism. He holds that while <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> should be tolerated in liberal democracies, this toleration should not extend to certain campaigning tactics used by extremists, such as threat-making.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{aggressive}} tactics of Haywood and the IWW, {{along with their}} call for abolition of the wage system and the overthrow of capitalism created tension with moderate electorally-oriented leaders of the Socialist Party. Haywood and the IWW focused on <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> and strikes, which often led to violence, and were less concerned with political tactics. When Haywood was quoted speaking at public meetings in New York City {{to the effect that}} he had never advocated the use of the ballot by the workers but had instead favored the tactics of <b>direct</b> <b>action,</b> an initiative recalling Haywood from the NEC was launched by the State Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of New York. In February 1913 the recall of Haywood was approved by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Following his defeat, Haywood left the ranks of the Socialist Party, joined by thousands of other IWW members and their sympathizers.|$|E

5|$|In April 1858, Tubman was {{introduced}} to the abolitionist John Brown, an insurgent who advocated the use of violence to destroy slavery in the United States. Although she never advocated violence against whites, she agreed with his course of <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> and supported his goals. Like Tubman, he spoke of being called by God, and trusted the divine to protect him from the wrath of slaveholders. She, meanwhile, claimed to have had a prophetic vision of meeting Brown before their encounter.|$|E

5|$|Political {{activism}} in American gay communities was {{transformed by the}} arrival of AIDS in the early 1980s. When gay men tried in several desperate measures to follow established political channels to bring attention to a disease that afflicted the most cast out members of society only to meet silence from the government, some used <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> tactics. AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), formed by Larry Kramer and others in 1987, was a response not only to government forces that downplayed or ignored the seriousness of AIDS in the United States, but also to a timid gay community who were not militant enough. Their first act was to march on Wall Street in New York City to protest the high price of AZT and the lack of other drugs to address HIV. They blocked morning rush hour traffic, a civil disobedience action in which several protesters were arrested, and the fledgling organization received national news coverage for their demonstration. ACT UP inspired the establishment of <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> groups Queer Nation, Pink Panthers and the Lesbian Avengers, that concentrated on gay and lesbian rights and protection.|$|E
