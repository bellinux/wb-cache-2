60|$|By {{daylight}} on the 9th {{we began}} to skirt Kauehi, and had now {{an opportunity to see}} near at hand the geography of atolls. Here and there, where it was high, the farther side loomed up; here and there the near side dipped entirely and showed a broad path of water into the lagoon; here and there both sides were equally abased, and we could look right through the <b>discontinuous</b> <b>ring</b> to the sea horizon on the south. Conceive, on a vast scale, the submerged hoop of the duck-hunter, trimmed with green rushes to conceal his head--water within, water without--you have the image of the perfect atoll. Conceive one that has been partly plucked of its rush fringe; you have the atoll of Kauehi. And for either shore of it at closer quarters, conceive the line of some old Roman highway traversing a wet morass, and here sunk out of view and there re-arising, crowned with a green tuft of thicket; only instead of the stagnant waters of a marsh, the live ocean now boiled against, now buried the frail barrier. Last night's impression in the dark was thus confirmed by day, and not corrected. We sailed indeed by a mere causeway in the sea, of nature's handiwork, yet of no greater magnitude than many of the works of man.|$|E

40|$|Kerlingarfjöll central volcano is Iceland’s {{second largest}} outcrop of Quaternary {{rhyolite}} and {{is part of}} the Icelandic Western Rift Zone. Geochemical and Ar/Ar age data show that at least 21 different rhyolite eruptions have taken place at Kerlingarfjöll over the last 350 ka. Ar/Ar dating was carried out on samples of obsidian which showed variable reproducibility, illustrating the difficulty in dating young Icelandic volcanics. Nevertheless, reasonable estimates of eruption age have been derived for a number of eruptive units that are consistent with observed stratigraphy, enabling an understanding of the temporal evolution of Kerlingarfjöll. Two rhyolite magma types are present. The first is an older, low-Nb rhyolite that was erupted episodically along a cryptic curved fracture system, to form a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>ring</b> of rhyolite mountains, between 350 and 250 ka. This <b>discontinuous</b> <b>ring</b> is similar to structures observed at other volcanoes in Iceland, suggesting that the development of a curved fracture that acts as a pathway for episodic silicic eruptions is a feature of central volcano development. The second magma is a younger, high-Nb rhyolite that was erupted episodically between 250 and 68 ka {{in the northern part of}} Kerlingarfjöll, forming two clusters, both of which have areas of intense hydrothermal activity. Repose periods for rhyolite volcanism are thought to be on the order of tens of thousands of years, and it is possible that Kerlingarfjöll will erupt rhyolite again in the future...|$|E

30|$|Cambial {{variants}} of liana stems {{are divided into}} two types: those that originate from a single cambium and those from multiple cambia (Angyalossy et al. 2012). Members of Piperaceae such as Manekia obtusa (Miq.) T.

The outer irregular series of primary vascular bundles, or cortical vascular bundles, always developed near the cortex or periderm. The inner irregular series of vascular bundles, the medullary vascular bundles, were always found around {{the center of the}} stem. The stem of P. gorgonillense produced wide, lignified rays, with solitary or clustered vessels (Trueba et al. 2015), and the stem of P. sarmentosum has a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>ring</b> of collenchyma in the outer cortex (Raman et al. 2012); these characteristics were not observed in this study.

40|$|We {{report on}} the unusual {{occurrence}} of the products of lava fountaining in a Pliocene calc-alkaline rhyolitic monogenetic center from northern Chile. Corral de Coquena is a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>ring</b> of lava located in the moat of La Pacana caldera (23 ° 27 ' S, 67 ° 23. 5 ' W), part of the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex of the Central Andes. The volcanic structure is composed of a maar-like crater, with an associated pyroclastic (possibly phreatomagmatic) unit, that is overlain by rhyolitic glassy lava ramparts, in which evidence of spatter, agglutinate and clastogenic material is found. Typical explanations for the unusual textures in a rhyolitic lava, such as peralkaline composition, high volatile content, or superheated magma are untenable in this case. We propose that the most likely explanation for this extreme style of rhyolitic volcanism {{is a combination of}} moderately high eruption rate and efficient degassing prior to eruption. In the light of reports of several other bodies of fountain-fed silicic magma from the UK, US, and Japan, we propose that Corral de Coquena is a rhyolitic spatter ring superimposed upon a maar-like crater. We further propose that pyroclastic fountaining should be considered an end-member of the spectrum of eruptive styles of calc-alkaline silicic magmas, and that Corral de Coquena is a rare example, preserved because of the hyper-arid climate in the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the formation of successive rings of cambia in Rivea hypocriteriformis Choisy (Convolvulaceae). The mature stem is composed of four to five rings of xylem alternating with phloem. Successive cambia originate as smaller and larger segments; union and anastomosing of small cambial segments often leads {{to the formation of}} <b>discontinuous</b> <b>rings.</b> In the initial stage of growth, several vascular bundles interconnect to form the first ring of vascular cambium. The cambium remains functional for one complete season and becomes dormant during summer; a new ring of cambium is completed prior to the subsequent monsoon season and sprouting of new leaves. Successive cambia are initiated from the pericyclic parenchyma situated three to four cell layers outside of the protophloem. Functionally, all the successive cambia are bidirectional and produce secondary xylem centripetally and phloem centrifugally. The secondary xylem is diffuse-porous, with indistinct growth rings and consisting of wide fibriform vessels, fibre tracheids, and axial and ray parenchyma cells. The xylem rays are uni- to multiseriate and heterocellular. The multiseriate rays contain lignified marginal ray cells and thin-walled, unlignified central cells. The central ray cells also show accumulations of starch and druses. Discrete strands of intraxylary phloem occur at the periphery of the pith, and additional intraxylary phloem develops from adjacent cells as secondary growth progresses. Earlier-formed phloem shows heavy accumulation of callose, followed by its compaction. The development of successive cambia is correlated with extension growth and with the phenology of the plant...|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} large-eddy simulation with subgrid scale (LES-SGS) stretched-vortex model of an inclined sonic jet into a supersonic crossflow at Mach 3. 6. The main flow features {{generated by the}} gas-dynamic interactions of the jet with the supersonic crossflow, such as barrel shock, shear layer, and counter-rotating vortex pair, are numerically captured by the employed LES-SGS. The transition and spatial development of the jet into a supersonic crossflow {{have been shown to}} be strongly dependent on the inflow conditions of the crossflow. This result indicates that correct turbulent inflow conditions are necessary to predict the main flow characteristics, dispersion and mixing of a gaseous jet in a supersonic, turbulent crossflow using LES-SGS. This work presents a methodology for the generation of realistic synthetic turbulent inflow conditions for LES of spatially developing, supersonic, turbulent, wall-bounded flows. The methodology is applied to the study of a supersonic turbulent flow over a flat wall interacting with an inclined jet. The effects of inflow conditions on the spatial development of the inclined jet are discussed, and then the results are compared with the available experimental data. Also, the dominant vortical structures generated by the jet/turbulent boundary layer interaction are identified as sheets, tilted tubes and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>rings,</b> and a visualization of their spatiotemporal development is provided.

Analysis of mutants similar to arc 5 along with map-based cloning identified PLASTID DIVISION 1 (PDV 1), an integral outer envelope membrane protein, and its homolog PDV 2 as components of the plastid division machinery. Similar to ARC 5, PDV 1 localized to a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>ring</b> at the division site in wild-type plants. The midplastid PDV 1 ring formed in arc 5 mutants and the ARC 5 ring formed in pdv 1 and pdv 2 mutants, but not in pdv 1 pdv 2. Stromal FtsZ ring assembly occurred in pdv 1, pdv 2, and pdv 1 pdv 2, as it does in arc 5. Topological analysis showed that the large N-terminal region of PDV 1 upstream of the transmembrane helix bearing a putative coiled-coil domain is exposed to the cytosol. Mutation of the conserved PDV 1 C-terminal Gly residue did not block PDV 1 insertion into the outer envelope membrane but did abolish its localization to the division site. Our results indicate that plastid division involves the stepwise localization of FtsZ, PDV 1, and ARC 5 at the division site and that PDV 1 and PDV 2 together mediate the recruitment of ARC 5 to the midplastid constriction at a late stage of division...|$|E

40|$|Stromgren {{studied the}} action of an {{extremely}} hot source on a diluted pure hydrogen cloud; a very ionized, spherical hydrogen plasma surrounded by neutral atomic hydrogen is formed. A relatively thin intermediate, partially ionized, hydrogen shell, is cooled by the radiation of the atoms. Stromgren was unaware of that this plasma, similar to the plasma of a gas laser, can be superradiant at several eigen frequencies of atomic hydrogen; the superradiant rays emitted tangentially with the sphere appear resulting from a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>ring</b> because of the competition of optical modes. The superradiance intensely depopulates the excited levels, including the continuum of proton-electron collisions, by cascades of transitions combined into resonant multiphotonic transitions so that the gas is cooled brutally beyond the radius of the Stromgren sphere. The extreme brightness of the rays emitted by the source allows a multiphotonic non-resonant absorption leading in stationary states or the ionization continuum. This absorption combines with the superradiant emissions in a multiphotonic diffusion induced by the superradiant rays. Although its brightness remains {{higher than that of}} the superradiant rays, the source becomes invisible if it is observed through a small solid angle. The lines emitted inside the sphere are all the more weak as they arrive of an internal area, lower in atoms, and more reddened also by a parametric transfer of energy towards the thermal radiation catalyzed by excited atomic hydrogen present in the sphere only.

40|$|During {{the final}} step of oogenesis, the oocyte nucleus is subject to {{large-scale}} modifications that correlate with transcriptional silencing. While oocytes with dense chromatin around the nucleolus are silent (SN, surrounded nucleolus), oocytes with uncondensed chromatin (NSN, non-surrounded nucleolus) are transcriptionally active. It is believed that epigenetic mechanisms that participate in gene expression regulation could {{play a role in}} this event. In this context, we examined the behaviour of heterochromatin and related histone modifications during the NSN to SN transition by immunostaining. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization on three dimensional-preserved nuclei (3 D-FISH), we also studied the distribution of centromeric, pericentromeric and ribosomal (rDNA) sequences in relation to the nucleolus (also called the nucleolus-like body, NLB). We observed that in NSN-type oocytes, pericentromeric heterochromatin is aggregated within chromocenters. In SN-type oocytes, pericentromeric heterochromatin and centromeres form a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>ring</b> around the NLB. rDNA sequences, which initially present a pearl necklace structure, gather together in seven highly condensed foci at the NLB periphery. H 3 K 9 me 3 and H 4 K 20 me 3 heterochromatin marks clearly label chromocenters, whereas H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 4 K 5 ac are totally excluded from heterochromatin regions, even in the very compact SN-nuclei. Remarkably, H 3 K 27 me 3 displays an intermediate behavior. It appears that GV oocyte nuclei exhibit a specific epigenetic landscape. Histone modifications, related to both active and repressive chromatin structures, seem to follow the large-scale chromatin movements that occur during the NSN to SN transition.

40|$|The shoot apical {{meristem}} (SAM) of Sinapis alba can be switched from vegetative to reproductive fate by exposure of 2 -month old plants {{to a single}} long day (LD). Floral transition then occurs in good synchrony within a population, {{and a number of}} biochemical, cellular, and morphological changes have been described. Our aim is to integrate gene expression patterns into this timing. We report here the analysis of SaLFY, orthologous to the floral meristem identity gene LEAFY of Arabidopsis. Materials and Methods: Plants of Sinapis were grown in 8 -h shorts days for two months before being induced to flower by one 22 -h LD. Shoot apices were harvested 24, 32, 40, 48, 56 and 80 h after start of the LD, and prepared for in situ hybridization (Melzer et al., 1999). Results and Conclusions: As expected, the expression of SaLFY was very strong in flower primordia. More surprisingly, SaLFY was expressed well before the initiation of flowers. First, a strong signal was detected in the tip of young leaf primordia of vegetative plants. Secondly, SaLFY was transiently expressed in the SAM of induced plants, from 32 h after the start of the LD, when cell proliferation increased. The signal formed, in transverse sections, a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>ring</b> with activation where last leaves were to be initiated. Interestingly, this activation in the SAM matched in time and space early growth changes previously described during the transition to flowering, namely an increase of leaf primordia growth and an acceleration of last leaf initiation (Bernier, 1997), suggesting that SaLFY may have dual functions in fate specification during the floral transition of the SAM.

These characteristics limit crossdating, especially for older trees, which are targets for accessing tree rings to reconstruct fire histories. Centuries to millennium-scale crossdating along the latitudinal distribution has recently been achieved via intensive within-tree sampling of standing redwoods in old-growth forests, which improves crossdating confidence related to dendroclimatic variation (Carroll et al. 2014, 2017).|$|R

The largest and oldest of these is Botticelli, a crater [...] in diameter centered at lat 64°N., long 110°W. Only the northernmost parts of the crater’s rim and interior lie within the mapped area, but the ghost remnant of an inner ring now flooded by smooth plains material is recognized (FDS 148) farther south in the Shakespeare quadrangle. Turgenev, [...] in diameter, is large enough to be a central-peak basin (Wood and Head, 1976), even though the peak ring probably has been concealed under smooth plains material. The rims of both Botticelli and Turgenev are covered with densely packed craters, most of which resemble the secondary craters that typically occur on intercrater plains material. Therefore, Botticelli and Turgenev are at least as old as intercrater plains material and may be equivalent in age to the Goethe impact basin. A similar argument can be advanced for the age of the Monteverdi Basin, 130 km in diameter, centered at lat 64° N., long 77° W. in the Victoria quadrangle.

40|$|Cross crater is a 65 km impact crater, {{located in}} the Noachian {{highlands}} of the Terra Sirenum region of Mars (30 °S, 158 °W), which hosts aluminum phyllosilicate deposits first detected by the Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, L’Eau, les Glaces et l’Activitié (OMEGA) imaging spectrometer on Mars Express. Using high-resolution data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, we examine Cross crater’s basin-filling sedimentary deposits. Visible/shortwave infrared (VSWIR) spectra from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) show absorptions diagnostic of alunite. Combining spectral data with high-resolution images, we map a large (10 km × 5 km) alunite-bearing deposit in southwest Cross crater, widespread kaolin-bearing sediments with variable amounts of alunite that are layered in < 10 m scale beds, and silica- and/or montmorillonite-bearing deposits that occupy topographically lower, heavily fractured units. The secondary minerals are found at elevations ranging from 700 to 1550 m, forming a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>ring</b> along the crater wall beneath darker capping materials. The mineralogy inside Cross crater {{is different from that}} of the surrounding terrains and other martian basins, where Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates and Ca/Mg-sulfates are commonly found. Alunite in Cross crater indicates acidic, sulfurous waters at the time of its formation. Waters in Cross crater were likely supplied by regionally upwelling groundwaters as well as through an inlet valley from a small adjacent depression to the east, perhaps occasionally forming a lake or series of shallow playa lakes in the closed basin. Like nearby Columbus crater, Cross crater exhibits evidence for acid sulfate alteration, but the alteration in Cross is more extensive/complete. The large but localized occurrence of alunite suggests a localized, high-volume source of acidic waters or vapors, possibly supplied by sulfurous (H_ 2 S- and/or SO_ 2 -bearing) waters in contact with a magmatic source, upwelling steam or fluids through fracture zones. The unique, highly aluminous nature of the Cross crater deposits relative to other martian acid sulfate deposits indicates acid waters, high water throughput during alteration, atypically glassy and/or felsic materials, or a combination of these conditions...|$|E
40|$|Dedicated to Professor Jyunji Inoue on his sixtieth {{birthday}} Abstract. We give {{a structure}} theorem for a ring homomorphism of a commutative regular Banach algebra into another commutative Banach algebra. In particular, it is shown that: (i) A ring homomorphism of a commutative C ∗-algebra onto another commutative C ∗-algebra with connected infinite Gelfand space is either linear or anti-linear. (ii) A ring automorphism of L 1 (R N) is either linear or anti-linear. (iii) C n ([a, b]), L 1 (R N) and the disc algebra A(D) are neither ring homomorphic images of ℓ 1 (S) norL p (G) (1 ≤p<∞,Ga compact abelian group). Let A and B be two commutative Banach algebras with Gelfand spaces ΦA and ΦB, respectively. Let ρ be a ring homomorphism of A into B such that {ρ(x) (ψ) :x∈A}=C, the complex field, for each ψ ∈ ΦB (“ ” denotes the Gelfand transform). This, of course, holds if ρ is onto. The {{purpose of this}} note is to show the following structure theorem of ρ applying the method which L. Molnar used in [5] to prove that a commutative semisimple Banach algebra which is the range of a ring homomorphism from a commutative C ∗-algebra must be C ∗-equivalent. Theorem 1. Suppose A is regular. Then there exist a continuous map ˆρ of ΦB into ΦA and a division {Φ 0 B, Φ 1 B, Φ 2 B} of ΦB such that Φ 1 B and Φ 2 B are closed, and for each a ∈ A, ρ(a) =â◦ˆρon Φ 1 B, ρ(a) = ¯ â ◦ ˆρ on Φ 2 B and ρ(a) (ψ) =τψ(â(ˆρ(ψ))) for every ψ ∈ Φ 0 B and for a certain <b>discontinuous</b> <b>ring</b> automorphism τψ of the complex field C. Moreover, if ρ is surjective, then ˆρ is injective, and if A satisfies the following condition (#), thenˆρ(Φ 0 B) is a finite set: (#) For any λn ∈ C with |λn|≤ 1 / 2 n(n= 1, 2, [...] .) and any sequence {ϕ 1,ϕ 2, [...] . } in ΦA such that each ϕn is an isolated point in {ϕ 1,ϕ 2, [...] . }, there exists an element a ∈ A such that â(ϕn) =λn(n= 1, 2, [...] .) ...|$|E
40|$|Image {{processing}} and computer-assisted analysis {{are very important}} in electron microscopy/crystallography, e. g., computer programs have been well developed for image {{processing and}} simulation for high-resolution electron microscopy images, and are widely used in research. Unfortunately, few computer programs {{have been developed for}} analysis and processing electron diffraction ring patterns. Facing this situation, Labar [1] developed ProcessDiffraction, a computer program to process electron diffraction patterns from polycrystalline and amorphous samples, with an aim to provides good angular resolution, quantified intensities, and reproducible identification of <b>discontinuous</b> and/or faint <b>rings.</b> For phase identification, it is to compare the generated diffractogram to the X-ray diffraction data bases. Li [2] developed JECP/PCED, a computer program for simulation of polycrystalline electron diffraction pattern and phase identification, which uses the raw or processed diffraction pattern as the input file and directly match to the simulated ring pattern.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} introduced deer on understory vegetation in some islands of Haida Gwaii by studying affected and control individuals of Salal, Red Huckleberry and Sitka Spruce. We analysed how browsing influences architecture, growth in diameter and the occurrence of traumatic anatomical features on cross-sections. For shrubs, a classical dendrochronological assessment of deer impact on growth has limited value because of high inter-shrub variance in ring-width series. However, samples from deer affected populations are characterized by abrupt changes in growth, {{that are associated with}} browsing scars, and by non circular cross-sections with altered wood areas, eccentric piths and several <b>discontinuous</b> or wedging <b>rings.</b> Deer affected and control populations differed statistically in these features. In spruce, severe browsing causes a shrubby growth form, with an overbranched crown and narrow growth rings. Browsing significantly decreases apical growth. When an individual tree becomes released from browsing, a sudden change in ring growth occurs. We studied the length of the time necessary for that change to occur and show that browsing induces, on average, an 8 year increase in the recruitment period in windthrows, delaying the process of habitat closing...|$|R
40|$|Medicine Lake Volcano is a Quaternary {{shield volcano}} {{located in a}} tectonically complex and active zone at the {{transition}} between the Basin and Range Province and the Cascade Range of the Pacific Province. The volcano is topped by a 7 x 12 km elliptical depression surrounded by a <b>discontinuous</b> constructional <b>ring</b> of basaltic to rhyolitic lava flows. This thesis explores {{the possibility that the}} depression may have formed due to regional extension (rift basin) or dextral shear (pull-apart basin) rather than through caldera collapse and examines the relationship between regional tectonics and localized volcanism. Existing data consisting of temperature and magnetotelluric surveys, alteration mineral studies, and core logging were compiled and supplemented with additional core logging, field observations, and fault striae studies in paleomagnetically oriented core samples. These results were then synthesized with regional fault data from existing maps and databases. Faulting patterns near the caldera, extension directions derived from fault striae P and T axes, and three-dimensional temperature and alteration mineral models are consistent with slip across arcuate ring faults related to magma chamber deflation during flank eruptions and/or a pyroclastic eruption at about 180 ka. These results are not consistent with a rift or pull-apart basin. Limited subsidence {{can be attributed to the}} relatively small volume of ash-flow tuff released by the only known major pyroclastic eruption and is inconsistent with the observed topographic relief. The additional relief can be explained by constructional volcanism. Striae from unoriented and oriented core, augmented by striae measurements in outcrop suggest that Walker Lane dextral shear, which can be reasonably projected from the southeast, has probably propagated into the Medicine Lake area. Most volcanic vents across Medicine Lake Volcano strike north-south, suggesting they are controlled by crustal weakness related to Basin and Range extension. Interaction of dextral shear, Basin and Range extension, and the zone of crustal weakness expressed as the Mount Shasta-Medicine Lake volcanic highland controlled the location and initiation of Medicine Lake Volcano at about 500 ka...|$|R
40|$|Chapter I Nuclei in the {{filamentous}} ascomycete Ashbya gossypii divide asynchronously {{and most}} nuclei {{have the potential}} to divide (Alberti-Segui et al., 2001; Gladfelter et al., 2006). Although cytoplasmic extension is restricted to growing tips and emerging branches, the distances between nuclei are uniform along the entire hyphal length. This implies active control of nuclear distribution and division to maintain an ideal nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, potentially depending on environmental conditions. The question of nuclear distribution has already been addressed earlier (Alberti-Segui et al., 2001). We have investigated how the rate of mitosis is regulated in response to intra- and extracellular signals. Here we show that homologues of S. cerevisiae morphogenesis checkpoint components are involved in starvation response in A. gossypii: Phosphorylation of the cyclin dependent kinase AgCdc 28 p at tyrosine 18 by the protein kinase AgSwe 1 p is used to delay mitosis under low-nutrient conditions, leading to an increase in the average distance between nuclei. This effect is markedly reduced in Agswe 1 Δ or Agcdc 28 Y 18 F mutants where the CDK cannot be phosphorylated. Overexpression of AgSWE 1 leads to decreased nuclear density even under non-starving conditions. Addition of rapamycin mimics starvation response, suggesting that AgSwe 1 p may be under control of AgTor 1 / 2 p. In unperturbed budding yeast cells, ScSwe 1 p is recruited to the septin ring at the mother-bud neck where it is phosphorylated and subsequently degraded. We have speculated that the septins in A. gossypii could serve as spatial markers to locally inactivate AgSwe 1 p and increase nuclear division rate in areas of growth. Time-lapse analysis has revealed that mitoses in wild type are most common near branching points. Interestingly, AgSep 7 p-GFP localizes to branching points and septin deletion mutants show random distribution of mitoses. We propose a model in which AgSwe 1 p may regulate mitosis in response to cell intrinsic morphogenesis cues and external nutrient availability in multinucleated cells. Chapter II Septins are evolutionary conserved proteins with essential functions in cytokinesis, and more subtle roles throughout the cell cycle. Much of our knowledge about septins originates from studies with S. cerevisiae, where they form a ring-like protein scaffold at the mother-bud neck. We have asked what functions the septins may hold in an organism that does not complete cytokinesis prior to sporulation. Interestingly, all budding yeast septins are conserved in A. gossypii and one is even duplicated (S. Brachat, personal communication; Dietrich et al., 2004). In vivo studies of AgSep 7 p-GFP have revealed that septins assemble into <b>discontinuous</b> hyphal <b>rings</b> close to growing tips and sites of branch formation and into asymmetric structures at the base of branching points. Rings are made of filaments which are long and diffuse close to growing tips and short and compact further away from the tip. During septum formation, the septin ring splits into two to form a double ring. Agcdc 3 Δ, Agcdc 10 Δ, and Agcdc 12 Δ mutants display aberrant morphology and are defective for actinring formation, chitin-ring formation, and sporulation. Due to the lack of septa, septin deletion mutants are highly sensitive, and lesion of a single hypha can have catastrophic consequences for a young mycelium. Strains lacking AgCDC 11 A show morphological defects comparable with other septin deletion mutants, but actin- and chitin-ring formation are not disabled. Deletion of AgCDC 11 B results in no detectable phenotype under standard laboratory conditions...|$|R
