25|$|A {{spillway}} is {{a section}} of a dam designed to pass water from the upstream side of a dam to the downstream side. Many spillways have floodgates designed to control the flow through the spillway. There are several types of spillway. A service spillway or primary spillway passes normal flow. An auxiliary spillway releases flow {{in excess of the}} capacity of the service spillway. An emergency spillway is designed for extreme conditions, such as a serious malfunction of the service spillway. A <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> <b>spillway</b> is a low embankment designed to be overtopped and washed away {{in the event of a}} large flood. The elements of a fuse plug are independent free-standing blocks, set side by side which work without any remote control. They allow increasing the normal pool of the dam without compromising the security of the dam because they are designed to be gradually evacuated for exceptional events. They work as fixed weirs at times by allowing over-flow for common floods.|$|E

50|$|In 2007, it {{was decided}} the dam would need an upgrade for safety reasons. The 70 million upgrade is {{expected}} to be completed during 2013 and Stage One involves the construction of a four-bay, 250 m-wide, <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> <b>spillway</b> at Diamond Bay to enable the dam to safely pass extreme floods. Once the fuse plug is installed the dam wall will be raised and the spillway gate modified.|$|E
5000|$|The dam wall is 35 m {{high and}} the {{buttress}} is 232 m long, and the embankment a further 167 m long. The maximum water depth is 30 m and at 100% capacity the dam wall holds back [...] of water at 1068 m AHD. The surface area of Lake Oberon is 410 ha and the catchment area is 140 km2. The concrete ski jump chute and <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> <b>spillways</b> are capable of discharging [...]|$|R
5000|$|The {{principle}} {{behind the}} <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> {{is that the}} majority of water that overflows a dam's spillway can be safely dammed except in high flood conditions. The <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> may be a sand-filled container, a steel structure or a concrete block. Under normal flow conditions the water will spill over the <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> and down the spillway. In high flood conditions, where the water velocity may be so high that the dam itself may be put in danger, the <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> simply washes away, and the flood waters safely spill over the dam.|$|R
50|$|In an {{intermediate}} type, normal level {{regulation of the}} reservoir {{is controlled by the}} mechanical gates. If inflow to the reservoir exceeds the gate's capacity, an artificial channel called either an auxiliary or emergency spillway that is blocked by a <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> dike will operate. The <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> is designed to over-top and wash out in case of a large flood, greater than the discharge capacity of the spillway gates. Although it may take many months to restore the <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> and channel after such an operation, the total damage and cost to repair is less than if the main water-retaining structures had been overtopped. The <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> concept is used where it would be very costly to build a spillway with capacity for the probable maximum flood.|$|R
50|$|In {{the week}} prior to failure, 4 to 5 inch cm of rain fell within 48 hours. This, {{combined}} with warm weather and {{an unusually large}} frost depth, led to the dam's failure. On May 14, 2003, the earthen <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> <b>spillway</b> of the dam failed and released nine billion gallons of water from Silver Lake Basin. The flood of water also caused {{the failure of the}} downstream Tourist Park Dam. The three other dams downstream of Silver Lake remained intact: Hoist Dam, McClure Dam, and Forestville Dam.|$|E
5000|$|The dam wall is 34.4 m {{high and}} 455 m long and holds back [...] of water when at full capacity. The {{surface area of}} the {{reservoir}} is 2.2 ha and the catchment area is 960 km2.

On May 14, 2003, the <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> <b>spillway</b> in the Silver Lake Dam failed, unexpectedly releasing nine {{billion gallons of}} water to flow down the Dead River. The dam at the Tourist Park failed, but the other upstream dams held. Remarkably, no lives were lost and no major injuries occurred. Property damage was estimated at about $100 million.

30|$|The {{importance}} of floodplain constriction by bridge structures is fairly well understood and various works have investigated these effects or calculated bridge scour at abutments in the floodplain (Kouchakzadeh and Townsend 1997). Additionally, {{there have been}} studies which describe the use of <b>fuse</b> <b>plugs</b> for flood mitigation (Jaffe and Sanders 2001; Pugh 1985; Schmocker et al. 2013). <b>Fuse</b> <b>plugs</b> allow access to floodplains during high flow events, {{and work on the}} assumption that increased floodplain access will result in non-local attenuation, i.e. attenuation of the flood wave away from the <b>fuse</b> <b>plug.</b> However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, prior research investigating the impacts of floodplain constriction (other than bridge structure constriction) on scour has not been published. A tool that can assess the relative sensitivity of bridge scour to floodplain access at different locations in a river reach has obvious benefits for this scenario.|$|R

50|$|The Barrage located 7 km {{downstream}} of Tarbela Dam, {{provides a}} pond which re-regulates the daily discharge from Tarbela by diverting the {{flow into the}} Power Channel, adding compensation water during the low flow seasons. The principal features include 20 No. standard bays, 8 No. under sluices and 8 No. head regulator bays in addition to rim embankments, <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> and dividing island. The Barrage can pass the design flood of 18,700 cumecs, equivalent to the flood of record.

5000|$|The Electrical Installations Committee {{which was}} convened in 1942 {{as part of}} the Post War Building Studies {{programme}} determined, amongst other things, that the ring final circuit offered a more efficient and lower cost system which would safely support a greater number of sockets.

Other designs of 13 A <b>fused</b> <b>plugs</b> and socket-outlets, notably the Wylex and Dorman & Smith systems, which did not conform to the chosen standard were used into the 1950s, but by the 1960s BS 1363 had become the single standard for new installations.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the design}} of a {{spillway}} for a dam, a <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> is a water retaining structure designed to wash out in a controlled fashion if the main dam is in danger of overtopping due to flood, and if the normal spillway channel is insufficient to control the over topping.|$|R
