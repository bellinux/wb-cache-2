40|$|The {{paper is}} based on a study on the uses of the {{telephone}} in 317 French homes. <b>Detailed</b> <b>billing</b> data over four months were collected and compared with interviews concerning each regular phone user in the household. We focus here on the correlation between the observed duration of phone calls and the gender of callers and receivers. The reasons why women telephone more are discussed and related to the gender homophily in telephone networks. Data also show that the duration of phone calls depends on the receiver's gender. We suggest that politeness rules may govern the telephone call, did we argue that these civility rules explain in part why the receiver's gender exerts the greatest effect on how the call is managed and on its overall duration. We propose to explore the hypothesis that telephone calls have an interactional format similar to that of a visit, but that status differences between caller and receiver may influence the unfolding of interactions between men and women through the caller's adjustment of his or her interaction style to the receiver's gender. Research on social uses of the telephone has systematically shown clear gender differences: women use the telephone at home more often than men (Chabrol and Périn 1993; Claisse an...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The ASSENT- 3 study {{examined}} the safety and efficacy of 3 alternative regimens for ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction: full-dose tenecteplase (TNK-tPA) plus enoxaparin; half-dose TNK-tPA plus unfractionated heparin plus abciximab; and full-dose TNK-tPA plus unfractionated heparin. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of the study was}} to examine the resource and economic effects of the 3 regimens in ASSENT- 3 using empirically collected data from the trial. METHODS: Cost estimates for each resource use component collected in ASSENT- 3 were derived from Medicare reimbursement rates and from <b>detailed</b> <b>billing</b> data collected as part of a previous study. Costs of study drugs were estimated using average wholesale prices. All analyses were by intention to treat. Resource use and medical costs were examined first in the United States alone, and then in the entire cohort. RESULTS: Differences in costs across treatment arms were primarily due to differences in cost of study medication. Irrespective of source of cost weights, the least expensive alternative among the 3 treatment regimens was TNK-tPA and enoxaparin. Although not statistically significant, in 80 % of 1000 bootstrap replications, the TNK-tPA enoxaparin arm was associated with 30 -day cost savings relative to the unfractionated heparin arm. CONCLUSION: The favorable clinical outcomes demonstrated for enoxaparin arm relative to the unfractionated heparin arm in ASSENT- 3 were accompanied by a favorable distribution of costs and support the designation of this regimen as economically attractive by conventional benchmarks. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{a belief}} that the use of {{cellular}} telephones while driving may cause colli-sions, several countries have restricted their use in motor vehicles, and others are considering such regulations. We used an epidemiologic method, the case—crossover design, to study whether using a cel-lular telephone while driving increases the risk of a motor vehicle collision. Methods We studied 699 drivers who had cellular telephones and who were involved in motor vehicle collisions resulting in substantial property damage but no personal injury. Each personÕs cellular-tele-phone calls {{on the day of the}} collision and during the previous week were analyzed through the use of <b>detailed</b> <b>billing</b> records. Results A total of 26, 798 cellular-telephone calls were made during the 14 -month study period. The risk of a collision when using a cellular telephone was four times higher than the risk when a cellular telephone was not being used (relative risk, 4. 3; 95 percent confidence interval, 3. 0 to 6. 5). The relative risk was similar for drivers who differed in personal characteristics such as age and driving experience; calls close to the time of the collision were particu-larly hazardous (relative risk, 4. 8 for calls placed within 5 minutes of the collision, as compared with 1. 3 for calls placed more than 15 minutes before the collision; P 0. 001); and units that allowed the hands to be free (relative risk, 5. 9) offered no safety advan-tage over hand-held units (relative risk, 3. 9; P not sig-nificant).
