5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics,</b> {{transport}} {{was in part}} {{provided by}} Vikingskipet Station on the Røros Line, which passes {{right next to the}} venue. The station is a cul-de-sac station which is electrified and allowed trains <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> and the Track Cycling World Championships to reach the venue within a short walk from the train. The station was officially opened on 16 August 1993. The station has not been used since the Olympics. In 2006, the Norwegian National Rail Administration proposed re-opening the station in conjunction with larger events.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, it was {{announced}} that Rebellin had tested positive for Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA, a third-generation form of erythropoietin) <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics.</b> After his B-sample subsequently confirmed initial results, he returned his medal and repaid the prize money he had won from the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) while still maintaining his innocence. Cancellara and original fourth-place finisher Alexandr Kolobnev were later awarded new medals corresponding to their updated finishing positions.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominant}} {{means of}} transport <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> was by railway. Spectators heading to Birkebeineren were transported by train to Hovemoen Station on the Dovre Line, and would then be transported by shuttle bus to the stadium. In addition, spectators from certain areas were transported by bus directly to the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Edler was {{responsible}} for a knee-on-knee hit to Carolina Hurricanes captain Eric Staal in {{the quarterfinals of the}} 2013 IIHF World Championship, and was suspended for the final two games of the championship. Sweden {{went on to win the}} gold medal, and Edler was awarded a medal even though he did not play in the gold medal game. On 29 July 2013, the IIHF extended the suspension to cover Sweden's first two games of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Edler later joined team Sweden <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> after his two-game suspension. He recorded a goal and two assists in the tournament, helping Sweden earn the silver medal.|$|E
5|$|Four Eurofighter Typhoon {{aircraft}} {{arrived at}} the station from RAF Coningsby on 2 May 2012 {{to take part in}} a security exercise as part of preparations for the 2012 Summer Olympics. During the Games, the aircraft were deployed to the station to provide air superiority protection for London, in conjunction with other security measures by the British Armed Forces. Westland Sea King helicopters of the Royal Navy were also deployed to the station. The presence of the aircraft <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> became the first time fighter aircraft had been stationed at RAF Northolt since the Second World War. The Typhoons and Sea Kings left Northolt on 16 August following the conclusion of the Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Tore Løkke was {{selected}} as the main contractor. Construction cost 20.3 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which NOK3.3 million was paid for by the municipality and NOK17 million was paid for by LOOC. The venue was completed in the fall of 1992 and was the first freestyle skiing arena in the world to feature a common spectator area for all three event hills. The temporary structures used <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> were completed in December 1993. A jibbing park was installed in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Two venues, Kristins Hall and Hafjell, {{were built}} before Lillehammer had been awarded the Olympics, {{although}} the former was only used for training <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics.</b> Lillehammer's incumbent ski jumping hill, Balbergbakken, {{was found to}} be unsuitable and Lysgårdsbakken was built instead. In the bid, the speed skating events were to be held at Stampesletta, an outdoor track and field stadium in Lillehammer. Only after Lillehammer had been awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics was it decided that an indoor venue would have to be built for the games. This started a debate about the location of the various ice rinks and resulted in the neighboring towns of Hamar and Gjøvik also receiving venues.|$|E
5|$|In the final, Jastremski {{attacked}} {{from the}} outset as expected, while O'Brien raced with a characteristically even pace. After being fourth at the halfway mark behind Jastremski, Prokopenko and Henninger, O'Brien panicked and accelerated in the third 50m and overtook Jastremski, leaving the American in fourth place. He then moved past Henninger, before overtaking Prokopenko. O'Brien's acceleration in the third meant that he tired at the end, but he had enough energy to fend off Prokopenko in the late stages to win {{the gold medal in}} a new world record time of 2min 27.8s, a margin of 0.4s, with Jastremski a further 1.4s in arrears. O'Brien had reduced his personal best time by more than four seconds <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> to claim an upset win.|$|E

5|$|The hill has a {{capacity}} for 35,000 spectators, of which 7,500 can be seated. In addition, up to 25,000 people can follow events from free areas around the venue. Auxiliary structures include a start house, a judges tower—which includes office space for organizers and judges—a media building, and a technical room below the stands, {{as well as a}} first aid room and restrooms. It also features a high-pressure snow production facility with outtakes all along the approach and outrun. Transport to the tower of the large hill is accessible via a chair lift. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics,</b> transport to the venues was mostly by railway. Spectators discharged at Lillehammer Station on the Dovre Line and would then walk to the stadium.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} 40 {{years of the}} tournament, Canada {{did not have a}} {{national}} team, instead choosing to send a club team, typically the Allan Cup winner. In 1960, the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen became the final club team to represent Canada at the Olympics. In 1962, Canada implemented a national team program, led by Father David Bauer. Between 1920 and 1952, seven Olympic ice hockey tournaments were held and Canada won six gold medals and a silver in 1936. The Soviet Union began competing in 1956 and frequently defeated the Canadian team. The Soviets won seven gold medals in nine tournaments; during that period Canada won a silver and two bronze medals. The Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes, so the players of the National Hockey League (NHL) and other professional leagues were not allowed to compete. Many of Canada's top players were professional, so the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) pushed for the ability to use professional and amateur players. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused, and Canada withdrew from the 1972 and 1976 Olympics in protest. In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games, starting in 1988. The NHL decided not to allow all players to participate in 1988, 1992 or 1994, because doing so would force the league to halt play <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics.</b> An agreement was reached in 1995 that allowed NHL players to compete in the Olympics, starting with the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. National teams are co-ordinated by Hockey Canada and players are chosen by the team's management staff.|$|E
25|$|TfL {{created a}} promotional {{campaign}} and website, Get Ahead of the Games, to help provide {{information related to}} transport <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> and Paralympics. Through the campaign, TfL also encouraged the use of cycling {{as a mode of}} transport during the Games. However, despite this encouragement to use bicycles, members of the public protested that riding bikes on London roads would be more dangerous due to the blocked Olympic lanes, and also protested against a decision to close the Lea Valley towpath <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> and Paralympics due to security concerns.|$|E
