Some visual effects elements—groups of birds and butterflies, were created completely in CG, though others were composited as visual effects from real-life elements.

There's a discipline to clear storytelling with these puppets. You want to be abstract, but one can easily go overboard with these critters because they aren't as familiar to the audience as real humans.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} Beholder Framework, {{which is}} a set of libraries designed to provide a single low-level API for modern real-time <b>graphics</b> that combines <b>clarity</b> of Direct 3 D 11 and portability of OpenGL. The first part of the paper describes the architecture of the framework and its reasoning {{from the point of view}} of developing a cross-platform graphics application. The second part describes how the framework overcomes some most notable pitfalls of supporting both Direct 3 D and OpenGL that are caused by differences in design and object models of the two APIs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} the general topic of color in the design of informational graphics. It is intended to promote effective usage of color, some of the components of which are a) purposeful, information-laden <b>graphics,</b> b) <b>clarity,</b> i. e., <b>graphics</b> that are relatively transparent to the information, c) efficiency, i. e., graphics that can be read quickly, and d) “truthfulness, ” i. e., graphics that transmit information that stands up to scrutiny. It promotes, at least implicitly, avoidance of color as chart junk, map junk, or multimedia junk—uses that are at best non-functional and at worst take our attention away from the information on which we should be focusing (cf. Tufte, 1983). Color is useful both in visualization (the use of graphics for discovery of information) and in presentation (the use of graphics to illustrate). Although that seems self-evident, one does hear people say things such as “oh, the colors don’t matter here; I’m just looking at the data. ” In other words, the speaker is implying that because only a few people at most will get a glimpse of the material and it is being used for discovery (visualization), color coding does not really matter. Likewise, we are probably all guilty of wanting to make things “too clear ” in presentation graphics. “I’m only showing thus and so ” implies that the rest of the representation does not matter (and perhaps an opportunity for conveying more information is missed).

[...] In their later review, they complimented the game on its inclusion of all the elements of the arcade version aside from the support for up to eight players, and remarked that though the graphics are not as good as the arcade version, they feature faster-moving polygons than any other cartridge game. They criticized the audio and low longevity but nonetheless concluded [...] "VR is the best 16-bit racer yet." [...] The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly scored it 31 out of 40 (average 7.75 out of 10). Like GamePro, they criticized the audio but held that the game, though not as good as the arcade version, was the best racer yet seen on cartridge-based systems. Famitsu magazine scored the Mega Drive version of the game 33 out of 40, calling it a [...] "groundbreaking" [...] port; later in September 1994, their Reader Cross Review gave it an 8 out of 10. Diehard GameFan stated that [...] "the speed, graphic intensity and addictive gameplay that made the arcade game a major hit are all included in this awe inspiring release." [...] Mega placed the game at number 4 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.|$|E
40|$|Draft for a {{monographic}} {{study on}} the Christian Topography of Cosmas Indicopleustes, a retired merchant who wrote his twelve books work in VI century Alexandria. The focus is on Book IV, since {{it is at the}} core of the Topography, epitomizing its cosmological ideas and biases while adding <b>graphics</b> for all <b>clarity.</b> For the very same reason it is translated here from the Greek in its completeness along with Cosmas' Introduction; the remaining books are drawn upon in the extensive commentary, where other cosmographers of Antiquity are frequently referred to as well. In his Topography Cosmas is propagating the idiosyncrasy of a Bible-based cubic universe, shaped as a huge box with a vaulted lid, in replacement of the common spheric model of the cosmos adhered to by the Hellenic scientists, and which he rejects as a mere product of the pagan mind. On closer investigation, his cosmology turns out to be ancillary to his christological message, and that's why he cannot resist digressing time and again in the areas of biblical history and exegesis, which, ill-placed though these may seem, show him to be a lesser Herodote of a narrator...|$|R
