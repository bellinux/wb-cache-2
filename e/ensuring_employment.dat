40|$|Since October 2009, the Greek {{sovereign}} debt problem has spiraled into crisis. By {{the end of}} last year, Greek national debt stood at 115 % of GDP, and the deficit had been revised up from 6 - 8 % to 13. 6 %. On April 27, 2010, international ratings agencies decreased Greek bonds to junk status. On May 1, Greece agreed to a series of austerity measures that convinced the previously reluctant Germany to support a bailout package for Europe but also set off massive strikes throughout Greece. An initial 110 billion euro bailout was replaced days later with a 750 billion euro ($ 100 trillion) bailout of which IMF will provide 250 billion euros and EU institutions the rest. Even this news did not prevent stock market drops worldwide. Spain too lost its AAA credit rating at the end of May, further fanning fears that the crisis could spread to the rest of Europe. Unfortunately, Greece faces two major obstacles to taking a truly proactive approach to recovering productivity. First, {{as a member of the}} Eurozone, which takes monetary policy out of national hands, Greece is unable to use monetary and fiscal measures in ways traditionally applied in such a situation. Second, this structural difficulty has been further exacerbated by the prevailing ideological approach to the European debt crisis, which has been framed in terms of restoring international creditworthiness and protecting foreign creditors, rather than in terms of <b>ensuring</b> <b>employment</b> and basic social needs for citizens...|$|E
40|$|LL. M. (Mercantile Law) Rescue {{refers to}} the {{restructuring}} of a company which would be {{necessary in order to}} preserve the said company and reinstate the entity‟s status to one of viability and profitability. One of the success factors of a business rescue is to develop and implement a business rescue plan, with one of the critical components of a successful business rescue plan involving securing post-commencement finance, which would be necessary to adhere to trade obligations as well as attempting to restore the company to a solvent position. The absence of post-commencement finance can result in the failure of business rescue altogether and thus the Companies Act has introduced a system of preference ranking in order to stimulate the required funding. This classification is encapsulated in section 135 of Chapter 6 in the Companies Act 71 of 2008. There is a prevalent shift of ideology from placing restrictions on a distressed company and a movement towards a capitalist approach creating a foundation for growth and re-entrance into the economy whereby distressed companies may continue as going concerns in terms of section 7 (c) of the Companies Act, which will ultimately improve trade through the adherence to international standards <b>ensuring</b> <b>employment</b> as well as economic social benefits in section 7 (d) of the Companies Act. The focus on distressed companies has allowed for the emphasis of previous legislation to be shifted away from a creditor-friendly approach to a debtor-friendly approach.

40|$|Lignite (brown coal) is Greece's most {{important}} energy mineral raw material. Lignite exploitation {{has made a}} highly {{significant contribution to the}} development of energy sector of Greece on past 50 years, and will, according to estimations, continue to supply energy for another 40 years. Greece is very rich in Lignite resources. The two main basins - from where Lignite is extracted by opencast mining - are a) in Western Macedonia (northen Greece) where is generated the 70 % of the whole electricity of Greece and b) in Central Peloponese (Southern Greece) where is generated the 10 % of the whole electricity of Greece. In this respect, Public Power Corporation of Greece cooperates with the local administrative authorities and finances or undertakes social "compensation" projects for life improvement, and social and financial support of the residential areas near mines. Also provides technical services and contributes to the carrying out of small projects in municipalities and communities. Finaly provides thermal energy from the power stations for the district teleheating of the towns of Kozani, Ptolemais and Megalopolis and surrounting settlements. In addition to the works of social regeneration and the duty for the development of industrial areas, for the redevelopment works and environmental protection of the new ground at the lignite mines, more than 500. 000 Euros are spent on a yearly basis (350. 000 Euros at West Macedonia and 150. 000 Euros at Central Peloponese). Moreover, according to data taken from the statement of accounts regarding only the operation of the mines (salaries, commossions, contracts assigned etc) the amount of 367. 000. 000 Euros is spent in the local societies of Kozani and Florina Prefectures. As a result, Lignite contributes to the regional Development of the country.

40|$|Coal {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} types of fuel and energy resources. Fuel and non-fuel products of new consumer properties can be produced on its basis. Implementation of the accumulated technological potential of coal conversion is an up-to-date trend of the coal industry innovative development in Russia and in the Primorye Territory as well. The Primorye Territory is the second region in Russia by consumption volume of fuel oil for the needs of housing and utility services. Twenty percent of the region boilers are working using this type of fuel. Fuel oil for Primorye is imported from other regions. In this regard, one of the main problems in the housing sector of the Primorye Territory is the provision of furnace fuel oil and its high cost for the budget to be able to purchase the fuel for the heating season. To solve this problem it has been proposed to organizesynthetic liquid fuels production using Primorsky brown coal. The technology for converting coal into synthetic liquid fuels was developed long ago. The research of coal processing is being done all over the world now. Coal is the most perspective raw material for the production of synthetic liquid fuel in Russia, because it is the most common form of fossil fuels. Brown coals are the most perspective for processing, because there are considerable reserves of this kind of coal, it is of relatively low cost, due to their consumer properties they are limited for using in heating and electricity production. The primary objective is to develop the design and estimating documentation for constructing plants with the capacity of 500 thousand tons of liquid products per year in the areas situated far from refineries and having coal-mining enterprises, including unprofitable and surface coal mines. Primorye Territory belongs to such areas. The implementation of this project in Primorye has a significant socio-economic efficiency, which results in the budget savings, the creation of new jobs, <b>ensuring</b> <b>employment</b> in miner's villages, and additional tax revenues to the budget. There are all opportunities to realize this project in Primorye on the basis of Pavlovsky brown coal deposit with 400 million tons reserves to use for more than 130 years...|$|E
40|$|The 1990 s {{represent}} an exceptionally complex {{period for the}} population of Serbia. In addition {{to the impact of}} long-term factors, various tumultuous events affected its demographic development, such as breaking apart of former Yugoslavia, armed conflicts in the neighboring countries, sanctions imposed by the international community, social changes (transition transformation or regression), deep economic crisis, collapse of social stratification political problems, institutional crisis, and NATO military intervention. Maladjustment to the changed system of values and norms, lower level of personal attainment, feeling of insecurity, and living under permanent stress are the main features of life at an individual psychological level. Deprivation or living at the subsistence level are the main elements of the economic cost sustained by the majority of the population. How have these changes affected an individual's decision to have children? The analysis of futility indicators points to an obvious {{decline in the number of}} births across low fertility regions of Serbia. Also, the analysis has raised the question why the decline in population fertility in the low fertility regions was not even higher, bearing in mind the experiences undergone by the countries with economy in transition as well as the depth of the crisis in society. In that sense several factors come to mind. The most important are the universality of marriage socio-psychological investigations confirmed domination of the traditional character or mentality in Serbia during the 1990 s, and the government’s approach to the issue of fertility improved during this time. Besides demographic needs were carefully taken into account in all amendments to the old and formulation of the new measures in the area of social policy. Mention should be made of measures <b>ensuring</b> <b>employment</b> rights of women and their entitlement to maternity leave, maternity pay, and provision of institutionalized care for the children. On the other hand under-reporting of live births, lack of knowledge on the size and characteristics of emigration flows limited the analysis of population fertility in Kosovo and Metohia.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} the ways in which states are still significant actors in creating and shaping the nature and characteristics of global labour markets. My argument is demonstrated through an empirical case study of the global labour market for British seafarers. Problem Investigated: The last 30 years has witnessed a decimation of the number of employed British seafarers, particularly at lower rank levels, such as ratings. I contend that despite Britain's long and rich maritime history, the British state has not acted meaningfully to reverse the decline of British seafarers. The lack of meaningful action I contend is an attempt to crew British owned ships with cheaper seafaring labour from Asia, particularly south east Asia. In so doing the British state has contributed to the decline of a once thriving labour market. There has simultaneously been an upsurge in the employment of seafarers of other nationalities, and thus the creation of new labour markets in countries such as the Philippines. This paper is an attempt to understand some of the factors responsible for the decline of the British labour market for seafarers. Methodology and Approach: This paper is the outcome of a larger qualitative study undertaken for my doctoral thesis in industrial sociology which examined the transformation of the global labour market for South African, Filipino and British seafarers. The methodology consists of in depth interviews with maritime officials and trade union leaders. These were conducted in person in London, United Kingdom between 2005 and 2008. These interviews are supported by extensive literature and documentary research, to validate, support and test claims made by my interviewees. Implications and Value of the Research: The theoretical contribution of this paper is to reinsert the state more critically into the literature on labour markets. Empirically, seafaring labour markets are largely ignored by the disciplines of both sociology and commerce. The paper attempts to fill this gap by investigating a much neglected occupational sector. Very little empirical work is being done by South African researchers on global labour markets outside South Africa. This paper is therefore primarily addressed to a South African audience. Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that the state has to be a willing and active partner in <b>ensuring</b> <b>employment</b> security of its worker-citizens in global labour markets. The private sector and organised labour by themselves are unable or unwilling to prevent massive job losses without state intervention. As increasing numbers of workers join global labour markets, states need to become more involved rather than less involved in ensuring the stability of employment for their citizens. </p...|$|E
