5|$|For {{passenger}} {{service the}} F40PH has another electrical alternator, the head-end generator. The HEP unit generates three-phase AC power at 480 V (500kW {{on the first}} order, 800kW on later units) for lighting, heating and air-conditioning the train. Originally, F40PHs powered the HEP alternator from the prime mover; from the <b>head</b> <b>end</b> to the train must be a constant frequency, and the prime mover had to turn at a constant 893 RPM while supplying <b>head</b> <b>end</b> power (even standing still, with the throttle in idle). Power to the traction motors was controlled by varying the field excitation of the main (traction) generator. On some later versions of the F40PH (and on many rebuilt F40s), a second small diesel engine {{at the rear of}} the locomotive powers the HEP alternator. In these engines, the prime-mover speed varies in the usual way; they can be identified by the diesel exhaust {{at the rear of the}} locomotive and by their quiet idle. Remaining F40s, with the constant-RPM prime movers, are noticeably louder.|$|E

25|$|When the Milwaukee Road {{purchased}} new Budd Company {{stainless steel}} bilevel cars in 1961, the Rock Island elected {{to add to}} a subsequent order and took delivery of its first bilevel equipment in 1964. Power for these new cars was provided by orphaned passenger units: three EMD F7s, an EMD E6, and the two EMD AB6s. The power was rebuilt with <b>head</b> <b>end</b> power to provide heat, air conditioning, and lighting for the new cars. In 1970, another order, this time for Pullman-built bilevel cars arrived to further supplement the fleet. To provide the power for these cars, several former Union Pacific EMD E8 and EMD E9 diesels were rebuilt with <b>head</b> <b>end</b> power and added to the commuter pool.|$|E

25|$|Today the {{carriages}} {{are normally}} hauled by N class diesel locomotives. The carriages can use an external <b>head</b> <b>end</b> power supply for lighting {{and air conditioning}} operation. Each carriage has two swing doors per side, which were originally manually opened by passengers, but have since been converted to powered operation, and they are locked or unlocked by the conductor. Toilets, drinking fountains and luggage areas are provided throughout each carriage set.|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} factors to {{consider}} when deciding between ceiling- and floor-mounted systems. Ceiling-mounted systems require substantial ceiling space and, therefore, reduce the options to install surgical lights or booms. Nonetheless, many hospitals choose ceiling-mounted systems because they cover the whole body with more flexibility and – most importantly – without moving the table. The latter is sometimes a difficult and dangerous undertaking during surgery with the many lines and catheters that must also be moved. Moving from a parking to a working position during surgery, however, is easier with a floor-mounted system, because the C-arm just turns in from the side and does {{not interfere with the}} anesthesiologist. The ceiling-mounted system, by contrast, during surgery can hardly move to a parking position at the <b>head</b> <b>end</b> without colliding with anesthesia equipment. In an overcrowded environment like the OR, biplane systems add to the complexity and interfere with anesthesia, except for neurosurgery, where anesthesia is not at the <b>head</b> <b>end.</b> Monoplane systems are therefore clearly recommended for rooms mainly used for cardiac surgery.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, the shafts of {{mattocks}} are often {{fitted with a}} screw below the head and parallel with it to secure the head from slipping down the shaft, but in the western United States, where tools are more commonly dismantled for transport, this is rarely done. When made to be dismantled, the shaft of a mattock fits into the oval eye of the head, and is fixed by striking the <b>head</b> <b>end</b> of the shaft against a solid surface, such as a tree stump, rock, or firm ground. The <b>head</b> <b>end</b> of the shaft is tapered outwards, and the oval opening of the iron head is similarly tapered so that the head will not fly off when used. The mattock head ought never be raised higher than the user's hands, {{so that it will}} not slide down and hit the user's hands. The mattock is meant for swinging between the user's legs, as in digging a ditch with one foot on either side. Tapping the handle end of the shaft while holding the head allows the handle to slide down and be removed.|$|E

The Ukrkosmos platform includes the channels UTR, Kultura, KDRTRK, Sport 1, Sport 2, Malyatko TV and Menu TV. The second agreement was with Central European Media Enterprises (CME) which contracted a transponder on Astra 1G for distribution of services to cable <b>head</b> <b>ends</b> in Romania and Bulgaria, starting in January 2011.

25|$|Many older {{structures}} were fabricated by inserting red-hot rivets into pre-drilled holes; the soft rivets are then peened using an air hammer {{on one side}} and a bucking bar on the <b>head</b> <b>end.</b> As these cool slowly, they are left in an annealed (soft) condition, while the plate, having been hot rolled and quenched during manufacture, remains relatively hard. Under extreme stress the hard plates can shear the soft rivets, resulting in failure of the joint.|$|E
25|$|In {{the male}} the duct persists, and forms the tube of the epididymis, the ductus deferens and the {{ejaculatory}} duct, while the seminal vesicle arises {{during the third}} month as a lateral diverticulum from its hinder end. A {{large part of the}} <b>head</b> <b>end</b> of the mesonephros atrophies and disappears; of the remainder the anterior tubules form the efferent ducts of the testis; while the posterior tubules are represented by the ductuli aberrantes, and by the paradidymis, which is sometimes found in front of the spermatic cord above the head of the epididymis.|$|E
25|$|They spin a tubular web, {{often in}} cracks of buildings. Six or more silken lines radiate from it, and the spider waits in the entrance, {{touching}} the lines with the frontal six legs. Prey triggering these lines get caught, and the spider immediately retreats again to eat it. However, {{in some cases}} the spider will kill and begin to consume its prey in the opening of the tube, but will retreat further if disturbed. They hunt nocturnal insects such as moths and cockroaches. Bees and wasps are always bitten at the <b>head</b> <b>end,</b> so the sting will face away from the spider.|$|E

25|$|The A class rebuild {{contract}} was let in January 1983 to Clyde Engineering in Rosewater, South Australia. The first entered service in May 1984, but {{the project was}} abandoned in mid 1985 after rising costs due to structural fatigue. The 11th rebuild was delivered in August 1985. The N class were a new-build locomotive, mechanically similar to the A class. The major difference was the addition of <b>head</b> <b>end</b> power units, as it was believed this was a more efficient way of supplying power for air-conditioning and lighting than power vans or axle driven generator sets under carriages.|$|E
25|$|The N class {{feature a}} {{frame and body}} locally designed, but with {{imported}} Electro-Motive Division technology in the prime mover, generator and control unit, along with locally produced components such as the bogie frames by Bradford Kendall.

The 240kW generator provides 415V 3-phase AC power for train lighting, air conditioning and other carriage requirements.|$|E
