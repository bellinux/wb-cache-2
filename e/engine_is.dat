The other <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> the V6 engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. This <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> only {{offered in the}} top-of-the-line Q trim. The Camry has enjoyed success in Indonesia, being the best selling car in its class. The 2.4 V and 3.5 Q models have been used extensively by the Indonesian government, owning thousands of Camrys in their fleet.|$|E

5|$|The Ricardo {{study also}} found that the {{lifecycle}} carbon emissions for mid-sized gasoline and diesel vehicles are almost identical, and that the greater fuel efficiency of the diesel <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> offset by higher production emissions.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} projects in the application of combined heat and power(CHP) lies in energy production for buildings. Stirling <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> very applicable to residential buildings, especially because of the higher electricity/heat efficiency. A literature review on stirling <b>engines</b> <b>is</b> first provided and a number of research works on the development and applications of Stirling <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> discussed. Then according to buildings' energy consumption, relevant output of power density of Stirling <b>engines</b> <b>is</b> estimated. From the results, the design parameters of Stirling <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> derived and the temperature difference on frequency and performance of Stirling <b>engines</b> <b>is</b> also discussed...|$|R

5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
25|$|Most radial <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> air-cooled, {{but one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} of the early radial <b>engines</b> <b>was</b> the Salmson 9Z series of nine-cylinder water-cooled radial <b>engines</b> that <b>were</b> produced in large numbers during the First World War. Georges Canton and Pierre Unné patented the original engine design in 1909, offering it to the Salmson company; the <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> often known as the Canton-Unné.|$|R
50|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} specifically for the GEN H-4 helicopter, in which four of the <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> mounted to provide redundancy.|$|R

5|$|The California Air Resources Board (CARB) {{classified}} the Volt as Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV), as CARB tests do {{not account}} for the Volt electric range. With all tests conducted under conditions where the <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> running the CARB rated the Volt's carbon monoxide (CO) emissions at 1.3 g/mile (0.81 g/km), missing the limit for SULEV classification by 0.3 g/mile (0.19 g/km).|$|E
5|$|The {{low-pressure}} {{oxygen and}} low-pressure fuel turbopumps were mounted 180° apart on the orbiter's aft fuselage thrust structure. The {{lines from the}} low-pressure turbopumps to the high-pressure turbopumps contain flexible bellows that enable the low-pressure turbopumps to remain stationary {{while the rest of}} the <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> gimbaled for thrust vector control, and also to prevent damage to the pumps when loads were applied to them. The liquid-hydrogen line from the LPFTP to the HPFTP is insulated to prevent the formation of liquid air.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{missions}} {{in which the}} player controls a motor vehicle. Though the game <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> {{the same as the}} third-person mode, these missions are based on being in a vehicle. They usually involve getting to a certain location in a certain time period, often while avoiding pursuers while heading to the end point. Weapons can not be used while in a vehicle. While the PDA is not available in these mission types, a map of the city is. Cell phone calls are also sometimes received in these missions.|$|E

50|$|Water {{flow from}} the Bollin was {{unreliable}} so an auxiliary steam <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> procured in 1810. It was a 10 hp beam engine from Boulton and Watt. In 1836 {{with the arrival of}} power looms a second 20 hp Boulton and Watt beam <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> acquired. The first horizontal condensing <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> acquired in 1871. A new <b>engine</b> house <b>was</b> built. In 1906 the 1871 <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> replaced by a second-hand 60 hp engine. The engines no longer exist and the museum has purchased a similar steam engine to display.|$|R
50|$|As well as {{changes to}} the {{existing}} engines, a new 1.9-litre inline-four <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> introduced. Known as the Starfire four, the new <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> the 2.85-litre blue inline-six engine with two cylinders removed. Also used in the UC Sunbird, this <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> fitted to the Commodore in response to increasing pressure from the 1979 energy crisis. This new <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> not a complete success however, as its lack of power meant the <b>engine</b> needed to <b>be</b> pushed hard to deliver acceptable performance, negating any fuel saving benefits.|$|R
