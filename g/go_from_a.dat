5|$|The {{history of}} life {{was that of the}} {{unicellular}} eukaryotes, prokaryotes and archaea until about 610 million years ago when multicellular organisms began to appear in the oceans in the Ediacaran period. The evolution of multicellularity occurred in multiple independent events, in organisms as diverse as sponges, brown algae, cyanobacteria, slime moulds and myxobacteria. In January 2016, scientists reported that, about 800 million years ago, a minor genetic change in a single molecule called GK-PID may have allowed organisms to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single cell organism to one of many cells.|$|E

25|$|Twenty20 match {{format is}} a form of limited overs cricket in that it {{involves}} two teams, each with a single innings, the key feature being that each team bats for a maximum of 20 overs. In terms of visual format, the batting team members do not arrive from and depart to traditional dressing rooms, but come and <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> bench (typically a row of chairs) visible in the playing arena, analogous to association football's technical area or a baseball dugout.|$|E
25|$|At {{first we}} used a {{character}} {{that looked like a}} rabbit with ears that could extend and pick up objects. As the game got faster and faster, we needed {{to come up with a}} special characteristic to give our character some power over his enemies. I remembered a character I had thought about years ago who could roll himself into a ball and slam into enemies. Hedgehogs can roll themselves into a ball, so we decided to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E
25|$|Multicellular organisms {{may have}} first evolved through the {{formation}} of colonies like cells. These cells can form group organisms through cell adhesion. The individual members of a colony are capable of surviving on their own, whereas {{the members of a}} true multi-cellular organism have developed specializations, making them dependent on the remainder of the organism for survival. Such organisms are formed clonally or from a single germ cell that is capable of forming the various specialized cells that form the adult organism. This specialization allows multicellular organisms to exploit resources more efficiently than single cells. In January 2016, scientists reported that, about 800 million years ago, a minor genetic change in a single molecule, called GK-PID, may have allowed organisms to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single cell organism to one of many cells.|$|E

After two months of filming, Penry-Jones began to feel more at ease with the role. He felt especially so after he started working for the fourth series. He returned to the fourth series because he thought his character took off by the end of the last series, and wanted to see which direction he would go to next. The crew wanted Adam to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> [...] "happy-go-lucky" [...] figure to wanting him to deal with things that would make it hard for Adam to be jokey towards the end of the fourth series; this involved Fiona's death.|$|E

Charles was separated from spectators by large ranks of soldiers, and his last speech reached only those with him on the scaffold. He blamed his fate on his failure to prevent the execution of his loyal servant Strafford: [...] "An unjust sentence that I suffered to take effect, is punished now by an unjust sentence on me." [...] He declared that he had desired the liberty and freedom of the people as much as any, [...] "but I must tell you that their liberty and freedom consists in having government... It is not their having a share in the government; that is nothing appertaining unto them. A subject and a sovereign are clean different things."

500|$|Between 2013 and 2016, Sheen {{starred in}} and {{produced}} Showtime's Masters of Sex. He and Lizzy Caplan portrayed the 1960s human sexuality pioneers Masters and Johnson; the series chronicled [...] "their unusual lives, romance and pop culture trajectory, which saw them <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Midwestern teaching hospital to {{the cover of}} Time magazine and Johnny Carson's couch". David Sims of The Atlantic described Sheen's portrayal of Masters as [...] "an intensely honest and unsympathetic one" [...] while Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club said Sheen played the role [...] "so seamlessly it's hard to remember that there's a British actor there who has played flamboyant news personalities and prime ministers." [...] Sean T. Collins of The Observer described Masters as [...] "a singularly unappealing figure": [...] "It's not that Michael Sheen is bad in the role. On the contrary! Sheen's skill in playing Masters as an asshole who oscillates between headache-inducing self-repression and volcanic rage renders him unpleasant {{to spend more than}} two minutes with at a time." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter remarked: [...] "Masters has never been very likable. In fact, it's a testament to Sheen's performance — and Caplan's nuanced Johnson offsetting Masters — that anyone still cares what happens to Masters on a personal level." [...] He received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in late 2013.|$|E

500|$|The {{first cut}} of the episode ran 37 minutes long and the {{producers}} were tasked with cutting the footage down to 22 minutes. Executive producer Greg Daniels considered making the episode a two-parter, one focusing on the Alliance and another focusing on Meredith's birthday party, but the appearance of party hats in the Alliance-only scenes caused him to nix this idea. Because the episode had to be cut down due to time, several scenes were drastically cut. The filming crew actually shot about 15–20 minutes of Steve Carell coming up with terrible card ideas, which was drastically cut for the episode. During the party, Ryan talks to a different woman {{in the background of}} each scene. Although not much footage made it into the final episode, the producers thought this was a nice character touch for the new employee. The penultimate scenes of Michael telling several terrible jokes to Meredith was cut down from the original 15. The final scene where Roy confronts Jim was shot ten different times, each in a different style, ranging from Roy slamming Jim into the wall to Roy asking Jim, [...] "Hey, what are you doing?" [...] Although the crew felt that the wall-slamming version was more dramatic, they realized that it caused the episode to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> comedy to an [...] "angry drama." ...|$|E

According to Josh Michaels, the idea of apartment slots (before apartment ownership was introduced) was borrowed from an IRC chat room.
