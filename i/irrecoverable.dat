5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to {{engage and disengage}} from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to <b>irrecoverable</b> spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly {{on the edge of}} its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed.|$|E
5|$|A {{document}} prepared on 17 July 1943 by the 5th Guards Tank Army headquarters summarised {{the combat}} losses incurred by the formation from 12 to 16 July inclusive {{for all of}} its five corps, as well as smaller units directly subordinated to the army headquarters. The document reported the following <b>irrecoverable</b> losses: 222 T-34s, 89 T-70s, 12 Churchills, 8 SU-122s, 3 SU-76s, and 240 support vehicles. The document reported damaged vehicles still under repair as 143 T-34s, 56 T-70s, 7 Churchills, 3 SU-122s, and 3 SU-76s, with no figures for support vehicles. The document reported personnel casualties as 2,940 killed in action, 3,510 wounded in action, and 1,157 missing in action. This totals 334 irrevocable losses in tanks and self-propelled guns, with another 212 tanks and self-propelled guns under repair, and 7,607 casualties. The historian Karl-Heinz Frieser argued that the majority of these losses must have occurred on 12 July.|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} 138,367 battle {{casualties}} (15,364 KIA, 34,199 WIA, 10,069 MIA, 78,735 POW). It {{should be noted}} that the WIA figures only include <b>irrecoverable</b> losses (crippled or later died of wounds). Going by the Erickson's estimates, total wounded outnumbered seriously wounded by 2.5:1 for the war. Applying that same ratio to the Sinai and Palestine Campaign produces a total battle casualty count of about 189,600 (15,364 KIA, 10,069 MIA, 85,497 WIA, 78,735 POW). Furthermore, his listed ratio of disease deaths to KIA implies about 40,900 disease deaths in Sinai-Palestine. This would add up to total casualties of roughly 230,500 (15,364 KIA, 10,069 MIA, 40,900 died of disease, 85,497 WIA/DOW, 78,735 POW).|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{headed by}} Prokofiev arrived on site on horseback 24 {{hours after the}} crash and issued their first {{statement}} on February 1. They acknowledged that the crew died of high speed impact at 16:21 Moscow time; the flight logs, found intact, revealed that the crewmembers were unaware of imminent catastrophe until 16:10, when the balloon descended to 12,000 meters. This moment was marked {{as the beginning of}} an <b>irrecoverable</b> dive. Airspeed beyond design limits snapped the suspension cables and tore open the envelope; eventually the gondola completely separated from the falling balloon. There was no evidence of icing despite early reports in Pravda. Autopsy ruled out suffocation or poisoning of the crew; barograph tape indicated normal internal air pressure throughout the flight.|$|E
25|$|Most councillors contemplating delaying {{setting a}} rate {{considered}} that the crucial point would {{come at the}} point in the year when the first rate payments would have become due; if the council had not set a rate at that point, it would be unable to recover the interest on the payments due to have been made to it. The General Rate Act 1967 section 50 and schedule 10 gave ratepayers the right to pay by ten instalments which were to be paid at monthly intervals during the year. With a financial year ending on 31 March, the latest date to start the payment was 1 July; the council had to give ten days' notice of a payment being due, so the latest date for setting a rate without incurring <b>irrecoverable</b> debts was 20 June.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to seize the initiative, reprovision, protect farms in mid-growing season and {{influence}} U.S. Congressional elections, two major Confederate incursions into Union territory had been launched in August and September 1862. Both Braxton Bragg's invasion of Kentucky and Lee's invasion of Maryland were decisively repulsed, leaving Confederates in control of but 63% of its population. Civil War scholar Allan Nevins argues that 1862 was the strategic high-water mark of the Confederacy. The failures of the two invasions were attributed to the same <b>irrecoverable</b> shortcomings: lack of manpower at the front, lack of supplies including serviceable shoes, and exhaustion after long marches without adequate food. Also in September Confederate Gen. William W. Loring pushed Federal forces from Charleston, Virginia, and the Kanawha Valley in western Virginia, but lacking re-inforcements Loring abandoned his position and by November the region was back in Federal control.|$|E
25|$|She {{was lost}} off Mangalore on 26 November 1780. The British were {{at war with}} Hyder Ali, Sultan of Mysore, and Vernon wanted to destroy Hyder Ali's small navy. When the {{squadron}} arrived off Callicut Road on 24 November a distant, ineffective engagement ensued. Although the British captured one of Hyder Ali's vessels, the remainder were anchored close to shore. Vernon ordered Simonton to lighten Sartine and move her closer. Simonton, noting that Sartine was already in only three fathoms, was not enthused, but followed orders and by the afternoon she was anchored in shallow water. However, it then became apparent that she was aground. By {{the afternoon of the}} next day she was gotten off after her crew threw some of her guns overboard. When she anchored in deeper water it was found that she was taking on water. Efforts were made on the 26th to stop the leaks, but they were futile. She flooded and was <b>irrecoverable.</b> Some of her sails, masts, and stores were rescued. The subsequent court martial absolved Simonton of all blame.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman 3rd Army {{started with}} 118,000 {{fighting}} men. It {{was reduced to}} 42,000 effective soldiers in January 1915, with an additional 12,000 in the Erzurum fortress garrison. 25,000 Turkish troops had become casualties even before the battle started, 30,000 frozen bodies were found by the Russians after the battle, and the entire Third Army was reduced {{to no more than}} 12,500 men. There are conflicting figures for Ottoman casualties, though {{it is clear that the}} Ottoman casualties were definitely huge, and the military hospitals of the Erzurum area were overflowed with wounded and sick. Sources do not agree on what should be included in the final sum. The Turkish official history and medical records states 23,000 KIA, 10,000 died in hospitals, 7,000 prisoners, 10,000 seriously wounded, for some 50,000 total <b>irrecoverable</b> casualties. Another estimate given by the German Commandant Larcher is 90,000 dead and 40,000â€“50,000 captured, which is often repeated in modern recountings of the battle. However, such figures are considered unreliable, both because they exceed the total strength of the entire Third Army and because the actual Chief of Staff of the Third Army (also a German), Lieutenant Colonel Guse, gave casualties as 37,000 dead and 7,000 missing based on operational returns. Artillery loses were 12 field artillery pieces and 50 mountain artillery.|$|E
25|$|On 9 September 1985 the {{district}} auditors for Lambeth and Liverpool gave notice to 81 councillors (49 from Liverpool, 32 from Lambeth) that {{the delay in}} fixing the rates was wilful misconduct {{and so they were}} required to repay the costs as a surcharge: Â£106,103 in Liverpool, Â£126,947 in Lambeth. In both cases the amount per councillor was over Â£2,000 and therefore they were also disqualified. The district auditor found that Lambeth Borough Council had been embarked, since at least September 1984, on a political campaign against the Rates Act 1984 and the Government. Since its failure to make a rate was a political lever in that battle, the failure was wilful misconduct and therefore the councillors responsible were liable for the surcharge to make good the cost of the council's actions. The surcharged councillors from both Lambeth and Liverpool appealed to the High Court against the surcharges; when the case opened on 14 January 1986, counsel for the Lambeth councillors, Lionel Read QC, argued that the cost of delaying setting a rate was a legitimate expense in an attempt to secure more money from the Government which might have succeeded. He also argued that the loss of interest was not <b>irrecoverable.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{operation}} also {{cost the}} Soviets about 1,997 tanks and SPGs. Krivosheev noted: [...] "All losses {{of arms and}} equipment are counted as <b>irrecoverable</b> losses, i.e. beyond economic repair or no longer serviceable". Initial Soviet estimates based on kill claims placed German losses at 458,080 killed and 479,298 captured, but German research puts the number of dead at approximately 92,000â€“ 100,000. The number of civilian casualties is unknown, but 125,000 are estimated to have perished during the entire operation.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} MiG-3s {{were found to}} have {{unacceptable}} performance at high altitudes despite being designed as a high-altitude interceptor. The oxygen supply was often insufficient and the stall and spin characteristics were very dangerous, especially to inexperienced pilots.

During the following months through to 30 July 1944, an additional 34,159 German personnel were lost, 5,748 of them dead and 1,179 missing in action. The total German casualties during the initial phase of the campaign was approximately 58,000 men, 12,000 of them dead or missing in action. From 24 July to 10 August 1944, the German forces buried 1709 men in Estonia. Adding the troops missing in action, the number of dead in the period is estimated at approximately 2,500. Accounting the standard ratio of 1/4 of the wounded as <b>irrecoverable</b> losses, the number of German casualties in the later period of the battle was approximately 10,000. The total German casualties during the Battle of Narva is estimated at 14,000 dead or missing and 54,000 wounded or sick.|$|E
500|$|As Madoka contemplates {{accepting}} {{the contract with}} Kyubey, she witnesses the death of Mami {{at the hands of}} a witch and realizes that a magical girl's life is filled with danger, anguish, and suffering. This is further enforced by the appearance of Kyoko Sakura, a veteran magical girl whose wish indirectly caused the death of her family. Madoka also discovers that not only do magical girls give up their souls to form their Soul Gems, the source of their magic, but when those Soul Gems become too tainted with despair, they transform into the very witches they fight against. This is exemplified when Sayaka, heavily disillusioned with the current state of the world, falls into an <b>irrecoverable</b> despair that turns her into a witch. It is then revealed that Kyubey's alien race is harvesting the emotions from magical girls to use as energy to counteract the spread of entropy. Madoka also learns that Homura is a magical girl from a different timeline who has repeated the same month countless times in order to try to save Madoka from a grisly fate.|$|E
500|$|Following {{discussions between}} the Office of Fair Trading, the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Financial Services Authority {{and the major}} banks, {{proceedings}} were issued on 27 July 2007 in a test case against the banks to determine the legality and enforceability of certain charges relating to unauthorised overdrafts. It is argued that these are contrary to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999; Schedule 2(e) of which gives a non-exhaustive list of terms which may be regarded as unfair, such as a term requiring a consumer who fails in his obligation to pay a disproportionately high sum in compensation. Penalty charges are <b>irrecoverable</b> at common law. The precedent for this was Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v New Garage and Motor Co. Ltd. [...] AC 79 along with Murray v Leisure Play [...] EWCA Civ 963, where it was held that a contractual party can only recover damages for an actual loss or liquidated losses. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group maintained that its charges were fair and enforceable and stated it intended to defend its position vigorously. On 24 April 2008, the High Court found that although these charges could not constitute penalties, they are challengeable under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. On 26 February 2009, the Court of Appeal ruled that fees for unauthorised overdrafts and bounced cheques are subject to regulation by the OFT under these rules.|$|E
