5|$|Although {{civilian}} evacuations {{had begun}} in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de Béxar, the Texian military was <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> offensive or standing firm until the smaller Gulf Coast skirmishes happened in February. Houston was now facing a choice of whether to retreat to {{a safe place to}} train his new army, or to meet the enemy head-on immediately. He was wary of trying to defend a fixed position – the debacle at the Alamo had shown that the new Texian government was unable to provide sufficient provisions or reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Among other decorations {{for their}} valour, eight cavalrymen were awarded the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest award for bravery {{in the face}} of the enemy. Three of the awards came in the first month of the war. All but one of the thirty-two British regular army cavalry regiments fought in a {{recognised}} theatre of war, <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western Front or in the Mesopotamia Campaign, during which over 5,600 cavalrymen were killed, including several senior officers.|$|E

5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50–75% {{of all cases}} of {{vertebral}} artery dissection. It tends to be located {{at the back of}} the head, <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E
5|$|Shingles, {{also known}} as herpes zoster, {{is a viral disease}} {{characterized}} by a painful skin rash with blisters in a localized area.

Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be tingling or local pain in the area.|$|E

The Vietnamese zodiac is almost identical to Chinese zodiac except the second animal is the Water Buffalo instead of the Ox, and the fourth animal is the Cat instead of the Rabbit. The Japanese have since 1873 celebrated the beginning of the new year on 1 January as per the Gregorian Calendar. The Thai zodiac begins, not at Chinese New Year, but <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first day of fifth month in the Thai lunar calendar, or during the Songkran festival (now celebrated every 13–15 April), depending on the purpose of the use.|$|E

At Bristol the aisles are {{at the same height}} as the medieval choir like some German cathedrals, and at Chichester there are two aisles {{on either side of the}} nave like some French cathedrals. At a number of the cathedrals where the transepts are large they also have aisles, <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern side as at Peterborough, Durham, Lincoln and Salisbury or both, as at Winchester, Wells, Ely and York.|$|E
5|$|AT Park is {{distinguished}} {{by having the}} San Francisco Bay beyond its right field bleachers. The body of water located adjacent to the ballpark is known as McCovey Cove, named for legendary Giants slugger Willie McCovey. McCovey Cove is known for having many fans sitting in the water in kayaks and boats hoping to retrieve a long home run ball hit there. Though dozens of fans waited in the cove during the Derby, no home runs were actually hit into the water, <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fly or off the promenade next to the right field seats, though, one foul ball hit by Prince Fielder did reach the water. This was {{largely due to the}} three left-handed competitors all exiting in the first round, as well as wind currents blowing toward left field. Prior to the All-Star break, a total of 58 home runs were hit into the cove on the fly during the park's history.|$|E
5|$|After sacking Scottish coach Graeme Souness, Benfica {{appointed}} UEFA Champions League-winning manager Jupp Heynckes. Limited by ongoing financial difficulties, {{the club}} signings consisted of players <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> books, free transfers or loans, such {{as with the}} Spaniards Chano and Tote, the former on a free deal, and the latter on loan. Tote arrived to replace Rushfeldt, who signed and practised with the team, before being recalled back by Rosenborg with disagreements over his transfer. Benfica started their campaign with a six-game winning streak in their first seven league games, topping the league until December; when a record-setting loss to Celta de Vigo, the greatest in its history, negatively affected the team mentality, causing them to drop to third place in Matchday 19, which would become their final position, finishing eight points behind Sporting, but securing {{a position in the}} upcoming season's UEFA Cup.|$|E

5|$|Any {{point that}} lies <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{production}} possibilities curve {{or to the}} left of it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly {{to the left of}} the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Han dynasty, every male commoner aged twenty-three was liable for conscription into the military. The minimum age for the military draft was reduced to twenty after Emperor Zhao's (r.87–74 BC) reign. Conscripted soldiers underwent one year of training and one year of service as non-professional soldiers. The year of training was served in one of three branches of the armed forces: infantry, cavalry or navy. The year of active service was served <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> frontier, in a king's court or under the Minister of the Guards in the capital. A small professional (paid) standing army was stationed near the capital.|$|E
5|$|Each of the 338 {{members of}} {{parliament}} in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. General elections must be called by the governor general, <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> advice of the prime minister, or if the government loses a confidence vote in the House. Constitutionally, an election may be held {{no more than five}} years after the preceding election, although the Canada Elections Act limits this to four years with a fixed election date in October. The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75. Five parties had representatives elected to the federal parliament in the 2015 election: the Liberal Party of Canada who currently form the government, the Conservative Party of Canada who are the Official Opposition, the New Democratic Party, the Bloc Québécois, and the Green Party of Canada.|$|E

5|$|Male masked shrikes sing from perches {{in their}} territories from early April, {{sometimes}} chasing or competing vocally with neighbouring males. The male's courtship display, usually accompanied by singing, {{starts with the}} bird perching erect and shivering its wings on an exposed perch, and {{is followed by the}} shrike stepping down its branch and bowing, <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> move or while temporarily halted. The male may also give a fluttering, zigzagging flight display. The female is sometimes fed by her mate while she crouches with spread wings and gives begging calls. Elements of the display are shared with other shrikes, but stepping-down and bowing on the move appear to be confined to this species.|$|E
5|$|Most Sanskrit {{works were}} commentaries <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Vedas {{or on the}} Ramayana and Mahabharata epics, written by well known figures such as Sayana and Vidyaranya that extolled {{the superiority of the}} Advaita {{philosophy}} over other rival Hindu philosophies. Other writers were famous Dvaita saints of the Udupi order such as Jayatirtha (earning the title Tikacharya for his polemicial writings), Vyasatirtha who wrote rebuttals to the Advaita philosophy and of the conclusions of earlier logicians, and Vadirajatirtha and Sripadaraya both of whom criticised the beliefs of Adi Sankara. Apart from these saints, noted Sanskrit scholars adorned the courts of the Vijayanagara kings and their feudal chiefs. Some {{members of the royal family}} were writers of merit and authored important works such as Jambavati Kalyana by King Krishnadevaraya, and Madura Vijayam by Princess Gangadevi, a daughter-in-law of King Bukka I. Also known as Veerakamparaya Charita, the book dwells on the conquest of the Madurai Sultanate by the Vijayanagara empire.|$|E
5|$|On St. Croix, waves up to 15ft (4.5m) from Omar sank about 47 boats, {{leading to}} a large oil spill around the islands. About 400 ships broke lose from the docks, 200 of which lost their anchors. Omar {{produced}} upwards of 7in (177.8mm) of rain on the island within a 24‑hour span. Although St. Croix was brushed by the eyewall, sustained winds reached 53mph (85km/h) with gusts to 72mph (116km/h). Three people needed to be rescued when their ship struck a reef and began to sink. Most of the islands 55,000 residents were without power as over 100 utility poles were destroyed. Damages on the island were estimated at $700,000 with another $1million in clean-up costs. St. Thomas, {{one of the hardest}} hit islands, was left completely without power {{in the wake of the}} hurricane. All of the major intersections were shut down as traffic lights were <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground or without power. Damages on the island totaled to $5.3million.|$|E

5|$|Prey is {{obtained}} by hunting <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground {{or in the}} trees. During the non-breeding season the fossa hunts individually, but during the breeding season hunting parties may be seen, and these may be pairs or later on mothers and young. One {{member of the group}} scales a tree and chases the lemurs from tree to tree, forcing them down to the ground where the other is easily able to capture them. The fossa is known to eviscerate its larger lemur prey, a trait that, along with its distinct scat, helps identify its kills. Long-term observations of the fossa's predation patterns on rainforest sifakas suggest that the fossa hunts in a subsection of their range until prey density is decreased, then moves on. The fossa has been reported to prey on domestic animals, such as goats and small calves, and especially chickens. Food taken in captivity includes amphibians, birds, insects, reptiles, and small- to medium-sized mammals.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Avenue Northeast {{site for}} the University District's station was {{rejected}} {{in favor of an}} option on Brooklyn Avenue. The placement of the Brooklyn station, <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north or south side of NE 45th Street, was debated by the Sound Transit Board in 2004. Seattle mayor Greg Nickels favored a station on the north side, but other boardmembers sided with community and business groups who wanted a site on the south side. The station site was further complicated the following year by Safeco's decision to expand its headquarters building {{on the west side of}} Brooklyn Avenue NE, impacting staging areas that were selected by Sound Transit. Ultimately, Safeco moved its headquarters to a downtown building in 2006, and sold the Brooklyn building to the University of Washington, and the staging areas remained available.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} uses {{multiple}} foraging techniques. Insects, {{which make up}} the majority of this bird's diet, are caught <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of the water or when they are in flight. It occasionally practices foliage gleaning. This grebe dives to catch crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When moulting at saline lakes, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimp. The black-necked grebe makes a floating cup nest on an open lake. The nest cup is covered with a disc. This nest is located both in colonies and by itself. During the breeding season, which varies depending on location, this species will lay one (sometimes two) clutch of three to four eggs. The number of eggs is sometimes larger due to conspecific brood parasitism. After a 21-day incubation period, the eggs hatch, and then the nest is deserted. After about 10 days, the parents split up the chicks between themselves. After this, the chicks become independent in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.|$|E
