That year, the chain began to struggle after competitors such as McDonald's introduced value menu offerings. After a disappointing set of quarterly earnings, Cranor left the company in January 1994. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>wake,</b> two executives with marketing backgrounds were charged with reviving the company. Roger Enrico was appointed as the CEO of PepsiCo Worldwide Restaurants, and David C. Novak was appointed President of KFC in North America.|$|E
5|$|The corps, part of Georg-Hans Reinhardt's Third Panzer Group, {{was located}} at Kalinin, 160km (100mi) {{northwest}} of Moscow. It was worn out, {{at the end}} of a long and tenuous supply line (Model had been promoted on 28 October, and needed two weeks just to get to Kalinin), and the cold weather was starting to hamper the Germans. Nevertheless, morale remained high, and the final push towards Moscow began shortly after his arrival. Model was a whirlwind of energy, touring the front and exhorting his troops to greater efforts: he also ran roughshod over the niceties of protocol and chains of command, and, in general, left his staff trailing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wake.</b> By 5 December, XLI Panzer Corps' 6th Panzer Division had reached Iohnca, just 35km (22mi) from the Kremlin. There, the advance stopped, as the winter took hold. Temperatures dropped 20 to 40°C below zero, weapons and vehicles froze solid, and the Germans were forced to call a halt to offensive operations.|$|E

6000|$|... [1] 'Marianne's Dream' was {{certainly}} copied {{from a real}} dream of somebody's, but like images come to the mystic <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>waking</b> state.|$|R
60|$|This, as {{you have}} already discerned, violates the first law of dreaming, namely, that in one's dreams one sees only what he has seen <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>waking</b> life, or {{combinations}} {{of the things he}} has seen <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>waking</b> life. But all my dreams violated this law. In my dreams I never saw ANYTHING of which I had knowledge in my waking life. My dream life and my waking life were lives apart, with not one thing in common save myself. I was the connecting link that somehow lived both lives.|$|R

25|$|The Kälvesten {{stone in}} Östergötland is dated to the 9th century.

25|$|Sheridan {{destroyed}} the Virginia Central Bridge <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wake</b> {{to prevent further}} pursuit.

"His {{dreams are}} {{a matter of}} {{indifference}} to me; for all I care his slumbers may be one long indiscretion of unsuitable erotic advances, in which the entire servants' hall may be involved.

60|$|The {{words of}} endearment, {{withheld}} so severely <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>waking</b> hours, were inexpressibly sweet to her forlorn and hungry heart. If {{it had been}} to save her weary life she would not, by moving or struggling, have {{put an end to}} the position she found herself in. Thus she lay in absolute stillness, scarcely venturing to breathe, and, wondering what he was going to do with her, suffered herself to be borne out upon the landing.|$|R

25|$|In {{a report}} of the same match, Spanish {{newspaper}} El Mundo said: Bale combines the height and build of an 800-metre runner like Steve Ovett with the acceleration and directness of a rugby winger like Bryan Habana. And, when he gets to the byline, he delivers curling crosses like a Brazilian. Big words? Yes, but that's what Bale is like – easily the greatest sensation in the opening month and a half of the Champions League. Ask Maicon what he thinks after the two exhibitions Bale turned in against Inter. Yesterday he left Maicon for dead and then a wily old fox like Lúcio was left <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wake</b> like someone trying to follow the vapour trail of an aeroplane. Three goals and two assists – against the European champions. His performances have been stunning.|$|E
25|$|Maelgwn {{eventually}} died in 547 {{from the}} plague leaving a succession crisis <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wake.</b> His son in law, Elidyr Mwynfawr of the Kingdom of Strathclyde, claimed the throne and invaded Gwynedd to displace Maelgwn's son, Rhun Hir ap Maelgwn. Elidyr {{was killed in}} the attempt but his death was then avenged by his relatives who ravaged the coast of Arfon. Rhun counter-attacked and exacted the same penalty on the lands of his foes in what is now central Scotland. The long distances these armies travelled suggests they were moving across the Irish Sea but because almost all of what is now northern England was at this point (c. 550) under Brittonic rule, it is possible his army marched to Strathclyde overland. Rhun returned to Gwynedd {{and the rest of his}} reign was far less eventful. He was succeeded by his son, Beli ap Rhun in c. 586.|$|E

50|$|This genre {{typically}} {{follows a}} structure whereby a narrator recounts his experience of falling asleep, dreaming, and waking, {{and the story}} is often an allegory. The dream, which forms {{the subject of the}} poem, is prompted by events <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>waking</b> life that are referred to early in the poem. The ‘vision’ addresses these waking concerns through the possibilities of the imaginative landscapes offered by the dream-state. In the course of the dream, the narrator, often {{with the aid of a}} guide, is offered perspectives that provide potential resolutions to <b>his</b> <b>waking</b> concerns. The poem concludes with the narrator waking, determined to record the dream - thus producing the poem. The dream-vision convention was widely used in European literature from late Latin times until the 15th century.|$|R
25|$|Sheridan {{destroyed}} the Virginia Central Bridge <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wake</b> {{to prevent further}} pursuit. After his men had rested, Sheridan brushed aside the remaining Confederate resistance {{in the area and}} marched his column to Mechanicsville. They bivouacked that night at Gaines's Mill, which was burned the following morning by some of the stragglers; Sheridan ordered a bucket brigade to douse the flames. Upon reaching Bottom's Bridge over the Chickahominy, they found it had also been damaged and rested there for the night while it was repaired. By this time, Sheridan's men were suffering from hunger and it was becoming urgent that they reach Union lines. On May 14, he led his men to Haxall's Landing on the James River, linking up with Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler's force, ending his raid. After resupplying with Butler, Sheridan's men returned to join Grant at Chesterfield Station on May 24.|$|E
25|$|Viki is {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer in 2000, but survives after a mastectomy and chemotherapy. She and Ben marry in November. In 2001, a girl named Natalie Balsom (Melissa Archer) makes the startling claim that she is Viki and Clint's biological daughter, which is confirmed by a DNA test. Mitch Laurence returns from the dead, divulging to Viki he drugged and raped her around the same time she and Clint conceived Jessica and had unknowingly become pregnant with fraternal twins, one fathered by Clint, Natalie, and the other fathered by Mitch, Jessica (Erin Torpey). Unable to reconcile the revelation, Niki Smith emerges during the ordeal and plots to kill Ben in order to have her freedom, but when Ben is accidentally shot by Antonio Vega (Kamar de los Reyes), Viki returns. Ben is left comatose after the shooting. In 2003, Victor (William Stone Mahoney) is ostensibly revealed to be alive, claiming to have faked his death in 1976; however, shortly after he returns, Victor dies — but not before Viki and Todd confront him on ills inflicted to them <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wake.</b> In 2004, Viki {{is diagnosed}} with heart disease and eventually needs a heart transplant. Coincidentally, a comatose Ben dies just as Viki takes a turn for the worse, and his heart is transplanted into Viki, who recovers but must face widowhood once again.|$|E

It was she whom he recognized first of all, whose name was on <b>his</b> lips <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>waking</b> moments. With the petulance of returning reason, he pushed his mother away. Unless Virginia was at his bedside when he awoke, his fever rose. He put his hot hand into her cool one, and it rested there sometimes for hours. Then, and only then, did he seem contented.|$|R
