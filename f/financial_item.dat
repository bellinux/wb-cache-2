40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} the concept of materiality. The most common application of materiality concerns the <b>financial</b> <b>item</b> considered. An item with a large dollar amount omitted from the financial statements is generally considered material. Size may be considered in relative terms, for example, as a percentage of the relevant base (sales, expenses, net income, total assets, etc.) rather than an absolute amount. The view that size is a special determinant of materiality means that, for financial reporting purposes, materiality can only be judged in relation to items or errors which are quantifiable in monetary terms. For decision-making, materiality is subjective because it relates to the overall impact on the response to a particular decision such as an investment or purchase. As a percentage, the resulting materiality may not be considered significant or material...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss how the mixed-accrual basis system, {{currently}} used to compute the deficit targeted by the domestic stability pact for municipalities, {{can lead to a}} different distribution of the consolidated deficit of the General Government (Amministrazione Pubblica) with respect to the adoption of a set of accounting rules mapping the mixed-accrual basis system to a system very close to the Sec 2010. In fact, the adopted rules classify some relevant items by using the cash basis, while in the mixed-accrual basis the same items are recorded by legal accrual basis. Moreover, all the <b>financial</b> <b>items</b> are excluded in the proposed classification. We then compute the deficit according to the two accounting systems, by using aggregate financial data on Italian municipalities for the period 2009 - 2011. Furthermore we investigate the role of both <b>financial</b> <b>items</b> and accounting adjustments which give rise to the differences in the two accounting systems and we analyze their distribution according to geographical area, region, population and income classes. The results show that the distribution of the municipal deficits can be very different according to the accounting system we use...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the second}} of the 4 {{discussion}} papers that, together with the Introduction and Summary paper (Miwa, 2010 c), comprise the report of my recent investigation: "A Study of Financing Behavior of Japanese Firms with Firm-Level Data from the Corporate Enterprise Quarterly Statistics - 1994 2009 ". In Miwa [2008], I used quarterly financial data on about 6, 000 firms with over 00 million in paid-in capital to question the purported success of Japanese policy toward the financial crisis and the accumulated bad loans at banks, the debate over the causes of the Lost Decade, and postwar financial regulation more generally. This paper is a follow-up to Miwa [2008]. It expands the period studied from 1994 - 2000 to 1994 - 2009, expands the focus to include much smaller firms, and redesigns the study to encompass wider issues. Taking the basic finding reported in Miwa [2010 d] into consideration, I classified firms into two groups: firms with non-zero short-term-bank-borrowing {{at the beginning of the}} term (type A), and all others (type B). Focusing on the type A firms, I control the predominant influence of zero-short-term-bank-borrowing firms, and confirm the conclusion of Miwa [2008]. In the second half of the paper, I investigate the distribution of the ratio of the amount of <b>financial</b> <b>items</b> like payables, receivables, and inventory to total assets (level variables), and the change in the amount of <b>financial</b> <b>items</b> to total assets (difference variables). Surprisingly, the distributions both in level variables and difference variables remained stable during the "Credit Crunch", the "Financial Crisis", and the "zero-interest-rate, quantity easing" monetary policy period. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{quality of}} single items was {{examined}} in several item-specific analyses, including analyses of item fit statistics, item characteristic curves, and item-total correlations. Item fit statistics {{can be calculated}} using either the maximum likelihood or model-based residuals. In ConQuest, item fit statistics are indicated as weighted mean square (wMNSQ). An ideal fit of model to data is indicated by an expected value of 1, although usually a tolerance interval is defined for values between 0.8 and 1.2 (Bond and Fox 2007). Values less than 1 indicate that the data fits the model better than expected, while values above 1 indicate an overfit. For the <b>financial</b> <b>items,</b> the wMNSQ values ranged from 0.96 to 1.06. Hence, all items fit the model.|$|R

Second, can the informational value of surveys be improved by matching interviewers and respondents based on their characteristics? Third, how does offering a "don't know " answer option affect respondent behavior? The questions are answered based on detailed survey and interviewer data from the German Socioeconomic Panel using a broad set of income and wealth outcomes. We find considerable heterogeneity in non-response across <b>financial</b> <b>items,</b> little explanatory power of interviewer-respondent matches and strong evidence that "don't know " answers result from mechanisms that differ from those yielding valid responses and outright refusals to respond...|$|R

The item discrimination value was expected to be positive for each of the items, since we expected, in view of the total score, that students with a higher knowledge level would respond more successfully to an item than students with a lower knowledge level.

30|$|The chaebol of Korea, which {{appeared}} in the 1950 s, rapidly accumulated wealth through foreign aid and government property transfers to private ownership. Under Park, who came to power in the 1960 s, the chaebol dominated the product market of Korea, assisted by heavy and chemical industry policy and an import-substitution industrialization policy. The government intensively supported the chaebol in order to raise the competitiveness of Korean corporations in the international market. Furthermore, the financial liberalization policy of the 1980 s helped the chaebol to enter the financial market. The chaebol expanded to the non-banking sector immediately, prompted by deregulation of non-bank depository institutions and the privatization of some government-owned banks. Through financial liberalization and the growth of the stock market, the fund-raising strategy of the chaebol changed from indirect to direct. This has been noted in previous research and is also found in the FOF accounts used in this analysis, which are composed of only <b>financial</b> <b>items.</b>|$|R

This paper investigates this issue and formulates and tests two suggestions, intended to keep unsophisticated users from overemphasising FVI: 1) education about the irrelevance of FVI for valuation; and 2) a two-column matrix that does not display a separate column for total comprehensive income. Participants were provided with the financial reports of two fictitious manufacturing companies, and performed valuation-relevant tasks: income prediction, risk assessment, and management evaluation. The financial reports were devised {{in such a way that}} they allowed to infer the significance participants attached to FVI. For income prediction and risk assessments, participants did not attach significance to FVI. However, for management evaluation, FVI was taken into account, however this occurred to a lesser extent when total comprehensive income was not displayed.
