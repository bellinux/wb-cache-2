500|$|I {{told him}} to mind his own business, I was tired of having the Cause {{constantly}} thrown <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> I {{did not believe that}} a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from conventions and prejudice, should demand denial of life and joy. I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to behave as a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister. If it meant that, I did not want it. [...] "I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} both archival footage—as {{well as new}} footage—of Pam and Jim's wedding {{from the}} sixth-season episode [...] "Niagara". In {{order to get a}} shot of Pam and Jim looking into the camera, Greg Daniels restaged the scene four years after [...] "Niagara" [...] had been filmed. Daniels noted, [...] "To get Jim and Pam's eye line right for the camera, I stepped in as the minister [...] so they were both looking at me with the full actor-power of all the emotions {{they were supposed to be}} feeling at their own wedding, just blasting <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> I got chills and a fever." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{concluding}} the European and Japanese legs {{of their}} tour on August 8, the band withdrew from public view. The early development of Holy Wood coincided with Manson's three-month seclusion {{at his home}} in the Hollywood Hills, during which he considered how to respond to the controversy. Manson said the maelstrom made him re-evaluate his career: [...] "There was a bit of trepidation, [...] deciding: 'Is it worth it? Are people understanding what I'm trying to say? Am I even gonna be allowed to say it?' Because I definitely had every single door shut <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face...</b> there were {{not a lot of people}} who stood behind me." [...] He told Alternative Press that he felt his safety was threatened to the point that he [...] "could be shot Mark David Chapman-style." [...] He began work on the album as a counterattack.|$|E

500|$|Hill began {{recording}} The Miseducation in late 1997 at Chung King Studios in New York City, {{and completed}} it in June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. In an interview, Hill described {{the first day}} of recording, stating: [...] "The first day in the studio I ordered every instrument I ever fell in love with: harps, strings, timpani drums, organs, clarinets. It was my idea to record it so the human element stayed in. I didn't want it to be too technically perfect." [...] Initially, Jean did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered to help as a producer, which she did not accept. Aside from doing work at Chung King Studios, Hill also recorded at Perfect Pair Studios in New Jersey, as well as Sony Studios, with some songs having different elements recorded at different studios. The bulk of the album, however, was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, the studio built by reggae musician Bob Marley. Regarding this shift in environment, Hill stated: [...] "When I started recording in New York and New Jersey, lots of people were talking to me about going different routes. I could feel people up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and I was picking up on bad vibes. I wanted a place where there was good vibes, where I was among family, and it was Tuff Gong." [...] Many members of the Marley family were present in the studio during the recording sessions, among them Julian Marley, who added guitar elements to [...] "Forgive Them Father." ...|$|E
500|$|Carpenter and {{his crew}} persuaded the city to shut off the {{electricity}} to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. [...] "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending {{on whether or not}} we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for {{about two and a half}} months I never saw daylight, which was really strange." [...] The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, [...] "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [...] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape." [...] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system. In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. [...] "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble".|$|E
2500|$|The Las Vegas Review-Journal {{reported}} that tensions reached a [...] "critical level" [...] during the standoff, [...] "with rifles pointing toward each side."

2500|$|Nevertheless, Verdi still {{refused to}} compose the music, taking the {{manuscript}} {{back to the}} impresario the next day. But Merelli would accept no refusal and he immediately stuffed the papers back into Verdi's pocket and [...] "not only threw me out of his office, but slammed the door <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and locked himself in". Verdi claims that gradually {{he worked on the}} music: [...] "This verse today, tomorrow that, here a note, there a whole phrase, and little by little the opera was written" [...] so that by the autumn of 1841 it was complete. At the very least, both Verdi's and Lessona's versions end with a complete score.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Frazier's father bought {{a black and}} white television. The family and others nearby came to watch boxing matches on it. Frazier's mother sold drinks for a quarter as they watched boxers like Sugar Ray Robinson, Rocky Marciano, Willie Pep and Rocky Graziano. One night Frazier's Uncle Israel noticed his stocky build. [...] "That boy there...that boy is gonna be another Joe Louis" [...] he remarked. The words made an {{impression}} on Joe. His classmates at school would give him a sandwich or a quarter to walk with them at final bell so that bullies would not bother them. Frazier said, [...] "Any 'scamboogah' (a disrespectful, low-down and foul person) who got <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> would soon regret it; Billie Boy could kick anybody's ass." [...] The day after his Uncle's comment, Frazier filled old burlap sack with rags, corncobs, a brick, and Spanish moss. He hung the makeshift heavybag from an oak tree in the backyard. [...] "For the next 6, 7 years, damn near every day I'd hit that heavybag for an hour at a time. I'd wrap my hands with a necktie of my Daddy's, or a stocking of my Momma's or sister's, and get to it" [...] Joe remarked.|$|E
2500|$|Ponting {{also had}} his first {{confrontation}} with Harbhajan Singh, an Indian off spinner {{who went on to}} have much success against him. In the Coca-Cola Cup series ODI against India in April, he and Mark Waugh put on more than 80 runs in 12 overs before Harbhajan was introduced into the attack. In the spinners second over, Ponting took him for four then lofted him over mid-wicket for six next ball. The following delivery saw Ponting use his feet in an attempt to get to the pitch of the ball but missed the shot and was consequently stumped. After the dismissal the pair clashed verbally. Ponting wrote, [...] "The Sharjah incident was the result of me being over-competitive but it had the potential to get quite nasty. I was really disappointed with the shot I played [...] and when I looked up Harbahjan was right <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> giving me the finger [...] and really mouthing off. Had he been a few more metres away from me I would have not reacted like I did or at the most I would have given him a bit of lip as I walked past. I just over-reacted to the provocation." [...] Both players were consequently fined ($500) and reprimanded by the match referee, with Harbhajan also suspended for a single ODI as he was adjudged to have breached the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct.|$|E

2500|$|Snowden's first {{television}} interview aired January 26, 2014, on Germany's NDR. In April 2014, {{he appeared on}} video from an undisclosed location during President Putin's live annual Q exchange with the public. Snowden asked whether Russia intercepted, stored or analyzed individuals' communications. Putin replied, [...] "Russia uses surveillance techniques for spying on individuals only with the sanction of a court order. This is our law, and therefore there is no mass surveillance in our country." [...] Benjamin Wittes in The New Republic described the exchange as [...] "a highly-scripted propaganda stunt for Vladimir Putin". Snowden insisted his question was designed to hold the Russian president accountable. In an op-ed for The Guardian, Snowden said his question was intended [...] "to mirror the now infamous exchange in US Senate intelligence committee hearings between senator Ron Wyden {{and the director of}} national intelligence, James Clapper, about whether the NSA collected records on millions of Americans, and to invite either an important concession or a clear evasion." [...] Snowden called Putin's response [...] "evasive". A few days later, The Daily Beast reported that Snowden himself [...] "instantly regretted" [...] asking Putin the [...] "softball question", which was crafted with several of his key advisers, and that he was mortified by the reaction. Ben Wizner, one of Snowden's legal advisers, told the Beast that Snowden hadn't realized how much his appearance with Putin would be seen as a Kremlin propaganda victory. [...] "I know this is hard to believe," [...] Wizner acknowledged. [...] "I know if I was just watching from afar, I'd think, 'Wow, they forced him to do this.' But it's not true. He just fucking did it." [...] Asked six months later about the incident, Snowden conceded, [...] "Yeah, that was terrible! Oh, Jesus, that blew up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> ... And in the United States, what I did appearing at that Putin press conference was not worth the price." ...|$|E
