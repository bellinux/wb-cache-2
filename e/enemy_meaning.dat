50|$|There {{is a huge}} {{roster of}} enemies all of {{different}} stats and types. Certain types of enemies can have advantages over others. For example, while all the non-white enemies have higher stats than their white counterparts, black and angel enemies have higher speeds and knockback counts, while zombie enemies can burrow past cats and can revive themselves {{a limited amount of}} times. While it now seems like the enemy has an unfair advantage, everything's fine as certain cats have advantages over certain types of enemy. For example, Weightlifter Cat is a massive damage anti-black <b>enemy,</b> <b>meaning</b> that he does massive damage against black enemies (while the damage is less for non-black enemies).|$|E

500|$|In Sanskrit texts, Khandoba {{is known}} as Martanda Bhairava or Surya, a {{combination}} of the solar deity Martanda and Shiva's fierce form Bhairava. The name [...] "Mallari" [...] or [...] "Malhari" [...] is split as [...] "Malla" [...] and [...] "ari" [...] (<b>enemy),</b> thus <b>meaning</b> [...] "enemy of the demon Malla". Malhari Mahatmya records Martanda Bhairava, pleased with the bravery of Malla, takes the name [...] "Mallari" [...] (the enemy of Malla).

Pancratius' nemesis is Corvinus, a bullying schoolmate who is irritated by the young Christian's saintliness. He does everything to bring him and the Christian community of the catacombs of Rome down. This includes the orchestrating of the lynching of their former teacher Cassianus, who is secretly Christian. Yet Pancratius shows his <b>enemy</b> the <b>meaning</b> of Christian forgiveness when he saves his life shortly after Corvinus had Cassianus killed.|$|R

This program contained musical works {{ranging from the}} mid-eighteenth to the twentieth centuries, and included text in five languages: German, Italian, French, Spanish, and English. The recital began with How Beautiful are the Feet of Them from George F. Handel's (1695 - 1759) oratorio, The Messiah. The text for this air is taken from the Old Testament of the Bible: Romans, chapter ten, verse fifteen. The second air presented {{in the first section}} is taken from Part Two of the oratorio Israel in Egypt, also by Handel. Thou didst blow describes Israel???s victory, and rejoices in the downfall of their <b>enemy.</b> The <b>meaning</b> of the phrase, 'They sank as lead', is created by a series of descending intervals. The text is from chapter fifteen of the book of Exodus, with additions from psalms. These are the only two oratorios by Handel whose words are taken exclusively from the Bible.

5000|$|When {{it became}} clear that Germany would {{experience}} a war on two fronts and that Britain would enter the war if Germany attacked France through neutral Belgium, the panic-stricken Wilhelm attempted to redirect the main attack against Russia. When Helmuth von Moltke (the younger) (who had chosen the old plan from 1905, made by General von Schlieffen for the possibility of German war on two fronts) told him that this was impossible, Wilhelm said: [...] "Your uncle would have given me a different answer!" [...] Wilhelm is also reported to have said, [...] "To think that George and Nicky should have played me false! If my grandmother had been alive, she would never have allowed it." [...] In the original Schlieffen plan, Germany would attack the (supposed) weaker <b>enemy</b> first, <b>meaning</b> France. The plan supposed that it would take a long time before Russia was ready for war. Defeating France had been easy for Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. At the 1914 border between France and Germany, an attack at this more southern part of France could be stopped by the French fortress along the border. However, Wilhelm II stopped any invasion of the Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|Carentan, the {{crossroad}} town linking Utah and Omaha beaches is {{the next}} designated target for the 502nd. On D-Day+4, Baker links up with Cole to secure a causeway leading to Carentan, engaging several German soldiers in the process. Stuka dive bombers make crossing one of the bridges incredibly risky, one bomb being able to knock Baker unconscious. Baker comes too the next day, {{only to find out}} that Private Desola was killed inches from him. Cole leads an attack on a heavily defended German farmhouse, using smoke barrages to conceal themselves from the numerous machine gun emplacements. The charge is successful, Mac {{going so far as to}} congratulate Baker for a fine execution of command under pressing circumstances. Two hours pass after the charge, and the men of the 502nd are weary and exhausted. Hopes to earn rest are soon dashed, as the farmhouse comes under attack by German forces. To make matters worse, a detachment of troops has been pinned down by the <b>enemy</b> advance, <b>meaning</b> defending the farmhouse for those that remain will be even harder whilst Baker is sent with Hartsock, Obrieski and Zanovich to the rescue of Lt. Combs. Returning with Combs, Baker and his team takes up defensive positions around the farmhouse as swarms of German infantry attack. The attack is heavy, but Baker and the rest of the 502nd manage to repel the attack.|$|R
2500|$|Another new {{gameplay}} aspect in The Godfather II is {{the squad}} mechanic, whereby the player can directly command {{a group of}} made men. Each made man has one or more special skills; [...] "Arsonist" [...] (can set fire to various locations), [...] "Demolitions" [...] (can rig bombs on cars and buildings), [...] "Bruiser" [...] (can smash certain locked doors and perform stealth kills on enemies), [...] "Safecracker" [...] (can open safes and certain locked doors), [...] "Engineer" [...] (can cut through fences and deactivate communications in <b>enemy</b> businesses, <b>meaning</b> they cannot call for backup) and [...] "Medic" [...] (can revive Dominic and other made men if their health is reduced to zero during combat). When a made man is hired, they start at the lowest rank; soldato. A total of four soldato can be hired, with the player able to promote two {{to the rank of}} capo, thus leaving room to hire two more soldato. When a made man is promoted to capo, they are granted an additional special skill, and become more powerful. The player can also promote one capo to the rank of underboss, giving him another special skill and further enhancing his strength. Although the player can have a total of seven made-men working for him, only three can be active in his crew at any one time. The inactive men can be sent to guard businesses or attack rival businesses.|$|R
6000|$|The Commons {{returned}} to their place of deliberation, {{but they were not}} satisfied. They wanted something besides promises. Some were in favor of granting supplies [...] "in gratitude to his majesty for his gracious answer." [...] Others thought differently. They did not see the necessity for raising money for this foreign war. They had greater <b>enemies</b> at home (<b>meaning</b> Buckingham and popery) than they had abroad. Besides, if the king would stop his waste and extravagance in bestowing honors and rewards, there would be money enough for all necessary uses. In a word, there was much debate, but nothing done. The king, after a short time, sent a message to them urging them to come to a decision. They sent him back a declaration which showed that they did not intend to yield. Their language, however, was of the most humble character. They called him [...] "their dread sovereign," [...] and themselves [...] "his poor commons." [...] The king was displeased with them, and dissolved the Parliament. They, of course, immediately became private citizens, and dispersed to their homes.|$|R
40|$|PhD (Old Testament), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus in {{cooperation}} with Greenwich School of Theology, 2015 Psalms using the language of enmity present a challenge for Christians who wish to use these psalms as prayer. This study investigates the language of enmity in Psalms 110, 119, 129, 137, 139 and 149 as Christian prayer and beyond the normal form category of lament or complaint of the individual. An argument is proposed to understand Book V of the Psalter as an integral unit, which editors have arranged to represent the post-exilic early restoration period. The study begins with an exegesis of each psalm and seeks to determine the perceived suffering of the psalmist(s) {{at the hands of}} <b>enemies</b> and the <b>meaning</b> of the responses to these adversaries. It then moves to a limited historical survey of how commentators through Church history have perceived the suffering and responses in these psalms which use language of enmity. This historical survey is used to correct or clarify the findings in the exegesis. In the third movement of this thesis, the results of the individual exegesis and historical survey of Psalms 110, 119, 129, 137, 139 and 149 are compared in order to elucidate the meaning of the language of enmity. The findings suggest that the language of enmity represents images of judgment on a recalcitrant adversary. The psalms are also investigated as prayers and as normative scripture. The use of the language of enmity in these psalms suggests a use of language that differs from normal use. In this regard the rhetorical device of synecdoche is most helpful in explaining how the texts function. The basis for the language of enmity seems to be the unchanging nature of moral evil. The study then investigates the psalms as canonical, normative prayer in order to move towards developing a theology of God’s just dealing with people and his people in particular. In this regard the psalms are approached as prayer, regardless of the voice in which they were composed. It is suggested that the text as normative prayer allows the psalmist, God, and the pray-er to inhabit and celebrate the same sacred time and space. Of particular concern is how each psalm speaks to the issue of how God engages with moral evil and the question of what can be known about moral evil. The findings suggest that these psalms are an invaluable spiritual resource for the church and should remain unaltered in their use as Christian private and public prayer. Doctora...|$|R
