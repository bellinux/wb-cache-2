On this supposition they came about us {{in two or three}} hours' time with ten or twelve large boats, having some of them eight, some ten men in a boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on board and plundered the ship, and if they found us there, to have carried us away for slaves.|$|E

50|$|For a sailboat, {{point of}} sail affects lateral force significantly. The higher the boat {{points to the}} wind under sail, the {{stronger}} the lateral force, which requires resistance from a keel or other underwater foils, including daggerboard, centerboard, skeg and rudder. Lateral force also induces <b>heeling</b> <b>in</b> a sailboat, which requires resistance by weight of ballast from the crew or the boat itself and by {{the shape of the}} boat, especially with a catamaran. As the boat points off the wind, lateral force and the forces required to resist it become less important. On ice boats, lateral forces are countered by the lateral resistance of the blades on ice and their distance apart, which generally prevents heeling.|$|E

50|$|At equilibrium, {{the force}} from the foil and the sail {{will always be}} balanced, so capsize should be impossible, but in {{practice}} {{that is not the}} case. Since the foil's force is relative to the hull's movement through the water, and the sail's force is relative to the wind moving past the sail, sudden changes in wind speed or direction can unbalance the foil and cause <b>heeling.</b> <b>In</b> addition, a foil on the windward side presents an unstable situation, since any lifting of the foil out of the water, by mechanisms such as heeling or wave action, will result in reduced downwards force, potentially leading to capsize. A lee foil provides more stability, as loss of lift will force the foil back into the water.|$|E

40|$|AbstractUnlike {{conventional}} airplane, a WIG craft experiences {{righting moment}} and adverse yaw moment in banked turning in ground effect. Numerical simulations {{are carried out}} to study the aerodynamics of banked wing in ground effect. Configurations of rectangular wing and delta wing are considered, and performance of endplates and ailerons during banking are also studied. The study shows that righting moment increase nonlinearly with heeling angle, and endplates enhance the righting. The asymmetric aerodynamic distribution along span of wing with heeling angle introduces adverse yaw moment. <b>Heeling</b> <b>in</b> ground effect with small ground clearance increases the vertical aerodynamic force and makes WIG craft climb. Deflections of ailerons introduce lift decrease and a light pitching motion. Delta wing shows advantage in banked turning for smaller righting moment and adverse yaw moment during banking...|$|E

40|$|Background: Corpus callosum (CC) has an {{important}} role in establishing hemispheric lateralization of function. Significance of this structure which is the primary white matter commissure of the brain {{lies in the fact that}} damage to the CC during development has been found to be associated with poor neurological outcome and neuropsychological performance. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can precisely detect, localize, and evaluate damage to CC in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) patients and assist in reaching to at an accurate anatomical diagnosis, thus <b>heeling</b> <b>in</b> further management of the patient. Objectives: The objective of this study is to analyze the effect of HIE on CC morphometry by assessing various diameters of CC. Materials and Methods: Fifty-four patients with history of hypoxic-ischemic injury referred to the Department of Radiodiagnosis were included in the study. All the patients were made to undergo MRI of the brain using Siemens Symphony Magnetom 1. 5 Tesla scanner after taking informed consent for the same. The findings of MRI brain were assessed and analyzed. Data analysis was done using percentages of different diagnosis and outcomes made by MRI brain were computed and compiled. Results: In the present study, male predominance is seen, 77. 78 % patients were male and 22. 22 % were female. In the present study, maximum numbers of patients were < 1 year of age (37. 04 %). In the present study, we see that the isthmus was the most commonly affected portion of CC. Children who did not cry at birth, born with low birth weight, low Apgar score were positively correlated with severity of damage to CC. Conclusion: From the present study, it was noted that MRI is very efficient tool in evaluating morphometry of CC in HIE. Its noninvasiveness and no exposure to ionizing radiation is an added advantage. However, experience and understanding of the principles are essential for accurate diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Capsizing {{of small}} vessels, such as {{commercial}} fishing vessels, {{is a frequent}} event. This phenomenon is generally associated with the combined action of storm seas, inadequate design parameter regulations, and dangerous operational procedures. In contrast, the capsizing of large ships is rare, but does occur. For these large vessels, more strict regulations exist to ensure safe operational procedures. While the storminess of the sea cannot be controlled, the navigation procedure can. Large offshore ships tend to navigate in a path to avoid forecasted severe weather, and in cases of stormy seas they temporarily operate at safe speeds and in the direction parallel to the waves. The work presented in this thesis investigates {{the effect of the}} wind in rolling and finally capsizing a ship. For the purposes of mechanical analysis, realistic hull forms are used and fundamental issues associated with moments and forces imposed by the wind, are applied. The platforms are examined for several wind speeds that strike the ship at different angles. Both static and dynamic cases were examined. Under the assumption of general conditions, the angles of <b>heeling</b> <b>in</b> each case and the wind speeds that caused the ship to capsize are calculated. (cont.) Furthermore, a cost analysis associated with the total loss of the ship due to capsize is also reviewed. An existing worldwide database of vessel total losses, dating from 1960 to present, is used to calculate the costs per ship capsize. Some simplifications are inevitably used, because the cost implications of total ship losses have both direct and indirect portions that are difficult to quantify. In addition, the actual numbers that result from such a catastrophe are not generally available to the public and are not found in the open literature. Given these limitations, a preliminary analysis of the capsize-associated costs is performed for several types of commercial vessels. by Angelos Antonopoulos. Thesis (Nav. E. and S.
