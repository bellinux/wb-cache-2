5|$|From Seattle, SR520 crosses Lake Washington on the tolled Evergreen Point Floating Bridge; at , it is {{the longest}} {{floating}} bridge in the world. Tolls are collected electronically using the state's <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>Go</b> pass or by mail, and vary based on time of day and number of axles; the minimum <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>Go</b> toll, , is $1.25 between midnight and 5a.m., and the maximum is $4.30 during the morning and evening peak periods. The freeway reaches {{the eastern end of}} Lake Washington at Evergreen Point in northern Medina, where it travels under a lidded park and next to a median-side bus station. After an interchange and lid at 84th Avenue Northeast in Hunts Point, SR520 travels eastward around the northern edge of Clyde Hill in a north-facing arc, passing through the Yarrow Point lid and bus station. The freeway enters Bellevue, intersecting I-405 and crossing over the Eastside Rail Corridor. SR520 continues along {{the north side of the}} Bel-Red industrial area and enters the Overlake area of Redmond.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the album's singles, two EPs were released to support Bleed American. The first of these EPs, titled <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>Go</b> EP, was released on February 22, 2002 in Japan-only. The second EP, titled The Middle/A Praise Chorus Tour EP, was a tour EP released in Australia in January 2003.

25|$|Along {{with the}} {{recording}} contracts Blackwell was handing out, {{he also wanted}} to make a go-go film and soundtrack; a D.C.-based version of The Harder They Come, perhaps. The resultant film, <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>Go</b> (or Short Fuse, as it was called on video) was plagued with problems: co-director Don Letts was let go halfway through production, the film became less about the music and more about drugs and violence, {{and despite the fact that}} most of the post-production was completed in the fall of 1985, the film was held for release until late-summer 1986. When it did poorly on release, it seemed that go-go had missed its best chance to break into the mainstream.|$|E

25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E
500|$|Another re-introduction {{involved}} the storyline surrounding the Siege of Riverrun, with actor Clive Russell {{returning to the}} show as Brynden [...] "the Blackfish" [...] Tully, who last appeared since the third-season episode [...] "The Rains of Castamere", in which the Red Wedding took place, and the Blackfish successfully evaded. In an interview with IGN, Clive Russell stated he was hopeful {{to return to the}} role saying [...] "I'd hoped that he'd come back because he comes back in the books again. But they're not doing the books -- there is no book to do it from. I'd hoped that would happen. I don't think I was surprised it would happen because they bring back all kinds of people at all kinds of times. But it was <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back there, I must say." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode, {{like the}} others in the series, was shot over eight days, with the 'May vs. May' fight being shot over three of those days—one 16-hour day, a half-day, and a quarter-day. In {{preparation}} for the fight, both Wen and her stunt double Samantha Jo had to learn both May and Agent 33's actions, with Jo explaining that [...] "Usually you only have to learn one side, so you can just drill that into your head and have that muscle memory and be <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> But for this fight, for both Ming and myself, we had to learn both sides of the fight. And we knew on the day we were filming that we’d have to be changing our wardrobe back and forth. So we’d be going {{to one side of the}} fight, to the other side of the fight, back to the other side, and we just wanted to make sure we were safe about it. Because if we spaced out and started doing the other side again, we didn’t want anyone to get hurt. So that’s why we trained together. We were doing two sessions twice a week, anywhere from two to five hours at Ming’s house just trying to get as physically ready and as mentally ready as possible. But thankfully, we’d already done so many episodes together by that point that we were super comfortable, and we know each other’s body movements." ...|$|E

2500|$|A twenty-sixth episode, Going Too Far, was {{deliberately}} created {{to be too}} violent and obscene for broadcast in Japan and was instead included as a DVD bonus.

[...] Parsons didn't dispute that each registrar was a separate legal entity, but noted that creating such entities was trivial: [...] "Mr. Linden seemed proud that the EURid registry verified that each applicant was a legal entity before it was accredited.

2500|$|The twenty-sixth episode, [...] "Going Too Far", never {{aired in}} Excel Sagas {{original}} run on TV Tokyo {{because it was}} purposefully too violent, obscene, and exactly one minute too long for broadcast in Japan. One network that did broadcast this episode, however, was Animax in Latin America. The opening sequence is altered to contain pixelated nudity and more blood, and the closing presents the translator on fours, wearing a collar, and singing the [...] "Bolero", as Menchi translates into her own language. The episode itself, in addition to much more violence, blood, and gore, includes situations containing nudity, lesbianism, apparent paedophilia, soaplands, and a love hotel—in several instances involving minors. The episode obliquely refers to the 1995 sarin gas attack on a Tokyo subway by including sarin attacks {{as a method of}} exterminating enemies.

In January 2011, she told to OnTheRedCarpet.com that she has been working on her fifth album. Da Beat Kadetz formerly known as The TriGz may be working on the project, with Manny Streetz (from Da Beat Kadetz) as executive producer. Raven revealed to Billboard that she would like to work with Sean Garrett again and that it will be R with an [...] "alternative base for lyrics".
