25|$|In 2003, Indian Navy divers {{recovered}} {{few items}} from the submarine and brought up six bloated bodies of Pakistani servicemen when they blasted {{their way into the}} submarine. All six servicemen were given military honorary burial by the Indian Navy. Items recovered were the back-up tapes of the radar computers, war logs, broken windshield, top secret files, as well as one of the bodies of a Petty Officer Mechanical Engineer (POME) who had a wheel spanner tightly grasped <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist.</b> Another sailor had in his pocket a letter written in Urdu to his fiancé.|$|E
25|$|The Bulldogs {{left the}} WWF after {{backstage}} pranks and altercations with The Rougeau Brothers {{which led to}} Jacques Rougeau knocking several of Dynamite's teeth out with a suckerpunch (Rougeau was actually carrying a bunch of quarters <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> to make the punch harder). Billington himself, however, has claimed that the Rougeau incident was not the final straw that drove {{him to leave the}} WWF. Rather, he has stated, it was a dispute with WWF management over issuing of complimentary plane tickets, over which he resigned from the company on principle and, to his surprise in retrospect, Smith followed suit.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of November 26, 1943, the Enterprise {{introduced}} the experiment in the co-operative control of Avengers and Hellcats for night fighting, when the three-plane team from the ship broke up {{a large group of}} land-based bombers attacking Task Group TG 50.2. O'Hare volunteered to lead this mission to conduct the first-ever Navy nighttime fighter attack from an aircraft carrier to intercept a large force of enemy torpedo bombers. When the call came to man the fighters, Butch O'Hare was eating. He grabbed up part of his supper <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> and started running for the ready room. He was dressed in loose marine coveralls. The night fighter unit consisting of 1 VT and 2 VF was catapulted between 17:58 and 18:01. The pilots for this flight were Butch O'Hare and Ensign Warren Andrew [...] "Andy" [...] Skon of VF-2 in F6Fs and the Squadron Commander of VT-6, LCDR John C. Phillips in a TBF1-C. The crew of the TBF torpedo plane consisted of LTJG Hazen B. Rand, a radar specialist and Alvin Kernan, A. B., AOM1/c. The 'Black Panthers', as the night fighters were dubbed, took off before dusk and flew out into the incoming mass of Japanese planes.|$|E

6000|$|... "I have counted it," [...] replied Jack. [...] "If Avatea {{consents}} {{to run the}} risk, {{most certainly}} I will; and so will my comrades also. Besides," [...] added Jack, looking seriously into the teacher's face, [...] "your Bible--our Bible--tells of ONE who delivers those who call on Him {{in the time of}} trouble; who holds the winds <b>in</b> <b>His</b> <b>fists,</b> and the waters in the hollow of His hand." ...|$|R

50|$|Asahina's name is {{associated}} with some incredible feats. According to the Azuma Kagami, he and future shogun Minamoto no Yoriie, who were good friends, one day were together in Kotsubo. Yoriie said he had heard what a good swimmer Yoshihide was, and challenged him to give a demonstration of his prowess. Immediately, Asahina jumped into the sea and soon re-emerged {{with two or three}} sharks <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists.</b> Asahina is also mentioned in the Soga Monogatari as having competed for strength with Soga Goro Tokimune.|$|R

50|$|Black Lightning is able {{to shoot}} {{extremely}} powerful lightning bolts, strong enough to kill a man if he wanted to, but he usually uses the lightning to scare his enemies. When he does fire his lightning at people, he tries to stun if he can. In a pinch, he can also ionize the atmosphere, creating localized lightning storms with strikes hundreds of times per minute. He can also create quick charges of electricity <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> to give <b>his</b> punches more of a shock. With just the power to fire lightning bolts, Black Lightning would be a world-class hero, {{but he also has}} some other powers in the mix.|$|R

60|$|He {{felt the}} tension {{breaking}} up <b>in</b> him, <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> slackened, {{he was unable}} to move. He stood there looking at her, helpless <b>in</b> <b>his</b> vague collapse. For the moment she had become unreal to him. Then he saw her come to him, curiously direct and as if without movement, in a sudden flow. She put her hand to his coat.|$|R
50|$|After {{the three}} men were shot, they were quickly loaded into their Ford station wagon and transported to Burrage's Old Jolly Farm located along Highway 21, a few miles {{southwest}} of Philadelphia where an earthen dam for a farm pond was under construction. Herman Tucker, a heavy machinery operator, was at the dam waiting for the lynch mob's arrival. Earlier in the day, Burrage, Posey, and Tucker had met at Posey's gasoline station or Burrage's garage to discuss these burial details, and Tucker most likely {{was the one who}} covered up the bodies using a bulldozer that he owned. An autopsy of Andrew Goodman, showing fragments of red clay <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lungs and grasped <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists,</b> suggests he was probably buried alive alongside the already dead Chaney and Schwerner.|$|R

6000|$|They {{had reached}} the top of Hintock Lane or Street, if it could be called such where three-quarters of the road-side {{consisted}} of copse and orchard. One of the first houses to be passed was Melbury's. A light was shining from a bedroom window facing lengthwise of the lane. Winterborne glanced at it, and saw what was coming. He had withheld an answer to the doctor's inquiry to hinder his knowledge of Grace; but, as he thought to himself, [...] "who hath gathered the wind <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists?</b> who hath bound the waters in a garment?" [...] he could not hinder what was doomed to arrive, and might just as well have been outspoken. As they came up to the house, Grace's figure was distinctly visible, drawing the two white curtains together which were used here instead of blinds.|$|R

But he heard a faint moan from behind. His mother was deadly pale and dark at the mouth. Morel was dancing up to deliver another blow.|$|R
60|$|Howard {{could not}} eat much. He was {{disturbed}} by his mother's strange silence and oppression, and sickened by the long-drawn gasps with. which {{the old man}} ate his bread and milk, {{and by the way}} the boy ate. He had his knife gripped tightly <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> knuckles up, and was scooping honey upon his bread.|$|E

6000|$|The only {{incident}} that enlivened {{this period of}} stagnation was the capture of Maurie. No; the authorities didn't get him, but Clarette did. Ajo and Patsy {{had gone into the}} city one afternoon and on their return to the docks, where their launch was moored, they found a street urchin awaiting them with a soiled scrap of paper clenched fast <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist.</b> He surrendered it for a coin and Patsy found the following words scrawled in English: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You noticed that, too, did you?' said Masquerier. 'That's {{the artistic}} temperament. You {{can do a}} lot with it. And I'm Bat Masquerier,' he went on.

Here Ollyett sat straight up, for in common with the youth of that year he worshipped Miss Vidal Benzaguen of the Trefoil immensely and unreservedly. '"Is that a dressing-gown or an ulster you're supposed to be wearing?" [...] You heard that?... "And I suppose you hadn't time to brush your hair either?" [...] You heard that?... Now, you hear me!' His voice filled the coffee-room, then dropped to a whisper as dreadful as a surgeon's before an operation. He spoke for several minutes. Pallant muttered 'Hear! hear!' I saw Ollyett's eye flash--it was to Ollyett that Masquerier addressed himself chiefly,--and Woodhouse leaned forward with joined hands.|$|R
