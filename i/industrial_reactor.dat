Schmidt's research focused on various aspects of the chemistry and engineering of chemical reactions on solid surfaces. Reaction systems of recent interest are catalytic combustion processes to produce products such as syngas, olefins, and oxygenates by partial oxidation, NOx removal, and incineration by total oxidation. One topic of his research is the characterization of adsorption and reactions on well-defined single-crystal surfaces. A second research topic is steady state and transient reaction kinetics under conditions from ultrahigh vacuum to atmospheric pressure.

40|$|Here, we give a full {{account of}} a large {{collaborative}} effort toward an atomic-scale understanding of modern industrial ammonia production over ruthenium catalysts.

A complete kinetic model based on the most relevant elementary steps can be established for any given point along an <b>industrial</b> <b>reactor,</b> and the kinetic results can be integrated over the catalyst bed to determine the <b>industrial</b> <b>reactor</b> yield. We find that, given the present uncertainties, the rate of ammonia production is well-determined directly from our atomic-scale calculations.

The success of predicting the outcome of a catalytic reaction from first-principles calculations supports our point of view that, in the future, theory will be a fully integrated tool in the search {{for the next generation of}} catalysts. ...|$|E
