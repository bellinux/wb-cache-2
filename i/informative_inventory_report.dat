The report is {{compiled}} {{to accompany the}} UK’s 2015 data submission under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) and contains detailed information on annual emission estimates of air quality pollutants by source in the UK from 1990 onwards...|$|E
40|$|The National Emission Model for Agriculture (NEMA) {{is used to}} {{calculate}} emissions to air from agricultural activities in the Netherlands on a national scale. Emissions of ammonia (NH 3) and other N-compounds (NOx and N 2 O) from animal housing, manure storage, manure application and grazing are assessed using a Total Ammoniacal Nitrogen (TAN) flow model. Furthermore, emissions from application of inorganic N-fertilizer, compost and sewage sludge, cultivation of organic soils, crop residues, and ripening of crops are calculated. NEMA is also used to estimate emissions of methane (CH 4) from enteric fermentation and manure management, particulate matter (PM) from manure management and agricultural soils, and carbon dioxide (CO 2) from liming. Emissions are calculated in accordance with international guidance criteria and reported in an annual <b>Informative</b> <b>Inventory</b> <b>Report</b> (IIR; for air pollutants) and National Inventory Report (NIR; for greenhouse gases). This methodology report describes the outline and backgrounds of the emission calculations with NEM...|$|E
40|$|The Norwegian {{emission}} inventory {{is a joint}} undertaking between the Norwegian Environment Agency and Statistics Norway. Statistics Norway {{is responsible for the}} collection and development of activity data, and emission figures are derived from models operated by Statistics Norway. The Norwegian Environment Agency is responsible for the emission factors, for providing data from specific industries and sources and for considering the quality, and assuring necessary updating, of emission models like, e. g., the road traffic model and calculation of methane emissions from landfills. Emission data are used for a range of national applications and for international reporting. The Norwegian Environment Agency is responsible for the Norwegian reporting to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and to United Nations Economic Commission Europe (UN-ECE). The Norwegian Environment annually publishes reports prepared {{as a part of the}}se reportings: National Inventory Report (NIR) for UNFCCC and <b>Informative</b> <b>Inventory</b> <b>Report</b> (IIR) for UN-ECE (Norwegian Environment Agency 2014 b and 2014 a). This report documents the methodologies used in the Norwegian {{emission inventory}} of greenhouse gases (GHG), acidifying pollutants, heavy metals (HM) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The documentation will also serve as a part of the National Inventory Report submitted by Norway to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and as documentation of the reported emissions to UNECE for the pollutants restricted by CLRTAP (Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution). LULUCF (land use, land-use change and forestry) is not considered in this report, see the National Inventory Report (Norwegian Environment Agency 2014 b) for documentation on this topic. This report is the latest annually updated version. The most important changes since last year’s documentation are: - Emissions of N 2 O and NH 3 from use of sewage sludge applied on parks and green spaces, cover on landfills, used as fertiliser and other use have been included for all years since 1990 - Emissions of NMVOC and particles from handling of coal at Spitsbergen are included for the first time - The method for calculating NOx emissions from diesel engines at offshore installations has been revised Previous editions of this report included a detailed description of recalculations in the most recent emission figures. These recalculation descriptions can now only be found in the <b>Informative</b> <b>Inventory</b> <b>Report</b> (Norwegian Environment Agency 2014 a) and the National Inventory Report (Norwegian Environment Agency 2014 b). The Norwegian Emission Inventory 2014; Documentation of methodologies for estimating emissions of greenhouse gases and long-range transboundary air pollutants is available at [URL] From 1 July 2013, the Climate and Pollution Agency, which has cooperated with Statistics Norway in the preparation of the emission inventories, and the Directorate for Nature Management were merged into the Norwegian Environment Agency. The Climate and Pollution Agency was up to 2010 called The Norwegian Pollution Control Authority, abbreviated SFT.

40|$|Increase in ammonia emissions; {{whole time}} series {{adjusted}} downwards. In 2015 slightly more ammonia was emitted than in 2014 and the ceiling {{set by the}} European Union was met (128 kilotons). It was more because both cattle numbers and fertilizer use increased, whereas low emission housing systems for pigs and poultry partly countered this. Furthermore, total ammonia emissions between 1990 and 2015 have been adjusted downwards. This is because new insights have been made into the data used to calculate emissions, called emission factors. For example, from 2008 onwards, the annual amount of ammonia emitted by fertilizer use was 4 kilotons lower than previously calculated. The new insights were recommended by an international scientific review, performed {{at the request of}} the Minister for Agriculture. Emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxides and non-methane volatile organic compounds continue to decrease slightly; the Netherlands are, therefore, complying with the ceilings in this regard. Besides the substances mentioned above, the report also includes emissions of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants. The emissions of most of these substances have decreased during the 1990 - 2015 period. The downward trend may, in particular, be attributed to cleaner fuels, cleaner car engines and to emission reductions in industry. This is concluded by the <b>Informative</b> <b>Inventory</b> <b>Report</b> 2017, drawn up by RIVM and partner institutes which collaborate to annually analyse and report emission data.
