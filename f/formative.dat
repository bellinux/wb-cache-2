5|$|CTW {{conducted}} research in two ways: in-house <b>formative</b> research that informed and improved production, and independent summative evaluations {{conducted by the}} Educational Testing Service (ETS) during the show's first two seasons to measure the program's educational effectiveness. CTW researchers invented tools to measure young viewers' attention to the program. Based on these findings, the researchers compiled a body of data and the producers changed the show accordingly. The <b>formative</b> research on Sesame Street {{was the first time}} children's television viewing was studied scientifically.|$|E

50|$|Ithkuil {{words can}} be divided into just two parts of speech, <b>formatives</b> and adjuncts. <b>Formatives</b> functioned both as nouns and as verbs, {{depending}} on the morpho-semantic context. Both nominal and verbal <b>formatives</b> were inflected to one of the possible 3 stems, 3 patterns, 2 designations (formal or informal), 9 configurations, 4 affiliations, 4 perspectives, 6 extensions, 2 foci, 4 contexts, 2 essences, and 81 cases; <b>formatives</b> could also have taken on some of the 153 affixes, which further qualified into one of 9 degrees. Verbal <b>formatives</b> were additionally inflected for 7 illocutions and 7 conflations.|$|R
5000|$|Bantu {{languages}} are agglutinative [...] - [...] words are constructed by combining discrete <b>formatives</b> (a.k.a.

5|$|During these <b>formative</b> years, Chippendale and his freshman-year college roommate Matt Brinkman {{began to}} set up Fort Thunder, a disused {{warehouse}} space in the Olneyville district of Providence.

5|$|Early in its <b>formative</b> stages, Elena {{triggered}} rainshowers and thunderstorms over {{parts of}} Cuba, The Bahamas, and Hispaniola.

Both victims were male Texas residents.|$|E
50|$|These <b>formatives</b> may be classed {{generally}} into roots, stems, prefixes, concords, suffixes, verbal auxiliaries, enclitics, and proclitics.|$|R

50|$|Many aspects and tenses are {{indicated}} by multi-verbal conjugations and, {{with the exception}} of the subjectival concord, the root, and the final vowel, most of these <b>formatives</b> are not always necessary. Note that infinitives and imperatives (both of with do not have subjectival concords) may be considered separate parts of speech (nouns/gerunds and interjectives). Deficient verbs are never used with objectival concords, and the use of the other <b>formatives</b> with them is also limited.|$|R
5|$|In 2006 it was {{announced}} that a population of comets had been discovered within the asteroid belt beyond the snow line, which may have provided a source of water for Earth's oceans. According to some models, there was insufficient outgassing of water during the Earth's <b>formative</b> period to form the oceans, requiring an external source such as a cometary bombardment.|$|E

40|$|Subject markers for the first, {{second and}} third person {{singular}} in Southern Swahili dialects display morphological variation in that specific forms are chosen with different tense-aspect markers. This paper documents this variation in the different dialects and presents a distributional chart which reveals the symmetric patterns between these subject markers and their corresponding tense-aspect <b>formatives.</b> The study corroborates earlier work in the manifestation of variant morphological tense-aspect <b>formatives</b> of the regional dialects of Swahili by Mazrui (1983) ...|$|R
50|$|While the Eurasiatic {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} well received by Nostraticists and some Indo-Europeanists, it remains very controversial. Part {{of the reason for}} this is that the Eurasiatic hypothesis rests on mass comparison of lexemes, grammatical <b>formatives,</b> and vowel systems (see Greenberg 2000-2002) rather than on the prevailing view that regular sound correspondences, linked to a wide array of lexemes and grammatical <b>formatives,</b> are the only valid means to establish genetic relationship (see for instance Baldi 2002:2-19).|$|R
