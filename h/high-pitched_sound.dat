25|$|True crickets are insects of the Gryllidae, a {{cosmopolitan}} family of around 100 genera comprising some 800 species, {{belonging to the}} order Orthoptera. Crickets, like other Orthoptera (grasshoppers and katydids), are capable of producing <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound</b> by stridulation. Crickets differ from other Orthoptera in four aspects: Crickets possess three-segmented tarsi and long antennae; their tympanum {{is located at the}} base of the front tibia; and the females have long, slender ovipositors.|$|E

2500|$|... "Hmmm!" [...] – an under-the-breath, <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound</b> {{meant to}} show {{different}} emotions, including interest, excitement, frustration, or anger; {{one of his}} most-used reactions/expressions; ...|$|E
2500|$|Clicks [...] Heart clicks are short, <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sounds</b> {{that can}} be {{appreciated}} with modern non-invasive imaging techniques.|$|R
50|$|This species forages {{in small}} family groups, and unusually they {{maintain}} contact by the <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sounds</b> {{produced by the}} rubbing of hollow quills on their backs.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of newer, {{non-invasive}} imaging techniques, the origin of other, so-called adventitial sounds or heart clicks has been appreciated. These are short, <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sounds.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Rubs [...] The pericardial {{friction}} rub can {{be heard}} in pericarditis, an inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. This is a characteristic scratching, creaking, <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound</b> emanating from the rubbing of both layers of inflamed pericardium. It is the loudest in systole, but can often be heard at the beginning {{and at the end of}} diastole. It is very dependent on body position and breathing, and changes from hour to hour.|$|E
2500|$|Molecular effect: Though fog is {{essentially}} liquid water, the many droplets {{are separated by}} small air gaps. High-pitched sounds have a high frequency, which in turn means they have a short wavelength. To transmit a high frequency wave, air must {{move back and forth}} very quickly. Short-wavelength <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound</b> waves are reflected and refracted by many separated water droplets, partially cancelling and dissipating their energy (a process called [...] "damping"). In contrast, low pitched notes, with a low frequency and a long wavelength, move the air less rapidly and less often, and lose less energy to interactions with small water droplets. Low-pitched notes are less affected by fog and travel further, which is why foghorns use a low-pitched tone.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Hell Bent", the TARDIS {{gives the}} Doctor {{a brand new}} sonic {{screwdriver}}. The new screwdriver has a TARDIS-blue shaft with gold and silver highlights. The upper half is a rectangular light grid that, when switched on, has four different functions: green light with low-pitched sound, blue light with <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound,</b> green lights that pulse with a pulsing sound, and a blue light chasing pattern with a pulsing sound. The new sonic screwdriver is meant to represent the TARDIS. The Doctor first uses it in [...] "The Husbands of River Song" [...] (although he also employs the sonic sunglasses earlier in the episode). The new screwdriver has seen use in the spin-off show Class, where the Doctor increases the voltage of flood lights to expel the Shadow Kin and partially close a rift in space-time. He is shown to have working copies of every version of the Sonic Screwdriver ever seen before in a cup on his desk in [...] "The Pilot." [...] Nardole uses the Fifth Doctor's version when sealing bulkhead doors to keep out Daleks later in the episode.|$|E
50|$|Sensory Overloading: Superman's superhearing {{has been}} {{overloaded}} several times before, even {{going so far}} as to make his eardrums bleed, when <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sounds</b> were used against him in combat.|$|R
50|$|Wheezing: <b>High-pitched</b> <b>sounds</b> {{produced}} by narrowed airways. They {{are most often}} heard when a person breathes out (exhales). Wheezing and other abnormal sounds can sometimes be heard without a stethoscope.|$|R
5000|$|The pocket is {{of unknown}} function, {{and it is}} unclear if any exists. [...] However, one {{hypothesis}} is that it aids in the detection of <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sounds</b> by attenuating lower pitches, especially when the ear is angled, common for a cat when hunting.|$|R
2500|$|Rhesus macaques {{interact}} using {{a variety}} of facial expressions, vocalizations, body postures, and gestures. Perhaps the most common facial expression the macaque makes is the [...] "silent bared teeth" [...] face. This is made between individuals of different social ranks, with the lower-ranking one giving the expression to its superior. A less-dominant individual also makes a [...] "fear grimace", accompanied by a scream, to appease or redirect aggression. Another submissive behavior is the [...] "present rump", where an individual raises its tail and exposes its genitals to the dominant one. A dominant individual threatens another individual by standing quadrupedally and making a silent [...] "open mouth stare" [...] accompanied by the tail sticking straight. During movements, macaques make coos and grunts. These are also made during affiliative interactions, and approaches before grooming. When they find rare food of high quality, macaques emit warbles, harmonic arches, or chirps. When in threatening situations, macaques emit a single loud, <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound</b> called a shrill bark. Screeches, screams, squeaks, pant-threats, growls, and barks are used during aggressive interactions. Infants [...] "gecker" [...] to attract their mother's attention.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{characters}} {{sensitive to}} the Force can derive special, psychic abilities from it, such as telekinesis, mind control, and extrasensory perception. The Force is sometimes referred to in terms of [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "light" [...] sides, with villains like the Sith drawing on the dark side to act aggressively while the Jedi use the light side for defense and peace. According to Filoni, Lucas believed a character's intentions when using the Force — their [...] "willingness or will to be selfless or selfish" [...] — is what distinguishes lights and dark sides. The Force is also used by characters who are neither Jedi nor Sith, such as Leia Organa and Kylo Ren. Characters throughout the franchise use their Force powers in myriad ways, including Obi-Wan using a [...] "mind trick" [...] to undermine a stormtrooper's will, Darth Vader choking subordinates without touching them, Luke Skywalker having {{a vision of the}} future, and Kylo Ren stopping weapons fire mid-air. The Force allows [...] "ghosts" [...] of some deceased characters to interact with the living, and Obi-Wan's ghost provides Luke Skywalker with guidance at [...] "critical moments" [...] in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Film and television use of the Force is sometimes accompanied by a sound effect, such as a [...] "deep rumble" [...] associated with the dark side or a more <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound</b> associated with benevolent use.|$|E
5000|$|Squealing or shrieking is a <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound</b> of discontent, in {{response}} to pain or danger.|$|E
50|$|Over time, the {{detection}} of <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sounds</b> becomes more difficult, and speech perception is affected, particularly of sibilants and fricatives. Both ears tend to be affected. The impact of presbycusis on communication depends on both {{the severity of the}} condition and the communication partner.|$|R
40|$|Sounds (high- and low-pitched) {{have been}} shown to be implicitly {{associated}} with basic tastes (sour and bitter-see Crisinel and Spence, 2009 Neuroscience Letters 464 39 - 42). In the present study, a version of the implicit association test was used to assess the strength of the association between <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sounds</b> and names of sweet-tasting foodstuffs, and between low-pitched sounds and names of salty-tasting foodstuffs (experiment 1). A similar task, the go/no-go association task was then used to evaluate the relative strengths of these associations (experiment 2). Analysis of the sensitivity of participants' responses suggested that both sour- and sweet-tasting (names of) food items were associated with <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sounds.</b> This result highlights the existence of robust cross-modal associations between certain sounds and basic tastes...|$|R

50|$|It is {{the only}} genus of crab spider that is able to produce a <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound</b> by rubbing its mandibles together, {{resembling}} a scream.|$|E
50|$|A Formula E {{engine is}} said to be 10 {{decibels}} higher than a gas engine touring car and produces a <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound</b> that is similar to a plane taking off.|$|E
5000|$|As {{evident from}} the {{above-mentioned}} examples, hypocorisms frequently demonstrate (indirectly) a phonological linguistic universal (or tendency) for <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sounds</b> {{to be used for}} smaller creatures and objects (here as more [...] "cute" [...] or less imposing names). Higher-pitched sounds are associated with smaller creatures because smaller creatures can only make such high frequency sounds given their smaller larynxes.|$|R

25|$|Other {{potential}} sources of the sounds normally associated with tinnitus should be ruled out. For instance, two recognized sources of <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sounds</b> might be electromagnetic fields common in modern wiring and various sound signal transmissions. A common and often misdiagnosed condition that mimics tinnitus is radio frequency (RF) hearing, in which subjects have been tested and found to hear high-pitched transmission frequencies that sound similar to tinnitus.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{though the}} dolçaina {{produces}} a <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound</b> range, {{it has a}} great timbric identity thanks to its richness in harmonics. Under certain acoustic conditions, it can also sound like a soprano saxophone or a trumpet.|$|E
5000|$|Pinch {{harmonics}} or artificial harmonics, {{sometimes called}} [...] "squealies". This technique involves adding {{the edge of}} the thumb or the tip of the index finger on the picking hand to the regular picking action, resulting in a <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
5000|$|If a {{power-up}} {{is caught}} while warping {{off of a}} completed web, the increasingly <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound</b> of a woman saying [...] "Yes! Yes! Yes!" [...] is played, and the first power-up received in the next stage will be the A.I. Droid.|$|E
50|$|One {{explanation}} for the adverse reaction is that the awful sound {{is similar to the}} warning call of a primate, back in prehistoric times. However, a study using Cotton-top tamarins, New World monkeys, found that they react similarly to both <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sounds</b> similar to fingernails on chalkboard, and to amplitude-matched white noise. In contrast, humans are less averse to the white noise than to scraping.|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{many species}} of rabbits (and similar to pikas), the volcano rabbit emits very <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sounds</b> instead of thumping its {{feet on the ground}} to warn other rabbits of danger. It is crepuscular and is highly active during twilight, dawn and all times in between. Populations have been {{estimated}} to have approximately 150-200 colonies with a total population of 1,200 individuals over their entire range.|$|R
5000|$|The kèn (...) is an {{instrument}} used in traditional Vietnamese music. It has a double reed and a conical wooden body. It produces {{a powerful and}} penetrating <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound,</b> similar to the Chinese suona, the Korean taepyeongso, and the Persian/Indian shehnai.|$|E
5000|$|Described as [...] "Turkey’s {{most beloved}} {{alternative}} music purveyors" [...] Baba Zula create a unique psychedelic sound, combining Traditional Turkish instruments, electronica, reggae and dub. The core of their sound is the saz, a Turkish bouzouki-like stringed instrument with a bright, <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
50|$|Slimy Slugs {{are short}} enough to crawl under Electric Fences, {{and due to}} their thick hides they can {{withstand}} laser fire and dynamite. The best method {{to get rid of}} them is place a Sonic Blaster, which emits a <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sound</b> wave which drives them away.|$|E
50|$|Personal alarms {{are a way}} to {{practice}} passive self-defense. A personal alarm is a small, hand-held device that emits strong, loud, <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sounds</b> to deter attackers because the noise will sometimes draw the attention of passersby. Child alarms can function as locators or device alarms such as for triggering an alert when a swimming pool is in use to help prevent dangerous situations {{in addition to being}} a deterrent against would-be aggressors.|$|R
40|$|Short, <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sounds</b> (‘snaps’ or ‘clicks’) are a {{frequent}} finding upon auscultation of both symptomatic and entirely asymptomatic patients with heart disease. These sounds very frequently indicate structural {{changes in the}} valves. While these changes {{may or may not}} be of hemodynamic significance, the patient is at considerable risk of infective endocarditis in many of these disorders. Patients presenting with these sounds should, in most cases, be advised to have antibiotics prior to any dental or surgical manipulation...|$|R
2500|$|Other {{variations}} in the didgeridoo's sound {{can be made by}} adding vocalizations to the drone. Most of the vocalizations are related to sounds emitted by Australian animals, such as the dingo or the kookaburra. To produce these sounds, the players simply have to use their vocal folds to produce the sounds of the animals whilst continuing to blow air through the instrument. The results range from very <b>high-pitched</b> <b>sounds</b> to much lower guttural vibrations. [...] Adding vocalizations increases the complexity of the playing.|$|R
