25|$|However, elsewhere, {{as in the}} United States, fictitious {{telephone}} numbers are often used in films and on television to avoid disturbances by calls from viewers. For example, The United States 555 (KLondike-5) <b>exchange</b> <b>code</b> was never assigned (with limited exceptions such as 555-1212 for directory assistance). Therefore, American films and TV shows have used 555-xxxx numbers, {{in order to prevent}} a number used in such a work from being called.|$|E

2500|$|The letters did {{not relate}} to the {{exchange}} name. For example, the exchange prefix for Essendon was FU (which translated to 37 and later became the 37x [...] exchange used by the whole City of Essendon [...] ). Although Melbourne city numbers began with 6, it was only rarely, and probably by accident, that any other exchanges had matching letters. Numbers using the old alphanumeric scheme were written as ab.xxxx, for example FU 1234 (the actual train of digits sent to the phone was [...] "371234") or MW 5550 (685550). Seven-digit numbers started appearing as early as 1960, and were all numerical from the start. There were still some six-digit numbers in Melbourne as late as 1989, but by the 1990s, they all had been converted to seven-digit numbers. Footscray used 6-digit numbers in <b>exchange</b> <b>code</b> 68 until 1987, when they were changed to 687 or 689.|$|E
50|$|<b>Exchange</b> <b>codes</b> {{could not}} begin 0 or 9 {{due to the}} trunk prefix and {{emergency}} numbers, respectively.

50|$|From 1966, UK {{telephone}} dialling codes {{ceased to}} be represented with letters. In most areas this did not require any changes to the telephone codes or numbers, e.g. the Sevenoaks STD code changed from 0SE2 to its numerical equivalent 0732. However, in Director telephone {{areas such as the}} London telephone area, the changes permitted many new <b>exchange</b> <b>codes</b> to be issued that did not correspond to letters representing the geographic locations. As '1' was also available for the 'B' and 'C' digits, this allowed many more <b>exchange</b> <b>codes</b> such as 211, 219, 221 to be used. At the same time, many local <b>exchange</b> <b>codes</b> were altered in order to group them into geographic sectors (e.g. GROsvenor became 499 rather than 470) to eliminate the need for all incoming calls to be routed via central London.|$|R

40|$|MOMI (Mobile Mixins) is a {{coordination}} {{language for}} mobile processes that communicate and <b>exchange</b> object-oriented <b>code</b> in a distributed context. MOMI's key idea is structuring mobile object-oriented code by using mixin-based inheritance. Mobile code is compiled and typed locally, and can interact successfully with code present on foreign sites only if its type is subtyping-compliant {{with the type}} of what is expected by the receiving site. The key feature of the paper is the definition of this subtyping relation on classes and mixins that enables a significantly flexible, yet still simple, communication pattern. We show that communication by subtyping is type-safe in that <b>exchanged</b> <b>code</b> is merged into local code without requiring further type analysis and recompilation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Nowadays, {{security}} {{approaches and}} solutions for SOA focus mainly on messages and data, but they forget the code security (both service <b>code</b> and <b>exchanged</b> <b>code).</b> Moreover, some security aspects (e. g. validity, correctness [...] .) are usually forgotten. We state that any security approach will be incomplete if {{the security of}} both data (messages) and code (service code) is not addressed in a general sense. In this paper, we extend a previous approach about securing code in SOA. We analyze general problems related to the <b>exchange</b> of <b>code</b> and state in SOA and in the specific case of Web Services architectures. A new general model of security is presented. This model covers any aspect related to the authorship, distribution, transformation, execution and validation of both code and data...|$|R
5000|$|The RIC {{is made up}} {{primarily}} of the security's ticker symbol, optionally followed by a period and <b>exchange</b> <b>code</b> based on {{the name of the}} stock exchange using that ticker. For instance, IBM.N is a valid RIC, referring to IBM being traded on the New York Stock Exchange. IBM.L refers to the same stock trading on the London Stock Exchange. The <b>exchange</b> <b>code</b> used in the RIC is proprietary to Reuters. Exchange codes have an ISO standard, ISO 10383, which is not used by the Reuters Instrument Code, but is in common use elsewhere. Ticker symbols are often reused on different exchanges, so in many cases the same ticker symbol references different securities.|$|E

It is {{listed on the}} second tier of the Nagoya Stock <b>Exchange</b> (<b>code</b> 7475). The name stands for [...] "Active Leader with Best Information and Strategy".|$|E
50|$|To fully qualify a stock, {{both the}} ticker and the {{exchange}} or {{country of listing}} needs to be known. On many systems both must be specified to uniquely identify the security. This is often done by appending the location or <b>exchange</b> <b>code</b> to the ticker.|$|E
5000|$|In basic {{telephony}} {{there are}} two types of offices: local and foreign. A local office was assigned a specific area, and all telephone services provided to that area came from that central office. Each central office had its unique identifier. In the early days names were used, such as [...] "Jackson" [...] or [...] "Newton". The office names were changed to three-digit numerical <b>exchange</b> <b>codes</b> (NNX), prefixed to the local phone number (not the area code).|$|R
50|$|The {{transition}} to all-figure dialling occurred between 1966 and 1970 and was {{initiated by the}} General Post Office. It {{was one of the}} first in a series of changes in the organisation of British telephone numbers. In most areas the change initially only affected the presentation of area codes, but in six multiple exchange director areas such as the London telephone area, the change required the introduction of new local <b>exchange</b> <b>codes.</b> The period of parallel operation of the old and new systems ended in 1970 with the ANN: All-figure Numbers Now advertising campaign. The changes were required for the continued good operation of the telephone service, but were considered controversial at the time. They occurred because of the increase in subscriber-dialled international calls from countries which used a different mapping of letters to numbers on the rotary dial and because the number of useful exchange mnemonics that were possible under the existing system was being exhausted. The implementation of all-figure dialling and new local <b>exchange</b> <b>codes</b> in director areas allowed changes to be made to routing of calls into and out of these areas.|$|R
