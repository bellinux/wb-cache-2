40|$|For some geographers, {{the world}} has become imaginatively alive with arrays of new nonhumans. Yet how well these vocabularies {{actually}} adhere to personal practice is something which could be better explored. Recent accounts of consumption, meanwhile, are committed to closely observed contextual experience. Yet, physical things can seem somewhat subdued in these accounts. With these ideas in mind, in this paper I align a geographical embrace of material vitality and an in-depth approach to practised consumption. <b>I</b> <b>report</b> on a <b>period</b> of ethnographic work with seven garden centres in London to reconsider {{the ways in which}} contemporary urbanites encounter the items on sale there. In the London garden centre there are some different ways of approaching life and some changing cultures of control, as the rumbling agencies that certain products purvey are both openly enjoyed and nervously negated. Exploring the unease associated with this situation and its impact upon personal behaviour and physical format, I reflect, in particular, on the current experience of plants. The conclusion that follows is potentially perverse as, although we can benefit from being with life, it seems that, in certain city spaces at least, we now deal better with that which is more dead. ...|$|R

While prostitution is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, the government did not take additional measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts during the <b>reporting</b> <b>period.</b> Authorities did not consider child sex tourism to be a problem in Trinidad and Tobago during the <b>reporting</b> <b>period</b> and <b>reported</b> no prosecutions related to child sex tourism.|$|R

Two core sampling systems were operational during this <b>reporting</b> <b>period,</b> rotary mode core sample truck system No. 2 and push mode core sample truck system No. 1. The deployment of the third rotary mode core sample truck system No. 4 continued to be delayed during the <b>reporting</b> <b>period</b> due to exhauster design issues. The schedule to close the exhauster design issues had not yet been finalized {{at the end of the}} <b>reporting</b> <b>period.</b> The availability average for all core sampling systems for this period is 49 %. This is an increase compared to 37 % during the last <b>reporting</b> <b>period.</b> Sixteen tanks were core sampled during the <b>reporting</b> <b>period</b> and l 40 samples were retrieved.

50|$|The Government of Guinea-Bissau did not {{increase}} efforts to prosecute and punish trafficking offenders during the <b>reporting</b> <b>period.</b> Bissau-Guinean law does not prohibit all forms of human trafficking, though it prohibits forced labor under article 37 of the country’s penal code, which prescribes a sufficiently stringent penalty of life imprisonment. In the previous <b>reporting</b> <b>period,</b> the National Assembly drafted legislation prohibiting child trafficking, {{though it was not}} adopted before the legislature was dissolved in August 2008. Guinea-Bissau does not specifically prohibit forced prostitution. The government could use existing laws to punish trafficking cases, such as the laws against removing children, sexual exploitation, abuse, and kidnapping of children, but did not do so during the <b>reporting</b> <b>period.</b> The government neither investigated nor prosecuted human trafficking offenses during the <b>reporting</b> <b>period,</b> due largely to systemic failures that pervaded the judicial system, such as lack of institutional capacity and corruption.|$|R

50|$|Performance {{indicators}} are typically quantified, with measurable descriptors like ratio, incidence, proportion, or percentage, to demonstrate progress. When establishing progress between <b>reporting</b> <b>periods,</b> an indicator may also express measurement by using {{words such as}} the change in, or the difference to describe values for particular <b>reporting</b> <b>periods.</b> By contrast, an outcome might measure the 'number of cases correctly resolved during the time period or the percentage by which the number increased this <b>reporting</b> <b>period</b> {{as compared to the}} previous period.' Thus, if a transportation system outcome indicator measures the percentage of roads in good condition, the transportation system outcome would be that roads be in acceptable and durable condition.|$|R

40|$|To {{detect the}} {{malicious}} meters committing electricity theft {{in a neighborhood}} area smart grid, in this paper, a novel inspection algorithm, termed as the Binary-Coded Grouping-based Inspection (BCGI) algorithm, is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, each meter is identified with a unique binary-coded number. The BCGI algorithm can locate the unique malicious meter (if any) by one inspection step {{under the assumption that}} at most one meter becomes malicious in one <b>reporting</b> <b>period.</b> Furthermore, by controlling the <b>reporting</b> <b>periods</b> of meters, we could make the probability of the event that at most one meter becomes malicious in one <b>reporting</b> <b>period</b> arbitrarily close to 1 under some assumptions. We further extend the algorithm into a Generalized BCGI algorithm (G-BCGI) to deal with the case that there are two or more meters which happen to commit the theft of electricity in one <b>reporting</b> <b>period.</b> Simulation results demonstrate the inspection efficiency of the BCGI and G-BCGI algorithms...|$|R
50|$|The Government of the Slovak Republic {{demonstrated}} adequate {{law enforcement}} efforts during the <b>reporting</b> <b>period.</b> The Slovak Republic prohibits {{all forms of}} trafficking through Sections 179-181 of its criminal code, which prescribes penalties under the criminal code ranging from four to 25 years’ imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and are commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. Police conducted 14 trafficking investigations in 2007, including one labor trafficking investigation, compared to 20 investigations in 2006. The government prosecuted 16 defendants in four cases, compared to 32 trafficking cases in 2006. Seven trafficking offenders were convicted during the <b>reporting</b> <b>period,</b> down from 18 convicted in 2006. Most convicted traffickers were given sentences of up to two years’ imprisonment; one trafficker was sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment. There were no official cases of high-level government officials involved in trafficking during the <b>reporting</b> <b>period.</b> The government extradited one person to Austria to face trafficking charges during the <b>reporting</b> <b>period.</b>|$|R
