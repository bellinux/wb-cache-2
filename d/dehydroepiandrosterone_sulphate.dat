40|$|The aim. To {{study the}} {{functional}} state of adrenal cortex and thyroid gland in metabolic syndrome (MS). 186 women and 65 men were included. Blood levels of cortisol, <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate,</b> total thyroxin, total triiodothyronine, {{thyroid stimulating hormone}} were studied in subjects with and without metabolic syndrome (IDF test) and their relation with MS components. The results. 75 (29, 9 %) of the 251 examined patients had MS. In the group with MS the levels of total thyroxin and <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate</b> were decreased to 1, 90 ± 0, 18 microgram/milliliter vs. 2, 37 ± 0, 12 microgram/milliliter (р= 0, 033) in patients without MS and 2, 19 ± 0, 26 nmol/l vs. 2, 59 ± 0, 15 nmol/l (р= 0, 040), respectively. The levels of <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate</b> were inversely correlated with the systolic blood pressure (r=- 0, 23, р< 0, 001), high density lipoprotein (r=- 0, 22, p= 0, 001), triglycerides (r=- 0, 14, p= 0, 034), C-peptide (r=- 0, 44, p< 0, 001). The total thyroxin content was inversely correlated with low density lipoprotein (r=- 0, 38, р= 0, 026). The patients with low <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate</b> had higher rate of MS components. The coefficient of association between low dehydroepiandrosterone of sulphate and MS existence was + 0, 39 (р= 0, 009). There wasnt any difference between the group with MS and without {{in the level of}} morning cortisol in blood and after the 1 mg dexamethasone test. Conclusion. MS formation is associated with the reduction of the levels of <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate</b> and total thyroxin in blood, the levels of which are inversely correlated with the elements of MS. The content of <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate</b> in blood {{can be one of the}} indices of metabolic «wellbeing»...|$|E
40|$|Chronic fatigue {{syndrome}} {{is defined by}} the Atlanta Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA, USA) as debilitating fatigue lasting for longer than 6 months. Symptoms include disturbances of cognition. Certain factors have in the past been shown to influence cognition, including metals such as aluminum, iron, and zinc; and steroids such as dehydroepiandrosterone. In the present study, concentrations of these factors were determined in the serum and plasma of patients and their age- and gender-matched healthy controls (10 women and 5 men in each group). In addition, copper, <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate,</b> cortisol, cholesterol, hemoglobin, ferritin and transferrin concentrations, as well as transferrin genetic subtypes were determined in both groups. The results indicate that patients had significantly increased serum aluminum and decreased iron compared to controls.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of estrogens and androgens on hypothalamic beta-endorphin (beta-EP) concentrations. Intact or castrated female rats were chronically (2 weeks) treated with estrogen (estradiol benzoate) and/or antiestrogens (clomiphene, cyclophenil or epimestrol), and with androgens (dihydrotestosterone or <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate)</b> and/or antiandrogen (cyproterone acetate). A group of rats treated with vehicle were studied as comparison. The beta-EP concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay on acidic extracts of rat hypothalami. The administration of clomiphene and cyclophenil significantly reduced hypothalamic beta-EP concentrations in intact rats, while both drugs or estradiol benzoate increased the peptide concentration in castrated rats. Both intact and castrated rats treated with epimestrol showed hypothalamic beta-EP concentrations higher than vehicle treated rats. The estradiol-induced increase of beta-EP was not changed by the concomitant administration of antiestrogens. The administration of dihydrotestosterone significantly decreased beta-EP concentrations in both intact and castrated female rats, while the treatment with <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate</b> only slightly decreased beta-EP levels in intact female rats. The cyproterone acetate-chronically treated rats showed higher beta-EP concentrations than vehicle-treated rats and these changes were reversed by the concomitant addition of dihydrotestosterone or <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate.</b> These results showed that estrogens play a positive role while androgens negatively influence the hypothalamic beta-EP concentrations in female rats, supporting the view that central beta-EP might be a target of gonadal steroid feedback signals...|$|E

40|$|The sigma 1 (σ 1) {{receptor}} cDNA was cloned {{in several}} animal species. Molecular tools {{are now available}} to identify its endogenous effectors, such as neuroactive steroids, and to establish its precise physiological role. In particular, the σ 1 receptor is involved in memory processes, as observed in pharmacological and pathological rodent models of amnesia. In order to establish the involvement of σ 1 receptors in memory, a 16 -mer oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to the σ 1 receptor cDNA (aODN), and its mismatched control (mODN) were prepared and centrally administered into the mouse brain. The anti-amnesic effects induced by the selective σ 1 agonist PRE- 084 and the steroid <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA) <b>sulphate</b> or pregnenolone sulphate were examined in ODN-treated animals. The aODN treatment failed to affect the dissociation constant (Kd) but significantly decreased the number of σ 1 sites (Bmax) labelled with [3 H]-(+) -SKF- 10, 047 in the hippocampus and cortex. In these structures, the in vivo binding levels were also diminished, according to the dose and number of injections, as compared with control animals injected with saline or mODN. Cannulation and injections failed to affect the open-field behaviour of the animals. However, the anti-amnesic effects of PRE- 084 and DHEA sulphate against the dizocilpine-induced impairments were blocked after aODN treatment in the short- and long-term memory tests. The anti-amnesic effects of pregnenolone sulphate remained unchanged. These observations bring a molecular basis to the modulatory role of σ 1 receptors in memory, and reveal that the anti-amnesic action of neuroactive steroids may not similarly involve an interaction with σ 1 receptors...|$|R

Some serum parameters like liver and kidney functions were detected. Biochemical analysis showed that there is a significant increase of total lipids, cholestrol, triglycerides. But insignificant change in serum glucose, urea nitrogen and uric acid levels were recorded. From the present study three things were concluded. Firstly, there is a strong relationship between level of DHEA and the progression of SLE. Secondly, liver activity and kidney functions were not affected by SLE disease.

40|$|Abstract Background Malaria {{transmission}} is now {{recognized as a}} key target for intervention. Evaluation of the Plasmodium oocyst burden in the midguts of Anopheles spp. is important for many of assays investigating transmission. However, current assays are very time-consuming, manually demanding and patently subject to observer-observer variation. Methods This report presents {{the development of a}} method to rapidly, accurately and consistently determine oocyst burdens on mosquito midguts using GFP-expressing Plasmodium berghei and a custom-written macro for ImageJ. The counting macro was optimized and found to be fit-for-purpose by performing gametocyte membrane feeds with parasite infected blood. Dissected midguts were counted both manually and using the automated macro, then compared. The optimized settings for the macro were then validated by using it to determine the transmission blocking efficacies of two anti-malarial compounds - <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate</b> and lumefantrine, in comparison to manually determined analysis of the same experiment. Results Concurrence of manual and macro counts was very high (R 2 = 0. 973) and reproducible. Estimated transmission blocking efficacies between manual and automated analysis were highly concordant, indicating that <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate</b> has little or no transmission blocking potential, whilst lumefantrine strongly inhibits sporogony. Conclusion Recognizing a potential five-fold increase in throughput, the resulting reduction in personnel costs, and the absence of inter-operator/laboratory variation possible with this approach, this counting macro may be a benefit to the malaria community. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and {{vascular}} dementia (VAD) {{are the major}} forms of dementia affecting elderly people, in which the levels of many metabolites are altered in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum. These metabolites could be risk factors or potential biomarkers, but the significance {{of some of these}} are not clearly understood {{in the context of the}} disease pathogenesis. In the present study serum levels of homocysteine, <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate</b> (DHEA-S) and lipoprotein (a) or Lp(a) have been measured by ELISA using commercial kits in AD (n = 40), VAD (n = 40) and age matched control subjects (n = 40). The data are compared by ANOVA and post-hoc analysis. The serum homocysteine is markedly elevated compared to control both in AD and VAD subjects, but to a significantly higher extent in the latter. Lp(a) is increased in the serum of VAD subjects only compared to control. Likewise, serum DHEA-S level is lowered in AD but not in VAD compared to control. The analysis of the present data and those published by others suggest that alterations in homocysteine and Lp(a) in serum are indicators of vascular pathology in AD or VAD, while the lowering of serum DHEA-S is a consequence of AD pathology.

40|$|The {{output of}} estrogens, {{testosterone}} and their precursors was {{compared with that}} of glucocorticosteroids under standardized conditions, in a suspension of isolated human adrenal cells. Cortisol, corticosterone, androstenedione, <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> and its <b>sulphate</b> all increased in the same proportions after ACTH stimulation. The response to the logarithm of ACTH concentrations had a sigmoid shape but was fairly linear between 5 and 100 to 1000 μu. /ml. The output of dehydroepiandrosterone plus that of its sulphate was of the same order of magnitude as the production of cortisol; the output of free dehydroepiandrosterone averaged half that of the sulphate indicating that the adrenal cortex is capable, under certain conditions, of producing large amounts of the free steroid. The output of androstenedione was very low, on average 35 times lower than that of cortisol, suggesting by extrapolation that the adrenal secretion may not be the main source of androstenedione in vivo or that ACTH is not the unique stimulus to adrenal androstenedione secretion. The output of testosterone was small to negligible and that of estrogens was practically absent. In three additional experiments the influence of prolactin, prostaglandins, FSH and HCG was explored: no selective stimulation of androgen or estrogen output was observed except in one experiment in which HCG stimulated adrenal testosterone production.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Fatigue {{is one of}} the most limiting symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS) and the mechanisms underlying its origin are poorly understood. Our aim was to test whether fatigue in MS is associated with endocrine markers. Methods We longitudinally studied 73 progressive MS patients. Fatigue was assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Given the longitudinal design of our study, patients were labelled as sustained fatigued when FSS scores were / 5. 0 at all time points, and as non-fatigued when FSS scores were 5 / 5. 0 at all time points. Serum levels of <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA), its <b>sulphated</b> conjugate (DHEAS) and cortisol were measured at each time point. Results Twenty-nine patients scored / 5. 0 in the FSS at all time points, and 9 patients (12. 3 %) scored 5 / 5. 0 at all time points. Mean baseline levels of DHEAS and DHEA were lower in MS patients with sustained fatigue when compared to patients without fatigue (P/ 0. 01 and P/ 0. 03 respectively). Analysis of DHEAS and DHEA over time showed significantly lower hormone levels in patients with fatigue [F(1, 31) / 6. 14, P/ 0. 019 for DHEAS; F(1, 32) / 6. 63, P/ 0. 015 for DHEA]. Conclusions Fatigue in progressive MS could be related to low serum levels of DHEA and DHEAS.

40|$|Human adrenarche is {{associated}} with the establishment of a functional zona reticularis (ZR) and increasing secretion of <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA) in <b>sulphated</b> form (DS). Like most non-human primates, rhesus macaques are not believed to undergo adrenarche, though they clearly establish a functional ZR after birth. However, the origins of the rhesus ZR are not well defined. Therefore, we investigated the zonal development, steroidogenic enzyme expression and morphology of rhesus adrenals from 20 1 day to 14 months of age. Immuno-histochemistry was conducted to determine expression profiles of the steroidogenic enzymes 17 α-hydroxylase/ 17, 20 -lyase cytochrome P 450 (P 450 c 17), 21 -hydroxylase cytochrome P 450 (P 450 c 21), 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/∆ 5 - 4 isomerase (3 β-HSD), the redox partner NADPH-cytochrome P 450 oxidoreductase (CPR), as well as the accessory protein cytochrome b 5 (b 5), a marker of the primate ZR. The rhesus ZR is mature by 3 months of age based on differentiation of the innermost zone which lacks 3 β-HSD, but exhibits increased b 5 expression during this period. Further, the ZR develops in neonates from a previously described dense band of cells which we show expresses b 5, P 450 c 17, CPR, and P 450 c 21 throughout maturation. The fetal zone (FZ) is distinguished from the ZR by its lack of 30 P 450 c 21, and ZR development proceeded as the FZ regressed with two important implications: neither FZ regression nor ZR maturation can be monitored independently by circulating adrenal androgens, and these events must be induced by different factors in rhesus, and likely humans.

Methods: Data from 502 women and 425 men from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-TREND) were used. Cross-sectional associations of sex hormones including testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (FT), <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate</b> (DHEAS), androstenedione (ASD), estrone (E 1) and SHBG with quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters at the heel, including broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), speed of sound (SOS) and stiffness index (SI) were examined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariable quantile regression models. Results: Multivariable regression analysis showed a sex-specific inverse association of DHEAS with SI in men (Beta per SI unit = − 3. 08, standard error (SE)  =  0. 88), but not in women (Beta = − 0. 01, SE =  2. 09). Furthermore, FT was positively associated with BUA in men (Beta per BUA unit =  29. 0, SE =  10. 1). None of the other sex hormones (ASD, E 1) or SHBG was associated with QUS parameters after multivariable adjustment. Conclusions: This cross-sectional population-based study revealed independent associations of DHEAS and FT with QUS parameters in men, suggesting a potential influence on male bone metabolism. The predictive role of DHEAS and FT as a marker for osteoporosis in men warrants further investigation in clinical trials and large-scale observational studies...|$|E

Estimated transmission blocking efficacies between manual and automated analysis were highly concordant, indicating that <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate</b> has little or no transmission blocking potential, whilst lumefantrine strongly inhibits sporogony. Conclusion. Recognizing a potential five-fold increase in throughput, the resulting reduction in personnel costs, and the absence of inter-operator/laboratory variation possible with this approach, this counting macro may be a benefit to the malaria community. © 2010 Delves and Sinden; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-throughput}} assay {{utilizing the}} voltage/ion probe reader (VIPR) technology identified salicylidene salicylhydrazide (SCS) {{as being a}} potent selective inhibitor of α 2 β 1 γ 1 θ GABAA receptors with a maximum inhibition of 56 ± 5 % and an IC 50 of 32 (23, 45) [*]nM. Evaluation of this compound using patch-clamp electrophysiological techniques demonstrated that the compound behaved in a manner selective for receptors containing the β 1 subunit (e. g. maximum inhibition of 68. 1 ± 2. 7 % and IC 50 value of 5. 3 (4. 4, 6. 5) nM on α 2 β 1 γ 1 receptors). The presence of a β 1 subunit was paramount for the inhibition with changes between α 1 and α 2, γ 1 and γ 2, {{and the presence of}} a θ subunit having little effect. On all subtypes, SCS produced incomplete inhibition with the greatest level of inhibition at α 1 β 1 γ 1 θ receptors (74. 3 ± 1. 4 %). SCS displayed no use or voltage dependence, suggesting that it does not bind within the channel region. Concentration – response curves to GABA in the presence of SCS revealed a reduction in the maximum response with no change in the EC 50 or Hill coefficient. In addition, SCS inhibited pentobarbitone-induced currents. Threonine 255, located within transmembrane domain (TM) 1, and isoleucine 308, located extracellularly just prior to TM 3, were required for inhibition by SCS. SCS did not compete with the known allosteric modulators, picrotoxin, pregnenolone <b>sulphate,</b> <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> 3 -sulphate, bicuculline, loreclezole or mefenamic acid. Neither was the inhibition by SCS influenced by the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil. In conclusion, SCS is unique in selectively inhibiting GABAA receptors containing the β 1 subunit via an allosteric mechanism. The importance of threonine 255 and isoleucine 308 within the β 1 subunit and the lack of interaction with a range of GABAA receptor modulators suggests that SCS is interacting at a previously unidentified site...|$|R
40|$|Organ-specific {{autoimmunity}} {{constitutes a}} large health problem, where both the clinical management and {{our understanding of}} the pathogenetic mechanisms need to improve. Women with Addison's disease have abnormally low levels of <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA), its <b>sulphate</b> ester (DHEA-S) and androgens relative to age, and many patients complain of physical and mental fatigue and low stress tolerance. To define a suitable dose, the effect of oral DHEA replacement was evaluated in women with Addison's disease. DHEA was administered for three months to nine women with Addison's disease in either of two doses, 50 mg (n= 5) or 200 mg (n= 4). A dose of 50 mg restored the DHEA(S) and androgen levels to normal without altering the insulin sensitivity, body composition or serum lipid profile. Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I (APS I) is a rare but useful model disorder of autoimmunity, characterised by multiple organ-specific autoimmune manifestations and high-titre autoantibodies and with adrenocortical insufficiency, Addison's disease, as one of its cardinal manifestations. Approximately 10 - 20 % of APS I patients suffer from autoimmune hepatitis, which carries a high mortality, if untreated. The presence of putative antigenic targets in the liver was investigated. Cytochrome P 4501 A 2 (CYP 1 A 2) and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) were identified as hepatic autoantigens with the use of APS I sera for immunofluorescent staining of normal human liver, Western blot of microsomal and cytosol fractions of human liver homogenate, and immunoprecipitation of in vitro transcribed and translated radioactively labelled proteins. The presence of CYP 1 A 2 - and AADC-antibodies was significantly correlated to AIH, and CYP 1 A 2 antibodies inhibited enzyme activity in vitro. In conclusion, a daily replacement dose of 50 mg of DHEA sufficiently restores levels of DHEA, DHEA(S) and androgens in women with Addison's disease, without severe side-effects. We have further identified CYP 1 A 2 and AADC as hepatic autoantigens associated with autoimmune hepatitis in APS I...|$|R
40|$|Background: Long-term psychosocial {{stress can}} cause and {{contribute}} {{to a wide range}} of psychological and somatic conditions, and accelerate aging. One of the consequences of long-term psychosocial stress may be a reduction in the levels of <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> and its <b>sulphated</b> metabolite <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> sulfate (DHEA-S). The aim of this thesis was to investigate the effects of acute and long-term psychosocial stress on serum levels of DHEA and DHEA-S in otherwise healthy men and women. Method: In Paper I, 39 healthy individuals went through a stress test (Trier social stress test). Blood samples were collected before the stress test, immediately after the stress test and after 30 minutes of recovery. Mixed between-within ANOVAs were used to investigate the responses of DHEA and DHEA-S. Thirty-six of the 39 participants in Paper I answered a questionnaire regarding long-term stress (perceived stress at work) and were included in Paper II. DHEA and DHEA-S response during acute stress were compared between groups of individuals who reporting different levels of long-term stress (Low, Medium, High) using ANCOVA. The Low stress group, which did not experience any stress at work, was used as reference group. In Paper III, morning DHEA-S and DHEA levels were measured in serum in 41 stressed and 40 non-stressed individuals. The groups were defined based on their scores on the questionnaire measuring long-term stress (perceived stress at work). DHEA and DHEA-S levels were compared between the groups using ANCOVA. Results: While acute psychosocial stress increases the levels of DHEA and DHEA-S temporarily (Paper I), long-term psychosocial stress is associated with reduced capacity to produce DHEA-S during acute stress (Paper II) and lower basal DHEA-S levels (Paper III). Conclusions: Considering the beneficial effects that DHEA and DHEA-S have and the fact that low DHEA and DHEA-S levels are associated with adverse health, the findings of this thesis suggest that one of the links between long-term stress and adverse health could be that long-term stress reduces the capacity to produce DHEA-S...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Studies {{relating}} long-term {{exposure to}} persistent organochlorine pollutants (POPs) with endocrine activities (endocrine disrupting chemicals) on circulating levels of steroid hormones {{have been limited}} to {{a small number of}} hormones and reported conflicting results. Objective: We examined the relationship between serum concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone, <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate,</b> androstenedione, androstenediol, testosterone, free and bioavailable testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estrone, estrone sulphate, estradiol, sex-hormone binding globulin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone as a function of level of exposure to three POPs known to interfere with hormone-regulated processes in different way: dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene (DDE), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener 153, and chlordecone. Methods: We collected fasting, morning serum samples from 277 healthy, non obese, middle-aged men from the French West Indies. Steroid hormones were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, except for <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> <b>sulphate,</b> which was determined by immunological assay, as were the concentrations of sex-hormone binding globulin, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. Associations were assessed by multiple linear regression analysis, controlling for confounding factors, in a backward elimination procedure, in multiple bootstrap samples. Results: DDE exposure was negatively associated to dihydrotestosterone level and positively associated to luteinizing hormone level. PCB 153 was positively associated to androstenedione and estrone levels. No association was found for chlordecone. Conclusions: These results suggested that the endocrine response pattern, estimated by determining blood levels of steroid hormones, varies depending on the POPs studied, possibly reflecting differences in the modes of action generally attributed to these compounds. It remains to be investigated whether this response pattern is predictive of the subsequent occurrence of disease. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Background. Steroidogenesis is {{a complex}} enzymatic pro- cess in which cyclic {{adenosine}} monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) play an important role. Phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitors(PDE 5 i) increase cGMP, improving NO availability. Objective. To investigate whether long-term, chronic treat- ment with the PDE 5 i Vardenafil affects adrenal and testicular steroidogenesis in diabetic men, using liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Design. A longitudinal, prospective, investigator-started, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical-trial was carried out. Setting and participants. 54 male patients affected by T 2 DM diagnosed within the last 5 years were enrolled. 26 and 28 patients {{were assigned to the}} verum and placebo-group, re- spectively. Interventions. The study consisted of an enrolment phase, a treatment phase (24 weeks) (Vardenafil/placebo 10 mg twice- daily), and a follow-up phase (24 weeks). Outcome measurements. Progesterone (P), 17 -hydroxy- progesterone (17 OHP), androstenedione (A), testosterone (T), <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA), DHEA <b>sulphate</b> (DHEAS), corticosterone, 11 -deoxycortisol and cortisol (C), were evalu- ated using LC-MS/MS. Results. No differences were seen in sex testicular steroids between study and control group. For the adrenal gland, steroids were considered according to the zona in which they are pro- duced. Considering steroids produced in the zona fasciculata, no significant differences were seen in 11 -deoxycortisol and C among visits, both in the study and in the control group. For the zona reticularis, DHEA significantly decreased during treatment only in the study group (p= 0. 007). At post-hoc test DHEA showed higher levels at visit 2 and 8 than in other visits. The DHEAS/DHEAS ratio significantly increased during treatment only in the verum group. Considering the adrenal zona glomeru- losa, corticosterone significantly changed among visits both in the study and in the control group (p< 0. 001). At post-hoc test, in ПРОБЛЕМЫ ЭНДОКРИНОЛОГИИ, 5, 2016 both groups, corticosterone was significantly higher at visit 2 (p= 0. 028), 8 (p= 0. 003) and 10 (p= 0. 044), i. e. in coincidence with the complete clinical and instrumental examination per- formed only at these visits according to the study protocol. Conclusions. This is the first double-blind, placebo-con- trolled clinical-trial in which steroidogenesis is extensively in- vestigated by LC-MS/MS in T 2 DM men chronically treated with Vardenafil for 6 months, and followed-up for 6 months after therapy-withdrawal. Chronically administered Vardenafil reduces DHEA levels and increases DHEAS/DHEA ratio as possible consequences of modulation of steroidogenic enzymes by tissue changes in cGMP and/or cAMP availability. A possi- bly stress-related increase in corticosterone is suggested for the first time...|$|R
40|$|Steroid hormones have {{a pivotal}} role in many {{physiological}} processes. For example, the glucocorticoids are crucial in the regulation and maintenance of sugar balance, immunity, stress response, and mood, whereas the mineralocorticoids are involved in electrolyte- and water balance thus regulating blood pressure. Androgens are crucial for muscle function, cardiovascular system and the development and maintenance of male characteristics. Therefore, the disruption of the steroidogenesis is associated with severe diseases such as cancer, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, immune disorders, impaired brain function, and developmental dysfunctions. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we were interested in the in vitro investigation of xenobiotics affecting the human steroidogenesis. We focused on the adrenal steroidogenesis, which is rather neglected by many regulatory agencies, despite its pivotal role in humans. We provided a critical overview of the current available cell lines used to screen for potential endocrine disruptors and to study their effects on adrenal steroidogenesis. Moreover, we discussed their advantages/disadvantages, and the need for improvements of the well-established human carcinoma cell line H 295 R and the associated validated OECD test guideline 456, namely the “H 295 R steroidogenesis assay”. This resulted in a refined version of the H 295 R steroidogenesis assay, which is distinguished from the currently used OECD protocols by analyzing multiple adrenal steroids simultaneously with exclusive separation techniques combined with mass spectrometry, as well as including additional controls, such as medium composition at the starting time and reference compounds with known mechanism. The obtained results of the steroid changes can then be further combined with the observed effects on gene expression, providing first mechanistic hints on steroidogenesis disruption. By using the newly established refined version of the H 295 R steroidogenesis assay, we demonstrated that exposure of H 295 R cells to the UV-filter octyl methoxycinnamate and the plasticizer acetyl tributylcitrate resulted in increased corticosteroid levels, as well as enhanced CYP 11 B 2 expression, similar to the corticosteroid inducer torcetrapib (positive control). To summarize, the refined H 295 R steroidogenesis assay is a valuable in vitro tool to screen and study chemicals potentially disrupting the production of adrenal steroids and provides initial mechanistic evidence in combination with gene expression data. Many psychoactive drugs can lead to immense increases in cortisol by stimulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, a comprehensive analysis of drug induced changes of several steroids, such as glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and adrenal androgens along with their full time courses is missing. In the second part of this thesis, we studied the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), which has sparked a renewed interest in psychiatric research, lisdexamfetamine, a new drug for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and D-amphetamine on the circulating steroids in vivo. Plasma samples were obtained from two individual clinical trials, where healthy volunteers were administered a single dose of either LSD (200 µg), lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (100 mg) or immediate-release D-amphetamine sulfate (40. 3 mg) at equimolar doses. Both studies were conducted using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design and plasma steroids for the concentration–time profiles were quantified by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). We could demonstrate, that LSD produces significant acute effects on circulating steroids compared to placebo in 16 healthy volunteers. The glucocorticoids cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone and 11 -dehydrocorticosterone were significantly increased following LSD administration, indicating HPA axis stimulation. Cortisol and corticosterone reached the maximum concentration (cmax) after 2. 5 h and 1. 9 h of LSD administration, respectively. Evaluation of the relationship between the LSD concentration in plasma and the glucocorticoid response to LSD indicated no acute pharmacological tolerance. Furthermore, the androgens dehydroepiandrosterone (cmax and the area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 10 h (AUC 10)) and androstenedione (AUC 10) were significantly increased by LSD, but not the other androgens, mineralocorticoids or progestogens compared to placebo. We showed, that the administration of equivalent doses of lisdexamfetamine and D-amphetamine exhibit an identical pharmacokinetic profile for plasma D-amphetamine. However, lisdexamfetamine administration showed a significantly longer onset time (1. 4 vs. 0. 8 h) and tmax (4. 4 vs. 3. 2 h) for plasma D-amphetamine compared to D-amphetamine administration, due to the rate-limiting hydrolysis of lisdexamfetamine. Furthermore, lisdexamfetamine and D-amphetamine showed a similar enhancement of glucocorticoid production (cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone, 11 -dehydrocorticosterone, and 11 -deoxycortisol), increases in androgen precursors (<b>dehydroepiandrosterone,</b> its <b>sulphated</b> metabolite, and androstenedione) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in plasma in 24 healthy volunteers. This suggests a HPA axis stimulation. Moreover, an acute pharmacological tolerance of the drug-induced change in active glucocorticoids was demonstrated. The other circulating steroids, such as the mineralocorticoids (aldosterone and 11 -deoxycorticosteone), androgens (testosterone and androsterone) and progestins (17 α-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone (but not the male progesterone levels)), were not affected by lisdexamfetamine or D-amphetamine. In conclusion, LSD, lisdexamfetamine and D-amphetamine had an acute and profound effect on the circulating steroids, especially on the glucocorticoids, suggesting HPA stimulation. This emphasizes the need for further research to understand drug induced changes in steroid homeostasis during chronic administration of amphetamine based ADHD treatments, notably in the pediatric population. Obtained results, should then support an appropriate benefit-risk assessment of these drugs. ...|$|R
