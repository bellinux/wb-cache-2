25|$|The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Committee on Physical Agents has {{established}} a TLV for UV-C exposure to avoid such skin and eye injuries among those most susceptible. For 254nm UV, this TLV is 6 mJ/cm² over an eight-hour period. The TLV function differs by wavelengths because of variable energy and potential for cell damage. This TLV {{is supported by the}} International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and is used in setting lamp safety standards by the <b>Illuminating</b> <b>Engineering</b> Society of North America. When TUSS was planned, and until quite recently, this TLV was interpreted as if eye exposure in rooms was continuous over eight hours and at the highest eye-level irradiance found in the room. In those highly unlikely conditions, a 6.0 mJ/cm² dose is reached under the ACGIH TLV after just eight hours of continuous exposure to an irradiance of 0.2 μW/cm². Thus, 0.2 μW/cm² was widely interpreted as the upper permissible limit of irradiance at eye height.|$|E

This paper describes the history of and ongoing efforts in curricular and educational technology development for the Infinity Project, a joint effort between educators, administrators, and industry leaders to establish an engineering curriculum {{at the high school}} level. Several issues are considered, including the choice and design of the technology platform used in the curriculum, the curricular and technology development timeline, and the design examples chosen to <b>illuminate</b> important <b>engineering</b> concepts within the curriculum. We also provide a list of key best practices and challenges in developing novel pre-colleg...|$|R
40|$|Technological {{change is}} argued {{to be taking}} place along ordered and {{selective}} patterns, shaped jointly by technological and scientific principles, and economic and other societal factors. Historical, descriptive analysis {{is often used to}} analyze these "trajectories". Recently, quantitative methods have been proposed to map these trajectories. It is argued that such methods have, so far, not been able to <b>illuminate</b> the <b>engineering</b> side of technological trajectories. In order to fill this gap, a methodology proposed by Hummon and Doreian (1989) is used and extended to undertake a citation analysis of patents in the field of fuel cells.

Merit Award for quality structural engineering. Thomas Hacker Architects {{was presented with}} the 2002 AIA Regional Honor Award by the Northwest and Pacific Region of the American Institute of Architects through its Design Awards Program; jurors noted the library's [...] "rigorous but poetic" [...] structure and its [...] "outstanding tectonic harmony, from the smallest scale of details to the basic design concept". The building also received the 2000 AIA Portland Chapter Honor Award, the 2000 Portland General Electric EarthSmart Award, the 2001 AIA American Library Association Award of Excellence (for its [...] "simple and elegant design") and the 2002 Chicago Athenaeum American Architecture Award. The <b>Illuminating</b> <b>Engineering</b> Society of North America presented an award for the library's quality lighting design. Ginnie Cooper, director of libraries for Multnomah County, said of the recognition: [...] "Library users love this building and we're pleased with how much the architectural community has applauded it as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Scriabin wrote only a {{small number}} of orchestral works, they are among his most famous, and some are {{performed}} frequently. They include a piano concerto (1896), and five symphonic works, including three numbered symphonies as well as The Poem of Ecstasy (1908) and [...] (1910), which includes a part for a machine known as a [...] "clavier à lumières", known also as a Luce (Italian for [...] "Light"), which was a colour organ designed specifically for the performance of Scriabin's tone poem. It was played like a piano, but projected coloured light on a screen in the concert hall rather than sound. Most performances of the piece (including the premiere) have not included this light element, although a performance in New York City in 1915 projected colours onto a screen. It has been claimed erroneously that this performance used the colour-organ invented by English painter A. Wallace Rimington when in fact it was a novel construction supervised personally and built in New York specifically for the performance by Preston S. Miller, the president of the <b>Illuminating</b> <b>Engineering</b> Society.|$|E
40|$|Modern society {{could hardly}} {{function}} without the large-scale, network-centric information systems that pervade government, defense, and industry. As a result, serious failures or compromises carry far-reaching consequences. These systems {{are characterized by}} changing and often unknown boundaries and components, constantly varying function and usage, and complexities of pervasive asynchronous operations. Their complexity challenges human intellectual control, and their survivability has become an urgent priority. Engineering methods based on solid foundations and the realities of network systems are required to manage complexity and ensure survivability. Flow-Service-Quality (FSQ) engineering is an emerging technology for management, acquisition, analysis, development, evolution, and operation of large-scale, network-centric systems. FSQ engineering is based on Flow Structures, Computational Quality Attributes, and Flow Management Architectures. These technologies can help provide stable engineering foundations for the dynamic and often unpredictable world of large-scale, network-centric systems. Flow Structures define enterprise mission task flows and their refinements into uses of system services in network traversals. Flows are deterministic for human understanding, despite the underlying asynchronism of network operations. They can be refined, abstracted, and verified with precision, and deal explicitly with Uncertainty Factors, including uncertain commercial off-the-shelf functionality and system failures and compromises. Computational Quality Attributes go beyond static, a priori estimates to treat quality attributes such as reliability and survivability as dynamic functions to be computed in system operation. Computational Quality Attribute requirements are associated with flows and can be dynamically reconciled with network service attributes in execution. Flow Management Architectures include design and implementation frameworks for dynamically managing flows and attribute requirements, as well as processes for their development. FSQ foundations are defined by theorems that <b>illuminate</b> <b>engineering</b> practices and automation opportunities...|$|R
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} city {{models are}} presently {{being used in}} many sectors. The potentiality of three dimensional data has been exploited by many researchers and applications. It has been realized that 3 D data are not only for visualization or navigation but to solve more complex problem like urban planning, disaster management, facility management etc. Such a problem is solar energy potentiality analysis and shadow effect analysis {{in this case is}} even harder. Photovoltaic cells are being popular for energy production. So many applications have been developed to know the potentiality before using this technology. The quality of the result depends on shadow effect which is very difficult to detect. 3 D city models are high quality, realistic and with high details and geometries. So, 3 D city models are the most practical option for detecting shadow. This paper will present a concept for detecting realistic shadows using 3 D city models and getting highly accurate result of photovoltaic energy production taking the shadow effect into consideration. Levels of detail 2 and 3 CityGML data which contains roof structure, vegetation, thematically differentiated surface and texture are suitable to simulate exact real-time shadow. LIDAR point clouds are also triangulated to produce a TIN for 3 D city modeling. Solar radiation data during the whole day and around the year and photovoltaic cells response to the radiation can be modeled using available simulation environment like INSEL. The recent research works in this direction has been mentioned in this paper and the need for the investigation of this approach has been <b>illuminated.</b> WatermanagementCivil <b>Engineering</b> and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Metabolic {{engineering}} aims at {{modifying the}} endogenous metabolic network of an organism to harness {{it for a}} useful biotechnological task, for example, production of a value-added compound. Several levels of metabolic engineering can be defined and are the topic of this review. Basic 'copy, paste and fine-tuning' approaches are limited {{to the structure of}} naturally existing pathways. 'Mix and match' approaches freely recombine the repertoire of existing enzymes to create synthetic metabolic networks that are able to outcompete naturally evolved pathways or redirect flux toward non-natural products. The space of possible metabolic solution can be further increased through approaches including 'new enzyme reactions', which are engineered on the basis of known enzyme mechanisms. Finally, by considering completely 'novel enzyme chemistries' with de novo enzyme design, the limits of nature can be breached to derive the most advanced form of synthetic pathways. We discuss the challenges and promises associated with these different metabolic <b>engineering</b> approaches and <b>illuminate</b> how enzyme <b>engineering</b> is expected to take a prime role in synthetic metabolic engineering for biotechnology, chemical industry and agriculture of the future...|$|R
2500|$|Photometria {{presented}} significant {{advances and}} it was, perhaps, {{for that very}} reason that its appearance was greeted with general indifference. The central optical question {{in the middle of the}} 18th century was: what is the nature of light? Lambert work was not related to this issue at all and so Photometria received no immediate systematic evaluation, and was not incorporated into the mainstream of optical science. The first appraisal of Photometria appeared in 1776 in Georg Klügel’s German translation of Priestley’s 1772 survey of optics. An elaborate reworking and annotation appeared in 1777. [...] Photometria was not seriously evaluated and utilized until nearly a century after its publication, when the science of astronomy and the commerce of gas lighting had need for photometry. Fifty years after that, <b>Illuminating</b> <b>Engineering</b> took up Lambert's results as the basis for lighting calculations that accompanied the great expanse of lighting early in the 20th century. Fifty years after that, computer graphics took up Lambert's results as the basis for radiosity calculations required to produce architectural renderings. Photometria had significant, though long delayed influence on technology and commerce once the industrial revolution was well underway, and is the reason that it was one of book listed in Printing and the Mind of Man.|$|E
