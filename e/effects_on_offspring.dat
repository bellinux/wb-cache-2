These developmental programming effects may be mediated by fetal exposure to glucocorticoids, which is regulated {{in part by}} placental 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 β-HSD) type 1 and 2. We tested whether a maternal high-fat, high-sucrose diet would alter expression of placental 11 β-HSD 1 and 2, thereby increasing fetal exposure to maternal glucocorticoids, with downstream <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>offspring</b> physiology and behaviour. C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed a high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet or a nutrient-matched low-fat, no-sucrose control diet prior to and during pregnancy and lactation. At day 17 of gestation, HFHS dams had ~ 20 % lower circulating corticosterone levels than controls. Furthermore, {{there was a significant}} interaction between maternal diet and fetal sex for circulating corticosterone levels in the fetuses, whereby HFHS males tended to have higher corticosterone than control males, with no effect in female fetuses. However, placental 11 β-HSD 1 or 11 β-HSD 2 expression did not differ between diets or show an interaction between diet and sex. To assess potential long-term consequences of this sex-specific effect on fetal corticosterone, we studied locomotor activity and metabolic traits in adult offspring.
