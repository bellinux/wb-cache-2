5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and {{her mother}} visit her brother Bill and his {{pregnant}} wife Tara around Christmas time. Scully answers the phone, and {{the person on the}} other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego where a group of cops are investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another telephone call from the same person on her cell phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to listen to and help Scully <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on.|$|E
5|$|The {{employees}} pursue Michael, and {{he confesses}} that {{he created the}} rumors to conceal the one true rumor. Andy fears {{that it might be}} the one about him. The employees urge Michael to tell them which one is true, but just as Michael is about to give in, Jim announces that Pam is actually pregnant to save Stanley. Michael denies it, but Pam shows her baby's ultrasound picture to prove it. Later, while Michael discusses her pregnancy with Jim and Pam in his office, Stanley's wife Teri returns Michael's call from earlier. He picks up the phone with the intention of making an excuse for his earlier call so as to not tip her off, but he accidentally calls her Cynthia twice before Jim hangs up the phone for him. Teri had already been suspicious of Stanley and Cynthia, so Michael calling her Cynthia is enough for her to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on. Michael, feeling guilty, watches from his office window as Stanley attacks Michael's car with a tire iron in a fit of rage. At the end of the episode, the three interns discuss what they have learned at Dunder Mifflin, which they essentially reveal was nothing.|$|E

Charlie gets jealous when she ignores him at lunch and makes {{arrangements}} to meet Richard after school to discuss time travel with him.

Kenny was being filmed by a documentary crew during the process of the surgery, so House has to find out what is wrong with Kenny while being filmed by the crew.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com {{was critical of}} the episode's intricacy, writing, [...] "'The Amazing Maleeni' is a convoluted episode that ultimately lacks verve and excitement. Even if one can <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on, there remains {{the question of how}} much, or even whether, to care." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated it two stars out of five. The two noted that, had the episode used real magic tricks instead of [...] "resort to CGI, the episode would have been much more than a simple [...] "cheat". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson criticized the fact that the explanation behind Maleeni turning his head around 360 degrees was never satisfactorily explained. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris compared the episode's plot to the 1999 movie Arlington Road, noting that while [...] "the scheme is fun to watch while it unfolds, [...] in the end, it's not credible; too much is left open to chance for it really to happen." ...|$|E

500|$|Wondering {{why he has}} {{not seen}} any of his GE colleagues, Jack's office {{assistant}} Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) suggests that maybe they are the last people on Earth, as he references the 2007 film I Am Legend, [...] "You're Will Smith and I'm the dog!" [...] In I Am Legend, Will Smith's character is the last healthy human in New York City and lives with his dog. In order to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on, Jonathan does investigative work and downloads Don Geiss's schedule while self-narrating to the theme music of [...] (1996). After Kenneth convinces her to call her [...] "future husband", Liz, who speaks in a Jamaican accent as Dr. Kaplan's dental assistants are Jamaican women, tells the man he needs to come into Dr. Kaplan's office for some work, and Liz ends the call with [...] "Cool Runnings, man! Bobsled!" [...] This is {{a reference to the}} comedy movie Cool Runnings (1993) in which the Jamaica national bobsled team made their debut in the 1988 Winter Olympics. In another scene, Liz's ringtone is the song [...] "Fuck the Pain Away" [...] by Canadian electronic musician Peaches.|$|E
500|$|Parker voices {{his suspicions}} about {{the crew of}} [...] "Skyship One" [...] to Penelope after he notes their lack of {{knowledge}} about the airship and Penelope relays this message to Alan but during the conversation uncovers a listening device in her room after Skyship One passes through a violent storm. Foster and his associates have secretly been recording and editing Penelope's speech to assemble a false transmission, which requests that Jeff dispatch Thunderbirds 1 and 2, with Brains on board, to El Hadim airfield where the Hood and his henchmen will be waiting to hi-jack the machines. Unable to get Penelope to say the detailed part of the message (landing coordinates of the airstrip) naturally, they use a fake newspaper to get her to read the final details aloud to complete {{the last part of the}} message just before their stop at the Egyptian Pyramids. When Skyship One makes its final stop in the Swiss Alps, while Foster, Alan, Tin-Tin, and Lady Penelope dine at a steam train themed inn, Parker locates the editing equipment and informs the guests, whilst they attempt to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on the edited message is transmitted and sent to John on Thunderbird 5. Alan determines the threat against International Rescue just in time for Penelope to contact Jeff in person and warn that Thunderbirds 1 and 2 are about to be ambushed. Dispatched by Jeff in accordance with the transmission, Scott and Virgil now open fire on and annihilate the Hood's hideout.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the shooting, Donald Trump called for a [...] "total and complete" [...] ban on Muslims entering the United States [...] "until our country's representatives can <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on." [...] Trump's statement drew widespead condemnation, including from the White House, the Pentagon, the United Nations, and foreign leaders such as British Prime Minister David Cameron and French Prime Minister Manuel Valls. Trump's suggestion was met with condemnation from both Democratic and Republican candidates for the presidency in 2016. Trump, {{in an interview on}} Good Morning America, cited the internment of Japanese Americans, German Americans, and Italian Americans during World War II as precedent for his proposal.|$|E
2500|$|Radical economists point out, that a {{considerable}} portion of incomes and expenditures is not {{captured by the}} GDP concept because it falls outside the defined production boundary, while incomes/expenditures within the production boundary are allocated to categories which are substantially misleading. Not only are GDP data frequently revised after first publication, but the popular idea that GDP equals [...] "the whole economy" [...] is a fallacy. The more that the national accounts system has been revised across fifty years, and the more that economic theory and practice has changed, the less meaningful national accounts aggregates have become in capturing {{what is happening in}} reality. Analysts end up doing a lot of detailed disaggregate research to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on, because the official national accounts aggregates don't tell them what they want to know (more detailed data is increasingly available, because official statisticians make available digital data warehouses, enabling datamining). The 2008 revision of the UNSNA standard national accounts tries to realign the system more with the modern realities of capital finance, but in the process, the original intention of the accounts to measure [...] "physical" [...] changes in wealth is, in some respects, superseded. According to OECD data for the year 2000, cited by the World Bank, physical capital represents only one-quarter of the capital stock of rich countries, and all the rest is [...] "intangible capital". But UNSNA national accounts were originally never designed to measure the [...] "intangible capital." [...] The contemporary concept of [...] "wealth creation" [...] is substantially different from the concept that was entertained in the mid-20th century, among other things because who exactly and legally owns the wealth, often becomes a secondary issue in business. An asset may be held which generates profit income, but it could be a borrowed asset via-via, or an asset the value of which can be difficult to define. This can create new problems for statisticians seeking to estimate additions to wealth.|$|E
