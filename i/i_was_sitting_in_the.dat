500|$|Reds catcher Clyde Sukeforth {{asserted}} that Wilson {{should have been}} credited with an additional home run in 1930 as well. [...] "He hit one in Cincinnati one day", he said, [...] "way up in the seats, hit it so hard that it bounced right back onto the field. The umpire had a bad angle on it and ruled that it had hit the screen and bounced back. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cincinnati bullpen, and of course, we weren't going to say anything. But Hack really hit 57 that year." [...] Wilson's official total of 56 stood as the NL record until the 1998 season, when it was broken by Sammy Sosa (66) and Mark McGwire (70).|$|E

I asked who {{he could be}} again and again — {{but there was no}} answer. I tried to make him laugh but he remained silent. At last the stranger began to sing — then Don Juan knew who it was. It was death." [...] On the same piece of paper, he wrote the bassoon theme for the [...] first part of the second movement, out of which a pizzicatoed string [...] "walking bass" [...] stems. Two months later in Florence, he drafted the second theme, with a note reading [...] "Christus," [...] perhaps symbolizing the death and resurrection of the movement, or even of Finland. Scholars also suggest that Sibelius modeled the second movement after Dante's Divine Comedy. Nonetheless, Robert Kajanus said that the movement [...] "strikes one as the most broken-hearted protest against all the injustice that threatens at the present time to deprive the sun of its light and our flowers of their scent." [...] The movement culminates with a towering, brassy theme, following by an ethereal, mist-like motif in the divided strings.|$|E
