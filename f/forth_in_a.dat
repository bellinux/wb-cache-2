5|$|In {{the course}} of Romanization, the Celtic polytheism of the local tribes was merged – syncretized – with the Roman religion. The Celtic deities came to be worshiped under {{the names of their}} Roman counterparts. Thus Lugus was {{replaced}} by Mercury, Belenus by Apollo, Taranis by Jupiter and so <b>forth,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> practice called interpretatio romana by Caesar, who pioneered it. Roman gods also acquired the names of local gods as epithets; thus Mars was venerated as Mars Caturix, Mercury as Mercurius Cissonius and Jupiter as Jupiter Poeninus after the god of the Pennine Alps.|$|E

He expressed grave suspicions of adjectives, nebulous terminology, and all language that might be subjective. He praised a spare, clean, and precise vocabulary for science and explanations that are as comprehensible as possible. In Sprat's account, the Royal Society explicitly rejected anything that seemed like scholasticism. For Sprat, as {{for a number of}} the founders of the Royal Society, science was Protestant: its reasons and explanations had to be comprehensible to all. There would be no priests in science, and anyone could reproduce the experiments and hear their lessons. Similarly, he emphasised the need for conciseness in description, as well as reproducibility of experiments.|$|E

500|$|From the {{earliest}} days of the academy, one form of punishment for cadets who commit regulatory infractions has been a process officially known as punishment tours. This process is better known to the cadets as [...] "hours" [...] because as punishment, cadets must walk a specified number of hours in penalty.

Being late to class or having an unkempt room may result in as little as 5 hours while more severe misconduct infractions may result in upwards of 60 to 80 hours. In its most traditional form, punishment tours are [...] "walked off" [...] by wearing the dress gray uniform under arms and walking back and <b>forth</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> designated area of the cadet barracks courtyard, known as [...] "Central Area." [...] Cadets who get into trouble frequently and spend many weekends [...] "walking off their hours" [...] are known as [...] "area birds."

[...] An alternate form of punishment to walking hours is known as [...] "fatigue tours," [...] where assigned hours may be [...] "worked off" [...] by manual labor, such as cleaning the barracks. Certain cadets whose academics are deficient may also conduct [...] "sitting tours," [...] where they have to [...] "sit hours" [...] in a designated academic room in a controlled study environment, for which they receive half credit towards their reduction of tours. Cadets' uniforms are inspected before their tours begin each day. A small number of cadets may be relieved of their tours that day if their uniforms are exceptionally presentable.
