25|$|A branch {{connection}} {{was made from}} Aberavon (Burrows Junction) to Briton Ferry Dock on 30 December 1893; the line swept {{to the west of}} the GWR main line. The line towards Swansea opened on 14 December 1894 to goods; it left the Briton Ferry <b>Dock</b> <b>line</b> (at Briton Ferry Junction) and crossed under the GWR main line, then running northwards, following close on its east side through Briton Ferry village. It was difficult to make a route through this section, as the GWR line, housing and industrial works were all close together; in fact the route picked its way at the back of houses, and the station was on an embankment between two rows of houses.|$|E
50|$|Brentford {{railway station}} was opened in 1849 by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) {{in a period}} of mainly {{passenger}} use - an unlinked perpendicular line, the Brentford <b>Dock</b> <b>line</b> operated between 1859 and 1964, mainly for goods and waste transfer. The <b>Dock</b> <b>Line</b> between 1860 and 1942 ran a passenger service into passenger terminus Brentford (GWR) railway station.|$|E
50|$|The Rothesay <b>Dock</b> <b>line</b> {{was closed}} in the 1960s, but it was reopened when {{imported}} coal {{was brought to the}} dock in the early 1980s. Traffic ceased again in 1988 and the line has since been removed.|$|E

50|$|A short branch {{from the}} Penarth <b>Dock</b> <b>line</b> {{to the town}} was opened on 20 February 1878. Known as the Penarth Extension Railway, it was a mile long, running up a {{gradient}} of 1 in 40 from Cogan Junction to Penarth Town.|$|E
50|$|The Brentford branch line, {{also known}} as the Brentford <b>Dock</b> <b>Line,</b> is a freight-only branch railway line in west London, England. It runs {{south-east}} from the Great Western Main Line at Southall to a goods yard and waste transfer station in Brentford. Opened in 1859, until 1964 it also ran to Brentford Dock, for a total distance of 4 miles (6.4 km).|$|E
50|$|Many Dockvillers bring {{inflatable}} floats for {{lounging in}} the water. To prevent floaters from drifting in the current, a stationary <b>dock</b> <b>line</b> {{is set up}} across the water adjacent to the floating dock. The iconic Oasis Float Island was the flagship float of the 2nd and 3rd Annual Dockville Regattas, but it was retired after suffering multiple puncture wounds by raucous party-goers.|$|E
50|$|When {{the mineral}} {{activity}} in the area declined after 1960, so did the PTR&D system, and the OVE lines (dormant in 2017) and the <b>dock</b> <b>lines</b> at Port Talbot are the only remaining tracks in use.|$|R

50|$|The Hull and Hornsea Railway {{opened in}} 1864, {{initially}} terminating at Wilmington station, {{just before the}} junction with the <b>dock</b> <b>line,</b> {{in the same year}} the Victoria Dock Branch Line, excluding the River Hull bridge, was doubled. Sidings south of the junction between the Hull-Hornsea, and Victoria Dock Branch lines developed from a coal drops and a single siding in the mid 19th centuries, to a full goods station, Wilmington goods {{by the beginning of the}} 20th.|$|E
50|$|About 1,000 yards (900 metres) {{forward of}} the <b>Dock</b> <b>Lines,</b> a {{rectangular}} redoubt was built at Stoke on top of Mount Pleasant. It was an earthwork with stone facings, defended by a ditch and drawbridge. The remains of the redoubt {{can be seen in}} Mount Pleasant Park.|$|R
5000|$|A further steep drop in mineral {{activity}} {{resulted in}} all of the remaining network except for short stubs at Port Talbot and the <b>dock</b> <b>lines</b> being closed between 1964 and 1967. The Great Western Railway had been taken into nationalised ownership at the beginning of 1948.|$|R
50|$|Dock tramcar {{station was}} {{situated}} on the southeast side of the dock's main entrance lock and {{at right angles to}} it. Directly opposite the station {{on the other side of}} the lock was a conventional railway station, also called Immingham <b>Dock.</b> <b>Lines</b> from the two set off in opposite directions.|$|R
50|$|In most cases, rope is {{the term}} used only for raw material. Once a section of rope is {{designated}} for a particular purpose on a vessel, it generally is called a line, as in outhaul line or <b>dock</b> <b>line.</b> A very thick line is considered a cable. Lines that are attached to sails to control their shapes are called sheets, as in mainsheet. If a rope is made of wire, it maintains its rope name as in 'wire rope' halyard.|$|E
50|$|On 27 February 1986, the Webb <b>Dock</b> <b>line</b> {{was opened}} by Minister for Transport, Tom Roper. It was {{built as a}} freight line to service the Webb Dock {{container}} port in Melbourne, with provision for the line to be converted to dual gauge. This attracted some controversy, as the line used 1,600 mm broad gauge, which was criticised by ANL, claiming that it was costing the shipping industry millions of dollars per year (ANL contributed to {{the building of the}} line, and used dual gauge within its area of the dock).|$|E
50|$|According to Iarnród Éireann, {{the project}} has {{provided}} the ability to operate 20 trains per hour in both directions through the Howth Junction to Grand Canal <b>Dock</b> <b>line,</b> which caters for Howth DARTs, Malahide DARTs, Northern Commuter trains, Belfast Enterprise services, Sligo InterCity, Western and South Western Commuter services, {{as well as other}} services in the Connolly to Grand Canal Dock area. This means that more trains travel through Connolly rather than terminating; it has also facilitated the use of the Phoenix Park rail tunnel for commuter rail connections.The project began in March 2015 and was commissioned on 17 July 2016.|$|E
50|$|This is the {{junction}} where the Hamworthy Freight Branch to Poole docks joins the main line. There is a disused third platform {{at the station}} facing the Poole <b>docks</b> <b>line.</b> The signal box which controlled the branch was at the Poole end of platform 2 but has since been demolished.|$|R
50|$|The Filton Triangle depot or Stoke Gifford depot is {{a railway}} depot being built for high speed trains {{procured}} under the Intercity Express Programme. The depot is situated between Filton and Stoke Gifford at a junction {{intersection of the}} Cross Country Route, South Wales Main Line and the Filton to Avonmouth (<b>docks)</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|Drybrook Quarries {{were closed}} and the branch from Whimsey ceased to {{function}} in February 1953. The section from Churchway sidings, back to Bilson, closed on 28 December 1965, {{and the rest of}} the line, back to Bullo Pill, closed to freight on 3 August 1967. The Bullo Pill <b>Docks</b> <b>line</b> closed on 12 August 1963.|$|R
50|$|One {{intermediate}} station, Gowerton, also lies on this single-track stretch, {{with just}} the former Down (i.e. westbound) platform in use for trains in either direction. The disused former Up platform (without track) is still in existence. Less {{than half of all}} trains passing through Gowerton can be scheduled to make stops owing to pathing limitations. Additionally, this tight pathing compromised route performance which can amplify delays and hence impact connections {{into and out of the}} long-distance Intercity services between Swansea, Cardiff and London. This is important since there are many interchange passengers from the Pembroke <b>Dock</b> <b>line</b> (which is mainly served by trains terminating at Swansea) for Cardiff and English destinations.|$|E

50|$|Suburban {{passenger}} services between Princes Street and North Leith (simply named Leith until 1903) commenced on 1 August 1879. The final approach to Leith docks for goods trains was always congested, and duplicate lines were constructed for passenger trains, {{parallel to the}} goods lines, for the final approach from Newhaven Junction to a new passenger terminus at North Leith.The Caledonian obtained Parliamentary authorisation to build a line to Cramond Brig, a rural location west of Granton, on 25 July 1890. This was a speculative branch intended to open up new residential districts, in collaboration with a property developer. The line opened as a branch from the Granton <b>Dock</b> <b>line</b> at Craigleith on 1 March 1894. Cramond Brig was renamed Barnton from 1903. So lucrative was {{the development of new}} residential areas that the Caledonian considered extending to form a loop to Corstorphine, returning to Edinburgh, but this was never achieved and it was the North British Railway that built to Corstorphine.|$|E

50|$|Shore Road Goods was a goods {{terminus}} in Birkenhead, England. The {{goods station}} was situated near to Morpeth Dock, on the Birkenhead <b>Dock</b> Branch railway <b>line,</b> {{and operated by}} the Cheshire Lines Committee. The CLC was granted permission to run two locomotives on the <b>dock</b> <b>lines</b> from 13 March 1884. The engine shed, which adjoined the goods station, was opened in 1888 and closed in 1961. The main building of the goods station is still in existence, and is used as an office for Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council's archives service.|$|R

50|$|Construction {{was fairly}} straightforward, {{and the first}} revenue traffic was {{conveyed}} on 30 August 1897, entering the Port Talbot North <b>Dock</b> <b>lines</b> via Copper Works Junction, that is, the southern route. The line opened as far as Lletty Brongu for mineral traffic the following day, 31 August 1897. In the middle of January 1898 the mineral working was extended to the Garw at Pontyrhyll Junction.|$|R

50|$|In addition, it {{requires}} competent crewmembers to understand 'taking a turn' around a cleat {{and to be}} able to make cleated lines secure. Lines and halyards need to be coiled neatly for stowage and reuse. <b>Dock</b> <b>lines</b> need to be thrown and handled safely and correctly when coming alongside, up to a buoy, and when anchoring, as well as when casting off and getting under way.|$|R
50|$|The {{area was}} the {{northern}} extremity of the Bootle and North <b>Docks</b> <b>lines</b> of Liverpool's tramway network. From the boundary with Bootle, it ran for ¾ {{of a mile}} along Linacre Road to a terminus at the junction with Bridge Road. This short stretch was the last horse drawn service in Liverpool, switching to electric operation in August 1903, {{eight months after the}} rest of the system converted.|$|R
