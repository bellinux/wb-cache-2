5|$|Zoo or {{laboratory}} rearing and isolation are important factors leading to increased susceptibility to self-harm in higher mammals, e.g., macaque monkeys. Non-primate mammals are also known to mutilate themselves under laboratory conditions after administration of drugs. For example, pemoline, clonidine, amphetamine, and very high (toxic) doses of caffeine or theophylline {{are known to}} precipitate self-harm <b>in</b> <b>lab</b> animals.|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2007, the National Institutes of Health deemed hexavalent chromium VI (chromium-6) to be a likely carcinogen <b>in</b> <b>lab</b> animals when consumed in large quantities in drinking water. Prior to the NIH study, a World Health Organization study found that chromium-6 was a likely cause of lung cancer when inhaled by humans. In 2010, test results released from a California non-profit group known as the Environmental Working Group showed that Norman's tap water has a chromium-6 concentration level of 12.90 parts per billion (ppb), which was the highest level detected among 35 U.S. cities sampled in the study. The group is studying chromium-6 levels in water supplies in an attempt to prove a causal link between the element's ingestion and cancer in humans, and as a result improve the country's water standards.|$|E

25|$|Some {{people have}} objected against {{extending}} {{the results of}} model organisms to the plant world.

For these reasons, a comparative study of plant traits has been proposed as the way to go now.|$|E

40|$|Women {{contend with}} gender bias in certain science contexts, which {{suggests}} {{they may be}} likely to adopt prevention-focused modes of regulation aimed at maintaining safety and security in such settings. This study represented an integrated test of regulatory focus theory (RFT; Higgins, 1997, 1998) and the critical mass hypothesis, which assumes that women are attracted to scientific career fields in which their group represents a majority. Participants were 255 female undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and/or mathematics (STEM) majors enrolled in science laboratory classes. Results indi-cated that number of men <b>in</b> <b>labs</b> moderated the mediated relationship between affiliation and intrinsic science motivation via academic satisfaction. This moderated mediation effect was observed at low, but not average or high, levels of men <b>in</b> <b>labs.</b> No such effect was observed at high levels of women <b>in</b> <b>labs.</b> Theoretical and empirical implications for research related to the underrepresentation of women in STEM are discussed...|$|R

25|$|The main {{materials}} {{used for the}} nano-studs are silver, gold, and aluminium, to name a few. However, gold and silver are not very efficient, as they absorb much of {{the light in the}} visible spectrum, which contains most of the energy present in sunlight, reducing the amount of light reaching the cell. Aluminium, on the other hand, absorbs only ultraviolet radiation, and reflects both visible and infra-red light, so energy loss is minimized on that front. Aluminium is therefore capable of increasing the efficiency of the cell by up to 22% (<b>in</b> <b>lab</b> conditions).|$|E
25|$|Among primary endosymbionts of insects, the best-studied are the {{pea aphid}} (Acyrthosiphon pisum) and its endosymbiont Buchnera sp. APS, the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans and its endosymbiont Wigglesworthia glossinidia brevipalpis and the endosymbiotic protists in lower termites. As with endo{{symbiosis}} in other insects, the symbiosis is obligate in {{that neither the}} bacteria nor the insect is viable without the other. Scientists {{have been unable to}} cultivate the bacteria <b>in</b> <b>lab</b> conditions outside of the insect. With special nutritionally-enhanced diets, the insects can survive, but are unhealthy, and at best survive only a few generations.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>lab</b> {{animals of}} all ages, {{environmental}} enrichment has {{been related to}} dendritic branching, spine density, and overall number of synapses. In addition, skill training {{has been shown to}} lead to the formation and stabilization of new spines while destabilizing old spines, suggesting that the learning of a new skill involves a rewiring process of neural circuits. Since the extent of spine remodeling correlates with success of learning, this suggests a crucial role of synaptic structural plasticity in memory formation. In addition, changes in spine stability and strengthening occur rapidly and have been observed within hours after training.|$|E
25|$|Humans are {{a social}} species {{with a long}} history of living in tribal groups. The {{psychological}} mechanisms that evolved to handle the complexities of group living have also created heuristics for quickly categorizing others as ingroup or outgroup members, with different behavioral strategies for each: treat ingroup members (those in one’s own group) favorably, and react to outgroup members (those who belong to a different group) with fear and aggression. These tendencies arise with little motivation, and have been provoked over superficial groups <b>in</b> <b>lab</b> studies—for example, by showing paintings to participants and creating groups based on which painting participants prefer. Ingroup and outgroup preferences have also been observed in other social primates, such as the rhesus macaque.|$|E
25|$|In July 2007, Sherk {{successfully}} {{defended his}} title against Hermes França at UFC 73. After the fight, the California State Athletic Commission (CSAC) announced that Sherk had {{tested positive for}} Nandrolone, a banned steroid, in a urine test the day prior to the fight. After testing positive for 12ng/ml of Nandrolone, Sherk was fined $2,500 and suspended from competing in California for one year. Sherk's suspension was reduced to six months after appealing his allegations on December 4, 2007, making him eligible to fight in early January 2008. Sherk argued that errors were made <b>in</b> <b>lab</b> testing procedures. He asserted that the lab had failed to properly test the vials used in earlier, positive tests for any remaining steroid content, which may have resulted in his sample becoming contaminated. Quest Diagnostics and the CSAC denied any errors were made.|$|E
