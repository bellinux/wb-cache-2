25|$|A {{total of}} 226 {{species of birds}} have been {{observed}} at Lake Ilo NWR, including the endangered whooping crane, and the threatened bald eagle and piping plover. During fall migrations, as many as 100,000 waterfowl such as Canada geese, mallards, northern pintail, blue-winged teal, <b>double-crested</b> <b>cormorant</b> and great blue heron can be seen each year. While {{the vast majority of}} bird species are most abundant during the spring and fall migrations, some bird species can be found year-round.|$|E
25|$|The {{unofficial}} {{symbol of}} Haliburton and Muskoka is the loon, also honoured as Ontario's provincial bird. In addition to loons, other water birds {{on the lake}} include the great blue heron, the great egret, the sandhill crane, and the hooded merganser. Other water birds include {{a wide variety of}} ducks, grebes, bitterns, herons, terns, and mergansers as well as the Canada goose, the <b>double-crested</b> <b>cormorant,</b> the ring-billed and herring gull, the common sandpiper, the killdeer, the common snipe, the Virginia rail, the sora, the American coot, and the common moorhen.|$|E
25|$|Sea birds (magnificent frigatebird, brown booby, masked booby, terns, <b>double-crested</b> <b>cormorant</b> (Phalacrocorax auritus), pelican, petrels) nest on {{the cliffs}} and {{uninhabited}} islands. In particular, on Grand-ÃŽlet, a natural reserve of the archipelago which houses species of booby found nowhere else on les Saintes: red-footed booby (Sula sula) and blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii). But {{in the context}} of global warming and invasive foreign species implanted by the humans (e.g. red lionfish), the environment and the biodiversity of these islands are considered to be very vulnerable and to be protected. It is therefore recommended that visitors do not take plants or capture animals to avoid disturbing the species in their natural biotope, and do not pollute the ecosystem.|$|E

2500|$|Historic Hill {{contains}} Bird House, Bird Garden, Sea Lion Sound, Herpetarium, Chain of Lakes, Flight Cage and Cypress Swamp, and Primate House. The Bird House features birds {{as varied}} as bald eagle, rhinoceros hornbill, hyacinth macaw, burrowing owl, toco toucan, Cape thick-knee, golden pheasant, kookaburra, Mariana fruit-dove, king vulture, horned guan, superb starling, tawny frogmouth, and the Guam kingfisher, which is extinct in the wild. The Bird Garden contains outdoor bird enclosures. Sea Lion Sound provides an underwater viewing tunnel of California sea lions and three harbor seals. The herpetarium houses most of the zoo's reptiles and amphibians, including the critically endangered Jamaican iguana, Chinese alligator, McCord's box turtle, Panamanian golden frog, and Arakan forest turtle. Other species include the Komodo dragon, green anaconda, mountain chicken, spotted turtle, false gharial, king cobra, Gila monster, frill-necked lizard, Aldabra giant tortoise, tuatara, reticulated python, tiger salamander, three-toed amphiuma, pancake tortoise, and over two dozen species of pit vipers from around the world. The Chain of Lakes {{is a series of}} small enclosures between the Bird House and the Herpetarium and Primate House, where the zoo's North American river otters and alligator snapping turtles reside.

40|$|The {{populations of}} European great {{cormorants}} (Phalacrocorax carbo) and North American <b>double-crested</b> <b>cormorants</b> (Phalacrocorax auritus) have increased sharply {{over the last}} decades and these piscivorous birds are suspected to deplete valuable fish stocks and compete with human fisheries. Beyond direct consumption of fish, cormorants are accused of injuring vast numbers of prey without eating them. Using underwater video systems, one of them mounted {{onto the back of}} tame Chinese cormorants, we evaluated the proportion of successful pursuits of cormorants on live fish. Trials were conducted with 6 great <b>cormorants</b> and 9 <b>double-crested</b> <b>cormorants</b> and involved a total of 676 prey pursuits. We show that, although they are regarded as highly efficient predators, cormorants aborted about half of their pursuits. However, detailed analysis of prey-capture behaviour in <b>double-crested</b> <b>cormorants</b> revealed that only 0. 4 % of the prey pursued was injured without being ingested. Further studies using miniature video systems deployed on free-ranging cormorants are required tocomplement our knowledge of their hunting tactics...|$|R

50|$|For populations nesting in the Great Lakes region, it is {{believed}} that the colonization of the lakes by the non-native alewife (a small prey fish) has provided optimal feeding conditions and hence good breeding success. <b>Double-crested</b> <b>cormorants</b> eat other species of fish besides alewives and have been implicated(By who?) in the decline of some sport-fish populations in the Great Lakes and other areas. Scientists(Which ones?) are not in agreement about the exact extent of the role of cormorants in these declines, but some believe that <b>double-crested</b> <b>cormorants</b> may be a factor for some populations and in some locations.|$|R
50|$|The <b>double-crested</b> <b>cormorant's</b> numbers {{decreased}} in the 1960s {{due to the}} effects of DDT. Colonies have also been persecuted {{from time to time in}} areas where they are thought to compete with human fishing.|$|R
40|$|Although {{it is well}} {{established}} that wild birds, such as cormorants, carry virulent avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV- 1; causative agent of Newcastle disease) and avian influenza virus (AIV), the prevalence of these viruses among <b>Double-crested</b> <b>Cormorants</b> (Phalacrocorax auritus) in the Great Lakes region of North America has not been rigorously studied. We determined the prevalences of APMV- 1 and AIV in <b>Double-crested</b> <b>Cormorants</b> from the interior population of eastern North America. From 2009 to 2011, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and serum samples were collected from 1, 957 individual <b>Double-crested</b> <b>Cormorants,</b> ranging from chicks to breeding adults, on breeding colony sites in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Mississippi, USA, and Ontario, Canada, {{as well as on}} the wintering grounds of migratory populations in Mississippi, USA. Prevalence of antibodies to APMV- 1 in afterâ€“hatch year birds was consistently high across all three years, ranging from 86. 3 % to 91. 6 %. Antibody prevalences in chicks were much lower: 1. 7, 15. 3, and 16. 4 % in 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. Virulent APMV- 1 was detected in six chicks sampled in 2010 in Ontario, Canada. Only one adult was positive for AIV-specific antibodies and five individuals were positive for AIV matrix protein, but the latter were negative for H 5 and H 7 AIV subtypes. We provide further evidence that <b>Double-crested</b> <b>Cormorants</b> play an important role in the maintenance and circulation of APMV- 1 in the wild, but are unlikely to be involved in the circulation of AIV...|$|R

40|$|<b>Double-crested</b> <b>cormorants</b> (Phalacrocorax auritus) are {{receiving}} increasing attention in North America because of depredations at aquaculture facilities and alleged impacts on sport and commercial fisheries. We obtained recent (most since 1994) {{estimates for the}} number of nesting <b>double-crested</b> <b>cormorants</b> in the United States and Canada from published references and by conducting telephone interviews with State and Provincial biologists. Using published data, we also determined annual rates of change in the number of cormorants since about 1990. The estimated minimum number of nesting pairs (colonies) of <b>double-crested</b> <b>cormorants</b> was 372, 000 (852). Most cormorants nested in the Interior region (68 percent). Overall, <b>double-crested</b> <b>cormorants</b> increased about 2. 6 percent annually during the early 1990 â€™s. The greatest decline (2 Ì† 6 #; 7. 9 -percent annual change) was in the West Coastâ€“Alaska region. The greatest increase (6. 0 -percent annual change) was for the Interior region. The increase there was primarily a consequence of a 22 -percent annual increase in Ontario and U. S. States bordering the Great Lakes. These baseline population data are essential for monitoring trends in nesting populations and for developing informed management decisions. However, the completeness, quality, and timing of surveys varied substantially among jurisdictions. Population estimates and rates of change should, therefore, be used with caution. Methods and timing of future surveys should be coordinated among political jurisdictions (at least within regions) to improve accuracy of estimates and allow more meaningful comparisons of population status...|$|R
