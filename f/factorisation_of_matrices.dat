30|$|All the {{aforementioned}} methods can be straightforwardly {{extended to the}} discretisation of dynamic equations using implicit time discretisation (e.g. Implicit Euler scheme or implicit Newmark schemes). However, at each time step, {{the resolution of the}} resulting linear system is required for the computation of the velocity field (or most often the displacement field in elasticity). We highlight that, in linear elasticity, this could be done in practice by performing a <b>factorisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>matrices</b> to invert, since they are constant in time. However, for large scale problems, {{it is not possible to}} store any <b>factorisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>matrices</b> and it is even difficult to store preconditioners. A popular approach to increase the efficiency of dynamic solvers was first proposed in computational fluid dynamics in the late 1960 s [25 – 28], and it is called fractional-step projection. This family of methods aims at accurately solving the equation governing viscous incompressible fluids by performing a time-discretisation in which viscosity and incompressibility are treated in two separate steps. In more detail, the first half-step (Burgers step) corresponds to an elliptic Boundary Value Problem (BVP) for an intermediate velocity, accounting for viscosity diffusion and advection. The second half-step (projection step) represents an inviscid problem where the end-of-step, divergence-free velocity is computed, along with pressure distribution. This step essentially consists in solving a Poisson problem. In this way, at each time step two decoupled elliptic equations are solved, and this is very advantageous for large scale simulations [29 – 31].|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} finding a rank-revealing QR (RRQR) <b>factorisation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>matrix</b> A {{consists}} <b>of</b> permuting the columns of A such that the resulting QR factorisation contains an upper triangular matrix whose linearly dependent columns are separated from the linearly independent ones.

Then a hierarchy of "greedy " algorithms is derived to solve these optimisation problems, and it is shown that the existing RRQR algorithms correspond to particular greedy algorithms in this hierarchy. Matrices on which the greedy algorithms, and therefore the existing RRQR algorithms, can fail arbitrarily badly are presented. Finally, motivated by an insight from the behaviour of the greedy algorithms, the authors present "hybrid " algorithms that solve the optimisation problems almost exactly (up to a factor proportional to the size <b>of</b> the <b>matrix).</b> Applying the hybrid algorithms as a follow-up to the conventional greedy algorithms {{may prove to be}} useful in practice...|$|R

40|$|Methods for {{representing}} the inverse of Linear Programming (LP) basis matrices {{are closely related}} to techniques for solving a system of sparse unsymmetric linear equations by direct methods. It is now well accepted that for these problems the static process <b>of</b> reordering the <b>matrix</b> in the lower block triangular (LBT) form constitutes the initial step. We introduce a combined static and dynamic <b>factorisation</b> <b>of</b> a basis <b>matrix</b> and derive its inverse which we call the partial elimination form of the inverse (PEFI). This factorization takes advantage of the LBT structure and produces a sparser representation of the inverse than the elimination form of the inverse (EFI).

To represent the factored inverse it is, however, necessary to introduce special data structures which are used in the forward and the backward transformations (the two major algorithmic steps) of the simplex method. These correspond to solving a system of equations and solving a system of equations with the transposed matrix respectively. In this paper we compare the nonzero build up of PEFI with that of EFI.

To obtain the least square solution of such systems efficiently, it is desired to maintain a good column ordering such that fill-ins are reduced. This comes at a cost since general ordering changes require the complete re-computation of the Cholesky factor. While some methods have obtained good results with reordering at loop closing, the changes are not guaranteed to be limited to the scope of the loop, leading to suboptimal performance. In this article, it is shown that the Cholesky <b>factorisation</b> <b>of</b> an updated <b>matrix</b> can be efficiently recovered from the previous factorisation if the permutations are localised.

40|$|Generalized {{probabilistic}} theories (GPT) {{provide a}} general framework that includes classical and quantum theories. It {{is described by}} a cone C and its dual C^*. We show that whether some one-way communication complexity problems can be solved within a GPT {{is equivalent to the}} recently introduced cone <b>factorisation</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding communication matrix M. We also prove an analogue of Holevo's theorem: when the cone C is contained in R^n, the classical capacity of the channel realised by sending GPT states and measuring them is bounded by n. Polytopes and optimising functions over polytopes arise in many areas of discrete mathematics. A conic extension of a polytope is the intersection of a cone C with an affine subspace whose projection onto the original space yields the desired polytope. Extensions of polytopes can sometimes be much simpler geometric objects than the polytope itself. The existence of a conic extension of a polytope is equivalent to that <b>of</b> a cone <b>factorisation</b> <b>of</b> the slack <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> the polytope, on the same cone. We show that all 0 / 1 polytopes whose vertices can be recognized by a polynomial size circuit, which includes as a special case the travelling salesman polytope and many other polytopes from combinatorial optimisation, have small conic extension complexity when the cone is the completely positive cone. Using recent exponential lower bounds on the linear extension complexity of polytopes, this provides an exponential gap between the communication complexity of GPT based on the completely positive cone and classical communication complexity, and a conjectured exponential gap with quantum communication complexity. Our work thus relates the communication complexity of generalisations of quantum theory to questions of mainstream interest in the area of combinatorial optimisation. Comment: 23 page...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (J. Comp.

It was found capable of handling fluid flow problems in random heterogeneous media with high stochastic dimension, but a convergence theory was missing. This paper provides a convergence analysis for the method in the case when the QMC method is a specially designed randomly shifted lattice rule. The convergence result depends on the eigenvalues of the underlying nested block circulant matrix and can be independent {{of the number of}} stochastic variables under certain assumptions.

40|$|Various schemes are {{available}} to solve coupled transport/reaction mathematical models, {{one of the most}} efficient and easy to apply being the two-step split- operator method in which the transport and reaction steps are performed separately. Operator splitting, however, does not solve exactly the fully coupled numerical model derived from the governing partial differential and algebraic equations describing the transport and reaction processes. An error, proportional to Δt (the time step used in the numerical solution) is introduced. Thus, small time steps must be used to ensure that accurate solutions result. An alternative scheme is presented, which iterates to the exact solution of the fully coupled numerical model. The new scheme enables accurate solutions to be calculated more efficiently than the two- step method, while maintaining separation of the transport and reaction steps in the calculations. As in the two-step method, the reaction calculations are performed node-wise throughout the computation grid. However, because the scheme relies on LU <b>factorisation</b> <b>of</b> the coefficient <b>matrix</b> in the transport equation solution, the reaction calculations must be performed in sequence, the sequence order being determined by the ordering of the nodes in the grid.
