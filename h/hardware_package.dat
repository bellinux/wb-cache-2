Using hardware simulation and modeling to implement key elements, results are compared against identical function blocks in a software environment.

This article based on the Matlab image processing technologies offers image recognition of the defects, and extracts the defects information of the image feature. After statistical analyses of the defect information extracted, the location of the defect concentrating region and the area of the defect region can be determined, and the research shows that the result is basically consistent with the actual distribution of the defects of the side of the <b>hardware</b> <b>package</b> of the small box. By using the image processing technology, the extraction of feature information on the heat sealing defects will be more accurate, and the data information collection of the defect characteristics provides the theoretical basis for analyzing the causes why the defects occur and improving the heat sealing system of the GDX 2 packaging machine...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the design, construction, {{preliminary}} testing, and potential applications of three forms of miniaturized analytical instrumentation. The first is an optical fiber instrument for monitoring pH and other cations in aqueous solutions. The instrument couples chemically selective indicators that were immobilized at porous polymeric films with a <b>hardware</b> <b>package</b> that provides the excitation light source, required optical components, and detection and data processing hardware. The second is {{a new form of}} a piezoelectric mass sensor. The sensor was fabricated by the deposition of a thin (5. 5 micron) film of piezoelectric aluminum nitride (AIN). The completed deposition process yields a thin film resonator (TFR) that is shaped as a 400 micron square and supports a standing bulk acoustic wave in a longitudinal mode at frequencies of approx. 1 GHz. Various deposition and vapor sorption studies indicate that the mass sensitivity of the TFR's rival those of the most sensitive mass sensors currently available, though offering such performance in a markedly smaller device. The third couples a novel form of liquid chromatography with microlithographic miniaturization techniques. The status of the miniaturization effort, the goal of which is to achieve chip-scale separations, is briefly discussed...|$|E
