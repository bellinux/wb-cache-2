(1991) {{reported}} {{the detection of}} nine electric field impulses {{over a period of}} 53  min during the Galileo spacecraft’s Venus flyby in 1991 at about 4 – 5  RV (Venus radii), i.e., a range of about 20, 000  km. Although at the time, they reported that “lightning is the most likely source,” the lead on this investigation has informed us (Gurnett, personal communication, 23 May 2017) that he no longer believes lightning to be responsible, noting that impulsive signals could arise from (1) spacecraft electronics, (2) plasma waves, (3) dust impacts, (4) thermal stresses that cause discontinuous mechanical motions that are coupled to the antennas via microphonic effects, and (5) other unknown effects. Although control observations were carried out during two 1  h intervals (when no impulses were seen), these were well before the Venus flyby and well after the Venus flyby. Notably, the high-voltage component of a plasma instrument (PLS) was active during the close approach period but was off during the control intervals. Thus, {{it is possible that the}} operation of the PLS <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>unit</b> close to Venus was responsible for the signals interpreted at the time as lightning. It may also be noted that if the impulses really were due to lightning, the observed rate is much lower than would be observed for terrestrial lightning at a comparable radial distance.|$|E
40|$|Electrostatic {{precipitators}} (ESP) or electrofilters remove flying {{ashes and}} fine particles from the flue gas in thermal power plants, before passing the gas into the chimney. Maximum allowable value of dust is 50 mg/m 3 {{and it requires}} that {{the efficiency of the}} ESPs better than 99 %, which calls for an increase of active surface of the electrodes, hence increasing the filter volume and the weight of steel used for the filter. In previous decades, electrostatic precipitators in thermal power plants were fed by thyristor controlled, single-phase fed devices having a high degree of reliability, but with a relatively low collection efficiency, hence requiring large effective surface of the collection plates and a large weight of steel construction in order to achieve the prescribed emission limits. Collection efficiency and energy efficiency of the electrostatic precipitator can be increased by applying high frequency high voltage power supply (HF HV). Electrical engineering faculty of the University of Belgrade (ETF) has developed technology and HF HV equipment for the ESP power supply. This solution was subjected to extensive experimental investigation at TE Morava from 2008. to 2010. High frequency power supply is proven to reduce emission two times in controlled conditions while increasing energy efficiency of the precipitator, compared to the conventional thyristor controlled 50 Hz supply. Two high frequency <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>unit</b> AR 70 / 1000 with parameters 70 kV and 1000 mA are installed at TE Morava and thoroughly testes. It was found that the HF HV power supply of the ESP at TE Morava increases collection efficiency so that emission of fine particles and flying ashes are halved, brought down to only 50 % of the emissions encountered with conventional 50 Hz thyristor driven power supplies. On the basis of this study, conclusion is drawn that the equipmentcomprising HF HV supplies are the best solution for new ESP installations, {{as well as for the}} reconstruction of existing facilities. The paper describes the topology of the HF HV power supply, power management and controls, and brings the most importantdetails of the implementation. It is found that the HF HV solution achieves several significant improvements over the conventional thyristor system. It is possible to provide more precise control ofthe ESP parameters such as the output voltages and currents. It isalso possible to make a rapid increase or decrease in voltage andto effectuate a very fast response to load changes. Due to this advantages it is possible to suppress the supply quickly in the caseof sparking, reducing the spark energy and the quantity of ionized gasses produced by the electric arc. Reduction in the spark energy is up to 10 times compared to conventional thyristors solution. This means that the erosion of the electrode system is significantly reduced, and that the quality of the collection plates is preserved for much longer periods. At the same time, lower quantity of ionized gasses produced by the spark contribute to much shorter de-ionization intervals, required to quit sparking and evacuate charged particles in order to reinstate the voltage and proceed with the operation. In addition, HF HV power supply provides a significant reduction in size and weight of the complete ESP installation, hence reducing the tons of steel that has to be built in. Therefore, the HF HV power supply may be the key instrument to reducing the cost of the de-dusting ecological equipment. Besides, size and weight reduction leads to cost savings of installation and maintenance. According to estimates, savings in steel may reach 30 %, contributing to the overall cost savings of roughly 20 %.
