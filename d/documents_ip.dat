40|$|Motivation Traditionally, {{conflicts}} {{between public and}} corporate collaborators concern aspects of confidentiality, publishing, intellectual property rights (IPRs) and ownership 1. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are knowledge-based relationships; hence the management of intellectual property (IP) is of critical importance. The initial knowledge of each partner brought in the partnership, i. e. the background IP, is a crucial starting point for collaboration. Further, {{the management of the}} knowledge created by the partnership throughout the project, i. e. foreground IP, depends on many practical decisions, such as whether or not an idea is protected, where the IP protection is pursued, how exclusive rights are deployed, by whom and for which purpose 2. The different expectations of and approach to IP by the various stakeholders must be taken into account. The need is high for stakeholders to work together, get rid of unrealistic, outmoded and conflicting expectations of IP from multiple stakeholders 1; 3. There is a lot of uncertainty about the approach towards IP management. The optimal model for promoting innovation with respect IPRs of the collaborators has not been defined yet 3. In-depth insights in the impact of various IPRs rules applied in PPPs, is urgently needed. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate to what extent IPR rules vary across (precompetitive) PPPs. This study will serve to further explore the impact of the variation of various IPR rules in order to develop best practices for further optimizing collaborative efforts and to engage stakeholders in sharing objectives and develop common approaches to address the aspects of IP 3; 4. Research questions 1) To which extent do IPR rules vary across precompetitive PPPs? 2) What is the impact of the variation of IPR rules across precompetitive PPPs? Research methodology Comparative analysis of IPRs <b>documents</b> (<b>IP</b> policies, IP guidelines, IP principles and Grant Agreements/Project Agreements templates) related to precompetitive PPPs. Abstract The pharmaceutical sector faces major challenges in the discovery and development of new drugs and therapies. New approaches and insights with respect to novel or existing compounds are hardly needed. Based on the principle that knowledge development is enhanced through sharing of ideas and resources, R&D projects at the precompetitive level are increasingly conducted in public-private partnerships (PPPs). Such precompetitive PPPs are presented through multifaceted partnering models and reflect heterogeneity of partners with different, often conflicting objectives and cultures. It is not surprising that intellectual property rights (IPRs), so crucial in pharmaceutical R&D, play a pivotal role in safeguarding partner’s interests, and that IPRs and trust issues take a crucial part of the negotiation process 5 - 12. The open nature of the so-called precompetitive PPPs complicates agreements with respect to IPRs. The empirical study identifies IPRs concepts used in life sciences precompetitive PPPs and explores the variation of those concepts across precompetitive PPPs. IPRs principles, policies, guidelines, grant agreements and project agreements of 19 precompetitive PPPs have been analyzed. Key concepts such as background IPRs, foreground IPRs, (co-) ownership, access rights and IPRs management are compared. Some precompetitive PPPs allow a certain degree of flexibility during negotiations on IPRs whereas others require partners to stick clearly at restrictive contractually defined IPRs. The executive office of a precompetitive PPP can be an intermediary, but in a few cases it has an active role as partner with equal rights in terms of ownership. Ownership of background IPRs remains with the original owner in 8 of the PPPs investigated. The other PPPs did not include specific guidance on the ownership rights to background IPRs. In terms of foreground IPRs, 8 PPPs assign ownership of new inventions to the idea generator(s), 3 PPPs claim foreground ownership and in 1 case, the partners and the PPP are co-owners of foreground IP. The rules on access rights to background IPRs vary between royalty-free access versus access on ‘fair and reasonable conditions’. Access rights to foreground IPRs cover much more possibilities. The IPRs management is heavily context specific; there is no ‘one size fits all’. In precompetitive PPPs, some projects are only focused on training, education and basic information sharing, whereas other projects are aimed at evolving towards a proof-of-concept stage, wherein access to background IPRs and development of foreground IPRs can implicate the progression of the process. Depending on the scope, the objectives and expected outcome of the project, certain project agreements require very clear and upfront specified grant IPRs clauses, whereas other projects may include more general grant IPRs clauses, leaving room for possible IPRs negotiations further in the project development. For precompetitive PPPs acting as information sharing platforms, flexibility in the IPRs policy might be of key importance 12; 13. A stepwise approach whereby open source templates guide initial knowledge exchange, followed by a ‘closure’ step after which IPRs could be contractually defined once the project becomes more specific, could increase trust and clear early IPRs issues, offering beneficial solutions for both public and private stakeholders. status: accepte...|$|E

40|$|Accounting {{constitutes}} {{a very specific}} form of language, which is highly standardized, mathematical in nature and seeks to uniformly and systematically describe events while avoiding expressions of individual creativity or explicit political positions. In this sense, accounting is a social, cultural and historical artefact rather than a natural or technical phenomenon and can therefore {{be viewed as the}} decisive instrument to create and maintain imagined business communities. On the balance sheet, IP experiences a specific form of authorization. It is represented in the discourse of accounting by ‘intangibles’, an imprecise term associated with the increasingly observed ‘gap between the market and book value’, while current accounting systems are determined by a tangible assets’ based perspective and offer little scope to <b>document</b> how <b>IP</b> relates to business performance.

40|$|Patent {{databases}} {{provide valuable}} information for technology management. However, {{the rapid growth}} of patent documents, the lengthy text and the rich of content in technical terminology, and the complicated relationships among the patents, make it taking a lot of human effort for conducting analyses. As a result, an automated system for assisting the inventors in patent analysis as well as providing support in technological innovation is in great demand. In this paper, a Semantic-based Intellectual Property Management System (SIPMS) has been developed for supporting the management of intellectual properties (IP). It incorporates semantic analysis and text mining techniques for processing and analyzing the patent documents. The method differentiates itself from the traditional technological management tools in its knowledge base. Instead of eliciting knowledge from domain experts, the proposed method adopts global patent databases as sources of knowledge. The system enables users to search for existing patent <b>documents</b> or relevant <b>IP</b> <b>documents</b> which are related to a potential new invention and to support invention by providing the relationships and patterns among a group of <b>IP</b> <b>documents.</b> The method has been evaluated by benchmarking with the performance against traditional text mining technique and has successfully been implemented at a selected reference site.

40|$|Tries {{are among}} the most {{versatile}} and widely used data structures on words. They are pertinent to (internal) structure of (stored) words and several splitting procedures used in diverse contexts ranging from <b>document</b> taxonomy to <b>IP</b> addresses lookup, from data compression (i. e., Lempel-Ziv’ 77 scheme) to dynamic hashing, from partial-match queries to speech recognition, from leader election algorithms to distributed hashing tables and graph compression. While the performance of tries under a realistic probabilistic model is of significant importance, its analysis, even for simplest memoryless sources, has proved difficult. Rigorous findings about inherently complex parameters were rarely analyzed (with a few notable exceptions) under more realistic models of string generations. In this paper we meet these challenges: By a novel use of the contraction method combined with analytic techniques we prove a central limit theorem for the external path length of a trie under a general Markov source. In particular, our results apply to the Lempel-Ziv’ 77 code. We envision that the methods described here will have further applications to other trie parameters and data structures...|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{intercept}} point {{is based on}} the assumption of a weakly nonlinear system, meaning that higher-order nonlinear terms are small enough to be negligible.In practice, the weakly nonlinear assumption may not hold for the upper end of the input power range, be it during measurement or during use of the amplifier. As a consequence, measured or simulated data will deviate from the ideal slope of n.The intercept point according to its basic definition should be determined by drawing the straight lines with slope 1 and n through the measured data at the smallest possible power level (possibly limited towards lower power levels by instrument or device noise).It is a frequent mistake to derive intercept points by either changing the slope of the straight lines, or fitting them to points measured at too high power levels. In certain situations such a measure can be useful, but it is not an intercept point according to definition. Its value depends on the measurement conditions that need to be <b>documented,</b> whereas the <b>IP</b> according to definition is mostly unambiguous; although there is some dependency on frequency and tone spacing, depending on the physics of the device under test.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} specifies {{a framework}} to integrate a Network Address Translation (NAT) layer into an operator’s network {{to function as}} a Carrier-Grade NAT (also known as CGN or Large-Scale NAT). The CGN infrastructure will often form a NAT 444 environment as the subscriber home network will likely also maintain a subscriber-side NAT function. Exhaustion of the IPv 4 address pool is a major driver compelling some operators to implement CGN. Although operators may wish to deploy IPv 6 to strategically overcome IPv 4 exhaustion, near-term needs may not be satisfied with an IPv 6 deployment alone. This document provides a practical integration model that allows the CGN platform to be integrated into the network, meeting the connectivity needs of the subscriber while being mindful of not disrupting existing services and meeting the technical challenges that CGN brings. The model included in this <b>document</b> utilizes BGP/MPLS <b>IP</b> VPNs, which allow for virtual routing separation, helping ease the CGN’s impact on the network.

40|$|Using animal {{models of}} alcoholism, {{previous}} {{studies suggest that}} neuropeptide Y (NPY) may be implicated in alcohol preference and consumption due to {{its role in the}} modulation of feeding and anxiety. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis previously identified an interval on rat chromosome 4 that is highly associated with alcohol preference and consumption using an F 2 population derived from inbred alcohol-preferring (iP) and -nonpreferring (iNP) rats. NPY mapped to the peak of this QTL region and was prioritized as a candidate gene for alcohol-seeking behavior in the iP and iNP rats. In order to identify a potential mechanism for reduced NPY protein levels <b>documented</b> in the <b>iP</b> rat, genetic and molecular components that influence NPY expression were analyzed between iP and iNP rats. Comparing the iP rat to the iNP rat, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction detected significantly decreased levels of NPY mRNA expression in the iP rat in the six brain regions tested: nucleus accumbens, frontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, caudate-putamen, and hypothalamus. In addition, the functional significance of three previously identified polymorphisms was assessed using in vitro expression analysis. The polymorphism defined by microsatellite marker D 4 Mit 7 in iP rats reduced luciferase reporter gene expression in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. These results suggest that differential expression of the NPY gene resulting from the D 4 mit 7 marker polymorphism may contribute to reduced levels of NPY in discrete brain regions in the iP rats...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Consider {{a generic}} data unit of random size L {{that needs to}} be {{transmitted}} over a channel of unit capacity. The channel dynamics is modeled as an on-off process {(Ai, Ui) }i≥ 1 with alternating independent periods when channel is available Ai and unavailable Ui, respectively. During each period of time that the channel becomes available, say Ai, we attempt to transmit the data unit. If L ≤ Ai, the transmission was considered successful; otherwise, we wait for the next period Ai+ 1 when the channel is available and attempt to retransmit the data from the beginning. We study the asymptotic properties of the total transmission time T and number of retransmissions N until the data is successfully transmitted. In recent studies [1], [2], it was proved that the waiting time T follows a power law when the distributions of L and A 1 are of an exponential type, e. g., Gamma distribution. In this paper, we show that the distributions of N and T follow power laws with exponent α as long as log P[L> x] ≈ α log P[A 1 > x] for large x. Hence, it may appear surprising that we obtain power law distributions irrespective of how heavy or light the distributions of L and A 1 may be. In particular, both L and A 1 can decay faster than any exponential, which we term superexponential. For example, if L and A 1 are Gaussian with variances σ 2 L and σ 2 A, respectively, then N and T have power law distributions with exponent α = σ 2 A/σ 2 L; note that, if σ 2 A < σ 2 L, the transmission time has an infinite mean and, thus, the system is unstable. The preceding model, as recognized in [1], describes a variety of situations where failures require jobs to restart from the beginning. Here, we identify that this model also provides a new mechanism for explaining the frequently observed power law phenomenon in data networks. Specifically, we argue that it may imply the power laws on both the application as well as the data link layer, where variable-sized <b>documents</b> and (<b>IP)</b> packets are transmitted, respectively. We discuss the engineering ramifications of our observations, especially in the context of wireless ad hoc and sensor networks where channel failures are frequent. Furthermore, our results provide an easily computable benchmark for measuring the matching between the data and channel characteristics that permits/prevents satisfactory transmission...|$|R
