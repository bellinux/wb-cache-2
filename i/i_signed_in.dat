Frank Hough offered Lajoie the contract on behalf of Mack. [...] "Hough offered me $24,000 ($ in current dollar terms) for four years.

Lajoie's batting average that year was [...]426 (it was originally recorded at [...]405, later changed to [...]422 before finally revised again to [...]426). The batting average mark became the all-time AL record after the number was revised. Previously, Ty Cobb and George Sisler had been credited with having the AL's all-time mark. That same year in a game against the Chicago White Sox' Clark Griffith, Lajoie became the second Major Leaguer to be intentionally walked with the bases loaded in an 117 game after Abner Dalrymple in 1881. For the 1901 season, Lajoie led the majors in doubles (48), and led the majors in hits (232), batting average (.426), runs (145), on-base (.463) and slugging percentage (.643), and total bases (350). His 125 RBIs led the AL and his 14 home runs were a career-best and his 48 doubles are a Philadelphia Athletics' record.

5000|$|The {{rivalry between}} the Philadelphia Phillies and Oakland Athletics, {{also known as}} the Philadelphia City Series was at its most intense from 1901-1955, when the Oakland Athletics played in Philadelphia. The rivalry was {{significant}} not only because both teams played in Philadelphia, but because of the strong competition between the National and American Leagues. The competition between the leagues was so strong that the A's and Phillies did not play at all from 1901-02 because of legal warring between the two parties. Related to growing tensions between the rival leagues, superstar Nap Lajoie had played for several years on the Phillies, but was displeased with the salary cap of $2,400 placed by the National League. When the American League was formed in 1901 and the A's joined it, Lajoie was offered a contract by Frank Hough of the Athletics on behalf of A's manager Connie Mack. When asked by a reporter what motivated him to leave, he responded [...] "Frank Hough offered me $24,000 ($682,656 in current dollar terms) for four years. You can bet <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> <b>in</b> a hurry!" [...] As a result, the Phillies filed a lawsuit to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court banning Lajoie from playing for any professional team. However, the decree only applied to teams in Pennsylvania, so Lajoie signed with the Cleveland Bronchos. When the decree expired, the Phillies chose not to file it again, and Lajoie left Cleveland to sign with the A's.|$|E

To some degree, however, it is tainted. The 1901 season was the first for the AL and the level of competition was presumably evolving. Such questions, however, in no way cast doubt on the extraordinary batting ability of the second baseman." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Here, {{we present}} a {{semiotic}} model of signaling pathways in B-cells in order to substantiate the view that semiotic modeling {{is required for the}} referential aspect of signaling processes to be grasped. We discuss how a process of asymmetry-formation through membrane closing puts living systems under selection pressure to develop semiotic competence, and, thus, signaling becomes a key process in the interface between system and environment. We introduce a number of notions in Peirce’s theory of signs, giving emphasis to the explanation of semiosis as a dynamic process in which chains of triads are instantiated, and develop a semiotic model of signaling pathways in B-cells based on those notions. We offer new, semiotic tools to model signaling in living systems, explaining how the relation to the same external object is maintained throughout several changes in the material bases of signaling (<b>i.</b> e., <b>signs)</b> <b>in</b> such systems...|$|R
