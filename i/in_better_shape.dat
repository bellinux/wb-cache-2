5|$|The British Army during World War I was {{the largest}} {{military}} force that Britain had put into the field up to that point.

5|$|Until the 1990s, {{there was}} little focus on {{expansion}} of the system because the system {{was in a state}} of disrepair, and funds were allocated to rebuilding and repairing the existing system. However, in the 1990s, with the system <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape,</b> the construction of the Second Avenue Subway was looked into again. Construction of the Second Avenue Subway started in 2007, and the first phase was completed in 2017. Since the 1990s, public officials and organizations such as the Regional Plan Association have pushed for the further expansion of the system. Projects such as the TriboroRx, a circumferential line connecting the outer boroughs, the reuse of the Rockaway Beach Branch, and the further expansion of the Second Avenue Subway have all been proposed, albeit unfunded.|$|E

5|$|By {{the start}} of 1943 Germany's armored forces had {{sustained}} heavy casualties. It was unusual for a Panzer Division to field more than 100 tanks, and most averaged only 70–80 serviceable tanks at any given time. After the fighting around Kharkov, Heinz Guderian embarked on a program to bring Germany's mechanized forces up to strength. Despite his efforts, a German panzer division could only count on an estimated 10,000–11,000 personnel, out of an authorized strength of 13,000–17,000. Only by June did a panzer division begin to field between 100–130 tanks each. SS divisions were normally <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape,</b> with an estimated 150 tanks, a battalion of self-propelled assault guns and enough half-tracks to motorize most of its infantry and reconnaissance soldiers—and these had an authorized strength of an estimated 19,000 personnel. At this time, the bulk of Germany's armor was still composed of Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs, although the 2nd SS Panzer Division had been outfitted {{with a number of}} Tiger I tanks.|$|E
5|$|Stanley {{called the}} General Assembly into special session in February 1917. At issue was reformation of the state's tax code, which Stanley felt {{unjustly}} burdened agricultural interests. The state was also incurring large deficits, ranging from $100,000 to $700,000 annually. Though Kentucky was <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> financially {{than many of}} its peers, Stanley still sought to balance the budget. The session lasted sixty days, and the legislature passed {{of many of the}} bills he advocated. The most significant created a three-member state tax commission, chaired by M. M. Logan. Additional taxes were passed on distilled spirits, oil production, race tracks, and corporate licenses. Assessments on the value of property, which had typically been evaluated at one-third to one-half of fair market price, rose dramatically. To balance this increase, legislators reduced the tax rates on certain types of property. With the dramatic increase in funds yielded by the special session, the General Assembly approved funding increases in nearly every part of state government, including higher education. The State Board of Health was given expanded powers, and county boards of health were established.|$|E
5|$|Rebuffed by Tarrasch, Lasker {{challenged}} the reigning World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz to {{a match for}} the title. Initially Lasker wanted to play for US $5,000 a side and a match was agreed at stakes of $3,000 a side, but Steinitz agreed {{to a series of}} reductions when Lasker found it difficult to raise the money. The final figure was $2,000, which was less than for some of Steinitz' earlier matches (the final combined stake of $4,000 would be worth over $495,000 at 2006 values). Although this was publicly praised as an act of sportsmanship on Steinitz' part, Steinitz may have desperately needed the money. The match was played in 1894, at venues in New York, Philadelphia, and Montreal. Steinitz had previously declared he would win without doubt, so it came as a shock when Lasker won the first game. Steinitz responded by winning the second, and maintained the balance through the sixth. However, Lasker won all the games from the seventh to the eleventh, and Steinitz asked for a week's rest. When the match resumed, Steinitz looked <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> and won the 13th and 14th games. Lasker struck back in the 15th and 16th, and Steinitz did not compensate for his losses {{in the middle of the}} match. Hence Lasker won convincingly with ten wins, five losses and four draws. Lasker thus became the second formally recognized World Chess Champion, and confirmed his title by beating Steinitz even more convincingly in their re-match in 1896–97 (ten wins, two losses, and five draws).|$|E

25|$|The {{division}} was subsequently sent to Nimes, France to rebuild, as many divisions mauled on the Eastern Front were. On 1 May 1944 it absorbed men and tanks of the 155th Reserve Panzer Division {{to return to}} its full strength. During this absorption it received 31 Panzer IIIs, 74 Panzer IVs, 20 assault guns, 15 Panther tanks and 200 other vehicles. The division then conducted training exercises up until June of that year. It was reassigned to an area on the Rhone River for a time. It was <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> {{than many of the}} other divisions in the area, which were refitting, forming, or lacked transportation to move effectively.|$|E
500|$|Hoping {{to rebound}} in 2008–09, Kiprusoff arrived {{for the start}} of the season <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape,</b> but {{continued}} to struggle as he was questioned on whether his heavy workload the previous three seasons — he played 76, 74 and 74 games of a possible 82 — were taking a toll on him. [...] He won his 200th career game on March 18, 2009, in a 2–1 victory over the Dallas Stars, but questions about whether he was playing too many games continued throughout the season. [...] Although he led the League with 45 wins, his statistical averages had deteriorated for the fourth consecutive season as he admitted he struggled.|$|E

500|$|To {{the left}} of Dog Green sat Dog White, between the Vierville and Les Moulins strongpoints (defending draws D-1 and D-3); and here was a {{different}} story. As a result of earlier mis-landings, and now because of their own mis-landing, the troops of C/116 found themselves alone at Dog White, {{with a handful of}} tanks from the first wave in sight. The smoke from the grass fires covering their advance up the beach, they gained the seawall with few casualties, and were <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> than any unit on the 116th RCT front so far. Although the 1st Battalion was effectively disarmed of its heavy weapons when D/116 suffered a disastrous landing, the buildup at Dog White continued. C/116 was joined by the 5th Ranger Battalion almost in its entirety. The Ranger commander, recognizing the situation at Dog Green on the run-in, ordered the assault craft to divert into Dog White. Like the C/116, the smoke covered their advance, although the 2nd Rangers were caught out on the right flank of the Ranger's landing. This was where the 116th RCT regimental command group, including the 29th Division assistant commander Brigadier General Norman [...] "Dutch" [...] Cota, was able to land relatively unscathed.|$|E
500|$|While Weinberg did {{not forget}} the breakup and long separation, he viewed it as [...] "at {{the same time the}} most horrifying {{experience}} I've ever been through and the most liberating."

When the tour concluded with ten shows at New York's Madison Square Garden, on several days Weinberg taped the Conan show at Rockefeller Center in the late afternoon, put his hands in ice and changed from his suit into jeans and a vest, and played with Springsteen at night. The experience of doing both left him [...] "professionally speaking, as alive as I've ever felt." [...] Of his position on the drum platform behind Springsteen, he says, [...] "I have the best seat in the house."

500|$|The tunnel {{construction}} became unintentionally {{involved in}} the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema applied for a position as an engineering technician with the Colorado Department of Transportation. She was given an assignment on the Straight Creek Tunnels project, but her supervisor misread her resume and thought he was hiring [...] "James". When the supervisor discovered the department had hired a woman, she was instead tasked with doing support work from the office. There was opposition to a woman entering the construction site: One supervisor stated that if she entered, [...] "Those workers would flat walk out of that there tunnel and they'd never come back". The workers, most of whom had a mining background, expressed a common superstition that a woman brought bad luck to a mine. One worker insisted, [...] "It's a jinx. I've seen too many die after a woman was in the tunnel." [...] Bonnema sued the department {{for the right to}} work inside the tunnel. She countered she was <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> and more agile than most of the men working on the tunnel. Emboldened by the passage of an equal rights law in Colorado, she finally entered the tunnel, with an entourage of reporters, on November 9, 1972. Some workers did walk off the job; at least one yelled, [...] "Get those women out of here". She remained determined and re-entered the tunnel a few days later. The next time she dressed in coveralls, and was even assigned tasks {{on the roof of the}} tunnel overlooking the men below. Surprised that nobody apparently noticed she was a woman, she stated, [...] "I had a good disguise".|$|E
