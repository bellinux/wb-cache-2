40|$|Simulation {{models that}} clarify {{the effects of}} water on crop yield are useful tools for {{improving}} farm level water management and optimizing water use efficiency. In this study, AquaCrop was evaluated for Karim genotype which is the main <b>durum</b> <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> (Triticum aestivum L.) practiced in Tadla. AquaCrop {{is based on the}} water-driven growth module, in that transpiration is converted into biomass through a water productivity parameter. The model was calibrated on data from a full irrigation treatment in 2014 / 15 and validated on other stressed and unstressed treatments including rain-fed conditions in 2014 / 15 and 2015 / 16. Results showed that the model provided excellent simulations of canopy cover, biomass and grain yield. Overall, the relationship between observed and modeled wheat grain yield for all treatments combined produced an R 2 of 0. 79, a mean squared error of 1. 01 t ha- 1 and an efficiency coefficient of 0. 68. The model satisfactory predicted the trend of soil water reserve. Consequently, AquaCrop can be a valuable tool for simulating wheat grain yield in Tadla plain, particularly considering the fact that the model requires {{a relatively small number of}} input data. However, the performance of the model has to be fine-tuned under a wider range of conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of the gluten index is a widely used method for analysing the gluten strength of bread wheat and spring durum wheat genotypes. The present work was carried out to study {{the effect of the}} genotype, meteorological factors (temperature, precipitation and number of days with Tmax ≥ 30 °C) and agronomic treatments (N fertilisation and plant protection) on the gluten index of <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> varieties and breeding lines. The results indicated that the gluten index had little dependence on the environment, being determined to the greatest extent by the genotype. Compared with varieties having weak gluten, those with a strong gluten matrix responded less sensitively to changes in environmental conditions. Among the meteorological factors, high temperature {{at the end of the}} grain-filling period caused the greatest reduction in the mean gluten index of three varieties (R 2 = 0. 462), while the fertiliser was found to be a significant factor affecting the gluten strength of <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> varieties. Using selection based on the gluten index, the gluten strength of <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> lines can be improved sufficiently to make them competitive with high quality spring varieties...|$|R
50|$|Proving the {{possibility}} of obtaining high yield cultivars from parents with low productivity (through heterosis), between 1967 and 1989, Zoe Țapu developed a research program for improving <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat,</b> {{in order to obtain}} cultivars with fall resistance and high yield, using height-reduction genes from summer durum developed at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico. In order to achieve that, she used dwarf plants from CIMMYT, which survived to a mild winter, back-crossing them with Romanian durum wheat varieties. Repeated selection for cold resistance of semi-dwarf variants {{led to the creation of}} the first semi-dwarf <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> varieties, Topaz (1977) and Rodur (1984).

40|$|Warming {{and drying}} {{in the eastern}} Mediterranean and the Middle East (EMME) {{associated}} with climate change may have consequences for humans and ecosystems, including agriculture. Agriculture can be directly affected through meteorological conditions that influence crop growth and yield. Here we explored changes in the yield of <b>durum</b> (<b>winter)</b> <b>wheat</b> Triticum tirgidum in the EMME region caused by projected changes in thermal and hydrological conditions, employing the agro-ecological zones (AEZ) methodology. The climate input was obtained from simulations by the PRECIS regional climate model over the EMME domain at 25 km resolution, driven by a range of IPCC emissions scenarios for the 21 st century. For the crop yield calculation, we used 2 steps of the biomass calculation from the AEZ methodology by calculating crop yield potentials with regard to temperature, solar radiation and evapotranspiration regimes. Our results showed that for the recent past, the highest wheat yields {{are found in the}} Fertile Crescent and the coastal areas of eastern Mediterranean Europe. The former region is projected to be negatively affected by the additional heat due to climate warming, while in the latter region yield gains may be expected. Our implementation of the AEZ methodology can be based on a range of climate data and can be applied to a number of crops, contributing to yield studies relevant for regional assessments of food security...|$|E

In particular we have compared three different General Circulation Models (HadCM 3, CCSM 3, ECHAM 5) subjected to a statistical downscaling under two future IPCC scenarios (B 1 and A 2). The analysis was carried out at regional scale repeating the simulations for seven homogeneous area characterizing the spatial variability of the region. In the second part of the study, considering only HadCM 3 data set, climate change impact on long-term sequences of the two crops combined in three crop rotations were evaluated in terms of yield performances and soil fertility as indicated by the soil organic content of carbon and nitrogen. The comparison between GCMs showed no significant differences for <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> yield, while noticeable differences were found for yield and irrigation requirements of tomato. Under future scenarios, the production levels were reduced for tomato, whereas positive yield effects were observed for <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat.</b> For <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> the simulation indicated that two- and three-year rotations, including one year of tomato cultivation, improved the cereal yield and this positive effect maintained its validity also in future scenarios.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{marker gene}} {{transfer}} procedure to <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> (Triticum durum Desf.) using microprojectile bombardment method and a regeneration {{system for the}} transformed mature embryos have been investigated in this study. Different bombardment pressures and distances were tested using gold particles of 1. 0 µm and 1. 6 µm average diameters. Efficiency of gene delivery was assessed by scoring transient GUS expression on bombarded embryos. The bombardment pressures of 650 psi or 1100 psi at a 6 cm sample plate distance provided efficient results. The bombarded tissues that showed resistance to the gradual increase of the selective agent, hygromycin-B antibiotic, up to 30 mg/L concentration yielded a total of 15 regenerated plants in vitro. However, these plants could not be grown into maturity in soil {{due to lack of}} vernalisation that is required for <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat.</b> Results obtained from this study could aid for further studies of durum wheat transformation and regeneration of fertile transgenic plants...|$|R

40|$|A {{long-term}} experiment comparing different {{crop residue}} (CR) managements {{was established in}} 1977 in Foggia (Apulia region, southern Italy). The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the long-term effects of different types of crop residue management on main yield response parameters in a continuous cropping system of <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat.</b> In order to correctly interpret the results, models accounting for spatial error autocorrelation were used and compared with ordinary least square models. Eight crop residue management treatments, based on burning of wheat straw and stubble or their incorporation with or without N fertilization and irrigation, were compared. The experimental design was a complete randomized block with five replicates. Results indicated that the dynamics of yield, grain protein content and hectolitric weight of <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> did not show any decline as usually expected when a monoculture is carried out for a long time. In addition, the temporal variability of productivity was more affected by meteorological factors, such as air temperature and rainfall, than CR management treatments. Higher wheat grain yields and hectolitric weights quite frequently occurred after burning of wheat straw compared with straw incorporation without nitrogen fertilization and autumn irrigation and this was attributed to temporary mineral N immobilization in the soil. The rate of 50 kg ha- 1 of N seemed to counterbalance this negative effect when good condition of soil moisture occurred in the autumn period, so yielding the same productive level of straw burning treatment...|$|R

40|$|Many {{climate change}} {{studies have been}} carried out in {{different}} parts of the world to assess climate change vulnerability and adapta-tion capacity of agricultural crops for certain environments character-ized from climatic, pedological and agronomical point of view. The objective of this study was to analyse the productive response of <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> and tomato to climate change and sowing/trans-planting time in one of the most productive areas of Italy (i. e. Capitanata, Puglia), using CERES-Wheat and CROPGRO cropping sys-tem models. Three climatic datasets were used: i) a single dataset (50 km x 50 km) provided by the JRC European centre for the period 1975 - 2005; two datasets from HadCM 3 for the IPCC A 2 GHG scenario for time slices with + 2 °C (centred over 2030 - 2060) and + 5 °C (centred over 2070 - 2099), respectively. All three datasets were used to generate synthetic climate series using a weather simulator (model LARS-WG). No negative yield effects of climate change were observed for <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> with delayed sowing (from 330 to 345 DOY) increasing the average dry matter grain yield under forecasted scenarios. Instead, the warmer temperatures were primarily shown to accelerate the phe-nology, resulting in decreased yield for tomato under the + 5 °C future climate scenario. In general, under global temperature increase by 5 °C, early transplanting times could minimize the negative impact of climate change on crop productivity but the intensity of this effect was not sufficient to restore the current production levels of tomato culti-vated in southern Italy...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the {{economic}} contribution of the wheat industry to the North Dakota economy. Wheat is produced in all areas of the state; however, production is concentrated in the Red River Valley and in the northern third of the state. Wheat production (spring, <b>durum,</b> and <b>winter</b> <b>wheat)</b> in North Dakota averaged about 9. 1 million planted acres and 275 million bushels annually from 2001 through 2003. Direct impacts (in-state expenditures and returns) from wheat production averaged $ 126. 50 per acre or $ 1. 14 billion annually from 2001 through 2003. Direct impacts from handling wheat at North Dakota elevators were estimated at $ 32 million annually. Transportation of wheat to both in-state and out-of-state destinations was estimated to generate $ 73 million annually in direct impacts. Annual direct impacts from wheat processing (milling activities) were estimated at $ 100 million. When secondary economic impacts were included, the wheat industry was estimated to have a gross business volume of $ 3. 56 billion annually from 2001 through 2003. Wheat industry activities also supported over 35, 000 full-time secondary jobs and generated $ 126 million in combined property tax, sales tax, individual income tax, and corporate income tax collections in North Dakota. Due primarily to reduced grain volume, current economic impacts from wheat production, grain handling, and transportation activities decreased from levels in 1991 through 1993. However, impacts from wheat processing increased by 121 percent in real terms between the two periods. Overall, the economic size of the wheat industry in North Dakota declined 33 percent from 1991 through 1993 to 2001 through 2003.

40|$|Quality and agronomic {{performance}} of 14 <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> genotypes (Gs) {{were examined in}} Austria, France and Hungary for 3 years. Heading time, wet gluten content, semolina yield and grain protein content are traits that showed G-dependent {{significant differences between the}} two management (M) systems examined (conventional and organic). Therefore, breeding for these traits could result in specifically adapted Gs for organic agriculture in different countries. Based on strong or moderately significant correlations between traits, gluten index and plant height could also be specifically selected in an indirect way. The need for environmentally specific selection for grain yield (GY) in later generations was also demonstrated. In general, varieties that had the highest performance in a given mega-environment (E) originated from that mega-E (except for yellow index). This finding provides evidence for the influence of the selection E, whether it is the M system or the growing region. As the French site fell into a distinct mega-E, it should be handled separately. The Hungarian site was found to be an ideal test E for selecting Gs with high adaptability for most of the quality traits, while the Austrian site could be used in selecting agronomic traits. This was also reflected in the breeding origin of the best <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> Gs for each trait. Based on these findings, a partly separate <b>winter</b> <b>durum</b> selection program is recommended for organic and low input agriculture in each country.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  6, from January to mid-March <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> {{is in the}} stage of {{overwintering}} and green. A weak negative correlation and positive correlation can be identified between incipient drought-affected crop areas and crop yields, implying that incipient droughts during the wintering and greening periods of <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> have no significant impacts on <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> yields and may even increase the yields of <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> slightly. Precipitation and air temperature are the main climatic factors that influence crop growth but they have different impacts on the growing crops in different growth stages. Regardless of the stage of crop growth, changes in cumulative precipitation during the growing season, especially during the earlier growing season, have {{the greatest impact on}} <b>winter</b> <b>wheat.</b> A persistent precipitation deficit will potentially have serious cumulative effects on the growth and development of <b>winter</b> <b>wheat,</b> and yield can be greatly reduced. Precipitation in the study region is mainly concentrated in July–September, accounting for about 70 % of the total annual precipitation. Seeding of <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> occurs mainly in October. The good soil moisture conditions of the study area in early autumn provide good water conditions for the seeding and overwintering of <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> (Li et al. 2000). After a long <b>wintering</b> period, <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> in the study region enters the green stage. The increase of solar radiation and the warming temperature promote the growth of crops. During this period, under incipient drought conditions, and although <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> may suffer some slight water stress, the promotion effect of increased temperature and radiation is dominant in its growth, and these conditions may even increase <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> yield. When drought conditions aggravate from moderate to higher intensity (Figs.  8, 9, 10), however, a more serious water deficit will potentially result in a decrease in <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> production.|$|R
30|$|Impacts of {{moderate}} droughts on <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> yield {{are similar to}} those of mild droughts (Figs.  7, 8). The difference is that mild drought during the wintering, greening, and jointing stages of <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> growth may have a promoting effect on yield. Moderate droughts have negative impacts on <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> yield during this same period and reduce <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> production (Zhang et al. 2008). From incipient drought to mild drought and moderate drought (Figs.  6, 7, 8), droughts of higher intensity have more significant impacts on <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> at its earlier growing season. For example, incipient drought can have discernable impacts on <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> yield during the filling period, while moderate droughts may have remarkable impacts on yield during the flowering, filling, and maturity period. In this sense, the impact of water stress on <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> yield is mainly reflected by the long-term cumulative effects (Huang et al. 2016). For severe and extreme droughts, the correlations between drought-affected crop areas and <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> production are less significant than those for mild and moderate droughts (Figs.  9, 10). What is particularly noteworthy is that the spatial pattern of severe and extreme droughts is significantly correlated with crop yield in October (Day 281 –Day 297 in Figs.  9, 10), and this is also the time period for seeding and the sprouting stage of the <b>winter</b> <b>wheat.</b> Severe drought events can trigger lower sprouting rates of <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> and have negative impacts on yield.|$|R

The results showed that Mo application increased the AO activities, the contents of abscisic acid (ABA) and indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) in the leaves of +Mo <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> under low temperature stress. No significant difference in the contents of GA 3 and Z was detected between -Mo and +Mo <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> at the earlier stage of low temperature stress, whereas the contents of gibberellin (GA 3) increased significantly, and zeatin (Z) decreased significantly in the leaves of +Mo <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> at the later stage of low temperature stress. Mo-deficiency also induced the drastic decrease of the ABA/GA in the leaves of <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> under low temperature stress.

The dramatic decrease in ABA and IAA levels in Mo deficient <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> may affect the homeostasis of endogenous hormones and Mo regulated cold resistance via the levels and balance of endogenous hormone in <b>winter</b> <b>wheat...</b>|$|R

In two years of research, the smallest spike length had a variety victorija (6, 4 cm in 2009 / 10 and 6, 6 cm in 2010 / 11), and the highest had variety zvezdica (7, 6 cm 2009 / 10 and 8, 5 cm in 2010 / 11). The lowest number of spikelets in the spike had variety progres, and most had a variety zvezdica. In two years of research, the lowest grain number in the spikes had variety angela (34. 6 in 2009 / 10 to 35. 5 in 2010 / 11), and the most had variety predel (46. 96 in 2009 / 10 and 46. 1 in 2010 / 11). The grain yield in spikes, in both years of research, statistically, the highest is at variety predel (2, 6 g in 2009 / 10 and 2, 5 g in 2010 / 11).

The highest average plant height, regardless of the years of research, had the progres variety (97. 7 cm), and the lowest – the angela variety (72. 7 cm). The highest average grain yield, regardless of the year of research, had the progres variety (6916 kg/ha), while the lowest (5100 kg/ha) – the angela variety. Regardless of the years of research and genotype, the general average grain yield of durum wheat amounted to 6, 229 kg/ha. The highest absolute mass of grains, regardless of the year of examination, had the progress variety (55. 7 g), and the lowest (45. 8 g) – the predel variety. Comparison of the varieties shows statistically significant differences {{at the level of}} 0. 05 and 0. 01. The hectoliter mass varies depending on the variety and year of cultivation. The biggest bulk mass of grains, regardless of the year of research, had the progress variety (80. 03 kg/hl), and the lowest (75. 19 kg/hl) – the pobeda– 2 variety. In the two years of research, there are high significant statistical differences among the varieties. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{maritime}} climates {{the production}} of <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> often leads to high nitrate leaching losses. In this study mixtures of <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> and catch crops were analyzed as alternative growing system to avoid high leaching losses. In a field experiment pure <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> grown as control showed highest N-losses. Leaching losses of 140 kg N ha- 1 after the pre-crop grass-clover and of 50 kg N ha- 1 after oats as pre-crop were measured. Compared to this, growing <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> in mixture with forage rape or oats reduced nitrate leaching by 50 %. Common vetch as mixture partner to <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> had a lower potential to reduce leaching losses. Comparable results were obtained growing the catch crops alone followed by spring wheat. Due to the competition for growth factors between catch crops and cereal, yields of the tested mixtures were {{lower than those of}} spring wheat grown after catch crops {{as well as of the}} <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> control.
