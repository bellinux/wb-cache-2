5|$|Khitan {{marriage}} practices {{differed from}} those of the Han Chinese in several ways. Men from the elite classes tended to marry women from the generation their senior. While this did not necessarily mean {{that there would be a}} large gap <b>in</b> <b>ages</b> between husband and wife, it was often the case. Among the ruling Yelü clan, the average age that boys married was sixteen, while the average age that girls married was between sixteen and twenty-two. Although rare, ages as young as twelve were recorded, for both boys and girls. A special variety of polygamy known as sororate, in which a man would marry two or more women who were sisters, was practiced among the Liao elite. Polygamy was not restricted only to sororate, with some men having three or more wives, only some of whom were sisters. Sororate continued throughout the length of the Liao dynasty, despite laws banning the practice. Over the course of the dynasty, the Liao elite moved away from polygamy and towards the Han Chinese system of having one wife and one or more concubines. This was done largely to smooth over the process of inheritance.|$|E
5|$|The Archadian Empire is {{ruled by}} House Solidor, headed by Emperor Gramis. The emperor's sons are Vayne and Larsa, the former a {{military}} genius and the game's main antagonist, {{and the latter}} a charismatic seeker of peace. Judge Magisters, upholders of Archadian law, protect House Solidor and execute every command issued by the ruling family. The technological marvels of airships and synthetic nethicite—a form of magicite that absorbs Mist—are thanks to Doctor Cid, a prominent researcher from Archadia. The Resistance against Archadia includes Dalmascan knight Vossler, an ally of Basch; Marquis Halim Ondore IV, the game's narrator and ruler of the skycity Bhujerba; Reddas, a sky pirate based in the port at Balfonheim; and the Rozarrian Empire, of which Al-Cid Margrace is a prince of the ruling family.

5|$|When {{not in a}} dungeon, Link {{explores the}} overworld. In Seasons, the overworld {{consists}} of Holodrum and the subterranean world of Subrosia. The two worlds are linked by several portals. <b>In</b> <b>Ages,</b> Link travels between present-day Labrynna and the past, connected by Time Holes. In either game, some areas of one world are accessible only from portals from the other and vice versa. Holodrum, Subrosia, and Labrynna contain optional side quests and upgrades for Link and his equipment. One such side quest is ring collection; rings provide Link with various bonuses and abilities, such as improved defense. Some rings {{do not have any}} practical uses, e.g. rings that weaken Link's attack or defense, or transform Link into an enemy creature, or are awarded when certain criteria are met but do not have any effect. Another side quest is the optional trading game, in which Link receives and delivers special items to certain people throughout the land. Once completed, Link receives an upgraded sword.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} of Oracle of Seasons and Ages {{is similar}} to that of , copying basic controls, graphics, and sounds from the Game Boy title. Like most The Legend of Zelda titles, exploration and combat take place from an overhead perspective. Link uses a sword for his primary attack, complemented by secondary weapons and items. Basic items, such as bombs and a boomerang, are common to both games. Some new items are exclusive to one game, usually with a counterpart in the other, with similar uses (e.g. the slingshot in Seasons and the seed shooter <b>in</b> <b>Ages</b> both shoot seeds, while the magnetic gloves in Seasons and the switch hook <b>in</b> <b>Ages</b> are used to access otherwise unreachable areas via special targets). [...] Unlike most Zelda titles, a sword and shield is not always equipped when the player possesses them; they can be assigned like any other item into either of two available slots. Most of each of the games is spent finding the eight Essences (Essences of Nature in Seasons and Essences of Time <b>in</b> <b>Ages),</b> each hidden in a dungeon—a large, usually underground, area containing enemies and puzzles.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate participation and performance trends of age group triathletes competing in the Olympic distance triathlon at the International Triathlon Union (ITU) World Championships 2009 - 2014. During this period, the number of participants remained constant. Swimming performance improved <b>in</b> athletes <b>in</b> <b>age</b> groups 25 - 29 years to 55 - 59 years, but not in younger (18 - 24 years) and older (> 60 - 64 years) age groups.

Cohort turnover is defined by the difference between the numbers of young people entering and older people leaving the working ages.

40|$|SummaryThe {{combination}} {{of depression and}} anorexia may influence morbidity and progressive physical disability in the elderly. Gender differences exist in hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activation following stress exposure. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate gender differences in feeding behavior under novelty stress <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> mice. Food intake measurement, immunohistochemical assessment, and mRNA expression analysis were conducted to investigate the role of serotonin 2 C receptor (5 -HT 2 CR) and its relationship with ghrelin in stress-induced suppression of feeding behavior <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> mice. After exposure to novelty stress, a 21 -fold increase in plasma corticosterone and remarkable suppression of food intake were observed <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> male mice. Furthermore, a 5 -HT 2 CR agonist suppressed food intake <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> male mice. Novelty stress induced a 7 -fold increase in 5 -HT 2 CR and c-Fos co-expressing cells in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> male mice but caused no change <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> female mice. Plasma acylated ghrelin levels decreased <b>in</b> stressed <b>aged</b> male mice and administration of the 5 -HT 2 CR antagonist inhibited this decrease. The 5 -HT 2 CR antagonist also reversed the suppression of food intake in estrogen receptor α agonist-treated aged male mice. Therefore, conspicuously suppressed feeding behavior <b>in</b> novelty stress-exposed <b>aged</b> male mice may be mediated by 5 -HT 2 CR hypersensitivity, leading to hypoghrelinemia. The hypersensitivity may partly be due to estrogen receptor activation <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> male mice...|$|R

30|$|A second {{important}} {{finding was}} that athletes <b>in</b> all <b>age</b> groups improved performance {{with the exception of}} female 100 km ultra-marathoners <b>in</b> <b>age</b> group 25 – 29 years. There was a non-linear increase in running speed in female 100 km ultra-marathoners <b>in</b> <b>age</b> groups 30 – 34 to 60 – 64 years, in male 100 km ultra-marathoners <b>in</b> <b>age</b> groups 18 – 24 to 60 – 64 years, in female 100 miles ultra-marathoners <b>in</b> <b>age</b> groups 35 – 39 to 45 – 49 years and in male 100 miles ultra-marathoners <b>in</b> <b>age</b> groups 25 – 29 to 45 – 49 years. In contrast, a linear increase in running speed was found for female 100 km ultra-marathoners <b>in</b> <b>age</b> group 60 – 64 years, for male 100 km ultra-marathoners <b>in</b> <b>age</b> groups 65 – 69 to 75 – 79 years, in female 100 miles ultra-marathoners <b>in</b> <b>age</b> groups 25 – 29, 30 – 34, 50 – 54 and 55 – 59 years and in male 100 miles ultra-marathoners <b>in</b> <b>age</b> groups 18 – 24, and 50 – 54 to 65 – 69 years. A non-linear increase in running speed suggests that athletes <b>in</b> these <b>age</b> groups seemed to have reached their limits in running performance. In 100 km races, more age groups showed a non-linear increase in running speed than in 100 miles races. Therefore, 100 km ultra-marathoners seemed rather to have reached their limits in running speed compared to 100 miles ultra-marathoners. On the other side, 100 miles age group ultra-marathoners seemed to have still the possibility to improve their performance in the future due to the linear increase in running speed. This seems especially to be true for younger age group athletes (i.e. 18 – 24 years in men and 25 – 34 years in women) and older age group athletes (i.e. older than 50 years for both women and men).|$|R
