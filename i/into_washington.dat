5|$|After exiting Herkimer, NY5 {{continues}} east, closely paralleling {{this time}} the canal, through the city of Little Falls as Main Street, where two more concurrencies occur, with NY167 and NY169. NY5 continues to parallel the canal, {{and in some instances}} again, the Thruway, through Amsterdam, becoming Amsterdam Road all the way to Scotia, where it crosses the canal into Schenectady as Mohawk Avenue, turning into State Street upon entering the city limits. It continues fairly straight on a southeast course into Albany as Central Avenue until it reaches Townsend Park. At this point, NY5 turns <b>into</b> <b>Washington</b> Avenue and all signage referring to NY5 ceases. The New York State Department of Transportation recognizes the route, however, as it continues down Washington Ave past the New York State Capitol building, turning south for a short distance as Eagle Street. NY5 then continues east on State Street to Broadway, where it again turns south east shortly before returning east on a small spur of Broadway, traveling underneath US9 and I-787. NY5 ends at the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|M-13/M-84 {{crosses the}} west channel of the Saginaw River near the Ted Putz Nature Area to Middle Ground island.

5|$|MD 704 {{was named}} for George N. Palmer, a banker and {{community}} leader in Seat Pleasant, by 1951. John Hanson Highway was constructed from US 301 in Bowie west to MD 704 between 1954 and 1957. MD 704 was expanded to a divided highway through the highway's interchange with the freeway {{as part of the}} construction. In addition to the current set of ramps, the interchange included loop ramps from westbound MD 704 to the eastbound freeway and from the westbound freeway to westbound MD 704. By 1958, the portion of MD 704 south of the freeway was marked as Temporary US 50. This temporary route extended west <b>into</b> <b>Washington</b> along newly completed East Capitol Street and the pair of Independence Avenue and Constitution Avenue to reconnect with US 50 at 2nd Street in Capitol Hill. US 50 remained along Defense Highway (now MD 450) from Bowie to Bladensburg and on Bladensburg Road and Maryland Avenue within the city until 1962, when the U.S. Highway was placed along the newly completed John Hanson Highway from Bowie to Washington and Temporary US 50 was removed from MD 704.|$|E

Route 57 heads into farmland with intermittent residences, crossing into Franklin Township. The route continues to New Village, where residences become more dense. A short distance after the intersection with County Route 633 (Edison Road), Route 57 heads back into farm fields. The road reaches the residential community of Broadway, where it comes to a junction with County Route 643 (Asbury Broadway Road). Route 57 continues through agricultural areas with more residences and businesses, crossing <b>into</b> <b>Washington</b> Township, where it intersects County Route 648 (Little Philadelphia Road) and County Route 623 (Brass Castle Road).|$|E
5|$|Scattered fisher populations now {{exist in}} the Pacific Northwest. In 1961, fishers from British Columbia and Minnesota were re-introduced in Oregon to the {{southern}} Cascades near Klamath Falls and also to the Wallowa Mountains near La Grande. From 1977–1980, fishers {{were introduced to the}} region around Crater Lake. Starting in January 2008, fishers were reintroduced <b>into</b> <b>Washington</b> State. The initial reintroduction was on the Olympic peninsula (90 animals), with subsequent reintroductions into the south Cascade mountains. The reintroduced animals are monitored by radio collars and remote cameras, and {{have been shown to be}} reproducing. From 2008 to 2011, about 40 fishers were re-introduced in the northern Sierra Nevada near Stirling City, complementing fisher populations in Yosemite National Park and along California's northern boundary between the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Klamath Mountains. Fishers are a protected species in Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming. In Idaho and California, fishers are protected through a closed trapping season, but they are not afforded any specific protection; however, in California the fisher has been granted threatened status under the Endangered Species Act. In June 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recommended that fishers be removed from the endangered list in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. It also recommended further study to ensure that current populations are managed properly.|$|E
5|$|MD 5 was {{designated}} in 1927 {{to run from}} Point Lookout to the Washington, D.C. border in Suitland. The route was realigned to follow Naylor Road to the Washington, D.C. line in 1939, while MD 637 {{was designated}} along the portion of Branch Avenue leading to the border. Between 1939 and 1949, the route continued <b>into</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. as District of Columbia Route 5 (DC 5), which followed Naylor Road, Good Hope Road, 11th Street SE, and DC 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue) to US 1 and US 240 near the White House. MD 5 was realigned {{to head to the}} Washington, D.C. border along Branch Avenue in 1950. During the course of the 1950s and 1960s, most of MD 5 between the MD 235 intersection and the Washington, D.C. border was widened into a divided highway. In 1993, the route bypassed Leonardtown; the original alignment was designated MD 5 Business (MD 5 Bus.) before it was decommissioned in 2012. In 1997, MD 5 was realigned to bypass Waldorf to the east along what had been designated as MD 205 in 1989. The former alignment through Waldorf followed what is now MD 5 Bus. and US 301. In Prince George's County, multiple interchanges were built along MD 5 between MD 223 and the Capital Beltway in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2007, a four-lane, divided bypass of Hughesville was completed, alleviating the traffic bottleneck within that town at the intersection of MD 231. The former alignment through Hughesville became MD 5 Bus. The portion of MD 5 between US 301 and the Capital Beltway is slated to be upgraded to a full freeway, with an interchange at MD 373 (Accokeek Road)/Brandywine Road planned and the remainder still in the planning stages.|$|E
