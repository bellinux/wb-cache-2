500|$|As {{a result}} of World War II in the 1940s, Asch and other social psychologists were {{interested}} in propaganda. They wondered: <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> people to believe what {{you want them to}} believe? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> people to believe they should sacrifice for the war effort? ...|$|E
500|$|Producer David Amann {{explained}} that {{the inspiration for the}} story was [...] "What if you have a doctor who is prosperous but has a dark page from his past that comes back to haunt him?" [...] Spotnitz later elaborated that the story initially was [...] "going to be <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> rid of something you can't get rid of". However, the writers soon found this storyline difficult to develop, and, by Spotnitz's own admission, the story [...] "started to evolve into a Cape Fear type of situation". The episode was finished by the writers over the Christmas break and then [...] "handed over" [...] to Kim Manners, who became the episode's director.|$|E

500|$|... "The hope, {{first and}} foremost, {{was to put}} this on people’s radar. Apart from the UN and a few newsreaders who mention this every year, people don’t even know this day exists. It’s also to make people realize it’s not just about {{volunteering}} to go {{and live in the}} Congo for four years. It’s as much about working a soup kitchen as it is helping an elderly person. Contributing something positive doesn’t have to be a lifelong commitment; it can just be daily gestures. So, it was about giving the whole issue perspective... One video and a message aren't going to save everything. But when you say things together, maybe the message will be heard and hopefully will provoke action. Inherently people are good, and inherently people are distracted and somewhat lazy, so it comes down to <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> people’s attention." ...|$|E
500|$|Games in the Guitar Hero series {{have been}} {{generally}} well received by critics. The initial games were highly praised by reviewers. Neversoft's first {{entry to the}} series, Guitar Hero III, {{was considered to be}} too difficult, with many difficult songs presenting players with [...] "walls of notes"; the developers later acknowledged this. Subsequent efforts in Guitar Hero: Aerosmith and Guitar Hero World Tour were seen to have some improvements, with Guitar Hero: Metallica considered to be a well-polished title and, at that time, the best Guitar Hero title Neversoft has produced. Guitar Hero 5s improvements toward social gameplay were complemented by reviewers and considered a further improvement upon the series. Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "An addictive videogame provides the illusion of musical mastery for even the least gifted:. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to Carnegie Hall? Tap, tap, tap." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the industry newsletter [...] "The Jack Myers Report" [...] harshly criticized ABC for selling the doll, and other news outlets reported the snafu. [...] Bob Tedeschi of The New York Times stated, [...] "In the charge toward e-commerce revenues, ABC learned a useful lesson last week: Don't try to sell cuddly rag dolls depicting homicidal rapists". Angela Shapiro, president of ABC, said, [...] "I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. I should have been sensitive {{to the history of}} the character and I wasn't". Another ABC executive stated, [...] "We didn't exercise proper sensitivity to the history of the character of Todd. [...] We have re-evaluated and decided not to sell the doll". [...] A doll of Todd's daughter, Starr, remained in ABC stores. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times commented, [...] "I suppose ABC didn't have much of a choice but to pull the product--but I have to wonder about the people who voiced those protests." [...] He added, [...] "It was a stupid SOCK DOLL based on a SOAP OPERA CHARACTER. If you're offended by that, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> through the day without succumbing to fits of hysterical outrage every five minutes?" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Three Men and Adena" [...] {{marked the}} {{conclusion}} of the Adena Watson murder case, a story arc which began {{at the start of the}} first season. The Watson case was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book that served as the basis of the Homicide series. Elements of the interview in [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] were incorporated from real-life police interrogations in that case. The Wallace case was never solved, and Fontana insisted that the Watson case in Homicide remain unsolved as well, despite pressure from NBC for a more satisfying conclusion. Fontana said, [...] "We never solved it because we felt that it would be a disservice to the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that no one took responsibility." [...] The scene when Tucker admits for a moment he is not sure in his own mind that he didn't commit the murder was inspired by a similar real-life interaction Fontana found in a police interrogation transcript during his research. Fontana said, [...] "It was so chilling (and) I was like, 'Oh man, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> there?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E
500|$|Cross, a {{resolute}} Christian, {{converted to}} Christianity while {{on leave from}} a posting to Cyprus in 1981. He visited Jerusalem over the Easter weekend and {{was inspired by a}} retired British Army officer he met there to convert. After converting, he considered leaving the Army, but has said in interviews that he reconciled his beliefs with his military service, contending that [...] "the British Army as a community [...] recognises the issue of spirituality and goodness and righteousness and justice and evil and wrong probably far more than most". He is a licensed lay reader in the Church of England and has involvement with a number of Christian organisations, including as a trustee of the British and Foreign Bible Society and {{a former president of the}} Armed Forces Christian Union. In an interview for the Christian Broadcasting Network in 2009, he said [...] "The moral component of fighting power is about leadership, it's about ethics, it's about culture, it's about <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> people to fight and embedded within that is an element of justice and righteousness. f you lose the moral component, you lose everything. I think we – collectively in the West – have gone through 30 - 40 years really of pretending that this moral component is not important, and that I don't need to have a biblical foundation in my life. And I challenge that." [...] He has written on the subject in the British Army Review, an in house publication aimed at generating professional debate, where he described ideas of a secular Army as 'tripe' and 'dangerously wrong' and the rewrite of the motto of the Girl Guides, removing reference to God, as 'vapid and anodyne'.|$|E

2500|$|The Gamemakers' control center, {{about which}} Katniss can only {{speculate}} in the novel, was also developed as a location, helping to remind the audience of the artificial nature of the arena. Ross commented, [...] "so much of the film happens in the woods that it's easy to forget this is a futuristic society, manipulating these events {{for the sake of}} an audience. The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room." [...] Ross and visual effects supervisor Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal dei ex machina Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that [...] "we really didn't want to have to explain things... <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> compelled by these [...] that just appear {{at the end of the}} movie? We wanted to find a way to introduce them without having to explain specifically and exactly what they were and the game room was a really great opportunity for us to be able to do that." ...|$|E
