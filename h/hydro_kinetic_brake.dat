40|$|The growing {{issues of}} energy {{shortage}} {{and the environmental}} crisis has resulted in new challenges for the automotive industry. Conventional commercial vehicles, such as refuse trucks and delivery vehicles, consume significantly more energy than other on-road vehicles since they have the characteristic of frequent start/stop with high moment of inertia and drive at low speeds on designated city routes. It is important to make these vehicles more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly. The hybrid commercial vehicle is a promising solution to reduce emissions and to meet the future vehicle emission standard since it is generally equipped with braking energy regeneration systems to recover the kinematic loss from frequent braking. This paper introduces a type of all-wheel drive hybrid concept suggested by Dr. Leo Oriet; the new concept allows commercial vehicles {{to have a significant}} improvement in <b>kinetic</b> <b>braking</b> energy recovery without sacrificing braking safety.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} load {{control of a}} marine current energy {{converter}} using a vertical axis turbine mounted on a permanent magnet synchronous generator. The purpose of this thesis is to show the work done in the so far relatively uncharted territory of control systems for <b>hydro</b> <b>kinetic</b> energy conversion. The work is in its early stage and is meant {{to serve as a}} guide forfuture development of the control system. An experimental power station has been deployed and the first results are presented. A comparison between three load control methods has been made; a fixedAC load, a fixed pulse width modulated DC load and a DC bus voltage control of a DC load. Experimental results show that the DC bus voltage control reduces the variation of rotational speed with a factor of 3. 5. For all three cases, the tip speed ratio of the turbine can be kept close to the expected optimal tip speed ratio. However, for all three cases the average extracted power was significantly lower than the average power available in the turbine times the estimated maximum power coefficient. A maximum power point tracking system, with or without water velocity measurement, should increase the average extracted power. A simulation model has been validated using experimental data. The simulated system consists of the electrical system and a hydrodynamic vortex model for the turbine. Experiments of no load operation were conducted to calibrate the drag losses of the turbine. Simulations were able to predict the behaviour in a step response for a change in tip speed ratio when the turbine was operated close to optimal tip speed ratio. The start position of the turbine was varied in the simulation to view the influence on the step response from a changed turbine position relative to the direction of the water flow.

The Marrowstone Island site is a potential location for installing MHK devices because the tidal currents observed that are sufficient for power generation. In order to quantify the effects of turbulence on MHK devices and the surrounding environment at this site, a prelimi- nary fluid flow field study was conducted here by the Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) in collaboration with the Applied Physics Lab at the University of Washington (APL-UW). This study entailed continuous The Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV), Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) measurements from May 4, 2010 to May 22, 2010, in order to obtain information about turbulence effects during different tidal conditions. The instruments used for collecting the above measurements were deployed at the Marrowstone site using a R/V Jack Robertson provided by the University of Washington (APL-UW). All the measurements were taken at the site with an average depth of 22 m below the sea surface. ADV acquired velocity data at 32 Hz sampling frequency at 4. 6 m above the seabed, and ADCP acquired velocity profile data at a sampling frequency of 2 Hz, from a height of 2. 6 m above the seabed to the surface with a bin resolution of 0. 5 m. The ADV and ADCP measurements showed that the horizontal velocity had a turbulence intensity of 10 %. Further- more, the spectral analysis from ADV measurements showed that the flow is fully turbulent with - 5 / 3 slope in the inertial sub-range of the spectra.
