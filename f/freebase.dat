25|$|DMT is {{commonly}} handled and stored as a fumarate, as other DMT acid salts are extremely hygroscopic {{and will not}} readily crystallize. Its <b>freebase</b> form, although less stable than DMT fumarate, is favored by recreational users choosing to vaporize the chemical as it has a lower boiling point. In contrast to DMT's base, its salts are water-soluble. DMT in solution degrades relatively quickly if not stored protected from air, light, and heat in a freezer.|$|E

25|$|A {{more refined}} method for {{creating}} Cheese heroin {{is done by}} taking #4 powder heroin and crushed diphenhydramine tablets, and adding them to water such that the active ingredients dissolve into the solution. The solution is then filtered via a micron filter to remove all the cuts and binders/fillers, leaving the user with a solution of high purity diamorphine HCl and diphenhydramine hcl. The water is then evaporated off, yielding a clumpy powder containing a highly purified mixture of heroin and DPH. It can also be further purified by titrating the solution with a weak to intermediate base such as sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide to <b>freebase</b> the diamorphine and DPH.|$|E
2500|$|Methcathinone as {{free base}} is very unstable; it easily loses its ketone group, which is {{substituted}} with a hydroxyl group [...] Structurally, this {{occurs when the}} C=O bond at the Rβ-position is converted into a C-OH bond. Additionally, a dimerization reaction has been observed in solutions of <b>freebase</b> methcathinone, which yields a biologically inactive compound. In other words, basic methcathinone will turn into (& also metabolize to) pseudoephedrine, from which it was synthesized.|$|E

The most commonly used are the hydrochloride (<b>freebase</b> conversion ratio 0.805), phosphate (0.736), sulphate (0.859), and citrate (0.842). Others include a salicylate NSAID, codeine salicylate (0.686), a bromide (codeine methylbromide, 0.759), and at least four codeine-based barbiturates, the cyclohexenylethylbarbiturate (0.559), cyclopentenylallylbarbiturate (0.561), diallylbarbiturate (0.561), and diethylbarbiturate (0.619). The latter was introduced as Codeonal in 1912, indicated for pain with nervousness. [...] Codeine methylbromide is also considered a separate drug for various purposes.|$|E

2500|$|Prenatal cocaine {{exposure}} (PCE), theorized in the 1970s, {{occurs when}} a pregnant woman uses cocaine and thereby exposes her fetus to the drug. [...] "Crack baby" [...] was a term coined to describe children {{who were exposed to}} crack (<b>freebase</b> cocaine in smokable form) as fetuses; the concept of the crack baby emerged in the US during the 1980s and 1990s {{in the midst of a}} crack epidemic. Other terms are [...] "cocaine baby" [...] and [...] "crack kid". [...] Early studies reported that people who had been exposed to crack in utero would be severely emotionally, mentally, and physically disabled; this belief became common in the scientific and lay communities. Fears were widespread that a generation of crack babies were going to put severe strain on society and social services as they grew up. Later studies failed to substantiate the findings of earlier ones that PCE has severe disabling consequences; these earlier studies had been methodologically flawed (e.g. with small sample sizes and confounding factors). Scientists have come to understand that the findings of the early studies were vastly overstated and that most people who were exposed to cocaine in utero do not have disabilities.|$|E

50|$|<b>Freebase</b> ran on a {{database}} infrastructure created in-house by Metaweb that used a graph model: Instead of using tables and keys to define data structures, <b>Freebase</b> defined its data structure {{as a set}} of nodes and a set of links that established relationships between the nodes. Because its data structure was non-hierarchical, <b>Freebase</b> could model much more complex relationships between individual elements than a conventional database, and it was open for users to enter new objects and relationships into the underlying graph. Queries to the database were made in Metaweb Query Language (MQL) and served by a triplestore called graphd.|$|E
5000|$|In this manner, <b>Freebase</b> {{differed}} from the wiki model in many ways. Users could create their own types, but these types were not adopted in the [...] "public commons" [...] until promoted by a Metaweb employee. As well, users could not modify each other's types. The reason <b>Freebase</b> could not open up permissions of schemas is that external applications relied on them; thus, changing a type's schema - for instance by deleting a property or changing a simple property - might have broken queries for API users and even within <b>Freebase</b> itself, in saved views, for example.|$|E
50|$|By 1978, Holmes was {{reputed to}} be earning as much as $3,000 per day as a porn performer.

Professionally, it affected his ability to maintain an erection, as is apparent from his flaccid performance in Insatiable (1980). To support himself and his drug habit, Holmes ventured into crime, selling drugs for gangs, prostituting himself to both men and women, as well as committing credit card fraud and various acts of petty theft.|$|R

Nussbaum remained alone with the dying child for roughly ten hours, failing to notify police or medical personnel. Steinberg departed and returned several times, sometimes <b>freebasing</b> cocaine. According to initial police reports, Nussbaum didn't notify authorities because she believed Steinberg had supernatural healing powers. At roughly 6.00 a.m. the next morning, Lisa stopped breathing. Shortly thereafter, Steinberg telephoned 911 at Nussbaum's urging.|$|R
