40|$|System <b>identification</b> <b>procedures</b> {{offer the}} {{possibility}} to correct erroneous models, based on measurement data. Recently, this conventional field of application is being extended to fault detection and system diagnosis. In contrast to conventional approaches, <b>identification</b> <b>procedures</b> try to establish an unequivocal relation in between the damage and specific mechanical parameters, based on a suitable model. Furthermore, they can be employed during normal operation of the machinery. In this paper, several <b>identification</b> <b>procedures</b> {{on the basis of}} the Extended Kalman Filter are introduced and employed for model-based fault detection. Their feasability is proved by several examples. First, it is shown that the crack depth of a simulated Jeffcott-rotor can be calculated correctly. Then, the procedures are utilized to determine the crack depth of a rotor test rig. Finally, it is proved that <b>identification</b> <b>procedures</b> can be employed for the determination of unbalances without having to apply test masses...|$|R
30|$|Lampinen’s (2016) {{second major}} claim is that ROCs invite {{comparison}} of memory accuracy across {{different levels of}} confidence. As an example, he selects a particular false alarm rate, say, 0.167 (see Lampinen, 2016, Fig.  6), and then observes that the hit rates vary for different simulated <b>identification</b> <b>procedures,</b> suggesting that different estimates of accuracy (say, d′) would be observed for lineup and showup identifications. Finally, Lampinen notes that if response bias differs across <b>identification</b> <b>procedures,</b> then the operating points being compared may reflect different degrees of witness confidence. Conversely, Levi (2016) worries that witnesses given different <b>identification</b> <b>procedures</b> may respond with the same confidence level despite having different discrimination accuracy (d′).|$|R

40|$|Non-linear {{control is}} common in industry. Indeed, {{there is a growing}} use of {{constrained}} model predictive control methods, which are inherently nonlinear. This means that it is not feasible to directly apply traditional indirect <b>identification</b> <b>procedures</b> which assume that the control law is linear. In this paper, we address this problem by using a virtual closed loop where the virtual controller is chosen to be linear irrespective of the linearity of the true controller.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} effect of high-and low-similarity {{composites}} on identification accuracy, using both lineups and showups.

There was also no evidence that showups were less accurate <b>identification</b> <b>procedures</b> than lineups, across composition conditions. In fact, in perpetrator absent situations, showups were better <b>identification</b> <b>procedures</b> than lineups in terms of accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Tremor is an {{involuntary}} motion {{which is a}} common complication of Parkinson?s disease and Multiple Sclerosis. A promising treatment is to artificially contract the muscle through application of induced electrical stimulation. However, existing controllers have either provided only modest levels of suppression or have been applied only in simulation. To enable more advanced, model-based control schemes, an accurate model of the relevant limb dynamics is required, together with <b>identification</b> <b>procedures</b> that are suitable for clinical application. This paper proposes such a solution, explicitly addressing limitations of existing methodologies. These include model structures that (i) neglect critical features, and (ii) restrict the range of admissible control schemes, together with <b>identification</b> <b>procedures</b> that (iii) employ stimulation inputs that are uncomfortable for patients, (iv) are overly complex and time-consuming for clinical use, and (v) cannot be automated. Experimental results confirm {{the efficacy of the}} proposed <b>identification</b> <b>procedures,</b> and show that high levels of accuracy can be achieved in a short identification time using test procedures that are suitable for future transference to the clinical domai...|$|R

50|$|The federal {{due process}} {{standard}} governing the admissibility of eyewitness evidence is {{set forth in}} the U.S. Supreme Court case of Manson v. Brathwaite. Under the federal standard, if an <b>identification</b> <b>procedure</b> is shown to be unnecessarily suggestive, the court must consider whether certain independent indicia of reliability are present, and if so, weigh those factors against the corrupting effect of the flawed police procedure. Within that framework, the court should determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the identification appears to be reliable. If not, the identification evidence must be excluded from evidence under controlling federal precedent.|$|E

50|$|In {{the context}} of {{nonlinear}} system identification Jin et al. describe greybox modeling by assuming a model structure a priori and then estimating the model parameters. Parameter estimation is relatively easy if the model form is known but this is rarely the case. Alternatively the structure or model terms for both linear and highly complex nonlinear models can be identified using NARMAX methods. This approach is completely flexible {{and can be used}} with grey box models where the algorithms are primed with the known terms, or with completely black box models where the model terms are selected as part of the <b>identification</b> <b>procedure.</b> Another advantage of this approach is that the algorithms will just select linear terms if the system under study is linear, and nonlinear terms if the system is nonlinear, which allows a great deal of flexibility in the identification.|$|E
