40|$|Toronto Public Health led {{a review}} of Toronto’s <b>idling</b> <b>control</b> bylaw to {{determine}} {{how it could be}} improved. The review considered the benefits of reducing idling of vehicles, <b>idling</b> <b>control</b> bylaws in other jurisdictions, reasons why people idle, and information gathered during stakeholder consultations. Consultation with stakeholders indicated that the bylaw could be more effective if it was easier to understand and easier for the City to enforce. Suggestions for improvement included decreasing the allowed idling time, clarifying the language in the bylaw, removing some of the exemptions, and strengthening enforcement. Reducing permitted idling time from three minutes to one minute would reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants, and make the bylaw easier to enforce. A revised bylaw would also offer the opportunity to renew efforts to reduce idling in Toronto. Education and outreach could increase public knowledge about the impact of idling on greenhouse gas emissions and target specific areas or sectors which are a consistent source of complaints. This report updates a report that was on the November 2009 Board of Health agenda by responding to the Board of Health’s request for additional information about enforcing the bylaw...|$|E

40|$|The goal of an <b>idle</b> <b>control</b> for {{automotive}} engines is {{to maintain}} the engine speed within a given range, robustly with respect to load torque disturbances acting on the crankshaft.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel DC-DC {{converter}} topology {{to achieve an}} ultra-high step-up ratio while maintaining a high conversion efficiency. It adopts a three degree of freedom (3 DoF) approach in the circuit design. It also demonstrates {{the flexibility of the}} proposed converter to combine with the features of modularity, electrical isolation, soft-switching, low voltage stress on switching devices, and is thus considered to be an improved topology over traditional DC-DC converters. New control strategies including the two-section output voltage <b>control</b> and cell <b>idle</b> <b>control</b> are also developed to improve the converter performance. With the cell <b>idle</b> <b>control,</b> the secondary winding inductance of the idle module is bypassed to decrease its power loss. A 400 -W DC-DC converter is prototyped and tested to verify the proposed techniques, in addition to a simulation study. The step-up conversion ratio can reach 1 : 14 with a peak efficiency of 94 % and the proposed techniques can be applied {{to a wide range of}} high voltage and high power distributed generation and DC power transmission...|$|R

This paper applies a recently proposed linear time varying model predictive approach for the <b>idle</b> speed <b>control</b> of ultra-lean burn internal combustion engines. Unlike conventional gasoline engines, the approach uses fuel flow as the primary control variable to compensate for sudden fluctuations in engine load resulting in a fuel assisted <b>idle</b> speed <b>control</b> strategy. Simultaneously, the spark angle is maintained at a value so as to yield maximum brake torque while the emissions are reduced to negligibly low levels by constraining the engine operation to ultra-lean burn mode.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>idle</b> speed <b>control</b> of hydrogen fueled internal combustion engine (H 2 ICE) using model predictive control (MPC) and sampled data control (SDC) theories. In the first step, results from SDC theory and a version of MPC are collectively employed to obtain a rigorously developed new generic control strategy. Here, a controller, based on a family of approximate discrete time models, is designed within a previously proposed framework to have guaranteed practical asymptotic stability of the exact (unknown) discrete time model. Controller design, accomplished using MPC theory, is facilitated by successive online linearizations of the nonlinear discrete time model at each sampling instant. In the second step, the technique is implemented in the <b>idle</b> speed <b>control</b> of hydrogen internal combustion engine (H 2 ICE). Various conditions under which this theory can be implemented are presented and their validity for <b>idle</b> speed <b>control</b> problem are discussed.
