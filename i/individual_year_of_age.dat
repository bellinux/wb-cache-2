50|$|In the United States, {{chemical}} eye injuries {{most commonly}} occur among working-age adults. A 2016 analysis of emergency department visits from 2010-2013 reported over 36,000 visits annually for chemical burns to the eye, {{with a median}} age at presentation of 32 years. By <b>individual</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> 1- and 2-year-old children have the highest incidence of these injuries, with rates approximately 50% higher than the highest-risk adult group (25 years), and 13 {{times higher than the}} rate among 7-year-olds.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{crossing}} the body midline {{on the lower}} extremities <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> 65 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> and older was investigated. Methods. The subjects were 10 individuals 65 – 79 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> 10 <b>individuals</b> 80 <b>years</b> and older, and 10 individuals 20 – 35 years. The total testing phase consisted of 2 sets of 30 trials per leg on 2 days. The subjects performed trials that involved movements ipsilaterally, contralaterally, and {{directly in front of}} the anterior superior iliac crest of the leg being tested. Reaction time and movement time scores were recorded. Results. <b>Individuals</b> 65 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> and older were found to exhibit slower reaction times to movements in a con-tralateral direction when compared with movements made in the ipsilateral direction whereas <b>individuals</b> 80 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> and older were also found to exhibit slower reaction times to movements in a contralateral direction when compared with movements made in the midline and ipsilateral direction. Conclusions. These findings indicate that the effects of midline-crossing inhibition on the lower extremities re-emerge in <b>individuals</b> 65 <b>years</b> and older, whereas in early development this effect disappears by 8 or 9 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>age...</b>|$|R
