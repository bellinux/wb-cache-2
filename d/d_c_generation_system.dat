The C system has two distinguishing characteristics. First, its navigation and referring strategies {{are based on the}} area visible to the player, making the system independent of GIVE’s internal representation of areas (such as rooms). As a result, the system portability to other virtual environments is enhanced. Second, the system adapts classical grounding models to the task of instruction giving in virtual worlds.

40|$|Abstract- A 256 x 256 pixel, {{full frame}} CCDimage sensor has been {{developed}} that incorporates on-chip <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> bias <b>generation</b> and clocking. Using a small pixel pitch of 10 im (V) by 10 im (H), these features allow the array to be packaged into very small dimensions with a total pin count of seven pins. By virtue of the three phase architecture, the full well storage capacity can be increased with surface channel operation, maximizing resolution under conditions of low scene contrast. In addition, a modified technique of surface recombination is used to provide blooming suppression. Together, these features make it well suited for applications which require a high performance miniature sensor. I...|$|R
40|$|The superconducting a. c. {{generator}} {{is expected}} to be the optimum choice among a. <b>c.</b> <b>generation</b> <b>systems</b> in future because of its reduced size, high efficiency, high terminal voltage and its contribution to the stability of the power system. Such machines also exhibit unique design problems which remain unsolved. The optimal selection of the basic design parameters is a current problem of interest. This thesis is intended as a contribution in this direction, and a general design strategy has been developed for the superconducting a. c. generator. Elements of the design process include magnetic field analysis, losses, and mechanical performance all which of are discussed in the thesis. An analytical model has been developed to help determine the distribution of magnetic flux density inside the superconducting machine. This model takes into account the number, and the geometric structure, of the winding slots and allows the rotor of the superconducting machine to be designed with optimum magnetic field distribution. A general design strategy has been developed for the superconducting a. c. generator rotor for predicting the optimum design. The design optimization process incorporates "direct search" and random-shrinkage methods. Two direct search methods of minimization have been compared on mathematical functions and also on machine design problems. The best method is highlighted and discussed. A general computer program package is presented that will optimize and analyse machine design problems. The package is organised in such away that future addition or deletion of performance specifications, constraints, optimization methods and design process elements are readily implemented...|$|R

It removes significant human {{effort by}} automatically mapping algorithms to hardware, providing a valuable design assist to software-oriented developers. To enable accessibility and easiness of hardware design space exploration (DSE), HercuLeS overcomes limitations of known work: non-standard source languages, insufficient representations,maintenancedifficulties,necessityofcodetemplates, lackofusageparadigmsandvendor-dependence.

A metallic titanium target was reactively sputtered {{in a mixture}} of argon and oxygen. The influence of smooth <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> and pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> discharge power on films thickness, crystallinity, surface morphology, photocatalytic activity (methylene blue degradation) and hydrophilic activity were studied. At pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> sputtering, plasma generator has been used to provide the asymmetric pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> bias of the target at 100 kHz and pulsed off-time 4016 ns. The structures of the films at 100 nm and 300 nm thick showed nano-grain size structure. The pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode deposition exhibited a considerably lower surface roughness, but higher grain size compared to the films deposited with the smooth <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode. At film thickness about 300 nm, the XRD peaks indicated that the dominant structure was anatase for which the preferred orientation was in (101) plane. It did not show any definite change of phase between the films deposited in the smooth <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode and the film deposited in the pulse <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode. For the photocatalytic activity, it was clearly seen that the films deposited by smooth <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode showed a higher photocatalytic activity. The hydrophilic activity test, after the films had been irradiated by an ultraviolet light source for 30 min., the smooth <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode films (thickness 300 nm) showed that a water contact angle can be less than 10 °.

40|$|Abstract. On each nonreflexive Banach space X {{there exists}} a {{positive}} continuous convex function f such that 1 /f is not a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function (i. e., a difference of two continuous convex functions). This result together with known ones implies that X is reflexive {{if and only if}} each everywhere defined quotient of two continuous convex functions is a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function. Our construction gives also a stronger version of Klee’s result concerning renormings of nonreflexive spaces and non-norm-attaining functionals. A function on a Banach space X is called a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function if it can be represented as a difference of two continuous convex functions (all functions considered in this note are realvalued). Thus the system of all <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> functions on X is the smallest vector space containing all continuous convex functions. Moreover, it is well-known, and not difficult to show, that it is even an algebra and a lattice (see, e. g., [2, III. 2]). While an everywhere defined quotient g/f of two <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> functions on a finite-dimensional Banach space is always <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> (cf. [1, Corollary]), the situation is completely different for infinite-dimensional spaces: by [7, Corollary 5. 7], on each infinite-dimensional Banach space {{there exists a}} positive <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function such that 1 /f is not <b>d.</b> <b>c...</b>|$|R
