These three-cylinder Pacifics, although capable of hauling heavy loads at high speed, had proved to be relatively maintenance-intensive, {{particularly with regard to}} the servicing of the valve gear and motion for their third (inside) cylinder. The Gresley conjugated valve <b>gear,</b> <b>driven</b> from the valve spindles of the outside cylinder piston valves, was prone to heat expansion and wear, causing timing difficulties, and required dismantling and removal whenever the centre cylinder valve required service.|$|E

40|$|Face gear {{dynamics}} {{is addressed}} by many scholars. However, dynamic behaviors of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks {{are yet to}} be investigated. Thus, in the study, a calculation solution of static transmission errors (STE) of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks is constructed, based on the proposed equivalent face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> and a four-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is formulated. The dynamic behaviors of an example case of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks are investigated. The simulation results indicate natural frequencies of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> would be decreased with pinion dedendum fatigue crack extensions; the relationship between accelerations and velocities of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> dynamic mesh forces, and vibration accelerations at bearings would also be changed. However, pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> are detected difficultly, due to simulation result similarities. Therefore, a determination solution for pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is proposed. The result shows a trend of vibration accelerations at bearings, namely, a first decreasing and then increasing tendency, which could be beneficial to detecting pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives.</b> These contributions would improve engineering applications of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> in the future...|$|R

The T-1 of 1921 had a power output of 500hp (373kW), and went into production as the T-2 in 1922 with an increase in power to 525hp (391kW). The T-3 and T-3A appeared from 1923 producing 575hp (429kW) with the final development, the T-4, producing 675hp (503kW) by December of that year. Wright attempted to build a racing version of the T rated at 700hp (522kW) to rival the Curtiss D-12, but this was not pursued.|$|E

The Southern Railway had also upgraded the permanent way on many of the former SECR routes by 1929, removing many of the weight restrictions that inspired the use of the Holcroft gear in the first place. Maunsell was therefore free to use three separate sets of Walschaerts valve <b>gear</b> <b>driven</b> by the centre driving wheels and the crank axle, a system that was easier to maintain due to the wide availability of parts.|$|E

40|$|Strength {{research}} is always {{one of the}} study focuses of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives.</b> However, a strength calculation solution, in which bending stresses, contact stresses, and bulk temperatures are included, combined with gear design standards for face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> is still not constructed due to complex face gear teeth. Thus, in this study, an equivalent face gear tooth is proposed by assessment of geometric characteristics of face gear teeth and tooth contact analysis, and a strength calculation solution of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> {{which is based on}} ISO 6336 standard associated with the proposed equivalent face gear teeth, is constructed. The fidelity of the proposed strength calculation solution of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is verified by comparing its results with the benchmark of results by finite element methods.

40|$|Face gear {{dynamics}} {{is addressed}} by many scholars. However, design solutions of low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> without <b>gear</b> tooth modifications {{are not to}} be constructed. Thus, in this study, a design solution of low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with micro-punch webs is proposed. A calculation procession of geometric parameters of micro-punch webs is constructed, an example case of a micro-punch web for a low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> is calculated, which is based on the proposed calculation procession, and the noise elimination effect of the example case is predicted. Meanwhile, the impacts of geometric parameters of micro-punch webs on sound resonant frequencies are discussed. Furthermore, an experiment of the example case is conducted to check the effect of micro-punch webs on noise reductions and the proposed calculation procession and design solution. The experimental results indicate that the noise reductions of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> can be accomplished by micro-punch webs under the almost same dynamic response conditions, and the fidelity of the proposed calculation procession of geometric parameters of micro-punch webs and design solution of low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> can be accepted.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the higher}} speed ratio and profile shifted <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> the maximum fillet {{stress in the}} pinion and the gear is not equal. The {{load-carrying}} capacity of the <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> can be improved by removing this unbalanced maximum fillet stress. This paper has explained an idea to remove this unbalanced maximum fillet stress and design the spur <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> with uniform fillet strength. This uniform fillet strength of the <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> {{can be achieved by}} changing the tooth thickness of basic racks on the pitch lines from the standard tooth thickness (0. 5 πm) in to a non-standard one (kgcπm, kgc≠ 0. 5). The influence of gear parameters such as backup ratio, cutter tip radius and addendum modification factors on the maximum fillet stress has been analyzed through FEM with different values of tooth thickness coefficient and finally the optimum value of tooth thickness coefficient are suggested for the given spur <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> that improve the fillet capacity in bending...|$|R
