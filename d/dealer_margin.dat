40|$|When retail dealers carry {{only one}} product line, {{the size of}} the <b>dealer</b> <b>margin</b> is crucial in the success of both the {{manufacturer}} and the dealer. This article proposes a successive monopoly model of patterns in exclusive dealer and manufacturer margins across a product line. The predictions of the model then are compared with the pricing practices of a major U. S. automobile manufacturer and its dealers. The data support a special case of our theory. Our analysis also indicates that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the retail demand curves for these models are (locally) linear. Finally, we use the margin data to provide updated evidence {{on the extent to which}} retail prices depart from list price. ...|$|E
40|$|Using matched {{survey and}} {{transaction}} data on 1, 500 buyers, we investigate how {{different types of}} search and purchasing behavior affect transaction prices in auto retailing. Our {{results are consistent with}} the predictions of information economics and bargaining theory. Buyers pay less if they obtain an offer from a competing dealer (0. 6 % of purchase price), if they are informed about the specific car they eventually purchase (0. 8 %), and if they are patient (0. 6 %). The combined savings of these effects equal 1 / 3 of the average <b>dealer</b> <b>margin.</b> We find that the Internet lowers prices because it informs consumers (0. 9 %), and because the referral process of online buying services helps consumers (0. 7 %). We also find that buyers who perceive themselves as vulnerable in negotiation are more likely to benefit from the Internet. Such buyers pay 1. 5 % less when they use the Internet to inform themselves, while buyers who enjoy the bargaining process do not obtain a lower price when they are informed. These results suggest that tactical decisions consumers make to improve their price negotiation outcomes have surplus redistributing effects. The result...|$|E

On February 3, 2016, Toyota {{announced that it would}} shut down the Scion brand in August 2016, with selected models to be re-branded as Toyota vehicles for the 2017 model year.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the retail}} {{currency}} exchange market, different {{buying and selling}} rates will be quoted by money dealers. Most trades are to or from the local currency. The buying rate is {{the rate at which}} money dealers will buy foreign currency, and the selling rate is the rate at which they will sell that currency. The quoted rates will incorporate an allowance for a <b>dealer's</b> <b>margin</b> (or profit) in trading, or else the margin may be recovered {{in the form of a}} commission or in some other way. Different rates may also be quoted for cash , a documentary form or electronically [...] The higher rate on documentary transactions has been justified as compensating for the additional time and cost of clearing the document. On the other hand, cash is available for resale immediately, but brings security, storage, and transportation costs, and the cost of tying up capital in a stock of banknotes (bills).|$|R
40|$|We {{characterize}} the price-transparency role of benchmarks in over-the-counter markets. A bench-mark can, under conditions, raise total social surplus {{by increasing the}} volume of beneficial trade, facilitating more efficient trade matching between dealers and customers, and reducing total search costs. Although the improvement in market transparency caused by benchmarks lowers <b>dealer</b> profit <b>margins</b> on each trade, dealers may introduce a benchmark {{in order to encourage}} greater market participation by investors. Low-cost dealers may introduce a benchmark in order to in-crease their market share through reducing entry by high-cost dealers, a further source of efficiency gain...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the attention-driven buying behavior {{of different types}} of investors. When there are many choices, options that attract attention {{are more likely to be}} considered and chosen. The data in this paper begin on December 12, 2000 and end on December 31, 2010 from Taiwan Stock Exchange. We mainly separate investors into five types, which are foreign investors, mutual fund, security <b>dealers,</b> <b>margin</b> traders and domestic others. There is the evidence of attention-buying with extreme returns. Institutional investors become net buyers of past winners, and individual investors become net buyers of past losers. Also disposition effect exists in the trading behaviors of individual investors. The performance of institutional investors is higher than individual investors. From Taiwan Stock Exchange, we find there is contagion between the stock prices of the same industry. The contagion on stock price in financial holding industry is most serious, followed by the semiconductor industry, the last for the plastic industry. 本研究以台灣股票市場 2000 年 12 月 12 日至 2010 年 12 月 31 日，上市公司的日交易資料為研究樣本，將投資人分為外資、投信、自營商、融資戶及國內其他，檢視當投資人在面臨數量龐大的選擇時，焦點事件是否可吸引投資人目光，使投資人成為股票淨買者，另外，探討投資人在面對焦點事件時的交易行為是否存在錯置效果。實證結果顯示以報酬、交易量及新聞做為焦點事件時，報酬為最能夠吸引投資人關注的因素，極端報酬成功吸引機構投資人及個別投資人的目光，致使機構投資人成為過去贏家淨買者，個別投資人成為過去輸家淨買者，且個別投資人於極端報酬時的交易行為存在錯置效果。此外，本研究以焦點事件做為研究樣本又發現，焦點事件日前後，機構投資人的投資績效優於個別投資人的投資績效。 本研究另外以台灣股票市場中之半導體產業、金融控股業及塑膠產業為研究對象，探討同產業間股價的傳染現象，發現三個產業的股價皆存在傳染現象，其中以金融控股產業的股價傳染現象最為嚴重，其次為半導體產業，最後為塑膠產業。摘要	II ABSTRACT	III 目錄	IV 表目錄	V 圖目錄	VI 第一章 緒論	 1 第一節 研究動機	 1 第二節 研究目的	 1 第二章 文獻回顧	 3 第一節 理論文獻	 3 第二節 關注效果(ATTENTION EFFECT) 	 3 第三節 錯置效果(DISPOSITION EFFECT) 	 4 第四節 傳染現象(CONTAGION) 與從眾行為(HERD BEVAVIOR) 	 5 第三章 資料來源與研究方法	 7 第一節 資料來源與樣本概述	 7 第二節 研究方法	 8 第四章 實證分析	 12 第一節 報酬	 12 第二節 交易量	 13 第三節 新聞	 14 第四節 傳染	 16 第五章 結論與建議	 19 第一節 結論	 19 第二節 建議	 20 參考文獻	 2...|$|R
50|$|By 1989, Cruddas was {{the head}} foreign {{exchange}} dealer at the City of London branch of the Jordanian-based Petra Bank. He left the same year to set up his own business, starting CMC Markets with £10,000 in the bank. Effectively a bookmaker for the City of London, it allows <b>dealers</b> to place <b>margin</b> calls on foreign currency movements. CMC Markets is currently valued at between £750 million and £1.2 billion.|$|R
40|$|We use {{computer-based}} {{simulations of}} a stock market as a background environment for experimental tests of the integration of an order-driven trading system into a dealer/quote-driven market. Experimental subjects traded using a traditional dealer quote screen (such as Nasdaq in the U. S. or the London Stock Exchange's SEAQ), to which was added a public limit order facility. Data captured on subjects' trading decisions under different market structures revealed that: (1) When available, the limit order facility {{was used by the}} subjects, attracting some orders that would have otherwise gone to dealers, and reducing investor trading costs. (2) The relative use of market orders and limit orders was related to the bid-ask spread; wider spreads (higher cost of immediate trading) led subjects to enter fewer market orders. (3) Limit order use was reduced when the dealers were provided with an "informational advantage. " (4) While the introduction of a limit order facility did not have a substantial effect on <b>dealer</b> profit <b>margins,</b> dealers' activities as a percentage of total market volume declined. Overall, we find the simulation environment is a workable device for analyzing the effect of market design changes on trader behavior and market quality. It can provide solid guidance on market structure issues, such as how best to incorporate a limit order facility in a competing dealer market. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that many durable {{products}} are sold through dealers, the literature has largely ignored the issue of how product durability affects the interactions between a manufacturer and her dealers. We seek to fill this gap by considering a durable goods manufacturer that uses independent dealers to get her product to consumers. In contrast to much of the literature, we specifically consider the possibility that if the manufacturer sells her product, then the dealers can either sell or lease it to the final consumer. One of our more interesting findings is that, when the level of competition among dealers is high, the manufacturer prefers to use a lease-brokering arrangement in which the <b>dealers</b> earn a <b>margin</b> for brokering leases between the manufacturer and end consumers, instead of selling her product to the dealers. This complements existing results that show that when suppliers of durable goods interact directly with consumers, selling is the dominant strategy for high levels of competitive intensity. channel structure, durability, time inconsistency, double marginalization, competition...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of Internet car {{referral}} services on dealer pricing of automobiles in California. Combining data from J. D. Power and Associates and Autobytel. com, a major online auto referral service, we compare online transaction prices to regular street' prices. We find that the average customer of this online service pays approximately 2 % less for her car, which corresponds to about $ 450 for the average car. Fifteen percent of the savings comes from making the purchase at a low-price dealership affiliated with the web service. The remaining 85 % of the savings seem {{to be due to}} the bargaining power of the referral service and the lower cost of serving an online consumer. Dealer price dispersion declines with online sales, indicating we are picking up more than a selection effect. Online consumers who indicate they are ready to buy in the next two days pay even lower prices. Dealers pay less for an online customer's trade-in vehicle, although on-line customers are still better off overall than offline customers. <b>Dealer</b> average gross <b>margin</b> on an online vehicle sale is lower by about $ 300 than an equivalent offline sale. However, because online consumers are cheaper to serve and online sales may be new business for the dealerships, web-affiliated dealers are likely to be better off. Consumers who use the web do better than at least 61 % of offline consumers. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{success of}} the LP12 owed {{a lot more to}} {{marketing}} and the personality of Ivor Tiefenbrun, in what is essentially a niche audiophile sector, than engineering. Support of reviewers and dealers were the overriding factors, sweeping under the carpet the deficiencies of what in essence was a flawed pirated design. The major flaws were bass bloom colouration, difficulty of setting up the deck and maintaining the optimum set up. The setting up of LP12 which go “out of tune” has become something of an industry. [...] Linn Products provided <b>dealers</b> with large <b>margins</b> as rewards for selling sufficient quantities of the deck and this discouraged comparisons with more modern and superior sounding alternatives. Reports about the practices of Linn representatives have been posted on the Internet, including tampering with a demonstration Pink Triangle at a retailer.The British hi-fi press, most notably the magazines under the Haymarket umbrella, waxed lyrical about the LP12 and would always recommended it, even in systems with budget arms, cartridges, amplifiers and speakers. The young men reviewing at the magazines were very impressionable and open to being turned to a *way* and most were converted by visits to Glasgow and the persuasions of Ivor Tiefenbrun. Once he had the industry in his grasp it was very hard for other new manufacturers to find good and responsive retailers for their products and many fine companies and products were killed off, especially in the two recessions of the early 80's and early 90's. Along with British products, high performance Japanese direct drive turntables could not get a look in. It is recognised now that many of these direct drive decks, scorned by journalists at the time, are sonically superior to the LP12.|$|R
