5|$|The {{image of}} a Wild West filled with countless gunfights was a myth {{generated}} primarily by dime-novel authors in the late 19th century. An estimate of 20,000 men in the American West were killed by gunshot between 1866 and 1900, and over 21,586 total casualties during the American Indian Wars from 1850 to 1890. The most notable and well-known {{took place in the}} states/territories of Arizona, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Actual gunfights in the Old West were very rare, very few and far between, but when gunfights did occur, the cause for each varied. Some were simply the result of the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> while others were longstanding feuds, or between bandits and lawmen. Lawless violence such as range wars like the Lincoln County War and clashes with Indians were also a cause. Some of these shootouts became famous, while others faded into history with only a few accounts surviving. To prevent gunfights from happening, many cities in the American frontier, such as Dodge City and Tombstone, put up a local ordinance to prohibit firearms in the area.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> {{determination}} <b>of</b> quality {{parameters of}} resistance spot weld {{in real time}} is of great importance in today’s industry. Acoustic waves can solve this problem in <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> measuring certain features {{directly related to the}} weld quality – degree <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld zone, <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> beginning of melting and some others. The ultrasonic transducer incorporated into an electrode sends short acoustic pulses into the weld area and receives the signals reflected from different interfaces in heat affected zone during welding process. The specific image and signal processing algorithms applied to the received signals enable us to localize weak reflections from internal interfaces, recognize their nature and use this information to characterize the weld quality. Introduction: <b>The</b> inspection <b>of</b> resistance spot weld quality in real time is quite a challenging {{and at the same time}} promising field of NDT. It enables one to monitor <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spot weld properties right at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld manufacturing. It is extremely important on the industrial floor as it gives the operator information about <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product and thus enables him to correct the mistake before it is too late.

60|$|<b>The</b> present number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Review marks <b>the</b> close <b>of</b> a task {{which was}} confided to me {{no less than}} fifteen years ago--grande mortalis cevi spatium, a long span of one's mortal days. Fifteen years are enough to bring a man from youth to middle age, to test <b>the</b> working value <b>of</b> convictions, to measure <b>the</b> advance <b>of</b> {{principles}} and beliefs, and, alas! to cut off many early associates and to extinguish many lights. It is hardly possible that a Review should have been conducted for so considerable a time without <b>the</b> commission <b>of</b> some mistakes; articles admitted which {{might as well have}} been left out, opinions expressed which have a crudish look in <b>the</b> mellow light <b>of</b> years, phrases dropped in <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> or hurry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> which one would fain obliterate. Many a regret must rise in men's minds on any occasion that compels them to look back over a long reach <b>of</b> years. <b>The</b> disparity between aim and performance, the unfulfilled promise, the wrong turnings taken at critical points--as an accident <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hour draws us to take stock of a complete period of our lives, all these things rise up in private and internal judgment against anybody who is not either too stupid or too fatuously complacent to recognise facts when he sees them. But the mood passes. Time, happily, is merciful, and men's memories are benignly short.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the year}} {{following}} his accession to office <b>the</b> deep-seated discontent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people {{broke out in}} <b>the</b> Indian Rebellion <b>of</b> 1857. Fears were entertained, and even <b>the</b> friends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Governor-General to some extent shared them, {{that he was not}} equal to the crisis. But the fears proved groundless. He had a clear eye for <b>the</b> gravity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation, a calm judgment, and a prompt, swift hand to do what was really necessary and felt that [...] "the only way to consolidate British colonialism in India was to break up the unity shown by the Indians in the mutiny by creating internal hatred." [...] By <b>the</b> union <b>of</b> great moral qualities with high, though not the highest, intellectual faculties, he carried the Indian empire safely through <b>the</b> stress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm, and, what was perhaps a harder task still, he dealt wisely with the enormous difficulties arising at <b>the</b> close <b>of</b> such a war, established a more liberal policy and a sounder financial system, and left the people more contented than they were before. <b>The</b> name <b>of</b> Clemency Canning, which was applied to him during <b>the</b> <b>heated</b> animosities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> has since become a title of honour. He was derisively called [...] "Clemency" [...] on account of a Resolution dated 31 July 1857, which distinguished between sepoys from regiments which had mutinied and killed their officers and European civilians, and those Indian soldiers who had disbanded and dispersed to their villages, without being involved in violence. While subsequently regarded as a humane and sensible measure, the Resolution made Canning unpopular at a time when British popular opinion favored collective and indiscriminate reprisals.While rebellion was raging in Oudh he issued a proclamation declaring <b>the</b> lands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province forfeited; and this step gave rise to much angry controversy. A secret despatch, couched in arrogant and offensive terms, was addressed to the viceroy by Lord Ellenborough, then a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Derby administration, which would have justified the Governor-General in immediately resigning. But from a strong sense of duty he continued at his post; and ere long <b>the</b> general condemnation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> despatch was so strong that the writer felt it necessary to retire from office. Lord Canning replied to the despatch, calmly and in a statesman-like manner explaining and vindicating his censured policy, and in 1858 he was rewarded by being made <b>the</b> first Viceroy <b>of</b> India.|$|R

60|$|<b>The</b> details <b>of</b> {{this part}} of his speech were felt to be dull by the strangers. As long as he would abuse Mr. Gresham, men could listen with pleasure; and could keep their {{attention}} fixed while he referred to <b>the</b> general Conservatism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party which he had <b>the</b> honour <b>of</b> leading. There was a raciness in <b>the</b> promise <b>of</b> so much Church destruction from <b>the</b> chosen leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church party, which was assisted by a conviction in <b>the</b> minds <b>of</b> most men {{that it was impossible}} for unfortunate Conservatives to refuse to follow this leader, let him lead where he might. There was a gratification in feeling that the country party was bound to follow, even should he take them into <b>the</b> very bowels <b>of</b> a mountain, as the pied piper did <b>the</b> children <b>of</b> Hamelin;--and this made listening pleasant. But when Mr. Daubeny stated <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> his different clauses, explaining what was to be taken and what left,--with a fervent assurance that what was to be left would, under the altered circumstances, go much further than the whole had gone before,--then the audience became weary, and began to think that it was time that some other gentleman should be upon his legs. But at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Minister's speech there was another touch of invective which went far to redeem him. He returned to that personal question to which his adversary had undertaken to confine himself, and expressed a holy horror at the political doctrine which was implied. He, during a prolonged Parliamentary experience, had encountered much factious opposition. He would even acknowledge that he had seen it exercised on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House, though he had always striven to keep himself free from its baneful influence. But never till now had he known a statesman proclaim his intention of depending upon faction, and upon faction alone, for the result which he desired to achieve. Let the right honourable gentleman raise a contest on either the principles or <b>the</b> details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measure, and he would be quite content to abide <b>the</b> decision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House; but he should regard such a raid as that threatened against him and his friends by the right honourable gentleman as unconstitutional, revolutionary, and tyrannical. He felt sure that an opposition so based, and so maintained, even if it be enabled by <b>the</b> <b>heated</b> feelings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> to obtain an unfortunate success in the House, would not be encouraged by the sympathy and support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country at large. By these last words he was understood to signify that should he be beaten on the second reading, not in reference to <b>the</b> merits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bill, but simply on the issue as proposed by Mr. Gresham, he would again dissolve the House before he would resign. Now it was very well understood that there were Liberal members in the House who would prefer even <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> Mr. Daubeny to a speedy reappearance before their constituents.|$|R
