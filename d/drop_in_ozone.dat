It has been pointed out that other, lower-flying, airliners produce ozone during their flights in the troposphere, but vertical transit of gases between the layers is restricted. The small fleet meant overall ozone-layer degradation caused by Concorde was negligible. In 1995, David Fahey, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States, warned that a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft with exhausts similar to Concorde might produce in a 2 per cent drop in global ozone levels, much higher than previously thought. Each 1 per cent <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> is estimated to increase the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide by 2 per cent. Dr Fahey said if these particles are produced by highly oxidised sulphur in the fuel, as he believed, then removing sulphur in the fuel will reduce the ozone-destroying impact of supersonic transport.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970 Paul Crutzen {{pointed out}} that {{emissions}} of nitrous oxide (...) , a stable, long-lived gas produced by soil bacteria, from the Earth's surface could affect the amount of nitric oxide (NO) in the stratosphere. Crutzen showed that nitrous oxide lives long enough to reach the stratosphere, where it is converted into NO. Crutzen then noted that increasing use of fertilizers might have led {{to an increase in}} nitrous oxide emissions over the natural background, which would in turn result in an increase in the amount of NO in the stratosphere. Thus human activity could affect the stratospheric ozone layer. In the following year, Crutzen and (independently) Harold Johnston suggested that NO emissions from supersonic passenger aircraft, which would fly in the lower stratosphere, could also deplete the ozone layer. However, more recent analysis in 1995 by David W. Fahey, an atmospheric scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found that the <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> would be from 1–2 percent if a fleet of 500 supersonic passenger aircraft were operated.

The annual {{variation of the}} ozone partial pressure is examined and seasonal variations are explored and quantified. Direct links between the measured ozone partial pressure and common solar-wind parameters are also examined. A superposed-epoch analysis of the observations based on 191 solar proton events (SPEs) reveals a clear <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> the <b>ozone</b> partial pressure that commences following SPE-arrival at Earth. This analysis shows a reduction <b>in</b> stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>in</b> the winter/early-spring months (when the polar vortex is active over northern Finland), in contrast to summer/early-autumn months where no decrease is detected. By subtracting the natural seasonal variations <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> partial pressure the SPE-driven reduction <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> between 16 km and 24 km altitude is quantified. Analysis indicates that the ozone partial pressure during winter/early-spring is reduced, with a minimum reached ∼ 8 days following the SPE arrival. On average, the ozone partial pressure is reduced by ∼ 10 % between 16 and 24 km altitude and takes ∼ 40 days to return to its previous level. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first comprehensive statistical study, on a regional basis, that provides direct, and long-term in-situ evidence for ozone depletion by SPEs in the northern hemisphere...|$|R

Two distinct ozone layers are predicted, separated by a sharp <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> the <b>ozone</b> concentration near the mesopause. This naturally occurring mesopause ozone deep minimum is primarily produced by the rapid increase in the destruction of water vapour, and hence increase in HO x, at altitudes between 80 and 85 km, a region where water-vapour photodissociation by ultraviolet radiation of the solar Lyman-alpha line is significant, and where the supply of water vapour is maintained by methane oxidation even for very dry conditions at the tropospheric-stratospheric exchange region. The model indicates that the depth of the mesopause ozone minimum is limited by the efficiency with which inactive molecular hydrogen is produced, either by the conversion of atomic hydrogen to molecular hydrogen via one of the reaction channels of H with HO 2, or by Lyman-alpha photodissociation of water vapour via the channel that leads to the production of molecular hydrogen. The ozone concentration rapidly recovers above 85 km due to the rapid increase in O produced by the photodissociation of O 2 by absorption of ultraviolet solar radiation in the Schumann-Runge bands and continuum. Above 90 km, there is a decrease <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> due to photolysis as the production of ozone through the three-body recombination of O 2 and O becomes slower with decreasing pressure.

With concern over catalytic destruction of ozone (mid- 1970 s) {{and the development of}} the Antarctic ozone hole (mid- 1980 s), long term ozone monitoring has become the primary focus of NASA's series of ozone measuring instruments. A series of TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) and SBUV (Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet) instruments has produced a nearly continuous record of global ozone from 1979 to the present. These instruments infer ozone by measuring sunlight backscattered from the atmosphere in the ultraviolet through differential absorption. These measurements have documented a 15 Dobson Unit <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> global average <b>ozone</b> since 1980, and the declines <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>in</b> the antarctic each October have been far more dramatic.

40|$|The {{impact of}} odd {{chlorine}} (Cly) and odd nitrogen (NOy) perturbations (resulting from human activities) and of enhanced H 2 O-H 2 SO 4 aerosol load (associated with volcanic activity) on stratospheric ozone (25 km altitude, midlatitudes) is assessed {{by using a}} chemical box model in which key heterogeneous reactions {{on the surface of}} sulfate aerosol particles are taken into account. The model shows that if transport is ignored, the response of the photochemical system to increased abundances of odd chlorine and odd nitrogen and to enhanced aerosol surface area density is characterized by a multiequilibrium regime. Catastrophic transitions may occur and may produce dramatic reductions in the stratospheric ozone concentration. When the dissipative effects associated with transport are taken into account, the system still exhibits a nonlinear response to external nitrogen and chlorine sources but without multiequilibrium solutions or catastrophic transitions. Over a sensitive interval, small external disturbances applied to model parameters can lead to large changes {{in the state of the}} system.

Source-receptor analysis is used to quantify the contributions of background ozone and Chinese anthropogenic emissions on this variability. Annual mean background ozone over China shows a spatial gradient from 55 ppbv in the northwest to 20 ppbv in the southeast, corresponding with changes in topography and ozone lifetime. Anthropogenic background (annual mean of 12. 6 ppbv) shows distinct troughs {{in the summer and}} peaks in the spring.

The mid-summer <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> over eastern China is driven by the decrease of background ozone (− 15 ppbv). Tagged simulations suggest that this decrease is driven by reduced transport from Europe and North America, whereas ozone from Southeast Asia and Pacific Ocean exhibits a maximum in the summer over eastern China.
