40|$|Background: Treatment of elbow {{dislocation}} with irreparable radial head fracture needs {{replacement of}} radial head to achieve stability of elbow. An alternate method {{in cases of}} elbow dislocation with radial head fracture can be resection of radial head with repair of medial collateral ligament. We report a retrospective analysis of cases of elbow dislocation with irreparable radial head treated by excision <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> and repair of MCL. Materials and Methods: Nine patients of elbow dislocation with associated irreparable fractures {{of the head of}} the radius were included in this analysis (6 F: 3 M, Age: 35 - 47 years). Radial head excision was done through the lateral approach and MCL was sutured using no 3 Ethibond using medial approach. Above elbow plaster was given for 6 weeks and gradual mobilization was done thereafter. All patients were assessed at final followup using Mayo elbow performance score (MEPS). Results: Mean followup was 19. 55 ± 7. 12 months (range 14 - 36 months). There was no extension deficit when compared to opposite side with mean range of flexion of 138. 8 ° ± 6. 97 ° (range 130 - 145 °). Mean pronation was 87. 7 ° ± 4. 4 ° (range 80 - 90 °) and mean supination was 87. 7 ± 4. 62 ° (range 80 - 90 °). The mean MEPS was 98. 8 ± 3. 33 (range 90 - 100). No patient had pain, sensory complaints, subluxation or redislocation. All were able to carry out their daily activities without disability. Conclusion: Radial head excision with MCL repair is an acceptable option for treatment of patients with elbow dislocation and irreparable radial head fracture...|$|E

The injuries included fracture humerus associated with radial nerve injury, fracture of both forearm bones, fracture olecranon along with dislocation of the elbow and fracture of the first metacarpal bone. The classification and the plan of management of sideswipe injury are reviewed. To {{the best of our}} knowledge this combined multiple injuries have not reported. Bahrain Med Bull 1995; 17 : Multiple fractures around the elbow are common in sideswipe injuries 1. The outcome of these injuries is variable. It can include amputation, elbow arthrodesis, permanent stiffness, and non union 2. Campbel classified sideswipe injuries according to the combination of fracture of shafts of ulna and radius, comminuted fracture of <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> and distal humeral condyles 3. Shorbe in 1941 classified it into five groups according to the severity of the condition. Group 1 include only soft tissue involvement, group 2 is the commonest and includes fracture of olecranon process, group 3 is associated with fracture of both radius and ulna, group 4 includes any humeral fracture, and in the severest group 5, there are fracture of all bones around the elbow along with severe soft tissue and neurovascular injuries 4.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{described in}} this paper was suggested by the recent case of a twenty-five-year-old woman who developed temporary paralysis of the right posterior interosseous nerve after excision of a fractured <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>radius.</b> Although it is widely accepted that the posterior interosseous nerve is at risk during resection of the radial head, {{a search of the}} literature failed to reveal any described method of safeguarding the nerve. The present investigation concerns the relationship of the posterior interosseous nerve to the radius in different positions of the elbow. It was postulated that the canal in the supinator muscle through which the posterior interosseous nerve runs has a fixed relationship to the radial neck. A particular object {{of the study was to}} test the assumption that pronation of the forearm would pull the nerve medially, away from the operation site. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten elbow-joint preparations from five cadavers were used. As it was not possible to demonstrate the course ofthe posterior interosseous nerve by simple dissection ofa preparation without disturbing the normal anatomical relationships, a radiographic technique was devised requiring direct injection of a contrast medium into the nerve. In each specimen, the radial nerve was first exposed anteriorly by developing the plane of cleavage between the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles by blunt dissection. The radial nerve was followed as far as the VULNERABILITY OF THE POSTERIOR INTEROSSEOUS NERVE DURING RADIAL HEAD RESECTION 321 cubital fossa where it divides into the superficial radial nerve and the posterior interosseous nerve, which immediately enters the supinator muscle. By splitting the extensor muscle mass on the extensor aspect of the forearm, the posterior interosseous nerve was exposed from below as it emerged from the supinator muscle. It must be noted that: 1) the supinator canal was left intact; 2) at no time was the posterior interosseous nerve itself mobilised; and 3) the muscle masses were not cut transversely, so tha...|$|E
40|$|This note {{seeks to}} {{evaluate}} the self-propulsion of a micro-organism, in a viscous fluid, by sending a helical wave down its flagellated tail. An explanation is provided to resolve the paradoxical phenomenon that a micro-organism can roll about its longitudinal axis without passing bending waves along its tail (Rothschild 1961, 1962; Bishop 1958; Gray 1962). The effort made by tho organism in so doing is not torsion, but bending simultaneously in two mutually perpendicular planes. The mechanical model of the micro-organism adopted {{for the present study}} consists of a spherical <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> ɑ and a long cylindrical tail of cross-sectional radius b, along which a helical wave progresses distally. Under the equilibrium condition at a constant forward speed, both the net force and net torque acting on the organism are required to vanish, yielding two equations for the velocity of propulsion, U, and the induced angular velocity, Ω, of the organism. In order that this type of motion can be realized, it is necessary for the head of the organism to exceed a certain critical size, and some amount of body rotation is inevitable. In fact, there exists 1 m optimum head-tail ratio ɑ/bat which the propulsion velocity U reaches a maximum, holding the other physical parameters fixed. The power required for propulsion by means of helical waves is determined, based on which a hydromechanical efficiency η is defined. When the head-tail ratio ɑ/b assumes its optimum value and when b is very small compared with the wavelength λ, η ≃ Ω/ω approximately (Ω being the induced angular velocity of the head, ω the circular frequency of the helical wave). This η reaches a maximum at kh ≃ 0. 9 (k being the wavenumber 2 π/λ, and h the amplitude of the helical wave). In the neighbourhood of kh = 0. 9, the optimum head-tail ratio varies in the range 15 < a/b < 40, the propulsion velocity in 0. 08 < U/c < 0. 2 (c = ω/k being the wave phase velocity), and the efficiency in 0. 14 < η < 0. 24, as kb varies over 0. 03 < kb < 0. 2, a range of practical interest. Furthermore, a comparison between the advantageous features of planar and helical waves, relative to each other, is made in terms of their propulsive velocities and power consumptions...|$|E

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The helical motion of an infinitely long flagellum with a cross-sectional radius b, along which a helical wave of amplitude h, wave-length [lambda] and phase velocity c is propagated, has been analyzed by using Stokes' equations in a helical coordinate system (r,[xi],x). In order to satisfy all the boundary conditions, namely the no-slip condition on the flagellum surface and zero perturbation velocity at infinity, the flagellum must propel {{itself with a}} propulsion velocity U {{in the opposite direction}} to the phase velocity c. For small values of kb (where k = 2 [pi]/[lambda] is the wave number), by a single-harmonic approximation for the outer region (r > h), the ratio of the propulsion velocity U to the phase velocity c is found to be[ [...] . ], where K[n](kh) is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. A modified and improved version of the Gray and Hancock method has been developed and applied to evaluate helical movements of a freely swimming microorganism with a spherical <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> a and a tail of finite length and cross-sectional radius b. The propulsion velocity U and the induced angular velocity [omega] of the organism are derived. In order that this type of motion can be realized, it is necessary for the head of the organism to exceed a certain critical size, and some amount of body rotation is inevitable. For fixed kb and kh, an optimum head-tail ratio a/b, at which the propulsion velocity U reaches a maximum, has been discovered. The power required for propulsion by means of helical waves is determined, based on which a hydromechanical efficiency [eta] is defined. This [eta] reaches a maximum at kh [ [...] . ] 0. 9 for microorganisms with optimum head-tail ratios. In the neighborhood of kh = 0. 9, the optimum head-tail ratio varies in the range 15 < a/b < 40, the propulsion velocity in 0. 08 < U/c < 0. 2, and the efficiency in 0. 14 < [eta] < 0. 24, as kb varies over 0. 03 < kb < 0. 2. The modified version of the Gray and Hancock method has also been utilized to describe the locomotion of spirochetes. It is found that although a spirochete has no head to resist the induced viscous torque, it can still propel by means of helical waves provided that the spirochete spins with an induced angular velocity [omega]. Thus the 'Spirochete paradox' is resolved. In order to achieve a maximum propulsion velocity, it is discovered that a spirochete should keep its amplitude-wavelength ratio h/[lambda] around 1 : 6 (or kh [ [...] . ] 1). At kh = 1, the propulsion velocity varies in the range 0 < U/c < 0. 2, and the induced angular velocity in 0. 4 < [omega]/[low-case omega] < 1 (where [low-case omega] = kc is the circular frequency of the helical wave), as the radius-amplitude ratio varies over 0 < b/h < 1. A series of experiments have been carried out to determine by simulation the relative importance of the so-called 'neighboring' effect and 'end' effect, and results for the case of uniform helical waves are presente...|$|E
