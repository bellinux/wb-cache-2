5|$|The {{recommended}} {{treatment of}} new-onset pulmonary tuberculosis, as of 2010, is {{six months of}} a combination of antibiotics containing rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and <b>ethambutol</b> for the first two months, and only rifampicin and isoniazid for the last four months. Where resistance to isoniazid is high, <b>ethambutol</b> may be added for the last four months as an alternative.|$|E
25|$|If the {{organism}} {{is known to}} be fully sensitive, then treatment is with isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide for two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for four months. <b>Ethambutol</b> need not be used.|$|E
25|$|Pyrazinamide is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} tuberculosis. For active tuberculosis it is often used together with rifampin, isoniazid, and either streptomycin or <b>ethambutol.</b> It is not generally recommended {{for the treatment of}} latent tuberculosis. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} regimen is 2HRE/7HR, {{for which}} there is excellent clinical trial evidence. The 1994 US CDC guidelines for tuberculosis erroneously cite Slutkin as evidence that a nine-month regimen using only isoniazid and rifampicin is acceptable, but almost all of the patients in that study received <b>ethambutol</b> for the first two to three months (although this is not obvious from the abstract of that article). This mistake was rectified in the 2003 guidelines.|$|E
25|$|Many {{inhibitor}}s of glycosyltransferases are known. Some {{of these}} are natural products, such as moenomycin, an inhibitor of peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases, the nikkomycins, inhibitors of chitin synthase, and the echinocandins, inhibitors of fungal b-1,3-glucan synthases. Some glycosyltransferase inhibitors are of use as drugs or antibiotics. Moenomycin is used in animal feed as a growth promoter. Caspofungin has been developed from the echinocandins and is in use as an antifungal agent. <b>Ethambutol</b> is an inhibitor of mycobacterial arabinotransferases and {{is used for the}} treatment of tuberculosis. Lufenuron is an inhibitor of insect chitin synthases and is used to control fleas in animals.|$|E

2500|$|First-line anti-tuberculous drug {{names are}} often remembered with the {{mnemonic}} [...] "RIPE," [...] {{referring to the}} use of a rifamycin (like rifampin), isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and <b>ethambutol.</b> The US uses abbreviations and names that are not internationally recognised: rifampicin is called rifampin and abbreviated RIF; streptomycin is abbreviated STM. In the US only, streptomycin is no longer considered a first line drug by ATS/IDSA/CDC because of high rates of resistance. The WHO have made no such recommendation.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{side effect of}} pyrazinamide is hepatotoxicity, which is dose related. [...] The old dose for pyrazinamide was 40–70mg/kg daily and the incidence of drug-induced hepatitis has fallen significantly since the recommended dose has been reduced. [...] In the standard four-drug regimen (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, <b>ethambutol),</b> pyrazinamide {{is the most common}} cause of drug-induced hepatitis. It is not possible to clinically distinguish pyrazinamide-induced hepatitis from hepatitis caused by isoniazid or rifampicin; test dosing is required (this is discussed in detail in tuberculosis treatment) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} [...] "short" [...] course {{treatment for}} TB is isoniazid (along with pyridoxal phosphate to obviate peripheral neuropathy caused by isoniazid), rifampicin (also known as rifampin in the United States), pyrazinamide, and <b>ethambutol</b> for two months, then isoniazid and rifampicin {{alone for a}} further four months. The patient {{is considered to be}} free of living bacteria after six months. For latent tuberculosis, the standard treatment is six to nine months of daily isoniazid alone or three months of weekly (12 doses total) of isoniazid/rifapentine combination.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethambutol,</b> a drug {{commonly}} used to treat tuberculosis, is notorious for causing toxic optic neuropathy. Patients with vision loss from <b>ethambutol</b> toxicity lose vision in both eyes equally. This initially presents with problems with colors (dyschromatopsia) and can leave central visual deficits. If vision loss occurs while using <b>ethambutol,</b> {{it would be best}} to discontinue this medication under a doctor’s supervision. Vision can improve slowly after discontinuing <b>ethambutol</b> but rarely returns to baseline.|$|E
