The solution for the Skewb Diamond {{can be used to}} solve this puzzle, by identifying the Diamond's <b>face</b> <b>pieces</b> with the Ultimate's corner pieces, and the Diamond's corner pieces with the Ultimate's edge pieces. The only additional trick here is that the Ultimate's corner pieces (equivalent to the Diamond's <b>face</b> <b>pieces)</b> are sensitive to orientation, and so may require an additional algorithm for orienting them after being correctly placed.|$|R
5000|$|The puzzle {{consists}} of 4 corner <b>pieces,</b> 4 <b>face</b> centers, 6 edge pieces, and 12 non-center <b>face</b> <b>pieces.</b> Being an edge-turning puzzle, the edge pieces only rotate in place, {{while the rest}} of the pieces can be permuted. The face centers and corner pieces are interchangeable because they are both corners although they are shaped differently, and the non-center <b>face</b> <b>pieces</b> may be flipped, leading to a wide variety of exotic shapes as the puzzle is twisted. If only 180° turns are made, it is possible to scramble only the colors while retaining the puzzle's tetrahedral shape. When 90° and 180° turns are made this puzzle can [...] "shape shift″.|$|R

5000|$|A {{respirator}} {{is designed}} to protect the wearer from inhaling harmful dusts, fumes, vapors, and/or gases. Respirators come {{in a wide range of}} types and sizes used by the military, private industry, and the public. Respirators range from cheaper, single-use, disposable masks to reusable models with replaceable cartridges. There are two main categories: the air-purifying respirator, which forces contaminated air through a filtering element, and the air-supplied respirator, in which an alternate supply of fresh air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contents.The term respirator in the hospital setting refers to the N95 filtering <b>face</b> <b>piece</b> masks that are commonly used to care for patients with Tuberculosis. There was much controversy over the use of these masks during the H1N1 outbreak of 2009.|$|E
50|$|The S6 {{respirator}} provided {{protection to}} the face, eyes, lung and throat of the wearer against all known chemical agents of that time. The filter of the respirator did not filter out carbon dioxide. The S6 features an innovative air seal around {{the inside of}} the <b>face</b> <b>piece</b> to improve the fit and comfort of the mask; a tap inside the nose cup was to allow the equalisation of pressure inside the air seal, in different climatic conditions. The wearers natural body heat would then warm the trapped air to inflate the air seal, thus getting a better seal around the face. The mask could also be made to benefit left-handed people, where the filter canister is positioned on the right of the face mask instead of the left. The location of the filter on the left or right side of the mask was to allow the rifle to be shouldered, aimed and fired correctly.|$|E

50|$|The M17 Protective Mask is {{a series}} of gas masks that were {{designed}} and produced in 1959 (as a replacement of the M-9 gas mask) to provide protection from all types of known chemical and biological agents present. The M-17 was issued to troops in the Vietnam war, and was standard issue for the U.S. Military until it was replaced by the M40 Field Protective Mask for the U.S. Army and USMC in the mid 1990s while the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force replaced it for the MCU-2/P Gas Mask. The mask has different components including a filter, a <b>face</b> <b>piece</b> and outserts. Filter elements in the <b>face</b> <b>piece</b> prevent harmful agents from entering the mask. The M17 series includes three types of masks, the M17, M17A1 and M17A2. An experimental transparent-silicone model called the XM27 was designed in late 1966, but was turned down in favor of the XM28E4. Many countries have copied the M17 design. Notable copies include the Bulgarian PDE-1, Japanese Type-3, the Polish Mp-4 and the Czech OM10 or M10M.These protective masks have inbuilt voice emitter systems that facilitate communication, a tube for drinking water from the M1 canteen cap (A1 & A2), and a pair of outserts to protect eye lenses and an air pathway that reduced fogging. The mask is packed in a carrier that also contains other items like a nerve agent antidote kit (NAAK), a convulsive antidote for nerve agents (CANA) and an M-258A1 decontamination kit. It also contains a M1 waterproof bag to protect filter elements from water damage. Other components attached are mask hoods to protect the head and neck area, a winterization kit to prevent frost accumulation during cold weather conditions and optical inserts for soldiers with vision defects.The M17A1 was designed with intent to allow a masked soldier to provide artificial respiration to an unmasked casualty, the resuscitation tube was a noble idea gone wrong. The problem with it being the exposure of both soldiers to contamination, the soldier giving aid ran the risk of encountering resistance from the airway of the casualty, pushing air back into his mask and breaking the seal on it. The casualty would remain unmasked, and would continue absorbing the contaminated environment. It was for this reason that the resuscitation tube system was no longer issued for the A1 and was dropped on the M17A2.|$|E
5000|$|From {{north to}} south, the units mainly {{affected}} the 3rd Division in the 76th Brigade were the 10th Royal Welch Fusiliers (10th RWF) {{and in the}} 72nd Brigade, 24th Division, the 1st North Staffs, 8th Queen's and the 2nd Leinsters and the 13th Middlesex of the 73rd Brigade. The gas release began at 12:35 a.m. on a front of 3500 yd, from Spanbroekmolen to La Petite Douvre Farm, except for two small sectors. In the north the flow of gas was continuous for about ten minutes and farther south the gas came in two waves, over 30-40 minutes. As soon as the gas cloud drifted German attacks began, mainly at points where no gas had been released. Shell or trench mortar bombs with chloromethyl chloroformate were used against the front line and some lacrymatory [...] "T" [...] shells were fired on the British support lines, with no effect. The gas moved east-north-east at 9 - 12 mph over Wulverghem, Neuve Eglise and Bailleul. Gas concentration on the flanks of the cloud declined rapidly but at Bailleul, 11000 yd back from the front line, coughing and vomiting occurred in some cases of people caught the open. Closing windows and doors kept most of the gas out of buildings. On high ground near Neuve Eglise, the concentration was low but was high on Ravelsberg Ridge to the west. Vegetation was turned yellow {{as far back as}} 1200 from the front line. Many rats in the trenches were killed and eleven cows, 23 calves, a horse, one pig and 15 hens were killed in fields; other cattle and pigs showed signs of gas poisoning. A potentially lethal concentration for an unmasked person extended for 9000 - 10000 yd from the discharge point and about 14,000 troops donned gas helmets during the attack, including many {{on the outskirts of the}} cloud, who wore helmets as a precaution. Troops in the front line received little warning before the gas arrived. In places the cloud was seen to rise from the German trenches as a white mist and hissing was audible at some points but was drowned by rifle and machine-gun fire elsewhere.

50|$|If {{the puzzle}} is only {{scrambled}} using 180° twists, {{then it is}} obviously solvable using only 180° twists.

30|$|The sensor has two imaging probes for {{receiving}} signals. It is fixed with a triangular support and can adjust the angle {{to adapt to}} the received signal. There are two laser emission points on the probe. The offset to the object is received or reflected by other silver-white reflective points on the probe. After receiving, the laser-emitting point is symmetric to form a cross-laser range. The laser cross-sectional area based on the detection angle and the measurement distance is generally 70  mm[*]×[*] 70  mm. The camera sensor transmits the received signal to the host. The host uses the principle of triangulation based on the image distance, image point, depth distance, and so forth. The first point in this principle is that the emitted light beam is projected on the object. The two points are the reflection points. The third point is the accepted camera probe. When it receives the signal of the reflection point, it has two corners of the triangle and the distance {{from the surface of the}} triangle to the surface of the object when it is launched. One of the three coordinates of the target can be obtained, one of which is specific and is related to the launch angle and the coordinate direction setting. In the laser reflection movement process, there will be a difference in the angle formed by the movement, from which the other two are calculated. The coordinate point of the direction determines the three-dimensional coordinates of the measured object and feeds it back to the corresponding working machine, presenting a figure composed of a point cloud or a triangular <b>face</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|E

In particular, it is critical point to keep the product quality matching product criteria for the safe and health industry. In Korean market, there are several respirators for industrial purpose. Some of them are imported from the global manufacturers such as 3 M, and the rests are developed in domestic companies. However, {{most of them have}} the face seal leakage problem, because they were not designed by the watertight research for Korean facial characteristics. The focus of the study is to establish a design process to match a <b>face</b> <b>piece</b> of industrial respirator for Korean facial characteristics. To accomplish the study aims, the following procedure was implemented. (1) For a test panel, 60 Korean were selected by research parameters. (2) shape of faces from the test panel was scanned by 3 d digitizer. (3) the parameter scales for 3 standard faces(L,M,S) were established from statistical analysis. (4) To make a whole shape of faces fit the scales, the similar shape sample faces was selected from the test panel. (5) the physical model faces are made by RP. (6) the sample faces are reshaped to fit the scales by a clay modeling method. (7) digitizing the model faces to recheck for fitting to the parameter scales. (8) 3 types of masks are completed by digital modeling and tangible models are prototyped by RP. (9) the silicon models are made and examined by simple naked eye test.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{investigate}} {{the presence of}} pathogenic microbes on chiropractic treatment tables in one outpatient teaching clinic. Additional aims were to test inexpensive disinfectants on tables that may kill microbes and suggest infection control measures for chiropractic offices, clinics and classrooms. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the presence of pathogenic microbes on treatment tables in one outpatient teaching clinic and determine a simple behavioral model for infection control including table disinfection and accepted hand washing and sanitizing protocols. Methods 10 treatment tables were selected and sampled for possible microbial flora on face and hand pieces. Samples were cultured on MacConky's agar and mannitol salt agar, labeled and incubated for up to 48 hours. Confirmatory testing of microbes to determine if drug resistant flora were present was performed. Among tables tested, 5 were selected to test disinfectants. One-half of the <b>face</b> <b>piece</b> and 1 hand piece were treated with two different wipes and then post-tested for microbes. Results Pathogenic microbes were present on chiropractic treatment tables including methicillin-resistant Staph aureus. Simple disinfectants neutralized the pathogens. A rudimentary disinfection procedure and infection control measures are suggested based on the findings. Conclusion Pathogenic microbes may be present on chiropractic treatment tables and can be effectively killed with proper disinfecting. Hand washing/sanitizing is an important measure in infection control as is table disinfecting. Rudimentary behavioral changes to improve chiropractic clinic infection control are needed. More comprehensive behavioral models are needed. All teaching clinics and private chiropractic offices should adopt infection control practices including routine table disinfecting and hand sanitizing. Effective measures can be put in place at minimal costs. Accrediting bodies of chiropractic institutions should mandate an infection control plan for member institutions immediately. </p...|$|E
