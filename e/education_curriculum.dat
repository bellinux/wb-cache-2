A literature review was completed, in order to examine and compare the craft and technology <b>education</b> <b>curriculums</b> in Finland and Slovenia. In addition, a quantitative survey was subsequently distributed to 505 school students in Finland and Slovenia. The questionnaire consisted of 14 questions, which aimed to ascertain students’ attitudes towards craft and technology. The survey showed substantial differences in students’ attitudes towards craft and technology education in the two countries: these differences may be explained by differences in the national curriculums, the different pedagogical traditions and cultural differences in the field of technology. However, for deeper understanding, the quantitative findings need to be examined further with different research methods...|$|R
