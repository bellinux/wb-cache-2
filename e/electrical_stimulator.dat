40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of tissues is an increasingly valuable tool for treating {{a variety of}} disorders, with applications including cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants, visual prostheses, deep brain stimulators, spinal cord stimulators, and muscle stimulators.

40|$|Three {{types of}} muscle model are {{discussed}} in this paper. Because they are time-dependent and highly nonlinear, its performance with the functional <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulator</b> (FES) must be studied so as to ensure the robustness to changes in system gain, since the gain can vary substantially and abruptly with changes in operating point. The paper is to study the use of neural network adaptive control to regulate the FES output {{in order to achieve}} functional restoration and activities. A multiple level neural network with recurrent neural networks as system inversive identification is examined. Simulation experiment shows that it has stability, self-tuning, robust and adaptive. The network is then applied to an extended period quasi-resonant converter for the application as an FES. The circuit was originally used as a power converter, but is now used in this application as an <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulator</b> because it has three degrees of freedom.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the effects of {{selected}} frequencies from two different pulsed <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulators</b> on blood flow, blood pressure, and heart rate. Each of 30 healthy subjects attended 10 study sessions: 1 torque-testing session, 1 control session consisting of no electrical stimulation (ES), and 8 sessions of ES. All subjects received ES at an intensity sufficient to produce torque equal to 15 % of the predetermined maximal voluntary contraction of their right quadriceps femoris muscle. The results of a multivariate analysis of variance showed that changes in blood flow during and after ES were dependent on pulse frequency but independent of stimulator type. Further analysis showed significant increases in blood flow with ES using 10, 20, and 50 pulses per second compared with 1 pulse per second. Inconsistent changes in blood pressure and heart rate were produced by ES. Based on the results of this study, effective clinical use of ES for promoting arterial blood flow to muscle would involve pulsed frequencies of 10 to 50 pulses per second.

Methods and Procedures; The literature is reviewed over the last 25 years examining the normal recruitment order of motor units, the impact of recruitment order, stimulation frequency and asynchronous recruitment on muscle strength and endurance. Results; Recruitment order has little impact on muscle endurance. However, synchronous stimulation (where all units are stimulated together, drastically reduces muscle endurance. Stimulation frequency above 20 Hertz also reduces endurance.
