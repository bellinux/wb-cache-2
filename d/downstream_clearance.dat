50|$|The CPDLC {{application}} provides air-ground {{data communication}} for the ATC service. This includes {{a set of}} clearance/information/request message elements which correspond to voice phraseology employed by air traffic control procedures. The controller is provided with the capability to issue level assignments, crossing constraints, lateral deviations, route changes and clearances, speed assignments, radio frequency assignments, and various requests for information. The pilot is provided with the capability to respond to messages, to request clearances and information, to report information, and to declare/rescind an emergency. The pilot is, in addition, provided with the capability to request conditional <b>clearances</b> (<b>downstream)</b> and information from a downstream air traffic service unit (ATSU). A “free text” capability is also provided to exchange information not conforming to defined formats. An auxiliary capability is provided to allow a ground system to use data link to forward a CPDLC message to another ground system.|$|R
40|$|The mean {{velocity}} and Reynolds stress tensor throughout a whirling annular seal are presented. The {{data was collected}} with a three dimensional laser Doppler velocimeter using phase averaging. Two axial flow conditions (Re = 12, 000 and 24, 000) were studied at one shaft speed (Ta = 6, 600). The eccentricity and whirl ratios were 50 and 100 percent, respectively. There is a region of high axial momentum in this region is higher in the low Reynolds number case due to an axial recirculation zone that occurs on the suction side of the rotor at the inlet. The recirculation zone does not occur in the high Reynolds number case. At both Reynolds numbers, there is a recirculation zone on the rotor surface in the pressure side of the inlet. This recirculation zone extends from 20 to 200 degrees rotor zenith in the tangential direction, and is one third of a clearance wide radially. The high Reynolds number recirculation zone is 1. 5 mean clearances long, while the low Reynolds number zone extends 2 mean <b>clearances</b> <b>downstream.</b> When compared to previous studies, {{it is apparent that}} the tangential momentum is no greater for a seal with whirl than for one without if other parameters are constant. Areas of high tangential momentum occur in the clearance where the axial momentum is low. Average exit plane tangential velocities in the high Reynolds number case are 1. 5 times greater than those in the other flow case. These results are in general agreement with predictions made by other investigators...|$|R
40|$|This study {{treats the}} {{calculation}} of longitudinal forces on a ship in a lock chamber due to the levelling procedure. The {{focus will be on}} the force resulting from the filling jet through the levelling door in the lock, with the main point of interest being the interaction between the ship and the flow resulting from the jet. To understand more about this interaction the following methods are used: the one-dimensional software model Lockfill, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and scale model tests. The study was initiated in the context of improving the accuracy and applicability of the software Lockfill. Lockfill is based on the conservation laws of mass and momentum, while schematising the flow using a two-dimensional parameterization of the filling jet. A two dimensional situation was created for the scale model, neglecting variations over the width. The scaled situation was tested using a CFD model to prepare for the scale model measurements. This preparation revealed that the jet attaches to the bottom for the chosen geometry. The flow measurements consist of multiple point measurements and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements just downstream of the gate. The longitudinal forces on the ship were measured for variations in: keel <b>clearance,</b> <b>downstream</b> position of the ship with respect to the gate and water level difference over the gate. The presence of the ship reduces the deflection of the jet towards the bottom. The reason for the reduced deflection is the interference of the ship’s bow with the upper eddy limiting the fluid motion, resulting in a reduction of pressure and therefore a deflection of the jet in the upward direction. This means that the momentum flux in the jet for the situation without ship decreases faster because it attaches to the bottom closer to the gate. The measured forces were compared to the forces Lockfill would predict for the same situation. Both CFD and PIV predict the forces with a small relative error. Lockfill determines the force on the ship accurately as long as the momentum flux can be determined successfully. Determining the momentum flux comes down to a correct schematisation of the filling jet. Variations in keel clearance and discharge are covered quite well by Lockfill. However an increase in distance from the gate reveals big differences compared to the measurements. This is caused by an overestimation of momentum flux dissipation in the Lockfill jet schematisation. The {{reason for this is that}} in reality the jet stays more attached to the bottom, therefore maintaining a higher momentum flux. Taking into account the results from this study, the improvement of Lockfill should start with the schematisation of the filling jet. A start can be made by implementing the tendency of the jet to attach to a boundary. Natte kunstwerken van de toekoms...|$|R
