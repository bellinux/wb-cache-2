50|$|Although some bullet casting {{procedures}} can {{be accomplished}} with heating elements used for cooking; {{care must be taken}} to avoid contaminating food preparation areas and/or utensils with lead alloys. Most bullet casters prefer to use portable <b>electric</b> <b>melting</b> pots in areas with good ventilation. Molten metal can cause serious burns; and molten metal can be sprayed around the working area by violently expanding steam if it comes in contact with water from spilled drinks or other sources. Bullet casters should wear protective clothing including eye protection, and should carefully wash hands prior to eating, drinking, or smoking. Young children are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning and are unlikely to appreciate the danger of shiny molten metal and newly cast bullets. Bullet casting must be limited to times and locations when children are absent.Particular risk comes from the oxides of lead and other metals present in lead alloys, as oxides are often more easily absorbed than the metallic forms. This means that the dross that is skimmed from the lead pot may pose a larger hazard than the metallic alloys.|$|E

40|$|The paper reviews {{original}} {{data obtained by}} the present authors, revealed in recent separate publications, describing specific procedures for high quality grey irons, and reflecting the forecast needs of the worldwide iron foundry industry. High power, medium frequency coreless induction furnaces are commonly used in <b>electric</b> <b>melting</b> grey iron foundries. This has resulted in low sulphur (1, 500 °C), contributing to unfavourable conditions for graphite nucleation. Thin wall castings are increasingly produced by these electric melt shops with a risk of greater eutectic undercooling during solidification. The paper focused on two groups of grey cast irons and their specific problems: carbides and graphite morphology control in lower carbon equivalent high strength irons (CE= 3. 4 %- 3. 8 %), and austenite dendrite promotion in eutectic and slightly hypereutectic irons (CE= 4. 1 %- 4. 5 %), {{in order to increase}} their strength characteristics. There are 3 stages and 3 steps involving graphite formation, iron chemistry and iron processing that appear to be important. The concept in the present paper sustains a threestage model for nucleating flake graphite [(Mn,X) S type nuclei]. There are three important groups of elements (deoxidizer, Mn/S, and inoculant) and three technological stages in <b>electric</b> <b>melting</b> of iron (superheat, pre-conditioning of base iron, final inoculation). Attention is drawn to a control factor (%Mn) x (%S) ensuring it equals to 0. 03 – 0. 06, accompanied by 0. 005 wt. %– 0. 010 wt. % Al and/or Zr content in inoculated irons. It was found that iron powder addition promotes austenite dendrite formation in eutectic and slightly eutectic, acting as reinforcement for the eutectic cells. But, there is an accompanying possible negative influence on the characteristics of the (Mn,X) S type graphite nuclei (change the morphology of nuclei from polygonal compact to irregular polygonal, and therefore promote chill tendency in treated irons). A double addition (iron powder + inoculant) appears to be an effective treatment to benefit both austenite and graphite nucleation, with positive effects on the final structure and chill tendency...|$|E

Aluminium metal matrix composites reinforced with SiC particles are prepared by liquid metallurgy route using LM 6 aluminium alloy and silicon carbide particles (size ~ 37 µm) by varying the weight fraction of SiC in the range of 5 %- 10 %.
