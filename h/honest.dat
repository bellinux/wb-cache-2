5|$|As {{an interim}} measure, the US offered the <b>Honest</b> John missile. The offer was accepted, and 120 <b>Honest</b> John {{missiles}} with W31 warheads were supplied in 1960, enough to equip three artillery regiments, the 24th at Nienburg (and later Paderborn), the 39th at Sennelager, and the 50th at Menden, with two batteries each. In addition, each regiment had two batteries of eight-inch M115 howitzers (later replaced by M110 howitzers) with W33 nuclear warheads. A British nuclear artillery round project was cancelled in 1958, and Blue Water met {{the same fate}} on 10 August 1962. The <b>Honest</b> Johns therefore remained in service until 1977. One of the <b>Honest</b> John regiments, the 50th Missile Regiment, Royal Artillery, was then re-equipped with the Lance missile, with its W70 nuclear warhead. The W48 was acquired for the 155mm M109 howitzers. Both it and the W33 would remain in service until 1992. The British Army also considered acquiring the Davy Crockett, but had decided against it by February 1962.|$|E

5|$|Before 1920 if {{one player}} {{approached}} another player {{to throw a}} contest, {{there was a very}} good chance he would not be informed upon. Now, there was an excellent chance he would be turned in. No <b>honest</b> player wanted to meet the same fate as Buck Weaver... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically <b>honest</b> Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that <b>honest</b> players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E

5|$|One {{class of}} <b>honest</b> signal is the aposematic warning signal, {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning signals are <b>honest</b> indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.|$|E

5|$|Post-Skilling, some {{courts have}} held that gratuities may be reached as kickbacks, while others {{have held that}} they may not. Prof. Coffee has argued that <b>honest</b> {{services}} fraud doctrine should explicitly distinguish {{between public and private}} corruption.|$|E

5|$|After the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, John Herdman {{was hired}} as {{head coach of the}} Canadian {{national}} team. He rebuilt the team and used inclusive language to help create an environment that allowed players to be <b>honest</b> with each other and grow. McLeod was able to address issues that she had with herself and others, which she attributed to helping re-build her confidence.|$|E
5|$|Aposematic animals {{often have}} (<b>honest)</b> threat displays; edible prey {{sometimes}} have (bluffing) startle displays. For example the frilled lizard, Chlamydosaurus kingii, {{is illustrated in}} a drawing by Cott, with its tail raised over the body, stretched up on all four legs, mouth wide open, and frills out {{both sides of the}} head, making it a startling sight.|$|E
5|$|Ayer, who {{had written}} several police {{procedural}} films previously, wanted the film {{to focus more on}} the friendship between partners and <b>honest</b> police work rather than corruption. Gyllenhaal, Peña, and other cast members underwent an intensive training program to prepare for their roles as police officers. Filming took place in Los Angeles in August 2011 with a budget of $7 million.|$|E
5|$|Baxter had {{now been}} {{governor}} {{for a year}} and was following an independent course. He began dismantling the systems put in place by the Minstrels. He appointed <b>honest</b> Democrats and Republicans to the Election Commission, reorganized the militia by placing it {{under the control of the}} State, rather than the governor, and pushed for an amendment to the state constitution to re-enfranchise ex-Confederates.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, the I Ching {{was being}} {{read as a}} work of {{intricate}} philosophy, as a jumping-off point for examining great metaphysical questions and ethical issues. Cheng Yi, patriarch of the Neo-Confucian Cheng–Zhu school, read the I Ching as a guide to moral perfection. He described the text as a way to for ministers to form <b>honest</b> political factions, root out corruption, and solve problems in government.|$|E
5|$|He was courageous in battle, {{open and}} straightforward, incorruptible and impeccable, and strict towards himself. He {{cared about the}} masses, and was never {{concerned}} about his own advantage. He was never afraid of difficulties, neither of carrying heavy loads. In his revolutionary work, he was dilligent, <b>honest,</b> and he had an utmost sense of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|His {{thinking}} threw {{light in}} a very introspective way on the entire process of the judicial function. His decisions, beyond just the vote they represented, were sufficiently philosophical to be of enduring interest. He decided the case before him with that respect for its particulars, its special features, that marks alike the <b>honest</b> artist and the just judge.|$|E

5|$|I {{should not}} be {{surprised}} if this were to terminate in my death. I did not expect to encounter what has beset me since my elevation to the Presidency. God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be an <b>honest</b> duty. But I have been mistaken. My motives have been misconstrued, and my feelings most grossly outraged.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Michael, Dwight, Jim and Karen {{attend a}} {{cocktail}} party at CFO David Wallace's house. While there, Michael and Jan make their relationship public, Karen makes Jim uncomfortable by pointing out all of her ex-boyfriends in attendance, and Dwight inspects the home. Meanwhile, {{the rest of the}} office goes to a bar and Pam tries to be more <b>honest</b> with Roy.|$|E
5|$|Section 1(3) of the 1971 Act {{specifies}} that offences {{under section}} 1, where the destruction or damage {{is caused by}} fire, shall be charged as arson. It would seem that courts adopt a purposive view {{in relation to the}} lawful excuse defence in relation to arson, as in R v. Hunt (1977). The defendant, wishing to highlight the lack of fire defences in an old people's home, set fire to it to demonstrate the risks. He claimed an <b>honest</b> belief in that by doing this, he had a lawful excuse within section 5(2). It was held, however, that he had not actually been acting so as to protect property. Although the court assumed that his belief was <b>honest,</b> it ruled that his intention was to draw attention to faulty fire defences rather than to defend the property itself.|$|E
5|$|Since our blessed Lord, {{instead of}} a rich and honourable station in this world, was pleased to choose his lot among men of the lower condition; let not those, on whom the bounty of Providence hath {{bestowed}} wealth and honours, despise the men who are placed in a humble and inferior station; but rather, with their utmost power, by their countenance, by their protection, by just payment of their <b>honest</b> labour, encourage their daily endeavours {{for the support of}} themselves and their families. On the other hand, let the poor labour to provide things <b>honest</b> in the sight of all men; and so, with diligence in their several employments, live soberly, righteously, and godlily in this present world, that they may obtain that glorious reward promised in the Gospel to the poor, I mean the kingdom of Heaven.|$|E

Siva befriends {{a group of students}} and falls in love with Asha, sister of the <b>honest</b> police inspector Venkat.|$|E
5|$|Staszic was {{remembered by}} his contemporaries as a loner {{and not a}} person who was quick to make friends. He has been {{described}} as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear old clothes and use an old carriage. He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries. He was seen as stern but <b>honest,</b> and had a tendency to speak in a fashion that some found amusing.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of whether selection of signals works {{at the level of}} the individual organism or gene, or {{at the level of the}} group, has been debated by biologists such as Richard Dawkins, arguing that individuals evolve to signal and to receive signals better, including resisting manipulation. Amotz Zahavi suggested that cheating could be controlled by the handicap principle, where the best horse in a handicap race is the one carrying the largest handicap weight. According to Zahavi's theory, signallers such as male peacocks have 'tails' that are genuinely handicaps, being costly to produce. The system is evolutionarily stable as the large showy tails are <b>honest</b> signals. Biologists have attempted to verify the handicap principle, but with inconsistent results. The mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher analysed the contribution that having two copies of each gene (diploidy) would make to <b>honest</b> signalling, demonstrating that a runaway effect could occur in sexual selection. The evolutionary equilibrium depends sensitively on the balance of costs and benefits.|$|E
5|$|Warning calls {{given by}} birds {{such as the}} Eurasian jay are {{similarly}} <b>honest</b> signals, benefiting both predator and prey: the predator is informed {{that it has been}} detected and might as well save time and energy by giving up the chase, while the prey is protected from attack.|$|E
5|$|Warren {{convened a}} meeting of the justices, and {{presented}} to them the simple argument that the only reason to sustain segregation was an <b>honest</b> belief in the inferiority of Negroes. Warren further submitted that the Court must overrule Plessy to maintain its legitimacy as an institution of liberty, and it must do so unanimously to avoid massive Southern resistance. He began to build a unanimous opinion.|$|E
