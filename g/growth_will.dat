If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand <b>growth</b> <b>will</b> only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.|$|E

The town has also a growing commuter population as it is located on the Midland Main Line railway, operated by , which has InterCity trains to London St Pancras International station taking under an hour, giving an interchange with Eurostar services.|$|E
25|$|Real GDP {{growth is}} {{expected}} to average 5.5% in the 2009–13 period, seen the prospects in the tourism and the non-agricultural industry, as demand growth in the Eurozone — Morocco's key export market and source of tourists is projected to be more subdued. <b>Growth</b> <b>will</b> be well below the 8–10% levels that are widely regarded as necessary {{to have a major}} impact on poverty and unemployment.

25|$|Another {{element in}} the {{immigration}} debate is a concern to alleviate adverse impacts arising from Australia's aging population. The former Federal Treasurer, Peter Costello has said that Australia is underpopulated due to a low birth rate, and that negative population <b>growth</b> <b>will</b> have adverse long-term effects on the economy as the population ages and the labour market becomes less competitive. To avoid this outcome the government increased immigration to fill gaps in labour markets and introduced a subsidy to encourage families to have more children. However, opponents of population growth such as Sustainable Population Australia do not accept that population <b>growth</b> <b>will</b> decline and reverse, based on current immigration and fertility projections.|$|E

Some demographers argue that life expectancy will improve more than projected by the Social Security Trustees, a development that would make solvency worse. Some economists believe future productivity <b>growth</b> <b>will</b> be higher than the current projections by the Social Security Trustees. In this case, the Social Security shortfall would be smaller than currently projected.|$|E
25|$|Economic growth: Ontario's GDP {{growth has}} varied between 2% and 3% in recent years, and is {{expected}} to average 3.0% over the next few years. Although electricity per unit of GDP has been falling in the past few years, the total rate of economic <b>growth</b> <b>will</b> result in increased overall demand. This overall increase, however, is significantly smaller than the rate of economic or population growth, showing that electricity demand is decoupled from these two growth rates, a pattern that is recently being replicated in other areas of Canada and other G7 countries.|$|E

We develop a multi-period dynamic model in which managers decide in each period how much to invest in improving process reliability. The optimal investment decision will minimize the firm’s total costs, which are comprised of its pre-ventive costs and failure costs. We explicitly characterize the optimal investment scheme under different output growth projections and where the firm considers project obsolescence and investment salvageability.

25|$|Advocates of neo-liberal {{economics}} {{argue that}} while import substitution policies might create {{jobs in the}} short run, as domestic producers replace foreign producers, neoliberal theory believes {{that in the long}} run output and <b>growth</b> <b>will</b> be lower than it would otherwise have been. This is because import substitution denies the country the benefits to be gained from specialisation and foreign imports. The theory of comparative advantage shows how countries will gain from trade. Moreover, protectionism leads to dynamic inefficiency: Domestic producers have no incentive from foreign competitors to reduce costs or improve products. Import substitution can impede growth through poor allocation of resources, and its effect on exchange rates harms exports.|$|E
