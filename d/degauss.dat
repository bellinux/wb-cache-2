5000|$|Many {{televisions}} {{and monitors}} automatically <b>degauss</b> their picture tube when switched on, before an image is displayed. The high current surge {{that takes place}} during this automatic <b>degauss</b> {{is the cause of}} an audible [...] "thunk" [...] or loud hum, which can be heard (and felt) when televisions and CRT computer monitors are switched on. Visually, this causes the image to shake dramatically {{for a short period of}} time. A <b>degauss</b> option is also usually available for manual selection in the operations menu in such appliances.|$|E
25|$|The <b>degaussing</b> circuit {{is often}} built of a thermo-electric (not electronic) device {{containing}} a small ceramic heating element {{and a positive}} thermal coefficient (PTC) resistor, connected directly to the switched AC power line with the resistor in series with the <b>degaussing</b> coil. When the power is switched on, the heating element heats the PTC resistor, increasing its resistance {{to a point where}} <b>degaussing</b> current is minimal, but not actually zero. In older CRT displays, this low-level current (which produces no significant <b>degaussing</b> field) is sustained along with the action of the heating element as long as the display remains switched on. To repeat a <b>degaussing</b> cycle, the CRT display must be switched off and left off for at least several seconds to reset the <b>degaussing</b> circuit by allowing the PTC resistor to cool to the ambient temperature; switching the display-off and immediately back on will result in a weak <b>degaussing</b> cycle or effectively no <b>degaussing</b> cycle.|$|R

[...] When the display unit is {{initially}} switched on, current {{flows through the}} thermistor and <b>degaussing</b> coil. [...] The coil and thermistor are intentionally sized so that the current flow will heat the thermistor {{to the point that}} the <b>degaussing</b> coil shuts off in under a second. [...] For effective <b>degaussing,</b> it is necessary that the magnitude of the alternating magnetic field produced by the <b>degaussing</b> coil decreases smoothly and continuously, rather than sharply switching off or decreasing in steps; the PTC thermistor accomplishes this naturally as it heats up. [...] A <b>degaussing</b> circuit using a PTC thermistor is simple, reliable (for its simplicity), and inexpensive.|$|R
2500|$|Most color CRT displays, i.e. {{television}} sets and computer monitors, {{each have a}} built-in <b>degaussing</b> (demagnetizing) circuit, the primary component {{of which is a}} <b>degaussing</b> coil which is mounted {{around the perimeter of the}} CRT face inside the [...] Upon power-up of the CRT display, the <b>degaussing</b> circuit produces a brief, alternating current through the <b>degaussing</b> coil which smoothly decays in strength (fades out) to zero over a period of a few seconds, producing a decaying alternating magnetic field from the coil. This <b>degaussing</b> field is strong enough to remove shadow mask magnetization in most cases. In unusual cases of strong magnetization where the internal <b>degaussing</b> field is not sufficient, the shadow mask may be <b>degaussed</b> externally with a stronger portable degausser or demagnetizer. However, an excessively strong magnetic field, whether alternating or constant, may mechanically deform (bend) the shadow mask, causing a permanent color distortion on the display which looks very similar to a magnetization effect.|$|R

50|$|To {{minimize}} this, CRTs have a copper, or {{often in}} the case of cheaper appliances, aluminum, coil wrapped around the front of the display, known as the degaussing coil. Tubes without an internal coil can be degaussed using an external handheld version. Internal degaussing coils in CRTs are generally much weaker than external degaussing coils, since a better degaussing coil takes up more space. A <b>degauss</b> causes a magnetic field inside the tube to oscillate rapidly, with decreasing amplitude. This leaves the shadow mask with a small and somewhat randomized field, removing the discoloration.|$|E
25|$|This simple {{design is}} {{effective}} and cheap to build, but it wastes some power continuously.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{efficient}} fault detection method for onboard <b>degaussing</b> coils which are installed to min-imize underwater magnetic fields {{due to the}} ferromagnetic hull.

50|$|Erasure via <b>degaussing</b> may be {{accomplished}} in two ways: in AC erasure, the medium is <b>degaussed</b> by applying an alternating field that is reduced in amplitude over time from an initial high value (i.e., AC powered); in DC erasure, the medium is saturated by applying a unidirectional field (i.e., DC powered or by employing a permanent magnet).

40|$|Abstract. The LatinSat-A and –B {{spacecraft}} {{were launched}} into low Earth orbit in December of 2002. Built by SpaceQuest, these 11 kg microsatellites carry commercial UHF payloads. Their attitude control systems employ a novel magnetic actuator {{that can provide}} large torques while using very little power. At {{the core of the}} device is a rod of Alnico alloy, capable of storing a 13 Am 2 magnetic dipole. Copper windings around this rod connect to a high-voltage pulse generator. High power pulses can <b>degauss</b> or permanently reverse the polarity of the magnet. A hall-effect sensor provides magnetic field telemetry to the flight computer, and allows for closed-loop control. Once the polarity of the rod is set, no additional power is required to maintain it. Previous SpaceQuest microsatellites have used permanent magnets in their ACS to align them with the Earth’s field. These spacecraft complete two pitch rotations per orbit, so that the side that faces the Earth over the northern hemisphere faces space over the southern hemisphere. The LatinSats can <b>degauss</b> and then reverse their magnets each time they pass over the magnetic equator. This should allow a single side to face the Earth at all times...|$|E

40|$|Gyro {{is one of}} {{the major}} parts of the space vehicle. Gyro is used to measure the {{rotational}} rate of the space vehicle. One of the Laser technologies is used in the gyro. The laser beam must be incident on the photo diode without any abstraction. If any magnetic field is present, the laser beam is bending. But it must be avoided. But sometimes due to external influences gyro will effect by the magnetic field. So, we need to demagnetize the gyro. To demagnetizing the gyro, one method is used namely known as degaussing. Degaussing is the process of decreasing or eliminating an unwanted magnetic field. But it is generally not possible to reduce a magnetic field completely to zero, so degaussing typically induces a very small "known " field referred to as bias. The original method of degaussing was to install electromagnetic coils into system, known simply as coiling. The paper is how to <b>degauss</b> the gyro using microcontroller AT 90 S 2313. To degaussing the gyro, applied voltage time must be controlled. This is achieved by pulse width modulation by changing the duty cycle. In PWM, the period remains Constant, but the duty cycle changes. For PWM wave generation, the count for the total period is calculated and the ON time is subtracted from it to get the off time, this is given by T=Ton +Toff. Once pwm wave is generated it must be amplified by the power amplifier because the magnetic coil has a low resistance. Due to this it draws more power; if we connect the coils directly to the microcontroller it cannot supply such amount of power. For this purpose L 6203 full bridge power amplifier is used. Power on reset is a process of reset the micro controller before functioning. Generally every micro controller has a prescribed voltage level. If voltage fallen below the prescribed level it must be shut down. For this purpose ADM 706 supervisory circuit is used...|$|E

25|$|The {{dynamics}} of PTC thermistors being powered also is extremely useful. When first {{connected to a}} voltage source, a large current corresponding to the low, cold, resistance flows, but as the thermistor self-heats, the current is reduced until a limiting current (and corresponding peak device temperature) is reached. The current-limiting effect can replace fuses. They are also used in the <b>degaussing</b> circuits of many CRT monitors and televisions where the <b>degaussing</b> coil only has to be connected in series with an appropriately chosen thermistor; a particular advantage is that the current decrease is smooth, producing optimum degausing effect.
