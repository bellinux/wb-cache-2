30|$|In Germany, {{becoming}} a certified auditor (comparable to a CPA) requires passing an exam on four topics: auditing, business administration, commercial law, and taxation. The state <b>examination</b> <b>for</b> auditors enables auditors, once qualified, to advise non-listed corporate clients on various issues including taxation. However, {{it is common}} practice for auditors to also take a state <b>examination</b> specifically <b>for</b> taxation {{so they can be}} fully certified chartered tax consultants. This particular exam goes beyond tax issues dealt with in the state <b>examination</b> <b>for</b> auditors and is very challenging. The failure rate regularly lies at around 50 %. This exam {{can be seen as a}} further education of auditors that broadens individual auditors’ knowledge and allows to differentiate among auditors. Consequently, since this tax certification expands the knowledge acquired with the audit examination, audit exam candidates who have already passed the state <b>examination</b> <b>for</b> chartered tax consultants are permitted to bypass the exam on taxation. However, candidates <b>for</b> the state <b>examination</b> <b>for</b> chartered tax consultants who are already certified auditors may only bypass the accounting portion of the state <b>examination</b> <b>for</b> tax consultants.|$|R
