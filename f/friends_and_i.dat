It happened overnight and I couldn't think of anything but our friends and our situation.

500|$|Lexie entertained several {{relationships}} {{throughout her}} time on Grey's Anatomy. In her early appearances, she maintained {{a friendship with}} George O'Malley, until developing romantic feelings towards him. Rhimes offered the insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They’re really good <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can see the friendship evolving into something even greater. At least, that's what Lexie is hoping. She is my kind of girl. The girl who likes the guy {{because he is a}} GOOD guy and that's what George is. He is a good guy and that's something that Lexie could use now. She's going through her own challenges what with Meredith and losing her own mother and trying to keep things afloat. I’m rooting for Lexie. She's my kind of girl and I hope that she gets what she deserves: love. And more kisses. There should always be that." [...] Lexie's most significant relationship was with Mark Sloan. Following her death, Rhimes said: ...|$|E
500|$|Knight felt a {{parallel}} to George in that his [...] "confidence isn't always at its absolute highest", but overall he sees more differences than similarities. However, when the actor starts {{to think he}} is so different from O'Malley, an awkward move can suggest otherwise. [...] "I was walking, doing a scene with Katherine Heigl. I finished my line with her, and then I walked straight into the light stand." [...] Critical of her affair with O'Malley, Knight's co-star Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it." [...] Speaking of O'Malley's relationship with Lexie, Rhimes offered her insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends.

500|$|Stead {{finds that}} kids today {{are much less}} {{independent}} since her childhood. She wrote, [...] "rom age nine, my <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were on the streets, walking home, going to each other's houses, going to the store. I really {{wanted to write about}} that: the independence that's a little bit scary but also a really positive thing in a lot of ways. And I'm not sure that most kids have that today". Throughout the novel, Miranda and her friends often walk around town without any adults. They are even found working in a sandwich store at lunch and walking home from school while trying to avoid the laughing man. While writing the novel, Stead hoped to show her sons the time period in which she lived, [...] "send them on a little time-travel journey of their own". Laura Miller of The New Yorker found that this lack of independence in today's youth is mainly {{due to the fact that}} kids now grow up with adults constantly watching them.

2500|$|Sturgis {{continued}} to write novels during the 1880s. [...] They were My <b>Friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> (1884), John Maidment (1885), Thraldom (1887), and The Comedy of a Country House (1889). Reviewing {{the second of}} these, The Manchester Guardian said, [...] "Readers of Little Comedies know how patiently and ingeniously Mr. Sturgis can draw what may be called the minor scoundrel – the scoundrel whose scoundrelism is so successfully concealed from the world and from himself {{that it is only}} a few people who know him to be a scoundrel at all. [...] He has made a fresh and more audacious study of this type in John Maidment, a study audacious but successful." ...|$|E

There were officials with the cricket association who I regarded as good <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had drinks with them whenever I was in Sydney or whenever they were in Newcastle.

2500|$|She {{was born}} Wanda Gertz von Schliess in Warsaw, the {{daughter}} of Jana and Florentyny Gertz von Schliess.
