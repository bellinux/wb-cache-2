Shulgin performed seminal work into the descriptive synthesis of many of these compounds. Some of Shulgin's noteworthy discoveries include compounds of the 2C* family (such as 2C-B) and compounds of the DOx family (such as DOM).|$|E
500|$|When Goebel's son, Paul G. Goebel, Jr., ran for Ford's Congressional seat in 1974, then President Ford {{returned}} to Grand Rapids {{to campaign for}} Goebel's son. Ford delivered a speech at Calvin College in Grand Rapids {{the week before the}} election in which he said: [...] "Paul Goebel <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> since he was just a lad. His dad knew me when I was back at South High—an inspired if not very competent football player. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> the Goebel family a long time, and they are strong and they are tall, and they are {{the kind of people who}} are dedicated to public service. Paul, Jr.'s, father was; Paul, Jr., himself is. And I have seen nothing but the finest in that family, and young Paul, he epitomizes all the great characteristics of that family." ...|$|E

500|$|Seton's {{intention}} {{in writing}} his stories was to [...] "freely translate" [...] the animals' language into English, as they [...] "have no speech {{as we understand}} it". The stories were typically prefaced by the author's strong assertion of their accuracy, and Wild Animals <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Known</b> marked the nature writer's first emphasis on {{the perspective of a}} wild animal. As Canadian poet and author Charles G.D. Roberts described it, the genre focused on [...] "the personality, individuality, mentality, of an animal, as well as its purely physical characteristics." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Gandhi {{stated that}} his [...] "sympathies are {{all with the}} Jews. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> them intimately in South Africa. Some of them became life-long companions." [...] Philosopher Martin Buber was highly {{critical}} of Gandhi's approach and in 1939 wrote {{an open letter to}} him on the subject. Gandhi reiterated his stance that [...] "the Jews seek to convert the Arab heart", and use [...] "satyagraha in confronting the Arabs" [...] in 1947. According to Simone Panter-Brick, Gandhi's political position on Jewish-Arab conflict evolved over the 1917-1947 period, shifting from a support for the Arab position first, and for the Jewish position in the 1940s.|$|E
500|$|Cricket saw an {{increase}} in defensive play during the 1950s. As a selector, Bradman favoured attacking, positive cricketers who entertained the paying public. He formed an alliance with Australian captain Richie Benaud, seeking more attractive play, with some success. He served two high-profile periods {{as chairman of the}} board of Control, in 1960–63 and 1969–72. During the first, he dealt with the growing prevalence of illegal bowling actions in the game, a problem that he adjudged [...] "the most complex <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> in cricket, because it is not a matter of fact but of opinion". The major controversy of his second stint was a proposed tour of Australia by South Africa in 1971–72. On Bradman's recommendation, the series was cancelled. Cricket journalist Michael Coward said of Bradman as an administrator: ...|$|E

500|$|During {{his year}} at Cape Flora Bruce {{collected}} around 700 zoological specimens, in often very disagreeable conditions. According to Jackson: [...] "It is no pleasant job to dabble in icy-cold water, with the thermometer some degrees below zero, or to plod {{in the summer}} through snow, slush and mud many miles in search of animal life, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> Mr Bruce frequently to do". Jackson named Cape Bruce after him, on {{the northern edge of}} Northbrook Island, at 80°55′N. Jackson was less pleased with Bruce's proprietarial attitude to his personal specimens, which he refused to entrust to the British Museum with the expedition's other finds. This [...] "tendency towards scientific conceit", and lack of tact in interpersonal dealings, were early demonstrations of character flaws that in later life would be held against him.|$|E
500|$|Bathurst and Thomas express {{contrasting}} {{views on}} the significance of Stroma's abandonment. Thomas regards it as a tragedy: [...] "Of all the out-of-the-way places <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>known,</b> this was the saddest. It seemed as though its life had been ended {{in a fit of}} pique." [...] To Bathurst, however, [...] "it is tempting to see Stroma's abandonment as the result of some appalling trauma. Abandonment is always taken as a sign of failure, a collective death... But Stroma does not feel sad. True, there is sorrow in seeing the once meticulous vegetable patches turned over to weeds, or wondering how many more winters the box beds will stand before they start to rot. But that isn't the whole story. What is interesting about Stroma is not the fact of its abandonment, but the tale of its past." ...|$|E
500|$|McCain {{had been}} uncomfortable and largely silent during the 1998 Lewinsky scandal, partly because his own {{personal}} life had not been without blemishes, and partly because his upcoming presidential nomination run restricted his political options. [...] During the early 1999 Impeachment of Bill Clinton, McCain voted to convict the president on both the perjury {{and obstruction of justice}} counts. [...] In his remarks on the Senate floor, McCain said: [...] "Although I may admit to failures in my private life, I have [...] kept faith with every oath I have ever sworn to this country. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> some men who kept that faith at the cost of their lives. I cannot—not in deference to public opinion, or for political considerations, or for the sake of comity and friendship—I cannot agree to expect less from the President." ...|$|E

500|$|The Skinker family {{announced}} that any gentleman who [...] "would {{take her to}} his bed after loyall Matrimony" [...] would receive a dowry of £40,000. The dowry, a huge sum for the time, prompted {{a large number of}} would-be husbands. A Scottish captain arrived, having spent the greater part of a month's pay on a new suit, and was taken by Tannakin's figure and deportment. On lifting the veil to view her face, however, [...] "hee would stay no other conference, but ran away without further answer, saying; they must pardon him, for hee could indure no Porke." [...] An English sow-man (pig farmer) assured the family that his familiarity with pigs meant he would accept Tannakin's appearance, but after meeting her he left the building, saying that [...] "so long as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> Rumford, I never saw such a Hogsnout".|$|E
500|$|As a man, Richardson {{was on the}} {{one hand}} deeply private and on the other flamboyantly unconventional. Frank Muir said of him, [...] "It's the Ralphdom of Ralph that one has to cling to; he wasn't really quite like other people." [...] In Coveney's phrase, [...] "His oddness was ever startling and never {{hardened}} into mere eccentricity." [...] Richardson would introduce colleagues to his ferrets by name, ride at high speed on his powerful motor-bike in his seventies, have a parrot flying round his study eating his pencils, or take a pet mouse out for a stroll, but behind such unorthodox behaviour there was a closely guarded self who remained an enigma to even his closest colleagues. Tynan wrote in The New Yorker that Richardson [...] "made me feel that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> this man all my life and that I have never met anyone who more adroitly buttonholed me while keeping me firmly at arm's length." ...|$|E
500|$|Barney herself {{contributed a}} chapter to Idylle Saphique {{in which she}} {{described}} reclining at de Pougy's feet in a screened box at the theater, watching Sarah Bernhardt's play Hamlet. During intermission, Barney (as [...] "Flossie") compares Hamlet's plight with that of women: [...] "What is there for women who feel the passion for action when pitiless Destiny holds them in chains? Destiny made us women {{at a time when}} the law of men is the only law that is recognized." [...] She also wrote Lettres à une Connue (Letters to a Woman <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Known),</b> her own epistolary novel about the affair. Although Barney failed to find a publisher for the book and later called it naïve and clumsy, it is notable for its discussion of homosexuality, which Barney regarded as natural and compared to albinism. [...] "My queerness," [...] she said, [...] "is not a vice, is not deliberate, and harms no one." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{controversy}} {{arose from}} a new literary movement, which followed a growth {{of interest in the}} natural world beginning in the late 19th century, and in which the natural world was depicted in a compassionate rather than realistic light. Works such as Ernest Thompson Seton's Wild Animals <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Known</b> (1898) and William J. Long's School of the Woods (1902) popularized this new genre and emphasized sympathetic and individualistic animal characters. In March 1903, naturalist and writer John Burroughs published an article entitled [...] "Real and Sham Natural History" [...] in The Atlantic Monthly. Lambasting writers such as Seton, Long, and Charles G. D. Roberts for their seemingly fantastical representations of wildlife, he also denounced the booming genre of realistic animal fiction as [...] "yellow journalism of the woods". Burroughs' targets responded in defense of their work in various publications, as did their supporters, and the resulting controversy raged in the public press for nearly six years.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Lloyd {{signed with}} {{expansion}} team Atlanta Beat for the 2011 season. Of her signing, Beat head coach James Galanis said, [...] "She {{is a fantastic}} midfielder and someone who is fully focused on the game. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> her from her college days, and I {{have had the opportunity}} to train her and improve her game individually. She has made a lot of sacrifices off the field to reach her dreams, and she is going to bring a lot of professionalism to the team." [...] Lloyd scored two goals in her ten appearances for the Beat. She scored the team's lone goal in a 4–1 defeat by the Boston Breakers on April 9. Her second goal on the season was an equalizer during the 70th minute of a 2–2 draw against the Western New York Flash. The Beat finished their first season in last place with a 1–4–13 record.|$|E
500|$|In March 1903, Burroughs {{submitted}} a scathing essay to The Atlantic Monthly entitled [...] "Real and Sham Natural History"; the editor, Bliss Perry, reportedly found the piece so [...] "ill-natured" [...] and [...] "peevish" [...] {{that he sent}} it back to Burroughs for revisions. Burroughs began his article with praise for authors such as Ingersoll, Frank M. Chapman and Florence Merriam Bailey, all of whom he believed exemplified good nature writing. Championing his own strict adherence to observed fact, Burroughs singled out four books for criticism: Seton's Wild Animals <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>Known,</b> Roberts' The Kindred of the Wild, William Davenport Hulbert's Forest Neighbours, and Long's School of the Woods. In particular he blamed Seton's collection of stories for founding the sentimental animal story genre; he even amended {{the title of the}} collection to Wild Animals I Alone Have Known. Further denouncing Seton's claims that his stories featured events and behaviors he had personally witnessed, Burroughs wrote: ...|$|E

500|$|After the 2009 Afghan presidential election, Afghan President Karzai's {{views about}} the {{security}} issues confronting Afghanistan {{and how best to}} deal with them reportedly changed. This impacted the working relationship between the President of Afghanistan and some of his cabinet ministers including his intelligence chief. Saleh said, [...] "He [...] thought democracy had hurt him as a person. His family had been attacked by the media unfairly, and the West was criticizing him unfairly. So after a presidential election, he was a changed man, and we could not have the same relationship as before the presidential election." [...] Political analyst Ahmed Rashid in 2010 observed the same, [...] "Karzai's new outlook is the most dramatic political shift he has undergone in the twenty-six years that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> him." [...] Both Saleh and Interior Minister Hanif Atmar subsequently had strong disagreements with Karzai on how to proceed against the Taliban, who Karzai began referring to as [...] "brothers". At that point Saleh and Atmar were increasingly isolated in the Karzai administration.|$|E
500|$|Author and {{illustrator}} Ernest Thompson Seton {{published his}} first book, the bestselling Wild Animals <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Known,</b> in 1898. The first entry {{in a new}} genre of realistic wild-animal stories, Seton's {{collection of short stories}} quickly {{became one of the most}} popular books of its day. Although he had considered himself [...] "a naturalist of the usual type, trying merely to accumulate specimens and facts" [...] during his early career, he later began to write factual material [...] "in the form of romantic stories—fiction in the form of presentation, but solid in fact in their basis and their message." [...] The first story in the collection, [...] "Lobo, The King of Currumpaw" [...] was based upon Seton's experience hunting wolves in the Southwest. It became a classic, setting the tone for his future works that would similarly depict animals—especially predators who were often demonized in literature—as compassionate, individualistic beings. Seton was reportedly denounced by readers for having killed Lobo, only to write about the experience; however, as biographer Brian Morris stated, the readers' sympathies [...] "are directed, as Seton meant them to be, toward the wild animal, rather than against the teller of the tale".|$|E
