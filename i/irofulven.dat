50|$|<b>Irofulven</b> or 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (also {{known as}} HMAF of MGI-114) is an {{experimental}} antitumor agent. It {{belongs to the}} family of drugs called alkylating agents.|$|E
50|$|The drug has {{undergone}} a number of clinical trials, mostly for late-stage tumors as well as ovarian and prostate cancers, usually preceded by treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel. A multi-center phase 2 trial involving patients with Recurrent or Persistent Ovarian Epithelial or Primary Peritoneal Cancer was well tolerated but irofluven demonstrated modest activity as a single agent. Previously, a European Phase I study in combination with cisplatin showed substantial evidence for anti-tumor activity. In that study, <b>irofulven</b> showed rapid elimination and high interpatient variability. Platinum and <b>irofulven</b> pharmacokinetics did not suggest drug-drug interactions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Irofulven</b> is an {{analogue}} of illudin S, a sesquiterpene toxin {{found in}} the Jack o Lantern mushroom (Omphalotus illudens). The compound was originally synthesized by Dr. Trevor McMorris and found to have anticancer properties in mice by Dr. Michael J Kelner.|$|E
50|$|Lentinan, PSK, and PSP, are {{registered}} anticancer immunologic adjuvants. <b>Irofulven</b> and acylfulvene are anticancer derivatives of illudin S. Clavaric acid is a reversible farnesyltransferase inhibitor. Inonotus obliquus creates betulinic acid precursor betulin. Flammulina velutipes creates asparaginase. Plinabulin is a fungal isolate derivative currently being researched for anticancer applications.|$|E

[...] One important acylfulvene, 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (<b>irofulven),</b> has been evaluated {{for the treatment of}} a wide assortment of cancers and tumors. [...] It is thought that acylfulvene compounds kill cancer cells by DNA alkylation (see DNA methylation).|$|E
50|$|Inside cells, illudin is {{chemically}} {{changed to}} react with DNA, thus creating an unknown type of DNA damage that blocks the transcription process.

50|$|Extracts {{of several}} species of Australian {{mushrooms}} have been investigated for cytotoxicity to cancer cells; material from O. nidiformis showed marked toxicity to gastric (AGS), colon (HT-29) and estrogen-independent breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell lines. <b>Irofulven,</b> a compound derived from illuden S, is undergoing phase II clinical trials as a possible therapy for various types of cancers.

50|$|Despite modest successes demonstrating limited {{efficacy}} {{for late}} stage tumors that were statistically not significant {{enough to support}} broader clinical trials, Oncology Venture has decided to stratify patient populations with companion diagnostic tools (biomarkers) to predict outcomes, and thus select that sub-set of patients through DRP (Drug Response Predictors), for whom treatment with <b>irofulven</b> would be most effective. Oncology Venture Sweden AB has initiated two Phase 2 drug-screening studies at two Danish University Hospitals for late-stage prostate cancers, wherein 300 patients have been included to be screened, of which only 15 are to be selected for the Phase 2 trial.|$|E
50|$|The {{poisonous}} {{chemical compounds}} illudin S and illudin M were isolated from Omphalotus illudens. In {{addition to their}} antibacterial and antifungal effects, illudins {{appear to be the}} cause of human toxicity when these mushrooms are eaten raw or cooked. Muscarine has also been indirectly implicated in toxicity, but modern studies to demonstrate its presence in O. illudens are needed. The cytotoxic effect of illudin is of interest for treating some cancers, but illudin itself is too poisonous to use directly so it must first be chemically modified. Inside human cells, illudin S reacts with DNA and creates a type of DNA damage that blocks transcription. This block can only be relieved by a repair system called nucleotide excision repair. Damage in non-transcribed DNA areas is left unrepaired by the cell. This property was exploited by the company MGI Pharma to develop an illudin-derivative called <b>Irofulven</b> for use as a cancer treatment. Its application is still in the experimental phase.|$|E
40|$|<b>Irofulven</b> (hydroxymethylacylfulvene) {{is a novel}} {{antitumor}} drug, {{which acts}} by alkylating cellular macromolecular tar-gets. The drug is a potent inducer of apoptosis in various types of tumor cells, whereas it is nonapoptotic in normal cells. This study defined molecular responses to <b>irofulven</b> involving mitochondrial dysfunction and leading to death of prostate tumor LNCaP-Pro 5 cells. <b>Irofulven</b> caused early (2 – 5 hours) translocation of the proapoptotic Bax from cytosol to mitochondria followed by the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c re-lease at 4 to 12 hours. These effects preceded caspase activation and during the first 6 hours were not affected by caspase inhibitors.

40|$|International audienceTranscription-coupled repair (TCR) plays a {{key role}} in the repair of DNA lesions induced by bulky adducts and is {{initiated}} when the elongating RNA polymerase II (Pol II) stalls at DNA lesions. This is accompanied by alterations in Pol II activity and stability. We have previously shown that the monofunctional adducts formed by <b>irofulven</b> (6 -hydroxymethylacylfulvene) are exclusively recognized by TCR, without involvement of global genome repair (GGR), making <b>irofulven</b> a unique tool to characterize TCR-associated processes in vivo. Here, we characterize the influence of <b>irofulven</b> on Pol II activity, stability and mobility in living mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that <b>irofulven</b> induces specific inhibition of nucleoplasmic RNA synthesis, an important decrease of Pol II mobility, coupled to the accumulation of initiating polymerase and a time-dependent loss of the engaged enzyme, associated with its polyubiquitylation. Both proteasome-mediated degradation of the stalled polymerase and new protein synthesis are necessary to allow Pol II recycling into preinitiating complexes. Together, our findings provide novel insights into the subsequent fate of the stalled RNA polymerase II and demonstrate the essential role of the recycling process for transcriptional reinitiation and viability of mammalian cells...|$|E
40|$|<b>Irofulven</b> is {{currently}} in Phase 2 clinical trials against {{a wide variety of}} solid tumors and has demonstrated activity in ovarian, prostate, gastrointestinal, and non-small cell lung cancer. The objectives of this study were to determine its pharmacokinetics and route of excretion and to characterize its metabolites in human plasma and urine samples after a 30 -min i. v. infusion at a dose of 0. 55 mg/kg in patients with advanced solid tumors. Three patients were administered i. v. 100 microCi of [14 C]irofulven over a 30 -min infusion on day 1 of cycle 1. Serial blood and plasma samples were drawn at 0 (before <b>irofulven</b> infusion) and up to 144 h after the start of infusion. Urine and fecal samples were collected for up to 144 h after the start of infusion. The mean urinary and fecal excretion of radioactivity up to 144 h were 71. 2 and 2. 9 %, respectively, indicating renal excretion was the major route of elimination of [14 C]irofulven. The C(max), AUC(0 -infinity), and terminal half-life values for total radioactivity were 1130 ng-Eq/ml, 24, 400 ng-Eq. h/ml, and 116. 5 h, respectively, and the corresponding values for <b>irofulven</b> were 82. 7 ng/ml, 65. 5 ng. h/ml, and 0. 3 h, respectively, suggesting that the total radioactivity in human plasma was a result of the metabolites. Twelve metabolites of <b>irofulven</b> were detected in human urine and plasma by electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry. Among these metabolites, the cyclopropane ring-opened metabolite (M 2) of <b>irofulven</b> was found, and seven others were proposed as glucuronide and glutathione conjugates.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Irofulven</b> (6 -hydroxymethylacylfulvene) {{is a novel}} agent, {{derived from}} illudin S, with potent {{apoptotic}} effects in preclinical models. In the Phase I trial evaluating intermittent weekly schedules, visual symptoms were dose limiting. The aim of this analysis was to better characterize the visual adverse events of <b>irofulven</b> and provide treatment guidelines. Experimental Design: Clinical data from 277 patients entered in single-agent Phase I to II clinical trials who received <b>irofulven</b> on days 1 and 15 every 4 weeks; days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks; or days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks were included in this multiparameter analysis. Results: Overall, 74 patients (27 %) experienced visual symptoms. The most frequently reported symptoms were flashing lights (12 % of patients), blurred vision (9 %), and photosensitivity (8 %). Grade 3 toxicity was observed in 12 patients (4 %). The incidence and severity of visual events were dose dependent, with no grade 3 visual events occurring at doses {{less than or equal}} to 0. 50 mg/kg and grade 1 to 2 events in only 12 % and 8 % of patients, at doses of {{less than or equal to}} 0. 50 mg/kg and less than or equal to 20 mg/m(2), respectively. Grade I to 2 toxicity was reversible in most patients. Abnormal electroretinogram and abnormal visual fields were noted after <b>irofulven</b> treatment in 24 of 39 patients (62 %) and 15 of 26 patients (58 %), respectively. All but 1 patient who had electroretinogram assessment received doses > 0. 50 mg/kg. Clinical examination and visual field assessment were found to be better correlated with symptoms and appear to be more appropriate for surveillance of <b>irofulven</b> retinal symptoms than electroretinograms. Conclusions: On the basis of retained antitumor activity and reversibility of grade 1 and 2 visual symptoms at lower doses, it appears that an <b>irofulven</b> dose of less than or equal to 0. 50 mg/kg or less than or equal to 20 mg/m(2), not to exceed 50 mg in a single dose, given as a 30 -minute infusion on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks or days 1 and 15 every 4 weeks minimizes the frequency and severity of visual symptoms...|$|E
40|$|A {{strategy}} for the preparation of 3 -vinyl- 2 -alkylidene- 3 -cyclohexen- 1 -ones has been developed using an intramolecular rhodium(I) -catalyzed carbocyclization reaction of allene-ynones. Application of this strategy towards the preparation of analogs of the anticancer agent <b>irofulven</b> was realized, leading to highly functionalized spiro[2. 5]octatrienes. A novel approach to ε-lactams from allene-containing propargyl amides has been achieved, also using the rhodium(I) -catalyzed carbocyclization reaction. Further elaboration of this strategy has afforded triene-containing azepines and a pyrroloazepinone. A diverging diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) strategy using tryptophan as a key starting material was investigated. Constructon of allenic tetrahydro-β-carboline scaffolds via a Pictet-Spengler reaction and subsequent silver(I) -catalyzed cycloisomerization afforded tetrahydroindolizinoindoles. Conversion of the tetrahydro-β-carboline to an allenic propiolamide followed by a microwave-assisted allenic [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction provided tetrahydrocyclobutaindoloquinolizinones. An allene-yne substituted derivative of tryptophan gave indolylmethylazabicyclooctadiene when subjected to a microwave-assisted allenic [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. This same tryptophan-derived precursor afforded an indolylmethyldihydrocyclopentapyridinone when subjected to a rhodium(I) -catalyzed cyclocarbonylation reaction...|$|E
40|$|Exome {{sequencing}} {{was performed}} in three index cases with bone marrow failure and neurological dysfunction and whose parents are first-degree cousins. Homozygous truncating mutations were identified in ERCC 6 L 2 {{in two of the}} individuals. Both of these mutations affect the subcellular localization and stability of ERCC 6 L 2. We show here that knockdown of ERCC 6 L 2 in human A 549 cells significantly reduced their viability upon exposure to the DNA-damaging agents mitomycin C and <b>Irofulven,</b> but not etoposide and camptothecin, suggesting a role in nucleotide excision repair. ERCC 6 L 2 -knockdown cells also displayed H 2 AX phosphorylation, which significantly increased upon genotoxic stress, suggesting an early DNA-damage response. Intriguingly, ERCC 6 L 2 was seen to translocate to the mitochondria and the nucleus in response to DNA damage, and ERCC 6 L 2 knockdown induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Treatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine attenuated the Irofulven-induced cytotoxicity in ERCC 6 L 2 -knockdown cells and abolished ERCCGL 2 traffic to the mitochondria and nucleus in response to this DNA-damaging agent. Collectively, these observations identify a distinct bone-marrow-failure syndrome due to mutations in ERCC 6 L 2, a gene implicated in DNA repair and mitochondrial function. ...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{research}} {{dealing with}} binding {{agents in the}} minor groove of DNA. Minor groove binders (MGBs) are agents {{with the ability to}} specifically bind to specific DNA sequences. Together with DNA they form a stable complex. The degree of stability of this complex can be assessed from the change in the melting temperature of ligand/DNA complexes compared with free DNA. The structure of DNA is described in relation to its function and its importance. The basic properties of MGBs are mentioned and how they bond in the minor groove, i. e. the rules used by these agents for "reading" a DNA sequence. An overview is provided of the types of chemical structures, in particular the natural origin described in literature as MGBs. They are most commonly described with the occurring compounds, mainly those with clinical significance. The MGB-BP 3 compound is among the most interesting compounds with antibacterial activity, which is effective against the most common pathogens of nosocomial infections. Further development of the CC- 1065 analogues is also beneficial as anticancer drugs. Trabectedin has already been approved for use in cancer patients, and brostallicin and <b>irofulven</b> are undergoing clinical evaluation.

40|$|Illudin S is {{a natural}} {{sesquiterpene}} drug with strong anti-tumour activity. Inside cells, unstable active metabolites of illudin cause the formation of as yet poorly characterised DNA lesions. In order to identify factors involved in their repair, we have performed a detailed genetic survey of repair-defective mutants for responses to the drug. We show that 90 % of illudin's lethal effects in human fibroblasts can be prevented by an active nucleotide excision repair (NER) system. Core NER enzymes XPA, XPF, XPG, and TFIIH are essential for recovery. However, the presence of global NER initiators XPC, HR 23 A/HR 23 B and XPE is not required, whereas survival, repair and recovery from transcription inhibition critically depend on CSA, CSB and UVS, the factors specific for transcription-coupled NER. Base excision repair and non-homologous end-joining of DNA breaks do not {{play a major role}} in the processing of illudin lesions. However, active RAD 18 is required for optimal cell survival, indicating that the lesions also block replication forks, eliciting post-replication-repair-like responses. However, the translesion-polymerase DNA pol eta is not involved. We conclude that illudin-induced lesions are exceptional in that they appear to be ignored by all of the known global repair systems, and can only be repaired when trapped in stalled replication or transcription complexes. We show that the semisynthetic illudin derivative hydroxymethylacylfulvene (HMAF, <b>Irofulven),</b> currently under clinical trial for anti-tumour therapy, acts via the same mechanism...|$|E
40|$|AbstractElimination {{of cancer}} cells by early {{apoptosis}} is preferred over {{other forms of}} cell growth inhibition. Apoptosis directly leads to tumor regression and reduces risks of selecting more aggressive and/or drug-resistant phenotypes that are often responsible for tumor regrowth and treatment failure. Although DNA damage by anticancer drugs is commonly recognized as an apoptotic stimulus, there is enormous variability in the magnitude and timing of such effects. Especially potent and rapid apoptosis {{seems to be a}} hallmark of various alkylating anticancer drugs that are regarded as DNA-reactive agents but are observed to react mainly with cellular proteins. Our studies with such dual-action drugs (<b>irofulven,</b> oxaliplatin) suggest that not only DNA damage, but also protein damage, contributes to apoptosis induction. DNA damage is well known to initiate death-signaling pathways leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Protein damage, in turn, can distort cell redox homeostasis, which facilitates apoptosis execution. Such dual effects can be particularly lethal to tumor cells, which tend to function under pro-oxidative conditions. In contrast to tumor cells that are highly susceptible, normal cells show marginal apoptotic responses to the dual action drugs. This protection of normal cells might reflect their greater ability to buffer pro-oxidative changes and quickly restore redox homeostasis, despite substantial drug uptake and macromolecular binding. Importantly, by targeting the death process at multiple points, DNA- and protein-damaging drugs can be less vulnerable to various bypass mechanisms possible with single targets. The reviewed studies provide a proof of concept that differential apoptosis targeting in cancer versus normal cells can be a basis for tumor selectivity of anticancer drugs...|$|E
