40|$|Only {{one quarter}} of American {{students}} in Grades 4, 8, and 12 were considered {{at or above the}} proficient level in writing in 2002 and 2007. The purpose of this quantitative study was to identify the effect of the instructional strategy known as writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workshop</b> on students 2 ̆ 7 writing achievement. Writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workshop</b> is an instructional strategy involving daily writing and systematic lessons. The research question guiding this study examined the writing achievement of students taught through writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workshop</b> versus students taught through the county 2 ̆ 7 s writing curriculum which utilizes journal writing on a regular basis but does not involve systematic lessons or daily writing. Writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workshop</b> was implemented in 3 Kindergarten classrooms, totaling 45 students, and scores from these students were compared to the scores {{of the students in the}} control group, totaling 45 students, none of whom had been exposed to writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workshop.</b> The participants were 90 Kindergarten students enrolled in a suburban elementary school in the southeastern United States. The students were randomly placed in experimental and control conditions. A pre- and posttest derived from a 10 stage developmental writing rubric was used to measure writing achievement. An independent-measures t test on posttest scores determined a significant difference in writing achievement when the writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workshop</b> strategies were integrated into the curriculum.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} avant-garde {{films of the}} Barcelona School and Pere Portabella 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workshop</b> from 1957 to 1975. It challenges the long-held belief that the surrealist and dadaist film experiments produced by these groups are signs of their political disengagement under Francisco Franco 2 ̆ 7 s dictatorship at a pivotal period, known as the apertura or political opening, in Spain 2 ̆ 7 s modern history. This investigation examines {{the form of the}} cinematic loop in late Francoist film and shows how these fringe groups employ highly political strategies in their reappropriation of this form to expose the Francoist homogenizing, nationalist discourse and interrupt its proliferation. It studies the distinct approaches to filmmaking, the exhibition of and disruption to the Francoist cinematic loops, and the construction of an active spectator in the films of Jacinto Esteva Grewe, Joaquim Jordà, Vicente Aranda, Carlos Duran, José Maria Nunes, and Pere Portabella 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> interdisciplinary <b>workshop</b> involving Luis Buñuel, Joan Brossa, Caries Santos, and Joan Miró. ...|$|R

My goal was to incorporate the fine arts into second grade literacy curriculum {{to encourage students to}} become more enthusiastic about their writing.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effectiveness of the language experience approach (LEA) for teaching reading and writing skills to functionally illiterate high school students who were identified as learning disabled. Twenty-one 9 th-grade students ages fifteen to sixteen participated. The students were divided into a control group and an experimental group. The control group was instructed {{through the use of a}} commercial reading kit, Reader 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Workshop</b> I (1974). The experimental group received instruction using the LEA which uses student written material to generate reading skill activities. To verify effectiveness of the LEA, pre- and posttests of the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Test (1976), or SDRT, brown level, forms A and B and the Sentence Writing Strategy Pretest (1985), or SWSP, were administered to both the control and experimental groups. The results on the subtests of the SDRT indicated no significant gains or losses of reading skill ability for either group. The SWSP though, indicated a significant gain in sentence writing ability of 29 percentage points for the experimental group while the control group lost 11 percentage points. It is therefore evident that the language experience approach can be successful for teaching reading and writing skills to functionally illiterate high school students because it integrates reading and writing rather than providing detached skill instruction...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This poster will {{detail a}} few {{pedagogical}} techniques {{incorporated into a}} series of workshops on research data management. These techniques were chosen to better engage workshop participants by making the material more individually relevant and relatable. Methods: For the second semester in which workshops on research data management (derived from the NECDMC modules) were offered through the Brandeis University Library 2 ̆ 6 Technology Services department, the librarian sought to make the sessions more engaging through several pedagogical techniques. A team teaching approach was employed by inviting senior members of the Technology Help Desk and Hardware Repair Shop to collaborate on and co-teach the workshops. Humor was employed strategically through icons, disaster stories, and select xkcd webcomic strips within the lecture and slides. Informal polling and direct encouragement to share personal anecdotes during the workshop sessions promoted active engagement. Results: Workshop participants were visibly more engaged, asked a greater number of questions, and questions were more directly relevant to the presented material than participants of the first semester 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workshops,</b> before these pedagogical techniques were employed. Conclusions: Active and engaged learning techniques are difficult to employ in what are essentially one-shot hour-long instruction sessions, particularly when participants are largely unfamiliar with the material at hand. But by integrating some techniques to capture the interest and encourage participants to make connections to their own experiences we observed a deeper understanding and appreciation of the material...|$|R
