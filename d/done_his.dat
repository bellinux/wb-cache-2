5|$|The first {{scrutiny}} {{was held}} on December 3, the fifth day of the conclave in the Cappella Paolina (not the Sistine Chapel, which had been divided into nineteen cells for infirm cardinals). Because it took ten days for the news of Pope Paul III's death to reach the French court, {{at the start of}} the conclave almost all the cardinals aligned with the Holy Roman Empire were in Rome, while only two of the fourteen French cardinals were in Italy (one was Antoine du Meudon, who had been vacationing in Farnese territory); because one clause of the Concordat of Bologna allowed the pope to fill French benefices if the French prelate died in Rome, Henry II exhorted his cardinals to remain in France, and relied on his non-French allies (in particular, Ippolito II d'Este) to act as his go-between with the Roman Curia. d'Este had <b>done</b> <b>his</b> best to delay the start of the conclave to allow the French cardinals to arrive, using his influence to schedule the papal funerary rite (which was, by law, nine days long) to begin an unusual nine days after Paul III's death.|$|E

5|$|As {{the plans}} for three {{different}} versions of the game appeared, the staff realized {{that it was impossible to}} write three storylines in-house. After searching through known video game writers, they decided to consider writers in other fields. The writer suggested by Maeda was Shin Kibayashi, who was famous in Japan for his work on multiple manga and television series. Kibayashi was initially approached by Kozaki through their shared editor, and was pitched the project by the staff in December 2012. Kibayashi was going to refuse the project as he had a tight work schedule, but after both he and his daughter played through a copy of Awakening provided by staff, Kibayashi decided to accept and wrote an initial draft story. Despite his initial minimal commitment of a ten-page summary for each storyline, he became fond of the characters and felt that 10 pages were not enough, and thus the full summary for Birthright extended to about 500 pages. After delivering his work, he then wrote summaries of equal length for Conquest and Revelation, driven by the need to create a high-quality story, partially to surpass his daughter's pressuring expectations, and ended up writing enough script to fill two books. While the Japanese titles for Birthright and Conquest were written in kanji, the third storyline's title was written in katakana to distinguish it from the other two. A great deal of the character traits for the royals of Hoshido and Nohr were contributed by Kibayashi. After he had <b>done</b> <b>his</b> work on the storylines, other writers took over much of the rest of the work. The main scenario writer for the Revelation storyline was Yukinori Kitajima, a writer associated with the Senran Kagura series. He and other staff from his company Synthese also wrote the support conversations for Birthright and Conquest. One of the principal writers for all three story routes was Nami Komuro, who had previously worked on Awakening.|$|E

25|$|MOVE was {{originally}} called the Christian Movement for Life {{when it was}} founded in 1972. Its founder, John Africa, was functionally illiterate. He dictated a document called The Guideline to Donald Glassey, a social worker from the University of Pennsylvania. Africa and his contemporary, mostly African-American followers wore their hair in dreadlocks, as popularized by some Caribbean musicians. They advocated a radical form of green politics and a return to a hunter-gatherer society, while stating their opposition to science, medicine, and technology.

25|$|In early 1045, Henry entered Lorraine {{with a local}} {{army and}} besieged and took Godfrey's castle of Bockelheim (near Kreuznach). He took a few other castles as well, but famine drove him out. Leaving behind enough men to guard the {{countryside}} against Godfrey's raids, he turned to Burgundy. Godfrey had <b>done</b> <b>his</b> best to foment rebellion there by creating conflicts between the imperialist faction, which supported union with the empire, and the nationalist faction, which supported an independent Burgundy. However, Louis, Count of Montbéliard, defeated Reginald I, Count of Burgundy (which was to become the Free County), and when Henry arrived, the latter was ready with Gerald, Count of Geneva, to do homage. Burgundy was thereafter united to Henry's crown.|$|E

From there, he marched at leisure to Newbury. He had <b>done</b> <b>his</b> work thoroughly. He had demoralised the Royalist cavalry, and, above all, had carried off every horse on the countryside.
