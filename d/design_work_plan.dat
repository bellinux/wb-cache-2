40|$|This report, the {{deliverable}} for Task 4 of the NA- 243 Safeguards by <b>Design</b> <b>Work</b> <b>Plan</b> for Fiscal Year 2009, {{develops the}} {{lessons to be}} learned for the institutionalization of Safeguards By Design (SBD) from the Department of Energy (DOE) experience developing and implementing DOE-STD- 1189, Integration of Safety into the Design Process. This experience was selected for study because of the similarity of the challenges of integrating safety and safeguards into the design process. Development of DOE-STD- 1189 began in January 2006 and the standard was issued for implementation in March 2008. The process was much more time consuming than originally anticipated and might not have come to fruition had senior DOE management been less committed to its success. Potentially valuable lessons can be learned from both the content and presentation of the integration approach in DOE-STD- 1189 and from the DOE experience in developing and implementing DOE-STD- 1189. These lessons are important because the instutionalization of SBD does not yet appear to have the level of senior management commitment afforded development and implementation of DOE-STD- 1189...|$|E
40|$|The Remedial <b>Design</b> <b>Work</b> <b>Plan</b> (RDWP) for Lower East Fork Poplar Creek (EFPC) Operable Unit (OU) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This {{remedial}} action {{fits into the}} overall Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) cleanup strategy by addressing contaminated floodplain soil. The objective of this {{remedial action}} is {{to minimize the risk}} to {{human health and the environment}} from contaminated soil in the Lower EFPC floodplain pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Federal Facility Agreement (FFA) (1992). In accordance with the FFA, a remedial investigation (RI) (DOE 1994 a) and a feasibility study (DOE 1994 b) were conducted to assess contamination of the Lower EFPC and propose remediation alternatives. The remedial investigation determined that the principal contaminant is mercury, which originated from releases during Y- 12 Plant operations, primarily between 1953 and 1963. The recommended alternative by the feasibility study was to excavate and dispose of floodplain soils contaminated with mercury above the remedial goal option. Following the remedial investigation/feasibility study, and also in accordance with the FFA, a proposed plan was prepared to more fully describe the proposed remedy...|$|E
40|$|A {{dedicated}} accelerator {{research and}} development facility SINBAD (Short INnovative Bunches and Accelerators at DESY) is proposed. This multi-purpose research facility is initially aimed at promoting three major goals: (1) Short electron bunches for ultra-fast science. (2) Construction of a plasma accelerator module with useable beam quality (3) Setup of an attosecond radiation source with advanced technology. Research and development on these topics is presently ongoing at various places at DESY, as add-on experiments at operational facilities. The two research goals are intimately connected: short bunches and precise femtosecond timing are requirements for developing a plasma accelerator module with external injection or staging. The scientific case of a dedicated facility for accelerator research at DESY is discussed. Further options are mentioned, like {{the use of a}} 1 GeV beam from Linac II for FEL studies. The presently planned conversion of the DORIS accelerator and its central halls into the SINBAD facility is described. The available space will allow setting up several independent experiments with a cost-effective use of the same infrastructure(for example a central high power laser, a central timing and synchronization lab, etc.). National and international contributions and proposals can be envisaged. A preliminary, possible layout and the <b>design</b> <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> are discussed...|$|E

The {{remedial}} investigation {{determined that the}} principal contaminant is mercury, which originated from releases during Y- 12 Plant operations, primarily between 1953 and 1963. The recommended alternative, {{as stated in the}} Record of Decision (ROD) was to excavate and dispose of floodplain soils contaminated with mercury above the remedial goal option. Thereafter, a public hearing was held to review the proposed plan. Comments were incorporated. The revised selected remedy, per the ROD is to excavate and dispose of floodplain soils contaminated above the remediation goal of 400 parts per million mercury. The approved ROD with this goal will be the basis for remedial design (RD). The RD work plan (RDWP) is composed of six chapters. An introductory chapter describes the purpose and scope of the RDWP, the selected remedy as identified by the ROD; the roles and responsibilities of the RD team members, and the site background information, including site history, contaminants of concern, and site characteristics. Chapter 2 contains the design objectives, RD approach, regulatory considerations during RD, and the design criteria with assumptions. Chapter 3 presents the RD planning process to prepare this RDWP, as well as secondary RD support plans. Chapter 4 describes the scope of the RD activities in more detail and identifies what will be included in the design package.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} hybrid Petri nets into modeling for {{farm work}} flow in agricultural production. The main {{emphasis is on}} the construction of an adequate model for <b>designing</b> practical farm <b>work</b> <b>planning</b> for agriculture production corporations. Hybrid Petri nets conventionally comprise a continuous part and a discrete part.

The proposed model also models the present status or undesirable breaks during the farming process. Moreover, in this paper, the approach of formulating the farm <b>work</b> <b>planning</b> problem based on the model is suggested. The simulated results reveal that the hybrid Petri nets model is promising for exactly describing the farming process and reallocating resources in the presence of uncertainties.

2500|$|Though {{the purpose}} of Hosking's masterly {{orientation}} and design received considerable praise, there remained some for whom the completed chapel, not being adherent to strict, or 'high' gothic principles, was deemed to be of 'poor design', whilst for others it {{was said to be}} 'pretentious' since it appeared to be the first use of the gothic revival style for an unconsecrated chapel in England {{at a time when the}} style was being associated with Anglican and Anglo-Catholic ideas.

Transitions in focus were those between preschool-class and primary school, between grade three and four and the last between grade six and seven.

Those levels were officially removed when the curriculum of 1994 was introduced.
