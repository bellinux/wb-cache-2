5000|$|Perhaps any {{anticipation}} of the resulting challenge was too great at the moment. Luke's account shifts from calling them [...] "the Eleven" [...] to [...] "the Apostles" [...] ("those who are sent.")

2500|$|Luke–Acts is {{an attempt}} to answer a {{theological}} problem, namely how the Messiah promised to the Jews came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church; the answer it provides, and its central theme, is that the message of Christ was sent to the Gentiles because the Jews rejected it. This theme is introduced {{at the opening of the}} gospel of Luke, when Jesus, rejected in Nazareth, recalls that the prophets were rejected by Israel and accepted by Gentiles; at the end of the gospel he commands his disciples to preach his message to all nations, [...] "beginning from Jerusalem." [...] He repeats the command in Acts, telling them to preach [...] "in <b>Jerusalem,</b> in all <b>Judea</b> <b>and</b> <b>Samaria,</b> <b>and</b> to the end of the Earth." [...] They then proceed to do so, in the order outlined: first <b>Jerusalem,</b> then <b>Judea,</b> then Samaria, then the entire (Roman) world.|$|R
50|$|Further {{waves of}} Jewish {{immigrants}} settled in Egypt during the Ptolemaic era, especially around Alexandria. Thus, their history {{in this period}} centers almost completely on Alexandria, though daughter communities rose up {{in places like the}} present Kafr ed-Dawar, and Jews served in the administration as custodians of the river. As early as the 3rd century BCE, one can speak of a widespread diaspora of Jews in many Egyptian towns and cities. In Josephus's history, it is claimed that, after the first Ptolemy took Judea, he led some 120,000 Jewish captives to Egypt from the areas of <b>Judea,</b> <b>Jerusalem,</b> <b>Samaria,</b> <b>and</b> Mount Gerizim. With them, many other Jews, attracted by the fertile soil and Ptolemy's liberality, emigrated there of their own accord. An inscription recording a Jewish dedication of a synagogue to Ptolemy and Berenice was discovered in the 19th century near Alexandria.Josephus also claims that, soon after, these 120,000 captives were freed of their bondage by Philadelphus.|$|R
