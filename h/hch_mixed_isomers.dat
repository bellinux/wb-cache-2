The {{chain propagation}} proceeds through a living anionic type coordinated insertion mechanism. The kinetic {{features of this}} process are reported. The experimental monomer reactivity ratios indicate that ε-caprolactone and its methyl derivatives yield random copolyesters. However, the ε-caprolactone/L-lactide pair exhibits a departure from randomness with the preferred incorporation of L-lactide units. The thermal properties of the copolymers were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry.

At the same time, the crystallization of L-lactide units was observed in copolymers with high concentrations of this comonomer. Analysis of the melting point depreasion data of the copolymers indicates that the L-lactide units are almost completely rejected from the caprolactone crystals, whereas about 50 % of the ε-methyl-ε-caprolactone and δ,δ-methyl-ε-caprolactone comonomer units are incorporated into the ε-caprolactone crystals due to an obvious structural similarity.

40|$|A {{number of}} steroidal and nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} receptor-binding ligands were tested {{for their ability}} to affect the formation and internalization of gap junctions in hypophysectomized rat uterine myometrial and serosal cells. Potent estrogens, including diethyistilbestrol, estradiol benzoate (EB), estradiol- 1 7 j 3, and the weak estrogens, estriol and estrone, stimulate formation of macular and annular gap junctions in myometrium in a dose-dependent fashion when administered in daily injections over 5 days. Induction of annular gap junctions in the uterine serosal epithelium follows a similar dose-dependent pattern of estrogen stimulation but requires lower levels of hormone to initiate the response. In myometrium, differential stimulation of circular and longi-tudinal myometrial cell layers was observed, with 3 to 5 times more gap junctions detected in the circular than in the longitudinal layer. Progesterone, estriol, or estrone suppress the myometrial gap junction response to EB when administered concurrently with EB. However, the EB-stimulated appearance of myometrial cell gap junctions was blocked hen the progesterone-to-estrogen ratio exceeded 100 : 1. The estrogen receptor-binding androgens, 5 a-androstane- 3 j 3, 1 7 j 3 -diol (Adiol) and L -androstene- 3 3, 1 7 (3 -diol failed to induce myometrial gap junctions at doses up to 5 mg/day for 5 days, whereas Adiol did induce annular gap junctions in the serosal cells at the highest dosage tested.

40|$|Conjugated {{linoleic}} acid (CLA) exhibits multiple biological and molecular activities {{that have made}} it the subject of considerable nutrition-related research. Numerous studies support broad acting anti-tumor effects including anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferation, and pro-apoptosis {{in a variety of}} model systems. CLA’s ability to influence multiple tumor promoting pathways, without toxicity, may prove valuable in the chemoprevention of breast cancer. The overall objective of this dissertation research was to investigate the potential of CLA in the chemoprevention of breast cancer in a subgroup of women at risk of developing estrogen receptor (ER) negative disease. Overexpression of either the ERBB 2 oncogene or the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a common event in ER negative breast cancer. To respond to this association, the stated research objective was pursued in relevant model systems. The primary hypothesis was that CLA would downregulate the ERBB 2 receptor in vitro and inhibit mammary tumorigenesis in vivo. The t 10 c 12 CLA isomer significantly reduced ERBB 2 protein expression in the ERBB 2 overexpressing cell line SKBr 3. This was accompanied by a decrease in NFκB nuclear localization, cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX 2) -derived prostaglandin (PG) E 2 production, increased apoptosis, and inhibition of proliferation. In contrast to the in vitro data, however 1 % dietary CLA had pro-tumor effects in the PyV-mT transgenic mouse model, Mammary gland whole mounts indicated a significant loss of adipose in the CLA-treated group compared to controls that was confirmed by the downregulation of adipocyte-specific genes including PPARγ and adiponectin. CLA’s effect on the adipose was supported by decreases in fatty acid synthase at the protein and mRNA level. cDNA microarray revealed significant downregulation of cytoskeletal and adhesion-related genes in the CLA-treated group. These data suggest CLA’s combined effect on the adipose and epithelial architecture may have promoted tumor growth in this model While the large body of evidence supporting an anti-tumor effect of CLA can not be discounted, the studies herein demonstrate the complexity of its action that may not be captured in simple model systems.

40|$|Conjugated {{linoleic}} acid (CLA) is biologically active and has altered body composition in experimental animals. Dietary supplementation with synthetic CLA reduced body fat in {{mice and rats}} {{in a number of}} studies. The CLA used in previously published research contained <b>mixed</b> <b>isomers,</b> the majority of which were 9 cl 1 t-CLA and 10 t 12 c-CLA. The biologically active isomer at the time of starting the trials described in this thesis was assumed to be 9 cl 1 t-CLA, due to the prevalence of this isomer in biological tissues. The two trials in this thesis were designed to investigate the effect of dietary CLA on energy balance. In the first (refer Abstract, section 2. 1), synthetic CLA reduced body fat in male BALB/c mice in a dose response manner, over the range 0. 25 to 1. 0 % w/w CLA in the diet. High levels (1. 0 % and 2. 0 %) caused a reduction in growth. In the second (refer Abstract, section 3. 1) dietary treatments supplemented with synthetic CLA, or bovine CLA in milk fat, at levels similar to the 0. 25 % w/w synthetic CLA treatment found to be effective in reducing body fat in mice, had no effect on energy balance in female Sprague-Dawley rats. The CLA in milk fat contains approximately 86 % of the 9 cl 1 t-CLA isomer while synthetic CLA contains approximately 37 %. 9 cl 1 t-CLA and 46 % 10 t 12 c-CLA. Results from these two trials support recent evidence from research demonstrating 10 t 12 c-CLA is the biologically active isomer, in relation to energy metabolism and body composition. 9 cl 1 t-CLA is the prevalent isomer of CLA found in the human diet.

Oximes E- 5 a,b with a terminal methyl substituent on the alkene moiety furnish nitrone only under the influence of an external electrophile [PhSeBr/AgBF 4].

The novel nature of the 1 H n. m. r. signals for the methylene protons, in the PCH 2 N link of these phosphines have been investigated using two-dimensional (31 P- 1 H) (HSC) n. m. r. and variable temperature n. m. r. spectra. The X-ray crystal structure of (Cy 2 PCH 2) 2 NCHMePh reveals the bulky nature of the phosphine and the relationship between the methylene protons and phosphorus in the solid state. In Chapter 3 a variety of transition metal complexes have been prepared using aminomethylphosphines of the type (R 2 PCH 2) 2 NR' reported in Chapter 2. The preparation and characterisation of cis platinum(II), palladium(II) and nickel (II) dichloride complexes is described together with the X-ray crystal structure of cis-[PdC 12 (Ph 2 PCH 2) 2 NCH 2 CH 2 OH] which shows the phosphine in a six-membered chelate chair conformation. Cobalt(II) dichloride, and molybdenum(0) and tungsten(0) tetracarbonyl complexes of the bis-amino- methylphosphines are also prepared and characterised. Treatment of [Rh (COD) Cl] 2 with a phosphine in the presence of KPF 6 gave hydrogenation catalyst precursors of the type [Rh(COD) (R 2 PCH 2) 2 NR'] PF 6 in good yields. Treatment of the cis-Pt(II) aminomethylphosphine complexes with SnC 12 gave [PtC 1 (SnCl 3) (R 2 PCH 2) 2 NR'] complexes which displayed poor solubility. Reactions of the phosphine (Cy 2 PCH 2) 2 NCHMePh with various metal complexes have been investigated, as have some reactions of Pt(II) dichloride, diphosphine complexes.

These variable effects {{may be due}} to the different isomers present in commercial preparations of CLA, and the effects of the predominant individual isomers, 9 cis, 11 trans (9, 11) and 10 trans, 12 cis (10, 12) CLA are not clear. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of the individual CLA isomers on osteoclast formation and activity from human CD 14 + monocytes, and to determine whether any changes are accompanied by changes in cathepsin K, matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9), receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) gene expression. Osteoclasts were identified as TRAP + multinucleated cells. Osteoclast activity was quantified by the amount of TRAP in the cultured media. Results At 50 μM, 9, 11 CLA inhibited osteoclast formation by ~ 70 %, and both 9, 11 and 10, 12 CLA decreased osteoclast activity by ~ 85 – 90 %. Both isomers inhibited cathepsin K (50 μM 9, 11 by ~ 60 %; 10, 12 by ~ 50 %) and RANK (50 μM 9, 11 by ~ 85 %; 50 μM 10, 12 by ~ 65 %) expression, but had no effect on MMP- 9 or TNFα expression. Conclusion 9, 11 CLA inhibits osteoclast formation and activity from human cells, suggesting that this isomer may prevent bone resorption in humans. Although 10, 12 CLA did not significantly reduce osteoclast formation, it reduced osteoclast activity and cathepsin K and RANK expression, suggesting that this isomer may also affect bone resorption. </p...|$|R

As a result, we obtained rheological information {{for a series of}} polyimide resins as a function of temperature, time and shear rate. It is found that the processability (e. g., melt viscosity of polyimides) and ultimate product properties (e. g., Tg of polyimides) can be systematically varied by changing the variety and composition of the aromatic diamines. It has been demonstrated that the incorporation of meta- or flexible diamines improve the melt processability of polyimides significantly.

Accordingly, copolyimides from 1, 3 -phenylenediamine (m-PDA) and 3, 4 &# 8217;-oxydianiline (3, 4 &# 8217;-ODA) were obtained with higher Tg and lower melt viscosity.

Physical instability of whey protein isolate (WPI) -stabilized corn oil-in-water emulsions increased considerably after thermal processing at ≥ 70 °C in the presence of ≥ 150 mM NaCl. WPI-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions containing 25 wt% algal or menhaden oils at pH 3. 0 had good oxidative stability when pasteurized and stored at 4 °C. The addition of EDTA and <b>mixed</b> tocopherol <b>isomers</b> further increased oxidative stability. These results suggest that WPI-stabilized algal or menhaden oil-in-water emulsions at pH 3. 0 containing EDTA may be used as an ingredient delivery system to incorporate ω- 3 fatty acids into functional foods. ^ Citral/hexadecane- or limonene/hexadecane-in-water emulsions were prepared with varying interfacial properties by coating the oil droplets with WPI, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), SDS-chitosan or gum arabic (GA). Emulsifier type had little influence on the rate of citral degradation. However, WPI and SDS-chitosan were more effective at retarding the oxidation of citral degradation products and limonene in comparison to emulsions stabilized by GA. Inhibition of oxidation by the WPI or SDS-chitosan systems could be due to the ability of these emulsifiers to produce cationic emulsion droplet interfacial membranes that inhibit the interactions between dispersed lipids and continuous phase prooxidants such as iron. This research may lead to development of new strategies to improve the stability of emulsified products containing citrus oils. ...|$|R

Especially, these fatty acids consistently attenuate the outcome of primary vascular lesions (fatty streaks), or can even induce a regression of pre-established lesions. There is, paradoxically, no clear relationship between this beneficial effect and an improvement of the lipid status in blood (triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol) usually considered as a hallmark in the etiology of atherosclerosis. On the other hand, recent data obtained both in vitro and in vivo indicate {{that part of the}} beneficial effects of CLA occurs through the modulation of vascular inflammatory and oxidant stress factors (cytokines and cyclooxygenase), {{as well as from the}} expression of adhesion molecules (VCAM, ICAM) in the aorta. This regulation involves the interaction of CLA with transcription factors such as PPARs, LXR and NF-kB targeting the gene expression dowstream. In human, clinical trials are no more conclusive than the animal experiments with regards to the contribution of CLA to modulate the lipid status in blood. Nevertheless, some data highlight the pro-atherogenic role of CLA and especially of the trans 10,cis 12 -isomer, as demonstrated by the increase in the various markers of oxidative stress (isoprostanes) and inflammatory status (C-reactive protein). In conclusion, whereas there is compelling evidence that feeding <b>mixed</b> or pure <b>isomers</b> of CLA attenuates atherosclerosis initiation and progression in several experimental models, human studies are less convincing. Nevertheless, clinical trials addressing sufficient risk factors and risk markers together are still lacking to draw a definitive conclusion and to set up obvious recommandations. The use of the sole blood lipids do not seem to be appropriate for such an evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The term {{conjugated}} {{linoleic acid}} (CLA) refers {{to a range of}} geometric and positional isomers of linoleic acid. Recent research suggests a variety of potential health benefits with consumption of dietary CLA. These include a reduction in body fat deposition that has been demonstrated in a number of monogastric species including the mouse, rat, hamster and pig. This thesis describes the effects of CLA on lipid metabolism in sheep, where CLA may be useful in reducing carcass fat and improving fatty acid profile. The results are contrasted with those in the hamster, a model monogastric species, previously shown to respond to CLA. Ovine adipose tissue metabolism was studied in explants maintained in culture and incubated with a mixture of CLA isomers and individual isomers. Total lipogenesis, and the formation of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were examined. Results show no effect of CLA (<b>mixed</b> or individual <b>isomers)</b> on total lipogenesis or desaturation of fatty acids. Furthermore, there was no effect on mRNA concentration for acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) or stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase (SCD). The effect of feeding CLA (protected from rumen degradation) to sheep, on lipogenic gene expression was then investigated. While {{there was no evidence of}} a decrease in total fat deposition, there was a decrease in the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids in the tissues. As there was no effect on SCD mRNA levels, it appears likely that CLA inhibits SCD activity rather than affecting gene expression. A further feeding study was undertaken in Golden Syrian hamsters. As in the sheep, CLA feeding reduced the monounsaturated fatty acid content of the tissues but did not change the SCD mRNA concentration in adipose tissue or liver. This further supports the suggestion that CLA directly inhibits SCD activity. Unlike the sheep, there was an overall decrease, of approximately 10 %, in total carcass fat. However, paradoxically, there was an increase in adipose tissue ACC and fatty acid synthase (FAS) mRNA concentrations. Thus, suppression of lipogenic enzyme expression does not appear to be the mechanism by which CLA reduces fat deposition. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The trinuclear {{ruthenium}} cluster RuO(OAc) ₆L₃ (where L is an ancillary ligand) {{is used to}} make {{a variety}} of mixed valence compounds in which two or more clusters are joined together by an organic bridging ligand. The magnitude of electronic coupling in the mixed valance state of these compounds is quite large and the complexes reside on the Robin-Day class II/class III borderline. The large degree of coupling in these complexes gives rise to ultrafast electron transfer whose effects are observable in the infrared (IR) spectra of these complexes. Utilizing the IR properties of the complexes we are able to arrive at thermodynamic estimates of the electronic coupling parameter (H AB) for asymmetric mixed valence compounds. These asymmetric compounds give rise to <b>mixed</b> valence <b>isomers</b> and the temperature dependence of the isomer populations is used to determine deltaH and deltaS for the electron transfer event in these complexes. The large coupling in these complexes reduces the barrier to electron transfer significantly (enabling ultrafast electron transfer). This places the rate of electron transfer {{under the control of the}} nuclear dynamics of the complex and the surrounding environment. The result is that the rate of electron transfer in these mixed valence complexes shows a strong dependence on kinetic parameters of the solvent (those that describe the movement of the nuclei of the system), but not on thermodynamic parameters of the solvent (that describe more static energetic contributions of the environment). This, in turn, leads to an unexpected temperature dependence of the electron transfer rate. It is found that the electron transfer rate dramatically increases when the solvent is frozen. This results form a decoupling of the relatively slow solvent motions from the electron transfer event allowing for the faster internal vibrational motions of the mixed valence complex to control the rate of electron transfer. The effects of the large electronic coupling in these complexes also gives rise to other surprising behaviors. The extent of the electronic coupling in the mixed valence systems is known to depend on the electron donor strength of the attached ancillary ligands. It is shown that, through supramoleuclar interactions at the ancillary ligands of these mixed valence systems, the electronic coupling may be modulated. There is a significant decrease in the resonance stabilization associated with breaking of symmetry in a mixed valence system and that this energy (together with the energy gained by restoration of symmetry) can provide substantial driving force for chemical interactions. This effect is explained in terms of both the direct stabilization of the compound through electronic coupling and in terms of resonance stabilization of the unpaired electron in the mixed valence compound. This result is then extended to molecular electronics where it is shown that changes in current effected by a chemical interaction can provide a driving force for said chemical interaction. The large magnitude of electronic coupling in these mixed valence systems is also shown to be sufficient to stabilize as the ground state what would be thought of as low-lying excited states. It is shown that an electron may transfer from a cluster to the bridging ligand and that this electron transfer gives rise to an increase in electronic coupling throughout the mixed valence state. This increase in electronic coupling is found to be sufficient to stabilize the radical state of the organic bridge. The large energy difference between uncoupled (diabatic) and coupled (adiabatic) mixed valence compounds is also exploited in order to determine whether an electron entering into the mixed valence molecule enters into a diabatic or adiabatic wavefunction. The electron transfer rate from photo- generated triplet zinc tetraphenylphorpyrin to the mixed valence compounds was observed. Comparisons of the observed electron transfer rate to the diabatic and adiabatic driving force for electron transfer are made. It is concluded that the electron enters into a diabatic wavefunciton of the mixed valence compound after which the compound evolves into the adiabatic wavefunciton. The major theme throughout this thesis is the exploitation of the huge value of electronic coupling (H AB) in order to give rise to and explain some very unique and unexpected behaviors of these mixed valence complexe...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1997. Physics & Physical OceanographyBibliography: leaves 104 - 113. Since the {{introduction}} of Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption and Ionization (MALDI) in 1988 the application of MALDI mass spectrometry has become a vital research field. The method of analyte/matrix preparation plays a central role for achieving optimal performance in MALDI. [...] In {{the first part of}} this work, a new method of preparing the samples to increase contaminant tolerance is described. While the solvent composition and matrices used in the "dried droplet" method have changed since MALDI was introduced, there has been little fundamental change in this protocol. The "dried droplet" method for MALDI MS is a simple one step process, but high concentrations of nonvolatile liquid, such as glycerol, urea, DMSO and other protein stabilizers, can reduce or eliminate the intensity of protein ion signals. Instead of using the one step process, we developed a three step process. The examples presented in this part of this thesis illustrate how analyses were improved as a result of the new sample preparation procedure. The sample films produced by the new method adhere firmly to the substrate, allowing easier washing of the film compared to the dried-droplet deposits. The films were more uniform than dried-droplet deposits with respect to ion production. The presence of non-proteinaceous material at high concentrations in the solution did not seriously affect ion production from these films. [...] The basic difference between laser desorption/ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization is that the laser radiation is directly absorbed by the analyte in the former case, while the matrix dominates energy absorption and the formation of ions in the latter. In the second part of this work, the influence of matrix concentration on analyte ion yield and the mass resolution of the molecular ion signals were investigated. MALDI time-of-flight mass spectra of protein mixed at different concentrations in each of gentisic acid, trans-α-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid and sinapic acid matrices, were obtained. The results showed that the intensities of the analyte ion peaks increase gradually with an increase in concentration of matrix in solution and then decrease slightly as the matrix concentration continues to increase. The analysis of the spectra also showed that the molecular ion peaks are broadened, and the mass resolution decreases, as the matrix concentration increases. A proposed interpretation of these results is given based on two categories of matrix concentration effects: a physical effect involving energy deposition and redistribution processes, and a chemical effect involving co-crystallization of the matrix and analyte followed by photochemical ionization. [...] Poor crystallization of a MALDI sample has a negative effect on its ability to generate ions. In the last part of this work a strategy was demonstrated to alleviate this problem. Certain amounts of impurities (or additives), present in solution during crystallization, have a pronounced effect on the crystallization process, in particular on the morphology of the deposited crystals. The technique of controlling crystal growth by additives was also discussed. The crystallization of gentisic acid <b>mixed</b> with its <b>isomers</b> and other benzoic acid derivatives was then investigated. The performance of the resulting crystals in MALDI MS was evaluated. The results showed that the admixture of gentisic acid with 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid or 3 -amino- 2, 5, 6 -trifluorobenzoic acid homogenized the crystal morphology, and consequently improved the MALDI MS performance...|$|R
