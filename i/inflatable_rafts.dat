5|$|In the People's Republic of China, {{members of}} the People's Liberation Army {{assisted}} in search and rescue operations. Officials called for about 100,000 citizens in Shanghai for work in disaster control and distribution of relief aid, with some providing relief supplies to flooded areas by <b>inflatable</b> <b>rafts.</b> Within a month, Typhoons Talim and Khanun also affected the same area, further compounding the effects of Matsa. During the 38th Session of the World Meteorological Organization in Hanoi, Vietnam, the name Matsa was retired; during the next session, the name Pakhar was nominated as its replacement. It was first used in the 2012 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{solution}} to this dilemma was simple but nonetheless ingenious. Late in 1971, an Egyptian officer suggested the use of small, light, gasoline fueled pumps that could be ferried across the canal in <b>inflatable</b> <b>rafts</b> to blast through the sand barrier by hydraulic mining. The suggestion proved worthwhile, and the Egyptian Military ordered some 300 British-made pumps. Tests showed that five of these pumps could remove 1,500 cubic metres of sand in three hours. In 1972 another 150 more powerful German-made pumps were purchased. A combination of three British-made and two German-made pumps {{made it possible to}} clear a passage in two hours.|$|E
5|$|The torrential {{rainfall}} in Florida flooded about 93,000homes, affecting 214,000residents in Miami-Dade County. An incomplete damage {{survey of}} Miami-Dade County indicated the flooding destroyed 1,005houses, severely damaged 1,358, and caused minor damage to 3,443. The flood waters, which were fourft (1.2m) deep in places, stranded many in their houses, {{forcing them to}} use canoes or <b>inflatable</b> <b>rafts</b> to move to higher grounds. All schools in the Miami area were closed, and all non-essential Miami-Dade County employees were asked to stay home. Numerous flights in Miami International Airport were canceled or delayed, although the airport remained opened. The flooding, which was greatest in Sweetwater, West Miami, Hialeah, Opa-locka, and Pembroke Park, lasted {{up to a week}} in areas. The extreme flooding damaged electrical stations, leaving more than 27,000 without power. The flooding indirectly killed three people, two from drowning as a result of driving vehicles into deep water, and one when a man fell from a tall building while trying to unclog a roof drain. Property damage totaled $450million.|$|E

25|$|Coastal {{flooding}} {{caused by}} Wilma's storm surge and flooding {{from the outer}} bands was reported in many areas, particularly around Havana. More than 250 homes were heavily flooded and rescuers required scuba gear, <b>inflatable</b> <b>rafts,</b> and amphibious vehicles to reach the most severely flooded areas. Havana was also without power and wind damage was reported {{as a result of}} winds up to 85mph (140km/h). Officials in Cuba estimated total damage to be about $700million.|$|E
500|$|Following the war, {{the group}} {{returned}} to providing rescue capability in Japan. [...] As Air Rescue Service shrank {{from a peak}} of 50 squadrons in 1954, the 37th Squadron was inactivated in May 1955. [...] During 1955, the group replaced its SB-29s with Douglas SC-54 Skymasters. [...] The SC-54 carried four 40 man <b>inflatable</b> <b>rafts</b> that were safer to drop than the single wooden boat carried by the SB-29. [...] In 1957, group headquarters and the 38th Squadron were inactivated, and the 36th and 39th Squadrons were transferred to the 2d Air Rescue Group. [...] By 1961 Air Rescue Service would have only eleven squadrons assigned.|$|E
500|$|Lees Ferry is the {{principal}} starting point for whitewater rafting trips through the Grand Canyon, which are said to offer [...] "a trip backwards through time" [...] as the river cuts through progressively older strata. The majority of trips are run by commercial rafting enterprises using both paddle and motorized <b>inflatable</b> <b>rafts</b> to carry large parties of tourists (up to 24 passengers per raft) [...] on the river with most trips lasting from one week to ten days. Some trips travel {{all the way to}} Lake Mead, [...] downstream, and can last several weeks. Permits for private trips are no longer backlogged on an extensive waiting list, but instead are now based on a lottery system. All but the most experienced rapid runners are discouraged from this potentially dangerous trip.|$|E

500|$|Once Koblenz was {{captured}} in mid-March 1945, VIII Corps was assigned a 25-mile front from Koblenz upstream (southeast) to beyond Boppard and the famous landmark, the Lorelei. Patton then gave Middleton the 89th Division and 76th Division for the river crossing. Middleton chose to cross the river near the Lorelei where the river was narrow, swift, and flanked by steep terrain, eliciting another laugh from Patton. Middleton {{knew there would be}} little German resistance there, {{and he was able to}} get the entire 89th across in one night using <b>inflatable</b> <b>rafts,</b> and then put a pontoon bridge in place by early morning. The 87th initially attempted to cross at Koblenz but met too much resistance there, compelling them to move further upstream closer to Boppard, where their crossing went smoothly. [...] Within two days Middleton had all three of his divisions across the Rhine.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian navy {{assembled}} an armada of Marinefährprahm (MFP), converted civilian {{ships and}} mine layers and 74 smaller boats. German MFPs, Siebel ferries, Pionierlandungsboote, Sturmboote, large <b>inflatable</b> <b>rafts</b> and the Seeschlange (Sea Snake a portable landing bridge), were contributed by the German navy. Rommel wished to attack, having refitted the force in Libya, to forestall an Eighth Army offensive, which was agreed by Hitler and Mussolini, {{with the proviso}} that an advance would stop at Tobruk, ready for the invasion of Malta in August. After the success of [...] and the capture of Tobruk in June, the advance by the [...] kept going after the fall of Tobruk.

2500|$|Audience {{participation}} {{is a common}} element of The Aquabats' stage shows. Both the band and their onstage characters regularly interact with the crowd, including initiating mass games of beach ball volleyball or spraying them with substances like Silly String and fire extinguishers. Additionally, a few of The Aquabats' enemies are known only to be [...] "defeated" [...] by fans by being pelted with projectiles supplied by the band, usually large quantities of plastic balls. Acknowledging the younger members of their fanbase, The Aquabats often incorporate any children in the venue {{as part of their}} shows, inviting them to dance onstage with the band {{at the end of their}} sets. With parents' permission, children can also take part in onstage games and activities with the aid of the audience. The most common of these have included [...] "pool floatie races", where two selected children mount <b>inflatable</b> <b>rafts</b> or pool toys and race across the venue via crowd surfing, and assisted stage diving, in which between songs the MC Bat Commander will gently throw children into a waiting audience so they may experience their [...] "first punk rock moment".|$|E

2500|$|At 5,344 ha (13,205 acres), Milk River was {{designated}} in June 1987 as an Order-in-Council Natural Area for conservation purposes under the Wilderness Areas, Ecological Reserves, Natural Areas and Heritage Rangelands Act and is Alberta's 100th Natural Area. It {{is owned by}} the provincial government as Public Land and administered by the Cypress District Office of Alberta Tourism, Parks and Recreation. Milk River Natural Area sits on the international border with the United States with Montana to the south, and is adjacent to the Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve to the west, with Pinhorn Provincial Grazing Reserve just beyond Kennedy Coulee. Other protected areas nearby include the Onefour Heritage Rangeland, Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park, and Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park. Access to Milk River Natural Area is challenging due to its remoteness and weather conditions: local roads and trails are impassable during or after wet weather, there is little to no cell phone coverage, and permission must be obtained when crossing grazing lease areas. However, this has helped maintain the area's relatively undisturbed condition and protected it from significant human impact. Canoes, kayaks, and <b>inflatable</b> <b>rafts</b> on float trips occasionally ply the waters of the Milk River through the Natural Area. While [...] "no-trace" [...] camping is permitted, it is not encouraged, and there are no visitor facilities provided.|$|E
