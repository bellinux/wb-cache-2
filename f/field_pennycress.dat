40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>pennycress</b> (Thlaspi arvense L.) is {{a winter}} annual weed {{with a cold}} {{requirement}} for stem elongation and flowering. The relative abilities of several native gibberellins (GAs) and GA-precursors to elicit stem growth were compared. Of the eight compounds tested, gibberellin A 1, (GA 1), GA 9, and GA 20 caused stem growth in noninduced (no cold treatment) plants. No stem growth was observed in plants treated with ent-kaurene, ent-kaurenol, ent-kaurenoic acid, GA 53, or GA 8. Moreover, of the biologically active compounds, GA 9 was the most active followed closely by GA 1. In thermoinduced plants (4 -week cold treatment at 6 °C) that were continuously treated with 2 -chlorocholine chloride to reduce endogenous GA production, GA 9 was the most biologically active compound. However, the three kaurenoid GA precursors also promoted stem growth in thermoinduced plants, and were almost as active as GA 20. No such increase in activity was observed for either GA[unk] or GA 53. The results are discussed in relation to thermoinductive regulation of GA metabolism and its significance to the initiation of stem growth in <b>field</b> <b>pennycress.</b> It is proposed that thermoinduction results in increased conversion of ent-kaurenoic acid to GAs through the C- 13 desoxy pathway and that GA 9 is the endogenous mediator of thermoinduced stem growth in <b>field</b> <b>pennycress...</b>|$|E
40|$|Transpiration-use {{efficiency}} coefficient (Kc) {{describes the}} amount of biomass produced per unit transpiration at a given vapor pressure deficit. A series of greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine the Kc values of seven weed species and to measure how Kc values were affected by fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) level and plant growth stage. Experiments were conducted using a factorial design with 4 levels of water stress (0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 7, and 1. 0 FTSW) and two harvest times (first bloom and seed maturity). After plants attained a predetermined size, each plant was sealed at the base using a polyethylene bag. Pots were weighed daily and maintained the required weight by watering through an inserted syringe. Pre-bagging transpiration was back-calculated from 0 d to the first 20 d of measured daily transpiration. One set of plants was harvested at first bloom and another set was harvested at seed maturity. Kc was calculated as the ratio of total biomass to the cumulative transpiration multiplied by the average daytime vapor pressure deficit. FTSW level {{did not affect the}} Kc of henbit (vegetative growth) or shepherd’s purse. Kc values increased as FTSW levels declined for common lambsquarters, pinnate tansymustard, henbit (complete lifecycle) and <b>field</b> <b>pennycress</b> (vegetative growth). Kc values decreased as FTSW declined for dandelion, Carolina foxtail, and <b>field</b> <b>pennycress</b> (complete lifecycle) suggesting that these species were relatively sensitive to water stress. Plant growth stage did not affect Kc for pinnate tansymustard and dandelion. Kc values decreased between the first bloom and seed maturity for <b>field</b> <b>pennycress,</b> common lambsquarters, shepherd’s-purse and henbit. The decline in Kc may be attributed to high oil content in the seed of <b>field</b> <b>pennycress,</b> shepherd’s-purse and henbit, and the highprotein content of common lambsquarters. Carolina foxtail Kc values did not respond consistently to FTSW across harvest times – Kc values increased from first bloom to seed maturity at FTSW levels 0. 3 and 0. 4, but remained same at the 0. 7 FTSW level.

The increase in the concentration of sucrose in the chlorsulfuron-treated leaves, combined with the absence of an effect of chlorsulfuron on carbon dioxide fixation, suggests that the decrease in assimilate transport is not due to an effect on the synthesis of assimilates, but rather to an effect on their movement out of the leaves.

Therefore, additional sources of energy need to be developed. <b>Field</b> <b>pennycress</b> (Thlaspi, arvense L.) {{has been found to be}} an ideal source of energy because it has prolific yield and has no value as food.

Thermogravimetric and kinetic study on <b>field</b> <b>pennycress</b> provided vital information on the degradation behavior of the feedstock. A parametric study was conducted on conventional rapid pyrolysis by using the effects model. The optimum experimental condition that gave maximum liquid yield was found to be at a temperature of 500 °C and a gas flow rate of 24 l/min. The catalysts used for catalytic fast pyrolysis were HZSM- 5, a commercial catalyst, and red mud, an alumina industry waste material. The liquid products obtained from pennycress were found to have better qualities compared to a typical lignocellulosic feedstocks pyrolysis bio-oil. The bio-oil from the red mud catalyzed experiment had almost neutral pH of 6. 5 and the pH in the case of HZSM- 5 was 5. 7. In comparison to bio-oil from conventional rapid pyrolysis, HZSM- 5 and red mud reduced the viscosity of the bio-oil by 3 and 5 times, respectively. However, red mud was only found to be effective in improving the higher heating value (HHV) of the bio-oil from 33. 18 MJ/kg (dry basis) in conventional pyrolysis to 35. 7 MJ/Kg (dry basis). The HHV of HZSM- 5 catalyzed bio-oil was 33. 63 MJ/kg. The composition of non-condensable gases and the chemical makeup of the bio-oil from the two catalysts were different, suggesting that the reaction pathways could be different. HZSM- 5 had higher selectivity for aromatics whereas red mud produced longer aliphatic chains.

40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>pennycress</b> (Thlaspi arvense L.) is {{a species}} {{with a cold}} {{requirement}} for the initiation of reproductive development (thermoinduction). Work in this laboratory {{has been focused on}} elucidating the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the bolting or rapid stem elongation response that is an intricate part of reproductive development in this species. In the present paper the cellular basis for thermo-induced stem growth was determined. Evidence is presented indicating that bolting results from the production of new cells that elongate to their original length before thermoinduction. This increase in cell division occurs in the pith and cortex approximately 0. 5 to 5. 0 millimeters below the stem apex. For at least the early stages of thermo-induced stem growth, enhanced cell elongation {{does not appear to be}} a factor because average lengths of pith cells from stems of thermo-induced plants were similar or less than noninduced controls. In addition, both the amount of increase in the production of new pith cells and stem growth were positively correlated with the length of the cold treatment. Two other lines of evidence are presented corroborating previous assertions (JD Metzger [1985] Plant Physiol 78 : 8 - 13) that gibberellins mediate thermo-induced stem growth in <b>field</b> <b>pennycress.</b> First, treatment of noninduced plants with gibberellin A 3 completely mimicked the effects of a 4 -week cold treatment on mitotic activity in the pith and cortex.

Previous work in this laboratory has demonstrated that the bolting aspect (rapid stem growth) of reproductive development is mediated by gibberellins (GA). The present paper describes the selection and characterization of a mutant lacking the capacity for thermoinduced stem growth. Seeds of an inbred <b>field</b> <b>pennycress</b> line (CR 1) were treated with the chemical mutagen ethyl methane sulfonate, germinated, and allowed to produce seed. Plants derived from these seeds were screened for reduced stem growth. A mutant line, EMS- 141, in which the lack of stem growth can be fully overcome with exogenous GA 3, was selected for further analysis. Other phenotypic abnormalities exhibited by the mutant line include reduced petiole growth, slightly delayed floral initiation, and failure of flowers to develop fully. These are also reversed with exogenous GA 3. Evidence is presented indicating {{that all of the}} alterations in growth and development exhibited by EMS- 141 are conferred by a recessive mutation of a single nuclear gene. Through quantitative analysis of endogenous GA and GA precursors and a comparison of the abilities of various compounds to restore normal growth when applied to plants of EMS- 141, the physiological basis for the mutant phenotype was determined {{to be the result of}} highly reduced endogenous GA levels. Moreover, the affected site in GA biosynthesis appears to be the accumulation of ent-kaurene, probably at the level of ent-kaurene synthase. The relative abilities of exogenous GA and GA precursors to restore normal growth of petioles and stems are compared, and the results are used to make inferences on the functions of the two different pathways of GA metabolism that exist in <b>field</b> <b>pennycress...</b>|$|E

Traces of GA 8 and GA 25 were tentatively indicated by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-selected ion monitoring. Comparison of the total ion current traces indicated that GA 19 and GA 44 were most abundant, while GA 12, 15, 20, 24, 29, 53 occurred in lesser amounts. Only small amounts of GA 1, 9, 51 were present. The levels of GA 8 and GA 25 were barely detectable. Consideration of hydroxylation patterns of the ent-gibberellane ring structure indicates two families of GAs: one with a C- 13 hydroxyl group (GA 1, 8, 19, 20, 29, 44, 53) and another whose members are either nonhydroxylated (GA 9, 12, 15, 24, 25) or lack a C- 13 hydroxyl group (GA 51). This suggests that in <b>field</b> <b>pennycress</b> there are two parallel pathways for GA metabolism with an early branch point from GA 12 : an early C- 13 hydroxylation pathway, leading ultimately to GA 1 and GA 8 and a C- 13 deoxy pathway culminating {{in the formation of}} GA 9 and GA 51...|$|E

Concern regarding greenhouse gas emissions associated with land-use change and shifting land grown for food to feedstock production for fuel has encouraged the concept of intensifying current prominent cropping systems through various double cropping strategies. Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) and <b>field</b> <b>pennycress</b> (Thlaspi arvense L.) are two winter oilseed crops that could potentially {{be integrated into the}} corn (Zea mays L.) -soybean [(Glycine max (L.)

40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>pennycress</b> (Thlaspi arvense L.) is {{a winter}} annual that {{requires}} a cold treatment for the induction of stem elongation. An inbred line was selected in which no stem elongation was observed in plants grown for 6 months at 21 °C regardless of the prevailing photoperiod. Increased exposure time of plants grown initially at 21 °C to cold (2 °C) induced a greater rate of stem elongation when the plants were returned to 21 °C. Moreover, longer cold treatments resulted in a greater maximum stem height and reduced the lag period for the onset of measurable internode elongation. The optimal temperature range for thermoinduced stem growth was broad: rates of stem growth in plants maintained for 4 weeks at either 2 ° or 10 °C were virtually identical. However, a 4 -week thermoinductive treatment at 15 °C resulted in a greater lag period for the initiation of stem elongation and a decreased growth rate. The rate of cold-induced stem elongation was greater in plants subjected to long days than for plants subjected to short days following the cold treatment. Thus, photoperiod does not control the induction of stem elongation, but does regulate stem elongation in progress. Exogenous gibberellin A 3 (GA 3) was able to substitute for the cold requirement, but elicited a greater response in plants maintained under long days than short days. This indicates that photoperiod influences the plant's sensitivity to GAs. The GA biosynthesis inhibitor, 2 -chloroethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, inhibited low temperature-induced stem elongation, and this inhibition was completely reversed by exogenous GA 3. These results suggest that cold-induced stem elongation in <b>field</b> <b>pennycress</b> is mediated by some change in the endogenous GA status...|$|E
40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>pennycress</b> (Thlaspi arvense L.) is {{a winter}} annual {{crucifer}} {{with a cold}} requirement for stem elongation and flowering. In the present study, the metabolism of exogenous [2 H]-ent-kaurenoic acid (KA) and [14 C]-gibberellin A 12 -aldehyde (GA 12 -aldehyde) was compared in thermo- and noninduced plants. Thermoinduction greatly altered both quantitative and qualitative aspects of [2 H]-KA metabolism in the shoot tips. The rate of disappearance of the parent compound was much greater in thermoinduced shoot tips. Moreover, there was 47 times more endogenous KA in noninduced than in thermoinduced shoot tips as determined by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major metabolite of [2 H]-KA in thermoinduced shoot tips was a monohydroxylated derivative of KA, while in noninduced shoot tips, the glucose ester of the hydroxy KA metabolite was the main product. Gibberellin A 9 (GA 9) was the only GA in which the incorporation of deuterium was detected by GC-MS, and this was observed only in thermoinduced shoot tips. The amount of incorporation was small {{as indicated by the}} large dilution by endogenous GA 9. In contrast, thermo- and noninduced leaves metabolized exogenous [2 H]-KA into GA 20 equally well, although the amount of conversion was also limited. These results are consistent with the suggestion (JD Metzger [1990] Plant Physiol 94 : 000 - 000) that the conversion of KA in to GAs is under thermoinductive control only in the shoot tip, the site of perception for thermoinductive temperatures in <b>field</b> <b>pennycress.</b> There were essentially no differences in the qualitative or quantitative distribution of metabolites formed following the application of [14 C]-GA 12 -aldehyde to the shoot tips of thermo- or noninduced plants.

Temperate-zone agroecological systems that are currently organized for production of summer-annual crops can be diversified by integration of fallow-season and perennial crops. Integration of such crops can improve sustainability of these agroecological systems, with minimal interference with current agricultural production. Importantly, these crops can provide feedstocks {{for a wide range of}} new bio-products that are forming a new agricultural bioeconomy, potentially providing greatly increased economic incentives for diversification. However, while there are many fallow-season and perennial crops that might be used in such a “bioeconomic” strategy for diversification, most are not yet well adapted and highly-marketable. Efforts are underway to enhance adaptation and marketability of many such crops. Critically, these efforts require a strategic approach that addresses the inherent complexity of these projects. We outline a suitable approach, which we term “sustainable commercialization”: a coordinated innovation process that integrates a new crop into the agriculture of a region, while intentionally addressing economic, environmental and social sustainability challenges via multi-stakeholder governance. This approach centers on a concerted effort to coordinate and govern innovation in three critical areas: germplasm development, multifunctional agroecosystem design and management, and development of end uses, supply chains, and markets.

Winter wheat cultivars were grown with and without downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) in 1981 - 82 and the experiment was repeated in 1982 - 83 {{with the addition of}} <b>field</b> <b>pennycress</b> (Thlaspi arvense L.). ^ Significant reduction in the dry matter of both weeds occurred due to high canopy diameter and tiller number of wheat. Higher canopy diameter and tiller number cultivars probably possessed more leaf area index, occupied more land space, utilized more photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and more thoroughly shaded weeds. Continuous shading decreased photosynthetic efficiency of weeds and made them less vigorous competitors. Thus, less dry weight of weeds was observed with increasing wheat canopy diameter and tiller number. ^ The inverse linear regression of decreasing dry weight of weeds with increasing wheat canopy diameter and tiller number was significant irrespective of the weed species, location, and growing season. Experiments under heavy weed infested plots in 1982 - 83 indicated the importance of each centimeter of canopy diameter and tillers of crop in assisting with weed management. Dry weight of weeds at intercept was 1 kg m(2 ̆ 7 - 2) in each regression equation of crop parameters. Rate of decline in the dry weight of downy brome was 45 g cm(2 ̆ 7 - 1) m(2 ̆ 7 - 2) due to canopy diameter. Tillers reduced dry weight of downy brome by about 1 g tiller(2 ̆ 7 - 1) m(2 ̆ 7 - 2). ^ Choosing cultivars based solely on the relative weed competitiveness led to the identification of some low yeilding cultivars. In order to identify high yielding, weed competitive cultivars for weed infested areas, selection should be based both on grain yield and weed competition. NE 78798, SD 75284, and Vona were the high yielding, weed competitive cultivars. The widely grown Centurk 78 was not high yielding under heavy weed infested areas. Therefore, NE 78798, SD 75284, and Vona would be acceptable culivars for weed infested areas of the Central Great Plains. ...|$|E
