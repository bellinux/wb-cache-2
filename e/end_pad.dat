5000|$|Basic {{gameplay}} involves {{taking the}} perspective of an autonomous marble moving on its own from a start pad to an <b>end</b> <b>pad,</b> without falling out of bounds. Levels may contain hazards to make this more difficult. The player controls the marble spin, and therefore movement, and can also make the marble jump. There is a variety of power-ups available to the player, which are collected by touching them with the marble. Some levels must be completed within a Qualification time, to increase difficulty. Each level also has a [...] "Gold Time", an additional challenge to complete the level in a specified time-frame. Each gold time is always possible but usually involves finding hidden powerups and/or taking shortcuts. Some levels require a number of gems {{to be picked up}} before the level can be finished. There are 100 levels, categorized by difficulty: 24 Beginner, 24 Intermediate, and 52 Advanced.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMoore’s Law {{postulated}} {{that the number}} of transistors per chip would double roughly every 2 years. In parallel with the increased device density within a chip, there is an increased overall functionality. This trend can be seen in applications such as MEMS, RF circuits, where sensors, microactuators are integrated with digital and analog electronic components. This complexity leads to smaller bond pads on devices and packaging challenges. One of the requirements for the packages of image sensors and MEMS devices (such as RF- and AeroMEMS) or solar cells is the backside contact. The optical devices require an interface with environment without any restriction caused by the packages {{and on the other hand}} require a protection against the environment.

40|$|One of {{the main}} tasks in {{developing}} a technical process to manufacture castings is to organize risering at the stage of solidification, which ensures the set level on shrinkable porosity and shrinkage cavities. As known, generally, the risering zone consists of a feeder zone and a feeding butt end zone. In references the terms of final (end) effect action or an effective area of the casting edge is possible to encounter rather than the term of feeding butt end zone. The values of feeding butt end zone are used to calculate a directional solidification in the casting mould. The design procedure of a directional solidification of castings is follows. The first design section is advised to settle down at the distance equal to the zone of feeding butt end. The subsequent design sections are advisable to settle down at distances a little bit less, than the zone of feeding butt <b>end.</b> The <b>padding</b> (lap) value ought to be selected to provide the later solidification of the upper sections of casting {{with respect to the}} sections lying below. A series of special experiments on castings of the simple configuration (slabs and bars) defines a value of the feeding zone of a butt end and makes it out as the regressional dependences of the feeding butt end zone on the characteristic sizes of this or that casting. Thus, considerable material and time expenditures are demanded to define the value of the feeding butt end zone to be used further, including calculation of directional solidification of castings. The paper offers a design procedure to calculate a zone of the feeding butt end via computing simulation of solidification in a casting mould thereby sharply reducing expenditures for searching the desirable values. To reveal spaces in the casting, staggered with shrinkable porosity, the new criteria of porosity developed in BMSTU are used. The paper shows a possibility to use the effective size as a characteristic parameter of casting for dependence of the feeding butt end zone thus providing this dependence universality and a possibility to use it for making any shaped casting, but not just the castings of a simple configuration. </p...|$|R
30|$|The {{development}} of PAD is two- to fourfold {{more common among}} diabetic patients [81]. The incidence and extent of PAD correlate with the duration and severity of DM [82]. The coexistence of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and central obesity, which is common in diabetic patients, contributes to the {{development of}} PAD [83]. There is a strong association with cardiovascular morbidity [84]. PAD results in disability with serious social consequences and may require surgery. The clinical presentation of PAD typically includes intermittent claudication, which can progress to resting pain, ulceration and gangrene. The stage of intermittent claudication is characterised by pain in the legs after walking a certain distance. The characteristic symptom in critical ischaemia stage is resting pain, which leads to severe disability. Gangrene is the <b>end</b> stage of <b>PAD</b> and amputation is inevitable. Among patients with PAD, diabetic patients have worse arterial disease and poorer outcome than non-diabetic patients. The impairment of circulation frequently combined with impaired sensation due to diabetic neuropathy, commonly results in foot ulcerations. The subsequent development of infections is a major cause of morbidity in diabetics. Evaluation of diabetic foot infections often requires clinical, laboratory, microbiological and radiological assessment with bone imaging and MRI exhibiting the best sensitivity [85]. Osteomyelitis has a profound impact on the prognosis and management of these infections and the “gold standard” for its diagnosis remains the bone biopsy. Diabetic patients are five-times more likely than non-diabetic patients to undergo an amputation [82] and, moreover, diabetes {{is the leading cause of}} non-traumatic lower extremity amputations in the United States [48]. Atheromatous disease tends to affect more distal vessels such as the tibial and the peroneal arteries, producing multiple, diffuse lesions that are less straightforward to bypass or to dilate by angioplasty [83, 86, 87].|$|R

40|$|High speed {{testing of}} a brake system using two {{different}} callipers and two different discs {{on a special}} test rig with a swinging calliper head mounting shows similar results with regard to hot judder. Holographic interferometry is used {{in an attempt to}} observe the disc mode shape during judder and although the classical fringe pattern was not obtained for the disc some useful and complementary information was forthcoming. Disc run-out measurements show that the disc takes up a permanent and increasing deformation with a two-diameter mode formation. This deformation is seen to give a brake pressure fluctuation that results in judder – the pressure being detected using a pressure transducer fitted at the calliper and the mechanical judder with an accelerometer mounted on the calliper body. The two signals allow the degree of phase shift to be estimated. A “strobing” effect, resulting from the combination of speed and video recording frequency, shows two hot-spots moving with the disc. Subsequent holographic results confirm the positions with the appearance of thermal fringes “just off” the disc surface. The images also show a classical two-diameter mode order of vibration on the disc centre. The holographic recordings also indicate pressure waves being emitted from the trailing <b>end</b> of the <b>pads</b> with the mode shape of the pads confirming high amplitude bending; the existence of the pressure waves inferring the pads lose contact with the disc surface.
