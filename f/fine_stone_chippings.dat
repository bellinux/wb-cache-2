50|$|During 1998/1999 {{the site}} was subject to a serious {{conservation}} project. Much of the vegetation was stripped away, the interior walls and a large fireplace were uncovered, the blasting hut removed and {{the hole in the}} chimney filled-in. Finally, <b>stone</b> <b>chippings</b> added to prevent further vegetation growth and an informative sign about the sites history was erected.|$|R
5000|$|These granites {{are used}} as solid {{building}} stones for bridge construction, walls, door lintels and window sills, staircase steps, flags, façades, gravestones and, as cobbles and hard core, for roads. Knaupsholz granite is used as <b>stone</b> <b>chippings</b> for trails in the Harz National Park.

5000|$|The {{gauge of}} the tramroads was 3ft 4in, {{and it was}} {{constructed}} of edge rails of a plain cross-section 2 inches wide at the head and [...] inches wide at the base, and three inches deep. The wagon wheels were double flanged, straddling the rail. Cast iron sleepers maintained the gauge, and these were supported on square wooden blocks laid on <b>stone</b> <b>chippings.</b> There were no passing places on the single line tramroads: empty wagons were manhandled off the track to allow loaded wagons to pass them.|$|R

50|$|Modern cold applied liquid {{membranes}} {{have been}} durability rated by the British Board of Agreement (BBA) for 30 years. BBA approval is a benchmark {{in determining the}} suitability of a particular fiberglass roofing system. If standard fiberglass polyester resin is used such as the same resin used in boat repairs, {{then there will be}} problems with the roof being too inflexible and not able to accommodate expansion and contraction of the building. A fit-for-purpose flexible/elastomeric resin system used as a waterproofing membrane will last for many years with just occasional inspection needed. The fact that such membranes do not require <b>stone</b> <b>chippings</b> to deflect heat means there is no risk of stones blocking drains. Liquid applied membranes are also naturally resistant to moss and lichen.|$|R
50|$|The dam {{was based}} on sedimented shale and has an {{internal}} impervious core of organic clays (grass sods). During renovation work about 70 cm of the surface layer on the old downstream face was removed and replaced by layers of shale material. That {{was covered with a}} 10 cm thick layer of topsoil sown with grass seed. On the upstream side, 60 cm was removed and on a 30 cm thick layer of <b>stone</b> <b>chippings</b> a similarly thick protective layer of ballast. The dam was also raised in height by about 1 metre. After removing 90 cm of the old dam crest, a metre-wide toe wall was integrated from the subgrade (Planum). This extends as far as the cohesive earth material of the old dam core.|$|R

50|$|This {{building}} {{dates from}} around 700 BC (in the Preclassic Period) and measures 80 meters by 50 meters. A monolithic stone basin measuring 1.3 meters across and 60 cm high is found {{on top of}} the structure. A mutilated stela was deposited inside, bearing the carving of a snakes fangs and forked tongue. To the north of this were found two stone sculptures; one of a man dressed as a jaguar and the other of a man with pronounced forehead and lips holding a sceptre or staff in his right hand. A room was built at ground level against {{the west side of the}} Serpent Building. Large amounts of worked obsidian were found in the northeast corner of this building, indicating that it was probably used as a workshop. Items found include cores, <b>stone</b> <b>chippings,</b> knives, projectile points and scrapers as well as bone tools and antlers. Associated ceramic remains were used to date these finds to the Late Preclassic (350 BC - 100 AD).|$|R
60|$|Here one observes a {{difference}} underfoot from {{what has gone}} before: scraps of Roman tile and <b>stone</b> <b>chippings</b> protrude through the grass in meagre quantity, but sufficient to suggest that masonry stood on the spot. Before the eye stretches under the moonlight {{the interior of the}} fort. So open and so large is it as to be practically an upland plateau, and yet its area lies wholly within the walls of what may be designated as one building. It is a long-violated retreat; all its corner-stones, plinths, and architraves were carried away to build neighbouring villages even before mediaeval or modern history began. Many a block which once may have helped to form a bastion here rests now in broken and diminished shape as part of the chimney-corner of some shepherd's cottage within the distant horizon, and the corner-stones of this heathen altar may form the base-course of some adjoining village church.|$|R
