25|$|Ferguson made an {{approach}} for Tottenham winger Darren Anderton, but the player signed {{a new contract}} with the North London club. He then made a bid to sign Dutchman Marc Overmars from Ajax (the European Cup winners), but the player suffered a serious knee injury and was ruled out for months. Media reports suggested that United were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> approach for Juventus and Italy forward Roberto Baggio, but the player remained in his homeland and signed for Milan instead.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2010, {{the entire}} group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson {{suggested}} they book a studio and spend time writing. Along with Garbage's long time engineer and Manson's husband Billy Bush, the band, as Bush described, [...] "hung out for a couple weeks, drank some wine and played a bunch of music”. Three or four song ideas came together during this time. [...] "But we didn't go right into making-a-record mode", Erikson recalled. [...] "It took {{a bit of time}} for us to realize that we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> album." [...] Erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process, saying that it informally began with the first phone conversations among them since their hiatus, as they discussed playing together again. After convening, and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions, they then decided to move forward with the band and embark on a full-length album. The project took off in February 2011, when Manson called Vig proposing to reunite the band and try making a new record. Manson convoked the group out of an eagerness [...] "to make loud music again". [...] "I'm a loud person", she proclaimed; [...] "I love noise and aggression. I crave contact. I needed to make that connection again. I think we all did. To get something back up when there was absolutely no momentum took a Herculean effort on everybody's part. It's like pulling yourself out of mud. Even to stand back up and say 'we're going to take another swing at this' was a scary feeling, and I'm proud of us for trying. It's much easier to stay at home.” ...|$|E

And that's one of the reasons I've decided I'm just not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> endorsement in the race." [...] He added, [...] "I {{want to make sure that}} person is ready to succeed, to take what we've done and build on that." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{desire to}} keep the labouring classes in tow {{prompted}} the United Irish League to eventually give the Land and Labour Association entry to national councils in 1900. [...] The failure of the UIL and the Irish Party to either refer to the labourers in their deliberations or {{to do anything for}} them at Westminster indicated the Associations intended subservient position. It took the Mid-Cork by-election of 1901 to show that the understanding between the UIL and the ILLA was paper-thin. When {{it became clear that the}} ILLA candidate, D. D. Sheehan, was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> impact, he was accused of being an [...] "anti-Healyite" [...] and that his first allegiance was to the labourers rather than to the party, expressed the class bias of the Irish Party against the workers.|$|E

2500|$|On November 21, 2008, Rudolph, who {{had been}} {{involved}} in the documentary, gave an exclusive interview to MTV. He explained how development of the project started and who he got involved with it: [...] "I was very involved in putting [...] together, so I saw the process, It was a very interesting process. We made a deal from the very beginning — everybody sort of shook hands with the understanding that there were going to be no boundaries on this thing. We were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> open and honest film and that we weren't going to leave the good stuff on the cutting room floor." [...] Rudolph explained that For the Record is part of the game plan for reintroducing Spears back to her fans as a pop star rather than a tabloid fixture.|$|E
2500|$|Mayumi Tsuchiya of Bounce {{felt that}} [...] "Inori"'s {{place as the}} first song on Sakanaction was {{symbolic}} for the band's increased focus on dance music. She strongly praised the album's middle section, composed solely of previously unpublished songs, for their [...] "inflected grooves" [...] and the lyrical convergence of [...] "prayers meant for {{a great number of}} people" [...] and the inner self. She felt that [...] "Nantettatte Haru da" [...] was a [...] "grief disco" [...] that was the complete opposite of the band's singles, and likened [...] "Asa no Uta" [...] to John Lennon's [...] "Imagine" [...] (1971). CDJournal reviewers felt that the album positively went against listener's expectations, and noted the theme of dawn or night on many of the album's songs. They noted that the album's final song [...] "Asa no Uta" [...] blended the album's two types of song, external and internal, into one, and was a symbolic expression of the entire album's theme. They believed the guitar-based rock, dance beat and vocal choir in the song [...] "Aoi" [...] showed off a signature style of the band, praising the song's [...] "strong melody" [...] and [...] "sprinting feeling". Kazuki Namba of Rolling Stone Japan gave the album three stars out of five; feeling generally positive about the album but let down. After listening to the band's approach on the first song [...] "Inori", Namba received the impression that the band were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> album with an entirely new form, however found that the album was merely an extension of their previous music.|$|E
2500|$|Later in October, it was {{revealed}} that several other cast members had joined the project, including Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, Graham McTavish as Dwalin, Aidan Turner as Kíli, Mark Hadlow as Dori, John Callen as Óin, Stephen Hunter as Bombur and Peter Hambleton as Glóin. On the casting of Armitage, Jackson was quoted as saying, [...] "Richard {{is one of the most}} exciting and dynamic actors working on screen today and we know he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> amazing Thorin Oakenshield. We cannot wait to start this adventure with him and feel very lucky that one of the most beloved characters in Middle Earth is in such good hands." [...] McTavish was quoted on his casting, [...] "I think that I would be very lucky indeed if ever again in my career, I was offered an opportunity that was going to be so iconic in its influence and scale with regards to The Hobbit. I can't think of anything comparable." [...] Following McTavish's casting, scheduling conflicts arose while he was working on , resulting in the game's storyline being modified so that McTavish could go to New Zealand to work on the film. On the casting of Turner, Jackson stated, [...] "Aidan is a wonderfully gifted young actor who hails from Ireland. I'm sure he will bring enormous heart and humor to the role of Kíli." [...] On the casting of Hadlow, Jackson said, [...] "I have worked with Mark Hadlow on many projects he is a fantastic actor. I am thrilled to be working with [...] on these movies." [...] Hadlow also plays Bert the Stone-troll. On his casting Callen stated, [...] "I did wonder about my casting and how they had made the choice—maybe the long hair and the beard sold it, I thought. But now that has all gone. [...] Given that Óin is almost 200years old I can presume only that it was the age." [...] On being cast in the role, Hunter said, [...] "Being cast in The Hobbit is really exciting and really an honour. I auditioned for the original Lord of the Rings way back when I signed with my agent in New Zealand. When I saw the films I thought, 'Man, I so want to do The Hobbit.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Phillies were 64-70 {{and were}} 8 games behind the Second Wild Card team St. Louis Cardinals after their {{series with the}} Braves on September 2. The Phillies {{will try to make}} an {{impressive}} late run to make the Wild Card. The Phillies started the month of September by taking 2 of 3 from the Cincinnati Reds. Then, the Phillies caught fire in the wild card standings, by sweeping both the Colorado Rockies and Miami Marlins in a 3-game series to climb back up above [...]500 {{for the first time since}} June 3, partly due to strong performances by Jimmy Rollins shortly after coming back after getting benched when he did not hustle after a pop-up on August 30. Meanwhile, the teams ahead of them struggled, with the Pittsburgh Pirates losing 6 in a row and the Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers losing 6 of their last 7 games. As a result, the Phillies were just 3 games behind the Cardinals on September 12. However, just as it seemed like the Phillies were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> improbable run to the playoffs, disaster stroke in the next series against the Houston Astros. Mainly due to bad pitching performances, the Phillies lost 3 of 4 to the last-place Astros and were 4 games back after the series. This was also when the Phillies were elmimated for good from winning the division with a 6-7 loss on August 16. However, the Phillies tried to rebound. They then had their revenge on the New York Mets for the tough losses they gave the Phils this season by sweeping them. This includes a come-from-behind 3-2 when Ryan Howard hit a 2-run home run when the Phillies were down to their final out and a huge blowout 16-1 win when the Phillies scored 8 runs on the road in the first inning for the first time since 1912. Despite the sweep, the Phillies were unable to pick up any games as the Cardinals started getting hot around this time. Then in the next series against the Atlanta Braves, although they would win the first game to climb back to 3 games behind the Cardinals, they would lose the final 2 games which sunk them to 5 games behind the Cardinals and majorly damaged their playoff hopes. However, in game 2 of the series, Ryan Howard hit his 300th career home run after 1,093 games, becoming the second fastest player to hit the 300th homer. The Phillies were unable to keep their now very slim playoff chances alive by taking just 1 of 3 from the Washington Nationals. However, Darin Ruf, who recently joined the Phillies from the minor leagues, saw that his first hit was also his first home run. [...] Their playoff chances then ended for good when the Phillies loss the first game of the next series against the Marlins on September 28. The Phillies would then finish the year by winning the next 2 games against the Marlins, but would win only 1 of 3 from the Nationals. The Phillies would finish the year 81-81. Although it was impressive to recover from 14 games behind [...]500 in just half a season, this season was their first non-winning season since 2002. The Phillies already fired first base coach Sam Perlozzo, bench coach Pete Mackanin and hitting coach Greg Gross.|$|E
