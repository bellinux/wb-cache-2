40|$|Many {{challenges}} {{exist in}} the management of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). As opposed to early disease, for which level 1 evi-dence exists for the majority of treatment alternatives, there are few recognized therapeutic standards for MBC, particularly fol-lowing initial chemotherapy (1). Randomized controlled trials in MBC are usually conducted in the first-line setting and address specific questions regarding the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of individual drugs. The design of these trials is sometimes at odds with the questions clinical oncologists face in daily practice. Several international guidelines for adjuvant therapy are widely used (2 – 4), but consensus statements regarding the management of MBC are lacking (5). Acknowledging the urgent need for these initiatives, the <b>European</b> <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Oncology</b> (ESO) joined with the European Breast Cancer Conference (EBCC) to create an MBC Task Force in 2005. The task force held its first open meeting at the EBCC-...|$|E

40|$|Compared with {{treatment}} options for early-stage breast cancer, few data exist regarding the optimal use of chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The choice {{of using a}} combination of cytotoxic chemotherapies vs sequential single agents is controversial. At the 6 th European Breast Cancer Conference, the <b>European</b> <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Oncology</b> Metastatic Breast Cancer Task Force convened an open debate on the relative benefits of combination vs sequential therapy. Based on the available data, the Task Force recommends sequential monotherapy as the preferred choice in advanced disease, in the absence of rapid clinical progression, life-threatening visceral metastases, or the need for rapid symptom and/or disease control. Patient- and disease-related factors should be used to choose between combination and sequential single-agent chemotherapy for MBC.

40|$|The Prostate Cancer Programme of the <b>European</b> <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Oncology</b> {{developed}} {{the concept of}} specialised interdisciplinary and multiprofessional prostate cancer care to be formalized in Prostate Cancer Units (PCU).

A multiprofessional Task Force of internationally recognized opinion leaders, among whom representatives of scientific societies, and patient advocates gathered to set standards for quality comprehensive prostate cancer care and designate care pathways in PCUs.

40|$|A {{consensus}} meeting {{held under}} the auspices of the <b>European</b> <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Oncology</b> concluded that the use of granulocyte growth factors is definitely indicated, or acceptable given existing evidence, in the following circumstances: to alleviate congenital neutropenia; in the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells for autotransfusion; to encourage engraftment following bone marrow transplantation and in cases of failed engraftment; to support continuation of ganciclovir anti-CMV therapy in certain patients with AIDS, where the switch to foscarnet is contraindicated or where toxicity to foscarnet develops. It was also agreed that there is an overwhelming need for carefully controlled clinical trials in a wide range of indications in which growth factor use may improve outcome. In the majority of tumours, the possible benefit of dose optimisation and intensification, and therefore the role of growth factors in support of such measures has still to be defined. Extramedullary toxicities may in these instances become dose limiting. status: publishe...|$|E
