5|$|Laboratory {{breeding}} {{experiments with}} it and other Omphalotus species have revealed {{a low level of}} compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time. It is particularly poorly compatible with O.illudens, the authors of the study suggesting the separation may have been as long ago as the Late Carboniferous separation of Gondwana from Laurasia but conceding the lack of any fossil record makes it impossible to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> genus even existed at the time.|$|E
5|$|Despite the splendidly sized new {{building}} (albeit a plain one), the church declined in {{status as the}} college gradually died. It {{is possible that the}} community ceased in 1212, when the Gloucester monks were killed by the locals; we don't know whether they were replaced. Nor do we <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> clas resumed after Llywelyn the Great retook the area. Community life probably ended with the appointment of a rector by King Henry III in 1246, although this latter is not conclusive; a college might be headed by a rector, although they were usually styled provost. There have been suggestions that there were one or more chantry chapels, which could suggest the presence of more than one priest.|$|E
5|$|The column left Bulawayo heading north, and, in {{an attempt}} to {{expedite}} its progress, reorganised itself into a more compact 290-man force at Shiloh. Lobengula, meanwhile, rode north towards the Shangani in his wagon, which left obvious tracks in its wake. Following the wagon tracks, Forbes's men were soon hot on the trail, routinely finding recently abandoned Matabele camps, provisions and stragglers. Heavy rain slowed both the king and his pursuers, and led Forbes to split his force again; moving on with a flying column of 160 men, he sent the rest back with the wagons. He pushed on, and on 3 December 1893 reached the southern bank of the Shangani, from where he could clearly see Matabele hastily driving cattle behind an impi (regiment) of warriors. The presence of smouldering fires beside the native column betrayed {{the fact that they had}} just crossed. Wishing to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> king had crossed here or at another point on the river, Forbes sent Major Allan Wilson across to scout ahead with 12 men and eight officers, and told him to return by nightfall.|$|E

25|$|Many mass spectrometers work {{in either}} {{negative}} ion mode or positive ion mode. It {{is very important}} to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> observed ions are negatively or positively charged. This is often important in determining the neutral mass but it also indicates something {{about the nature of the}} molecules.|$|E
25|$|Although {{blood levels}} of some micronutrients may be low in people {{starting}} treatment for active tuberculosis, a Cochrane review of thirty-five included trials concluded that there is insufficient research to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> routine provision of free food or energy supplements improves tuberculosis treatment outcomes. However, nutritional supplementation probably improves weight gain in some settings.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the placebo group is {{to account for the}} placebo effect, that is, effects from {{treatment}} that do not depend on the treatment itself. Such factors include knowing one is receiving a treatment, attention from health care professionals, and the expectations of a treatment's effectiveness by those running the research study. Without a placebo group to compare against, {{it is not possible to}} <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> treatment itself had any effect.|$|E

25|$|The {{distinction}} between leftmost derivation and rightmost derivation {{is important because}} in most parsers {{the transformation of the}} input is defined by giving a piece of code for every grammar rule that is executed whenever the rule is applied. Therefore, it is important to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> parser determines a leftmost or a rightmost derivation because this determines the order in which the pieces of code will be executed. See for an example LL parsers and LR parsers.|$|E
25|$|British railway {{signalling}} {{is unusual}} in that it employs the direction signalling philosophy, rather than that of speed signalling; in other words, a driver is informed of which route he will take at a junction, rather than {{the speed at which}} he should travel through it. This probably stems from the early days of railways when points and signals were not interlocked, and it was therefore important for a driver to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> points had been correctly set for him or not, and has stuck ever since.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, one cannot <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> gas in all Seyfert 2 galaxies is ionized due to photoionization from a single, non-stellar {{continuum}} {{source in}} the center or due to shock-ionization from e.g. intense, nuclear starbursts. Spectropolarimetric studies reveal that only 50% of Seyfert 2s show a hidden broad-line region and thus split Seyfert 2 galaxies into two populations. The two classes of populations appear to differ by their luminosity, where the Seyfert 2s without a hidden broad-line region are generally less luminous. This suggests absence of broad-line region is connected to low Eddington ratio, and not to obscuration.|$|E

25|$|The {{predominant}} {{view is that}} Revelation {{alludes to}} the Old Testament although it is difficult among scholars {{to agree on the}} exact number of allusions or the allusions themselves. Revelation rarely quotes directly from the Old Testament, almost every verse alludes to or echoes older scriptures. Over half of the references stem from Daniel, Ezekiel, Psalms, and Isaiah, with Daniel providing the largest number in proportion to length and Ezekiel standing out as the most influential. Because these references appear as allusions rather than as quotes, it is difficult to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> author used the Hebrew or the Greek version of the Hebrew scriptures, but he was clearly often influenced by the Greek. He very frequently combines multiple references, and again the allusional style makes it impossible to be certain to what extent he did so consciously.|$|E
25|$|Criticism of Hrdy's {{hypothesis}} {{emerges from}} evidence {{which suggests that}} male primates can discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others. In one study, researchers analysed the DNA of 75 juvenile baboons to conclude who fathered them. They found that males selectively cared for their own offspring, particularly when their offspring became involved in aggressive confrontations which posed the possibility of injuries or {{a threat to their}} social standing. Evidently, if males can discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others, then there is no purpose in the female attempting to create paternity confusion during the pregnancy stage. This would be counter-intuitive, as, once the offspring is born, the males will <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> offspring is, or is not, their own. Future research will need to be conducted in this vein to investigate whether males in other species show the ability to discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others before coming to any decisive conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Parks and Recreation {{struggled}} in the Nielsen ratings throughout its entire run on NBC. The series premiere {{was seen by}} 6.77million viewers, which media outlets described as a strong opening, comparable to the average Nielsen ratings for 30 Rock, another Thursday-night show on NBC. Viewership declined almost every week {{over the rest of}} the season, culminating in a season low of 4.25million viewers for the final episode. Parks and Recreation ended the first season with an overall average rating of 5.97million viewers viewers, ranking 94th in a list of 193 network shows for the 2008–09 television season. The Office experienced similarly poor ratings during its first season and later became a success. Low viewership presented a greater challenge for Parks and Recreation because NBC now trailed CBS, ABC and Fox in the ratings, and the move of comedian Jay Leno from The Tonight Show to a variety show in NBC's 10:00pm weeknight slot left less room on the network's primetime schedule. At the end of the season, members of the cast and crew were stressed because they did not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> show would be renewed.|$|E

500|$|Bucklew and {{his unit}} were {{transferred}} to England to support the imminent invasion of Normandy. [...] In January 1944, Bucklew and another S officer, Grant Andreasen, swam ashore at night to collect sand samples from the target beach, which would be later referred to as Omaha Beach. The mission planners needed to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> sand would support heavy vehicles. On another occasion, Bucklew and Andreasen were brought within 300 yards of the beach by a kayak paddled by a British Commando. They swam {{the rest of the}} way and hid in the water to watch and time sentry patrols, before going ashore to collect more sand samples and other useful intelligence.|$|E
500|$|Is This It {{received}} widespread critical acclaim; aggregating website Metacritic {{reports a}} normalized rating of 91, based on 26critical reviews. Joe Levy of Rolling Stone {{explained that the}} record is [...] "the stuff of which legends are made", and summed it up as [...] "more joyful and intense than anything else I've heard this year". Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, described the Strokes as [...] "a great groove band", and noted that [...] "the beats implode, clashing/resolving with punky brevity and gnarly faux simplicity". In a perfect 10 review, NME reviewer John Robinson indicated that Is This It {{was one of the}} best debut LPs by a guitar band during the past 20years. In contrast, Jon Monks of Stylus commented that its shallowness prevents it from ever being called a [...] "classic". In his favorable A– review, David Browne of Entertainment Weekly conceded that he did not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Strokes would have a long-term impact, but noted that, at the time, the record [...] "just feels right, and sometimes that's enough".|$|E
