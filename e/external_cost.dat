5|$|External costs, also {{referred}} to as hidden costs, are quantifications of the environmental and climate impacts of air transport. Whilst setting a financial value on all such impacts is difficult to do precisely, figures have been produced for the most significant. In 2000 the government valued the annual cost of climate change induced by greenhouse gas emissions from UK air transport at £1.4billion, rising to £4.8billion per annum by 2030. The impact of noise was costed at around £25million per annum in 2000, and for the same year the impact on air quality was costed at between £119million and £236million per annum. Based on figures produced by the European Environment Agency the AEF has calculated a much higher total <b>external</b> <b>cost</b> for 2000 of around £6billion.|$|E

2500|$|The 2005 WHO report {{stated that}} mercury from amalgam was {{approximately}} 1% of total global mercury emissions, and that {{one-third of the}} total mercury in most sewage systems was discharged from dental offices. Other studies have shown {{this to be a}} gross exaggeration or not reflective of developed countries. With respect to pollution in the United States, a study done in 1992 showed that batteries [...] "accounted for 86 percent of discarded mercury and dental amalgam a mere 0.56 percent". Mercury is an environmental contaminant and the WHO, OSHA, and NIOSH have established specific occupational exposure limits. Mercury imposes health risks upon the surrounding population. In economics, this pollution is considered an <b>external</b> <b>cost</b> not factored into the private costs of using mercury-based products. Environmental risks from amalgam can be mitigated by amalgam separators and the ISO has issued standards regarding the proper handling and disposal of amalgam waste. It should be noted, however, that mercury is a naturally occurring element that is present throughout the environment {{and the vast majority of}} the pollution (about 99%) comes from large-scale human industrial activity (such as coal-fired electricity generation, hydroelectric dams, and mining, which increase both airborne and waterborne mercury levels). Eventually, the airborne mercury finds its way into lakes, rivers, and oceans, where it is consumed by aquatic life. Amalgam separators may dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system, but they are not mandatory in some jurisdictions. When mercury from these sources enters bodies of water, especially acidic bodies of water, it can be converted into the more toxic methylmercury.|$|E

50|$|For example, the {{manufacturing}} {{cost of a}} car (i.e., the costs of buying inputs, land tax rates for the car plant, overhead costs of running the plant and labor costs) reflects the private cost for the manufacturer (in some ways, normal profit {{can also be seen}} as a cost of production; see, e.g., Ison and Wall, 2007, p. 181). The polluted waters or polluted air also created as {{part of the process of}} producing the car is an <b>external</b> <b>cost</b> borne by those who are affected by the pollution or who value unpolluted air or water.

40|$|Society {{has to pay}} {{large amounts}} of money to {{compensate}} for the environmental damages caused by farm emissions. These <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> are not fully accounted for in product prices and internalization of these <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> into the cost price of agricultural products is expected to influence the cost prices. This study examined the influence of inclusion of <b>external</b> environmental <b>costs</b> into the cost price of agricultural products for different farming systems. Two case studies form the framework of the study; the first case involves milk production and the second regards potato farming. In both cases conventional farming is compared with environmentally friendly farming to get insight in the different impacts and the associated <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> of the different farming methods. Each case involves five different steps. Firstly the conventional and environmentally friendly farms have clearly been defined, followed by a calculation of the current cost price of the associated products (i. e. milk and potatoes). After identifying and analyzing the farm emissions, <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> have been calculated for the different farming systems making use of the reduction cost approach and associated shadow prices for emissions. The last step adds the <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> to the initial cost price of the product, with the new costs price of the agricultural products with <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> internalized as a result. The results of the study showed that in both cases prices of the agricultural products came closer after internalizing the <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> of the farming system. Whereas the difference in initial cost price of conventional and environmentally friendly milk is 9. 52 euro per 100 kilogram of milk (24. 2 %) in advantage of the conventional farm, the price difference declines to 2. 49 euro per 100 kilogram (5. 2 %) of milk after internalizing the <b>external</b> <b>costs.</b> The same picture can be drawn from the potato case study. The price difference between the two farming systems decreased from 1. 99 euro (28. 4 %) per 100 kilogram of potatoes towards 1. 51 euro (19. 7 %) per 100 kilogram. While only based on two cases, the study indicates that internalization of <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> brings cost prices of environmentally friendly and conventional farmed products closer together. The results plead for instruments that allocate the <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> of agriculture to the polluter and thereby give financial incentives to farmers who focus on the environment and steer consumer behaviour towards a more environmentally friendly way. ...|$|R

If these effects depend on the spatial location of the land-use measures the conflict can be mediated through an appropriate spatial allocation of land use. An example of this conflict is the welfare-optimal allocation of wind turbines (WT) in a region in order to achieve a given energy target at least social costs. The energy target is motivated by the fact that wind power production is associated with relatively low CO 2 emissions and is currently the most efficient source of renewable energy supply. However, it is associated with social costs which comprise energy production costs as well as <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> caused by harmful impacts on humans and biodiversity.
