60|$|I {{know of no}} {{book which}} has come down to us with grander pretensions than this, and it is so impersonal and sincere that it is never {{offensive}} nor ridiculous. Compare the modes in which modern literature is advertised with the prospectus of this book, and think what a reading public it addresses, what criticism it expects. It {{seems to have been}} uttered from some eastern summit, with a sober morning prescience in the dawn of time, and you cannot read a sentence without being elevated as upon the table-land of the Ghauts. It has such a rhythm as the winds of the desert, such a tide as the Ganges, and is as superior to criticism as the Himmaleh Mountains. Its tone is of such unrelaxed fibre, that even at this late day, unworn by time, it wears the English and the Sanscrit dress indifferently; and its <b>fixed</b> <b>sentences</b> keep up their distant fires still, like the stars, by whose dissipated rays this lower world is illumined. The whole book by noble gestures and inclinations renders many words unnecessary. English sense has toiled, but Hindoo wisdom never perspired. Though the sentences open as we read them, unexpensively, and at first almost unmeaningly, as the petals of a flower, they sometimes startle us with that rare kind of wisdom which could only have been learned from the most trivial experience; but it comes to us as refined as the porcelain earth which subsides {{to the bottom of the}} ocean. They are clean and dry as fossil truths, which have been exposed to the elements for thousands of years, so impersonally and scientifically true that they are the ornament of the parlor and the cabinet. Any moral philosophy is exceedingly rare. This of Menu addresses our privacy more than most. It is a more private and familiar, and, at the same time, a more public and universal word, than is spoken in parlor or pulpit now-a-days. As our domestic fowls are said to have their original in the wild pheasant of India, so our domestic thoughts have their prototypes in the thoughts of her philosophers. We are dabbling in the very elements of our present conventional and actual life; as if it were the primeval conventicle where how to eat, and to drink, and to sleep, and maintain life with adequate dignity and sincerity, were the questions to be decided. It is later and more intimate with us even than the advice of our nearest friends. And yet it is true for the widest horizon, and read out of doors has relation to the dim mountain line, and is native and aboriginal there. Most books belong to the house and street only, and in the fields their leaves feel very thin. They are bare and obvious, and have no halo nor haze about them. Nature lies far and fair behind them all. But this, as it proceeds from, so it addresses, what is deepest and most abiding in man. It belongs to the noontide of the day, the midsummer of the year, and after the snows have melted, and the waters evaporated in the spring, still its truth speaks freshly to our experience. It helps the sun to shine, and his rays fall on its page to illustrate it. It spends the mornings and the evenings, and makes such an impression on us overnight as to awaken us before dawn, and its influence lingers around us like a fragrance late into the day. It conveys a new gloss to the meadows and the depths of the wood, and its spirit, like a more subtile ether, sweeps along with the prevailing winds of a country. The very locusts and crickets of a summer day are but later or earlier glosses on the Dherma Sastra of the Hindoos, a continuation of the sacred code. As we have said, there is an orientalism in the most restless pioneer, and the farthest west is but the farthest east. While we are reading these sentences, this fair modern world seems only a reprint of the Laws of Menu with the gloss of Culluca. Tried by a New England eye, or the mere practical wisdom of modern times, they are the oracles of a race already in its dotage, but held up to the sky, which is the only impartial and incorruptible ordeal, they are of a piece with its depth and serenity, and I am assured that they will have a place and significance as long as there is a sky to test them by.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical machine translation {{system based on}} sentence types for economic news stories. Conventional English-to-Japanese machine translation (MT) systems which are rule-based approaches, are difficult to translate certain types of Associated Press (AP) wire service news stories, such as economics and sports, because these topics include many fixed expressions (such as compound words or collocations) which are difficult to be processed by conventional syntactic analysis and/or word selection methods. The proposed MT system, an economic-news stories machine translation system (ENTS), can translate economic news <b>sentences</b> with <b>fixed</b> expressions. The system consists of three processes, to handle different types of <b>sentences,</b> <b>fixed</b> type, economics-specific type and general type. This paper focuses mainly on the translation method for fixed-type sentences, which {{is a kind of}} example-based approach. In this translation method, <b>fixed</b> <b>sentence</b> translation (STRA) data plays a key role. The STRA data is a set of bilingual templates, which is built automatically from <b>fixed</b> English <b>sentences</b> and their Japanese translation equivalents. The <b>fixed</b> English <b>sentences</b> are extracted automatically from the AP corpus. A series of experiments to evaluate ENTS using eco- nomic news in the AP news stories showed the translation accuracy was about 50 % higher than with our conventional rule-based MT method...|$|R

50|$|Before the Elmira Reformatory was built, Brockway {{was already}} made the {{superintendent}} in 1876. While warden at the Elmira Reformatory in Upstate New York from 1876 to 1900, Brockway introduced {{a program of}} education, training in useful trades, physical activity, indeterminate sentences, inmate classification, and an incentive program. Brockway believed that the primary reason to have a prisoner in custody was to rehabilitate and not simply just to punish. By giving them the moral and spiritual guidance that they needed, Brockway believed {{that this was the}} key to helping them become better and useful citizens. He also used the idea of indeterminate sentence which would allow a prisoner to get parole sooner than he expected, because Brockway did not believe in <b>fixed</b> <b>sentences</b> either. His rules had two sides. One side was if a prisoner was well behaved and abided by the rules, then he would be rewarded. If a prisoner did not abide by the rules then he would be punished. These sets of rules came under scrutiny.|$|E

50|$|However, by the 1860s, {{overcrowding}} {{became the}} rule of the day, partly because of the long sentences given for violent crimes, despite increasing severity inside the prison and often cruel methods of gagging and restraining prisoners. An increasing proportion of prisoners were new immigrants. As a result of a tour of prisons in 18 states, Enoch Wines and Theodore Dwight produced a monumental report describing the flaws in the existing system and proposing remedies. Their critical finding was that not one of the state prisons in the United States was seeking the reformation of its inmates as a primary goal. They set out an agenda for reform which was endorsed by a National Congress in Cincinnati in 1870. These ideas were put into practice in the Elmira Reformatory in New York in 1876 run by Zebulon Brockway. At the core of the design was an educational program which included general subjects and vocational training for the less capable. Instead of <b>fixed</b> <b>sentences,</b> prisoners who did well could be released early.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the primary}} purpose of incarceration in prison is the {{rehabilitation}} of the prisoner, abuses resulting from sentencing criminals to definite and <b>fixed</b> <b>sentences</b> made it necessary to modify the law in some manner. In 1817 New York passed a “good time” law, empowering the “inspectors of the prison to reduce the sentence of any convict sentenced to imprisonment for not less than five years, one-fourth, upon certificate of the principal keeper and other satisfactory evidence, ‘that such prisoner has behaved well. ’” Pennsylvania tried a system as early as 1790 whereby a prisoner might be released by the judge who sentenced him if he showed signs of reformation. As a historical innovation and an ingenious philosophy which greatly influenced the American parole system, the system for preparing convicts for their return to society devised by Alexander Maconochie stands out above all others. Convicts were passed through various grades of servitude, without a definite sentence, each carrying with it an increasing degree of responsibility until that stage was reached where the prisoner could be released under supervision, or with certain restraints. By 1868 there were 24 states with good time statutes, and every state had some provision for release on good time by 1940...|$|E
