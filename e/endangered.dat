5|$|Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) {{and state}} {{wildlife}} {{agencies in the}} South contributed to the American alligator's recovery. Protection under the <b>Endangered</b> Species Act allowed the species to recuperate in many areas {{where it had been}} depleted. States began monitoring their American alligator populations to ensure that they would continue to grow. In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the <b>endangered</b> species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered. The USFWS still regulates the legal trade in American alligators and their products to protect still <b>endangered</b> crocodilians that may be passed off as American alligators during trafficking.|$|E
5|$|Conservation and {{recovery}} plans for A. brownii {{have been proposed}} by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) which administers the island of Nihoa {{as part of the}} Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. In 1996, the plant was listed by the FWS as an <b>endangered</b> species. In 2003, the FWS designated the island of Nihoa as a critical habitat for the plant and it was classified as critically <b>endangered</b> on the IUCN Red List. The plant is one of 51 <b>endangered</b> or threatened plants in the Hawaiian Islands listed under the <b>Endangered</b> Species Act.|$|E
5|$|Conservation efforts {{include both}} land and species protection. Approximately 8.95km2 (equal to 3.4% of total land area) divided among 34 {{reserves}} are protected in Puerto Rico. According to the IUCN there are 21 threatened species in Puerto Rico: 2 mammals, 8 breeding birds, 8 reptiles, and 3 amphibians. The U.S. federal government lists 5 mammals, 2 amphibians, 8 birds, and 10 reptiles under the Federal <b>Endangered</b> Species Act. The Puerto Rican government, through the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER), produces its own threatened species list which includes 18 critically <b>endangered</b> species (3 amphibians, 7 birds, 3 reptiles, 2 fish and 3 invertebrates), and 14 <b>endangered</b> species. The DNER follows the IUCN classification scheme for species' priority assignment.|$|E

5|$|Currently, common elands are not <b>endangered.</b> They are conserved by the United States <b>Endangered</b> Species Act, and {{regulated}} {{in international trade}} by the Convention on International Trade in <b>Endangered</b> Species. Using ground counts and aerial surveys, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) calculates the population density of the common eland to be between 0.05 and 1 per square kilometre with a total population estimate of 136,000. Populations are considered stable or increasing in the countries of Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Malawi and possibly Tanzania.|$|E
5|$|E. reichenbachii var. albertii (commonly {{called the}} Black Lace cactus) is a federally listed <b>endangered</b> {{species of the}} United States that is endemic to Texas. It has been listed as <b>endangered</b> since 1979. Populations of E. reichenbachii var. albertii are found near the Kleberg, Jim Wells, and Refugio {{counties}} of south Texas. Destruction of habitat, over-collecting, and livestock grazing have all contributed to its <b>endangered</b> status.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{hunting and}} habitat loss have {{severely}} impacted American alligator populations throughout their range, {{and whether the}} species would survive was in doubt.
