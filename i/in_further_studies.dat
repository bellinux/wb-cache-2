Hollenberg, {{professor of medicine}} at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that flavonols may also help vessels dilate and help keep platelets from clustering on the blood vessel walls. Flavonoids found in hot chocolate are beneficial to health mainly because they shield the walls of blood vessels from free radical damage. Flavanols are also thought to help reduce blood platelet buildup and can balance levels of compounds called eicosanoids, which may be beneficial to cardiovascular health.|$|E
25|$|At the university, Georgescu {{had made}} a closer {{acquaintance}} {{with one of his}} professors, Traian Lalescu, a renowned mathematician of the day who had taken a special interest in applying mathematical methods to economic reality by means of statistics. Lalescu was concerned with the lack of adequate data needed to analyse Romania's economic problems, so he encouraged Georgescu to pursue this new line of research <b>in</b> <b>further</b> <b>studies</b> abroad. Georgescu soon followed this piece of advice: In 1927 he went to France to study at the Institute de Statistique, Sorbonne in Paris.|$|E

In 1995, he published observations of a ring of circumstellar material around SN 1987A, which led to further study of explosion mechanisms in core-collapse supernovae. Plait's work with Grady, et al. resulted in the presentation of high-resolution images of isolated stellar objects (including AB Aurigae and HD 163296) from the Hubble Space Telescope, among the first of those recorded. These results have been used <b>in</b> <b>further</b> <b>studies</b> into the properties and structure of dim, young, moderate-size stars, called Herbig Ae/Be stars, which also confirmed results observed by Grady, et al.|$|E

500|$|In 1925, Congress {{authorized}} a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{study of}} the Columbia River. This study {{was included in the}} Rivers and Harbors Act of , which provided for studies on the navigation, power, flood control and irrigation potential of rivers. In , the Army Corps responded with the first of the [...] "308 Reports" [...] named after the 1925 House Document No. 308 (69th Congress, 1st Session). With the help of Washington's Senators, Wesley Jones and Clarence Dill, Congress ordered $600,000 <b>in</b> <b>further</b> <b>studies</b> to be carried out by the Army Corps and Federal Power Commission on the Columbia River Basin and Snake Rivers. U.S. Army Major John Butler was responsible for the upper Columbia River and Snake River and in 1932, his 1,000-page report was submitted to Congress. It recommended the Grand Coulee Dam and nine others on the river, including some in Canada. [...] The report stated that electricity sales from the Grand Coulee Dam could pay for construction costs. Reclamation—whose interest in the dam was revitalized by the report—endorsed it.|$|E

[...] Other critics have asserted that priming studies suffer from major publication bias, experimenter effect [...] and that criticism of the field is not dealt with constructively.|$|E
2500|$|In response, Kellner {{continues}} {{to examine the}} repercussions of understanding {{the effects of the}} September 11 attacks. He questions if the attacks are only able to be understood in a limited form of postmodern theory due to the level of irony. <b>In</b> <b>further</b> <b>studies,</b> he enhances the idea of semiotics in alignment with the theory. Similar to the act of September 11 and the symbols that were interpreted through this postmodern ideal, he {{continues to}} even describe this as [...] "semiotic systems" [...] that people use to make sense of their lives and the events that occur in them. Kellner's [...] that signs are necessary to understand one's culture is what he analyzes from the evidence that most cultures have used signs in place of existence. Finally, he recognizes that many theorists of postmodernism are trapped by their own cogitations. He finds strength in theorist Baudrillard and his idea of Marxism. Kellner acknowledges Marxism's end and lack of importance to his theory.|$|E

2500|$|The Greek Ministry of Finance has now {{installed}} a green roof on the Treasury in Constitution Square in Athens. [...] The so-called [...] "oikostegi" [...] (Greek – oiko, pronounced eeko, meaning building-ecological, and stegi, pronounced staygee, meaning roof-abode-shelter) was inaugurated in September, 2008. [...] Studies of the thermodynamics {{of the roof}} in September 2008 concluded that the thermal performance of the building was significantly affected by the installation. [...] <b>In</b> <b>further</b> <b>studies,</b> in August 2009, energy savings of 50% were observed for air conditioning in the floor directly below the installation. [...] The ten-floor building has a total floor space of 1.4 hectares. [...] The oikostegi covers 650m2, equalling 52% of the roof space and 8% of the total floor space. [...] Despite this, energy savings totalling €5,630 per annum were recorded, which translates to a 9% saving in air conditioning and a 4% saving in heating bills for the whole building. [...] An additional observation and conclusion {{of the study was}} that the thermodynamic performance of the oikostegi had improved as biomass was added over the 12 months {{between the first and second}} study. [...] This suggests that further improvements will be observed as the biomass increases still further. [...] The study also stated that while measurements were being made by thermal cameras, a plethora of beneficial insects were observed on the roof, such as butterflies, honey bees and ladybirds. [...] Obviously this was not the case before installation. [...] Finally, the study suggested that both the micro-climate and biodiversity of Constitution Square, in Athens, Greece had been improved by the oikostegi.|$|E
