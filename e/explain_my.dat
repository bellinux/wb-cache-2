500|$|Except {{for when}} Hagström needs a soloist, he and Thordendal rarely record together. Both play guitar and bass while composing. Haake says about his songwriting, [...] "Sometimes I'll sample guitar parts, cut them up, pitch-shift and tweak them until I've built the riffs I want, just for demoing purposes. But {{most of the}} time I'll just present the drums, and <b>explain</b> <b>my</b> ideas {{for the rest of the}} song, sing some riffs." [...] The band uses Cubase to record the tracks, and the guitars are routed through {{software}} amplifier modeling, because it allows them to change the amp settings even after the song was fully recorded.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} album, Wentz drew lyrical {{inspiration}} from rapper Lil Wayne, whom he called [...] "the best lyricist of [...]" [...] Speaking of Infinity on Highs lyrical themes, Wentz stated, [...] "On the last record, the lyrics were about 'This is where we're {{going to be}} a year from now, and this is what you're going to be saying about us.' But this time, we realized that a lot of bands should spend less time running their mouths and more time writing their songs." [...] In 2013, Wentz reflected, [...] "on a record like Infinity on High, I feel like I tried really hard to <b>explain</b> <b>my</b> perspective – and when I look back on it in hindsight I think it’s an extremely unrelatable record. Critics felt that much of the lyrics address the band's rise to fame and the pressure of maintaining a loyal fanbase. Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker commented that [...] "The only top-ten acts that talk about fame as much as Fall Out Boy does are rappers, although their take on selling records is less conflicted." [...] Cory Apar of Allmusic opined that [...] "Wentz' lyrics are oftentimes resentful, full of fame-induced angst, and really emphasize his need to drive home his position that stardom has not changed the band." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wallace {{had been}} working for Darwin, sending {{domestic}} fowl specimens from Indonesia, and a letter he had written in October reached Darwin at the spa. On 1 May Darwin replied, agreeing with Wallace's 1855 paper [...] "On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species": [...] "I can see that we have thought much alike & to a certain extent have come to similar conclusions. ... This summer will make the 20th year (!) since I opened my first-note-book, on the question how & in what way do species & varieties differ from each other.— I am now preparing my work for publication, but I find the subject so very large, that though I have written many chapters, I do not suppose I shall go to press for two years." [...] He agreed with Wallace that [...] "climatal conditions" [...] had little effect, and wrote [...] "It is really impossible to <b>explain</b> <b>my</b> views in the compass of a letter on the causes & means of variation in a state of nature; but I have slowly adopted a distinct & tangible idea.— Whether true or false others must judge".|$|E
