40|$|In this paper, we {{investigated}} how the excavation of ruins {{and the construction}} work affected the environmental radiation in the Shikata campus of Okayama University (S-campus). The environmental radiation was steady in the S-campus until 1997, but began to change since 1998, while the ruin's survey and the construction work started frequently after 1998 in the S-campus. In general, the soil and the concrete include the natural radioisotope (uranium series and thorium series, etc). When ruins are surveyed, {{it is necessary to}} move a large amount of the soil. In addition, a large amount of the concrete is used for the construction work. To measure the environmental radiation, the monitor posts were set up on the east and west sides of the building of the Radioisotope Center (RIC). We sampled the soil in the container in each place. We used the high-purity germanium detector to analyze them. The monitor posts showed the difference in the <b>in-air</b> <b>dose</b> rate in each place in the S-campus. The <b>in-air</b> <b>dose</b> rate at {{the east side of the}} RIC was higher than that at the west side. The result of analysis showed that the soil includes the (40) K at the east side. While the specific activity of the 40 K was 0. 849 Bq/g at the east side, the (40) K was hardly detected in the soil at the west side. The each soil included the 214 -lead and 214 -bismus ((214) Pb, (214) Bi), however, there was no significant difference in the specific activity of the each soil. The concrete included (40) K, whose specific activity was 0. 492 Bq/g. It was suggested that the change of the environmental radiation was attributed to radon and its daughter nuclides in the soil rather than the radiation from the concrete in the buildings...|$|E

The nominal peak {{tube voltage}} potential (kVp) and measured half-value layer (HVL) are sufficient to generate energy spectra and fluence profiles for characterizing an x-ray source in Computed Tomography (CT). We validate this method {{for the purpose}} of calculating patient and machine-specific radiation dose rapidly and accurately using a novel in-house hybrid (i. e., deterministic and stochastic) kV dose computation algorithm (kVDoseCalc). Spatial variation of the x-ray source spectrum was found by measuring HVL across the internal bow tie filter axis and using the nominal kVp settings and third-party software Spektr to generate the spectra. The beam fluence was calculated by dividing the integral product of the spectra and the in-air NIST mass-energy attenuation coefficients by <b>in-air</b> <b>dose</b> measurements along the filter axis. To ensure dose convergence while minimizing calculation time, we examined the sensitivity of kVDoseCalc to the number of photons seeded. We modeled the source of a Philips Brilliance Big Bore CT scanner for 90, 120, and 140 kVp settings. Doses measured using a Farmer-type Capintec ion chamber (0. 65 cc) placed in a cylindrical polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) phantom were compared to those computed with kVDoseCalc. The average percent difference between calculation and measurement pooled over all 12 positions in the phantom was determined to be 1. 68 %, 1. 60 % and 1. 25 % for 90, 120, and 140 kVp, respectively. The maximum percent difference between calculation and measurement was less than 3. 64 % pooled over all energies and measurement positions. Thirty-one {{out of a total of}} 36 simulation conditions were within the experimental uncertainties associated with measurement reproducibility and chamber volume effects. Our source characterization technique, which derives incident fluence and spectra from measurements of HVL across the bow tie profile, is sufficient for accurate patient and machine-specific CT dose calculations...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{establish}} the sensitive, ~ 120 μm high spatial resolution, high dynamic range Ge-doped optical fibres as thermoluminescence (TL) dosimeters for brachytherapy dose distribution. This requires investigation to accommodate sensitivity of detection, both {{for the possibility of}} short range dose deposition from beta components as well as gamma/x-mediated <b>dose.</b> <b>In-air</b> measurements are made at distances close to radionuclide sources, evaluating the fall off in dose along the transverse axis of Ba and Co radioactive sources, at distances from 2 mm up to 20 mm from their midpoints. Measurements have been compared with Monte Carlo code DOSRZnrc simulations for photon-mediated dose only, agreement being obtained to within 3 % and 1 % for the Ba and Co sources, respectively. As such, in both cases it is determined that as intended, beta dose has been filtered out by source encapsulation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Exposure {{to stray}} {{neutrons}} {{increases the risk}} of second cancer development after proton therapy. Previously reported analytical models of this exposure were difficult to configure and had not been investigated below 100 MeV proton energy. The purposes of this study were to test an analytical model of neutron equivalent dose per therapeutic absorbed dose  at 75 MeV and to improve the model by reducing the number of configuration parameters and making it continuous in proton energy from 100 to 250 MeV. To develop the analytical model, we used previously published H/D values in water from Monte Carlo simulations of a general-purpose beamline for proton energies from 100 to 250 MeV. We also configured and tested the model on <b>in-air</b> neutron equivalent <b>doses</b> measured for a 75 MeV ocular beamline. Predicted H/D values from the analytical model and Monte Carlo agreed well from 100 to 250 MeV (10 % average difference). Predicted H/D values from the analytical model also agreed well with measurements at 75 MeV (15 % average difference). The results indicate that analytical models can give fast, reliable calculations of neutron exposure after proton therapy. This ability is absent in treatment planning systems but vital to second cancer risk estimation...|$|R
40|$|An {{international}} collaboration {{was organized}} {{to undertake a}} dosimetry exchange to enable the future combination of clinical data from different centers conducting neutron capture therapy trials. As a first step (Part I) the dosimetry group from the Americas, represented by MIT, visited the clinical centers at Studsvik (Sweden), VTT Espoo (Finland), and the Nuclear Research Institute (NRI) at Rez (Czech Republic). A combined VTT/NRI group reciprocated with a visit to MIT. Each participant performed a series of dosimetry measurements under equivalent irradiation conditions using methods appropriate to their clinical protocols. This entailed <b>in-air</b> measurements and <b>dose</b> versus depth measurements in a large water phantom. Thermal neutron flux as well as fast neutron and photon absorbed dose rates were measured. Satisfactory agreement in determining absorbed dose within the experimental uncertainties was obtained between the different groups although the measurement uncertainties are large, ranging between 3 % and 30 % depending upon the dose component {{and the depth of}} measurement. To improve the precision in the specification of absorbed dose amongst the participants, the individually measured dose components were normalized to the results from a single method. Assuming a boron concentration of 15 mu g g(- 1) that is typical of concentrations realized clinically with the boron delivery compound boronophenylalanine-fructose, systematic discrepancies in the specification of the total biologically weighted dose of up to 10 % were apparent between the different groups. The results from these measurements will be used in future to normalize treatment plan calculations between the different clinical dosimetry protocols as Part II of this study.
