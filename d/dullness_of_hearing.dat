60|$|No {{reply was}} {{returned}} by his companion, since none could be given; and when Venn left, {{a few minutes}} later, Clym had passed from the <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> sorrow to the fluctuation of carking incertitude.|$|R
50|$|Carrincha - A fat {{alcoholic}} Civil War {{veteran who}} hurls knives at people between rants about the <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> civilian {{life and the}} worthlessness of medals. The majority of his sentences end in insane laughter.|$|R
50|$|She makes Cinnabar-red lacquerware using a coating method basing on Kamakura-bori {{technique}} {{which she}} calls Wagae-nuri (和賀江塗). Another of her techniques combines {{the brilliance of}} Shin-nuri (enamel) with the <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> an unpolished oxidized silver.|$|R
50|$|At {{the heart}} of the novel is a libel case: however, despite the {{potential}} <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> such a subject, the author weaves a suspenseful plot with many strands that drives the reader on in excited anticipation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{admit the}} justification," [...] said Deronda. [...] "I {{think what we}} call the <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> things is a disease in ourselves. Else how can any one find an intense {{interest}} in life? And many do." ...|$|R

50|$|Perelandra was {{published}} in 1943, one year after A Preface to Paradise Lost, and deals {{with many of the}} same issues as Milton's poem, such as the value <b>of</b> hierarchy, the <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> Satan, and the nature of unfallen sexuality.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was less}} famous than Hume and Bell, but none the less edited Erskine’s Principles and Stair’s Institutions. He was {{considered}} [...] "a suitably learned man who inspired some affection in his students despite bbbthe <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> his lecturing style".|$|R

5000|$|Placement of {{the mind}} (S. cittasthāpana, Tib. འཇོག་པ - sems ’jog-pa) occurs when the {{practitioner}} is able to place their attention on the object of meditation, but is unable to maintain that attention for very long.

60|$|It is {{remarkable}} how many odd or extraordinary {{people there are}} in England. We <b>hear</b> continual complaints <b>of</b> the stodgy <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> the English. It would be quite as just to complain of their freakish, unusual characters. Only en masse the metal is all Britannia.|$|R
25|$|The paper closes {{with the}} {{observation}} that the noted <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> Australian forests {{is due to the}} fact that the genera Eucalyptus and Acacia, both major components of the Australian vegetation, usually have stomata on both faces of their leaves, and thus lack a glossy upper face.|$|R
60|$|The {{words came}} slowly, {{and they were}} spoken with difficulty. At that last uttered, {{the sound of the}} sweet girl's voice died entirely away.

5000|$|Ajahn Brahmavamso states: [...] "Sloth and torpor {{refers to}} that {{heaviness}} <b>of</b> body and <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> mind which drag one down into disabling inertia and thick depression. ...

60|$|But {{here was}} a welcome diversion. The visitors, whoever they might prove to be, would afford relief to the {{situation}} and brighten the <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> life at the big house. So both Kenneth and Mr. Watson were with the drag at the station when the noon train drew in.|$|R

50|$|A. flavus colonies are {{commonly}} powdery masses of yellow-green spores {{on the upper}} surface and reddish-gold on the lower surface. In both grains and legumes, infection is minimized to small areas, and discoloration and <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> affected areas is often seen. Growth is rapid and colonies appear downy or powdery in texture.|$|R
60|$|A {{half hour}} later the tribe was again upon the ground, feeding as though naught had {{occurred}} to interrupt the somber <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> their lives.

6000|$|... "I am {{ashamed to}} say, sir, none that I can render very intelligible.

60|$|Mary {{tossed her}} head. She divined that the manse {{children}} were pitying {{her for her}} many stripes {{and she did not}} want pity. She wanted to be envied. She looked gaily about her. Her strange eyes, now that the <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> famine was removed from them, were brilliant. She would show these youngsters what a personage she was.|$|R
40|$|Seven cultivars {{of grain}} sorghum with various seed colors were studied for the {{presence}} of light-absorbing substances in the grain and starch. A corn sample was used for comparison. Starch was isolated from both sorghum and corn. Corn starch was bright in appearance and had a yellowish tinge. Sorghum starch from the cultivars Dorado, UANL- 1 -V- 187, and Blanco 88 was also bright in appearance and white; the seed color was pale yellow. Although Sorghum cultivar Dekalb 42 Y had a pale yellow seed color, it yielded a dull-appearing starch. Kansas local, Bajio, and Tamaulipas cultivars had reddish-brown seed color and also yielded dull-appearing starch that had a reddish tint. It appears that the presence of certain alcohol-soluble components contributes to the <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> some sorghum starches, because extraction of dull starch with methanol resulted in a brighter starch. Dehulling of the grain before starch isolation improved the appearance of starch. A simple alkali test on the grain was effective in predicting the <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> starch...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Edmonstone gladly {{made the}} {{engagement}} and Lady Eveleen {{promised to be}} quite well, and to teach the children all manner of new games, though she greatly despised the <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> English children, and had many droll stories of the stupidity of Laura's pupils, communicated to her, with perhaps a little exaggeration, by Charles, and still further embellished by herself, {{for the purpose of}} exciting Charlotte's indignation.|$|R
5000|$|The critics {{from the}} Internet site 'Scroll.in' quoted [...] "Aavishkar is indisputably Rajesh Khanna’s film. Through a fog of {{cigarette}} smoke, Amar’s fixed gaze communicates the <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> fatigue after the shattering of his inner world. When he speaks, {{his voice is}} low, and in two confrontational flashbacks with his hostile father-in-law, Khanna’s performance peaks. The superstar’s superb performance in Basu Bhattacharya’s domestic drama proves his unexplored talent at stasis." ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, others bemoaned the austere Roman culture during his papacy; Giorgio Vasari in 1567 {{spoke of a}} time when [...] "the grandeurs of this place reduced by stinginess <b>of</b> living, <b>dullness</b> <b>of</b> dress, and {{simplicity}} in so many things; Rome is fallen into much misery, and {{if it is true that}} Christ loved poverty and the City wishes to follow in his steps she will quickly become beggarly...".|$|R
5000|$|The precordium is {{naturally}} a cardiac area <b>of</b> <b>dullness.</b> During examination <b>of</b> the chest, the percussion note will therefore be dull. In fact, this area only gives a resonant percussion note in hyperinflation, emphysema or tension pneumothorax.|$|R
