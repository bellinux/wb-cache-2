In this meeting, Laffer, arguing against President Gerald Ford's tax increase, reportedly sketched the curve on a napkin to illustrate the concept. Cheney did not accept the idea immediately, but it caught the imaginations of those present. Laffer professes no recollection of this napkin, but writes: [...] "I used the so-called Laffer Curve all the time <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>classes</b> and with anyone else who would listen to me".|$|E

For five weeks I crammed, until {{simultaneous}} quadratic equations and chemical formulas fairly oozed from my ears. And then the master of the academy took me aside. He was very sorry, but he was compelled to give me back my tuition fee and to ask me to leave the school. It wasn't a matter of scholarship. I stood well <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>classes,</b> and did he graduate me into the university he was confident that in that institution I would continue to stand well. The trouble was that tongues were gossiping about my case. What! In four months accomplished two years' work! It would be a scandal, and the universities were becoming severer in their treatment of accredited prep schools. He couldn't afford such a scandal, therefore I must gracefully depart.|$|E

Two years later she transferred to the Eastman School of Music, where she studied with flutist Joseph Mariano, began studying composition, and graduated in 1959 with a Bachelor of Music in Music Theory and a Performer's Certificate in Flute.

My view that there is evidence of design in physics and cosmology (the type of design I have written about) is not out of the mainstream; a number of cosmologists and physicists hold to this view. In my opinion, the controversy surrounding my hire is artificial -- largely generated by one activist blogger who is not an astronomer. Lastly, I need to reiterate that I was denied tenure at ISU not because of poor academics on my part, but for ideological and political reasons." ...|$|E

5000|$|Because Radcliffe's faculty was Harvard's, in the college's first 50 years professors from Harvard - each under {{individual}} {{contracts with}} the Radcliffe administration - duplicated lectures, providing them first for men in the Harvard Yard and then crossing the Cambridge Common to provide the same lectures to women in the Radcliffe Yard. Of this experience Professor Elwood Byerly wrote that he [...] "always found the spirit, industry, and ability of the girls admirable—indeed, the average has been higher in my mathematics classes in the Annex than <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>classes</b> at the college. High academic achievement - compared to Harvard - came {{to be viewed as}} a Radcliffe norm. The New York Times reported with surprise in 1915 that all of the prizes offered in a playwriting competition at Harvard and Radcliffe that year were won by Radcliffe students. One of the Harvard contributions received honorable mention.

When questioned in depth about this, most teachers would probably state that they believe industrial arts experiences are useful in helping boys and girls become better informed about modern industry. Among teachers, the objective would differ somewhat in detail, but not in essence; they would contain these kinds of expressions: "Students <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>classes</b> become acquainted with the major areas of production, distribution and consumption of products and they get first-hand experiences in designing, producing, servicing and caring for products in common usage.

40|$|With {{increased}} awareness {{of the presence of}} second language writers in courses and programs across the disciplines comes increased requests for faculty development focused on second language writing. Drawing from scholarship on second language writing pedagogy and theory, as well as the author’s experience as an instructor of ESL writing and a WAC program director, this chapter presents approaches to working with faculty on issues related to L 2 writers. After discussing alliances WAC program leaders can make with other groups on campus who work with L 2 writers, this chapter presents a framework for thinking about the differences in L 2 writing when compared to writing by na-tive English speakers and approaches for working with faculty during consultations and workshops, with specific attention to shifting faculty perspectives on L 2 writing from a difference-as-deficit stance (Canaga-rajah, 2002) to a difference-accommodated stance, and ultimately, a difference-as-resource stance (Canagarajah, 2002). Throughout the chapter, specific workshop activities and materials are shared.
