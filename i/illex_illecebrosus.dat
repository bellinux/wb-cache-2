50|$|<b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus,</b> {{commonly}} known as the northern shortfin squid or Boston squid, is a species of neritic squids in the family Ommastrephidae. They are found in the northwest Atlantic Ocean, from off the coast of eastern North America to Greenland, Iceland, and west of Ireland and the United Kingdom. They are a highly migratory and short-lived species, with lifespans of less than a year. They are commercially important and are fished extensively (primarily by the United States and Canada), mostly for the Canadian and Japanese markets.|$|E
50|$|Hatchlings of Idiosepius thailandicus, {{possibly}} the smallest extant cephalopod species at maturity, have a mantle length of around 1 mm (Nabhitabhata, 1998:32). The closely related Idiosepius pygmaeus weighs only 0.00033 g upon hatching {{and increases in}} weight to 0.175 g as it reaches maturity in 50 days (Wood & O'Dor, 2000:93). Even smaller are the hatchlings of the commercially important <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus,</b> with a mass of 0.00015 g (O'Dor et al., 1986:59; Wood & O'Dor, 2000:93). Hatchlings of the giant Pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini)—one of the two largest octopus species—weigh 0.0253 g on average (Cosgrove & McDaniel, 2009:88).|$|E
50|$|Illex oxygonius, {{commonly}} known as the sharptail shortfin squid, is a species of neritic squids in the family Ommastrephidae. Of the species of the genus Illex, they have the most restricted range, being found only in the western North Atlantic Ocean; from off New Jersey, south to the Straits of Florida and into the Gulf of Mexico. They are very difficult to distinguish from Illex coindetii and <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus,</b> with which their geographic range overlaps. The most obvious difference of I. oxygnius is their sharper fin angles of 25° to 40° (hence their common name). There is also the possibility that they may be a hybrid of I. coindetii and I. illecebrosus.|$|E
40|$|The larvae and juveniles of <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> (Ommastrephidae) are {{described}} {{for the first}} time based on specimens from the western North Atlantic off Cape Hatteras northward to Georges Bank, New England. Two other larval forms of ommastrephid squids, Rhynchoteuthion larvae, are recognized and tentatively identified with Ommastrephes and Ornithoteuthis. Larvae and juveniles of Illex were captured during all 'seasons, indicating that spawning takes place over an extended period, possibly yearround, when the broad geographical range of the species is considered. Localities of capture of smallest larvae (1. 5 mm mantle length) indicate that the spawning site of <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> lies along {{the outer edge of the}} continental shelf...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for obtaining egg masses from captive {{populations of the}} ommastrephid squid <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> and for incubating them intact under controlled conditions. Survival of rhynchoteuthion larvae for 9 days after hatching is the best reported to date, though {{it has not yet}} been possible to induce feeding. Factors critical to rearing success are discussed, e. g. tank size, stocking density, turbulence, light levels and photoperiod, as well as food type and concentration...|$|E

40|$|Specimens {{and data}} suggest that larval short-finned squid, <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus,</b> may {{concentrate}} in water where density is approximately 26. 7, indicating that spawning occurs in the subsurface interface where Slope Water mixes with the Gulf Stream. Because these water masses occur year-round {{within the range of}} I. illecebrosus, spawning may be a prolonged or progressive process along the shareward edge of the Gulf Stream.

40|$|Oogenesis and the {{development}} of the reproductive organs in <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> females was studied. The sample analyses were obtained from the area between Cape Hatteras and the Grand Bank in 1966 - 1983. To investigate the oogenesis, 10 gonads were taken from the females with the mantle length of 15 - 30 cm at allmaturity stages (except spawning). Approximately 2, 000 specimens were studied to obtain knowledge of thedevelopment of the reproductive system organs during the ontogenesis.

40|$|<b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> squid {{appear to}} have a species‐typical and {{internally}} organized spatial arrangement of their groups. Squid maintained an average angle of 25 ° with respect to their nearest neighbour, and mostly had angular deviations between 5 ° and 20 °. They maintained distances to nearest, second and third neighbours in a ratio of 1 : 1. 5 : 2. The distances were strongly affected by group size (4, 20, or 38), with larger groups maintaining closer distances. Interindividual distances were not affected by two variables, day‐night and presence of a current in the large pool in which they were kept. The similarity of this organization to that of fish schools is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{market value}} of Atlantic-short-finned squid, <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> for certain {{importing}} countries is adversely affected by its greater propensity to undergo browning reaction than other available genera and species of squid. Browning reaction adversely affects the quality of certain dried and shredded squid. Canadian squid exports are, therefore, not competitive with exports of other genera and species of squid. The present study provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that a Maillard type reaction {{is responsible for the}} browning reaction in dried squid. This evidence includes the finding of the followimg precursors of Maillard browning in squid mantle: glucose, ribose, glucose- 6 -P, ribose- 5 -P and free amino acids, notably proline and taurine...|$|E
40|$|Five genera of cestode parasites {{were found}} in the short-finned squid. Representatives of three of these, Pelichnibothrium speciosum, Monticelli, Scolex polymorphus Rudolphi, and Nybelinia sp. are new host records. The other two genera are Phyllobothrium and Dinobothrium, both of which have {{previously}} been described from <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> illecebrosus. The specimens of Dinobothrium collected were identified to the species level, Dinobothrium plicitum Linton, for the first time. Contrary to conclusions drawn by other workers, the plerocercoids of Phyllobothrium sp. do not wander freely about the body of the squid in nature, but are restricted to the caecum. The wandering of plerocercoids referred to above is probably a function of rising temperature over the period between time of capture of the squid and time of examination...|$|E
40|$|The oxygen {{consumption}} of the ommastrephid squid <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> from Newfoundland waters {{was determined by the}} flowing water method and the hyponomal tube implanation method. Using statistical analysis, the total {{oxygen consumption}} per hour was found to be related to body weight, but with {{no significant difference between the}} sexes. This relationship was found to be similar to that reported for Octopus cyanea and Sepia officinalis. The rate of oxygen consumption does not show a significant relationship to body weight. [...] <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> shows no evidence of diurnal rhythm with regard to oxygen consumption under laboratory conditions. There is a significant decrease in oxygen consumption with decreasing salinity values. [...] The effect of either raising or lowering the pH of the environmental medium causes irregular responses in oxygen consumption. These are discussed in detail, showing the sequence of alteration in the consumption through different ranges of pH. All of the increases in oxygen consumption may be explained as secondary effects of either physical (chemical) stimulation, or osmotic stress due to the addition of pH-altering chemicals (NaOH and HCl) or their dissociation products. Decreases in oxygen consumption with change of pH may be due to lessened oxygen-carrying capacity of haemocyanin, the Bohr Effect, or to acute shock when nearing the lethal ranges of pH. [...] The absolute utilization of oxygen for I. illecebrosus was found not to be correlated with the body weight. The mean absolute oxygen utilization coefficient value was calculated to be 19. 53 %. No correlation was found between body weight and volume of exhalent water per unit time. The mean exhalent water volume was found to be 35. 62 litres per hour.

40|$|The {{food and}} feeding of Flemish Cap cod (Gadus morhua) in summer are {{described}} for 2 years, 1989 and 1990. The summer feeding intensity {{was high and}} the prey spectrum was narrow in both years. Hyperidea and redfish stood out in the diet of the Flemish Cap cod. <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> and polychaetes had a high annual variability. In the juvenile cod diet, invertebrates (crustaceans and polychaetes) were dominant and in the adults the most important prey were fish, mainly redfish. The Schoener overlap index was calculated to study the intraspecific diet overlap. It was noted that cod diet changed between age groups 3 - 5 and 6 - 10. Cannibalism rates showed year-to-year fluctuations. Ingestion of redfish was similar in both years and a direct relationship between cod length {{and the length of}} redfish they preyed on was noted...|$|E
40|$|Length {{measurements}} of a migrant ommastrephid squid <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> illecebrosus (Le-Sueur), in Newfoundland east coast waters indicated {{that only one}} modal class was present except in November of some years. Average lengths and weights of random samples taken monthly from May to November indicated also that growth was very rapid during this period. The majority of the population, averaging 140  mm in mantle length (54  g whole weight) in both sexes in May, reached maximum mantle lengths of 260  mm in males and 300  mm in females by October (weights of 360 and 550  g in males and females respectively). By fitting growth curves to these data, and by observations on sexual maturity, the approximate times of birth and mortality were extrapolated. Spawning and probable subsequent mortality of this squid {{was estimated to be}} at not more than 2 years and most probably at only 1 year of age...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{otoliths}} {{were collected}} from stomachs of short-fined squid (<b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus)</b> at 11 coastal Newfoundland localities over 11 years during 1980 [...] 1993. Most oltoliths were of young-of-the-year Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and they were common at all localities after July. Adult capelin (Mallotus villosus) otoliths were common {{early in the season}} at a southern locality whereas otoliths of juvenile sand lance (Ammodytes sp.) were common later in the season at the northern localities. Other fish that were relatively well represented in only a few otolith collections were Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), redfish (Sebastes sp.), and unidentified hake (Gadidae).

40|$|The {{food and}} feeding of Flemish Cap cod in summer are {{described}} {{for six years}} utilizing 3315 stomachs. The feeding intensity was high and the Fey spectrum was narrow in all years. Hyperiids and redfish stand out in the diet of Flemish Cap cod, <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> and polychaetes had a high annual variability. Invertebrates (crustaceans and polychaetes) were dominant in juvenile cod diets, while the most important prey in adult cod was fish, mainly redfish. The cannibalism rate has strong year to year fluctuations on the Flemish Cap. There is a positive relation between predator size (cod) and prey size (redfish).

This change consisted of an increase of hyperiids in the adult cod diet and a decline of Sebastes sp...|$|E
40|$|An {{empirical}} equation relating O 2 consumption (power input) {{to pressure}} production during jet-propelled {{swimming in the}} squid (<b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus)</b> is compared with hydrodynamic estimates of the pressure-flow power output also calculated from pressure data. Resulting estimates of efficiency and stress indicate that the circularly arranged obliquely striated muscles in squid mantle produce maximum tensions about half those of vertebrate cross-striated muscle, that "anaerobic" fibers contribute to aerobic swimming, and that peak pressure production requires an instantaneous power output higher than is thought possible for muscle. Radial muscles probably contribute additional energy via elastic storage in circular collagen fibers. Although higher rates of aerobic power consumption are only found in terrestrial animals at much higher temperatures, the constraint on squid performance is circulation, not ventilation. Anaerobic power consumption is also among the highest ever measured, but {{the division of labor}} between "aerobic" and "anaerobic" fibers suggests a system designed to optimize the limited capacity of the circulation...|$|E
40|$|Feeding {{strategies}} are different when adult <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> prey on large (trout) and small fish (mummichogs). Attacks on trout {{are characterized by}} (1) rotation as the squid changes from tail‐first to head‐first swimming; (2) an approach phase involving rapid acceleration towards the prey; (3) a tracking phase where the squid slowly follows the trout; (4) the capture phase. No tracking phase is present in attacks on mummichogs. These differences in feeding strategies {{can be explained by}} performance limitations of the squid jet propulsion system. Head‐first acceleration rates in Illex are low (max. = 12 m • s− 2) and maneuverability poor compared to fish. A large fish could thus out‐perform an attacking squid if forced into evasive action. The tracking phase is a type of oceanic stalking strategy designed to bring the squid into close proximity to larger fish. The behaviour is not necessary when attacking small fish due to their low swimming speeds...|$|E
40|$|Two general {{levels of}} {{productivity}} {{have been identified}} for the Subareas 3 + 4 component of the northern shortfin squid (<b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus)</b> population based on trends in nominal catches, research vessel survey relative biomass indices, and squid mean weight (Rivard et al., 1998; Hendrickson, 1999). A period of high productivity (1976 - 1981) occurred between two low productivity periods (1970 - 1975 and 1982 - 2004). During 2005, the relative biomass index from the Canadian Division 4 VWX July survey was well below the 1982 - 2004 average and the mean size of squid in the 2005 survey was smaller (69 g) than the 1982 - 2004 average (77 g). The 2005 nominal catch in Subareas 3 + 4 (559 mt) was also low relative to the 1982 - 2004 average (3 400 mt).

40|$|Specimens of the Ommastrephid squid <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> illecebrosus LeSueur were {{captured}} at two locations on the Avalon Peninsula {{of the island}} of Newfoundland, from July to October, 1966. A blood sample was obtained {{from each of the}} more than 400 specimens immediately upon capture. The blood samples were each centrifuged in the laboratory to remove cellular materials, and the plasma samples thereby obtained were stored at - 20 °C. Samples of this plasma were examined refractometrically for total protein content and subjected to electrophoretic analyses on a cellulose acetate medium. Antiserum to squid plasma was raised in a rabbit, and immuno-diffusion tests were carried out, also on cellulose acetate. The total protein values obtained ranged from 11. 30 to 14. 50 g/ 100 ml of plasma, the average being 12. 76 g/ 100 ml. The electrophoretic analyses revealed two closely associated protein components, at least one of which {{is believed to be the}} proteinaceous part of the respiratory pigment, hemocyanin.

40|$|Maps {{indicating}} the distributions of northern {{short fin squid}} (<b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus)</b> during spring (1996 - 2005) and autumn (1995 - 2005) bottom trawl surveys were prepared to determine the most appropriate survey sampling strata to use in deriving annual relative abundance and biomass indices for {{the portion of the}} stock in Subarea 3. During both the spring and autumn surveys, I. illecebrosus are distributed in only a few strata rather than across many strata. Spring surveys indicate an inshore migration from deeper waters during May to shallower waters of the Grand Banks during June. Most of the Illex catches during the autumn surveys occurred offshore in deep water, during October-mid-December, but some catches also occurred near shore during the same time period. It is expected that utilization of the proposed subsets of strata from each survey will improve the precision of the annual rel ative abundance and biomass indices of Illex. However, annual precision estimates must be computed to confi rm this expect ation. In addition, it is unknown whether the survey distribution patterns refl ect the timing of the surveys in relation to the species ’ annual migrations through the survey areas or whether they reflect Illex abundance...|$|E
40|$|Dipeptidyl {{aminopeptidase}} I (cathepsin C, E. C. 3. 14. 3. 1) {{was isolated}} from the hepatopancreas of the Atlantic short finned squid (<b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus)</b> and partially purified by the successive steps of autolysis of an acid extract, ammonium sulfate precipitation, heat treatment, ultrafiltration and affinity chromatography using p-CMB-Sepharose column. On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the enzyme gave one major and one minor band corresponding to a molecular weight of about 25 and 62 kdaltons, respectively. The identification of cathepsin C is based on (1) its ability to catalyze a transferase reaction with Gly-Phe-NH₂ and a hydrolase reaction with Gly-Phe-NA or Ser-Tyr-NA at pH optima of 7 and 6, respectively; (2) the Cl⁻ ion and sulfhydryl activation of the enzyme; (3) its inhibition by known inhibitors of cathepsin C; and (4) the apparent existence of a 25 kdaltons subunit, which forms associated complexes of 50, 100 and 200 kdaltons.

40|$|Squid (<b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus,</b> Loligo pealei) were {{cannulated}} in the vena cava and swum in a Beamish-type respirometer. Gas {{tensions and}} acid-base variables {{as well as}} octopine levels were estimated in samples of the mantle and of venous blood collected from quiescent, exercised, and recovered animals. When exhausted, both species exhibited a decrease in vena cava oxygen tensions and a slight alkalosis. With high swimming speeds prior to exhaustion in Illex a slight acidosis developed in the blood, which was linked to a severe intracellular acidosis. Generally, the drop in intracellular pH was linearly correlated with octopine accumulation in this species. Metabolic proton (and end-product) release from the mantle, however, was minimal, thus protecting arterial oxygen binding. High PCO 2 values in the mantle of both species lead {{to the conclusion that}} the vena cava values analyzed in this and all literature studies on unrestrained cephalopods may not reflect the scope of respiratory acid-base changes in venous blood. Although metabolic changes in blood acid-base status are negligible, the respiratory acidification of venous mantle blood may allow for a classical function of Bohr and Haldane effects in these animals...|$|E

Vertebrate predators {{in the northwest}} Atlantic consume a variety of prey species, but the proximate composition (PC; proportions of lipid, protein, ash and water) and energy density (ED; kJ g- 1) of prey, and their variability, are known poorly. In this study, key prey species from Newfoundland and Labrador were studied: Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, American plaice Hippoglossoides platessoides, sand lance Ammodytes dubius, Arctic cod Boreogadus saida, northern shrimp Pandalus borealis, redfish Sebastes spp., Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, squid <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> and Gonatus fabricii, capelin Mallotus villosus, Atlantic herring Clupea harengus and daubed shanny Lumpenus maculatus.

Illex sp. larvae were caught in the vicinity of the Florida Current between Cape Hatteras and central Florida (28 ° 30 'N 80 ° 00 'W). The larva from the latter area represents the most southwesterly capture that has been reported to date. Illex sp. larvae were also caught during surveys in February-March of 1981 and 1982 south of Newfoundland in the northern partof the Gulf Stream, the most easterly capture being at 40 ° 09 'N 53 ° 00 'W and northerly capture at 41 ° 00 'N 56 ° 00 'W. The larvae taken off Florida were 1. 1 - 6. 2 mm mantle length (ML) and those from the region south of Newfoundland were 2. 4 - 6. 6 mm. From the observed distribution and sizes of larvae in relation to water masses associated with the Gulf Stream System and in the light of recent observations on <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> spawning in captivity and temperatures required for embryonic development, it is considered that spawning probably occurs pelagically a in the winter months within the Gulf Stream or in the Gulf Stream-Slope Water frontal zone south of Cape Hatteras...|$|E
40|$|Ommastrephid squid of {{the genus}} Illex form an {{important}} trophic component of {{large areas of the}} Atlantic ocean, both as prey for fish, seabirds, whales and other cephalopods, and as predators themselves. Three species occupy extensive coastal and offshore distributions in the southwest (Illex argentinus), northwest (<b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus)</b> and northeast (Illex coindetti) Atlantic. As for many squid, the biology of Illex is poorly understood because direct observational methods for studying their population biology and behaviour are constrained by logistics and difficulties with traditional morphological techniques. The application of molecular genetic markers in squid has also been problematic, as allozyme (e. g. Carvalho et al. 1992) and mitochondrial (Norman et al. 1994) markers have shown insufficient variability for inferring population structure, migration and mating patterns. The need for suitable markers has become more urgent since the development in 1985 of an intensive fishery targeting I. argentinus, one of the largest (300 000 tons per annum) for any molluscan. The other two species are also the targets of fisheries. A study of another squid (Shaw 1997) showed that microsatellite DNA regions are abundant and highly polymorphic in this group, identifying their potential for population discrimination and individual identification (Shaw & Boyle 1997). We have isolated polymorphic microsatellite markers from I. argentinus, and tested their potential utility for defining population structure and variability {{in each of the three}} Illex species, and the wider application of primers to other genera within the Cephalopoda. ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} relationships between seabird prey harvests and fishenes catches. These correlations have {{for the most part}} been found at scales from 10 s to 100 s of kilometers within foraging ranges around seabird breeding colonies. In the present study, we investigated associations between the prey harvests of northern gannets Sula bassana at a large breeding colony off the northeast coast of Newfoundland and the catches of the inshore Newfoundland fishery at different spatial scales and time intervals. Significant correlations occurred between the seabirds' and the humans' catches of mackerel Scomber scombrus and short-finned squid <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> from 1977 through 1992. The relationships for squid were stronger over larger geographic areas than were those for mackerel. The associations for both squid and mackerel reflected abundance/availability around the colony, at a larger scale near the gannets' maximum foraging range (e. g. - 200 km), and for the entire Newfoundland region (1000 s of kilometers). These correlations were significant at August vs August and August vs annual time intervals. The gannets' landings of squid were also associated with fishery-independent, research survey indices of squid abundance over thousands of kilometers. The robustness of these relationships indicates that levels of pelagic prey harvest by seabirds can provide reliable indices of prey abundance within and outside reproductive seasons and foraging ranges around breeding colonies. Similar relationships are predicted between seabird and human fisheries that are directed at migratory 'warm-water' pelagic prey that move into cold and high latitude oceanographic regions...|$|E

Statolith morphology {{is similar to that}} of other species of the subfamily Ommastrephinae and is similar to the sibling species S. oulaniensis. Statolith development includes five stages resembling those of <b>Illex</b> <b>illecebrosus</b> and other ommastrephids. Statolith growth is characterized by negative allometry. Increments visible in ground sections of statoliths can be grouped into four main growth zones, differing mainly in colour and increment width. Age and growth rates of S. pteropus were calculated using increment counts. The life span of females of all size groups does not exceed 1 yr, that of males is 1 – 2 months shorter, probably due to preliminary mating. Instantaneous relative growth rage (G) of paralarvae is high (up to 16 % of body weight (BW)). G values for juveniles decline, but remain relatively high (7 – 8 % BW). Juveniles attain 100 – 110 mm ML by age 100 – 110 days. G values for adults are the lowest (1. 8 – 2 % BW), but daily growth rates reach maximum values (40 – 70 g per day in large females of 450 – 500 mm ML).

Oxygen-linked CO 2 binding was not present. Buffer values ranged between 5 and S. Smmoll^pHunit^ 1. For further analyses a pH/saturation diagram was selected to show the effect of pH on oxygen binding at constant POl in a continuous plot. The slopes of the resulting oxygen isobars (AHcyO 2 /ApH or A 5 /ApH) (where S is oxygen saturation) depend on pH. The diagram allows evaluation of both the Bohr coefficients (AlogPso/ApH) and the Hill coefficients (rtso) at specific pH values. It provides an integrated illustration {{of the importance of}} the Bohr effect and cooperativity for oxygen binding. In accordance with Wyman's linkage equation, Bohr and Haldane coefficients are found to be identical. Both are pH-independent between pH 7 and 8. The changing slopes of the oxygen isobars are likely to reflect changes in cooperativity with pH. Maximum values of n$o coincide with maximum steepness of the oxygen isobars in the physiological range of pH and PQ,- Assuming that the haemocyanin acts as a buffer for venous P^, this maximum in pH sensitivity and its decrease in the higher and lower pH ranges are discussed in the light of the maintenance of pigment function in vivo...|$|E
