Few other areas in the country are able to offer such comparatively low costs of living and doing business, including low energy costs, tax incentives and overnight distribution access to more than one-third the total population of the United States.

25|$|As of 2010, 8% of U.S. workers {{reported}} {{ever having}} {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} and 4% reported carpal tunnel syndrome in the past 12 months.

Among current carpal tunnel syndrome cases attributed to specific jobs, 24% were attributed to jobs in the manufacturing industry, a proportion 2.5 times higher than the proportion of current/recent workers employed in the manufacturing industry, suggesting that <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> industry are associated with an increased risk of work-related carpal tunnel syndrome.|$|E

2500|$|Lack of {{employment}} in India {{has caused the}} exclusion, especially of young men, from society. Despite prolonged higher education, young men are unable to find work. The government's withdrawal from public education funding {{has been instrumental in}} perpetuating youth exclusion in India. The youths' reaction has been to join informal groups of other young men who congregate on street corners or in teahouses to pass the time. These groups feel a sense of helplessness in their inability to join society in a productive manner. The poor economy and lack of <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case are the causes of exclusion among the younger generation, creating the social phenomena labeled as [...] "timepass". This exclusion affects young men's transitions to adulthood by making it difficult for men to marry, find housing and meet cultural gender norms of masculinity. There is also a gendered element to youth exclusion in India. Young women were barred from participating in the teahouse discussions and informal meetings that young males hold in order to cope with exclusion. This segregation is influenced by previously established gender roles that have been shaped by culture.|$|E
2500|$|Sheedy {{spent much}} of his first two years in office as his {{predecessors}} did—fighting large layoffs of state workers. [...] Governor George Pataki vetoed legislation improving pensions, threatened to shut down state government and furlough all non-essential workers if the legislature didn't approve his budget, attempted to close state-run health care facilities, and cut more than 5,500 state <b>jobs.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> difficult negotiating climate, Sheedy re-negotiated PEF's expiring contract in April 1995. [...] He agreed to the same financial package won by CSEA a month earlier: A four-year contract with a 3.5 percent salary increase in 1997 and 1998, and one-time bonuses in 1996 and 1997; a change in civil service definitions which would permit PEF workers to transfer more easily to other jobs and retain their salary levels; and no expiration date for the union's benefit packages. Additional job cuts occurred in 1996 and 1997, totalling 20,000 state workers. The state offered early retirement again to many employees. When the state pension fund showed a surplus, Sheedy found himself caught between two opposing factions of PEF members: Use the funds to lower pension contribution costs from current members, or give the surplus to retiree members as a cost-of-living increase.|$|E
