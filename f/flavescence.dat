50|$|Species in {{the genus}} are plant {{pathogens}} vectors. For instance, the elm yellows {{is transmitted from}} infected to healthy trees by the whitebanded elm leafhopper (Scaphoideus luteolus), whereas Scaphoideus titanus is the vector of the grapevine phytoplasma disease <b>flavescence</b> dorée.|$|E
50|$|Scaphoideus titanus, or the American grapevine {{leafhopper}}, is {{an insect}} of the leafhopper family (Cicadellidae) which feeds on various plants {{of the family}} Vitaceae. Native to North America, it was introduced by accident to Europe where {{it has become a}} pest by acting as a vector of the grapevine phytoplasma disease <b>flavescence</b> dorée.|$|E
50|$|Leafhoppers are {{regarded}} with some suspicion by plant-growers, {{both because of}} the additional load they place on plant metabolism {{and their ability to}} act as vectors for virus diseases and phytoplasma diseases such as <b>flavescence</b> dorée (FD). As of 2014 J. hyalinus is not known to be a disease vector and its potential to cause significant damage is assessed as very small.|$|E
50|$|The adults reach 4.5 - 6.5 mm of length. This {{leafhopper}} shows {{a distinctive}} mosaic-like {{pattern on the}} forewings and an orange band between the eyes. Orientus ishidae is associated with willow (Salix species), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and with many woody plants and deciduous trees. It may cause serious leaf damages to several tree species and is implicated as a vector of the phytoplasmic <b>flavescence</b> dorée (FD) disease in vineyards. Adults can be found from June to October.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flavescence</b> dorée (from French [...] "Flavescence" [...] : {{yellowing}} and [...] "dorée" [...] : golden) is {{a bacterial}} {{disease of the}} vine {{with the potential to}} threaten vineyards. The bacterial agent has recently been named Candidatus Phytoplasma vitis, and its vector is the leafhopper, Scaphoideus titanus. Infection may kill young vines and greatly reduce the productivity of old vines. It is classified as a phytoplasma disease belonging to the group generically termed grapevine yellows. Occurrences are in sporadic epidemics, and varieties vary in their sensitivity to it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flavescence</b> dorée first {{appeared}} in 1949 in the Armagnac region of south west France. Its insect vector, S. titanus, was originally native to the Eastern United States and Canada and {{is believed to have}} been introduced to Europe either during World War II or earlier with American rootstock brought in to fight off phylloxera. Spreading steadily throughout France, it had by 1987 reached the wine growing regions of Cognac, Languedoc and northern and southern Rhône, and by 1992 the Loire Valley, and Bordeaux. Variants of the disease are found in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, New York state, and Australia.|$|E
50|$|The average {{elevation}} of vineyards in Corsica is 300 m above sea levels {{where they are}} susceptible to strong winds. Vines were traditionally pruned to a goblet style, but modern viticultural practice and mechanical harvesting have encouraged more widespread use of single guyot and cordon de royat training styles. Vines are typically planted to a density average of 1,000 vines per acre (2,500 vines per hectare). The use of irrigation is prohibited in all AOC regions. Vineyards in Corsica are prone to occasional cicadelle attacks, which makes the vines susceptible to the phytoplasmic grape disease <b>Flavescence</b> dorée. Additional viticultural hazards include downy mildew and powdery mildew.|$|E
50|$|The chardonnay variety {{constitutes}} the white wines of the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC). Its bunches are relatively small, cylindrical, less dense {{than those of}} the Pinot noir, and consist of irregular, rather small, golden yellow grapes. Like the Pinot noir, from maturation of the first stage like the Pinot noir, it adapts better to the humidity {{of the end of the}} season with a better resistance against rotting unless undergoing vigorous growth. It is susceptible to mildew and the <b>flavescence</b> dorée bacterial disease. It buds just before the Pinot noir, which also makes it sensitive to spring frosts. The sugar contents of the berries can achieve high levels while retaining a significant acidity, which allows for wines to be particularly well balanced, powerful, detailed, and ropy, with lots of volume.|$|E
40|$|<b>Flavescence</b> dorée is a grapevine disease {{affecting}} European vineyards {{which has}} severe economic consequences and containing its spread is therefore {{considered as a}} major challenge for viticulture. <b>Flavescence</b> dorée is subject to mandatory pest control including removal of the infected vines and, in this context, automatic detection of <b>Flavescence</b> dorée symptomatic vines by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing could constitute a key diagnosis instrument for growers. The objective {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the feasibility of discriminating the <b>Flavescence</b> dorée symptoms in red and white cultivars from healthy vine vegetation using UAV multispectral imagery. Exhaustive ground truth data and UAV multispectral imagery (visible and near-infrared domain) have been acquired in September 2015 over four selected vineyards in Southwest France. Spectral signatures of healthy and symptomatic plants were studied with a set of 20 variables computed from the UAV images (spectral bands, vegetation indices and biophysical parameters) using univariate and multivariate classification approaches. Best results were achieved with red cultivars (both using univariate and multivariate approaches). For white cultivars, results were not satisfactory either for the univariate or the multivariate. Nevertheless, external accuracy assessment show that despite problems of <b>Flavescence</b> dorée and healthy pixel misclassification, an operational <b>Flavescence</b> dorée mapping technique using UAV-based imagery can still be proposed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Flavescence</b> dorée is {{a serious}} disease for European vine growers. Indeed, <b>Flavescence</b> dorée causes yield losses and lower grape quality. As a consequence, <b>Flavescence</b> dorée is costly and needs {{advanced}} control strategies. For instance, in 2005, 34 million Euro was given to Italian vine growers to compensate losses due to the disease. The infection by <b>Flavescence</b> dorée results from the association of a phytoplasma and the leafhopper vector, Scaphoideus titanus. Despite mandatory controls using insecticides, <b>Flavescence</b> dorée is still spreading in Europe. Here, we review the biology and ecology of S. titanus to suggest improved management techniques. The main findings are as follows. (1) The long-distance spread of S. titanus is mainly due to human activities, and all European vineyards are susceptible to be colonized. (2) S. titanus is an efficient vector because it can reach a high population level and it is specific to Vitis spp. (3) Current control and prophylaxis are insufficiently effective. (4) Variation in vector populations and vector capacities lead to differential risks of plant infection. Factors driving such population variations could be modeled to improve S. titanus control. (5) Feeding behavior is {{a key factor in}} the phytoplasma–vector relationship. (6) The infection risk is mainly limited by vector control. To decrease pesticide use, a cross survey of the vector population and of the infected stocks triggers mandatory treatments. (7) Alternative sustainable methods or strategies are required to reduce insecticide use and increase control efficiency. In the short term, new models could support the establishment of more sustainable pest management operations. In the long term, innovative techniques involving symbionts, mating disruption and a push–pull strategy could improve S. titanus and <b>Flavescence</b> dorée control with less environmental impact...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, we {{compared}} hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) localisation and the activities/contents of antioxidant enzymes and metabolites in the leaf tissues of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Prosecco) plants showing different sanitary status, namely diseased by <b>Flavescence</b> doree, healthy or recovered. Polymerase chain reaction {{analysis revealed that}} the pathogen associated with <b>Flavescence</b> doree (proposed as 'Candidatus Phytoplasma vitis') was detected in the leaf tissues of symptomatic plants, but was not observed in either the healthy or recovered plants. Hydrogen peroxide accumulated in the phloem plasmalemma of recovered grapevine leaves, but was not detected in either healthy or diseased material. When compared to diseased or healthy plants, recovered plants had distinctly lower extractable levels of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase, two enzymes primarily involved in the scavenging of excess H 2 O 2 generated in different cell compartments. Among healthy, diseased and recovered leaves {{there was no significant}} difference in the amount of 2 -thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, which are assumed to reflect the extent of peroxidative breakdown of membrane lipids. Therefore, it is suggested that recovery from <b>Flavescence</b> doree disease in grapevine might be associated with a long-term, sustained and tissue-specific accumulation of H 2 O 2 in leaves, which reduces numbers or prevents further infection by <b>Flavescence</b> doree phytoplasma. Recovered grapevine plants might be able to achieve such H 2 O 2 accumulation through a selective and presumably stable downregulation of enzymatic H 2 O 2 scavengers, without altering the levels of other antioxidant systems and without incurring an increased oxidative risk...|$|E

40|$|<b>Flavescence</b> dorée (FD) of grapevine is {{a serious}} dis-ease caused by phytoplasmas. Currently {{available}} proto-cols for phytoplasma detection in grapevine are com-plex and time consuming. This work reports {{the results of a}} real-time PCR assay (TaqMan®) for detecting phy-toplasmas in grapevines affected by FD. We obtained specific detection in samples from seven FD-affected grapevines. This method gave no signal with phytoplas-mas associated with another grapevine disease (Bois noir) or with eleven reference phytoplasma strains grown in periwinkle. We propose Real-time PCR as an alternative and rapid method for the detection of phyto-plasmas in grapevine. Key words: grapevine, <b>flavescence</b> dorée, phytoplas-ma detection, real-time PCR <b>Flavescence</b> dorée (FD) {{is considered one of the}} most severe threats to viticulture in all areas where it has been reported (Boudon-Padieu, 2003). It is caused by phytoplasmas transmitted by the leafhopper Sca-phoideus titanus Ball. Crop losses and environmental impact are considerable since control is based on elimi-nation of the vector with insecticides during the grow-ing season. In addition, to limit the spread of the dis-ease, the use of healthy planting material (rootstocks, cuttings and grafted vines) is necessary. One of the main constraints in FD prevention is the lack of rapid and sensitive tools for phytoplasma detection and identifica-tion. Until now, the protocols in use for phytoplasma detection in grapevine have been based on nested PCR using primers specific for phytoplasmal 16 SrDNA ribo-somal sequences (Ahrens and Seemüller, 1992; Bianc...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the grapevine}} diseases, <b>Flavescence</b> dorée (FD) is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} greatest threats for grapevine cultivation throughout Europe. In Italy, where several major outbreaks of FD have occurred in the past, the disease is still mainly restricted to the northern regions and is under mandatory regulation. In 2011 the disease was recorded for the first time in southern Italy, in several vineyards located on the isle of Ischia (Campania). In order to determine the FD-re-lated phytoplasma infecting these grapevines, molecu-lar investigations were carried out on grapevine sam-ples collected from several FD infected vineyards. The 16 S rDNA/spacer region and the FD 9 non-ribosomal fragment (secY gene) were investigated using a PCR/ RFLP based method; a nucleotide sequence analysis of the FD 9 amplified fragments was also carried out. The RFLP profiles obtained from all the analyzed sam-ples showed the presence of FD-D phytoplasma type, on both 16 S and secY genomic regions. Sequencing of the FD 9 fragments showed a 99 % nucleotide sequence identity among the tested isolates and the various FD-D strains retrieved from the NCBI database.

40|$|Abstract Background Translational and post-translational protein {{modifications}} play a {{key role}} in the response of plants to pathogen infection. Among the latter, phosphorylation is critical in modulating protein structure, localization and interaction with other partners. In this work, we used a multiplex staining approach with 2 D gels to study quantitative changes in the proteome and phosphoproteome of <b>Flavescence</b> dorée-affected and recovered ‘Barbera’ grapevines, compared to healthy plants. Results We identified 48 proteins that differentially changed in abundance, phosphorylation, or both in response to <b>Flavescence</b> dorée phytoplasma infection. Most of them did not show any significant difference in recovered plants, which, by contrast, were characterized by changes in abundance, phosphorylation, or both for 17 proteins not detected in infected plants. Some enzymes involved in the antioxidant response that were up-regulated in infected plants, such as isocitrate dehydrogenase and glutathione S-transferase, returned to healthy-state levels in recovered plants. Others belonging to the same functional category were even down-regulated in recovered plants (oxidoreductase GLYR 1 and ascorbate peroxidase). Our proteomic approach thus agreed with previously published biochemical and RT-qPCR data which reported down-regulation of scavenging enzymes and accumulation of H 2 O 2 in recovered plants, possibly suggesting a role for this molecule in remission from infection.

40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{performed}} a pest categorisation of Grapevine <b>Flavescence</b> dorée, {{also known as}} <b>Flavescence</b> dorée phytoplasma (FDP), for the European Union (EU) territory. FDP {{has not yet been}} defined as a phytoplasma species of the genus Candidatus Phytoplasma. Routine molecular detection assays are available. FDP is transmitted by grafting and vegetative propagation material as well as by insect vectors. FDP is only reported in Europe. Within Europe it is present in Serbia, in Switzerland and in 10 out of 21 countries of the grapevine producing EU countries. Besides grapevine, FDP is also commonly found in other hosts such as Ailanthus, Alnus and Clematis. FDP is included in the annexes II/A/II and II/B of the Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. Grapevine, the main host plant, is included into annexes III, IV and V of the Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. FDP is not expected to be affected by EU ecoclimatic conditions wherever its hosts are present and has the potential to establish largely within the EU territory. The specific leafhopper vector of FDP, Scaphoideus titanus, is an invasive insect that was introduced in Europe. It is only in areas where FDP and Scaphoideus titanus are associated that the direct and indirect impacts are considered to be high: yield reduction, death of grapevine plants, costs for disease and vector management procedures. Additional insect vectors are known, but are not directly associated with FDP epidemics. A major outcome of this pest categorisation has been to emphasise the role of S. titanus. Uncertainty lies mostly in the knowledge on specific FDP strain transmissibility, susceptibility of specific grapevine varieties and distribution in alternate hosts. It is not fully known how far the invasive vector insect S. titanus is still enlarging its distribution within the risk assessment area...|$|E
40|$|The {{leafhopper}} Scaphoideus titanus (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) is a vector of the phytoplasma {{causing the}} <b>Flavescence</b> dorée of grapevine {{which is one}} of the most economically threatening disease of European vineyards. In plant disease solely transmitted by insects, pathogen transmission occurs during the feeding behaviour, therefore quantifying the different feeding activities is a key to understand the disease transmission process. Feeding behaviour of piercing-sucking insects can be studied using the electrical penetration graph technique (EPG). This technique has been popularized by Tjallingi in the 1980 s and further works especially on aphids. By connecting the insect and the plant in an electrical circuit it is possible to monitor electrical resistance fluctuations during probing. These voltage fluctuations occur in a number of distinctive patterns called waveforms that have been correlated to different behaviours according to the stylets position into the leaf and to feeding activity (salivation, puncture, ingestion, etc…). We have adapted this technique to S. titanus in order to investigate if differences in the feeding behaviour between non infected males and females could explain different ability in phytoplasma transmission. EPG waveforms representing probing activities were obtained from adult S. titanus probing in Cabernet Sauvignon cultivar. Three waveforms: salivation, phloem and xylem ingestion were characterized in both sexes by comparing them to previously published ones for other Hemipteran species. The first interesting result is that xylem ingestion occurred in both sexes, while S. titanus is always described as a phloem feeder. Interestingly, males exhibited more frequent and longer activity in phloem. The number, mean and total durations of each type of waveform differed significantly depending on the sex. Feeding behaviour differences affect the ability to acquire and then to inoculate phytoplasma and may partly explain the higher rates of transmission of <b>Flavescence</b> dorée phytoplasma that were obtained in the laboratory with males...|$|E

Two FD strains, FD 92 and FD-D, detected in France and Italy, respectively, were identical in both DNA fragments, confirming previous results. Other FD strains were all very similar and most closely resembled ALY, an Italian alder phytoplasma. Phytoplasmas associated with German Palatinate grapevine yellows were shown to form a distinct subcluster, also different from the elm yellows phytoplasma subcluster.

We used a simulated intraspecific disturbance signal, which was played back to the animals using a minishaker attached to the substrate, or a loudspeaker placed next to it. We have also tested requirements for efficiency of this technique and its limitations in laboratory and semi-field conditions, focusing particularly on amplitude threshold for behavioural effect, diel activation pattern, and means of transmitting disturbance signals to host plants.

40|$|The phytoplasma-borne disease <b>flavescence</b> dorée {{is still}} a threat to European viticulture, despite {{mandatory}} control measures and prophylaxis against the leafhopper vector. Given the economic importance of grapevine, {{it is essential to}} find alternative strategies to contain the spread, in order to possibly reduce the current use of harmful insecticides. Further studies of the pathogen, the vector and the mechanisms of phytoplasma-host interactions could improve our understanding of the disease. In this work, RNA-Seq technology followed by three de novo assembly strategies was used to provide the first comprehensive transcriptomics landscape of <b>flavescence</b> dorée phytoplasma (FD) infecting field-grown Vitis vinifera leaves. With an average of 8300 FD-mapped reads per library, we assembled 347 sequences, corresponding to 215 annotated genes, and identified 10 previously unannotated genes, 15 polycistronic transcripts and three genes supposedly localized in the gaps of the FD 92 draft genome. Furthermore, we improved the annotation of 44 genes with the addition of 5 '/ 3 ' untranslated regions. Functional classification revealed that the most expressed genes were either related to translation and protein biosynthesis or hypothetical proteins with unknown function. Some of these hypothetical proteins were predicted to be secreted, so they could be bacterial effectors with a potential role in modulating the interaction with the host plant. Interestingly, qRT-PCR validation of the RNA-Seq expression values confirmed that a group II intron represented the FD genomic region with the highest expression during grapevine infection. This mobile element may contribute to the genomic plasticity that is necessary for the phytoplasma to increase its fitness and endorse host-adaptive strategies. The RNA-Seq technology was successfully applied {{for the first time to}} analyse the FD global transcriptome profile during grapevine infection.

Laboratory results confirmed that kaolin increased nymph mortality. In organic vineyards, kaolin and pyrethrins are valuable tools in the management of FD.

We studied the role of signal intensity for the mating behaviour in Scaphoideus titanus, a vibrational communicating leafhopper that is a vector of the lethal phytoplasma grapevine disease <b>Flavescence</b> dorée. As males called for the females {{and the intensity of}} the female replies was in the range between 0. 0005 - 0. 001 mm/s, males either walked around randomly and emitted long, irregular identification signals, or performed call-fly behaviour, by jumping off the plant after a female reply. As the male was approaching the female and the perceived intensity of the reply increased to more than 0. 001 mm/s, a short location duet with more regular pulse latencies took place. Only when male and female were on the same leaf, courtship duets with regular male and female pulse emissions were recorded with intensities < 0. 01 mm/s. These results show that the rate of signal production and the perceived signal intensity are necessary parameters for species recognition or for location of the conspecific partner...|$|E
40|$|<b>Flavescence</b> dore´e (FD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely known grapevine yellows disease and one of the most {{unabated}} worldwide in the viticulture sector. In this paper, we outline a strategy for developing an integrated system of technologies to enable rapid, early disease FD detection and diagnosis. We propose the deployment of a newly developed sensor device, the differential mobility spectrometer (DMS), which has shown positive results with a similar vector-borne disease in Citrus. We have previously demonstrated that the gas chromatograph DMS (GC/DMS) can distinguish various citrus diseases, and the system may also allow detection of volatile organic compound (VOC) signals from a tree of other plant systems of unknown health status. This would be achieved by comparing it with the expected VOC profile analysis of healthy or infected trees for health status determination. We can map regions in the GC/DMS signal to gas chromatography mass spectrometry data, thus allowing for deconvolution of specific GC/DMS signatures. We showed that RNA-seq will allow identifying genes involved in volatile pathways (terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, and mevalonate pathways) and could be used to guide the DMS use for the discovery of new biomarkers...|$|E
