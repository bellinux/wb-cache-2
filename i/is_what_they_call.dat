They provide an outline that summarily explains how ontological hermeneutic counseling, or RCP, is done in psychotherapy: ...|$|E
2500|$|At Stephen King's request, Ellison {{provided}} {{a description of}} himself and his writing in Danse Macabre. [...] "My work is foursquare for chaos. I spend my life personally, and my work professionally, keeping the soup boiling. [...] <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> you when {{you are no longer}} dangerous; I much prefer troublemaker, malcontent, desperado. I see myself as a combination of Zorro and Jiminy Cricket. My stories go out from here and raise hell. From time to time some denigrater or critic with umbrage will say of my work, 'He only wrote that to shock.' I smile and nod. Precisely." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gladstone was {{increasingly}} {{uneasy about the}} direction in which British politics was moving. In a letter to Lord Acton on 11 February 1885, Gladstone criticised Tory Democracy as [...] "demagogism" [...] that [...] "put down pacific, law-respecting, economic elements that ennobled the old Conservatism" [...] but [...] "still, in secret, as obstinately attached as ever to the evil principle of class interests". He found contemporary Liberalism better, [...] "but far from being good". Gladstone claimed that this Liberalism's [...] "pet idea <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> construction,– that is to say, taking {{into the hands of the}} state the business of the individual man". Both Tory Democracy and this new Liberalism, Gladstone wrote, had done [...] "much to estrange me, and had for many, many years".|$|E

2500|$|Giratina's {{design change}} {{was one of}} the first things {{revealed}} about Platinum. In designing the new form, they paid attention to details; the designer redrew Giratina several times, attempting to make it look different from its form in Diamond and Pearl. They finalized its design as an [...] "antimatter Pokémon". Masuda explained antimatter as well as E=MC2 to the developers. He also explained the [...] "Reversed Mt. Fuji", which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> the reflection of Mt. Fuji. While Kawachimaru didn't understand it at first, he later incorporated them into the game. The Distortion World was based on these ideas, described as the [...] "core concept" [...] of the game. They also added the Wi-Fi Plaza and Battle Frontier modes to improve players' ability to share information with other players. An idea that the developers wanted to include was to allow players to communicate with family and friends more easily; the developers felt that the Battle Frontier realized this idea.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, General," [...] said Ephraim, uncomfortably, [...] "I {{never liked}} {{the notion of}} gittin' paid for it. You see, I <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> a war-Democrat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> {{the deserted}} beds," [...] he said again. [...] "Nobody owns them, so the oyster pirates {{come down and}} make a bluff at working them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a howwid thmell of whithkey!" [...] lisped Cornet Fitch, of the Dragoons, to Miss Lucy, confidentially. [...] "And the--the <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> Whigth, <b>are</b> <b>they?</b> He! he!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, it <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> a high {{pressure}} engine," [...] said Forester. [...] "It works against {{the pressure of}} the atmosphere. All such engines throw out the steam in puffs." ...|$|E

6000|$|In a {{perfectly}} matter-of-fact way Mrs. Smiley replied: [...] "Many {{of the spirit}} voices are very faint, and cannot be heard without this horn. I <b>am</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> a 'trumpet medium,'" [...] she added, in further explanation.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} {{happened}} to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> a Wild Afternoon. Father and Mother {{went out to}} pay calls; Miss Blake went for a ride on her bicycle, and they were left all alone till eight o'clock.|$|R
6000|$|... "Papa," [...] she answered, [...] "I {{will never}} again ask you {{to give him a}} single penny. That must be {{altogether}} between you and him. He <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> a speculator. Money is not safe with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he had said, [...] "Charley Hapgood <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> {{a rising}} young man--somebody told me as much. And it is true. He'll make the Governor's Chair before he dies, and, who knows? maybe the United States Senate." ...|$|E
6000|$|In Australia is {{prevalent}} {{a horrible}} disease {{due to an}} [...] "unperfected tapeworm."

60|$|Pony said he didn't {{know whether}} {{he would like to}} be quite so big; and then the circus man said perhaps he would rather go for an India-rubber man; that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> the contortionists in those days.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{week later}} {{we were told}} that Guttorm was dying, and {{that he wanted to be}} buried inside the castle; for we had {{discovered}} that the people <b>were</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> Christians, and that they had consecrated ground there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to call the {{southernwood}} 'appleringie' after this. Beverley says that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> it in Scotland, and I think it sounds so much more poetical than southernwood. Felicity says the right name is 'Boy's Love,' but I think that sounds silly.|$|E

60|$|For {{every two}} guests {{there was a}} {{decanter}} of wine. At least it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> wine, though in taste {{it was more like}} sour cider. The people generally used it by pouring a little of it into their water.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} makes you think I have any influence," [...] said Jolyon; [...] "but if I have I'm bound to use it in the {{direction}} of <b>what</b> I think <b>is</b> her happiness. I <b>am</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> a 'feminist,' I believe." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{only thing}} we had then, <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> a thermofax machine, which was very strange. It was on a very bad tissue paper kind of thing and a very obscure image. But we were desperate {{and it was the}} only way to make copies.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Wrayburn. Mr Eugene Wrayburn. He <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> a barrister, {{with nothing}} to do.

6000|$|... "Wal'," [...] {{said the}} Captain, who {{by this time}} had found his soundings; [...] "that you've been a-tellin' <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> a play, and I've seen 'em act it at a theatre, when I was to Liverpool once.

6000|$|... "Chopping {{down trees}} for sawmills, or {{something}} of the kind. The man said Geoffrey had evidently <b>been</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> 'up against it' until lately when {{he seems to have}} got upon his feet. It will probably convince you that you were perfectly right in not marrying him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I've been to San Francisco and to New York, {{and also}} {{up in the}} mining districts of the Northwest Territory, and in the mines of Mexico.
