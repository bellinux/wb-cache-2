40|$|We {{present a}} novel method for {{determining}} the surface density of protoplanetary disks through consideration of disk "dust lines," which indicate the observed disk radial scale at different observational wavelengths. This method relies {{on the assumption that}} the processes of particle growth and drift control the radial scale of the disk at late stages of disk evolution such that the lifetime of the disk is equal to both the drift timescale and growth timescale of the maximum particle size at a given <b>dust</b> <b>line.</b> We provide an initial proof of concept of our model through an application to the disk TW Hya and are able to estimate the disk dust-to-gas ratio, CO abundance, and accretion rate in addition to the total disk surface density. We find that our derived surface density profile and dust-to- gas ratio are consistent with the lower limits found through measurements of HD gas. The CO ice line also depends on surface density through grain adsorption rates and drift and we find that our theoretical CO ice line estimates have clear observational analogues. We further apply our model to a large parameter space of theoretical disks and find three observational diagnostics that may be used to test its validity. First, we predict that the dust lines of disks other than TW Hya will be consistent with the normalized CO surface density profile shape for those disks. Second, surface density profiles that we derive from disk ice lines should match those derived from disk dust lines. Finally, we predict that disk dust and ice lines will scale oppositely, as a function of surface density, across a large sample of disks. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (Grant DGE 1339067...|$|E

Deconvolved images show that the infrared emission extends north to south in the inner 2 ", consisting of a central peak, a component extending 1 " north of the central source, a component extending 1 " south of the central source, and several smaller structures located 1 " to the northeast. The central peak is extended 0. 4 " N-S and unresolved (= 2 pc^ 2, and may thus contain a compact source such as a parsec-scale torus. We observe a correspondence between the northern extension and the northeastern sources appearing on the mid-infrared images and the [OIII] clouds A-C & E. We interpret the faint optical counterpart to the mid-infrared southern extension as being due to partial obscuration by the intervening disk of the host galaxy. The N-S extension of the mid-infrared emission coincides with one wall of the conical narrow line region and aligns with the N-S orientation of the radio jet close to the nucleus.

40|$|Aims. We {{track the}} time {{evolution}} of planet traps and snowlines in a viscously evolving protoplanetary disk using an opacity table {{that accounts for}} {{the composition of the}} dust material. Methods. We coupled a dynamical and thermodynamical disk model with a temperature-dependent opacity table (that accounts for the sublimation of the main dust components) to investigate the formation and evolution of snowlines and planet traps during the first million years of disk evolution. Results. Starting from a minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN), we find that the disk mid-plane temperature profile shows several plateaux (0. 1 - 1 AU wide) at the different sublimation temperatures of the species that make up the dust. For water ice, the correspond- ing plateau can be larger than 1 AU, which means that this is a snow "region" rather than a snow "line". As a consequence, the surface density of solids in the snow region may increase gradually, not abruptly. Several planet traps and desert regions appear naturally as a result of abrupt local changes in the temperature and density profiles over the disk lifetime. These structures are mostly located {{at the edges of the}} temperature plateaux (surrounding the <b>dust</b> sublimation <b>lines)</b> and at the heat-transition barrier where the disk stellar heating and viscous heating are of the same magnitude (around 10 AU after 1 Myr). Conclusions. Several traps are identified: although a few appear to be transient, most of them slowly migrate along with the heat- transition barrier or the <b>dust</b> sublimation <b>lines.</b> These planet traps may temporarily favor the growth of planetary cores.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the radial scales, central surface brightnesses, and colors of 404 disks {{of various types}} of galaxies. The central surface brightness mu 0 and linear disk scale length h vary smoothly along the Hubble sequence of galaxies within a rather narrow interval. The disks of relatively early type galaxies display higher central surface brightnesses in K, higher central surface densities, smaller sizes (relative to {{the diameter of the}} galaxy), redder integrated and central colors. The color gradient normalized to the radius of the galaxy and the blue central surface brightness mu 0 _{ 0,i}(B) of the disk, are both independent of the galaxy type. The radial disk scales in different photometric bands differ less in early-type than in late-type galaxies. The ratio of linear disk scales measured in different photometric bands increases with the isophote ellipticity e of the disk (the inclination of the galaxy); however, the range of the ratio values for each e value exceeds the range of variations of scale lengths ratio over e. The disks in S 0 galaxies have more homogeneous parameters than those in spiral galaxies. However, no sharp boundary in the properties of disks in lenticular, spiral, and irregular galaxies has been found; all parameters vary smoothly along the Hubble sequence. A correlation between the central disk surface brightness and the total luminosity of the galaxy is observed. We also consider the influence of dust on the photometric parameters of the disks. We show that the dust concentrated in <b>dust</b> <b>lines</b> towards the spiral arms and bars does not influence to the scale lengths ratio. Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, 1 table.

This dust was generated {{as part of}} a sequence of processing steps in the manufacture of automobile brake linings. The mean grain size of the <b>lining</b> <b>dust</b> for disposal was 298. 2 mu m, the range being from 24. 9 to 567. 3 mu m. Based on the Toxicity Characteristic Leachability Procedure (TCLP) and the American Nuclear Society (ANS) 16. 1 (modified) leach protocols, although the untreated <b>lining</b> <b>dust</b> contained high concentrations of Zn, Ba, Pb, Fe, Cu, and Cr, solidification with Polymal and Hetron respectively reduced the leachable fraction of these heavy metals in the <b>lining</b> <b>dust</b> to less than 14 and 18 %, compared to untreated control; and the heavy metal concentrations in the TCLP leachate were below the permissible limits set by the Malaysia Environmental Quality Act (EQA) (1974), the Environment Quality (Sewage and Industrial Effluents) Regulations (1979), as well as the USEPA regulatory limit fur TCLP. The final pH of the extract from the untreated dust ranged from 4. 92 to 4. 95, whereas when polymeric resins were used, the pH increased to between 5. 1 and 5. 2. When the ANS 16. 1 (modified) leach test was performed, the leaching rate was highest for Zn, followed by Ba and Pb, while the leaching of Cr, Cu, and Fe was too low for detection. The observed linear relationship between the cumulative fraction leached (CFL) and the square root of the leaching time in all polymer resin treated samples indicates that the mechanism of leaching is mainly through diffusion. The Leachability Index (Li) obtained ranged between 9 and 10, which exceeds the guidance value of 6, clearly indicating that the heavy metal retention within the solidified matrix is quite effective. The hardening time when polymeric resins were used ranged anywhere from 1. 5 to 12 h, and this decreased as the amount of MEK Peroxide initiator was increased. Compressive strength of the brake lining solid matrix was between 53 and 68 MPa, which was much higher than the standard guidance limit for polymeric resin solidification. Between the two resins, Polymal shows better performance in terms of heavy metal retention capability, whereas Hetron exhibits higher compressive strength. Despite the attractive performance features of either of the resins, S/S with either of them appears to be prohibitively expensive for the current Malaysian regulatory marketplace, although attractive elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the absorption and scattering of X-rays observed from the Galactic center. One {{objective is to}} characterize the intrinsic X-ray emission from the central black hole, SgrA*, in its quiescent and flaring states. We correct the fluxes observed by the Chandra and XMM telescopes for absorption and scattering, using realistic models for the dust grain size distribution, gas and dust abundances and spatial distributions. However, there are still large uncertainties. Since much of the intervening dust is close to SgrA*, the scattered halo of X-ray photons is very concentrated: its intensity can dominate the Chandra PSF inside 1 ", and so affects estimates of the point source flux. It also broadens the radial intensity profiles of Galactic center sources - observations of this effect can help constrain models of the spatial distribution of the dust. We estimate that the combined scattering halos from observed Galactic center sources within 10 " of SgrA* contribute up to ~ 10 % of the observed diffuse emission in this region. Dust-scattered photons suffer a time delay relative to the photons that arrive directly. For dust that is 100 pc towards us from the Galactic center, this delay is about 1000 s at angles of 1 ", and 100 ks at 10 ". We illustrate how {{the evolution of the}} scattering halo following X-ray flares from SgrA* or other sources can also help to constrain the <b>dust's</b> <b>line</b> of sight distribution. We discuss the implications of X-ray scattering halos for the intensity of diffuse emission that has been reported within a few arcseconds of SgrA*: in the most extreme, yet viable, model we consider, ~ 1 / 3 of it is due to dust scattering of an unresolved source.

40|$|International audienceContext. Planet {{traps and}} snow lines are {{structures}} that may promote planetary formation in protoplanetary disks. They {{are very sensitive}} to the disk density and temperature structure. It is therefore necessary to follow the time evolution of the disk thermal structure throughout its viscous spreading. Since the snowlines are thought to generate density and temperature bumps, it is important {{to take into account the}} disk opacity variations when the various dust elements are sublimated. Aims. We track the time evolution of planet traps and snowlines in a viscously evolving protoplanetary disk using an opacity table that accounts for the composition of the dust material. Methods. We coupled a dynamical and thermodynamical disk model with a temperature-dependent opacity table (that accounts for the sublimation of the main dust components) to investigate the formation and evolution of snowlines and planet traps during the first million years of disk evolution. Results. Starting from a minimum mass solar nebula, we find that the disk mid-plane temperature profile shows several plateaux (0. 1 − 1 AU wide) at the different sublimation temperatures of the species that make up the dust. For water ice, the corresponding plateau can be larger than 1 AU, which means that this is a snow “region” rather than a snow “line”. As a consequence, the surface density of solids in the snow region may increase gradually, not abruptly. Several planet traps and desert regions appear naturally as a result of abrupt local changes in the temperature and density profiles over the disk lifetime. These structures are mostly located at the edges of the temperature plateaux (surrounding the <b>dust</b> sublimation <b>lines)</b> and at the heat-transition barrier where the disk stellar heating and viscous heating are of the same magnitude (around 10 AU after 1 Myr).
