5|$|For {{protection}} and preservation, a polished Japanese sword needs a scabbard. A <b>fully</b> <b>mounted</b> scabbard (koshirae) may {{consist of a}} lacquered body, a taped hilt, a sword guard (tsuba) and decorative metal fittings. Though the original purpose was to protect a sword from damage, from early times on Japanese sword mountings became a status symbol and were used to add dignity. Starting in the Heian period, a sharp distinction was made between swords designed for use in battle and those for ceremonial use. Tachi long swords were worn edge down suspended by two cords or chains from the waist belt. The cords were attached to two eyelets on the scabbard.|$|E
25|$|An {{independent}} theatre {{company called}} Fancy Bred Theatre produced a special reading of Resurrection Blues as a fundraiser for the Actors' Fund of Canada, in February 2009, in Winnipeg, Canada. The reading was staged {{in a very}} physically animated style, and it ran for three nights before 180 people. The production, featuring many well-known professional local artists, focused mainly on the comedy and absurdities of the script. Audience reception was overall very positive, and the production was a great success. Some audience members even mentioned that the wordy script worked much better in a reading than in a <b>fully</b> <b>mounted</b> show.|$|E
2500|$|Enjoying good {{ticket sales}} {{and hoping to}} ensure its future, LOOM sought to raise funds to {{purchase}} the Eastside Playhouse. [...] However, by 1979, diabetes had blinded William Mount-Burke. He nevertheless continued to conduct performances from memory, to plan LOOM's future, and even to stage new shows after losing his sight completely. [...] For example, in 1980 Mount-Burke directed the first professional production of Arthur Sullivan and B. C. Stephenson's The Zoo given {{anywhere in the world}} since 1879, together with Cox and Box and Trial by Jury, repeating the triple bill the following year. During these seasons, despite Mount-Burke's declining health, the company attracted high-quality professional singers for their casts, generally improved costumes and sets, earned good reviews and enjoyed a seemingly secure financial future. [...] The New York Times wrote, in its preview of LOOM's 1981 spring season, [...] "The three works (Pinafore, Pirates and The Mikado) ...will be done in the best Savoyard tradition. Do not expect a <b>fully</b> <b>mounted</b> D'Oyly Carte theatrical version.... Expect, however, to hear some fine voices and to be entertained." ...|$|E

60|$|Early dawn {{began to}} break. The sky {{was clear and}} cloudless. The Tatars were on their walls, the Russians in their trenches; the Imperial eagle standard, which Ivan had lately assumed, floated in the morning wind. The two armies were {{perfectly}} silent, save here and there the bray of a single trumpet, or beat of a naker drum in one or the other, and the continuous hum of the hymns and chants from the three Russian chapel- tents. The archers held their arrows on the string, the gunners stood with lighted matches. The copper-clad domes of the minarets began to glow with the rising sunbeams; the muezzins were on the roofs about to call the Moslemin to prayer; the deacon in the Tzar's chapel-tent was reading the Gospel. 'There shall be one fold and one Shepherd.' At that moment the sun's disk appeared above the eastern hills, and ere yet the red orb had <b>fully</b> <b>mounted</b> above the horizon, there was a burst as it were of tremendous thunderings, and the ground shook beneath the church. The Tzar went to the entrance, and found the whole city hill so 'rolled in sable smoke', that he could distinguish nothing, and, going back to his place, desired that the service should continue. The deacon {{was in the midst}} of the prayer for the establishment of the power of the Tzar and the discomfiture of his enemies, when the crushing burst of another explosion rushed upon their ears, and as it died away another voice broke forth, the shout raised by every man in the Russian lines, 'God is with us!' On then they marched towards the openings that the mines had made, but there the dauntless garrison, in spite of the terror and destruction caused by the two explosions, met them with unabated fury, rolling beams or pouring boiling water upon them as they strove to climb the breach, and fighting hand to hand with them if they mounted it. However, by the time the Tzar had completed his devotions and mounted his horse, his eagle could be seen above the smoke upon the citadel.|$|E

50|$|In closed guard, {{the bottom}} {{grappler}} has his legs around the opponent's trunk, and ankles closed together to provide control and {{a barrier to}} escaping the position. The closed guard {{is a very powerful}} guard seen often in MMA style tournaments because of the amount of control it gives the bottom fighter and lack of necessity for grips to control top opponent and block his strikes. This guard allows many setups for submissions such as jointlocks and chokes as well as great opportunities for reversing the opponent into the very dominant <b>fully</b> <b>mounted</b> position.|$|E

50|$|In the 1920s these grand theatres {{were known}} as “presentation houses” and offered a {{combined}} bill of a silent film and a stage show on the same program and for a single admission price. The performances were often presented on a “continuous show” basis. The Victory Symphony Orchestra provided accompaniment for the film and music for the live show as well. The Grand Organ often substituted for the orchestra during matinee performances. The relatively shallow depth of the Victory’s stage suggests that it was designed for “vaudeville” type acts presented along with a film, rather than <b>fully</b> <b>mounted</b> stage productions. The arrival of “talking pictures” in the late 1920s resulted in the eventual elimination of the live portion of the program.|$|E
5000|$|Osipczak faced TUF 7 alumnus, Matthew Riddle on 14 November 2009 at UFC 105 in Manchester, UK. In a pre-fight interview, Osipczak {{stated that}} Riddle has no serious {{finishing}} ability and {{is most often}} than not a fighter who likes to [...] "grind out a decision". Riddle countered the statement by saying that he considers Osipczak without considerable experience against wrestlers, which he attributed to the wider lack of wrestling training of UK MMA fighters. However, Osipczak dominated throughout the fight by showing a superior standing up and striking as well as grappling game. When Osipczak at some point <b>fully</b> <b>mounted</b> Riddle in the final round, he started a vicious ground and pound barrage of punches and elbow strikes which made the referee Mark Goddard to end the fight at 3:53 in the final round. UFC commentator Joe Rogan mentioned {{that this was a}} [...] "huge performance by Osipczak".|$|E
