The initial bid price was set at US$80,000. The item was not sold, possibly because as a registered <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> of Belarus it cannot be transported outside of Belarus. The auction attracted further public attention and in 2006 the Supreme Court of Belarus ruled to nationalize the belt. It is now kept by the Belarusian National History Museum.

The shoes have been on almost constant display with few instances for study during its time at NMAH, and they remain one of the most visited objects within the museum. Plans for an upcoming permanent exhibit, and visible deterioration of the decades-old shoes, led to the present study, which was the first phase of a major effort to preserve this iconic <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> for future generations to enjoy. Materials characterization was used to determine the composition of construction materials and condition of the Ruby Slippers to help plan for the optimal environmental conditions for continued display. The current study is also viewed as a valuable opportunity to learn about the original construction and subsequent history of the Ruby Slippers to inform and enrich NMAH’s curatorial research, public programs, and media initiatives. Analytical methods used to characterize the shoes’ components include micro-X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (µ-XRF), micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (µ-FTIR), polarized light microscopy (PLM), and high-performance liquid chromatography–diode array detector–mass spectrometry (HPLC–DAD–MS).|$|E

Three different conservation treatments, namely freeze-drying, gamma rays, and ethylene oxide fumigation, were compared and monitored to assess their short- (one month, T 1) and long-term (one year, T 2) effectiveness to inhibit fungal growth. After the inoculation with fungi possessing cellulose hydrolysis ability — Chaetomium globosum, Trichoderma viride, and Cladosporium cladosporioides — as single strains or as a mixture, different quality paper samples were treated and screened for fungal viability by culture-dependent and -independent techniques. Results derived from both strategies were contradictory. Both gamma irradiation and EtO fumigation showed full efficacy as disinfecting agents when evaluated with cultivation techniques. However, when using molecular analyses, the application of gamma rays showed a short-term reduction in DNA recovery and DNA fragmentation; the latter phenomenon was also observed in a minor degree in samples treated with freeze-drying. When RNA was used as an indicator of long-term fungal viability, differences in the RNA recovery from samples treated with freeze-drying or gamma rays could be observed in samples inoculated with the mixed culture. Only the treatment with ethylene oxide proved negative for both DNA and RNA recovery. Therefore, DNA fragmentation after an ethylene oxide treatment can hamper future paleogenetic and archaeological molecular studies on the objects...|$|R

40|$|The color {{techniques}} used in sculpting <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> {{change over the}} years. The demand to restore a unique version of history {{to the detriment of}} the rest of time motivates us to research to attain full restoration of the polychromes (painting on stone). This problem, along with currently prevailing non-invasive trends in restoration, lead us to use Augmented Reality to achieve virtual restoration of the portico of the Saint Mary’s Cathedral in Vitoria (Spain). By projecting the rendered image of the 3 D model of the polychromed sculpture in real time over the original sculpture, we can make the sculpture appear to the eyes of the observer as if it had the same polychromes/paint as it did in the past. In this fashion, we achieve the desired restoration effect without touching the stone while being able to show the polychromes of each and every one of the eras that the portico has stored up. To carry out this project, we need to conduct a study prior to the use of projectors on the portico, and, in effect, the offered solution to use the Augmented Reality is valid to obtain the restoration objective. Due to the fact that the portico is not able to be worked on, we cannot do a complete, on site study. We solve this problem by conducting a 3 D simulation of the entire portico. With the virtual portico, we can validate the display of the polychromes and the layout and lighting over the projectors. To validate the restoration using projectors, we test the projection o...|$|R

40|$|Current {{treatments}} <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> as {{an object}} of moral concern (whether it be the heritage of mankind or of some particular group of people) have tended to treat it as a means to ensure human wellbeing: either as ‘cultural property’ or ‘cultural patrimony’, suggesting concomitant rights of possession and exclusion, or otherwise as something which, gaining its ethical significance from the roles it plays in people’s lives and the formation of their identities, is the beneficiary at most of indirect moral obligations. In contrast, I argue that <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage,</b> as something whose existence can go well or badly, can itself qualify as a moral patient towards which we may have obligations which need not be accounted for in terms of subsequent benefits to human beings. Drawing inspiration from environmental ethics and suggesting that heritage, like an ecosystem, is a complex network of interrelations which invites a holistic understanding, I develop a framework for thinking about <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> which shows how such a thing can feature in our ethical reflections as intrinsically worthy of respect in spite of its most obvious differences from the ‘natural’ world: the very human origins <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> and its involvement with human life in all its forms. As part of the development of this framework I consider the epistemic difficulties which arise when for all our holistic sophistication we do find ourselves in the predicament of having to judge the moral worth <b>of</b> some <b>item</b> <b>of</b> heritage, possibly someone else’s heritage and possibly something which we find ourselves disposed to value more because of than despite any mysteries surrounding it.
