5|$|A <b>greenway</b> and/or {{connecting}} trail along Leggetts Creek {{was proposed}} in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan in the early 2000s. The <b>greenway</b> would {{be known as the}} Leggetts Creek <b>greenway.</b> It could link to the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail and could be extended to link to the Tunkhannock <b>greenway.</b> The South Abington Park and the Leggetts Creek Trail are in Chinchilla and the creek flows though the latter. Trestle Hole Park is also along the creek's lower reaches. The Dutch Gap Little League Field is located at Wells Street.|$|E

50|$|The {{basis for}} the FEGN is in the state {{recreational}} trails system, approved by Legislature in 1979, {{as well as the}} Florida Canoe Trail System and preexisting parks, refuges and water and wildlife management areas. In 1991, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection established a Statewide <b>Greenways</b> Program to achieve greater coherence among the state’s large ecologically significant places. Land acquisition for the purpose of conservation in Florida dates back to the early 1960s. The <b>Greenways</b> Program was developed to determine how conservation efforts could be distributed in order to best benefit the nature and people of Florida. In 1993, the Florida <b>Greenways</b> Commission was created, and it assumed guidance of the program, which includes public education programs in addition to the conceptual work of developing the <b>Greenways</b> system. Until 1995, Florida <b>Greenways</b> Commission worked with support from the 1000 Friends of Florida and The Conservation Fund to assess current <b>greenways</b> and plan for future <b>greenways</b> and state agency leadership of the project. The university compiled a database of existent conservation lands and trails in the state under FGC leadership. In 1995 leadership moved to the Florida <b>Greenways</b> Coordinating Council in cooperation with the state DEP's OGT. The university applied GIS software to identify “ecological and recreational hubs and links” to integrate into the network. Hubs are areas with highest-ranked ecological significance that are large enough to sustain key species and ecological processes. Links are the areas connecting the hubs and sites. In 1997, the FEGN, as part of the Florida <b>Greenways</b> Plan became authorized by state law. The <b>Greenways</b> Implementation Plan, a collaborative effort of “ the Florida <b>Greenways</b> Commission, Florida <b>Greenways</b> Coordinating Council, state, regional, and federal agencies, scientists, university personnel, conservation groups, planners and the general public,” was completed in 1998. The next year, the Florida <b>Greenways</b> and Trail Council (FGTC) took over the work of the Commission and the FGCC. Support from the OGT continued, and the OGT established an “official <b>greenways</b> designation process.” In the following year, the Florida <b>Greenways</b> and Trails Council prioritized the network into 6 different levels of significance, based on their importance for maintaining statewide ecological connectivity. The university, using GIS software, developed a prioritization of land presenting the best opportunities to create a connected statewide ecological system in 2002. Jason Teisinger modeled development pressure, allowing prioritization of critical linkages based on ecological significance and pressure of development. In 2004 the boundaries of the Florida Ecological Network were updated and approved by the Florida <b>Greenways</b> and Trails Council in September., In 2005 Prioritization of land use was updated and approved by the Florida <b>Greenways</b> and Trails Council in November.|$|R
50|$|<b>Greenways</b> are narrow {{strips of}} land, planted {{and managed to}} provide both human {{recreation}} and wildlife habitat. <b>Greenways</b> along streams, such as Little Sugar Creek, improve water quality and help control flooding. There are about 37 miles of developed <b>greenways</b> in Mecklenburg County, of which this is only one.|$|R
5|$|In 1967, {{when the}} King Island emu was still {{thought to be}} only known from prehistoric remains, James <b>Greenway</b> {{questioned}} whether {{they could have been}} exterminated by a few natives, and speculated that fires started by prehistoric men or lightning may have been responsible. At this time, the mainland emu was also threatened by overhunting, and <b>Greenway</b> cautioned that it could end up sharing the fate of its island relatives if no measures were taken in time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan {{recommended}} constructing a <b>greenway</b> and connecting trail along Roaring Brook. Planned trails in the <b>greenway</b> include the North Pocono rail trail and {{a link to}} the Nay Aug Park. The conservation plan recommended linking such a trail to the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail. A proposed pedestrian loop trail would have a footbridge over the stream.|$|E

50|$|<b>Greenways</b> {{are found}} in rural areas as well as urban. Corridors redeveloped as <b>greenways</b> often travel through both city and country, {{connecting}} them together. Even in rural areas <b>greenways</b> serve the purpose of providing residents access to open land managed as parks, as contrasted with land that is vegetated but inappropriate for public use, such as agricultural land. Where the historic rural road network has been enlarged and redesigned to favor highspeed automobile travel, <b>greenways</b> provide an alternative {{for people who are}} elderly, young, less mobile or seeking a reflective pace.|$|R
40|$|Although the {{development}} of <b>greenways</b> is an increasingly popular trend, little {{research has focused on}} evaluating plans to determine how well they address sustainability principles. For this study, the authors completed a qualitative analysis of 32 plans, and a quantitative analysis of 27 plans from jurisdictions in northwest Indiana that address <b>greenways</b> and open space. Evaluations were based upon an established system to evaluate sustainability that the researchers modified for <b>greenways.</b> Plans are ranked based upon their quality and a qualitative analysis and description of each ranking are provided. Results from an ordered logit model show that the most significant determinants of plan-rank in relation to <b>greenways</b> are the population size of the planning jurisdiction, ratio of the population that is white, and population residing in the same house for five or more years. A spatial analysis of plan-rank reveals that there is no clustering of highly ranked plans. <b>greenways,</b> plan evaluation, sustainability principles, Indiana, plan quality, <b>greenways</b> planning,...|$|R
5|$|The {{city and}} {{government}} {{decided to change}} the type of development allowed near the river. The floodplain bordering the Red River was converted into a large park known as the Greater Grand Forks <b>Greenway.</b> This provided new recreation space for city residents, as well as space for future floodwaters to be absorbed naturally by trees and other plants, without damage to infrastructure. East Grand Forks developed a related <b>greenway</b> park on its side of the river, as it has also suffered extensive flooding that year.|$|E

5|$|After Sulphur Dell was {{dismantled}} on April 16, 1969, the ballpark's sunken {{field was}} filled in with rock, dirt, and {{the remains of}} the demolished Andrew Jackson Hotel. It was then converted to a number of state-owned parking lots for the nearby the Tennessee State Capitol. While Sulphur Dell was nestled in an area that was home to the city's garbage dump, stockyards, the Atlantic Ice House building, and other various warehouses, First Tennessee Park is now surrounded by new apartments, parking ramps, and restaurants. The facade surrounding the home plate entrance on the stadium's north side is constructed from cast ultra-high-performance concrete planks, zinc panels, and an array of windows that stretches across the full width of the entrance. To the south of the stadium, beyond the outfield wall, is an area that connects the city's Cumberland River <b>Greenway</b> to the Bicentennial Mall <b>Greenway.</b> It will be open to the public on non-game days after the surrounding apartment buildings and retail spaces are completed in spring 2018.|$|E

5|$|The two {{assigned}} Necropsittacus {{species have}} since become {{the source of}} much taxonomic confusion, and their identities have been debated. N. borbonicus later received common names such as Réunion red and green parakeet or Réunion parrot, and N. francicus {{has been called the}} Mauritian parrot. The Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachisuka recognised N. borbonicus in 1953, and published a restoration of it with the colouration described by Dubois and the body-plan of the Rodrigues parrot. He did not find the naming of N. francicus to have been necessary, but expressed hope more evidence would be found. In 1967, the American ornithologist James <b>Greenway</b> suggested that N. borbonicus may have been an escaped pet lory seen by Dubois, since 16th century Dutch paintings show the somewhat similar East Indian chattering lory (Lorius garrulus), presumably in captivity. However, <b>Greenway</b> was unable to find any references that matched those Rothschild had given for N. francicus.|$|E
5|$|There were unfounded rumours of its {{continued}} existence until {{the beginning of}} the 20th century.

Hume countered that these islets were probably too small to sustain a population.|$|E
5|$|With {{development}} in {{and near the}} river came increased pollution. By the late 1930s, efforts to stem the pollution led to formation of a state sanitary board to oversee modest cleanup efforts. In the 1960s, Oregon Governor Tom McCall led a push for stronger pollution controls on the Willamette. In this, he was encouraged by Robert (Bob) Straub—the state treasurer and future Oregon governor (1975)—who first proposed a Willamette <b>Greenway</b> program during his 1966 gubernatorial campaign against McCall. The Oregon State Legislature established the program in 1967. Through it, {{state and local governments}} cooperated in creating or improving a system of parks, trails, and wildlife refuges along the river. In 1998, the Willamette became one of 14 rivers designated an American Heritage River by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. By 2007 the <b>Greenway</b> had grown to include more than 170 separate land parcels, including 10 state parks. Public uses of the river and land along its shores include camping, swimming, fishing, boating, hiking, bicycling, and wildlife viewing.|$|E
