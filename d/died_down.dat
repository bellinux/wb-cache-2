5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that a ceasefire was {{scheduled}} to come into force throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina on 12 October, OG Centre continued its advance northeast of Sanski Most, engaging the bulk of the VRS 43rd Motorised Brigade in a series of clashes. This fighting resulted in little change to the territory held by either side by 20 October, when fighting <b>died</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|In November 2009, Rambhadracharya {{was accused}} of {{tampering}} with the epic, but the dispute <b>died</b> <b>down</b> after Rambhadracharya expressed his regret for any annoyance or pain caused by the publication. A writ petition was also filed against him but it was dismissed. This edition was published in 2005 by Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas.|$|E

5|$|Just as the furore {{appeared}} to have <b>died</b> <b>down,</b> in April 1952 Sydney's Daily Mirror published {{a letter from a}} reader, Jacob Raith. Responding to a letter in support of Barnes, Raith sided with the Board and suggested that his character was to blame for the omission. Acting on legal advice, Barnes sued Raith for libel and engaged Sydney's leading barrister, Jack Shand KC, as counsel.|$|E
5|$|Boycott's commentating career continued, however, as he {{was able}} to carry on working overseas, {{particularly}} in India. He hosted The Sunny and Boycs Show with Sunil Gavaskar and he hosted the touring Indian team at his home in August 2002. He worked in South Africa and coached the Pakistan cricket team upon request. In 2001, as resentment towards him in the British media following the court case <b>died</b> <b>down,</b> he was reinstated as a writer for British newspapers, and there was speculation that he would lead Lancashire Cricket Club following the departure of Bobby Simpson, though Mike Watkinson eventually took the role.|$|E
5|$|Brussels {{also has}} better {{transport}} links than Strasbourg, with lower pay for civil servants which reduce costs. Some commentators further underline that night-life in Strasbourg is comparatively lacklustre and that MEPs who'd wish to relax {{after a long}} and hard working day aren't offered many opportunities to do so. The position of Strasbourg suffered a minor blow in 2006, when allegations surfaced over charges {{by the city of}} Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament was renting. The controversy <b>died</b> <b>down</b> when the European Parliament decided to officially buy the buildings on 24 October 2006.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of 5–6 November, {{fighting}} <b>died</b> <b>down</b> after a ceasefire was brokered in The Hague. The lull {{was used by the}} 137th Infantry Brigade to extract its encircled troops and civilians near the Korana River, east of Malići. The JNA column began moving south again at dawn; it reached Malići at about 9:00a.m., crossed the Korana River (over the village bridge and a pontoon bridge) by 11:00 and proceeded to Vojnić. Shortly afterwards, the Logorište barracks and its surroundings were secured by the HV.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{artillery}} strikes continued, eventually {{forcing the}} ICU frontlines to falter. A mutiny within the ICU caused their forces to disintegrate, and abandon both Jilib and Kismayo. At 10p.m., {{the sounds of}} battle <b>died</b> <b>down.</b> By midnight, the ICU front in Jilib had collapsed, and the ICU began to flee. By 2:00a.m., they had fled from Kismayo. Local militiamen patrolled the streets, and looting began of former ICU property. They were reported to be fleeing towards Ras Kamboni island in southern Somalia, or the Kenyan border.|$|E
5|$|Lukashenko blamed {{foreign governments}} for conspiring against him and, in April 1998, {{expelled}} ambassadors from the Drazdy complex near Minsk and moved them to another building. The Drazdy conflict caused an international outcry {{and resulted in}} a travel ban on Lukashenko from the EU and the US. Although the ambassadors eventually returned after the controversy <b>died</b> <b>down,</b> Lukashenko stepped up his rhetorical attacks against the West. He stated that Western governments were trying to undermine Belarus at all levels, even sports, during the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.|$|E

5|$|On 10 September 2007, Licciardello rang a {{talkback}} {{radio station}} {{pretending to be}} someone else, and complained about the stunt, claiming that it was stupid and anyone involved at the ABC, including Kerry O'Brien, should be jailed for ten years. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said {{he wished he had}} made the call on the evening of the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already <b>died</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|While the Stallions {{experienced}} a successful {{year on the}} field, and finished second to Edmonton in average attendance, the city's excitement of 1994 <b>died</b> <b>down.</b> Attendance declined, with season ticket sales dropping to around 17,000. Later reports suggested that attendance numbers had been inflated by giveaways and the team projected some losses in 1995. Despite these difficulties, the Stallions remained the model that lent expansion credibility; other American owners looked to Baltimore in deciding {{on the future of}} their own teams.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to these}} losses, the {{battalion}} {{did not return}} to the front until July 1944. It subsequently took part in the Allied advance towards Florence and {{is believed to have been}} first to reach the city on 4 August. During this time Major Arapeta Awatere led the battalion as its acting commanding officer after Young was hospitalised with jaundice, although he returned in late August and subsequently led them through the fighting around Rimini in September. In November, Awatere took over command substantively, and in December the battalion launched an attack around Faenza, for which its commanding officer later received a Distinguished Service Order. The winter snow set in after this and, as Allied attentions were temporarily focused elsewhere, offensive action <b>died</b> <b>down.</b> Thus, throughout January, February and into March the battalion undertook defensive duties, before being withdrawn from the line in mid-March.|$|E

5|$|Order in {{the streets}} broke down as rumours arose of {{suspicious}} foreigners setting fires. The fears of the homeless focused on the French and Dutch, England's enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial immigrant groups became victims of lynchings and street violence. On Tuesday, the fire spread {{over most of the}} City, destroying St Paul's Cathedral and leaping the River Fleet to threaten Charles II's court at Whitehall, while coordinated firefighting efforts were simultaneously mobilising. The battle to quench the fire is considered to have been won by two factors: the strong east winds <b>died</b> <b>down,</b> and the Tower of London garrison used gunpowder to create effective firebreaks to halt further spread eastward.|$|E
5|$|The {{assistant}} US divisional commander, Brigadier General William A. McCulloch, {{arrived in}} the afternoon to begin directing the battle on Hill 206, and afterwards reinforcements {{in the form of}} flamethrower teams from the 132nd Infantry Regiment also arrived. In the afternoon American forces attempted to regain the South Knob. While this effort was initially successful and led to the extraction of several American soldiers who had been isolated on the position, by late afternoon the US units had been forced to withdraw to the North Knob. The fighting on Hill 206 <b>died</b> <b>down</b> in the evening of 11March as neither the Japanese nor US forces attempted any offensive action, although Muda took the opportunity to concentrate his forces completely in occupation of the South Knob and established several pillboxes overnight.|$|E
5|$|The brawl {{started after}} the hour mark; Winterburn made a lunging tackle on Irwin, who was {{challenging}} Limpar for the ball. McClair and Irwin retaliated against Winterburn and Limpar, whom Ince pushed onto the advertising hoardings. All 11 United players and 10 Arsenal players on the pitch partook in the melee (goalkeeper David Seaman was the only player to remain uninvolved), though most were attempting to calm the situation. The fracas lasted less than 20 seconds; once it <b>died</b> <b>down,</b> Hackett booked Limpar and Winterburn for their involvement, while the United players escaped punishment. Tony Adams, praised by The Guardian correspondent Stephen Bierley {{for his role in}} defusing matters, avoided a caution for a professional foul on McClair later on.|$|E

5|$|The sack of Amorium brought al-Mu'tasim much acclaim as a warrior-caliph and ghāzī, and {{was celebrated}} by contemporaries, {{most notably in}} Abu Tammam's famous ode. The Abbasids, however, did not follow up on their success. Warfare {{continued}} between the two empires with raids and counter-raids along the border, {{but after a few}} Byzantine successes a truce was agreed in 841. At {{the time of his death}} in 842, al-Mu'tasim was preparing yet another large-scale invasion, but the great fleet he had prepared to assault Constantinople perished in a storm off Cape Chelidonia a few months later. Following al-Mu'tasim's death, warfare gradually <b>died</b> <b>down,</b> and the Battle of Mauropotamos in 844 was the last major Arab–Byzantine engagement for a decade.|$|E
5|$|As the IX Corps {{gave up on}} Triangle Hill, the PVA 31st Division of the 12th Corps was in {{position}} to take back Sniper Ridge. Under the cover of inclement weather, an assault was launched by the 92nd Regiment at 4pm on November 11. The Chinese soon drove off the defending 1st Battalion of the ROK 32nd Regiment, but Chung Il-kwon immediately replied with a counterattack by the ROK 17th Regiment of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the dawn of November 12. After two hours of fighting, the 1st Battalion of the ROK 17th Regiment recaptured two-thirds of Sniper Ridge and inflicted heavy casualties on the PVA 92nd Regiment. The 31st Division relieved the 92nd Regiment with its 93rd Regiment to launch another assault on November 14, but the ROK 17th Regiment responded by committing all units to blunt the attack. By November 17, {{with the help of}} the ROK 1st Field Artillery Group, the ROK 2nd Battalion returned to the 1st Battalion's original position after a two-hour battle. Undeterred by heavy casualties, the PVA 106th Regiment of the 34th Division, 12th Corps relieved the weakened 93rd Regiment during the night of November18. For the next six days, 'seesaw' fighting continued on Sniper Ridge. By November 25, the ROK 2nd Infantry Division was relieved by the ROK 9th Infantry Division on Sniper Ridge and the fighting finally <b>died</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Banovina, the JNA {{reached the}} Kupa River and {{captured}} its entire southern bank, except for ZNG bridgeheads {{in the areas}} of Nebojan, Sunja and Sisak, on 30 September. No further advances were achieved there. The JNA attempted an additional push towards the Nebojan bridgehead via Novi Farkašić on 1718 October, and another towards Sunja on 2 November, but both attempts failed. On 4 October, the JNA initiated an attack in Kordun, in the area of Karlovac, pushing the ZNG back in the area of Slunj two days later. On 8 October, it reached the banks of the Kupa and Korana Rivers and the intensity of fighting <b>died</b> <b>down.</b> The greatest flare-up of hostilities in the area occurred on 45 November when a JNA garrison based in a suburb of Karlovac broke through the ZNG siege in the Battle of Logorište and reached JNA-held territory to the east of the city. Further south, the JNA captured Slunj on 17 November and Cetingrad on 29 November, eliminating a ZNG pocket in Kordun. JNA activity in Lika was limited to shelling and air raids on Gospić and Otočac, peaking on 4 October.|$|E
