50|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>{{cleaning}},</b> {{also known}} as flame gouging, {{is the process of}} cleaning a structural steel surface by passing an intensely hot oxyacetylene flame over it. Mill scale and rust are removed by the reducing effect of the flame and the action of the heat, leaving the surface in a condition suitable for wire brushing and painting.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} uses for <b>flame</b> <b>cleaning</b> {{rather than just}} to remove rust and mill scale. It is also used as a removal tool for paints, bad welds, burrs, {{mechanical}} wear (scraping, cuts, gouges and more) along with other surface imperfections.The process of <b>flame</b> <b>cleaning</b> is not anything new and does not require any extra equipment than what would {{be found in a}} typical metal shop. It is just an oxygen-fuel torch that is used parallel with the surface to melt and blow off any blemishes that the operator wants to eliminate. Shown in the adjacent diagram, the surface is blasted with the oxygen-fuel torch across the surface versus the orthodox use of the flame as a cutting or gouging tool. Though the equipment is the same, the flame used in cleaning is drastically reduced to prevent excess removal of the surface. Various kinds of fuel can be run with the oxygen, for example acetylene.|$|E
30|$|Ticks were boiled in 10 % KOH {{solution}} in test tube over the <b>flame</b> for <b>cleaning</b> of abdomen {{and ease of}} examination. The collected ticks were identified on dissection microscope based on morphology {{with the help of}} the keys (Foreyt, 2001.; Solusby, 1982; Urquhart et al., 1996).|$|R
50|$|It is {{applicable}} to hot rolling steel surfaces prepared for painting by {{methods such as}} blast-cleaning, hand and power tool cleaning and <b>flame</b> <b>cleaning,</b> although these methods rarely lead to comparable results. Essentially, these methods are intended for hot-rolled steel, but blast-cleaning methods, in particular, {{could also be used}} on cold rolling steel of sufficient thickness to withstand any deformation caused by the impact of the abrasive or the effects of power tool cleaning.|$|E
50|$|Mill {{scale is}} a {{nuisance}} when the steel {{is to be}} processed. Any paint applied over it is wasted, since it will come off with the scale as moisture-laden air gets under it. Thus mill scale can be removed from steel surfaces by <b>flame</b> <b>cleaning,</b> pickling, or abrasive blasting, which are all tedious operations that consume energy. This is why shipbuilders and steel fixers used to leave steel and rebar delivered freshly rolled from mills {{out in the open}} to allow it to 'weather' until most of the scale fell off due to atmospheric action. Nowadays most steel mills can supply their produce with mill scale removed and steel coated with shop primers over which welding or painting can be done safely.|$|E
50|$|Catholic girl Patsy (Donna Corcoran) {{lives in}} an orphanage in Quebec. After the orphanage burns down due to Patsy's accidentally {{knocking}} over a lamp, she finds a new home with the McChesney couple, who live in Protestant Ottawa. While Victoria McChesney (Greer Garson) is excited about the new family member, Patrick McChesney (Walter Pidgeon) reacts reluctantly as he was uninformed of the adoption, and is also {{a candidate for the}} Parliament in Ottawa. After Victoria overcomes a case of mycetism caused by Patsy collecting poisonous mushrooms, Patsy is suspected of causing the <b>flame</b> <b>cleaning</b> of the local school. The examination of the case finds no concrete evidence against Patsy. McChesney declares to give up his candidature in order to accept Patsy as his daughter. Patsy, however, flees. In the meantime, her innocence is proven. Patsy is found again and accepted in the McChesney home as their daughter.|$|E
40|$|Effective {{management}} of heritage assets relies on decision-making which is underpinned by empirical evidence of impact of treatments on long term survival prospects of materials. Historic wrought iron presents {{a particular problem}} for conservation. It occupies a niche position between heritage and engineering, is frequently exposed to outdoor atmospheric corrosion and, {{in the case of}} bridges, gates and similar structures, may be required to perform a distinct function. Sector guidance to direct practices is based on anecdotal evidence and established methods. British Standards relate to modern steels hence application to historic ferrous metals is complicated by differences in metallurgy and lack of concession to conservation ethics. This study generates empirical evidence of the effects of five surface preparation methods and three protective coating systems on the corrosion rate of historic wrought iron samples. Immersion in sodium hydroxide solution and blasting with crushed walnut shells are found to reduce corrosion rates of uncoated wrought iron. Aluminium oxide and glass beads blasting increase corrosion rate but offer removal of contaminants and a keyed surface for coating adhesion. <b>Flame</b> <b>cleaning</b> increases corrosion rate by almost four times the uncleaned wrought iron corrosion rate. A two-pack epoxy resin coating system with polyurethane topcoat applied over substrate surfaces blasted to Sa 2. 5 (near white metal) and a surface tolerant single-pack alkyd coating applied over coherent oxide layers successfully prevented corrosion for almost two years in high static relative humidity environments. An alkyd system applied over Sa 2. 5 blasted surface does not significantly reduce corrosion rate of the uncoated substrate. A cost benefit approach to interpreting the empirical results in relation to practicalities of applying the treatments is advocated. The methods developed for standardising historic sample material and measuring oxygen consumption of coated samples as proxy corrosion rate offer scope for further work in this area. A standardised approach to testing permits correlation of test data between workers in this area to generate a database of empirical data to inform decision-making...|$|E
