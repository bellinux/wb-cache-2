This savage conception of night, as the swallower and <b>disgorger,</b> might start the notion of other swallowing and disgorging beings. Again the Bushmen, and other savage peoples, account for certain celestial phenomena by saying that 'a big star has swallowed his daughter, and spit her out again.' While natural phenomena, explained on savage principles, might give the data of the swallow-myth, we must not conclude that all beings to whom the story is attached are, therefore, the Night. On this principle Cronus would be the Night, and so would the wolf in Grimm. For our purposes it is enough that the feat of Cronus is a feat congenial to the savage fancy and repugnant to the civilised Greeks who found themselves in possession of the myth. Beyond this, and beyond the inference that the Cronus myth was first evolved by people to whom it seemed quite natural, that is, by savages, we do not pretend to go in our interpretation.|$|E
50|$|A <b>disgorger</b> {{is used by}} {{slipping}} the {{end over}} a tight line and sliding down to the bend of the hook. A push is then needed to remove the hook. Under {{the pressure of the}} line, the hook will tighten against the end of the <b>disgorger</b> and can be removed from the mouth.|$|E
50|$|Baits {{for this}} perch include minnows, or lugworms, and ragworms, shrimps, and {{artificial}} lures. The tackle needed is fine but strong. Artificial lures are also effective, {{particularly for the}} medium-sized perch.When fishing with bait, the angler will {{want to have a}} disgorger; perch are notorious for swallowing the hook, and will need aid of a <b>disgorger</b> or forceps for unhooking.|$|E
50|$|A <b>disgorger</b> {{is used in}} coarse fishing {{to remove}} a fish hook from deep inside {{the mouth of a}} fish that is not {{possible}} to reach using fingers alone. It is also known as the Unhooker or Hook remover. It is typically made of plastic or metal and is used on smaller fish. Larger fish that are hooked deep inside the mouth can be unhooked using a pair of forceps or a pair of long-nose pliers.|$|E
50|$|Perch {{are popular}} sport fish species. They {{are known to}} put up a fight, and to be good eating. They can be caught with a variety of methods, {{including}} float fishing, lure fishing and legering. The best way is to use a small hook and cast into the weeds just before the drop off. When fishing with bait, the angler will want to have a disgorger; perch are notorious for swallowing the hook, and will need aid of a <b>disgorger</b> or forceps for unhooking. In many parts of the world, they are also a favourite species among ice fishermen. They will take a variety of baits, including minnows, worms, maggots, goldfish, pieces of raw bacon, prawn, and softshell crayfish, but seem to prefer shrimp (Caridina, Neocaridina, Palaemon), Krill, small fish, lobworms, ragworms, red maggots, and lures. Fly fishing for perch using patterns that imitate small fry or invertebrates can be successful. The record weight for this fish in Britain is 6 lb 3 oz (2.81 kg), and in America 6 lb 4 oz (2.83 kg).|$|E
