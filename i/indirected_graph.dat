In this paper we focus on the Balanced Vertex k-Separator Problem, i. e., the problem of finding a minimum cardinality separator such that the sizes of the resulting disconnected subsets are balanced. We present a compact Integer Linear Programming formulation for the problem, and present a polyhedral study of the associated polytope. We also present an Exponential-Size formulation, for which we derive a column generation and a branching scheme. Preliminary computational results are reported comparing the performance of the two formulations on a set of benchmark instances...|$|E

40|$|We study several bicriteria network design {{problems}} phrased as follows: {{given an}} <b>indirected</b> <b>graph</b> and two minimization objectives {{with a budget}} specified on one objective, find a subgraph satisfying certain connectivity requirements that minimizes the second objective subject to the budget on the first. First, we develop a formalism for bicriteria problems and their approximations. Secondly, we use a simple parametric search technique to provide bicriteria approximation algorithms for problems with two similar criteria, where both criteria are the same measure (such as the diameter or {{the total cost of}} a tree) but differ only in the cost function under which the measure is computed. Thirdly, we present an (O(log n), O(log n)) -approximation algorithm for finding a diameter-constrained minimum cost spanning tree of an undirected graph on n nodes. Finally, for the class of treewidth-bounded graphs, we provide pseudopolynomial-time algorithms for a number of bicriteria problems using dynamic programming. These pseudopolynomial-time algorithms can be converted to fully polynomial-time approximation schemes using a scaling technique...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{address the}} problem of {{designing}} decentralized laws to control a team of general fully actuated manipulators which synchronize their movements while following the same desired trajectory. To this effect we investigate an adaptive control of an identical multiple manipulators, with unknown inertia parameters, tracking a common trajectory. It is also assumed that all the robots in the synchronization system have the same number of joints and equivalent joint work spaces, i. e. any possible configuration of a given robot in the system can be achieved by any other robot in the system. Adaptive controls are derived for group of manipulators using a consensus algorithm. This consensus algorithm is applied on the group level to estimate the time-varying group trajectory information in a distributed manner. The proposed strategy only requires local neighbor-to-neighbor information exchange between manipulators and does not assume the existence of any explicit leaders in the team. The interaction topology of a network of agents is represented using an <b>indirected</b> <b>graph.</b> The coordination strategy is to let each manipulator track its desired trajectory while synchronizing its motion with the others manipulator's motions so that differential position errors amongst robots converge to zero...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAims/ Objectives: A protein-protein {{interaction}} {{network is}} {{considered as a}} simple <b>indirected</b> <b>graph,</b> weighted or non weighted. A partition of the vertex set, into connected, eventually overlapping, clusters having an edge density larger than the whole graph, is searched. Such a cluster is denoted as a module. The cellular functionality of proteins is predicted from this network decomposition. To improve the prediction quality, we need to evaluate the robustness of these modules. Methodology: We propose a new method which consists in: selecting a non deterministic algorithm for graph partitioning into separate clusters (optimizing a modularity criterion); applying this algorithm several times to generate a set of close partitions; calculating a consensus partition from this set. Results: This set of partitions permits to evaluate the robustness of any class as the average percentage of partitions joining any protein pair in this class. This robustness function {{can be applied to}} compare the consensus partition resulting of this procedure to the usually single partition computed from the graph. Then, we develop a simulation protocol selecting random graphs having a more or less strong community structure. We show that the multi-clustering method provides modules closer to the communities which are more robust than those of a single partition. Finally, we present a simple procedure to extend a strict partition into an overlapping class system, making multi assignment for proteins that could be placed equally into several modules, because their contributions to modularity are similar. - See more at: [URL]...|$|E
