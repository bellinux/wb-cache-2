40|$|This work {{addresses}} the information retrieval problem of auto-indexing Arabic documents. Auto-indexing a text document refers to automatically extracting {{words that are}} suitable for building an index for the document. In this paper, we propose an auto-indexing method for Arabic text documents. This method is mainly based on morphological analysis and on a technique for assigning weights to words. The morphological analysis uses a number of grammatical rules to extract stem words that become candidate <b>index</b> <b>words.</b> The weight assignment technique computes weights for these words relative to the container document. The weight is based on how spread is the word in a document and not only on its rate of occurrence. The candidate <b>index</b> <b>words</b> are then sorted in descending order by weight so that information retrievers can select the more important <b>index</b> <b>words.</b> We empirically verify the usefulness of our method using several examples. For these examples, we obtained an average recall of 46 % and an average precision of 64 %PublishedN/...|$|R

The inverted index was comprised of two tables. The first table contained for each <b>word</b> <b>indexed</b> positions pointing to the other table [e.g. (word, index_positions)]. The second table contained sentiment scores for each indexed position [e.g. (index, SentimentScores)]. Thus, sentiment scores could be quickly found based on <b>indexed</b> <b>words</b> of the first table, and indexes of the second table instead of iterating each word in SentiWordNet (1 st version of algorithm). The inverted index was created before execution of an experiment.|$|R

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a semi-automatic system for ground truth generation of video text detection and recognition, which includes English and Chinese text of different orientation. The system has a facility to allow the user for manual correction of the ground truth if the automatic method produces wrong results.

In this computer simulation study, we examined the effects of different assumptions of a fully recurrent connectionist model in accounting for this processing advantage for ambiguous words. We argue that the ambiguity advantage effect can be accounted for by distributed models if (a) the least mean square (LMS) error-correction algorithm rather than the Hebbian algorithm is used in training the network and (b) activation of the units representing the spelling rather than the meaning is used to <b>index</b> <b>word</b> recognition times. An important advantage of computational models is that the underlying assumptions of the model must be explicitly formulated.

40|$|The present thesis {{investigated}} how {{words are}} processed {{within the context}} of visual search. Both explicit and implicit measures were used to assess whether spatial attention is a prerequisite for words to undergo processing. In the explicit search task, subjects searched a display and indicated whether a word was present or absent among nonword distractors. In the implicit task, priming was employed to <b>index</b> <b>word</b> processing. Subjects viewed the same search displays that were used in the explicit task, however, the displays were presented briefly and were followed by a single target letter string to which subjects performed a lexical decision. In Experiments 3 through 6, in which the target was always presented at fixation, no priming was evident. In Experiments 7 and 8 when the location of the target moved from trial to trial, priming was observed. It is argued that attentional resources are narrowly allocated to a location in visual space when target location is certain but diffusely allocated when target location is uncertain. Furthermore, processing only occurs for words that fall within the suffusion of this strategically pliable attentional beam. The results are also interpreted within the domains of perceptual cuing and attentional capture...|$|E
40|$|Individuals {{with autism}} {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) have impaired {{ability to use}} context, which may manifest as alterations of relatedness within the semantic network. However, impairment in context use may {{be more difficult to}} detect in high-functioning adults with ASD. To test context use in this population, we examined the influence of context on memory by using the “false memory” test. In the false memory task, lists of words were presented to high-functioning subjects with ASD and matched controls. Each list consists of words highly related to an <b>index</b> <b>word</b> not on the list. Subjects are then given a recognition test. Positive responses to the index words represent false memories. We found that individuals with ASD are able to discriminate false memory items from true items significantly better than are control subjects. Memory in patients with ASD may be more accurate than in normal individuals under certain conditions. These results also suggest that semantic representations comprise a less distributed network in high-functioning adults with ASD. Furthermore, these results {{may be related to the}} unusually high memory capacities found in some individuals with ASD. Research directed at defining the range of tasks performed superiorly by high-functioning individuals with ASD will be important for optimal vocational rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} origins of {{specific}} letter-colour associations experienced by people with grapheme-colour synaesthesia. We present novel evidence that frequently observed trends in synaesthesia (e. g. A is typically red) can be tied to orthographic associations between letters and words (e. g., “A is for apple”), which are typically formed during literacy acquisition. In our experiments, we first tested members {{of the general population}} to show that certain words are consistently associated with letters of the alphabet (e. g. A is for apple), which we named index words. Sampling from the same population, we then elicited the typical colour associations of these index words (e. g. apples are red) and used the letter → <b>index</b> <b>word</b> → colour connections to predict which colours and letters would be paired together based on these orthographic-semantic influences. We then looked at direct letter-colour associations (e. g., A → red, B → blue…) from both synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes. In both populations, we show statistically that the colour predicted by index words matches significantly with the letter-colour mappings: that is, A → red because A is for apple and apples are prototypically red. We therefore conclude that letter-colour associations in both synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes are tied to early-learned letter-word associations...|$|E

The MSEIP library system is a method for organization and retrieval of resource materials in the Project library.

The KWIC indexing system is a computerized system designed by the International Business Machines Corporation for organizing information by indexing. l KWIC indexing is based upon the theory that a simple way to index information is to use the actual words contained in documents as index terms. This is done by listing the document words in alphabetical order. A refinement over this simple alphabetical listing is to include with each <b>index</b> <b>word</b> those words by which it is surrounded. A further refinement is to exclude, from the index, non-significant words such as prepositions and articles. The KWIC index proper does just that: it excludes words which the program has designated as non-significant, and it lists alphabetically all the remaining words (keywords), with each surrounded by the words which appear with it in the original material. Hence the name, Key-Word-In-Context...|$|E
40|$|Hadoop MapReduce is a {{framework}} for distributed storage and processing of large datasets that is quite popular in big data analytics. It has various configuration parameters (knobs) which {{play an important role}} in deciding the performance i. e., the execution time of a given big data processing job. Default values of these parameters do not always result in good performance and hence it is important to tune them. However, there is inherent difficulty in tuning the parameters due to two important reasons - firstly, the parameter search space is large and secondly, there are cross-parameter interactions. Hence, there is a need for a dimensionality-free method which can automatically tune the configuration parameters by taking into account the cross-parameter dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel Hadoop parameter tuning methodology, based on a noisy gradient algorithm known as the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). The SPSA algorithm tunes the parameters by directly observing the performance of the Hadoop MapReduce system. The approach followed is independent of parameter dimensions and requires only 2 observations per iteration while tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in achieving good performance on popular Hadoop benchmarks namely Grep, Bigram, Inverted <b>Index,</b> <b>Word</b> Co-occurrence and Terasort. Our method, when tested on a 25 node Hadoop cluster shows 66 % decrease in execution time of Hadoop jobs on an average, when compared to the default configuration.

40|$|Abstract — We have {{proposed}} an information filtering system using <b>index</b> <b>word</b> selection from a document set {{based on the}} topics included {{in a set of}} documents. This method narrows down the particularly characteristic words in a document set and the topics are obtained by Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization. In information filtering, a document is often represented with the vector in which the elements correspond to the weight of the index words, and the dimension of the vector becomes larger as the number of documents is increased. Therefore, it is possible that useless words as index words for the information filtering are included. In order to address the problem, the dimension needs to be reduced. Our proposal reduces the dimension by selecting index words based on the topics included in a document set. We have applied the Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization to the document set to obtain these topics. The filtering is carried out based on a centroid of the learning document set. The centroid is regarded as the user’s interest. In addition, the centroid is represented with a document vector whose elements consist of the weight of the selected index words. Using the English test collection MEDLINE, thus, we confirm the effectiveness of our proposal. Hence, our proposed selection can confirm the improvement of the recommendation accuracy from the other previous methods when selecting the appropriate number of index words. In addition, we discussed the selected index words by our proposal and we found our proposal was able to select the index words covered some minor topics included in the document set...|$|E

Applying this method to the compilation of a user dictionary targeting newspaper article sentences and sentences ofsoftware design documents has revealed that the automatically determined SAs include 50 to 80 % of the correct attributes. Translation experiments confirmed that the automatically acquired SAs improved translation quality by 6 - 13 %. 1. Introduct ion When working with a MT(machine translation) system, users compile user dictionaries for the words which are not registered in the system dictionaries or for those with inappropriate ranslations [1]. But when registering new words in a dictionary, {{there is a need}} to give not just the <b>index</b> <b>word</b> and translated word, but also syntactic, semantic and various other information. Systems aiming at higher levels of translation quality require more detailed and accurate information [2, 3], and it is no simple task for laymen to give such information. In particular, semantic information usually requires the skill of professionals. In this paper, attention has been focused on the characteristics of user defined words. A method is proposed where for index words (noun words or compound nouns) in the original language that users eek to register, one need give only the translation i the target language to permit he system apply the knowledge held in the system dictionaries, automatically judge the type of noun and determine the SAs of the word for the noun types. 2.
