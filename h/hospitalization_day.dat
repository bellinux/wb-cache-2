Our study aims to investigate such admission profiles. MethodsFive percent of admission data {{for children under}} 5 years old in 2000 and 2009 was collected from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. We calculated the admission rate in regards to total admission, the patients' gender, the ten leading diagnoses, the ten most systemic common categories of disease, and the average <b>hospitalization</b> <b>days</b> and costs. The differences of the rates between 2000 and 2009 were evaluated by incidence rate ratios (IRR). ResultsThe admission rate per thousand children (population) was higher in 2009 (172. 9) than 2000 (153. 1). The ten most common systemic categories of disease were similar in both years. Furthermore, {{it was observed that}} the <b>hospitalization</b> <b>days</b> decreased by 3. 7 % in 2009, while medical expenditures increased by 10. 9 %.

Her ferritin level peaked on day 2 of <b>hospitalization</b> (<b>day</b> 7 of illness) at 13, 670.00  µg/mL and decreased thereafter (Fig.  1 d). Soluble haptoglobin, CD 163 and CD 25 determined using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Genway, San Diego; R&D System, Minneapolis) showed a very low level of haptoglobin (0.05  g/L) compared to healthy donor group with mean value of 228.49  g/L (data not shown).

Methods: Patients with ITP diagnosed at the Hematology Clinic, School of Medicine, Cumhuriyet University, Sivas, Turkey between January 2005 and December 2011 were evaluated by a retrospective review of our patients’ records. Eighty-one patients with ITP were collected. The first relapse was termed as the <b>hospitalization</b> <b>day</b> before second-line therapy, and the second relapse was termed as the <b>hospitalization</b> <b>day</b> before alternate second-line therapy. We provided the following data of ITP patients at diagnosis, before and after first relapses, and before and after second relapses: presenting symptoms, platelet count, MPV, PDW, and PCT values. Results: We obtained significant statistical differences between MPV values after initial treatment and before second-line therapy (first relapse) (p = 0. 005), between MPV values after splenectomy and before immunosuppressive or immune modulator therapy (second relapse) (p = 0. 028), and also, between PCT values after splenectomy and before second relapse (p = 0. 043). Conclusion: Mean platelet volume is gradually increasing before first and second relapses, and again normal values are being obtained after appropriate therapies.

40|$|Reactive {{thrombocytosis}} (RT) in pediatric {{patients is}} common, but usually without symptoms. The incidence of RT is different depending on age. Mostly, we reason that RT is a phenomenon, nevertheless the diagnostic value of RT is little known. Therefore, {{the aim of}} this study was to determine the association of RT and clinical or laboratory characteristics in pediatric diseases. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of pediatric patients hospitalized at Wan Fang hospital from January 2002 to July 2009. Thrombocytosis was defined as a platelet count more than 500 × 109 /L. There were 822 patients enrolled to this study. The clinical parameters, including age, gender, disease type, and <b>hospitalization</b> <b>days,</b> were investigated. The association between RT and clinical manifestations and the relationship of leukocytes, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and platelet counts were analyzed. Results: The overall incidence of RT in hospitalized pediatric patients was 6. 3 %. Infants had a significantly higher incidence (11. 3 %, p< 0. 001). Mild RT was found in most patients (83. 6 %). Infections (75. 4 %) were the most common cause, followed by perinatal diseases (11. 1 %). The relationship of RT and age revealed a positive correlation (p= 0. 045, r= 0. 70 after adjustment). The degree of RT was an independent factor for <b>hospitalization</b> <b>days</b> (p< 0. 001, r= 0. 126 after adjustment). There was a positive correlation between white blood cell count and platelets (p= 0. 002, r= 0. 017); on the contrary, the relationship between hemoglobin level and platelets was an inverse correlation (p< 0. 001, r=− 0. 193). Conclusions: In children, the degree of RT was associated with age, and patients had significantly longer <b>hospitalization</b> <b>days</b> in proportion to the increase in platelet count. Laboratory association revealed that the degree of RT was positively correlated to white cell count and negatively correlated to hemoglobin level. Therefore, the degree of RT might be a predictive factor with regard to <b>hospitalization</b> <b>days</b> in pediatric diseases...|$|R
40|$|Background. Cardiorenal {{syndrome}} type 2 (CRS- 2) {{is common}} in end-stage chronic heart failure (CHF). Peritoneal ultrafiltration (pUF) may entail clinical functional improvement {{and a reduction in}} hospitalizations. Methods. Thirty-nine consecutive end-stage CHF patients with stable CRS- 2 were initiated on am-bulatory pUF after interdisciplinary cardiological/nephrological evaluation and prospectively fol-lowed for 1 year. All-cause hospitalization was the primary end point. Secondary end points included mortality, treatment alteration and change in weight, NYHA functional class or quality of life (QoL). Outcomes were compared both within the pUF cohort (365 prior to initiation) and with 39 matched CHF patients receiving standard medical treatment. Results. Compared with pretreatment, there was a trend to a reduction in 1 -year <b>hospitalization</b> <b>days</b> in the pUF group (P = 0. 07). One-year mortality was 33 % in the pUF group and 23 % in the matched control cohort. pUF was stopped in eight patients (18 %) due to recurrent peritonitis (n = 3), insufficient ultrafiltration (n = 3) or cardiac recompensation (n = 1). Compared with standard medical treatment, pUF significantly improved volume overload (P < 0. 05), NYHA functional class (P < 0. 001) and mental health (P < 0. 05). Moreover, <b>hospitalization</b> <b>days</b> for all causes as well as cardiovascular <b>hospitalization</b> <b>days</b> were significantly reduced during the interim periods in the pUF group (P < 0. 05 and P < 0. 001, respectively).

Randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the effects of pUF on hospitalization and mortality in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Cost sharing has {{traditionally}} been invoked to fight the moral hazard associated with full health care insurance (be it public or private).

Pneumococcal endocarditis coexisting with meningitis is rare, especially in healthy individuals. A 66 -year-old woman was admitted with pneumococcal bacteremia, meningitis, and arthritis. She was in good condition before admission. Because of typical presentation of bacterial meningitis characteristics and normal echocardiographic findings, the patient was administered antibiotics for meningitis and arthritis. On <b>hospitalization</b> <b>day</b> 59, she developed a fever, and echocardiography showed severe aortic regurgitation, perforation, and vegetation of the aortic valve.

40|$|AbstractPurposeCompared with warfarin, the new target-specific oral {{anticoagulant}} agents may have advantages, such as shorter hospital length of stay, {{in patients with}} nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The objective {{of the present study}} was to assess, among patients with NVAF, the effects of rivaroxaban versus warfarin on the number of <b>hospitalization</b> <b>days</b> and other health care resource utilization in a cohort of rivaroxaban users and matched warfarin users. MethodsData from health care claims dated from May 2011 to December 2012 from the Humana database were analyzed. Adult patients newly initiated on treatment with rivaroxaban or warfarin, with ≥ 2 diagnoses of AF (ICD- 9 -CM code 427. 31), and without valvular AF were identified. Based on propensity score methods, warfarin recipients were matched 1 : 1 to rivaroxaban recipients. The end of the observation period was defined as the end of data availability, the end of insurance coverage, death, the date of a switch to another anticoagulant agent, or day 14 of treatment nonpersistence. The total number of <b>hospitalization</b> <b>days</b> and other health care resource utilization parameters (numbers of hospitalizations, emergency department [ED] visits, and outpatient visits) were evaluated using the method by Lin et al. FindingsMatches for all rivaroxaban recipients were found, and the characteristics of the matched groups (n = 2253 per group) were well balanced. The mean age of both cohorts was 74 years; 46 % were female. The estimated mean total numbers of <b>hospitalization</b> <b>days</b> were significantly less in rivaroxaban users compared with those in warfarin users (all-cause, 2. 71 vs 3. 87 days [P = 0. 032]; AF-related, 2. 11 vs 3. 02 days [P = 0. 014]). The numbers of outpatient visits were also significantly less (all-cause, 25. 26 vs 35. 79 visits [P < 0. 001]; AF-related, 5. 48 vs 9. 06 visits [P < 0. 001]). Rivaroxaban users had a lesser estimated mean number of all-cause hospitalizations compared with warfarin users (0. 55 vs 0. 73; P = 0. 084), and a significantly lesser estimated mean number of AF-related hospitalizations (0. 40 vs 0. 57; P = 0. 022).

The patient then developed a ventricular fibrillation (VF) as the ST segment had began to decrease. A direct current shock was used immediately and the VF resolved. A significant stenosis of coronary artery was not present on the coronary angiography. The arrhythmia during the decrease in the ST segment may be explained as a so-called reperfusion arrhythmia. Thus, prevention of coronary spasm by calcium antagonists and/or long-acting nitrates appears important...|$|E
30|$|A 54 -year-old {{man who had}} had {{postprandial}} {{pain for}} 6  months was admitted to our hospital because of vomiting and diarrhea. Although the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries were occluded at the proximal portion, contrast enhancement of the bowel wall was good in contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). Endoscopic examination revealed only a healed gastric ulcer and slight mucosal erosions in the colon. He was diagnosed as having acute enteritis or inflammatory digestive disease and observed with conservative therapy, which improved his acute symptoms. On <b>hospitalization</b> <b>day</b> 42, he suddenly complained of lower back pain. CECT showed abdominal free air, which indicated gastrointestinal perforation. Emergency surgery was performed for jejunum resection. Two days later, a second operation was performed for a leak in the anastomotic site of the jejunum. Necrotic change in the small intestinal serosa was also observed and required broad resection of the small intestine. He was diagnosed with acute exacerbation of CMI, and we performed surgical retrograde bypass to the gastroduodenal artery using a saphenous vein graft as the third operation. After the surgery, he was free from digestive symptoms and was discharged.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{relationships between}} the incidence of re-detachment and post-operative days of hospitalization in patients with diagnosis of retinal detachment (RD) who underwent surgery either through ab-externo approach (scleral buckling and encir-cling) or ab-interno approach (vitrectomy and oil-gas tamponade). Methods. This retrospective study included 268 patients (268 eyes) with diagnosis of primary RD: 127 males (47 %) and 141 (53 %) females, mean age of 64. 1 ± 17. 3 years. 46 patients (17 %) underwent a surgical ab-externo approach (group A), while 222 patients (83 %) underwent an ab-interno surgical approach. Each RD was graded according to the “Retinal detachment grading system of Royal College of Ophthalmologists ” and treated within 5 days after diagnosis. The redetachment (RT) related to a surgical failure was considered within 30 days after first operation. Results. In the group 1 without night <b>hospitalization</b> (<b>day</b> surgery) global RT rate was 3. 5 % (4. 17 % for ab-interno technique and 0 % for ab-externo techniques). In the group 2 with one day of hospitalization global RT rate was 1. 33 % (1. 49 % for ab-interno tech...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) {{increase}} {{mortality and}} morbidity risks for affected infants especially in less developed countries. This study aimed at assessing {{the effects of}} systematic pediatric care on neonatal mortality and hospitalizations of infants with cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) in South America. Methods The intervention group included live-born infants with isolated or associated CL/P in 47 hospitals between 2003 and 2005. The control group included live-born infants with CL/P between 2001 and 2002 in the same hospitals. The intervention group received systematic pediatric care between the 7 th and 28 th day of life. The primary outcomes were mortality between the 7 th and 28 th day of life and <b>hospitalization</b> <b>days</b> in this period among survivors adjusted for relevant baseline covariates. Results There were no significant mortality differences between the intervention and control groups. However, surviving infants with associated CL/P in the intervention group had fewer <b>hospitalization</b> <b>days</b> by about six days compared to the associated control group. Conclusions Early systematic pediatric care may significantly reduce neonatal hospitalizations of infants with CL/P and additional birth defects in South America. Given the large healthcare and financial burden of CL/P on affected families and the relatively low cost of systematic pediatric care, improving access to such care may be a cost-effective public policy intervention.
