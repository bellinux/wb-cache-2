60|$|Domiloff raised <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. His {{expression}} was inscrutable.|$|E
60|$|Master Maloney raised <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment from}} his book as Psmith re-entered the office.|$|E
60|$|He leant forward, {{and pressed}} his hands upon <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> long time he said nothing.|$|E
60|$|He {{bent down}} and made a closer examination, and as he did this Henry gave a deep shudder and opened <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant.|$|R
6000|$|... "I must escape," [...] he thought, {{and with}} a moan, as if in great pain, he twisted around, and opened <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Fenwick, I wouldn't dare {{to stand}} before <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute. The {{sound of his voice}} would kill me straight. How could I go back?" ...|$|R
60|$|Gartok closed <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few seconds, {{but did not}} speak. Then {{he looked}} up again earnestly.|$|E
60|$|Jack closed <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{minute and}} then gave the correct answer to five places of decimals.|$|E
60|$|Sir Andrew hid <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment with}} his hand, {{then let it}} fall and spoke in a changed voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pull him back, {{before he}} has a chance to slip," [...] ordered Chet, and this Andy did. The {{movement}} made the man groan, and presently he opened <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant.|$|R
6000|$|She met <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{second and}} her heart failed her. The truth was impossible, indecent. If she {{mentioned}} Ramage {{he might have a}} fit--anything might happen. She lied. [...] "The Widgetts," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|... "What luck! What stupendous and {{imperial}} luck!" [...] said Dick. [...] "It's 'just before the battle, mother.' Oh, God {{has been most}} good to me! Only"--the agony of the thought made him screw up <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant--"Maisie [...] ." ...|$|R
60|$|The lawyer {{gripped the}} bundle hard in one hand, closed <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, opened them again {{and struck out}} boldly.|$|E
60|$|Fischer was {{watching}} his glass being filled with champagne. He seized {{it by the}} stem. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment travelled upwards.|$|E
60|$|She drew {{a little}} further away from him, as though {{something}} which had flamed in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment had frightened her.|$|E
60|$|As {{they did}} so, Captain Dall put his {{telescope}} to <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, wishing to scan closely {{the features of}} the chief. Instantly the whole band turned with a howl, and, making towards the canoe, jumped in and pushed off.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Sarpent must be thereabouts," [...] {{observed}} Pathfinder, {{who never}} turned <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant {{from the young}} warrior; [...] "and yet he must be strangely off his guard to allow a Mingo devil to get his stand so near, with manifest signs of bloodshed in his heart." ...|$|R
60|$|He looked round {{his studio}} wearily; {{he had loved}} it because her {{presence}} had made it gay and homelike; he shut <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant; then {{he gave her a}} long look as though to impress on his mind the picture of her. He got up and took his hat.|$|R
6000|$|I feel sure {{now that}} there was pity in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, though I {{scarcely}} noticed it then, and he answered gravely: ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Goodwood fixed <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment on}} the floor; then at last, raising them, [...] "Does she know Mr. Osmond?" [...] he enquired.|$|E
60|$|The young savage smiled {{intelligently}} {{and spoke}} to Powlet, who thereupon turned to Biarne, and, rolling <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few seconds, uttered a low wail.|$|E
60|$|He knit his brows, {{and fixed}} <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant on the ground; as he raised them, the folding {{doors at the}} bottom of the hall were cast wide, and, preceded by the major-domo with his wand, and four domestics bearing blazing torches, the guests of the evening entered the apartment.|$|R
60|$|The Professor smiled acquiescently. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> rested <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment {{upon her}} necklace.|$|R
60|$|Stretched upon a {{mattress}} on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep. Towards him the old man sometimes directed <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, and then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long-burnt wick drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table, plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere.|$|R
6000|$|... "Young Clewer {{would give}} <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{place to be}} quiet in. I know that," [...] said Beetle. [...] "If we made him a study-fag, eh?" ...|$|E
60|$|Nikasti {{scrambled}} to his feet. There were livid marks under <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> moment {{he had lost}} all his vitality, {{he was like a}} beaten creature.|$|E
60|$|He starts up; <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment dulled by sleep, lighten with {{pleasure}} {{as he sees}} his dear George. He puts his arm round his brother with a boyish laugh.|$|E
60|$|Over {{the moonlit}} wave the gondola swiftly skimmed! The scene was a marvellous {{contrast}} to the one which the stranger had just quitted; but it brought no serenity to his careworn countenance, though <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment kindled as he looked upon the moon, that was sailing in the cloudless heaven with a single star by her side.|$|R
60|$|Rollo turned <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment {{towards the}} mountain. All {{the lower part}} of it was of a cold and deathlike whiteness, while the tip of the summit was glowing {{as if it had been}} on fire. He was, however, too much {{interested}} in the smoke of the gun to look long at the mountain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{to be sure}} not, boy, we are as old a {{house as}} there is in the kingdom, and as noble too; but the admiral has queer notions, and, perhaps, he has some cub of <b>a</b> sailor in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> son-in-law. Be prudent, my boy, be prudent; that is all I ask of you." ...|$|R
60|$|As he {{said these}} words, he fixed <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment sadly and earnestly on my face, then looked away, leaned his cheek on his hand, and spoke no more.|$|E
60|$|BENNET [very quietly he turns, lets <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment meet Fanny's. Then answers as {{he crosses}} to the windows]. The last I heard about her {{was that she was}} married.|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I didn't {{love the}} man I was engaged to," [...] she said. She met <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, {{and could not}} {{interpret}} their expression. They struck her as cold and indifferent.|$|E
60|$|Dick was {{now more}} alarmed than ever. He carried {{his brother to}} the dining room, and laid him on some chairs, with a doubled-up blanket from <b>a</b> bed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pillow. He washed Tom's head and bound it up as best he could. Once or twice the injured youth opened <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, {{but he did not}} make a sound.|$|R
50|$|Benyon {{became an}} {{important}} first team player by 2009-10 and his 15 goals in all competitions helped Torquay survive a difficult first season back in the league. He then scored 14 goals for {{the middle of the}} 2010-11 season, attracting the interest of several clubs with not only <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> goal but also his work-rate in chasing and harrying defenders.|$|R
60|$|But {{the room}} was deserted. Tommy walked across to the writing-table, and opened the middle drawer. A photograph, {{carelessly}} thrust in face upwards, caught <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> moment he stood rooted to the ground. Then he took it out, shut the drawer, walked slowly over to an arm-chair, and sat down still staring at the photograph in his hand.|$|R
