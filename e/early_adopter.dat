5|$|Early {{use of the}} NS-10 among {{engineers}} include Bob Clearmountain, Rhett Davies, and Bill Scheniman in the US, and Nigel Jopson in the UK. Clearmountain, then {{a rising}} star in record production, is often credited for {{the popularity of the}} NS-10; Phil Ward, writing in Sound on Sound, suggested that Clearmountain was probably not the earliest, but was certainly the most influential <b>early</b> <b>adopter.</b> It became a legend that Clearmountain had chosen it because it was the worst speaker he could find. He was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones, and a pair of Yamaha NS-10, as a reference.|$|E

In 1972 the International Court of Justice in a case launched by Australia and New Zealand, and advocated by Dr Helen Caldicott, ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll. In 1973 Australia's concerns {{saw it as a}} champion and an <b>early</b> <b>adopter</b> of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and around this time, the Government ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty. Shortly after this, the Government negotiated with the International Atomic Energy Agency to put in safeguards to ensure Australia could mine and export nuclear material but not breach the intent of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.|$|E

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} find out whether there are {{systematic}} differences between <b>early</b> <b>adopters</b> and a matched control group of non <b>early</b> <b>adopters</b> of FRS 114 (Segment Reporting) based on the following company characteristics: (1) firm size, (2) board characteristics, (3) leverage, (4) audit firm size, and (5) firm growth rate. Using a sample of 32 <b>early</b> <b>adopters</b> and without differentiating whether they disclose the required segment information in full or partially and a control group of 32 non <b>early</b> <b>adopters,</b> our findings indicate company with higher proportion of non executive directors, particularly non independent non executives, is more likely to adopt FRS 114 before the effective date. When <b>early</b> <b>adopters</b> are further classified into full or partial adopters, the result shows that full <b>early</b> <b>adopters</b> are significantly larger (in terms of total assets) than non <b>early</b> <b>adopters.</b> However, when comparing between partial <b>early</b> <b>adopters</b> and non <b>early</b> <b>adopters,</b> the evidence suggests that partial <b>early</b> <b>adopters</b> are significantly smaller in size than non <b>early</b> <b>adopters.</b> We find no evidence to indicate that there are significant differences between full <b>early</b> <b>adopters,</b> partial <b>early</b> <b>adopters</b> and non <b>early</b> <b>adopters</b> in terms of board size, board leadership, independent directors, audit firm size, leverage and firm growth rate...|$|R

Due to significant differences for most of the important characteristics of <b>early</b> <b>adopters</b> (see Section 2), female <b>early</b> <b>adopters</b> are expected to show significant differences for these characteristics as well.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} female <b>early</b> <b>adopters</b> of carsharing and e-carsharing, a German sample of 492 carsharing subscribers from Berlin is analysed of which 74 are female <b>early</b> <b>adopters.</b> This sample generally confirms socio-demographic findings about <b>early</b> <b>adopters</b> as described before. The presentation of the results is structured according to the identified characteristics in Section 2.

First, the results of analysing socio-demographic backgrounds are being presented. Second, preferences in mode choice including a section about the use and evaluation of the e-carsharing service are described.

25|$|The first {{electrical}} {{hearing aid}} used the carbon microphone {{of the telephone}} and was introduced in 1896. The vacuum tube made electronic amplification possible, but early versions of amplified hearing aids were too heavy to carry around.

The transistor invented in 1948 was well suited to the hearing aid application due to low power and small size; hearing aids were an <b>early</b> <b>adopter</b> of transistors. The development of integrated circuits allowed further improvement of the capabilities of wearable aids, including implementation of digital signal processing techniques and programmability for the individual user's needs.|$|E
