500|$|In a {{motel room}} in Roswell, New Mexico, Mulder and Scully prepare for bed and talk. Mulder {{explains}} his belief [...] "that the dead are not lost to us. That they speak to us as part of something greater than us—greater than any alien force. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I are powerless now, I {{want to believe that}} if we listen to what's speaking, it can give us the power to save ourselves." [...] Despite their slim chance for success, Mulder declares, [...] "Maybe there's hope." ...|$|E
500|$|The Dreamcast version's control {{responsiveness}} {{was praised}} by Gantayat. Guilty Gear Xs PS2 version was also generally praised, with Greg Kasavin of GameSpot writing that it [...] "controls smoothly and precisely". Major Mike of GamePro included the caveat that [...] "some moves {{are difficult to}} execute and require patience to master fully." [...] According to James Fudge for GameSpy, [...] "The gameplay manages {{to be easy to}} pick up but isn't dumbed down enough to annoy expert fight fans." [...] Guilty Gear Xs limited replay value was heavily criticised; Jay Fitzloff of Game Informer said, [...] "Since it's especially weak in the singles game, consider purchasing Guilty Gear X only <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> a friend want to go at it." ...|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, Tessa {{demonstrates}} great courage, {{for example}} in [...] "", where she is abducted by three mountain men led by Immortal Caleb Cole, who wants to marry her. Tessa refuses to submit and spreads doubt among them, resulting in Cole finally killing {{one of his own}} men before MacLeod rescues her. Reviewer Rob Lineberger of DVDVerdict.com commented that [...] "...this episode shows the tough stuff Tessa is made of." [...] Tessa is a very selfless character, although it has, occasionally, been known to put her into rather sticky situations, for example, in the episode [...] "See No Evil", Tessa's friend, Natalie, is attacked by serial killer Michael Tanovsky and Tessa uses herself as bait: [...] "Nobody's watching over his next victim, Duncan... and she's going to die <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I don't stop him." [...] Lineberger commented that [...] ", Tessa gets a taste for how Duncan's life must feel when she faces the killer." [...] She hits Tanovsky with her car, telling MacLeod [...] "I thought ridding the world of evil would feel better than this." [...] Panzer comments that having Tessa stop the killer [...] "...was kind of an unusual idea , and this {{was the subject of a}} lot of meetings with [...] David Abramowitz, myself and the people from the various networks, domestic and foreign, who were involved." [...] Tessa has a reputation for speaking frankly and for refusing to tolerate any nonsense. In [...] "", when MacLeod refuses to take her where an evil Immortal is, she says, [...] "I know why you don't want me there. You're afraid that what happened to Lucas [...] could happen to you." [...] Tessa has no self-pity and [...] "...doesn't like euphemisms". For example, in [...] "For Tomorrow We Die", MacLeod calls her [...] "contrary by nature" [...] Tessa parks her car without regard to interdictions, can drive a speedboat, is a poor chess player and dislikes war.|$|E

2500|$|Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, {{a recent}} recruit of the anti-Syrian opposition, emboldened by popular anger and civic action now being called Lebanon's Cedar Revolution, alleged {{in the wake}} of the {{assassination}} that on 26 August 2004 Syrian President Bashar al-Assad threatened Hariri, saying [...] " [...] Lahoud is me. ... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Chirac want me out of Lebanon, I will break Lebanon."

[...] We feel certain that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> the other protesters had been acquainted with all of the facts in the situation, you would not have filed your protest. [...] On the contrary, it is believed that you would have urged the Government to locate the project in your township.

2500|$|Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, {{a recent}} {{adherent}} to the anti-Syrian opposition, emboldened by popular anger and civic action, alleged {{in the wake of}} the assassination that in August 2004 Syrian President Bashar al-Assad threatened Hariri, saying [...] " [...] Lahoud is me. ... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Chirac want me out of Lebanon, I will break Lebanon." [...] He was quoted as saying [...] "When I heard him telling us those words, I knew that it was his condemnation of death." [...] The United States, the EU and the UN have stopped short of any accusations, choosing instead to demand a Syrian pullout from Lebanon and an open and international investigation of the Assassination. Jumblatt's comments are not without controversy; the BBC describes him as [...] "being seen by many as the country's political weathervane" [...] - consistently changing allegiances to emerge on the winning side of the issues de jour through the turmoil of the 1975-90 civil war and its troubled aftermath. He was a supporter of Syria after the war but switched sides after the death of former Syrian president Hafez al-Assad in 2000. His account is quoted, but not confirmed, in the UN's FitzGerald Report. The report stops short of directly accusing Damascus or any other party, saying that only a further thorough international inquest can identify the culprit. The Lebanese government has agreed to this inquiry, though calling for the full participation, not supremacy, of its own agencies and the respect of Lebanese sovereignty. (See international reaction below.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Anthony Nutting {{recalled}} that Eden told him, [...] "What's all this nonsense about isolating Nasser or 'neutralising' him {{as you call}} it? I want him destroyed, can't you understand? I want him murdered, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> the Foreign Office don't agree, then you'd better come to the cabinet and explain why." [...] When Nutting pointed out {{that they had no}} alternative government to replace Nasser, Eden apparently replied, [...] "I don't give a damn if there's anarchy and chaos in Egypt." [...] At a private meeting at Downing Street on 16 October 1956 Eden showed several ministers a plan, submitted two days earlier by the French. Israel would invade Egypt, Britain and France would give an ultimatum telling both sides to stop and, when one refused, send in forces to enforce the ultimatum, separate the two sides – and occupy the Canal and get rid of Nasser. When Nutting suggested the Americans should be consulted Eden replied, [...] "I will not bring the Americans into this ... Dulles has done enough damage as it is. This {{has nothing to do with}} the Americans. We and the French must decide what to do and we alone." [...] Eden openly admitted his view of the crisis was shaped by his experiences in the two world wars, writing, [...] "We are all marked to some extent by the stamp of our generation, mine is that of the assassination in Sarajevo and all that flowed from it. It is impossible to read the record now and not feel that we had a responsibility for always being a lap behind ... Always a lap behind, a fatal lap." ...|$|E
