50|$|Afghanistan, under Taliban {{religious}} leadership, {{has been}} characterized by feminist groups and others as a system of gender apartheid in which women were segregated from men in public and could not enjoy legal freedoms or equal access to employment or education. Rising to power in late 1996, the Taliban accrued international attention for its treatment of women, enacting policies that limited women’s <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> movement, <b>employment,</b> and education rights. Under Taliban rule, women were at risk for detainment and physical abuse if found guilty for violating the imposed dress code, with violations that included: exposure of the hands, wrist, feet, or face; not wearing a burqa; and wearing items perceived to be offensive, e.g. white socks/shoes, stylish clothing, shoes that make noise while walking.|$|R
50|$|Since 1992, {{much of his}} {{judicial}} {{work was}} focused on advancing and shaping Israel's Constitutional Revolution (a phrase which he coined), which he believed was {{brought about by the}} adoption of Basic Laws in the Israeli Knesset dealing with human rights. According to Barak's approach, which was adopted by the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Revolution brought values such as the Right to Equality, <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Employment</b> and Freedom of Speech to a position of normative supremacy, and thereby granted the courts (not just the Supreme Court) the ability to strike down legislation which is inconsistent with the rights embodied in the Basic Laws. Consequently, Barak held that the State of Israel has been transformed from a parliamentary democracy to a constitutional parliamentary democracy, in that its Basic Laws were to be interpreted as its constitution.|$|E
50|$|Job sprawl {{is another}} land use symptom of urban sprawl and car-dependent communities. It {{is defined as}} low-density, {{geographically}} spread-out patterns of employment, {{where the majority of}} jobs in a given metropolitan area are located outside of the main city's central business district (CBD), and increasingly in the suburban periphery. It is often the result of urban disinvestment, the geographic <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> location allowed by predominantly car-dependent commuting patterns of many American suburbs, and many companies' desire to locate in low-density areas that are often more affordable and offer potential for expansion. Spatial mismatch is related to job sprawl and economic environmental justice. Spatial mismatch is defined as the situation where poor urban, predominantly minority citizens are left without easy access to entry-level jobs, as a result of increasing job sprawl and limited transportation options to facilitate a reverse commute to the suburbs.|$|E
40|$|In an {{era when}} {{globalization}} has supposedly challenged {{the ability of the}} nation state to manage economic affairs, I shall argue that the state not only still matters but that it also {{plays a major role in}} processes of labour market stratification for migrant workers. Using the organizing concepts of commodification and de-commodification I review the growing comparative literature on government policies for economic migration to show how skill-based admissions policies, restrictions on <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> as well as differential access to social rights and citizenship generate durable forms of categorical inequality. What is perhaps unique about economic immigration is that these inequalities are underpinned by legislation and, in the case of the highly skilled, requirements for formal certification. The paper concludes by calling for further research within this rapidly growing field to explain how these complex patterns of inequality have emerged and whether they extend beyond the small number of cases that have been examined repeatedly in the existing literature...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the nature}} of the {{contract}} <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> is explored from an ethical point of view. It is argued that certain normative arguments should be taken into account in order to justify such a contract. Furthermore, an argument is developed against the claim that (a) the individual’s <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> decision and (b) the practice of institutional arrangements are sufficient to justify a contract <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> The dimensional analysis offered shows that further conditions are needed: (a) must be elaborated and interpreted to the extent that this condition is not sufficient – rather sub-criteria regarding the agent’s state of knowledge must be met; and (b) should be supplemented by a demand for fairness. A tentative analysis of existing work contracts is the starting point for the ethical analysis. The aim is to show what a legitimate, or reasonable, contract <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> will require. Finally, some important normative implications and consequences regarding the contract’s normative status are discussed.

It {{is used in}} labour law and this contract sets rights and obligations between employer and employee (worker). These rights and obligation are mediated between two parties, which are in equal position.

Employment in Czech republic can also be created by nomination, but this type is exceptional. Both employment contract and nomination are set in Act No. 262 / 2006 Coll., labour code.
