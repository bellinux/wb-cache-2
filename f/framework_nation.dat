40|$|In {{reaction}} to the Ukraine crisis, NATO allies decided at the September 2014 Summit in Wales on the most fundamental military adaptation of the Alliance {{since the end of}} the Cold War. The objective is a large scale reinforcement and reorganisation of defence capabilities. Collective defence has thereby been reinstated as the core task of NATO, requiring considerable political, military and financial input from all Allies. The focus of attention is, however, on Germany. First, Germany played a considerable part in shaping the Wales decisions. Second, the partners expect Germany to bear a substantial military and financial burden because of its economic strength. Third, Berlin placed itself under pressure to promote defence cooperation when it launched the <b>framework</b> <b>nation</b> concept in 2013. (Autorenreferat...|$|E
40|$|The {{transformation}} of the Swedish Defence has substantially changed and increased the demands on the communication systems needed to support its future missions. Sweden’s focus on international missions and most recently, its role as <b>framework</b> <b>nation</b> for the Nordic Battle group, further emphasize this. Demands for interoperability, rapid response, unknown mission areas and heterogeneous operating environments make the assessment of communications systems increasingly hard and complex. Our conclusion is that our traditional methods no longer are satisfactory. The COAT project aims to develop a user-centric, well-structured and traceable methodology {{for the assessment of}} communications systems. The development is focused on capabilities related to the technical parameters of the communications system, but the goal is to provide a method to express how these contribute to higher-level C 2 capabilities and, ultimately, to tactical effects. The methodology should, ideally, be applicable at any point in the life cycle of communications systems, from the study of evolving technologies, R&D, acquisition, operational use, to replacement and decommissioning. This paper will discuss the ideas behind the project, our methodological approach and some thoughts on the assessment of complex systems. 3 1...|$|E
