5|$|Opportunistic {{and highly}} adaptable, the western jackdaw varies its diet {{markedly}} depending on available food sources. They {{have been recorded}} taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the skylark (Alauda arvensis), Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), razorbill (Alca torda), common murre (Uria aalge), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), rock pigeon (Columba livia), and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>collared</b> <b>dove</b> (Streptopelia decaocto). A field study of a large city dump {{on the outskirts of}} León in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk, and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism. The saker falcon (Falco cherrug) has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in Vojvodina in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>collared</b> <b>dove</b> has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, restricted distributions; this is most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove is restricted to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove is restricted to Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove is restricted to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon is restricted to a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove is restricted to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|E

5000|$|In 1974, {{fewer than}} 50 <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Collared</b> <b>Doves</b> escaped captivity in Nassau, New Providence, Bahamas. [...] From the Bahamas, the species spread to Florida, {{and is now}} found in nearly {{every state in the}} US, as well as in Mexico. [...] In Arkansas (United States), the species was {{recorded}} first in 1989 and since then has grown in numbers and is now present in 42 of 75 counties in the state. It spread from the southeast corner of the state in 1997 to the northwest corner in 5 years, covering a distance of about 500 km at a rate of 100 km per year. This is more than double the rate of 45 km per year observed in Europe. [...] Interestingly, as of 2012, few negative impacts have been demonstrated in Florida, where the species is most prolific. [...] However, the species is known as an aggressive competitor, and there is concern that as populations continue to grow, native birds will be outcompeted by the invaders. However, one study found that <b>Eurasian</b> <b>collared</b> <b>doves</b> are not more aggressive or competitive than native mourning doves, despite similar dietary preferences.|$|R

40|$|Background: Wildlife is an {{important}} natural reservoir of many tick-borne pathogens. These agents {{have an impact on}} the health of humans and other animals throughout the world. This study was conducted to determine whether and what species of tick-borne agents had infected wild birds collected from Guangxi, in southwest China. Findings: Liver samples obtained from wild birds were tested for the presence of tick-borne pathogens by PCR assays and sequencing of the flagellin and 16 S rRNA genes. Borrelia garinii was detected in <b>Eurasian</b> <b>collared</b> <b>doves</b> (2 / 57, 3. 5 %) from among the 95 wild birds. Anaplasma phagocytophilum was detected in <b>Eurasian</b> <b>collared</b> <b>doves</b> (2 / 57, 3. 5 %) and Eurasian eagle owls (2 / 13, 15. 4 %). Ehrlichia chaffeensis and a potential novel Anaplasma sp. were identified in Common pheasant (1 / 12, 8. 3 %). These results suggest the involvement of birds in the cycle of tick-borne diseases. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document infection of birds with B. garinii, A. phagocytophilum, E. chaffeensis and the novel Anaplasma sp. in China. Conclusions: Tick-borne zoonotic bacteria B. garinii, A. phagocytophilum and E. chaffeensis, and a potential novel Anaplasma sp., were identified in wild birds in southwest China. The presence of these agents in birds increases the potential spread over long distances and the risk of transmission of infection from birds to new hosts, including humans...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Collared</b> <b>doves</b> {{typically}} breed {{close to}} human habitation wherever food resources are abundant {{and there are}} trees for nesting; almost all nests are within 1 km of inhabited buildings. The female lays two white eggs in a stick nest, which she incubates during the night and which the male incubates during the day. Incubation lasts between 14 and 18 days, with the young fledging after 15 to 19 days. Breeding occurs throughout the year when abundant food is available, though only rarely in winter in areas with cold winters such as northeastern Europe. Three to four broods per year is common, although up to six broods in a year has been recorded. [...] <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Collared</b> <b>Doves</b> are a monogamous species, and share parental duties when caring for young.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{factors related}} to the range {{expansion}} trajectory of a successful invasive species may provide insights into environmental variables that favour additional expan-sion or guide monitoring and survey efforts for this and other invasive species. We exam-ined the relationship of presence and abundance of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Collared</b> <b>Doves</b> Streptopelia decaocto to environmental factors using recent data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey to understand factors influencing its expansion into the continental USA. A zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model was used to account for excess zero observations because this species was not observed on the majority of survey routes, despite its large geographical range. Model fit was improved when we included environmental covariates {{as compared with the}} null model, which only included distance from the route where this species was first observed. Probability of zero count was positively related to the dis-tance from the first route and road density and was inversely related to minimum tem-perature and distance to coast. Abundance of the species was positively related to road density and was inversely related to annual precipitation and distance to coast. Random intercept by land-cover type also improved model fit.

40|$|Trichomonas gallinae is an {{emerging}} pathogen in wild birds, linked to recent declines in finch (Fringillidae) populations across Europe. Globally, the main hosts for this parasite are species of Columbidae (doves and pigeons); here {{we carry out}} the first investigation into the presence and incidence of Trichomonas in four species of Columbidae in the UK, through live sampling of wild-caught birds and subsequent PCR. We report the first known UK cases of Trichomonas infection in 86 % of European Turtle Doves Streptopelia turtur sampled, along with 86 % of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Collared</b> <b>Doves</b> Streptopelia decaocto, 47 % of Woodpigeons Columba palumbus and 40 % of Stock Doves Columba oenas. Birds {{were more likely to be}} infected if the farm provided supplementary food for gamebirds. We found three strains of T. gallinae and one strain clustering within the Trichomonas tenax clade, not previously associated with avian hosts in the UK. One T. gallinae strain was identical at the ITS/ 5. 8 S/ITS 2 ribosomal region to that responsible for the finch trichomonosis epizootic. We highlight the importance of increasing our knowledge of the diversity and ecological implications of Trichomonas parasites in order further to understand the sub-clinical impacts of parasite infection...|$|R
