50|$|Several {{methods are}} used to {{determine}} the quality (temperature, salinity, solids content) of ancient sea water. The main one is the type of diatoms found in the sediment. Some species require salt water, while others require <b>fresh.</b> <b>Other</b> invertebrates serve as marker species as well. Also, periods of maximum supply from melt water are marked by low organic carbon in the sediment. Higher carbon content causes greater deposition of iron sulfide, which appears as a black varve.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to specify and {{estimate}} a complete demand system for fresh fruits in Canada. The Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) is used as the functional form to accomplish the {{purpose of this}} study. Fresh fruit was assumed to be weakly separable from all other goods at the first stage of the budgeting process and a conditional demand analysis for fresh fruit was carried out at the second stage of the budgeting process, treating total expenditure as an exogenous variable. At the second stage, expenditure on fresh fruit is allocated to five groups: apples, bananas, grapefruit, oranges, and <b>other</b> <b>fresh</b> fruit. The <b>other</b> <b>fresh</b> fruit group includes: apricots, blueberries, cherries, grapes, lemons, pineapples, and strawberries. The second stage allocation was estimated utilising Zellner's iterative SURE procedure with homogeneity and symmetry conditions imposed on the restricted model. Data used in this study were obtained from Statistics Canada and consist of thirty-four observations from 1960 [...] 1993. Results of the likelihood ratio test failed to reject the restricted model at 5 % significant level. The R-square and Durbin-Watson test statistics indicated that the fit of the model is satisfactory. This study showed that a system of fresh fruit demand is inelastic to total expenditure, own-price, and cross-price effects. All the expenditure elasticity estimates were positive and significant over the study period, and indicate that apples, grapefruit, and oranges were relatively normal goods, while bananas and <b>other</b> <b>fresh</b> fruit category were relative luxury goods. Apples and oranges, grapefruit and other fruit category, oranges and other fruit category, bananas and <b>other</b> <b>fresh</b> fruit category are substitutes; and apples and <b>other</b> <b>fresh</b> fruit category, oranges and the other fruits category are complements...|$|R

60|$|One fine forenoon--many {{weeks after}} the capture of Morley Jones--Dick Moy, Jack Shales, and Jerry MacGowl were engaged in {{painting}} and repairing buoys in the Trinity store on the pier at Ramsgate. The two former were enjoying their month of service on shore, the latter was on sick-leave, but convalescent. Jack was painting squares of alternate black and white on a buoy of a conical shape. Dick was vigorously scraping sea-weed and barnacles off a buoy of a round form. The store, or big shed, was full of buoys of all shapes; some new and <b>fresh,</b> <b>others</b> old and rugged; all {{of them would have}} appeared surprisingly gigantic to any one accustomed to see buoys only in their native element. The invalid sat on the shank of a mushroom anchor, and smoked his pipe while he affected to superintend the work.|$|R
