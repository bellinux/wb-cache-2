50|$|The snail-shaped cam {{is a part}} of the {{timekeeping}} {{train that}} revolves every twelve hours; often the snail is attached to the same pipe on which the hour hand is mounted. The diameter of the cam is largest at the one o'clock position, permitting the rack to move only a short distance, after which the striking train is stopped; it is smallest at the 12 o'clock position, which allows the rack to move the farthest. Striking stops when the last tooth of the rack has been taken up by the <b>gathering</b> <b>pallet.</b>|$|E
