5|$|The Resistance use {{the nuclear}} codes and the Spindly Torque {{to mount an}} assault on Deathshead's compound. Rescuing the {{captured}} resistance prisoners and evacuating them, Blazkowicz {{makes it to the}} top of the tower, struggling to Deathshead's workshop. Inside, Deathshead greets Blazkowicz, revealing to him that he possesses the brain of the soldier that Blazkowicz chose to die, and puts it in a robot. The robot comes alive and assaults Blazkowicz, who defeats it and puts his friend to rest by destroying the brain. Commandeering a larger robot mecha, Deathshead then attacks Blazkowicz, who gets the upper hand and destroys the robot, dragging Deathshead out of it. He repeatedly stabs Deathshead, who pulls out a grenade which explodes, killing Deathshead and mauling Blazkowicz. As a gravely wounded Blazkowicz crawls towards a window, he mentally recites The New Colossus as <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>the</b> Resistance survivors boarding a helicopter, alongside Anya and Set. Seeing that they have reached safety, and bleeding heavily from his injuries, Blazkowicz orders the Resistance to fire the nuclear cannon. After the credits, a helicopter is heard approaching.|$|E

Richard briefly considers contacting the police but realizes that the powerful Zapparoni could easily frame him.|$|E
25|$|One {{version of}} the cosmology, for example, states that Vishnu's eye is at the Southern Celestial Pole from where <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>the</b> cosmos. In another version found in section 4.80 of the Vayu Purana, he is the Hiranyagarbha, or the golden egg from which were {{simultaneously}} born all feminine and masculine beings of the universe. The Vishnu Purana presents Vishnu as the central element of its cosmology, unlike some other Puranas where Shiva or Brahma or goddess Shakti are. The reverence and the worship of Vishnu is described in 22 chapters of {{the first part of}} Vishnu Purana, along with the profuse use of the synonymous names of Vishnu such as Hari, Janardana, Madhava, Achyuta, Hrishikesha and others.|$|E
25|$|As {{the narrator}} reads of the knight's forcible {{entry into the}} dwelling, {{cracking}} and ripping sounds are heard somewhere in the house. When the dragon is described as shrieking as it dies, a shriek is heard, again within the house. As he relates the shield falling from off the wall, a reverberation, metallic and hollow, can be heard. Roderick becomes increasingly hysterical, and eventually exclaims that these sounds are being made by his sister, who was in fact alive when she was entombed. Additionally, Roderick somehow {{knew that she was}} alive. The bedroom door is then blown open to reveal Madeline standing there. She falls on her brother, and both land on the floor as corpses. The narrator then flees the house, and, as he does so, notices a flash of moonlight behind him which causes him to turn back, {{in time to see the}} moon shining through the suddenly widened crack. As <b>he</b> <b>watches,</b> <b>the</b> House of Usher splits in two and the fragments sink into the tarn.|$|E

25|$|The Salinas {{prepare to}} attend a ball, {{one of the most}} {{important}} of the Palermo social season. The Prince is both excited and concerned about the evening to come. It will be the first time Angelica and her beauty are to be presented to the public. However, he remains concerned that Don Calogero will make a complete fool of both himself and the Salinas. When Angelica (looking beautiful) and Don Calogero (looking acceptable) arrive shortly after, Angelica, thanks to detailed training in etiquette given to her by Tancredi, makes a huge social success. The Prince, after being satisfied that Angelica has been accepted, wanders through the rooms of the Palazzo Ponteleone where the ball is being held, becoming increasingly gloomy at the callowness of the young men, the boredom in the older men, and the silliness of the girls. The Prince notices Tancredi and Angelica dancing happily together, oblivious to the other's desperation, ambition, and greed. As <b>he</b> <b>watches,</b> <b>the</b> Prince comes to realize and accept, if only for a moment, that whatever happiness the lovers feel is to be celebrated, no matter what.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the film released in some countries, like the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, differs. Instead of a pitch, the films are connected {{by a group of}} three teenagers searching for the most banned film in the world, Movie 43, which will ultimately lead to the destruction of civilization. Calvin Cutler (Mark L. Young) and his friend J.J. (Adam Cagley) make a video in the style of MTV's Jackass and upload it on YouTube where it instantly reaches over 1,000,000 views. This turns out to be an April Fool's prank from Calvin's younger brother Baxter (Devin Eash), who cloned YouTube and hyper-inflated the views while working on his science project. Calvin and J.J. attempt to get revenge. They tell Baxter of a film that's so dangerous it will cause the annihilation of the world. The movie is known as Movie 43. While J.J. and Baxter look for Movie 43 on Google, Calvin retrieves Baxter's laptop and loads it with viruses from porn sites, and masturbates to a strip tease video on the porn sites in a bathroom. Baxter finds hundreds of results for Movie 43 on a website referred to by him as a dark corner of the Internet. They find the sketches starting from the 43rd search on the list of results. As he and J.J. keep watching videos, they are interrupted by a man known as Vrankovich (Fisher Stevens) and a group of Chinese mobsters (Tim Chou and James Hsu) who are tempted to find Movie 43, even going as far as to take J.J.'s classmate Stevie Schraeder (Nate Hartley), film executive Griffin Schraeder's oldest son, hostage. Vrankovich warns them that if they find Movie 43, civilization will be left to ruins. They ignore his claims and keep searching. They eventually find the real, the one and only Movie 43, which turns out to involve Baxter as a profane commando who leads a group of recruits to survive after the world has ended. As Calvin finishes ruining Baxter's laptop, their mother (Beth Littleford) enters, wearing the same shirt and shorts that the woman in the strip tease video wore, causing Calvin to flip out after realizing that he had masturbated to a video of his mother. He also has visions, and finds semen from his erect crotch on his hand causing him to stare at his hand in shock and horror. Afterward, a deadly earthquake rumbles and mankind is lost. However, a few years later the only survivor, a crippled Calvin, finds Baxter's laptop still working despite viral infections. <b>He</b> <b>watches</b> <b>the</b> last remaining skits on the laptop. This version of the film was released in the U.S. as part of the Blu-ray Disc of Movie 43 as an unrated alternate cut of the film.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "Mother Simpson" [...] was pitched by Richard Appel, {{who decided to}} do {{something}} about Homer's mother, who previously had only been mentioned once. Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced. Part of the fun of an episode about Homer's mother for the writers was {{that they were able to}} solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. The ending shot with Homer gazing at the sky was decided at the table read, but the drawing at the end was inserted by David Silverman because it was felt that the scene was so touching that no other lines were needed. As a result, no promos were aired over the credits during the original airing of the episode. Bill Oakley has admitted that he always gets teary-eyed when <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>the</b> ending.|$|E

After viewing the footage, they hold a bachelor party where Shawn questions all of the attendees. Shawn talks with Lacey Maxwell (Christine Chatelain), the sister of the groom, who asks him to get her bouquet from a locked cooler, but he can't. Before the wedding, the bouquets are passed out, and Lacey panics when hers isn't there. Lacey reveals she is a magician when she helps to calm down the flower girl. Shawn realizes who stole the ring and killed Manheim, but his realization occurs in the middle of the ceremony. Shawn interrupts the wedding with a [...] "psychic episode", and exposes Lacey to everyone.|$|E
500|$|Malcolm {{appears in}} William Shakespeare’s Macbeth as Malcolm. [...] He {{is the son}} of King Duncan and heir to the throne. He first appears in the second scene where he is talking to a {{sergeant}}, with Duncan. The sergeant tells them how the battle was won thanks to Macbeth. Then Ross comes and Duncan decides that Macbeth should take the title of Thane of Cawdor. Then he later appears in Act 1.4 talking about the execution of the former Thane of Cawdor. Macbeth [...] then enters and they congratulate him on his victory. He later appears in Macbeth’s castle as a guest. When his father is killed he is suspected of the murder so he escapes to England. He later makes an appearance in Act 4.3, where he talks to Macduff about Macbeth and what to do. They both decide to start a war against him. In Act 5.4 he is seen in Dunsinane getting ready for war. He orders the troops to hide behind branches and slowly advance towards the castle. In Act 5.8 <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>the</b> battle against Macbeth and Macduff with Siward and Ross. When eventually Macbeth is killed, Malcolm takes over as king.|$|E
500|$|The {{video is}} set in a forest; Jackson, in scruffy clothes, sings [...] "Childhood" [...] while sitting on a tree stump. The camera moves up the trees into the night sky and flying {{airships}} travel overhead. On board the ships, children are seen playing a variety of games as they travel further away from Jackson, towards the moon. Other children appear in the forest undergrowth before floating up towards the airships, but Jackson remains seated on the tree stump. Although the concept of the video had little in common with the corresponding film, Free Willy 2, two of its actors-Jason James Richter and Francis Capra-appear in the video. Richter appears halfway through, leading the armada of airships. Capra appears {{near the end of the}} video alongside Jackson as <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>the</b> airships above. Richter looks down and sees him and extends his arm to bring him up to the airship as Capra floats upward toward it. Erika Christensen and Jena Malone also appeared in the video playing baseball. The video for [...] "Childhood" [...] is 4:27 minutes long. In the publication, Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More!, Pratt describes the video as [...] "outstanding, a Chris Van Allsburg-style vision of children in flying airships, crusading through a forest at night".|$|E

500|$|Robert Thompson, a {{professor}} of communications {{and director of the}} Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, told The New York Times, [...] "There is something kind of unique about [...] It seems to be a refreshing breath from the pre-irony era. There's no sense of the elbow-in-rib, tongue-in-cheek aesthetic that so permeates the rest of American culture–including kids' shows like the Rugrats. I think what's subversive about it is it's so incredibly naive–deliberately. Because there's nothing in it that's trying to be hip or cool or anything else, hipness can be grafted onto it". In another interview with LA Times, he commentated on the show's adult audience: [...] " [...] It's a kind of time machine that transports parents back to when they watched TV in their footie [...] On the other hand, it's very hip in the way it's presented. It is very edgy to adults who know how to read and listen between the frames." [...] In a 2007 interview, Barack Obama named SpongeBob his favorite TV character and admitted that SpongeBob SquarePants is [...] "the show I watch with my daughters". British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also said <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>the</b> series with his children.|$|E
500|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals the}} story of Jordan, whose real name is Janardhan Jhakar a.k.a. JJ, a simple Jat boy, from Delhi. He is a student at Hindu College who dreams of becoming an international star, and this dream is often laughed at by his friends and classmates. Khatana(Kumud Mishra), the canteen owner, tells JJ that the one thing is common among all artists, singers, painters, etc., is 'pain,' especially, via a heartbreak. JJ jokingly tells himself that since he hasn't yet seen bad times, he won't {{be able to reach}} his idol's (Jim Morrison) level of fame. JJ accidentally sees a beautiful girl rehearsing before a dancing contest called [...] "Shut Up & Dance" [...] when he and his friends go to venue, where the contest is about to start. He goes inside only to see this girl's performance, even though he initially refuses to go inside the auditorium. <b>He</b> <b>watches</b> <b>the</b> performance of Heer Kaul (Nargis Fakhri), a Kashmiri Pandit from St. Stephens College, and overhears that she is the [...] "perfect heartbreaking machine". Since JJ wanted to succeed, and he remembers the word of Khatana telling him that pain, especially from heartbreak, is the way to become an artist, he decides to propose to Heer, but he suffers humiliation, which he deciphers as the perfect method for receiving the heart-break needed to achieve stardom. However, over time, JJ and Heer will become good friends, often going on fun, nasty, naughty, and spicy adventures together and sometimes engaging in behavior which the conservative JJ thinks is risky.|$|E
500|$|Similar to [...] "If I Can't Love Her", [...] "Evermore" [...] {{provides}} the Beast with [...] "a stronger voice". The song occurs at a pivotal {{moment in the}} film during which the Beast bemoans his decision to free Belle, while uncovering both his inner pain and growth as a character as he voices [...] "a sad sense of longing." [...] For the first time, audiences learn exactly how the Beast feels when he allows Belle to rescue Maurice, summarizing his love for her. In the musical sequence, the Beast continues to climb higher up the turret of his castle to watch Belle as she rides away on her horse and gradually disappears into the distance. Staged {{in a way that}} resembles a live musical due to Stevens' performance and its cinematography, the orchestra increases and swells as the anguished Beast continues to climb. Menken explained that the character, singing [...] "with a raw emotion", watches Belle leave while thinking to himself [...] "I know what love is now, and it's wonderful, even though I'll never see her again", and [...] "Evermore" [...] captures the Beast's agony as <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>the</b> woman he loves leave him. Citing the song {{as an example of the}} film's characters resorting to singing whenever they find that they are not able to speak, Condon described [...] "Evermore" [...] as one of the film's [...] "dramatic high points", proving that the Beast has finally become [...] "worthy of love". For the Beast, the song represents [...] "an ode to his love for Belle and his unending, longing devotion as she rides away from him, possibly forever", serving as [...] "a profound meditation on his own isolation and heartache". According to Menken, the character is [...] "basically singing about how he now knows what love is". The Beast is now shown to be capable of feeling and expressing human emotions, namely heartbreak, loneliness and helplessness, having learned about true love and sacrifice. According to Zoe Nicholson of The Daily Gamecock, [...] "Evermore" [...] "adds humanity not yet seen in a character regarded as savage or spoiled rotten." [...] Walt Disney Studios president of music and soundtracks Mitchell Leib described the scene as the film's [...] "Phantom of the Opera moment." [...] Traditionally in Disney films, heroines are typically assigned [...] "rousing" [...] musical numbers to perform. Screen Rant contributor Kacey Spivey observed that Belle's departure and the scene represents a reversal of the traditional fairy tale trope in which a princess is trapped in a tower. Instead the Beast is confined to his tower, longing for the heroine to return and free him from his enchantment. Brett Nachman compared the scene to Quasimodo performing [...] "Out There" [...] in Disney's animated musical The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996).|$|E
