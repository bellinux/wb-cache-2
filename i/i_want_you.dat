5|$|<b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> {{consisted}} of Gaye's first recorded studio material since his highly successful and well-received album Let's Get It On (1973). While it marked {{a change in}} musical direction for Gaye, departing from his trademark Motown and doo-wop-influenced sound for funky, light-disco soul, the album maintained and expanded on his previous work's sexual themes. Following a mixed response from critics {{at the time of}} its release, <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> has earned retrospective recognition from writers and music critics as one of Gaye's most controversial works and influential to such musical styles as disco, quiet storm, R, and neo soul.|$|E
5|$|On July 29, 2003, <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> was reissued by Motown as a two-disc {{expanded}} edition release, featuring 24-bit digital remastering of {{the original}} album's recordings, previously unissued material, and a 24-page booklet, which contains the original LP liner notes by Marvin Gaye, as well as comprehensive essays by writers including David Ritz.|$|E
5|$|Though it {{was often}} hinted that Let's Get It On was the album Gaye had {{dedicated}} to her, Marvin has stated that this album was dedicated to Hunter, who {{is believed to have}} been in the studio when he recorded it. According to music critics, her presence may have increased the emotion in Ware's and Gaye's conception of <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> is {{the fourteenth}} studio album by American soul {{musician}} Marvin Gaye, released March 16, 1976, on Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records. Recording sessions for the album took place throughout 1975 and 1976 at Motown Recording Studios, {{also known as}} Hitsville West, and Gaye's personal studio Marvin's Room in Los Angeles, California. The album has often been noted by critics for producer Leon Ware's exotic, low-key production and the erotic, sexual themes in his and Gaye's songwriting. The album's cover artwork adapts neo-mannerist artist Ernie Barnes's famous painting The Sugar Shack (1971).|$|E

In your case I am making an exception because <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> {{to know how much}} my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good.|$|E

You were my hero. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to be great. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to be surrounded by lovely dreams. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> your love to be a thing holy, helpful to you.' ...|$|R

We've found a couple of ideas on how to bust the form a bit, in order for all that information to reach you in a way that's a little oblique.|$|E
25|$|Richard Abanes {{argues that}} {{polygamy}} {{may have caused}} a shortage of brides in the early Mormon community. The New York Times reported in 1860 that apostle Heber C. Kimball stated (in an address to departing missionaries): Brethren, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> {{to understand that it}} is not to be as it has been heretofore. The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for themselves before they get here, and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all here before taking any of them, and let us all have a fair shake.|$|E

25|$|The album also {{provided}} another first in both Motown and R music: Gaye and his engineers had composed the album {{in a song}} cycle, segueing previous songs into other songs giving the album a more cohesive feel as opposed to R albums that traditionally included filler tracks to complete the album. This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as Stevie Wonder and Barry White making the concept album format a part of 1970s R music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album's concept. Let's Get It On repeated the suite-form arrangement of What's Going On, as would Gaye's later albums such as <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You,</b> Here, My Dear and In Our Lifetime.|$|E
25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} said {{anything}} about politics today. I don't propose {{to say anything about}} politics. You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E

60|$|Oh, you can't {{blame me}} for that. I'd loved you so long, so passionately. I'd never dared {{to hope that}} you cared for me. And when I knew! I never said a tenth part of what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to. <b>I</b> went home and I just wrote all that had filled my heart to overflowing. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to know how humbly {{grateful}} I was for the wonderful happiness you'd given me. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to know that my soul to its most hidden corners was yours for ever.|$|R

500|$|Gaye's albums, and {{especially}} <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You,</b> have been influential on modern soul music and contemporary R EMI Artists and Repertoire executive Gary Harris, who later assisted neo soul singer D'Angelo in recording his debut album Brown Sugar (1995), later commented on Gaye's significant artistry on <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> and its opening title track. In {{an interview with}} writer Michael Eric Dyson, Harris said: ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You,</b> Ware {{released}} Musical Massage (1976), which received little mainstream notice. Despite this, Musical Massage, Ware's second studio album, became a cult hit among soul music fans who were intrigued by <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> and songs from that album's producer. Critical recognition of Ware's album later improved, being cited by Allmusic as [...] "the perfect mix of soul, light funk, jazz, and {{what was about to}} become the rhythmic foundation for disco." ...|$|E
500|$|Such musicians as Todd Rundgren, Robert Palmer and Madonna {{have stated}} they were {{influenced}} by <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You,</b> while songs from the album have been sampled by such hip hop artists as EPMD to Mary J. Blige, who sampled the title track for her hit song [...] "Be Happy". The careers of neo soul and R musicians including D'Angelo, Musiq Soulchild, R. Kelly, Maxwell (particularly on Urban Hang Suite), Sade, and Prince show {{the influence of the}} soulful sound and equally romantic and erotic lyrics of <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You,</b> Let's Get It On and Leon Ware's Musical Massage. According to one critic, Ware's arrangements [...] "solidified the suite-like theme for the album." [...] Much like Let's Get It On, slow jam music, as well as modern soul and the quiet storm genre, are now viewed by critics to have been engendered by <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> and by Gaye.|$|E

500|$|<b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> was {{released}} March 16, 1976 in the United States on the Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records. While not as successful sales-wise as Gaye's previous landmark albums What's Going On and Let's Get It On, <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> sold {{in excess of}} 1 million copies in the United States with help mostly coming from its first single [...] "I Want You". The single topped the Billboard Soul Singles chart, quickly becoming Marvin Gaye's eleventh number-one hit on that chart, while peaking at number fifteen on the Billboard Pop Singles chart.|$|E
500|$|Another {{significant}} {{feature of}} the recording sessions for <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> was Gaye's use of the synthesizer in his music. During the time of recording, the instrument had entered its modern period of use and had {{been included in the}} music of such popular acts as Stevie Wonder and Led Zeppelin. For the instrumental version of [...] "After the Dance", Gaye implemented it for a more spacey sound than his previous recordings had featured. Other recordings from these sessions to feature Gaye's synthesizer were later featured on the deluxe edition re-release of <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You.</b>|$|E
500|$|Chris Payne of Billboard ranked {{it as the}} band's fifth best lead single, {{beating out}} [...] "Hash Pipe", [...] "(If You're Wondering If <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> To) <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> To", [...] "Pork and Beans", and [...] "Memories". Hilary Hughes of Fuse praised it as {{a return to the}} band's old sound, saying [...] "a {{promising}} look at what's sure to be a satisfying listen for new and old fans alike." [...] Ian Rogers from The Vine commented that it [...] "Sounds exactly like a highly professional, crassly commercial L.A. rock band performing a Weezer-styled song about Weezer returning to their roots." ...|$|E
