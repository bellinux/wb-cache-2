The primary question this paper addresses {{is whether the}} goods (new ships) price and service (sea <b>freight)</b> <b>rate</b> lead or lag {{one another in a}} Granger-cause sense, or simultaneously move together. Monthly panel data on 3 different bulk shipping market segments over the period 1998 to 2009 are exploited in empirical analysis. Various panel unit root tests demonstrate that the data variables are integrated with unit roots while panel cointegration techniques are used to estimate the dynamic relationship. A positive directional relationship from <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> to newbuilding price is found and <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> is more sensitive to market changes than newbuilding price.

5|$|For some time, {{there had}} been concern {{about the power of}} the railroads and the way they charged {{different}} rates for different customers. In 1885, a bill to regulate the practice, authored by John Henninger Reagan, of Texas passed the House. The Reagan bill forbade discrimination in railroad or pipeline <b>freight</b> <b>rates,</b> required that rates be reasonable, and fixed maximum charges allowed. Sherman agreed with the general idea of the law, but objected to certain portions, especially a provision that gave state courts jurisdiction over enforcement disputes. Sherman believed the law should allow for more nuance as well, insisting that competition against other forms of transit be considered. These changes were adopted in the conference committee and the result, the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, owed much to Sherman's influence. Cleveland signed it into law on February 4, 1887, and appointed members to the new Interstate Commerce Commission. The act displeased the railroad industry, but was a boon to farmers and the oil industry.|$|E
5|$|Of equal profile was Rutherford's government's {{management}} of the province's railways. Alberta's early years were optimistic ones, which manifested itself in a pronounced enthusiasm {{for the construction of}} new railway lines. Every town wanted to be a railway centre, and the government had great confidence in the ability of the free market to provide low <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> to the province's farmers provided sufficient charters were issued to competing companies. The legislature passed government-sponsored legislation setting out a framework for new railways in 1907, but interest from private firms in actually building the lines was limited. In the face of public demand and support by legislators of all parties for as rapid as possible an expansion of the province's lines, the government offered loan guarantees to several companies in exchange for commitments to build lines. Rutherford justified this in part by his conviction that railways needed to expand along with population, rather than having railway expansion follow population growth as would be the case without government intervention. The Conservatives argued that this strategy didn't go far enough, and called for direct government ownership.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{application}} of System dynamics and Chaos theory in shipping using the example of <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> forming. The development of new technologies, changes in structure and conditions, information accessibility, etc. are {{only some of the}} factors that intensify changes in <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> forming in shipping. Therefore, shipping environment is becoming increasingly complex and dynamic. System dynamics seems to be a tool very suited for modelling of strategic and operational behaviour in shipping business. Due to the complex behaviour of these systems, chaos theory can also help in modelling of processes in shipping. The basic feature of chaotic systems is fine sensitivity in conditions at the beginning, when small change in input value may cause great changes in output values. By applying its concepts to the business process, as well as in <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> forming in shipping, it prepares the business systems for quick response to the changes in the environment.

25|$|Vale's {{decision}} of constructing {{a fleet of}} 400,000-ton ore carriers was widely criticized by other shipping companies. The new Valemax ships, expected to cut the company's transportation costs by 20–25%, were blamed for driving down the <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> for the entire industry, swelling the already oversupplied bulk transportation market and stalling {{the recovery of the}} shipping business after the financial crisis. The <b>freight</b> <b>rates,</b> down 80% from 2008, were expected to drop further down to the levels of 1977. According to the chief executive of BIMCO, the Valemax vessels could displace up to 168 150,000–180,000-ton capesize bulk carriers, around 15% of the existing fleet, from the long haul voyages and force them to less profitable shorter routes. Vale responded to the criticism by stating that the company aims to permanently cut the costs of Atlantic-Pacific dry bulk shipping to make Brazilian ore more competitive against iron ore produced in Australia, which is closer to major customers in Asia.|$|E

The demand is derived from international trade and {{is assumed to be}} exogenous, while the fleet capacity increases with new orders made two years before, proportional to the industrial profit. Assuming the market clears each year, the shipping <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> will change with the relative magnitude of shifts in the demand and fleet capacity. This model is estimated using the world container shipping market statistics from 1980 to 2008, applying the three-stage least square method. The estimated parameters of the model have high statistical significance, and the overall explanatory power of the model is above 90 %. The short-term in-sample prediction of the model can largely replicate the container shipping market fluctuation in terms of the fleet size dynamics and the <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> fluctuation in the past 20 years. The prediction of the future market trend reveals that the container <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> should continue to decrease in the coming three years if the demand for container transportation services grows at less than 8 %...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturing firms buy {{transport}} services {{with the aim}} of minimizing their total logistics cost. There is a large amount of literature analyzing how shippers value the various characteristics of a transport service, mostly performed by collecting stated-preference data and estimating discrete choice models. Most of the empirical studies specify the deterministic part of the utility functions as linear in the observed attributes. This implicitly constrains the characteristics of the analyzed transport service to be perfect substitutes, and to have a constant substitutability ratio. Such an assumption is inconsistent with the standard microeconomic theory, typically assuming inputs’ decreasing marginal productivity, and may not be realistic. The paper tests the linearity assumption for <b>freight</b> <b>rate,</b> travel time, probability of having damaged and lost freight, frequency, flexibility, mode and punctuality on a sample of Italian small- and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SME). Our findings suggest that the linearity-in-the-attributes assumption should be rejected and that the marginal impact on the utility-of-profit of the attributes is not constant. More specifically travel time and <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> produce decreasing marginal reductions of the utility-of-profit; while safety (percentage of not damaged or lost shipments) and punctuality (percentage of shipments on time) are responsible for increasing marginal contributions to the utility-of-profit. The substitutability ratios between (a) <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> and loss and damage, (b) <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> and travel time, (c) <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> and punctuality, (d) travel time and damage and loss and (e) travel time and punctuality are estimated and found not constant.
