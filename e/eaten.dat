40|$|Picky <b>eating</b> is a {{childhood}} behavior that vexes many parents {{and is a}} symptom in the newer diagnosis of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) in adults. Pressure to <b>eat,</b> a parental controlling feeding practice aimed at encouraging a child to <b>eat</b> more, is associated with picky <b>eating</b> {{and a number of}} other childhood <b>eating</b> concerns. Low intuitive <b>eating,</b> an insensitivity to internal hunger and satiety cues, is also associated with a number of problem <b>eating</b> behaviors in adulthood. Whether picky <b>eating</b> and pressure to <b>eat</b> are predictive of young adult <b>eating</b> behavior is relatively unstudied. Current adult intuitive <b>eating</b> and disordered <b>eating</b> behaviors were self-reported by 170 college students, along with childhood picky <b>eating</b> and pressure through retrospective self- and parent reports. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that childhood parental pressure to <b>eat,</b> but not picky <b>eating,</b> predicted intuitive <b>eating</b> and disordered <b>eating</b> symptoms in college students. These findings suggest that parental pressure in childhood is associated with problematic <b>eating</b> patterns in young adulthood. Additional research is needed to understand the extent to which parental pressure is a reaction to or perhaps compounds the development of problematic <b>eating</b> behavior...|$|R

40|$|The {{immediate}} effect of maternal {{control of their}} daughter's <b>eating</b> is well documented. However, the longterm effect of both maternal and paternal control of <b>eating</b> during childhood on adults' current <b>eating</b> attitudes and behaviors has been a relatively unexplored area. Parents {{play a central role}} in shaping the family <b>eating</b> environment, which provides a context for the child's relationship with food for years to come (Birch, Fisher, Grimm-Thomas, Markey, Sawyer & Johnson, 2001). The present study focused on expanding the existing knowledge base concerning parental control over <b>eating.</b> Two hundred sixty-seven female adult participants completed a questionnaire packet designed to measure maternal and paternal restriction and pressure to <b>eat</b> during childhood, family mealtime stress during childhood, current restriction, binge <b>eating,</b> emotional <b>eating,</b> <b>eating</b> from external cues, and current affect during meals. Results indicated that parental pressure to <b>eat</b> during childhood are related to restricted <b>eating,</b> emotional <b>eating,</b> and <b>eating</b> from external cues during adulthood. Family mealtime stress during childhood was related to binge <b>eating,</b> restricted <b>eating,</b> emotional <b>eating,</b> <b>eating</b> from external cues, and negative affect while <b>eating</b> during adulthood. Implications for practice and recommendations for future research are presented...|$|R

30|$|Mindfulness is {{also related}} {{to the concept of}} {{intuitive}} <b>eating,</b> which describes the tendency of an individual to be observant of his or her body signals and emotions and to <b>eat</b> according to physical hunger and satiety cues rather than emotions and rigid rules about the “right” and “wrong” types of food. Intuitive <b>eating</b> encourages the pleasure derived from <b>eating,</b> along with a healthy relationship with food, mind, and body, instead of engaging in reactive maladaptive <b>eating</b> behaviors. Therefore, intuitive <b>eating</b> encompasses the mindfulness components of acceptance and awareness (Tribole and Resch, 2012). A study by Duarte et al. (2016) found that intuitive <b>eating</b> significantly moderated the relationship between negative affect and binge <b>eating,</b> suggesting that increased levels of intuitive <b>eating</b> may buffer the effects of depressive symptoms on binge <b>eating.</b> Mindful <b>eating</b> and intuitive <b>eating</b> {{have been found to be}} inversely associated with binge and emotional <b>eating</b> (Katterman, Kleinman, Hood, Nackers, and Corsica, 2014). As those concepts of mindful and intuitive <b>eating</b> represent adaptive <b>eating</b> behaviors, related especially with present moment awareness, these variables are naturally inversely associated with <b>eating</b> triggered by emotions or lacking awareness, like in binge or emotional <b>eating.</b> However, the effect of an DBT skills training-based intervention and time still need to be examined in intuitive <b>eating</b> and mindful <b>eating.</b> Moreover, if DBT skills training leads to the path of mindful <b>eating</b> (Wisniewski, Safer, and Chen, 2007) the mediational role of mindful <b>eating</b> needs to be investigated.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine, in a general population, the {{resemblance}} in <b>eating</b> behaviour between adolescents and their parents. This study was based on the first examination of a community-based epidemiological study in Northern France. Subjects were offspring aged 14 - 22 years (135 boys and 125 girls) and their parents (174 fathers and 205 mothers). The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised 18 -item version (TFEQ-R 18) identified three aspects of <b>eating</b> behaviour: cognitive restraint of <b>eating,</b> uncontrolled <b>eating</b> and emotional <b>eating.</b> Familial resemblance in <b>eating</b> behaviour was measured by partial Spearman's correlations, adjusted for age and body mass index. Sons' uncontrolled <b>eating</b> was positively related to fathers' cognitive restraint of <b>eating</b> (r = 0. 36), but not to fathers' uncontrolled <b>eating</b> (r = 0. 07), nor to mothers' <b>eating</b> behaviour. Sons' cognitive restraint of <b>eating</b> was related to no parental <b>eating</b> behaviour scores. In daughters, cognitive restraint of <b>eating</b> was positively related to mothers' uncontrolled <b>eating</b> (r = 0. 26), but not to mothers' cognitive restraint of <b>eating</b> (r = 0. 13). Daughters' uncontrolled <b>eating</b> and emotional <b>eating</b> were positively associated with the same scores in mothers. Finally, daughters' <b>eating</b> behaviour was not related to fathers' <b>eating</b> behaviour. In conclusion, correlations in <b>eating</b> behaviour were higher with the parent of the same gender, and <b>eating</b> behaviours in adolescents seem to reflect opposition to parents' behaviour more than familial resemblance...|$|R
40|$|On a new {{framework}} for anorexia nervosa, learning to <b>eat</b> is central intervention; as patients regain a normal pattern of <b>eating</b> their problems dissolve. Mandometer®, a development of previous methods, allows simultaneous recording of <b>eating</b> {{rate and the}} development of satiety as well as experimental manipulation of <b>eating</b> rate. By measuring <b>eating</b> behavior {{during the course of a}} meal with this method, women were divided into those <b>eating</b> at a decelerated rate and those <b>eating</b> at a constant rate. Decelerated eaters are able to resists experimental challenges such as <b>eating</b> at an increased or decreased rate, but linear eaters <b>eat</b> more or less food in these experimental conditions. Satiety develops similarly in both decelerated and lineal eaters. Linear eaters develop a pattern of <b>eating</b> similar to that of anorexic patients when <b>eating</b> at a decreased rate, they <b>eat</b> less food yet experience an increase in satiety. Linear eaters can learn to <b>eat</b> at a decelerated rate and if they do they can resist overeating when tested to <b>eat</b> at a high rate. As a result of the learning, they also score lower on restrained <b>eating,</b> a cognitive construct thought of as a cause of <b>eating</b> behavior. Skipping dinner increases the linearity of <b>eating</b> and reduces food intake in women but has the opposite effect in men; these changes in <b>eating</b> behavior can be reversed by feedback on how to <b>eat</b> during the meal. The conditions of the school dinner in secondary schools are such that the speed of <b>eating</b> increases by 50 % and food intake gets distorted from its normal pattern. The change can be reversed by <b>eating</b> in a relaxed condition or by feedback on how to <b>eat</b> during the meal. It is suggested that linear <b>eating</b> is a risk factor for <b>eating</b> disorders and that the risk can be reduced by practicing <b>eating</b> using feedback on how to <b>eat</b> properly...|$|R
