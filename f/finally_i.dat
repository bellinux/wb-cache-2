He writes: [...] "The problem was that [...] {{was in love with}} Jesus. He was the most decent person I ever met in that field... and {{he was in love with}} Jesus....

500|$|On 21 May 1942, The Shooting Star {{concluded}} serialisation. Less {{than a week}} later, {{the occupied}} government proclaimed that all Jews in Belgium would {{have to wear a}} yellow badge on their clothing, and in July the Gestapo began raids on Jewish premises, followed by deportations of Jews to Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps, resulting in around 32,000 Belgian Jews being killed. Hergé later recalled: [...] "I saw very few Jews wearing the yellow star, but <b>finally</b> <b>I</b> did see some. They told me that some Jews were gone; that people had come for them and sent them away. I didn't want to believe it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Live Together, Die Alone" [...] {{has been}} {{generally}} well received. IGN's Eric Goldman praised actor Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond Hume) for giving [...] "a likable, sympathetic performance". Goldman {{went on to}} say that the episode [...] "was a much better finale than last season", and that it contained one of the [...] "more interesting flashbacks of the entire season". Entertainment Weekly writer Scott Brown described his viewing experience as [...] "I was up, I was down, I was frustrated, I was thrilled, and <b>finally</b> <b>I</b> was...well, a bit numb." [...] Brown criticized the way Charlie reacted to the hatch explosion, stating that he felt the writers were trying to [...] "get us to hate Charlie".|$|E

Eighty prisoners from the train, including Pechersky, were selected for work in Lager II. The remaining 1,920 Jews were immediately led to the gas chambers. Pechersky later recalled his thoughts as the train pulled up to Sobibor, [...] "How many circles of hell were there in Dante's Inferno? It seems there were nine. How many have already passed? Being surrounded, being captured, camps in Vyazma, Smolensk, Borisov, Minsk... And <b>finally</b> <b>I</b> am here. What's next?" [...] The appearance of Soviet POWs produced an enormous impression on Sobibor prisoners: [...] "hungry hope-filled eyes following their every move".|$|E

500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, I remember saying, [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. What could it be?" [...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. <b>Finally,</b> <b>I</b> got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E
500|$|Wisden {{describes}} {{how in the}} first innings, Agnew's accuracy was affected by debutant nerves, but an improved display in the second innings resulted in figures of 2–51. Agnew {{describes how}} Ian Botham helped him secure both wickets, catching Gordon Greenidge in the slips, and passing on some {{advice on how to}} dismiss Viv Richards, Botham's great friend: [...] "Botham said: 'Right. Don't pitch a single ball up at him. Have two men back for the hook, and bowl short every ball.' This I did for three overs or so, by which time Viv was looking a little exasperated, but was definitely on the back foot. <b>Finally</b> <b>I</b> pitched one up, the great man missed it and umpire David Constant ruled that Richards was LBW for 15." [...] Wisden called the pair of batsmen Agnew's [...] "first illustrious victims in Test cricket".|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov felt talented {{students}} needed little formal dictated instruction. His teaching method included distinct steps: show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint; direct them {{in understanding the}} forms of composition; give them {{a year or two}} of systematic study in the development of technique, exercises in free composition and orchestration; instill a good knowledge of the piano. Once these were properly completed, studies would be over. He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes. Conductor Nikolai Malko remembered that Rimsky-Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying, [...] "I will speak, and you will listen. Then I will speak less, and you will start to work. And <b>finally</b> <b>I</b> will not speak at all, and you will work." [...] Malko added that his class followed exactly this pattern. [...] "Rimsky-Korsakov explained everything so clearly and simply that all we had to do was to do our work well." ...|$|E
