5|$|A {{sequel to}} Songs in the <b>Key</b> <b>of</b> Springfield was {{released}} in October 1999, titled Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons. It contained songs that {{had appeared in the}} series since the previous soundtrack album was released, as well as some earlier ones that did not make the cut in Songs in the <b>Key</b> <b>of</b> Springfield. Most of the 53 tracks featured were composed by Clausen.

5000|$|The <b>keys</b> <b>of</b> heaven or <b>keys</b> <b>of</b> Saint Peter {{are seen}} as a symbol of papal authority: [...] "Behold he Peter {{received}} the <b>keys</b> <b>of</b> the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib.

5|$|After the cadence, the {{movement}} is punctuated by a second rendition of the four-bar orchestral ritornello. This time the oboes play the semiquaver motif, the alto recorders play the pair of detached quavers on the beat and the upper strings those off the beat.

5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed sequentially, similarly to a linked list. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a unique key, but other, , record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as C‑ISAM and VSAM, are based on IBM's ISAM. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, {{but they do not}} have alternate keys. A relative record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a <b>key</b> <b>of</b> 10. This means that creating a record with a <b>key</b> <b>of</b> 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. Relative files also allow for both sequential and random access.|$|E
5|$|During the event, a Warlord infiltrates Camelot and poisons Squire Everett. The party {{collects}} {{an antidote}} in the Swamp of Zagar and saves the Squire.

5|$|Of all {{the strains}} in the piece, the final D strain {{is perhaps the}} most interesting. It is written in B-flat minor. When Joplin used minor keys in the {{previous}} sections, he used the relative <b>key</b> <b>of</b> G minor (i.e., relative to the main <b>key</b> <b>of</b> B-flat major). However, in this fourth section, he instead used the parallel key. This strain also features sections where the right hand and left hand play notes in unison, and in which the standard 2/4 time left-hand beat is noticeably absent.|$|E
