Approximately one-third of applied irrigation water leaves irrigated field as surface runoff and subsurface drainage. In this project, we implemented seven standard and improved irrigation and fertigation management practices on a commercial alfalfa field to reduce the load and concentration of phosphorus and sediment in <b>drainage</b> <b>waters.</b> Reducing the amount of surface runoff after the application of P fertilizer is a key factor in reducing the load of P in <b>drainage</b> <b>waters.</b> The loads of P in runoff waters were reduced by as much as 75 % compared to normal irrigation and fertigation practices. Water-run application of P increased the concentration and load of P in runoff water by almost 100 % compare to broadcast P applications.

Fluorescence intensities of Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) present in different pollutant sources and <b>drainage</b> <b>waters</b> in the Den Brook catchment (Devon, UK) were monitored through storm events occurring between January 2007 and June 2008. Contrasting fluorescence signals from different sources confirmed the technique’s usefulness as a tracer of pollutants from livestock farming. Changes in fluorescence intensities of <b>drainage</b> <b>waters</b> throughout storm events were used to assess the dynamics of key pollutant sources. The farmyard area of the catchment studied was shown to contribute polluted runoff at the onset of storm events in response to only small amounts of rain, when flows in the Den Brook first-order channel were low. The application of slurry to a field within the catchment did not elevate the fluorescence of <b>drainage</b> <b>waters</b> during storm events suggesting that when slurry is applied to undrained fields the fluorescent DOM may become quickly adsorbed onto soil particles and/or immobilised through bacterial breakdown. Fluorescence intensities of <b>drainage</b> <b>waters</b> were successfully combined with discharge data in a two component mixing model to estimate pollutant fluxes from key sources during the January 2007 storm event.

40|$|International audienceMining {{activity}} has generated {{large amounts of}} mining wastes abandoned on the site after extraction, concentration or metallurgic processes. In this study assessment of the long term behaviour of mining wastes has been performed by the realisation of a dynamic leaching test performed with a Soxhlet device on mining wastes from two contrasted sites : Bentaillou and Saint-Salvy from south-west France. Sphalerite and galena {{are the source of}} heavy metals, (Zn, Cd and Pb) in both sites. Pyrite and pyrrothite are the main potential acid source in Saint-Salvy and Bentaillou respectively. Although both wastes display high contents of carbonate minerals associated to the metal bearing phases, their composition is different, calcite for Bentaillou and siderite for Saint-Salvy allowing different minerals transformations and <b>drainage</b> mining <b>water</b> compositions. Due to different impoundment type, dumps for Bentaillou and a dam for Saint-Salvy, oxidation reactions are favoured in the former compared to the latter. Waste <b>drainage</b> <b>waters</b> generated in situ display lower pH, Eh and higher Fe and heavy metals in <b>drainage</b> <b>waters</b> from Saint-Salvy compared to those from Bentaillou. The leaching experiments lasted 62 days and 84 days for Bentaillou sample and Saint-Salvy sample respectively corresponding to an equivalent time of 288 and 183 years respectively calculated from pluviometry in situ. During the experiment, the amounts of elements released was higher for Saint-Salvy sample (0. 2 % of Zn, and Pb and 1, 4 % of Cd) than for the Bentaillou one (9. 7 % of Zn, and 0. 15 % of Pb and 46 % of Cd).

40|$|Irrigation {{has long}} {{played a key}} role in feeding the {{expanding}} world population and is expected to play a still greater role in the future. As supplies of good-quality irrigation water are expected to decrease in several regions due to increased municipal-industrial-agricultural competition, available freshwater supplies need to be used more efficiently. In addition, reliance on the use and reuse of saline andyor sodic <b>drainage</b> <b>waters,</b> generated by irrigated agriculture, seems inevitable for irrigation. The same applies to salt-affected soils, which occupy more than 20 % of the irrigated lands, and warrant attention for efficient, inexpensive and environmentally acceptable management. Technologically and from a management perspective, a couple of strategies have shown the potential to improve crop production under irrigated agriculture while minimizing the adverse environmental impacts. The first strategy, vegetative bioremediation?a plant-assisted reclamation approach?relies on growing appropriate plant species that can tolerate ambient soil salinity and sodicity levels during reclamation of salt-affected soils. A variety of plant species of agricultural significance have been found to be effective in sustainable reclamation of calcareous and moderately sodic and saline-sodic soils. The second strategy fosters dedicating soils to crop production systems where saline andyor sodic waters predominate and their disposal options are limited. Pr oduction systems based on salttolerant plant species using <b>drainage</b> <b>waters</b> may be sustainable with the potential of transforming such waters from an environmental burden into an economic asset. Such a strategy would encourage the disposal of <b>drainage</b> <b>waters</b> within the irrigated regions where they are generated rather than exporting these waters to other regions via discharge into main irrigation canals, local streams, or rivers. Being economically and environmentally sustainable, these strategies could be the key to future agricultural and economic growth and social wealth in regions where saltaffected soils exist andyor where saline-sodic <b>drainage</b> <b>waters</b> are generated...|$|R

25|$|The {{contamination}} of both groundwater and nearby streams {{may be for}} long periods of time. Deterioration of stream quality results from acid mine drainage, toxic trace elements, high content of dissolved solids in mine <b>drainage</b> <b>water,</b> and increased sediment loads discharged to streams. When coal surfaces are exposed, pyrite comes in contact with water and air and forms sulfuric acid. As water drains from the mine, the acid moves into the waterways; as long as rain falls on the mine tailings the sulfuric-acid production continues, whether the mine is still operating or not. Also waste piles and coal storage piles can yield sediment to streams. Surface waters may be rendered unfit for agriculture, human consumption, bathing, or other household uses.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} formal {{long-term}} national water resources planning {{was introduced in}} Egypt through foreign technical assistance during the 1970s. In 1981 a Master Plan for Water Resources Development and Use was finalized {{with the support of}} UNDP and the World Bank. Rather than being an actual plan, the document aimed at introducing planning tools such as data bases and flow models that would allow better planning. In subsequent years a number of events increased water scarcity. These include a drought in 1979-88; cessation in 1983 of construction works on the Jonglei Canal in Sudan; and a revitalization of a land reclamation program, requiring one billion m3 of additional water each year. These events helped trigger a greater emphasis on integrated long-term water planning. In 1990 the government adopted its first national water plan covering the period until 2000. Under the plan the government stopped releases of water from Lake Nasser that was only destined for power generation. It also decided to replace old barrages with new ones and it launched the National Irrigation Improvement Program. Furthermore, it aimed to increase the re-use of <b>drainage</b> <b>water</b> and the use of groundwater. On the demand side, water release to the sea at times of low water demand in winter {{for the sole purpose of}} maintaining navigation and to regulate sea water intrusion in the Delta was to be reduced. During the period of the plan land reclamation was to continue at a rate of 60,000 hectares per year. The Plan assumed that the Jonglei Canal would be built by 2000.|$|E
40|$|Many former metal mining {{areas of}} the UK are characterised by circum-neutral pH, low-Fe {{drainage}} with concentrations of Zn, Pb and Cd that exceed EU <b>water</b> quality guidelines. <b>Drainage</b> <b>waters</b> from these former mining areas present a challenging target for remediation.

40|$|When {{compared}} with intensive indoor pro-duction, outdoor pig production is consid-ered by consumers as the production system {{that causes the}} least negative environmental effects and contributes to animal welfare. Nevertheless, the continuous input of nutri-ents in food or pig excretions, increases soil nutrients levels, {{as is the case}} with phospho-rus (P). This continuous soil P input may exceed soil retention capacity for phosphate and could lead to loss/transfer of P from soil to <b>drainage</b> or runoff <b>waters,</b> contributing to non point source pollution of superficial wa-ters. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of outdoor pig produc-tion on soil P levels, its spatial and temporal distribution and also P loss from this area to <b>drainage</b> <b>waters.</b> Experimental outdoor pig production area has 2. 8 ha, slope between 5 and 30 %, with an animal charge of 9 adults/ ha.

500|$|Flows at {{the mouth}} have {{steadily}} declined {{since the beginning of}} the 20thcentury, and in most years after 1960 the Colorado River has run dry before reaching the sea. Irrigation, industrial, and municipal diversions, evaporation from reservoirs, natural runoff, and likely climate change have all contributed to this substantial reduction in flow, threatening the future water supply. For example, the Gila River – formerly one of the Colorado's largest tributaries – contributes little more than a trickle in most years due to use of its water by cities and farms in central Arizona. The average flow rate of the Colorado at the northernmost point of the Mexico–United States border (NIB, or Northerly International Boundary) is about , [...] per year – less than a 10th of the natural flow – due to upstream water use.
