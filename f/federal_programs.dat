5|$|The Great Depression, {{although}} negative to {{the local}} economy, also benefited the San Diego State Teachers College, {{as the federal government}} made money available for construction projects in an attempt to stimulate the economy. For the campus, some of these construction projects included new buildings (such as a $500,000 stadium completed in 1936 and a $200,000 open air theater completed in 1941), facilities, and art works. Several <b>federal</b> <b>programs</b> were also created to give jobs to students and to increase financial aid.|$|E
5|$|The {{mayor and}} council set local taxes and a budget, {{which must be}} {{approved}} by Congress. The Government Accountability Office and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the District's local budget of anywhere between $470million and over $1billion per year. Congress typically provides additional grants for <b>federal</b> <b>programs</b> such as Medicaid and the operation of the local justice system; however, analysts claim that the payments do not fully resolve the imbalance.|$|E
5|$|This section covers {{compliance}} with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). This act provides for uniform and equitable treatment of persons displaced by a <b>federal</b> <b>programs</b> from their homes, businesses, or farms, including assuring just compensation and assisting in relocation. For example, if {{the construction of a}} highway under a federal program requires the expropriation of homes, the expropriation must be made by either providing fair compensation for that property or providing assistance for, or reimbursement of, relocation expenses incurred by the affected person. The Compliance Supplement suggests verifying that the property acquired is appraised by qualified independent appraisers, the appraisals are examined by a review appraiser to assure acceptability, and that after acceptance, the review appraiser certifies the recommended or approved value of the property for just compensation to the owner.|$|E

40|$|Federal surface {{transportation}} policy is at a fateful crossroads. Since {{the completion of}} the Interstate system, the <b>federal</b> <b>program</b> has lost its focus and its sense of purpose. And the user-pays funding mechanism used to build that system have gradually been transformed into a public works tax for Congress to spend on its own [...] rather than highway users’ [...] priorities. Most calls to reformulate the <b>federal</b> <b>program</b> would further break faith with highway customers. While appearing to advocate simplification and program consolidation, they would add costly new non-highway programs, increasing highway use taxes but spending much of the proceeds on new kinds of non-highway programs, from passenger trains to energy subsidies to federalized land-use planning. Yet it is thanks to these very trends that American taxpayers no longer have trust in the Highway Trust Fund. Instead of welcoming an expanded <b>federal</b> <b>program,</b> most oppose increases in fuel taxes as unlikely to improve their own transportation situations. This study argues that the <b>federal</b> <b>program</b> needs to be rethought. Every serious study in recent years has concluded that America is under-investing in highway infrastructure...|$|R
