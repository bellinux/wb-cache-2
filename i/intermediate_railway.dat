25|$|During the 1960s, the Drammen Line {{was being}} planned {{to connect to}} Oslo East Station through the {{proposed}} Oslo Tunnel. This would make Oslo West Station unnecessary, and would allow a central station to be built {{at the location of}} the East Station. The railway tunnel was planned with an <b>intermediate</b> <b>railway</b> station at Nationaltheatret. Simultaneously, Oslo Sporveier worked on possibilities to connect their eastern and western networks, and extend both to the city core. During the 1960s, the planning office for the metro proposed a tunnel between Nationaltheatret and Jernbanetorget, which would run parallel to the Oslo Tunnel. The initial plans called for a station at Slottsparken, close to Nationaltheatret, which would serve as the transfer point between the metro and the western light rail. This station was designed to handle 25,000 people per day.|$|E

50|$|A new {{section that}} {{includes}} six new stations along the South Ayalon Highway and Highway 4 {{was constructed in}} the early 2000s and connected the Coastal Railway with the Ashdod Railway Station (which is technically located on the Lod-Ashkelon railway). The first phase of this work involved extending the coastal railway from the HaHagana Railway Station to the new Rishon LeZion Moshe Dayan Railway Station, serving the southern Tel Aviv area suburbs and opening for service in September 2011. The remainder of the route to Ashdod opened in 2013, with the <b>intermediate</b> Yavne West <b>Railway</b> Station having opened in early 2012. This last section features a long cut-and-cover tunnel south of Yavne and a large flying junction {{at the intersection of}} the new coastal railway with the Lod-Ashkelon railway and the railway branch to the Port of Ashdod. From Ashdod, the existing railway from Lod extends south along the coast to near Yad Mordechai through Ashkelon (with a connection to the Heletz railway).

5000|$|Groudle, a glen on the {{outskirts}} of Onchan on the Isle of Man, is formed in a valley leading to the sea at the small port of the same name. [...] It was a remote hamlet boasting only a handful of small cottages until linked to the Manx Electric Railway in 1893, at which time it was developed as a tourist attraction. Originally billed as [...] "The Fern Land Of Mona!", the glen was further improved in the late 19th century by the planting of many different types of tree. Whereas most glens are formed naturally, it was a conscious effort by the owners to provide part of the attraction to the Victorian visitor by being able to inspect a wide variety of trees, something which is still evident today. At the beach there were bowling and croquet greens, a mill, crofters' cottages and a bridge accessing the Howstrake Holiday Camp which was on the adjacent headland. At the point where the pack-horse road (now a footpath) crosses the railway line there is an old lime kiln from which the <b>intermediate</b> <b>railway</b> station also takes its name.|$|E
50|$|Today's railway is a {{fraction}} of its original size, having served the western town of Peel, northern town of Ramsey and the small mining village of Foxdale. Since 1969 only the southern line has been operational. Although it is {{only about half of}} its former size, Douglas railway station is still an impressive complex. After crossing the River Douglas, the line climbs the two-and-a-half-mile-long 1-in-65 Nunnery Bank through a wide rock cutting that brings it through a large estate, past an industrial estate to the White Hoe, where the island's largest brewery is passed on the left of the train before crossing the first bridge. The train continues to climb to Port Soderick, just prior to which passengers get the first view of the sea at Keristal, before descending into the railway station. The train then passes through Crogga Woods, under another bridge at Meary Veg (centre for the island's sewage treatment works) and climbs, reaching its summit (588 ft, marked by a board visible from the train) close to the site of Ballacostain Halt. The train descends to Santon, the only <b>intermediate</b> <b>railway</b> station in substantially original condition. From here the train descends at 1 in 60 to Ballasalla railway station, with interesting sea-cliff views to the east, and regular service trains cross here. After Ballasalla the line runs over relatively flat land past the request halt at Ronaldsway to the ancient capital of Castletown.After Castletown the railway crosses the Silver Burn and heads northwest across country to the diminutive request stop at Ballabeg railway station. It then turns west for the short run to Colby, which is popular with the locals. After a request stop at the Level the train continues to Port St. Mary, with views of Bradda Head and Milner's Tower on this stretch of line to Port Erin. Port Erin railway station is home to the Whistle Stop Cafe providing light refreshments and the Isle of Man Railway Museum, established in 1975 with two locomotives and rolling stock including the Queen's Coach and Governor's Saloon from the opening of the line in 1873. The majority of the line runs through countryside, with only small stretches being close to built-up areas. Many people start or end their journey in Port Erin, a Victorian sea-side resort, or in Castletown, the ancient capital. Ronaldsway Halt, between Ballasalla and Castletown is a few hundred yards' walk from the airport. There are several farm crossings and rural request stops along the picturesque line which largely serve adjoining fields and localised communities, this being especially prevalent on the southernmost section which passes through agricultural land. The line passes along the southern plain following the more hilly landscape north of Ballasalla.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a case study on freight railway {{transportation}} in Italy, which is a by-product of research collaboration with a major Italian railway company. We highlight the main features of the Italian reality and propose a customized mathematical model to design the service network, that is, the set of origin-destination connections. More specifically, the model suggests the services to provide, the number of trains travelling on each connection, the number of cars and their type. We consider both full and empty freight car movements and take handling costs into account. All decisions are taken {{in order to minimize}} the total costs. The quality of service is guaranteed by satisfying all the transportation demand and by implicitly minimizing the waiting time of cars at <b>intermediate</b> <b>railway</b> stations. Our approach yields to a multi-commodity network design problem with a concave cost function. To solve this problem, we implement a specialized tabu search procedure. Computational results on realistic instances show a significant improvement over current practice. ...|$|E
