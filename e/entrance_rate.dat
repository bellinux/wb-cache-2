The nation's high university <b>entrance</b> <b>rate</b> has created a highly skilled workforce making Taiwan one of the most highly educated countries in the world with 68.5% of Taiwanese high school students going on to attend university. Taiwan has a high percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree where 45 percent of Taiwanese aged 25–64 hold a bachelors degree or higher compared with the average of 33 percent among member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). On the other hand, the system has been criticized for placing excessive pressure on students and eschewing creativity in favor of rote memorization. In addition, the system has been criticized for producing an excess supply of over-educated university graduates and a higher unemployment rate. With a large supply of university graduates seeking a limited demand of prestigious white collar jobs in an environment that is increasingly losing its competitive edge has led many degree holders ending up with lower end jobs with salaries far beneath than their expectations. Taiwan’s universities have also been under criticism {{for not being able to}} fully meet the requirements and demands of Taiwan’s 21st century fast-moving job market citing a skills mismatch among a large number of self-assessed overeducated university graduates that don't fit the demands of the modern Taiwanese labor market.

40|$|Abstract — Three {{reversible}} continuous time Markov chain {{models for}} ion channels {{based on the}} reversibility of these biological systems are presented. It is shown that the single ion trans paths {{from left to right}} and those from right to left are equivalent in distribution. This explains an interesting phenomenon observed by biophysicists, that the distribution of time needed for ions to transit an ion channel is the same in either direction, even if there is an electric potential difference across the channel. The distribution of transit time is important in determining the capacity of cell to cell signaling. The first model assumes that there is no interaction between the ions in order to obtain a reversible open system model as the infinite ion limit of a reversible closed system. Then, interaction is brought into the model in two different ways to obtain the doormat model and the floormat model. The <b>entrance</b> <b>rates</b> do not depend on the channel state in the doormat model, but do in the floormat model.

As of 2008, 1640 institutions specifically serve disabled people, with forty-six thousand teaching staff spread across those institutions.In China, {{students with disabilities}} are usually separated from typical classrooms and placed in schools dedicated to special education. The first school dedicated to {{students with disabilities in}} China was established in 1987 in the city of Beijing. Currently this school has 60 staff members who teach more than 200 children in 17 classrooms.

50|$|An oversaturated and overqualified {{labor market}} has {{resulted}} shortages of skilled blue-collar labor {{and a lack}} of qualified vocational employees for small and medium-sized businesses, young South Koreans now realize that a college degree no longer guarantees a job as it once did. With the nation's high university <b>entrance</b> <b>rate,</b> South Korea has produced an overeducated and underemployed labor force with many being unable find employment at the level of their education qualifications. In addition, a subsequent skills surplus has led to an overall decline in labour underutilization in vocational occupations. In the country, 70.9 percent of high school graduates went on to university in 2014, the highest college attendance rate among the Organization for Economic and Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries. In the third quarter of 2016, one out of three unemployed people in South Korea were university graduates largely attributed to the combination of a protracted South Korean economic slowdown and so-called academic inflation. Many young unemployed South Korean university graduates are now turning to vocational education such as skilled trade and technical schools and have simply opted out the national college entrance examination test in favor of entering straight into the workforce. With dire employment prospects for university graduates, enthusiasm for tertiary education has also been waning, as less than 72% of South Korean high-school students went on to university in 2012, a sharp drop from a high of 84.6% in 2008. Other factors that attribute to this include demographic change and the current economic climate as well as financial burdens - particularly the cost of education has gone up dramatically with income growth for college graduates stagnating. According to 2012 employment trend research conducted by Statistics Korea reveals that college graduates earnings are lower than those of high school graduates. Many traditional Korean families still continue to believe that a university education is the only route to a good well paying job in spite mounting evidence to the contrary according to a McKinsey report, noting that the net present value of a university education now trails the value of a high school diploma, due to huge private education costs. The cultural norms of South Korean parents continue to pressure their children to enter university and have even disregarded the phenomenon for declining income of college graduates where the income for university graduates has fallen that below of high school graduates as well as the fact that the unemployment rate for college graduates is higher than that of high-school graduates. The country has also produced an oversupply of university graduates in South Korea where {{in the first quarter of}} 2013 alone, nearly 3.3 million South Korean university graduates were jobless, leading many graduates overqualified for jobs requiring less education. Further criticism has been stemmed for causing labor shortages in various skilled blue-collar labor vocational occupations, where many of which go unfilled. With labor shortages in many skilled labor and vocational occupations, South Korean small and medium-sized businesses complain that they struggle to find enough skilled blue-collar workers to fill potential vocational job vacancies. Despite strong criticism and research statistics pointing alternative career options such as vocational school often with good pay and greater employment prospects that rival the income and prospects of many professional jobs requiring a university degree, a number of South Korean parents still continue to pressure their children regardless of their aptitude to enter university rather than go to a vocational school. In 2012, 93% of South Korean parents expected their children to attend university, but as societal attitudes change and reforms in the South Korean education system reform underway, more young South Koreans are starting to believe that they have to do what they like and what they enjoy in order to be happy to achieve success.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{deactivation}} of excited pyrene derivatives by 0 (3) and the bleaching of 9 -substituted anthracene derivatives by 02 (d) {{have been}} studied in micelles, reverse micelles, vesicles and membranes. Quenching rates by oxygen are mostly determined by the diffusion of the oxygen in the dispersion media in small aggregates such as micelles and reverse micelles. Due to differences in the <b>entrance</b> <b>rates,</b> deactivation in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles and cetyl trimethyl ammonium micelles is faster than in the aqueous phase, while the opposite is observed in AOT/ hydrocarbon/water reverse micelles. In larger microphases such as vesicles and membranes, deactivation rates are determined by intrabilayer mobility and concentration. The results obtained in erythrocyte plasma membranes and hepatic microsomes indicate an increased oxygen solubility towards {{the center of the}} membrane interior, and imply that lateral diffusion contributes more than transverse diffusion to the oxygen mobility. Photobleaching rates of anthracene derivatives in microphases are extremely sensitive to the location of the probe. This sensibility is due to gradients in the oxygen concentration and micropolarities inside the microphases. The interplay of these two opposite factors determines the relative reactivity of the substrates considered...|$|R

The only difference is that all mentioned reasons should be discussed from the CRPAs’ points of view. That is, the low market pressure (i.e., low critical condition of the cloud trading market) is translated to the conditions which are caused by high number of trading opponents, low number of competitors, low <b>entrance</b> <b>rate</b> of new competitors, high <b>entrance</b> <b>rate</b> of new trading opponents and high utility level of the negotiator agents of type CRP (because of having good experience in making successful deals in such a favorable market condition which directly affects on the speed of renting out FNSSA_CRPs’ resources). From Figs.  9, 10, and 11, it can be observed that FNSSA_CRPs try to improve the negotiation results (even low) by adopting suitable strategy in dramatic increase in the market pressure and also try to perfectly use the opportunities of having better agreements by adopting suitable strategy in significant decrease in the market pressure.

The procedure is often {{considered one of the}} highest dose diagnostic procedures in clinical use. Despite this, there is minimal use of dosimeters within angiographic catheterisation laboratories due to challenges resulting from their implementation. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare entrance dose delivery across locally commissioned c-arms to assess the need for real-time dosimetry solutions during angiographic procedures. The secondary aim of this study was to establish a calibration method for the MOSkin dosimeter that accurately produces entrance dose values from the clinically sampled beam qualities and energies. The MOSkin is a real-time dosimeter used to measure the skin dose delivered by external radiation beams. The suitability of the MOSkin for measurements in the angiographic catheterisation laboratory was assessed. Measurements were performed using a 30 × 30 × 30 cm 3 PMMA phantom positioned at the rotational isocenter of the c-arm gantry. The MOSkin calibration factor was established through comparison of the MOSkin response to EBT 2 film response. Irradiation of the dosimeters was performed using several clinical beam qualities ranging in energy from 70 to 105 kVp. A total of four different interventional c-arm machines were surveyed and compared using the MOSkin dosimeter. The phantom was irradiated from a normal angle of incidence using clinically relevant protocols, field sizes and source to image detector distance values. The MOSkin was observed to be radiotranslucent to the c-arm beam in all clinical environments. The MOSkin response was reproducible to within 2 % of the average value across repeated measurements for each beam setting. There were large variations in entrance dose delivery to the phantom between the different c-arm machines with the highest observed cine-acquisition <b>entrance</b> dose <b>rate</b> measuring 326 % higher than the lowest measured cine-acquisition <b>entrance</b> dose <b>rate</b> and with the highest measured fluoroscopic <b>entrance</b> dose <b>rate</b> measuring 346 % higher than the lowest measured fluoroscopic <b>entrance</b> dose <b>rate.</b> This comparison of entrance dose delivery across local clinical c-arms demonstrated the disparity in entrance dose delivery across catheterisation laboratories and outlined a need for real-time dose monitoring systems for patients during angiographic procedures. Through use of our calibration method, an average MOSkin calibration of 7. 37 mV/cGy was established. The calibration method allowed entrance dose to be measured across a range of beam energies and beam qualities without the input of the c-arm beam characteristics. This calibration factor was proven to reproduce entrance dose values to within 5 % value of the reference dosimeter’s response, suggesting potential for further studies and utilisation of the dosimeter in this field...|$|R

Observational data and saliva samples were collected from dogs exposed to both experimental settings; behaviour and cortisol concentration levels were used as welfare indicators. Pair housing offered fewer social and environmental stimuli and behavioural analysis showed a significant decrease in locomotor, exploratory, and social behaviour. Cortisol levels show that this parameter varied independently of housing conditions. Although this study found no evidence suggesting that one form of confinement reduced animal welfare more than the other (e. g. in terms of abnormal behaviour, or higher cortisol concentrations), the type of confinement did affect the expression of a variety of behaviours and these variations should not be ignored with respect to housing decisions for long-term shelter dogs...|$|R

40|$|The {{transport}} of Cu(II) ions from an aqueous solution into an aqueous receiving solution through a bulk liquid membrane containing a dithiophosphonate derivative (1) as a carrier was examined. The kinetic parameters were analyzed assuming 2 consecutive, irreversible rst-order reactions. The influence of temperature and stirring rate on the kinetic parameters (k 1, k 2, R max m, tmax, J max d and J max a) was also investigated. The membrane <b>entrance</b> <b>rate,</b> k 1, and the membrane exit rate, k 2, increased with increasing temperature and stirring rate. For the maximum membrane exit flux, Jmaxa, the activation energy was determined from {{the slope of}} the linear Arrhenius relationship to be 8. 70 kcal mol− 1, which indicates that the process is controlled by species diusion...|$|E
40|$|To {{prepare the}} gold {{nanoparticles}} (AuNPs) with uniform sizes, fine morphology, and good monodispersity, a pulsed mixing microfluidic {{system based on}} PZT actuation was presented. The system includes PZT micropump and Y type micromixer. By adjusting voltage (<b>entrance</b> flow <b>rate),</b> pulsed frequency, phase, and other parameters, a variety of mixing modes can be achieved, so as to realize the controllable synthesis of nanoparticles in a certain range. By numerical simulation and analysis, the channel section size, entrance angle, and pulse frequency were optimized. Based on the optimized structure and working parameters, the test prototype has been manufactured in lab, and the related synthesis tests of AuNPs were carried out. The test results indicate that AuNPs with uniform morphology and good monodispersity can be synthesized using the system with the section size (0. 4 [*]mm × 0. 4 [*]mm), the entrance channel angle (60 °) under condition of the pulsed frequency (300 [*]Hz), and the <b>entrance</b> flow <b>rate</b> (4 [*]mL/min). The average diameter and its standard deviation of AuNPs synthesized were 21. 6 [*]nm, 4. 83 [*]nm, respectively. The research work above {{can be applied to}} the fields such as the controlled synthesis of noble metal nanoparticles, biomedicine, and microchemical system...|$|R
40|$|Advances in imaging {{technology}} have facilitated {{the development of}} increasingly complex interventional cardiac equipment. Consequently, {{there is a need}} for definitive equipment requirements. The aim of the study is to assess the performances of different cardiac angiographic systems. A questionnaire was sent to centres participating in SENTINEL Project to collect dosimetry data (typical <b>entrance</b> dose <b>rate</b> in fluoroscopy and imaging mode), image quality evaluations (low and high contrast resolutions) and KAP calibration factors. Results from this survey could contribute to the explanation of patient dose variability in angiographic cardiac procedures and to derive reference levels for cardiac angiographic equipment performance parameters. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Stimuli {{are divided}} into two groups, namely “known in advance” and “unpredictable.” In order to {{distinguish}} the unpredictable stimuli from the stimuli that are known in advance, the stimuli obtained from the <b>entrance</b> stage are <b>rated</b> according to two criteria of importance and uncertainty. The very crucial and certain stimuli are identified, and their possible amounts are expressed.|$|R
