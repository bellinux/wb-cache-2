5|$|The diamond can {{be split}} by a single, well {{calculated}} blow of a <b>hammer</b> <b>to</b> a pointed tool, which is quick, but risky. Alternatively, {{it can be}} cut with a diamond saw, which is a more reliable but tedious procedure.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{travel to}} the Thomas Edison National Historical Park in West Orange, New Jersey, with his {{electric}} <b>hammer</b> <b>to</b> destroy the chair, but Homer notices a poster of Edison comparing himself to Leonardo da Vinci, much like how Homer compared himself to Edison. Feeling a renewed connection to Edison, he decides not to destroy the chair.|$|E
5|$|On October 2010, these {{versions}} {{were given}} alphanumeric designations with the INS/GPS version becoming the SBU-38 (SBU=Smart Bomb Unit), the INS/GPS/IIR version becoming the SBU-54 and the INS/GPS/SALH version becoming the SBU-64; {{the system as}} a whole was renamed <b>Hammer</b> <b>to</b> make it more appealing to export customers.|$|E

5|$|Paper Mario {{combines}} traditional role-playing game (RPG) elements with {{concepts and}} features from the Mario series. For {{the majority of}} the game, the player controls Mario, who can jump and use his <b>hammer</b> <b>to</b> overcome physical obstacles placed in the game's overworld. Many of the game's puzzles and boundaries are based upon the abilities of Mario's partners, who each have a specialised skill required for progression in the game. The player accumulates partners as they advance into different locations; only one partner can accompany Mario in the overworld, although the player can interchange them at any time.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Ludwig {{venture into}} the {{volcanic}} caves to find Trepkos. When they find Firewalker, Trepkos shoots Ludwig {{in the back with}} a flare gun, killing him. He then burns Ludwig's body, as he was infected with the spore as well. Trepkos tells Mulder that after Firewalker returned from its first descent, Erickson pulverized a rock in one of its samples, resulting in his death and the infection of all the scientists immediately surrounding him. Trepkos says that the spore is parasitic in nature, making its hosts pass itself on to others. Meanwhile, in the lab, an infected O'Neil handcuffs herself to Scully to expose her to the spore, forcing Scully to use a <b>hammer</b> <b>to</b> split the chains but to no avail, so she instead protects herself by throwing O'Neil into a sealed chamber and closing the door. A protrusion then bursts out of O'Neil's throat, killing her without spreading the spore to Scully.|$|E
5|$|With no keyboard, the Famicom version {{replaces the}} verb-noun parser with a menu list of {{fourteen}} set commands selectable with the gamepad. This {{is similar to}} the command selection menu system introduced in Yuji Horii's murder mystery adventure game , which was released in 1984, in between the PC and Famicom releases of Portopia. One of the commands on the menu allowed the player to use a point-and-click interface, using the D-pad to move a cursor on the screen in order to look for clues and hotspots. The Famicom version of Portopia also features branching menu selections, which includes using the pointer as a magnifying glass to investigate objects, which is needed to find hidden clues, and as a fist or <b>hammer</b> <b>to</b> hit anything or anyone, which could be used to carry out beatings during suspect interrogations. Additional sequences were also added, notably an underground dungeon maze, with a style similar to role-playing video games.|$|E

25|$|Colt Government Mk. IV Series 80 (1983–present): Introduced an {{internal}} firing pin safety {{and a new}} half-cock notch on the sear; pulling the trigger on these models while at half-cock will cause the <b>hammer</b> <b>to</b> drop. Models after 1988 returned to the solid barrel bushing due to concerns about breakages.|$|E
25|$|With {{the victory}} of the Bolsheviks in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the red flag, with a <b>hammer</b> <b>to</b> symbolize the workers and sickle to symbolize peasants, became the {{official}} flag of Russia, and, in 1923, of the Soviet Union. It remained so until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.|$|E

50|$|The clock rings every fifteen minutes, {{with its}} own bells for such purpose. The {{mechanism}} of the clock automatically sounds the bells by pulling ropes which in turn move <b>hammers</b> <b>to</b> strike the bell.|$|R
50|$|In January 2011 he {{left the}} <b>Hammers</b> <b>to</b> link up with Chris Powell as {{assistant}} manager at Charlton Athletic. On 27 May 2014 Dyer was sacked from Charlton after the appointment of Bob Peeters as manager.|$|R
25|$|The best-known {{application}} is the electric cigarette lighter: pressing the button causes a spring-loaded <b>hammer</b> <b>to</b> hit a piezoelectric crystal, producing a sufficiently high-voltage electric current that flows across a small spark gap, thus heating and igniting the gas. The portable sparkers used to ignite gas stoves work the same way, and {{many types of}} gas burners now have built-in piezo-based ignition systems.|$|E
25|$|The Contender frame has two firing pins, and a {{selector}} on {{the exposed}} <b>hammer,</b> <b>to</b> allow the shooter {{to choose between}} rimfire or centerfire firing pins, or to select a safety position from which neither firing pin can strike a primer. The initial baseline design of the Contender had no central safe position on the hammer, having only centerfire and rimfire firing pin positions, each being selectable through using a screwdriver.|$|E
25|$|The pistol {{is fired}} {{by a single}} action hammer, and has a manual safety switch on the slide. The ambidextrous safety switch rotates a drum {{mechanism}} which sits over the firing pin, causing the firing pin to lock in, which prevents it from moving forward and reduces {{the possibility of the}} gun discharging accidentally. With the safety off, pulling the trigger releases the <b>hammer</b> <b>to</b> fall downward, hitting the firing pin and causing the chambered round to discharge.|$|E
50|$|These were noisy machines, {{especially}} when the cover was raised. Some people were able to create text that used {{the timing of the}} print <b>hammers</b> <b>to</b> generate desired frequencies and actually play music when that text was printed.|$|R

50|$|In his Chôros No. 8, a 1925 {{work for}} two pianos and large orchestra, Heitor Villa-Lobos {{added to his}} score {{instructions}} to the pianist to insert pieces of paper between the strings and the <b>hammers</b> <b>to</b> attain a certain sonority.|$|R
25|$|Thor is {{a superb}} hand-to-hand combatant, and is skilled in armed combat, excelling {{in the use}} of the war hammer, sword, axe and mace. Thor {{possesses}} two items which assist him in combat: the enchanted Belt of Strength, and his signature weapon, the mystical hammer Mjolnir. The first item doubles Thor's strength and endurance while the second is used to control his weather abilities; flight; energy projection and absorption; dimensional travel; matter manipulation and the most powerful of his offensives, the God Blast (which taps into Thor's life force, and has even forced Galactus to flee), the Thermo-blast, and the Anti-Force (which counteracts another force). Using Mjolnir by throwing it in the desired direction and then holding on to the handle's leather loop, Thor can fly at supersonic speeds in Earth's atmosphere and travel faster than light in space. He can also use the <b>hammer</b> <b>to</b> create a barrier by letting it spin in a circle, and even managed to contain an explosion powerful enough to destroy a 1/5th of the universe, although at the cost of his own life. He can throw an object out of Earth's atmosphere by using his strength, and throw his <b>hammer</b> <b>to</b> Asgard from which it will return.|$|E
25|$|More {{advanced}} improvised guns {{can make}} use of parts from other gun-like products. One example is the cap gun. A cap gun can be disassembled, and a barrel added, turning the toy gun into a real one; a firing pin can then {{be added to the}} <b>hammer,</b> <b>to</b> concentrate the force onto the primer of the cartridge. If the cap gun has a strong enough hammer spring, the existing trigger mechanism can be used as-is; otherwise, rubber bands may be added to increase the power of the hammer.|$|E
25|$|Certain revolvers, called double-action-only (DAO) or, more {{correctly}} {{but less}} commonly, self-cocking, lack the latch {{that enables the}} <b>hammer</b> <b>to</b> be locked to the rear, and thus can only be fired in the double-action mode. With no way to lock the hammer back, DAO designs tend to have bobbed or spurless hammers, and may even have the hammer completely covered by the revolver's frame (i.e., shrouded or hooded). These are generally intended for concealed carrying, where a hammer spur could snag when the revolver is drawn. The potential reduction in accuracy in aimed fire is offset by the increased capability for concealment.|$|E
