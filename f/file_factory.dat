[...] It Providence was the hub of the nation's most industrialized state, an early-day Silicon Valley of cutting-edge technology. The city boasted its [...] "five industrial Wonders of the World" [...] - the largest precision-tool factory (Brown & Sharpe), the largest <b>file</b> <b>factory</b> (Nicholson File), the largest steam-engine factory (Corliss), the largest silverware factory (Gorham), and the largest screw factory (American Screw) - plus the country's biggest textile manufacturer, Fruit of the Loom.|$|E
50|$|Forest Hill {{is located}} on a ridge between the Passaic River and {{the valley of the}} Branch Brook. It was first {{developed}} by Elias Heller, who owned a <b>file</b> <b>factory</b> in North Newark, on the Belleville border. Heller Parkway is named in his honor. From the 1870s to the 1920s, generations of wealthy Newarkers built hundreds of stately homes in the area in various styles, including Beaux-Arts, Victorian, Colonial Revival, Gothic Revival, and Spanish Revival. Along with their mansions, the wealthy of Forest Hill also developed scores of social and literary clubs. Other than the homes, landmarks include the old Tiffany factory. The Branch Brook branch of the Newark Public Library serves the neighborhood.|$|E

5000|$|Adding new {{concrete}} types {{is done by}} {{modifying the}} client code to use a different factory, a modification that is typically one line in one <b>file.</b> The different <b>factory</b> then creates objects of a different concrete type, but still returns a pointer of the same abstract type as before [...] - [...] thus insulating the client code from change. This is significantly easier than modifying the client code to instantiate a new type, which would require changing every location in the code where a new object is created (as well as making sure that all such code locations also have knowledge of the new concrete type, by including for instance a concrete class header <b>file).</b> If all <b>factory</b> objects are stored globally in a singleton object, and all client code goes through the singleton to access the proper factory for object creation, then changing factories {{is as easy as}} changing the singleton object.|$|R

FACT was reserved for full-length albums, while FAC was used for both single song releases and many other Factory [...] "productions", including: posters (FAC 1 advertised a club night), The Haçienda (FAC 51), a lawsuit <b>filed</b> against <b>Factory</b> Records by Martin Hannett (FAC 61), a hairdressing salon (FAC 98), a broadcast of Channel 4's The Tube TV series (FAC 104), customised packing tape (FAC 136), a bucket on a restored watermill (FAC 148), the Haçienda cat (FAC 191), a bet between Wilson and Gretton (FAC 253), a radio advertisement (FAC 294), and a website (FAC 421). Similar numbering was used for compact disc media releases (FACD), Factory Benelux releases (FAC BN or FBN), Factory US releases (FACTUS), and Gap Records Australia releases (FACOZ), with many available numbers restricted to record releases and other directly artist-related content.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reflects}} a collaborative, research led design project, aiming {{to explore the}} potentials offered by incorporating parametric / generative tools and performative lighting simulation software in order {{to design and fabricate}} a small pavilion for the School of Architecture. The Deceptive Landscape pavilion was designed in the framework of a masters level, research led, and collaborative design studio. During its intense 12 weeks schedule, student teams were asked to explore and apply generative / parametric tools such as Rhino and Grasshopper, in order to design and later construct a small pavilion, with a theme of their choice. In addition, each team was asked to optimise their design proposal by embedding environmental software plug-ins (e. g. DIVA for Rhino) in their design process, thereby aiming to re-inform their parametric models and set performance targets. Finally each team was expected to propose a <b>file</b> to <b>factory</b> fabrication technique, following all constrains of a limited, predetermined budget. The most convincing and consistent proposal, was then chosen for fabrication. The finalised project serves as verification of the effectiveness of the design system and teaching methods used...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{the final stage of}} a {{research}} project with the realization of a real scale prototype and ties an empirical finale to the project, which started as a fundamental research project three years ago. The scope of this research project was to explore new ways, how Non-Standard Architecture can be build with standard building elements using contemporary building processes and materials resource efficiently. Mass Customization and <b>File</b> to <b>Factory,</b> concepts where a continuous digital workflow is applied, were fundamental to our approach. Within this framework we developed generic parametric details and made them part of the whole process {{from the beginning of the}} design to the manufacturing. The present paper describes a strategy for the assembly of a large prototype, consisting of approximately 50 flat timber panels that are being assembled to a structure of the size of a small house. The paper focuses especially on the customized falsework, we designed for the construction of the prototype, which became a crucial part of the assembling process besides the assembly of the actual prototype...|$|R
50|$|The building’s design {{takes into}} account the need to passively {{ventilate}} the space. The form of the building and its location in open space makes it easy to take advantage of cross ventilation that is achieved through shading fins that allow hot air to escape while protecting against the rain and reducing the need for active heating and air conditioning systems (HVAC). The building’s structure utilizes a low maintenance steel that is fully concealed within the building’s shell as are all of the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems. The Pavilion was pre-fabricated and hauled onto the site where it was pieced together along with its steel structure that was created through a <b>file</b> to <b>factory</b> process. Despite the attempt at sustainability of this structure the costs are considerable and some of the materials used are questionable. The carbon footprint of some of the materials such as polyuria (commonly used in the making of spandex) and corian (made up of acrylic polymer and alumina trihydrate) used in the building’s interior are questionable in regards to sustainability.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{world around}} us is evolving. We are living inside evolution. As a {{practicing}} architect I find nothing more natural than to look around me and implement relevant changes into my own profession. Taking this seriously means implementing new digital technologies in {{the very fabric of}} design methods, from the first conceptual thought and from the first accurately described design proposal. Mass production is soon to be overhauled by the principles of customization, in the form of both industrial mass customization and in the form of distributed small scale household fabrication. Customization, which is the modern made to measure, will change architecture from its very foundations. A completely new esthetic will be the natural outcome of the digital parametric design process that connects the <b>file</b> to <b>factory</b> CNC production methods— a new kind of beauty for a new kind of building. Complexity based on simple rules characterizes the dramatic paradigm shift from mass production to customization. The new kind of building is complex yet systemic in its design method. The new kind of building dramatically enhances the potential of today's architectural expression while keeping strict control on its data, including costs. Truly nonstandard architecture is cost-effective and simply complex...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{production}} of Shelby GTs in the USA had ceased, {{a total of}} nine 1971 [...] "Shelby Europa" [...] GT-350 and GT-500 Mustangs were produced under license by Belgian dealer Claude Dubois for the European market. 7 Fastbacks (Ford used the term Sportsroof) and 2 convertibles were produced; of which 7 were M-code and 1 H-code cars. One 429SCJ J-code Fastback was produced, though its whereabouts today are unknown. Both convertibles and 1 fastback were modified to GT-500 with 351-HO. All 1971 Shelby Europas were based on 1971 Mustang, none on 1972 Mustang. Previously {{it was believed that}} 14 cars were produced, but the total production number of 9 cars was confirmed in 2014 by cross-check of Claude Dubois' <b>files</b> and Ford <b>Factory</b> Mustang production data.|$|R

The cupolas were added for the production of cast-iron products, which Allaire was able to manufacture {{as a result of the}} surplus pig iron from the Works. [...] His company manufactured items including pots, pans, skillets, kettles and other holloware; along with andirons, pipes, tools and machine castings.

40|$|Abstract—Android phone {{manufacturers}} {{are under the}} per-petual pressure to move quickly on their new models, continu-ously customizing Android to fit their hardware. However, the security implications of this practice are less known, {{particularly when it comes}} to the changes made to Android’s Linux device drivers, e. g., those for camera, GPS, NFC etc. In this paper, we report the first study aimed at a better understanding of the security risks in this customization process. Our study is based on ADDICTED, a new tool we built for automatically detecting some types of flaws in customized driver protection. Specifically, on a customized phone, ADDICTED performs dynamic analysis to correlate the operations on a security-sensitive device to its related Linux files, and then determines whether those files are under-protected on the Linux layer by comparing them with their counterparts on an official Android OS. In this way, we can detect a set of likely security flaws on the phone. Using the tool, we analyzed three popular phones from Samsung, identified their likely flaws and built end-to-end attacks that allow an unprivileged app to take pictures and screenshots, and even log the keys the user enters through touchscreen. Some of those flaws are found to exist on over a hundred phone models and affect millions of users. We reported the flaws and helped the manufacturers fix those problems. We further studied the security settings of device <b>files</b> on 2423 <b>factory</b> images from major phone manufacturers, discovered over 1, 000 vulnerable images and also gained insights about how they are distributed across different Android versions, carriers and countries.
