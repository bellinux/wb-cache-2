It is thought that this was done to make the building appear as if it were constructed of masonry, and this may have been a reaction to the BCC ordinances, introduced soon after the building's construction, concerning <b>fire-resistant</b> <b>construction.</b> The rear stair was also enclosed with timber lattice at this time.|$|E
50|$|The Donaghey Building is a {{historic}} commercial building at 103 East 7th Street and 703 South Main Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. It is a fourteen story structure, built out of reinforced concrete and faced in brick. The building forms a U shape, with a central courtyard open to the south. It was built in 1925-26 to a design by New York City architect Hunter McDonnell, and was Little Rock's tallest building for three decades, housing a variety of commercial offices, and retail spaces on the ground floor. It featured the latest advances in lighting, ventilation, and <b>fire-resistant</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|E
50|$|Similarly, {{one reason}} for the lack of success in {{creating}} a true firestorm in the bombing of Berlin in World War II was that the building density, or builtupness factor, in Berlin was too low to support easy fire spread from building to building. Another reason was that much of the building construction was newer and better than in most of the old German city centers. Modern building practices in the Berlin of World War II led to more effective firewalls and <b>fire-resistant</b> <b>construction.</b> Mass firestorms never proved to be possible in Berlin. No matter how heavy the raid or what kinds of firebombs were dropped, no true firestorm ever developed.|$|E
50|$|The Joelma Building is a {{reinforced}} <b>fire-resistant</b> concrete hull <b>construction.</b> So, {{the structure}} itself {{did not suffer}} enough damage from the fire to cause a collapse. However, the interior was furnished with flammable items. Partitions, desks and chairs were made of wood. The ceilings were cellulose fiber tiles set in wood strappings. The curtains and carpets were also flammable.|$|R
50|$|The frame {{needs to}} be {{protected}} from fire because steel softens at high temperature and this can cause the building to partially collapse. In the case of the columns this is usually done by encasing it in some form of fire resistant structure such as masonry, concrete or plasterboard. The beams may be cased in concrete, plasterboard or sprayed with a coating to insulate it from the heat of the fire or it can be protected by a <b>fire-resistant</b> ceiling <b>construction.</b> Asbestos was a popular material for fireproofing steel structures up until the early 1970s, before the health risks of asbestos fibres were fully understood.|$|R

50|$|The {{house was}} built in 1915-16 by Albert Bissell for Arthur Perkins, owner of the Rutland Fire Clay Company, whose plant, then located just to the east, had been built out of fire {{resistant}} materials by Bissell five years earlier. Perkins' father founded the company in 1872, at first processing low-grade iron ore, but shifting to clay when the mines proved a better source of that material. Perkins took over the firm in 1898. The company plant was destroyed by fire in 1902, and its replace also succumbed to fire in 1910, sparking Perkins' interest in <b>fire-resistant</b> <b>construction</b> methods. The house's exterior is built largely out of such materials, with major structural elements of its porches made of concrete poured in place. Perkins served as mayor of Rutland 1927-35.|$|E
5000|$|The {{details of}} layout and {{construction}} of electrical rooms will be controlled by local building code and electrical code regulations. Requirements for an electrical room relate to fire safety and electrical hazards. An electrical room is usually required to be secured from access by unauthorized persons; these rules are especially strict where equipment within the room has exposed live terminals. Regulations may require two separate means of exit from a room where the power rating of circuits exceeds some threshold, to allow for quick exit in an emergency. [...] Rooms containing oil-filled equipment {{may be required to}} have <b>fire-resistant</b> <b>construction</b> or active fire suppression equipment in the room and may be designated as an electrical vault. Since power distribution often requires large numbers of electrical cables, special measures for fire resistance of cables and cable trays may be also specified by regulations.|$|E

It is, however, frequently necessary to resort to largely non-combustible construction in order to achieve substantial fire endurance (i. e. a long fire resistance time). The fire resistance or fire endurance of a structural element is universally defined in terms of the length of time it will meet certain requirements when e,(posed in a test furnace that follows a specified time-temperature curve. For a particular building the fire endurance requirements are in turn related to the fire load within it...|$|E
40|$|Through a {{partnership}} with Unitika Ltd., NASA's Langley Research Center created a foam based on high temperature resistant polyimide chemistry. Licensed non-exclusively to SORDAL, Inc., the low-density foam, named TEEK, can be processed into forms or used to fill structures such as honeycomb. TEEK offers superior insulation and support qualities, with heat and flame resistance abilities. TEEK is a practical selection for hull insulation in the shipbuilding industry, with numerous potential applications in aerospace applications, <b>fire-resistant</b> <b>construction</b> materials, and {{a wide range of}} consumer products that will improve safety and energy efficiency. Other opportunities are available in the areas of automotive coatings and sealants, electrical components, and recreational equipment. SORDAL has introduced its new product in several different forms, under the name "SOLREX".

40|$|Concrete is {{recognized}} {{for being a}} <b>fire-resistant</b> <b>construction</b> material. At elevated temperatures concrete can, however, undergo considerable damage such as strength degradation, cracking, and explosive spalling. In recent decades, reuse of fire-damaged concrete structures by means of developing techniques to repair the degraded material has gained interest amongst researchers. Autogenic self-healing methods such as re-curing in water has proven to partly restore the strength of concrete. The extent of restoration is dependent upon various parameters such as concrete type, exposure temperature, and post-fire curing conditions for example. The use of selfcompacting/ consolidating concrete (SCC) has become common {{in the construction industry}} due to its high workability and low permeability. This paper presents the results of an experimental study aimed at investigating the improved mechanical properties of high temperature exposed SCC concrete by the autogenic self-healing phenomenon resulting from water re-curing. The residual mechanical properties including strength, modulus of elasticity and ultimate strain of the material upon application of different post-fire curing regimes are presented herein with special emphasis on the effect of thermal profile including exposure time, temperature and cooling rate. The experimental results confirm that the recovery of material properties in fire-damaged SCC concrete is contingent on the post-fire water curing conditions. Materials and Environmen...|$|E
40|$|High-rise {{buildings}} in many big {{cities in the}} Far East, including Hong Kong, call for refuge floors {{as a matter of}} both practicality and compliance with regulations. Even though many countries fire codes are not clear in spelling out the necessity for refuge floors, it is accepted within construction that such floors are essential in resisting fire, allowing users a means of escape and allowing emergency services a means of access to stricken buildings. This paper discusses the reasons behind providing refuge floors, while also considering related fire safety provisions, such as their enclosure behind <b>fire-resistant</b> <b>construction</b> or the protection of their openings behind a water curtain. Our discussion takes a tall building with balconies as a test example of refuge floors, running a hazard assessment based on Computational Fluid Dynamics assuming a fire of the broadly accepted level of 2 MW. The paper concludes that the design of the buildings façade finally determines whether or not a refuge floor and associated fire safety provisions, such as a water curtain, can be waived. As the flat modelled used to store a high amount of combustibles up to 1135 MJm- 2, the breaking of large area of glass window could lead to a major conflagration. The consequences of a scenario with a fire of 25 MW are also discussed. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Fire {{has been}} always {{a major concern}} for {{designers}} of steel and concrete structures. Designing fire-resistant structural elements {{is not an easy}} task due to several limitations such as the lack of <b>fire-resistant</b> <b>construction</b> materials. Concrete reinforcement cover and external insulation are the most commonly adopted systems to protect concrete and steel from overheating, while spalling of concrete is minimised by using HPFRC instead of standard concrete. Although these methodologies work very well for low rise concrete structures, {{this is not the case}} for high-rise and inaccessible buildings where fire loading is much longer. Fire can permanently damage structures that cost a lot of money. This is unsafe and can lead to loss of life. In this research, the author proposes a new type of main reinforcement for concrete structures which can provide better fire-resistance than steel or FRP re-bars. This consists of continuous braided fibre rope, generally made from fire-resistant materials such as carbon or glass fibre. These fibres have excellent tensile strengths, sometimes in excess of ten times greater than steel. In addition to fire-resistance, these ropes can produce lighter and corrosive resistant structures. Avoiding the use of expensive resin binders, fibres are easily bound together using braiding techniques, ensuring that tensile stress is evenly distributed throughout the reinforcement. In order to consider braided ropes as a form of reinforcement it is first necessary to establish the mechanical performance at room temperature and investigate the pull-out resistance for both unribbed and ribbed ropes. Ribbing of ropes was achieved by braiding the rope over a series of glass beads. Adhesion between the rope and concrete was drastically improved due to ribbing, and further improved by pre-stressing ropes and reducing the slacked fibres. Two types of material have been considered for the ropes: carbon and aramid. An implicit finite element approach is proposed to model braided fibres using Total Lagrangian formulation, based on the theory of small strains and large rotations. Modelling tows and strands as elastic transversely isotropic materials was a good assumption when stiff and brittle fibres such as carbon and glass fibres are considered. The rope-to-concrete and strand-to-strand bond interaction/adhesion was numerically simulated using newly proposed hierarchical higher order interface elements. Elastic and linear damage cohesive models were used effectively to simulate non-penetrative 'free' sliding interaction between strands, and the adhesion between ropes and concrete respectively. Numerical simulation showed similar de-bonding features when compared with experimental pull-out results of braided ribbed rope reinforced concrete...|$|E
