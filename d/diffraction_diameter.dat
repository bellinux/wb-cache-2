40|$|Laser {{diffraction}} (LD) and {{static image}} analysis (SIA) of rectangular particles [United States Pharmacopeia, USP 30 -NF 25, General Chapter, Optical Miroscopy. ] have been systematically studied. To rule out sample dispersion and particle orientation as {{the root cause}} of differences in size distribution profiles, we immobilize powder samples on a glass plate by means of a dry disperser. For a defined region of the glass plate, we measure the diffraction pattern as induced by the dispersed particles, and the 2 D dimensions of the individual particles using LD and optical microscopy, respectively. We demonstrate a correlation between LD and SIA, with the scattering intensity of the individual particles as the dominant factor. In theory, the scattering intensity is related to the square of the projected area of both spherical and rectangular particles. In traditional LD the size distribution profile is dominated by the maximum projected area of the particles (A). The diffraction diameters of a rectangular particle with length L and breadth B as measured by the LD instrument approximately correspond to spheres of diameter ØL and ØB respectively. Differences in the scattering intensity between spherical and rectangular particles suggest that the contribution made to the overall LD volume probability distribution by each rectangular particle is proportional to A 2 /L and A 2 /B. Accordingly, for rectangular particles the scattering intensity weighted <b>diffraction</b> <b>diameter</b> (SIWDD) explains an overestimation of their shortest dimension and an underestimation of their longest dimension. This study analyzes various samples of particles whose length ranges from approximately 10 to 1000 μm. The correlation we demonstrate between LD and SIA can be used to improve validation of LD methods based on SIA data for a variety of pharmaceutical powders all with a different rectangular particle size and shape...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: A new inhaler (Medspray(R)) for {{pulmonary}} {{drug delivery}} {{based on the}} principle of Rayleigh break-up has been tested with three different spray nozzles (1. 5; 2. 0 and 2. 5 mu m) using aqueous 0. 1 % (w/w) salbutamol and 0. 9 % (w/w) sodium chloride solutions.

Results: The Medspray(R) inhaler exhibits a highly constant droplet size distribution in the aerosol during dose emission.

30|$|The light {{collection}} optics should maximize {{the number of}} photons captured from the photon stream directed towards the satellite by the OGS. Ideally, the OGS produces a <b>diffraction</b> limited beam <b>diameter</b> of a little over 1 meter {{at the location of}} the satellite for the 808  nm quantum channel; in practice increased to several meters due to atmospheric turbulence.

The structure, crystallite size and inversion parameter were determined by x-ray <b>diffraction.</b> The crystallite <b>diameter</b> of the as-prepared powders ranged from 6. 5 to 8. 5 nm. The minimum size was achieved for the samples with 0. 25 =x= 0. 50. After annealing the crystallite size increased by an average of 3 nm. The values of the inversion parameters, before and after annealing, reflect roughly the chemical preference of Zn cations to the tetrahedral sites and Mg cations to the octahedral sites of the spinel structure. However, these values indicate that the as-prepared materials were not in the equilibrium state. The magnetic properties were studied by 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy over a temperature range of 25 K to room temperature. Taking advantage of their sensitivity to the superparamagnetic behavior induced by the size effects, the Mössbauer spectra were used to determine the blocking temperatures.

40|$|Micro-cylinders {{with the}} diameters {{spanning}} the 1 - 20 μm range are growing in importance, for realizing devices with new functionalities. For custom functionalities, their device-designs impose, tolerance-related constraints on their critical dimension. To {{meet the challenges}} for the associated online micro-metrology, new methods for the micro-cylinder diameter measurement, are currently receiving considerable attention. „Optical diffraction under Fraunhofer Approximation‟ {{is one of the}} most viable experimental techniques for cylinder diameter measurement, in the laboratory as well as Industrial environment. In 1 - 20 μm diameter range, however, the cylinder-diffraction is not well understood. The reliability of the current models/formulations for this range is far from satisfactory in respect of speed, accuracy, resolution etc., and need a re-examination. The present thesis concerns with a few investigations on the „Optical Diffraction by Micro-Cylinder‟. It highlights both the theoretical and the experimental aspects of the investigations on micro-cylinders with diameters in the range of 1 - 50 μm. The results of the investigation are organized into two categories. The first of them details a pair of new analytical models obtained from the principles of „Geometrical Theory of Micro-Cylinder Diffraction‟ while the second category highlights another pair of new analytical models obtained from the principles of the „Customary Fraunhofer Theory of Micro-Cylinder Diffraction‟. The model from the „geometrical theory‟ is based on the hypothesis that the ‘ray-paths relevant to the location of ‘diffraction minima’, facilitate to construct, a geometrically-equivalent triangle’. The solution of such a triangle provides the new formulation for the micro-cylinder diffraction. The model from the „customary Fraunhofer theory‟, instead, relies on the on the fact that „the diffraction pattern for a micro-cylinder is essentially, a chirped-interference pattern modulated by a diffraction envelope’. The functional form of the formulation depends upon, the type of triangle constructed for geometrical theory and the type of illumination used in the customary Fraunhofer theory. The thesis highlights, four new formulations (two from each of the approaches) to describe the micro-cylinder diffraction. The principal conclusions of the investigations are as under. - All the new formulations for the micro-cylinder <b>diffraction</b> facilitate, enhanced <b>diameter</b> inversion accuracy, in the hitherto esoteric diameter range of 1 - 20 μm. For the reported experimental data on 3 μm diameter micro-cylinder, the models proposed in the present investigation improve the accuracy of diameter-estimation from 16. 5 % known from earlier models to less than 1 %. - The investigation also brings out for the first time, the hitherto unnoticed difference between slit-diffraction and the micro-cylinder diffraction: When the micro-cylinder diameter approaches the wavelength of the illumination, the first order diffraction angle approaches nearly 200. It may be noted that for a slit of same width, the corresponding diffraction angle approaches 900. When the critical dimension of the cylinder and the slit decreases from λ to 5 λ, the difference in the corresponding diffraction angles reduce from nearly 700 to nearly 1. 50. - The investigation also highlights that in the micro-cylinder diffraction for the said range of interest, the absolute intensity at the zero-order interference- maximum provides a new signature for the distance of separation between the diffraction minima. The consequence of this new finding is a considerable simplification in the apparatus and algorithm for diameter inversion from a diffraction experiment. The function of an array detector can be replaced by a point detector at a fixed point for all the diameters in the range of interest. - The two formulations proposed from the geometrical theory are suited for diffraction- minima search based algorithm, while those from customary Fraunhofer theory are well suited for intensity minima search based method for diameter inversion...|$|R
