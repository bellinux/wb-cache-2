40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine how the interviewed {{teachers}} in one school observe their view of <b>gender</b> and <b>equality</b> regarding the educational system.   Accordingly, I would like to present my intention with this study, also be to analyze how the interviewed teachers way of working with matters of <b>gender</b> and <b>equality,</b> carry out as a portrait of their values considering the distribution in terms of gender.

How do different teachers talk about their way of working in relation to <b>gender</b> and <b>equality</b> in school? How is boys and girls images presented in the teachers descriptions in their discussion about <b>gender</b> and <b>equality?</b> This study is based on a fundamental qualitative method, where a handful number of teacher’s from one school were interviewed in order to obtain information and data for the examination.

The conclusions of this study can be presented by the teacher’s intentions in balancing the matter of gender in relation to equality. All interviewers share a common view that these matters concerning <b>gender</b> and <b>equality</b> should be recognized and emphasized in the teacher’s work with the students. Additionally, due to the complex relationship between <b>gender</b> and <b>equality,</b> do the teachers there for base their work on the comprehension that the concepts of <b>gender</b> and <b>equality</b> have the same meaning and for this reason also share a similar significance. The interviewed teachers aspire to work on a solution to the issues of <b>gender</b> and <b>equality,</b> by focusing their work in situating the individual in the main center with the purpose to establish a sexless platform for each and every individual...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, gender and {{politics}} {{has become a}} vibrant and recognised international research field. Scholars have shown that gender is central to politics. <b>Gendered</b> <b>equalities</b> and inequalities are shaped and reproduced in political processes and institutions. In this article, we examine to what extent gender perspectives and insights are currently integrated in Dutch political science education. Based on a systematic analysis of the Bachelor programmes offered by the four Dutch political science departments, we demonstrate that gender is marginal in the foundational compulsory part of the curriculum. Additionally, students read very little scholarly work written by women. We argue that a gender perspective {{should be part of}} the analytical toolkit of anyone trained as a political scientist. Therefore, we collected suggestions of internationally renowned gender and politics scholars. This resulted in a comprehensive list with key concepts and readings that can be readily integrated in the core courses of political science on: comparative politics, international relations, methodology, political theory, and public policy...|$|R

Swaminarayan also directed male devotees not to listen to religious discourses given by women.|$|E

40|$|Although Internet {{pornography}} is widely consumed and researchers {{have started to}} investigate its effects, we still know little about its content.

We conducted a content analysis of three main dimensions of <b>gender</b> (in) <b>equality</b> (i. e., objectification, power, and violence) in 400 popular pornographic Internet videos from the most visited pornographic Web sites. Objectification was depicted more often for women through instrumentality, but men were more frequently objectified through dehumanization. Regarding power, men and women {{did not differ in}} social or professional status, but men were more often shown as dominant and women as submissive during sexual activities. Except for spanking and gagging, violence occurred rather infrequently. Nonconsensual sex was also relatively rare. Overall, amateur pornography contained more gender inequality at the expense of women than professional pornography did...|$|R
40|$|Feminist theorists Alicia Ostriker and Phyllis Trible {{argue that}} as a nonpatriarchal text free of gendered {{hierarchy}} and sexual stereotyping, the Song of Songs is the most prominent example of countertext in the Hebrew Bible. In challenging such theorists, I argue that the Song depicts not a utopia of <b>gendered</b> <b>equality,</b> but an empowered female protagonist resistant to the surrounding patriarchal society, which functions similarly to social order throughout much of biblical literature. Patriarchy in the Song {{is evidenced by the}} consistent assertion of male dominance through male regulation of the Shulamite’s sexuality, and the dehumanization of the female body. The Shulamite is not a liberated female figure but instead an active combatant to the forces of patriarchy which seek to control her. In critiquing these forces within the Song, we can both complicate an idealized depiction of the Shulamite, and identify the social barriers that limit her liberation and necessitate her radical resistance...|$|R

The choice of indicators has been based on the study made by the Department of Applied Economics of the Free University of Brussels (DULBEA) for the Belgian government. This paper presents the main results of this study. In a first part the context of the building of indicators is shaped. The second part of the paper deals with the data set available for building indicators. The third part is devoted to the presentation and discussion of most of the indicators that were proposed, and finally, in the fourth part some recommendations for the improving of the existing and future databases are made. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
