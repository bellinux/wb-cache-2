40|$|<b>Infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> is {{an acute}} viral disease with high {{contagious}} and mortality among chicks. The {{aim of this}} study was to survey of relation between ascites syndrome incidence and <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> in broiler chickens by ELISA method in Iran. Eight Ross strain broiler farm affected by <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> were selected in this study. Blood samples were gathered early stages of disease and blood sampling was repeated two times with seven days interval. ELISA serologic test was used for approving the determination of <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> In addition, in order to differential diagnosis of Newcastle and influenza (H 9 N 2) some relevant experiments were conducted. The rate of mortality in any farm during rearing, autopsy and the cause of mortality were recorded. Ascites cases were calculated in terms of prevalence. The growth parameters, FCR, final weight, total consumption of grain at each farm were calculated and mentioned. Based on obtained results in this study, the mean rate of mortality caused by ascites syndrome has been increased meaningfully in herds affected by <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> compared with control group. In eight understudied farms affected by <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> the mean rate of Ascites mortality was 3 % such that the mean rate of Ascites mortality was 0. 5 % at previous periods. Based on relevant results also final weight mean in affected herds with <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> was lower compared with previous periods. Meanwhile, FCR in affected herds with <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> was high compared with healthy herds. In this research demonstrated that there is positive correlation between <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> and Ascites syndrome and the correlation is significant (p< 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Infectious</b> <b>Bronchitis</b> is {{an acute}} and highly {{contagious}} viral respiratory disease of chickens characterized by gasping, coughing, tracheal rales and nasal discharge. Infected chickens have congestion in trachea and lungs with caseous exudates exudates in the trachea in post mortem examination. Ascites syndrome {{is a significant}} cause of mortality in broiler chickens. Gross lesions of this syndrome are cardiac enlargement, hydropericard and ascites. <b>Infectious</b> <b>Bronchitis</b> virus induces repiratory damage and causes ascites in broilers. In this study eight broiler farms that were infected to <b>infectious</b> <b>Bronchitis</b> selected. Blood samples were collected {{at the onset of}} infection and ELISA Test was applied for confirmation of <b>infectious</b> <b>Bronchitis.</b> In each farm autopsy was applied, causes of mortality recorded and also feed conversion ratio, total weight and feed consumption were calculated. The percentage of ascites mortality in chickens that were infected to <b>infectious</b> <b>Bronchitis</b> increased significantly than the control chickens. In eight <b>infectious</b> <b>bronchitis</b> infected famrs, percentage ascites mortality was 3 % and in non-infected chickens was 0. 5 %. Total weight in infected (IB) chickens was significantly lower than in healthy chickens. Feed conversion ratio in infected chickens was higher than healthy chickens. There is a positive correlation between <b>Infectious</b> <b>Bronchitis</b> and the rate of ascites incidence...|$|R
