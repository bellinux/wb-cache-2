25|$|On 29 November, at {{the request}} of Burakov and Fetisov, Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, the {{psychiatrist}} who had written the 1985 psychological profile of the then-unknown killer, was invited to assist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> of the suspect. Bukhanovsky read extracts from his 65-page psychological profile to Chikatilo. Within two hours, Chikatilo burst into tears and confessed to Bukhanovsky that he was indeed guilty of the crimes for which he had been arrested. After conversing into the evening, Bukhanovsky reported to Burakov and Fetisov that Chikatilo was ready to confess.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} before LulzSec disbanded, the FBI {{executed}} a search warrant on an Iowa home rented by Laurelai Bailey. Authorities interviewed her for five hours and confiscated her hard drives, camera, and other electronic equipment, but no charges were filed. Bailey denied {{being a member of}} the group, but admitted chatting with members of LulzSec online and later leaking those chats. The FBI was interested in having her infiltrate the group, but Bailey claimed the members hated her and would never let her <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> <b>questioning</b> by the FBI led a local technical support company to fire Laurelai, claiming she embarrassed the company.|$|E
25|$|After the Dallas Police arrested Oswald and {{collected}} physical {{evidence at the}} crime scenes, they held Oswald at their headquarters for interrogation. All afternoon, they asked Oswald about the Tippit shooting and {{the assassination of the}} President. They intermittently questioned him for approximately 12hours between 2:30p.m., on November 22, and 11a.m., on November 24. Throughout this interrogation, Oswald denied any involvement with either Kennedy's assassination or Patrolman Tippit's murder. Captain Fritz of the homicide and robbery bureau did most of the questioning and kept only rudimentary notes. Days later, he wrote a report of the interrogation from notes he made afterwards. There were no stenographic or tape recordings. Representatives of other law enforcement agencies were also present, including the FBI and the Secret Service, and occasionally participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>questioning.</b> Several of the FBI agents who were present wrote contemporaneous reports of the interrogation.|$|E
50|$|Even after Kailajärvi's disappearance, many {{club members}} still had faith <b>in</b> <b>the</b> club, {{forwarding}} reassuring emails to each other. <b>In</b> March 2009 <b>the</b> biggest Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat {{published an article}} about the wild-running conspiracy theories surrounding WinCapita. Many former members still believed that the club had been legitimate and that the police and the Ministry of the Interior were concealing evidence. It was stressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> report that the chief suspect Hannu Kailajärvi had reportedly already admitted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionings</b> that <b>the</b> operation had been fraudulent.|$|R

50|$|In Kumamoto, Japan, {{a patient}} with leprosy named Matsuo Fujimoto was tried on charges of an {{explosion}} in 1951 and murder <b>in</b> 1952.

500|$|The {{rediscovery of}} H.D. {{began in the}} 1970s, and coincided with the {{emergence}} of a feminist criticism that found much to admire <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> of gender roles typical of her writings. [...] Specifically, those critics who were challenging the standard view of English-language literary modernism {{based on the work of}} such male writers as Pound, Eliot and James Joyce, were able to restore H.D. to a more significant position in the history of that movement. Her writings have served as a model for a number of more recent women poets working in the modernist tradition, including the New York School poet Barbara Guest, the Anglo-American poet Denise Levertov, the Black Mountain poet Hilda Morley and the Language poet Susan Howe. Her influence is not limited to female poets, and many male writers, including Robert Duncan and Robert Creeley, have acknowledged their debt.|$|E
500|$|The court then {{considered}} {{whether the}} accused had taken action that waived those rights. Waiver {{must be a}} free choice with full awareness (Moran v. Burbine). Miranda v. Arizona (the Miranda ruling) states that [...] " [...] heavy burden rests on the government {{to demonstrate that the}} defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel." [...] It was noted that the accused had read and expressed understanding of the rights, and had them read aloud, he had not pleaded lack of understanding, was given time, and therefore knew his rights. Specifically, having read the 5th warning ("you have the right to decide at any time before or during questioning to use your right to remain silent and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are being questioned") he was aware this right was enduring and could be applied at any time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> if he chose, and the police would have to honor the invocation if he did so. The court observed that [...] "olice are not required to rewarn suspects from time to time". That a question is linked to religious beliefs does not cause the reply to be [...] "involuntary". The accused, understanding his rights and that they were capable of invocation at any point, had not chosen to invoke them.|$|E

40|$|This article {{approaches}} {{the establishment of}} the study of masculinity(ies) by understanding it as a contribution of feminism. A short review of pioneering studies is carried out in order to highlight, <b>in</b> particular, <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> of hegemonic masculinity (CONNELL, 1995) and, subsequently, the diffusion of masculinity studies in Brazil is discussed through the debate on the crises of the masculine and the notion of the “new man”, as well as the importance of the historical-social perspective for the comprehension of the new masculine identities...|$|R
25|$|When Bob Woolmer {{was found}} dead in Jamaica, Sarfaraz Nawaz was quick to suggest that he was murdered, even before the postmortem, linking it to {{corruption}} in cricket. He subsequently raised concerns about the safety of Pakistani Cricketers in West Indies, claiming Woolmer and Inzamam were getting threats from the bookies without naming his sources. He requested the involvement of Scotland Yard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> investigations, <b>questioning</b> <b>the</b> credibility of Jamaican police. He also alleged that the match Pakistan lost against West Indies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> World Cup 2007 was fixed.|$|R
2500|$|The Eighth Circuit upheld his {{conviction}} {{five years later}} {{on the grounds that}} [...] "bsent fundamental ambiguity or impreciseness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>questioning,</b> the meaning and truthfulness of the declarant's answer is for the jury." [...] The Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Legal commentator Barry Tarlow distinguishes the case from Bronston, however, by noting that in this case the defendant had more actively misled the questioner, by volunteering a different yet equally erroneous version of the company name.|$|E
2500|$|He {{recorded}} {{sessions with}} a 26-year-old British member, Chris White, {{who had moved}} to England with LaRouche's former partner, Carol Schnitzer. In December 1973 LaRouche asked the couple {{to return to the}} U.S. His followers sent tapes of the subsequent sessions with White to The New York Times as evidence of an assassination plot. According to the Times, [...] "here are sounds of weeping, and vomiting on the tapes, and Mr. White complains of being deprived of sleep, food and cigarettes. At one point someone says 'raise the voltage,' but (LaRouche) says this was associated with the bright lights used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> rather than an electric shock." [...] The Times wrote, [...] "Mr. White complains of a terrible pain in his arm, then LaRouche can be heard saying, 'That's not real. That's in the program'." [...] LaRouche told the newspaper White had been [...] "reduced to an eight-cycle infinite loop with look-up table, with homosexual bestiality." [...] He said White had not been harmed and that a physician—a LaRouche movement member—had been present throughout. White ended up telling LaRouche he had been programmed by the CIA and British intelligence to set up LaRouche for assassination by Cuban exile frogmen.|$|E
60|$|Thank you, {{my dearest}} Mrs. Martin, for your kind sign of {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> note, although I will not praise the stenography of it. I shall be as brief to-day as you, not quite out of revenge, but because I {{have been writing}} to George and am the less prone to activities from having caught cold in an inscrutable manner, and being stiff and sore {{from head to foot}} and inclined to be a little feverish and irritable of nerves. No, it is not of the slightest consequence; I tell you the truth. But I would have written to you the day before yesterday {{if it had not been}} for this something between cramp and rheumatism, which was rather unbearable at first, but yesterday was better, and is to-day better than better, and to-morrow will leave me quite well, if I may prophesy. I only mention it lest you should have upbraided me for not answering your note in a moment, as it deserved to be answered. So don't put any nonsense into Georgie's head--forgive me for beseeching you! I have been very well--downstairs seven or eight times; lying on the floor in Papa's room; meditating the chair, which would have amounted to more than a meditation except for this little contrariety. In a day or two more, if this cool warmth perseveres in serving me, and no Ariel refills me 'with aches,' I shall fulfil your kind wishes perhaps and be out--and so, no more about me!...|$|E

5000|$|Heidegger {{considered}} that language, everyday curiosity, logical systems, and common beliefs obscure Dasein's nature from itself.

Heidegger thus intended the concept of Dasein to provide a stepping stone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> {{of what it means to}} be—to have one's own being, one's own death, one's own truth.|$|E
