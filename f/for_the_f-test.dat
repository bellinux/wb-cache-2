40|$|Abstract-Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a {{non-invasive}} neurophysiological technique {{with high}} temporal resolution. Nevertheless, low {{signal to noise}} ratio may hamper its fullest capability. Many confidence tests already exist to detect strong responses for signals corrupted by noise, and we have explored their use with experimentally obtained MEG signals. We find that the tests demonstrating the most power are the F-test and Rayleigh’s phase coherence test. Due to the strongly non-Gaussian nature of the MEG noise, from both neural and external perspective, a signal which is purely noise often fails the marginal tests by exceeding the number of false positive allowed. A variation of the tests is suggested that ensures the average false positive for a large number of responses, excited at frequencies different than the frequency of interest, is below any desired threshold.

40|$|Alternative fuels for Diesel engines include ester-based fuels (derived {{from sources}} such as rapeseed, {{soybeans}} and palm oil), dimethyl ether, and various synthetic fuels. Use of these fuels could contribute to a cleaner environment, reduce global warming and improve the human health by reducing levels of harmful emissions. One such fuel is Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) fuel, a synthetic fuel that can be produced from coal, natural gas or biomass, the properties of which heavily depend on the catalyst used in its production. Various published {{studies have shown that}} use of F-T fuels could reduce emissions of soot, NOx, HC and CO, to varying degrees, since they have a number of desirable properties, including low sulfur and aromatic contents, high cetane numbers and low density. To further explore <b>the</b> performance of <b>F-T</b> fuels, and <b>the</b> emissions generated when they are used, engine tests were performed at Chalmers in both HCCI and conventional Diesel combustion modes. The engine used in the investigations was a single cylinder, 0. 5 liter, research engine, and the performance of two F-T Diesel fuels derived from natural gas, produced by Statoil in Trondheim, was compared with that of two conventional Diesel fuels (Swedish low sulfur Diesel and European EN 590 Diesel). In HCCI combustion mode the soot emissions were too low for meaningful comparison between the fuels. However, HC and NOx emissions were lower when using <b>the</b> <b>F-T</b> fuels. There were no significant between-fuel differences in emissions of CO and CO 2, or fuel consumption. In HCCI combustion mode, the combustion was phased by using exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), thus there were no between-fuel differences in ignition delay, despite the early injection (which is a key feature of HCCI combustion). However, higher levels of EGR were needed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>F-T</b> fuels than <b>for</b> <b>the</b> standard Diesel fuels, which reduced the thermal efficiency of the engine. In conventional Diesel combustion mode the soot emissions were markedly lower (by up to 30 percent) when using <b>the</b> <b>F-T</b> fuels than when using the already clean Swedish low-sulfur Diesel. Reductions were also found in HC and CO emissions, while CO 2 and fuel consumption values obtained with the different fuels were similar. The high cetane number of <b>the</b> <b>F-T</b> fuels resulted in shorter ignition delays <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pilot injections. A challenge that had to be met before widespread use of F-T fuels could be economically viable was to minimize their production costs. However, these costs have fallen sharply, through a combination of intense research efforts and <b>the</b> construction of <b>F-T</b> plants with high production capacities, and they are now competitive with oil from fossil sources, so long as the price of the latter is higher than $ 25 /barrel. The possibilities of producing Fischer-Tropsch fuels from several feed-stocks and using existing engines without modifications are major advantages with F-T fuels. Moreover, F-T fuels can be blended in any proportions with petroleum-based Diesel, and existing refueling and maintenance infrastructure can be used for vehicles running on them. All these advantages, and the cleanliness of their exhaust gases, make F-T fuels attractive alternative Diesel fuels...|$|R

The objective of Phase I is to determine the feasibility and define <b>the</b> concept <b>for</b> <b>the</b> EECP located at a specific site; develop a Research, Development, and Testing (RD&T) Plan to mitigate technical risks and barriers; and prepare a Preliminary Project Financing Plan. The objective of Phase II is to implement the work as outlined in the Phase I RD&T Plan to enhance the development and commercial acceptance of coproduction technology. The objective of Phase III is to develop an engineering design package and a financing and testing plan for an EECP located at a specific site. The project's intended result is to provide the necessary technical, economic, and environmental information needed by industry to move the EECP forward to detailed design, construction, and operation. The partners in this project are Texaco Energy Systems LLC or TES (a subsidiary of ChevronTexaco), General Electric (GE), Praxair, and Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR) in addition to the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). TES is providing gasification technology and Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) technology developed by Rentech, GE is providing combustion turbine technology, Praxair is providing air separation technology, and KBR is providing engineering. Each of the EECP subsystems was assessed for technical risks and barriers. A plan was developed to mitigate the identified risks (Phase II RD&T Plan, October 2000). Phase II RD&T Task 2. 6 identified as potential technical risks to the EECP the fuel/engine performance and emissions of <b>the</b> <b>F-T</b> diesel fuel products. Hydrotreating <b>the</b> neat <b>F-T</b> diesel product reduces potentially reactive olefins, oxygenates, and acids levels and alleviates corrosion and fuel stability concerns. Future coproduction plants can maximize valuable transportation diesel by hydrocracking <b>the</b> <b>F-T</b> Synthesis wax product to diesel and naphtha. <b>The</b> upgraded neat <b>F-T</b> diesel, hydrotreater F-T diesel, and hydrocracker F-T diesel products would be final blending components in transportation diesel fuel. Phase II RD&T Task 2. 6 successfully carried out fuel lubricity property testing, fuel response to lubricity additives, and hot-start transient emission tests on a neat F-T diesel product, a hydrocracker F-T diesel product, a blend of hydrotreater and hydrocracker F-T diesel products, and a Tier II California Air Resources Board (CARB) -like diesel reference fuel. Only <b>the</b> neat <b>F-T</b> diesel passed lubricity inspection without additive while the remaining three fuel candidates passed with conventional additive treatment. Hot-start transient emission tests were conducted on the four fuels in accordance with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Federal Test Procedure (FTP) specified in Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 86, and Subpart N on a rebuilt 1991 Detroit Diesel Corporation Series 60 heavy-duty diesel engine. Neat F-T diesel fuel reduced oxides of nitrogen (NO{sub x}), total particulate (PM), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and the Soluble Organic Fraction (SOF) by 4. 5 %, 31 %, 50 %, 29 %, and 35 %, respectively, compared to the Tier II CARB-like diesel. <b>The</b> hydrocracker <b>F-T</b> diesel product and a blend of hydrocracker and hydrotreater F-T diesel products also reduced NO{sub x}, PM, HC, CO and SOF by 13 %, 16 % to 17 %, 38 % to 63 %, 17 % to 21 % and 21 % to 39 % compared to the Tier II CARB-like diesel.

The tests focused on burning alternative and conventional fuels and associated blends in CFM 56 -type commercial gas turbine engines. The CFM 56 engine type is the most common engine in the global commercial fleet powering greater than 70 % of the US domestic fleet.

The algorithm includes a newly developed observation operator that diagnoses <b>the</b> landscape <b>F-T</b> state in <b>the</b> GEOS- 5 Catchment land surface model. <b>The</b> <b>F-T</b> analysis is a rule-based approach that adjusts Catchment model state variables in response to binary F-T observations, while also considering forecast and observation errors. A regional observing system simulation experiment was conducted using synthetically generated <b>F-T</b> observations. <b>The</b> assimilation of perfect (error-free) <b>F-T</b> observations reduced <b>the</b> root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of surface temperature and soil temperature by 0. 206 C and 0. 061 C, respectively, when compared to model estimates (equivalent to a relative RMSE reduction of 6. 7 percent and 3. 1 percent, respectively). For a maximum classification error (CEmax) of 10 percent in <b>the</b> synthetic <b>F-T</b> observations, <b>the</b> <b>F-T</b> assimilation reduced <b>the</b> RMSE of surface temperature and soil temperature by 0. 178 C and 0. 036 C, respectively. For CEmax= 20 percent, <b>the</b> <b>F-T</b> assimilation still reduces the RMSE of model surface temperature estimates by 0. 149 C but yields no improvement over the model soil temperature estimates. <b>The</b> <b>F-T</b> assimilation scheme is being developed to exploit planned operational <b>F-T</b> products from <b>the</b> NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission...|$|R

40|$|In applied research, the Schwarz Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and <b>the</b> <b>F-test</b> might yield {{different}} {{inferences about}} the causal relationships being investigated. This paper examines {{the relationship between}} the BIC and the F-tests in the context of Granger-causality tests. We calculate <b>the</b> <b>F-test</b> significance levels {{as a function of the}} model dimensionality and the sample size that would lead to the same conclusion as the BIC. We illustrate that the BIC would reject the null hypothesis of no-causality less often compared to an F-test conducted at five percent significance level for sample sizes above 50 especially when the chosen model dimensionality is small. Putting the philosophical issues aside, we suggest that the decision to choose between <b>the</b> <b>F-test</b> and <b>the</b> BIC should be made in view of <b>the</b> sample size. <b>F-test,</b> Schwarz Bayesian Information Criterion, Model selection, Granger-causality...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} using a Light-Duty, single-cylinder, research engine {{in which the}} emissions, fuel consumption and combustion characteristics of two Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) Diesel fuels derived from natural gas and two conventional Diesel fuels (Swedish low sulfur Diesel and European EN 590 Diesel) were compared. Due to their low aromatic contents combustion with <b>the</b> <b>F-T</b> Diesel fuels resulted in lower soot emissions than combustion with the conventional Diesel fuels. The hydrocarbon emissions were also significantly lower with F-T fuel combustion. Moreover <b>the</b> <b>F-T</b> fuels tended to yield lower CO emissions than the conventional Diesel fuels. The low emissions from <b>the</b> <b>F-T</b> Diesel fuels, and <b>the</b> potential <b>for</b> producing such fuels from biomass, are powerful reason for future interest and research in this field...|$|R
30|$|For all radiotracers, strong {{agreement}} was seen across the model selection criteria. <b>The</b> <b>F-test</b> was considered as the reference, {{as it is}} a frequently used hypothesis test. <b>The</b> <b>F-test</b> confirmed <b>the</b> AIC preferred model in 87 % of all cases. The strongest (but minimal) disagreement across regional TACs was found when comparing AIC with AICC. Despite these regional discrepancies, same preferred kinetic model was obtained using all criteria, with an exception of one FMZ subject.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> Fisher-Tully (<b>F-T)</b> '' 10 Mpc Catalog of Late-Type Galaxies'' {{is remarkably}} complete. Despite the {{considerable}} effort {{that has been}} spent searching for and cataloging low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies, almost no new HI-rich galaxies {{have been added to}} the volume to which <b>the</b> <b>F-T</b> observations were both sensitive [d < 10 (M-HI/ 10 (8. 2) M-.) (5 / 12) Mpc] and intended to be complete (d < 10 Mpc). It has not yet been demonstrated by the new surveys that HI-rich LSB galaxies are not properly represented in this catalog of nearby galaxies. Although new optical surveys are discovering heretofore uncataloged galaxies at greater distances than the depth of <b>the</b> <b>F-T</b> catalog, they do not alter the completeness of <b>the</b> <b>F-T</b> catalog <b>for</b> H I-rich LSB objects. Thus, unless the galaxy population of the local volume is atypical, there is at present no evidence for a significant, new population of gas-rich galaxies that has escaped recognition until now...|$|R
