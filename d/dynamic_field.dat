25|$|Those {{models that}} {{emphasize}} on lexical processes {{can be further}} {{divided into two groups}} based on how attention is allocated in the reading model. The mainstream model E-Z Reader (Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2003), along with older ones like Reader (Just & Carpenter, 1980) and EMMA (Salvucci, 2001) assumes that attention is allocated to only one word sequentially. On the contrary, the SWIFT model assumes that attention in reading is distributed among the currently fixated word and its neighbours. Since attention allocation determines the input stream in these models, difference in attention allocation results in fundamental difference in the subsequent processing and simulation output. E-Z Reader incorporates various lexical properties into a complex structure of interaction between lexical processing, saccade programming and attention shifting; it reproduces the widest range of phenomena in reading behaviours and can be generalised to reading behaviours in elder people, in different languages and in different types of text presentation (Reichle, 2011). In contrast, SWIFT resorts to a <b>dynamic</b> <b>field</b> of parallel activation that stochastically triggers saccade programming, yielding parsimonious simulations of refixation, regression (fixate back to a previous word), and neighbouring effects (how neighbouring words affect the current fixation) (Engbert & Kliegl, 2011). The debate is still on whether attention in reading should be relaxed to more than one word.|$|E

As the dynamic centers come into perfect relation, the mind registers and remembers sensations, and begins consciously to know. But the great field of activity is still and always the <b>dynamic</b> <b>field.</b> When a child learns to walk, it learns almost entirely from the solar plexus and the lumbar ganglion, the cardiac plexus and the thoracic ganglion balancing the upper body.|$|E
60|$|And then, {{when the}} four centers {{of what we}} call the first field of {{consciousness}} are fully active, then it is that the eyes begin to gather their sight, the mouth to speak, the ears to awake to their intelligent hearings; all {{as a result of the}} great fourfold activity of the first <b>dynamic</b> <b>field</b> of consciousness. And then also, as a result, the mind wakens to its impressions and to its incipient control. For at first the control is non-mental, even non-cerebral. The brain acts only as a sort of switchboard.|$|E
40|$|Rewriting a {{previously}} seen dialog between two entities, {{so that it}} is accepted by another entity, is important for many applications including: the protocol replay problem and the NAT rewriting problem. Both problems are instances of a larger problem that we call the dialog rewriting problem. The challenge in dialog rewriting is that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>fields,</b> e. g., hostnames, IP addresses, session identifiers or timestamps, in the original dialog need to be rewritten for the modified dialog to succeed. This is particularly difficult because the protocol used in the original dialog might be unknown. In this paper, our goal is to generate a transformation function {{that can be used to}} rewrite the values of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>fields.</b> For this, we propose binary analysis techniques to solve the main two challenges: 1) how to automatically identify the <b>dynamic</b> <b>fields,</b> and 2) how to automatically rewrite the values in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>fields.</b> We have implemented Rosetta, a system that creates the transformation function using our proposed techniques. Our results show that we are able to identify different types of <b>dynamic</b> <b>fields</b> present in commonly used protocols such as FTP, DNS and ICQ, and that we are able to rewrite the values in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>fields,</b> even when those fields use complex encodings to represent the data, thus enabling the protocol replay and NAT rewriting problem...|$|R

In Second-Order (SO) state, the compressor is suppressing all <b>dynamic</b> <b>fields</b> such as RTP sequence numbers, and sending only a logical sequence number and partial checksum to cause the other side to predictively generate and verify the headers of the next expected packet. In general, FO state compresses all static <b>fields</b> and most <b>dynamic</b> <b>fields.</b> SO state is compressing all <b>dynamic</b> <b>fields</b> predictively using a sequence number and checksum.|$|R

40|$|Event {{detection}} concerns identifying {{occurrence of}} interesting events which are meaningful and understandable. In <b>dynamic</b> <b>fields,</b> {{as time passes}} the attribute of phenomenon varies in spatial locations. Detecting events in <b>dynamic</b> <b>fields</b> requires an approach {{to deal with the}} highly granular data arriving in real time. This paper proposes a spatiotemporal event detection algorithm in <b>dynamic</b> <b>fields</b> which are monitored by wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The algorithm provides a method using probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) in WSNs to cope with the uncertainty of sensor readings. The algorithm incorporates the ability of Markov chains in temporal dependency modelling and Markov random fields theory to model the spatial dependency of sensors in a distributed fashion. Experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm demonstrates that the decentralized approach improves the F 1 -score to 82 % and 29 % better precision than simple threshold technique. In addition, the performance of the algorithm was evaluated and compared with respect to the scalability (in terms of communication complexity). In comparison with the centralized approach the decentralized algorithm can substantially improve the scalability of communication in wireless sensor networks.

We alleviate this problem by using maximum mipmaps, a hierarchical data structure supporting accurate and efficient rendering while simultaneously lowering the pre-computation costs to negligible levels. Furthermore, maximum mipmaps allow for view-dependent level-of-detail rendering.

A new coding algorithm for this simplified <b>dynamic</b> light <b>fields</b> using a modified MPEG 2 algorithm is proposed.

50|$|Field theory also {{includes}} the idea that every person holds a different experience for a situation. This {{is not to say}} that two people's experience of an event will not be similar, but that there will be some difference. This leads to the idea that no two experiences are the same for a person either, as the <b>dynamic</b> <b>field</b> is constantly changing. This is to say that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>field</b> is like a stream, constantly flowing while changing slightly. Another piece of field theory is the idea that no part of a person's field can be viewed as being pointless. Every part of a total field must be viewed as having possible meaning and importance. This must be done regardless of how pointless or non-important the part of the field may seem, it should still be accounted for. The totality of an individual's field seems to have no bounds, as research has shown that even an infant's experience of World War II could possibly affect life later on, due to the change in field. This is a good example of how broad field theory can span, as a person's preconciousness may be altered due to field changes that occurred before any major development.|$|E
