5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential <b>drug</b> <b>interactions</b> involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring <b>drug</b> <b>interactions</b> and preventing injuries from midazolam administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E
5|$|The major {{side effect}} of {{warfarin}} use is bleeding. Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). Many <b>drug</b> <b>interactions</b> can increase the effect of warfarin, also causing an overdose.|$|E
5|$|Individual benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{different}} interactions with certain drugs. Depending on their metabolism pathway, benzodiazepines can be divided roughly into two groups. The largest group consists of those that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and possess significant potential for interactions with other drugs. The other group comprises those that are metabolized through glucuronidation, such as lorazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam, and, in general, have few <b>drug</b> <b>interactions.</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Drug {{pharmacokinetics}} parameters, <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> parameters, and pharmacogenetics {{data have}} been unevenly collected in different databases and published {{extensively in the}} literature. Without appropriate pharmacokinetics ontology and a well annotated pharmacokinetics corpus, {{it will be difficult}} to develop text mining tools for pharmacokinetics data collection from the literature and pharmacokinetics data integration from multiple databases. Description: A comprehensive pharmacokinetics ontology was constructed. It can annotate all aspects of in vitro pharmacokinetics experiments and in vivo pharmacokinetics studies. It covers all drug metabolism and transportation enzymes. Using our pharmacokinetics ontology, a PK-corpus was constructed to present four classes of pharmacokinetics abstracts: in vivo pharmacokinetics studies, in vivo pharmacogenetic studies, in vivo <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> studies, and in vitro <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> studies. A novel hierarchical three level annotation scheme was proposed and implemented to tag key terms, <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> sentences, and <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> pairs. The utility of the pharmacokinetics ontology was demonstrated by annotating three pharmacokinetics studies; and the utility of the PK-corpus was demonstrated by a <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> extraction text mining analysis. Conclusions: The pharmacokinetics ontology annotates both in vitro pharmacokinetics experiments and in viv...|$|R

5|$|Bupropion is metabolized in {{the liver}} by the {{cytochrome}} P450 isoenzyme CYP2B6. It has several active metabolites: R,R-hydroxybupropion, S,S-hydroxybupropion, threo-hydrobupropion and erythro-hydrobupropion, which are further metabolized to inactive metabolites and eliminated through excretion into the urine. Both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion act {{in the liver}} as potent inhibitors of the enzyme CYP2D6, which metabolizes not only bupropion itself but also {{a variety of other}} drugs and biologically active substances. This mechanism creates the potential for a variety of <b>drug</b> <b>interactions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Enzyme {{production}} (transcription and {{translation of}} enzyme genes) {{can be enhanced}} or diminished by a cell in response {{to changes in the}} cell's environment. This form of gene regulation is called enzyme induction. For example, bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin because enzymes called beta-lactamases are induced that hydrolyse the crucial beta-lactam ring within the penicillin molecule. Another example comes from enzymes in the liver called cytochrome P450 oxidases, which are important in drug metabolism. Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause <b>drug</b> <b>interactions.</b> Enzyme levels can also be regulated by changing the rate of enzyme degradation.|$|E
5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, <b>drug</b> <b>interactions</b> with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: {{this includes}} medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{to what extent}} clustering of related <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> alerts (drug-drug and drug-disease interaction alerts) would decrease the alert rate in clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> alerts generated by CDSSs in community pharmacies. Frequently generated combinations of alerts were analyzed for associations in a 5 % random data sample (dataset 1). Alert combinations with similar management recommendations were defined as clusters. The alert rate was assessed by simulating a CDSS generating 1 alert per cluster per patient instead of separate alerts. The simulation was performed in dataset 1 and replicated in another 5 % data sample (dataset 2). RESULTS: Data were extracted from the CDSSs of 123 community pharmacies. Dataset 1 consisted of 841 [*] 572 dispensed prescriptions and 298 [*] 261 <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> alerts. Dataset 2 was comparable. Twenty-two frequently occurring alert combinations were identified. Analysis of these associated alert combinations for similar management recommendations resulted in 3 clusters (related to renal function, electrolytes, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases). Using the clusters in alert generation reduced the alert rate within these clusters by 53 - 70 %. The overall number of <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> alerts was reduced by 11 % in dataset 1 and by 12 % in dataset 2. This corresponds to a decrease of 21 alerts per pharmacy per day. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Using clusters of <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> alerts with similar management recommendations in CDSSs can substantially decrease the overall alert rate. Further {{research is needed to}} establish the applicability of this concept in daily practice...|$|R

25|$|<b>Drug</b> <b>interactions</b> are {{a complex}} topic. Some <b>drug</b> <b>interactions</b> can be simplistically {{classified}} as either synergistic or inhibitory interactions. In addition, <b>drug</b> <b>interactions</b> can occur {{directly at the}} site of action, through common pathways or indirectly through metabolism of the drug in the liver or through elimination in the kidney. Pancuronium and thiopental have different sites of action, one in the brain and one at the neuromuscular junction. Since the half-life of thiopental is 11.5 hours, the metabolism of the drugs is not an issue when dealing with the short time frame in lethal injections. The only other plausible interpretation would be a direct one, or one in which the two compounds interact with each other. Supporters of the death penalty argue that this theory does not hold true. They state that even if the 100mg of pancuronium directly prevented 500mg of thiopental from working,sufficient thiopental to induce coma would be present for 50 hours. In addition, if this interaction did occur, then the pancuronium would be incapable of causing paralysis.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To simplify risk assessment, we have {{developed}} a way to present critically appraised <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> information through a chart. DATA SOURCES: Fifty drugs most frequently prescribed by Canadian family physicians and 16 drugs and substances that frequently interact with these drugs were {{the basis for a}} literature review. <b>Drug</b> <b>interaction</b> textbooks and MEDLINE (from 1966 to 1994) were searched for documented interactions. Reports of additive effects and animal or in vitro studies were excluded. STUDY SELECTION: All reports of interactions were evaluated for clinical effect, clinical significance, and quality of evidence. SYNTHESIS: Of the 464 drug-drug or drug-substance pairs evaluated, 387 (83. 4 %) demonstrated an interaction, 59 (12. 7 %) documented no effect, and 18 (3. 9 %) pairs had conflicting evidence. Five percent of interactions were of major clinical significance; only 1. 3 % were of major clinical significance and supported by good-quality evidence. By using symbols, colours, and legends in a "grid-map" format, a large amount of <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> information was reduced to a single-page chart suitable for a desk reference or wall mounting. CONCLUSIONS: Our chart organizes a large amount of <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> information in a format that allows for rapid appreciation of outcome, clinical significance, and quality of evidence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The First Challenge of Drug-Drug Interaction Extraction (DDIExtraction 2011) {{involves}} doing {{a binary}} DDI detection {{to determine whether}} a drug pair in a given sentence (with annotated <b>drug</b> names) has <b>interaction</b> information.

In this paper we compare and evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies of example generation from texts and different feature types for drug relation extraction.

40|$|Several {{case studies}} have {{reported}} a possible <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> between warfarin and tramadol where tramadol coadministration enhanced the antithrombotic effects of warfarin. To assess this <b>drug</b> <b>interaction,</b> changes in prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) before and after tramadol coadministration were investigated in patients receiving warfarin. For this study, we examined 54 patients (male/female: 22 / 32, 68. 4 ± 12. 7 years) who were being treated with warfarin for deep vein thrombosis, atrial fibrillation, arteriosclerosis obliterans, congestive heart failure, and other vascular diseases. Significant increases in PT-INR were observed 9. 5 (1 - 118) d after coadministration of tramadol (1. 81 ± 0. 56 vs. 2. 47 ± 1. 10, p< 0. 01). Twenty-eight patients (PT-INR increased group) with PT-INR elevation of greater than 0. 5 or dose reduction of warfarin after coadministration of tramadol were compared with other groups of patients to find <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> risk factors. Logistic regression analysis revealed that lower levels of albumin (3. 5 g/dL or less) [odds ratio (OR) 22. 1; 95 %CI 2. 9 - 169. 9]; lower eGFR (50 mL/min or less) (OR 7. 7; 95 %CI 1. 4 - 42. 0); and PT-INR before tramadol coadministration (OR 38. 2; 95 %CI 3. 7 - 397. 6) were characteristic of the PT-INR increased group. These results suggest that tramadol coadministration enhanced the antithrombotic effects of warfarin in patients with higher PT-INR, lower albumin levels and decreased renal function as the risk factors for this <b>drug</b> <b>interaction...</b>|$|R
