5|$|In {{contrast}} to the early 1990s productions, the mid-1990s Disney animated features presented a trend of <b>diminishing</b> <b>returns.</b> Pocahontas, released in summer 1995, was a critical and commercial disappointment compared to its predecessors, earning $346 million worldwide while still winning two Academy Awards for its music by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. The next film, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), partially produced at the Paris studio, performed better critically and grossed $325 million worldwide. The following summer, Hercules, grossed $252 million worldwide and received positive reviews, but it was responsible for beginning the decline of traditional animated films. The declining box office success became doubly concerning inside the studio as wage competition from DreamWorks had significantly increased the studio's overhead, with production costs increasing from $79 million in total costs (production, marketing, and overhead) for The Lion King in 1994 to $179 million for Hercules three years later. Moreover, Disney depended upon the popularity of its new features {{in order to develop}} merchandising, theme park attractions, direct-to-video sequels, and television programming in its other divisions. The production schedule was scaled back, and a larger number of creative executives were hired to more closely supervise production, a move that was not popular among the animation staff.|$|E
25|$|The {{assumption}} of constant {{returns to scale}} CRS is useful because it exhibits a <b>diminishing</b> <b>returns</b> in a factor. Under constant returns to scale, doubling both capital and labor leads to a doubling of the output. Since outputs are increasing in both factors of production, doubling capital while holding labor constant leads to less than doubling of an output. <b>Diminishing</b> <b>returns</b> to capital and <b>diminishing</b> <b>returns</b> to labor are crucial to the Stolper–Samuelson theorem.|$|E

25|$|The Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus (1798) {{used the}} concept of <b>diminishing</b> <b>returns</b> to explain low living standards. Human population, he argued, tended to {{increase}} geometrically, outstripping the production of food, which increased arithmetically. The force of a rapidly growing population against {{a limited amount of}} land meant <b>diminishing</b> <b>returns</b> to labour. The result, he claimed, was chronically low wages, which prevented the standard of living for most of the population from rising above the subsistence level.

40|$|Background: Blacks’ <b>diminished</b> <b>return</b> {{is defined}} as smaller {{protective}} effects of socioeconomic status (SES) on health of African Americans compared to Whites. Aim: Using a nationally representative sample, the current study aimed to examine if the protective effect of income on chronic medical conditions (CMC) differs for African Americans compared to Whites. Methods: With a cross-sectional design, the National Survey of American Life (NSAL), 2003, included 3570 non-Hispanic African Americans and 891 non-Hispanic Whites. The dependent variable was CMC, treated as a continuous measure. The independent variable was income. Race was the focal moderator. Age, education, and marital status were covariates. Linear regressions were used to test if the protective effect of income against CMC varies by race. Results: High income {{was associated with a}} lower number of CMC in the pooled sample. We found a significant interaction between race and income, suggesting that income has a smaller protective effect against CMC for African Americans than it does for Whites. Conclusion: Blacks’ <b>diminished</b> <b>return</b> also holds for the effects of income on CMC. Blacks’ <b>diminished</b> <b>return</b> is a contributing mechanism to the racial disparities in health in the United States that is often overlooked. More research is needed on the role of <b>diminished</b> health <b>return</b> of SES resources among other minority groups...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} maximizing non-negative {{monotone}} submodular functions under a certain constraint has been intensively {{studied in the}} last decade. In this paper, we address the problem for functions defined over the integer lattice. Suppose that a non-negative monotone submodular function f:Z_+^n →R_+ is given via an evaluation oracle. Assume further that f satisfies the <b>diminishing</b> <b>return</b> property, which is not an immediate consequence of submodularity when the domain is the integer lattice. Given this, we design polynomial-time (1 - 1 /e-ϵ) -approximation algorithms for a cardinality constraint, a polymatroid constraint, and a knapsack constraint. For a cardinality constraint, we also provide a (1 - 1 /e-ϵ) -approximation algorithm with slightly worse time complexity that does not rely on the <b>diminishing</b> <b>return</b> property...|$|R
50|$|The Law of <b>Diminishing</b> Marginal <b>Returns</b> (LDMR) {{shapes the}} SRMC curve. The LDMR states that as {{production}} increases eventually a point (the point of <b>diminishing</b> marginal <b>returns)</b> will be reached after which additional units of output resulting from fixed increments {{of the labor}} input will be successively smaller. That is, beyond the point of <b>diminishing</b> marginal <b>returns</b> the marginal product of labor will continually decrease and hence a continually higher selling price {{would be necessary to}} induce the firm to produce more and more output.|$|R
25|$|The law of {{diminishing}} marginal utility {{is similar to}} the law of <b>diminishing</b> <b>returns</b> which states that as the amount of one factor of production increases as all other factors of production are held the same, the marginal return (extra output gained by adding an extra unit) decreases.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, a bee {{does not}} {{experience}} <b>diminishing</b> <b>returns</b> because of nectar depletion {{or any other}} characteristic of the flowers themselves. In fact, {{the total amount of}} nectar foraged increases linearly with time spent in a patch. However, the weight of the nectar adds a significant cost to the bee's flight between flowers and its trip back to the hive. Wolf and Schmid-Hempel showed, by experimentally placing varying weights on the backs of bees, that the cost of heavy nectar is so great that it shortens the bees' lifespan. The shorter the lifespan of a worker bee, the less overall time it has to contribute to its colony. Thus, there is a curve of <b>diminishing</b> <b>returns</b> for the net yield of energy that the hive receives as the bee gathers more nectar during one trip.|$|E

25|$|In microeconomics, diseconomies {{of scale}} are the cost {{disadvantages}} that firms and governments accrue due {{to increase in}} firm size or output, resulting in production {{of goods and services}} at increased per-unit costs. This typically follows the law of <b>diminishing</b> <b>returns,</b> where further increase in size of output will result in even greater increase in average cost. This concept is the opposite of economies of scale.|$|E
25|$|The {{marginal}} value theorem {{is a type}} of optimality model that is often applied to optimal foraging. This theorem is used to describe a situation in which an organism searching for food in a patch must decide when it is economically favorable to leave. While the animal is within a patch, it experiences the law of <b>diminishing</b> <b>returns,</b> where it becomes harder and harder to find prey as time goes on. This may be because the prey is being depleted, the prey begins to take evasive action and becomes harder to catch, or the predator starts crossing its own path more as it searches. This law of <b>diminishing</b> <b>returns</b> can be shown as a curve of energy gain per time spent in a patch (Figure 3). The curve starts off with a steep slope and gradually levels off as prey becomes harder to find. Another important cost to consider is the traveling time between different patches and the nesting site. An animal loses foraging time while it travels and expends energy through its locomotion.|$|E

[...] The law of <b>diminishing</b> marginal <b>returns</b> applies regardless of whether the production function exhibits increasing, decreasing or constant returns to scale. The key factor is that the variable input is being changed while all other factors of production are being held constant. Under such circumstances <b>diminishing</b> marginal <b>returns</b> are inevitable at some level of production.|$|R

25|$|A {{shift in}} {{preferences}} at the microeconomic level, {{caused by an}} income effect can change the make-up of {{the consumer price index}} to include proportionately more expenditure on services. This alone may shift the consumer price index, and might make the non-trade sector look relatively less productive than it had been when demand was lower; if service quality (rather than quantity) follows <b>diminishing</b> <b>returns</b> to labour input, a general demand for a higher service quality automatically produces a reduction in per-capita productivity.|$|E
25|$|The Preston curve {{indicates}} that individuals born in richer countries, on average, {{can expect to}} live longer than those born in poor countries. However, the link between income and life expectancy flattens out. This means that at low levels of per capita income, further increases in income are associated with large gains in life expectancy, but at high levels of income, increased income has little associated change in life expectancy. In other words, if the relationship is interpreted as being causal, then there are <b>diminishing</b> <b>returns</b> to income in terms of life expectancy.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} non-monotone DR-submodular function maximization, where DR-submodularity (<b>diminishing</b> <b>return</b> submodularity) is {{an extension}} of submodularity for functions over the integer lattice based on the concept of the <b>diminishing</b> <b>return</b> property. Maximizing non-monotone DR-submodular functions has many applications in machine learning that cannot be captured by submodular set functions. In this paper, we present a 1 / 2 +ϵ-approximation algorithm with a running time of roughly O(n/ϵ^ 2 B), where n is the size of the ground set, B is the maximum value of a coordinate, and ϵ > 0 is a parameter. The approximation ratio is almost tight and the dependency of running time on B is exponentially smaller than the naive greedy algorithm. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm outputs almost the best solution compared to other baseline algorithms, whereas its running time is several orders of magnitude faster.
