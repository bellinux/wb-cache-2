5|$|Bodanzky {{considered}} the screenplay a key-element {{on the production}} of Brainstorm; it was her only way of attracting a good cast and staff because it was her first feature film.

Marco Muller, Italian producer of Fabrica Cinema, was also lured by the script, and the film became a Brazil-Italy co-production.|$|E

Many of Rodin's best-known sculptures started as designs of figures for this composition, such as The Thinker, The Three Shades, and The <b>Kiss,</b> <b>and</b> were only later presented as separate and independent works.

40|$|Humans have a bias {{for turning}} to the right {{in a number of}} settings. Here we {{document}} a bias in head-{{turning to the}} right in adult humans, as tested in the act of kissing. We investigated head-turning bias in both <b>kiss</b> initiators <b>and</b> <b>kiss</b> recipients for lip <b>kissing,</b> <b>and</b> took into consideration differences due to sex and handedness, in 48 Bangladeshi heterosexual married couples. We report a significant male bias in the initiation of <b>kissing</b> <b>and</b> a significant bias in head-turning to the right in both <b>kiss</b> initiators <b>and</b> <b>kiss</b> recipients, with a tendency among kiss recipients to match their partners' head-turning direction. These interesting outcomes are explained by the influences of societal learning or cultural norms and the potential neurophysiological underpinnings which together offer novel insights about the mechanisms underlying behavioral laterality in humans...|$|R

Jan is initially disgusted with Michael's antics (which began with Michael changing the meeting location from a hotel meeting room to Chili's without permission) and refusal to talk business, but discovers {{at the end of the}} day that there is a method to his madness when the client bonds with Michael, allowing him to close the deal. Afterwards, in the parking lot, Michael and the recently divorced Jan <b>kiss</b> <b>and</b> leave together.|$|E

5|$|Rodin {{restored}} {{an ancient}} role of sculpture– {{to capture the}} physical and intellectual force of the human subject– and he freed sculpture from the repetition of traditional patterns, providing the foundation for greater experimentation in the 20th century. His popularity is ascribed to his emotion-laden representations of ordinary men and women– to his ability to find the beauty and pathos in the human animal. His most popular works, such as The <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> The Thinker, are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character. To honor Rodin's artistic legacy, the Google search engine homepage displayed a Google Doodle featuring The Thinker to celebrate his 172nd birthday on 12 November 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} panning view of a fence and people with {{umbrellas}} on the left, eventually zooming out on an audience looking through it in the rain. Both Volkova and Katina are then shown singing to the track in Catholic school uniforms.

While continuing to sing to each other during the second chorus, they subsequently start to <b>kiss,</b> <b>and</b> the audience slightly stares at their actions. Following this, several members of the public start to talk to each other, whilst a shot with the camera looking up Volkova's skirt and exposing her underwear is shown during the process.|$|E

5|$|The use of Malmö Stadion for concerts has {{increased}} since {{the construction of}} Swedbank Stadion and Malmö FF's departure. Since 2007, several known artists such as Ozzy Osbourne, Elton John, Dolly Parton, The Eagles, <b>Kiss,</b> <b>and</b> Rod Stewart have performed at the stadium. Due to the climate in Sweden {{and the lack of}} a retractable roof at the ground, all of these concerts have been held during the European summer, between June–August. The main stage has been placed either facing the Southern Stand, or along one of the short sides of the stadium. The pitch has been covered up with wooden floorboards during the performances to minimize the damage done to the grass. Many spectators complained about the less than impressive sound quality at both the Elton John and Dolly Parton concerts, citing the stadiums layout as unsuitable for this kind of concert.|$|E
5|$|The work of Thirty Seconds to Mars {{generated}} {{the interest of}} record producer Bob Ezrin, who had previously worked on several groundbreaking projects, including The Wall by Pink Floyd, Love It to Death by Alice Cooper, and Destroyer by Kiss. Thirty Seconds to Mars contacted Ezrin because they {{felt that he had}} the ability to help them achieve their own vision and create a distinct sound; moreover, the band's members grew up listing to his work with Pink Floyd, <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> Alice Cooper. Brian Virtue, who had previously worked with Jane's Addiction, joined the band and Ezrin in producing the record.|$|E
5|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{retreated to}} the {{isolation}} of Wyoming's countryside in 2001 to record their debut album, working with Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue. They contacted Ezrin because they {{grew up listening to}} his work with Pink Floyd, <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> Alice Cooper and they felt {{he was the only one}} who could help them capture the size and scope of what they wanted to accomplish on their debut recording. The band chose an empty warehouse lot on 15,000 acres, striving for the precise location that would enhance their sound. Even before the album was released, Puddle of Mudd invited Thirty Seconds to Mars to open a six-week tour for them in the spring of 2002. The band later embarked on a North American tour to support Incubus and began a club tour in August.|$|E
