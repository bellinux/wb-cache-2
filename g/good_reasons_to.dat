5|$|In December 1990 Ryzhkov {{suffered}} a heart attack. During his recovery, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union dissolved the Council of Ministers {{and replaced it with}} the Cabinet of Ministers headed by Valentin Pavlov, Ryzhkov's former Minister of Finance. The law enacting the change was passed on 26 December 1990, but the new structure was not implemented until 14 January 1991 when Pavlov took over as Prime Minister of the Soviet Union. Between Ryzhkov's hospitalisation and Pavlov's election as Prime Minister, Lev Voronin acted as the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The reorganisation of the government made it subordinate to the Presidency, weakening the head of government's hold on economic policy. In contrast to Hough's view that Gorbachev had little reason to remove Ryzhkov, Gordon M. Hahn argues that there were <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> replace him given that with Ryzhkov's Politburo support much reduced, the reformist opposition saw him as a conservative.|$|E
5|$|The electors of Cardinal Rolando, {{immediately}} after proclaiming him Pope, attempted to place upon him the purple mantle which symbolized {{the assumption of}} the papal office, but then the election entered the tumultuous stage. Cardinal Ottaviano Monticelli snatched the mantle from Alexander’s back and his armed bands burst into the basilica. Alexander III and his supporters fled to the citadel of St. Peter, {{which was in the}} hands of Cardinal Boso. In their absence, the few cardinals who remained in basilica elected Ottaviano of S. Cecilia to the papacy and enthroned him as Victor IV. The exact number of his electors is not known, but there are <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> believe that it amounted six, including Ottaviano himself, since only five cardinals signed the manifest in his favour in the following month. However, it is possible that some additional cardinals participated in the election of Victor IV but very quickly joined the obedience Alexander III.|$|E

However, the writing style and language employed have left scholars, such as Max Arthur Macauliffe, certain that they were composed after his death.

25|$|It is true {{there are}} cases in which, if we confine {{ourselves}} {{to the effects of}} the first order, the good will have an incontestable preponderance over the evil. Were the offence considered only under this point of view, it would not be easy to assign any <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> justify the rigour of the laws. Every thing depends upon the evil of the second order; it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime, and which makes punishment necessary. Let us take, for example, the physical desire of satisfying hunger. Let a beggar, pressed by hunger, steal from a rich man's house a loaf, which perhaps saves him from starving, can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself, with the evil which the rich man suffers? … It is not on account of the evil of the first order {{that it is necessary to}} erect these actions into offences, but on account of the evil of the second order.|$|E

500|$|In their eight {{first-class}} {{matches in}} 1882, Somerset fielded 30 different players. Only three appeared in all eight matches: Arnold Fothergill, William Herbert Fowler, and Edward Sainsbury, while fourteen players appeared {{in only one}} match that season. The club captain, Stephen Newton, missed the first three matches of the season as he was a schoolmaster in London, and was not available until the summer holidays. Newton {{was not the only}} talented player to only make limited appearances for the side; in their review of the season, the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack explained that Alfred Evans, Robert Ramsay and Bill Roe were all unavailable at various points, and that these absences were among [...] "many <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> account for a disastrous season." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the battle, the {{commander}} of the Numidian cavalry, Maharbal, urged Hannibal to seize the opportunity and march immediately on Rome. It is told that the latter's refusal caused Maharbal's exclamation: [...] "Of a truth the gods have not bestowed all things upon the same person. You know how to conquer, Hannibal; but you {{do not know how to}} make use of your victory." [...] Hannibal had <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> judge the strategic situation after the battle differently from Maharbal. As the historian Hans Delbrück pointed out, due to the high numbers of killed and wounded among its ranks, the Punic army was not in a condition to perform a direct assault on Rome. It would have been a fruitless demonstration that would have nullified the psychological effect of Cannae on the Roman allies. Even if his army was at full strength, a successful siege of Rome would have required Hannibal to subdue a considerable part of the hinterland to cut the enemy's supplies and secure his own. Even after the tremendous losses suffered at Cannae and the defection of a number of her allies, Rome still had abundant manpower to prevent this and maintain considerable forces in Iberia, Sicily, Sardinia and elsewhere despite Hannibal's presence in Italy. Hannibal's conduct after the victories at Trasimene (217 BC) and Cannae, and the fact that he first attacked Rome only five years later, in 211 BC, suggests that his strategic aim was not the destruction of his foe but to dishearten the Romans by carnage on the battlefield and to wear them down to a moderate peace agreement by stripping them of their allies.|$|E

2500|$|William Carpenter (Rhode Island), son of Richard Carpenter of Amesbury was a {{reportedly}} a {{first cousin}} of William Carpenter of Rehoboth, son of William Carpenter of Shalbourne, England. In addition he supposedly was {{closely related to}} Alexander Carpenter of Wrington, Somersetshire, and Leiden, Netherlands, of whom his four married daughters were in the Plymouth Colony in the early 1620s. This derives from Amos B. Carpenter’s unsupported claim that Richard of William of Shalbourne, and Alexander Carpenter were brothers.

2500|$|Prayer plays a {{significant}} role among many believers. Muslims believe that the purpose of existence is to worship God. He is viewed as a personal God and there are no intermediaries, such as clergy, to contact God. Prayer often also includes supplication and asking forgiveness. God is often believed to be forgiving. For example, a hadith states God would replace a sinless people with one who sinned but still asked repentance. Christian theologian Alister McGrath writes that there are <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> suggest that a [...] "personal god" [...] is integral to the Christian outlook, but that one has to understand it is an analogy. [...] "To say that God is like a person is to affirm the divine ability and willingness to relate to others. This does not imply that God is human, or located at a specific point in the universe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Hume leaves {{open the}} {{possibility}} for miracles to occur and be reported, he offers various arguments against this ever having happened in history: He points out that people often lie, and they have <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> lie about miracles occurring either because they believe they are doing so {{for the benefit of}} their religion or because of the fame that results. Furthermore, people by nature enjoy relating miracles they have heard without caring for their veracity and thus miracles are easily transmitted even where false. Also, Hume notes that miracles seem to occur mostly in [...] "ignorant and barbarous nations" [...] and times, and the reason they do not occur in the civilised societies is such societies are not awed by what they know to be natural events. Finally, the miracles of each religion argue against all other religions and their miracles, and so even if a proportion of all reported miracles across the world fit Hume's requirement for belief, the miracles of each religion make the other less likely.|$|E

After several Hamas operatives were killed, either in an explosion or from an Israeli bombing, Hamas officially declared it would launch rockets from Gaza into Israel, and Israel started Operation Protective Edge in the Gaza Strip, formally ending the November 2012 ceasefire agreement. The prime minister did a round of television shows in the United States and described Hamas as [...] "genocidal terrorists" [...] in an interview on CNN. When asked if Gazan casualties from the operation might spark [...] "a third intifada", Netanyahu replied that Hamas was working towards that goal.|$|E
