About half of the complex {{is dedicated to the}} storage of aviation fuel. The remainder of the complex stores oil, kerosene, petrol and diesel fuel <b>for</b> <b>petrol</b> stations across much of the South-East of England.

25|$|The ADR 79/01 vehicle {{standard}} (Australian Design Rule 79/01 – Emission Control for Light Vehicles, 2005) is the Australian {{equivalent of}} OBD-II. It {{applies to all}} vehicles of category M1 and N1 with a gross Vehicle Weight rating of 3500kg or less, registered from new within Australia and produced since January 1, 2006 <b>for</b> <b>petrol</b> (gasoline) engined cars and since January 1, 2007 for diesel engined cars. For newly introduced models, the regulation dates applied a year earlier – January 1, 2005 <b>for</b> <b>petrol</b> and January 1, 2006 for diesel. The ADR 79/01 standard was supplemented by the ADR 79/02 standard which imposed tighter emissions restrictions, applicable to all vehicles of class M1 and N1 with a {{gross vehicle weight rating}} of 3500kg or less, from July 1, 2008 for new models, July 1, 2010 for all models.

25|$|The 3-carbon alcohol, {{propanol}} (C3H7OH), is {{not often}} used as a direct fuel source <b>for</b> <b>petrol</b> engines(unlike ethanol, methanol and butanol), with most being directed into use as a solvent. However, it {{is used as a}} source of hydrogen in some types of fuel cell; it can generate a higher voltage than methanol, which is the fuel of choice for most alcohol-based fuel cells. However, since propanol is harder to produce than methanol (biologically OR from oil), methanol-utilising fuel cells are preferred over those that utilise propanol.|$|E

This {{in line with the}} UAE Cabinet Decision No. 31 of 2006 on the national system of measurement, which mandates the use of International System of units as a basis for the legal units of measurement in the country.

25|$|The list {{of items}} tested has been {{continually}} expanded over the years, including in 1968 – a tyre check; 1977 – checks of windscreen wipers and washers, direction indicators, brakelights, horns, exhaust system and condition of the body structure and chassis; 1991 – checks of the emissions test <b>for</b> <b>petrol</b> engine vehicles, together with checks on the anti-lock braking system, rear wheel bearings, rear wheel steering (where appropriate) and rear seat belts; 1992 – a stricter tyre tread depth requirement for most vehicles; 1994 – a check of emissions for diesel engine vehicles; 2005 – introduction of a computerised administration system for issuing non-secure test certificates. Also rolled out in 2005 {{was the creation of}} the 'Automated Test Bay' this differs from traditional testing by adding additional equipment to the bay to negate the use of an assistant during the test; 2012 – checks of secondary restraint systems, battery and wiring, ESC, speedometers and steering locks.|$|E
25|$|At the {{break-out}} of World War II in Norway on 9 April 1940, all the company's buses {{were taken}} over by the armed forces. From 17 May, the buses were returned to the company, but quotas <b>for</b> <b>petrol</b> were introduced, and the company was forced to install wood gasifiers on its fleet. Both Steinkjer and Namsos were bombed in 1940, but in both towns the company's facilities survived, except the garage in Steinkjer. The buses were at the time spread around the county, and only a single bus was destroyed. After the war ended in 1945, the company had 21 operational buses. The company needed to have a license to purchase buses, and in the following five years, 17 buses were bought for about NOK1 million. They were mostly Volvos and Scania-Vabis, including one from the municipal bus company in Høylandet. In 1946, Fylkesbilene bought Kvam Billag and the routes from Steinkjer to Øvre Kvam. At the same time, the route to Follafoss was extended to the county border. From 1 January 1948, Fylkesbilene bought the private bus operators in Ytre Namdal, and started routes from Vikna, Nærøy, Leka and Bindal via Ottersøy to Namsos. The company in Høylandet was bought to allow direct connection from Ytre Namdal via Høylandet to Grong. The same year, the company introduced a direct service between Verdalsøra and Levanger, that previously had only been served by the railway.|$|E

500|$|After {{discharging}} a {{total of}} 23 rounds, Williams fled the scene by car, firing a further six shots from a second, [...]22 calibre, pistol as he did so. In Stanhurst Way he shot at two boys, aged 10 and 11, who were playing football, and at a woman, but missed them all. Passing through Wednesbury, he shot {{through the windows of}} a barber's shop and two houses. In one of these, a nine-year-old girl was hurt by flying glass.

500|$|Nurkse {{states that}} if {{demand for the}} output of one sector rises, due to the {{complementary}} nature of demand, the demand for the output of other industries will also experience a rise. Paul Rosenstein-Rodan spoke of a similar concept called [...] "indivisibility of demand" [...] which hypothesises that if large investments are made in {{a large number of}} industries simultaneously, an underdeveloped economy can become developed due to the phenomenon of complementary demand. However, both Nurkse and Rosenstein-Rodan only took into consideration the situation of industries that produce complementary goods. There are substitute goods too, which are in competition with each other. Thus if the state pumps in large investments into the car industry, for example, it will naturally lead to a rise in the demand <b>for</b> <b>petrol.</b> But if the state makes large scale investments in the coffee sector of a country, the tea sector will suffer.|$|E
500|$|The first project, {{which was}} {{finished}} in October, was {{to rebuild the}} main runway at the airport to handle Valiants.

The port was managed by 51 Port Detachment. No 504 Postal Unit, which had a detachment at Hickam Air Force Base, a United States Air Force (USAF) base in the American Territory of Hawaii, handled the receipt and despatch of mail, while No 2 Special Air Formation Signal Troop provided communications support. The Royal Army Service Corps provided a butchery, a bakery and a laundry. They also operated DUKWs, amphibious trucks which worked alongside the LCMs.|$|E

500|$|The chassis {{platform}} {{used for}} the C3 Picasso is {{a modified version of}} that in the Citroën C3 and the Peugeot 207, giving it a comparable wheelbase. The reuse of automobile platforms is commonplace, especially for Citroën because the Trnava plant builds the Peugeot 207 and the C3 Picasso. The parent company PSA Peugeot Citroën pools resources and manufacturing for some vehicles, and sometimes rebadges vehicles, combining design teams between two or more brands to create a shared product. The advantage is the designing and testing vehicles at a reduced cost for the participating brands, but creates multiple, identical-looking vehicles for the market, sometimes with minor styling differences. Examples include: the Fiat Scudo, Peugeot Expert and Citroën Dispatch, the Toyota Aygo, Peugeot 107 and Citroën C1, and the Peugeot Partner and Citroën Berlingo. Citroën placed a contractual obligation on the manufacturers to use green materials for the C3 Picasso range. These comprise ≥11% of the [...] of polymers on the vehicle, including the mudguards, parcel shelf and boot carpet. Citroën recommends the vehicle is serviced at least every two years, or at every [...] <b>for</b> <b>petrol</b> models and [...] for the HDi diesel models.|$|E
