5|$|Gravitational metric systems use the {{kilogram-force}} (kilopond) as a {{base unit}} of force, with mass measured in a unit known as the hyl, Technische Mass Einheit (TME), mug or metric slug. Although the CGPM passed a resolution in 1901 defining the standard value of acceleration <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>gravity</b> to be 980.665cm/s2, gravitational units {{are not part of}} the International System of Units (SI).|$|E
5|$|If {{the bike}} and rider are {{considered}} to be a single system, the forces that act on that system and its components can be roughly divided into two groups: internal and external. The external forces are <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>gravity,</b> inertia, contact with the ground, and contact with the atmosphere. The internal forces are caused by the rider and by interaction between components.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that Emanuel Swedenborg first proposed parts of the nebular hypothesis in 1734. Immanuel Kant, familiar with Swedenborg's work, developed the theory further in 1755, publishing his own Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, wherein he argued that gaseous clouds (nebulae) slowly rotate, gradually collapse and flatten <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>gravity,</b> eventually forming stars and planets.|$|E

5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>gravity.</b> An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The {{first three}} terms, {{on either side}} of the equal sign are {{respectively}} the pressure, the kinetic energy density of the fluid and the potential energy density <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>gravity.</b> As can be seen, pressure acts effectively as a form of potential energy.|$|E
25|$|Axial {{precession}} {{is similar}} to the precession of a spinning top. In both cases, the applied force is <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>gravity.</b> For a spinning top, this force tends to be almost parallel to the rotation axis. For the Earth, however, the applied forces of the Sun and the Moon are nearly perpendicular to the axis of rotation.|$|E

25|$|Like {{electromagnetic}} waves, {{gravitational waves}} should exhibit shifting of wavelength {{due to the}} relative velocities of the source and observer, but also due to distortions of space-time, such as cosmic expansion. This is the case even though gravity itself is a cause of distortions of space-time. Redshifting of gravitational waves is different from redshifting <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>gravity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} consideration in proper design and installation of retaining walls {{is to recognize}} and counteract the tendency of the retained material to move downslope <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>gravity.</b> This creates lateral earth pressure behind the wall which depends on the {{angle of internal friction}} (phi) and the cohesive strength (c) of the retained material, as well as the direction and magnitude of movement the retaining structure undergoes.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{components}} of the Coriolis effect. Westward-travelling objects are deflected downwards (feel heavier), while Eastward-travelling objects are deflected upwards (feel lighter). This {{is known as the}} Eötvös effect. This aspect of the Coriolis effect is greatest near the equator. The force produced by this effect is similar to the horizontal component, but the much larger vertical forces <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>gravity</b> and pressure mean that it is generally unimportant dynamically.|$|E
30|$|The {{important}} {{point to be}} noted is that a downward velocity component forms for cuttings <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their <b>gravity</b> and higher density and cuttings tend to precipitate {{as a result of}} gravity and form a cutting film on the wall.|$|R

25|$|There is an {{absolute}} limit on an individual's speed of walking (without special techniques such as those employed in speed walking) due to the upwards acceleration of the centre of mass during a stride – if it's greater than the acceleration <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>gravity</b> the person will become airborne as they vault over the leg on the ground. Typically however, animals switch to a run at a lower speed than this due to energy efficiencies.|$|E
25|$|Glaciers move, or flow, {{downhill}} <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>gravity</b> and {{the internal}} deformation of ice. Ice behaves like a brittle solid until its thickness exceeds about 50m (160ft). The pressure on ice deeper than 50m causes plastic flow. At the molecular level, ice consists of stacked layers of molecules with relatively weak bonds between layers. When the stress on the layer above exceeds the inter-layer binding strength, it moves faster than the layer below.|$|E
25|$|If we were {{to divide}} the dynamic {{pressure}} by the product of fluid density and acceleration <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>gravity,</b> g, the result is called velocity head, which is used in head equations like the one used for pressure head and hydraulic head. In a venturi flow meter, the differential pressure head {{can be used to}} calculate the differential velocity head, which are equivalent in the adjacent picture. An alternative to velocity head is dynamic head.|$|E

The field has no gas cap; petroleum has a low gas-oil ratio between 60-225 standard ft3/bbl. Some crude differentiation occurs, probably <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>gravity</b> separation.

25|$|Single-pass bore {{finishing}} is {{not usually}} done in a milling machine for several reasons. Firstly, most milling machines have only one spindle, so changing the tool more than four to six times can increase cycle times significantly. Secondly, most workpieces that require this process are made on horizontal machining centers (HMC), which reduces float-ability <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>gravity.</b> Thirdly, the lubrication may not be sufficient, {{which can lead to}} material build-up between diamonds, diminishing the tool's effectiveness. Finally, if any chips remain from previous operations they can ruin the tool.|$|E
