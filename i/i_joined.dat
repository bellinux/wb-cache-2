5|$|During the Depression <b>I</b> <b>joined</b> Mrs Mac's {{electrical}} {{school in}} Phillip Street. It {{was the first}} time girls were involved with electrical circuits, Morse and making radio sets. Later Mrs Mac {{decided it was time to}} use our skills in industry, so she persuaded Airzone Ltd to take one of us (me) on trial in their radio section. Soon the others followed from the school, and we started the component parts section, and we were absorbed into many other sections.|$|E
5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When <b>I</b> <b>joined</b> the Regiment I {{was told that}} the best way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought you would like to be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me there were a number of the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E

25|$|As bands {{influenced}} by Bad Brains (such as Living Colour and Fishbone) enjoyed commercial success, Dr. Know {{was approached by}} Mundane Records in 1992, offering the band a major-label record deal. The former Cro-Mags drummer Mackie Jayson (who had played as a session musician on Quickness), and vocalist Israel Joseph <b>I</b> <b>joined</b> at this time. Rise was released in 1993.

25|$|Runs did not flow; {{they were}} grafted from a pitch which kept the batsman hopping around as {{delivery}} after delivery tickled their ribs. Colin was icily superb. For four hours his concentration never wavered...he stroked the ball through {{the cover and}} mid-wicket gaps in the field. Shooters became more frequent, but Colin dug them out. When <b>I</b> <b>joined</b> him at the wicket he was a run short of his maiden Test century: a goal he achieved with a scampered single. If he ever scored a better hundred I hope that I am there to see it.|$|E
25|$|Boniface <b>I</b> <b>joined</b> the Fourth Crusade as a Christian {{leader in}} 1203. In {{accordance}} with promises made to Asti and Alessandria, he officially abdicated the marquisate to William before he left. Immediately, William turned towards Asti, then protected by Milan. The Astigiani {{had a history}} of rebellion and were growing in power. In August, with his father beside him, he formed an alliance with Alba and Alessandria, another rebellious commune, against Asti. His allies proved of little worth as he had to make many concessions to them and was still defeated in the field. In April 1206, he opened negotiations with Asti. The peace treaty was embarrassing for Montferrat, but it was accepted by all three allies. William promised to get his father's ratification, but his father was killed fighting against the Bulgarians unaware of any peace back home.|$|E

He stated, [...] "I always knew I wanted to be in films but I did not know exactly what I wanted to do. I loved movies and watched a lot of them.

500|$|Webb's {{invitation}} to join Caedmon's Call came from Tate, {{who at the}} time was attending Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, TX. Shortly afterward, Webb made the trip to Fort Worth and met future band mate Cliff Young. Webb says, [...] "I essentially just joined that band immediately. And as soon as <b>I</b> <b>joined</b> the band, I quit college the same day." [...] As a result, for almost a full school year he pretended to go to class, with his family unaware he was actually pursuing the band in lieu of going to school.|$|E
500|$|Despite its criticisms, [...] "Saddlesore Galactica" [...] {{received}} some positive reviews. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented on the}} episode, writing: [...] "I remember that 'Saddlesore' was much despised when it first aired, though I can’t recall if <b>I</b> <b>joined</b> that chorus as well. Maybe the many iffy episodes since early 2000 have made it look better, but I think that 'Saddlesore' offers a decent number of laughs. It goes off onto some dopey tangents and displays an unnerving tendency toward self-awareness, but it provides reasonable entertainment." [...] DVD Talk's Ian Jane described the cameo appearance by Bachman and Turner as [...] "fun".|$|E

I think we're lucky because the guests we have on the show often comment on what a good atmosphere Holby has. [...] Paul Bradley who plays Elliot is one of the funniest people to work with - when the cameras aren't rolling he's very good at turning difficult moments into humour when everyone's feeling the strain to finish the day." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna is {{dedicated}} to Kabbalah, and in 2004 she adopted the name Esther which in Persian means [...] "star". She has donated {{millions of dollars to}} New York and London schools teaching the subject.

The influence of the Kabbalah was subsequently observed in Madonna's music, especially albums like Ray of Light and Music. During the Re-Invention World Tour, {{at one point in the}} show, Madonna and her dancers wore T-shirts that read [...] "Kabbalists Do It Better".|$|E

500|$|During {{her time}} on Coronation Street, the {{character}} has {{become synonymous with}} her signature dish at the Rovers Return Inn, Betty's hotpot. ITV have described the dish as [...] "the stuff of legends", and in 1995, pie manufacturer Holland's Pies launched a real-life range of hotpots and pies based on the dish, called [...] "Betty's Kitchen". The idea for the range originated with the firm's marketing director, Dilys Day, who explained: [...] "I was brought up on hotpot and Coronation Street. So when <b>I</b> <b>joined</b> Holland's a year ago, it seemed right to put the two together with Betty's hotpot." [...] Day added that: [...] "We are all very excited about Betty's Kitchen products. Holland's is a strong northern brand, with mass market appeal and wholesome, honest values - {{the same can be}} said for The Street." ...|$|E
500|$|At the Stop the War Conference 2009, he {{described}} the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as [...] "Imperialist war(s)" [...] and discussed the killing of American and allied troops by Iraqi or foreign insurgents, questioning whether they were in fact freedom fighters, and comparing the insurgents to a British Dad's Army, saying: [...] "If you are invaded {{you have a right}} to self-defence, and this idea that people in Iraq and Afghanistan who are resisting the invasion are militant Muslim extremists is a complete bloody lie. <b>I</b> <b>joined</b> Dad's Army when I was sixteen, and if the Germans had arrived, I tell you, I could use a bayonet, a rifle, a revolver, and if I'd seen a German officer having a meal I'd have tossed a grenade through the window.

500|$|Los Espantos (Spanish for [...] "The Terrors"), {{sometimes}} referred to as Los Hermanos Espanto ("The Terror Brothers"), was a Mexican professional wrestling group, called a stable. The original Espantos team consisted of Espanto I (José Eusebio Vázquez Bernal) and Espanto II (Fernando Cisneros Carrillo), but later expanded to a trio when Espanto III (Miguel Vázquez Bernal), the younger brother of Espanto <b>I,</b> <b>joined</b> the group. They primarily worked as a rudo (a term used for wrestlers who portray the [...] "Bad guys") faction for Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL) and on the Mexican independent circuit. As a team Espanto I and II held the Mexican National Tag Team Championship and Espanto II and III held the Northern Mexico Tag Team Championship. The team of Espanto I and Espanto II are considered among the best rudo teams in the history of lucha libre.|$|E
