40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to explore in detail the {{structure}} of the interior flow generated by periodic surface waves on a fluid with constant vorticity. The problem is mapped conformally to a strip and solved numerically using spectral methods. Once the solution is known, the streamlines, pressure and particle paths can be found and mapped back to the physical domain. We find that the flow beneath the waves contains zero, one, two or three stagnation points in a frame moving with the wave speed, and describe the bifurcations between these flows. When the vorticity is sufficiently strong, the pressure in the flow and on the bottom boundary also has very different features from the usual <b>irrotational</b> <b>wave</b> case...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{numerical}} procedure for {{the solution of}} the nonlinear problem of <b>irrotational</b> <b>wave</b> propagation inside a finite or an infinite homogeneous fluid mass is proposed. This procedure is applied to calculate the fluid gravity waves resulting from certain prescribed varying pressure applied to the free surface of an infinite fluid mass with finite or infinite depth. These waves also are calculated analytically within the frame of the linear theory of motion. The variation of the fluid's constant depth, for this application is found to have no influence on the resulting flow. A slight agreement between the numerical solution of the nonlinear problem and the analytical solution of the corresponding linearized problem is noticed in a narrow interval of time following the start of the motion. In the course of time, a significant divergence between the two theories is found, and the nonlinear theory is therefore indispensable for the theoretical prediction of this phenomenon. The proposed procedure can be applied to problems with more complicated geometry...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{concerns}} {{the description of}} surface water waves using the theory of fluid sheets first proposed by Green-Laws & Naghdi (1974). Unlike most traditional wave theories this model is not based upon a velocity potential or stream function representation satisfying Laplace’s equation, but instead adopts a shape function representation that approximates the vertical structure of the velocity field. Subject to this approximation, the governing equations are given by the depth-integrated form of the Euler equations, with both the bottom boundary condition and the nonlinear free surface boundary conditions being satisfied exactly. The principle advantage of the method described herein lies in its versatility. It can be applied in any water depth, to regular and irregular wave fields, and can incorporate varying bottom topography. Furthermore, there are no restrictions placed on the rotationality of the flow field. As a result, it is particularly suited {{to the study of}} wave-current interactions where the wave motion itself may become rotational and cannot therefore be modelled by existing <b>irrotational</b> <b>wave</b> solutions...|$|E

It is demonstrated first that classical second-order Lagrangian Stokes-like approximations do not exactly represent a steady wave {{motion in the}} presence of net mass transport (Stokes drift).

This derivation leads naturally to a Lagrangian Stokes-like perturbation scheme that is uniformly valid for all time – in other words, without secular terms.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of <b>irrotational</b> Faraday <b>waves</b> on an inviscid fluid {{was given by}} Benjamin and Ursell 1954. Here we extend the {{analysis of}} the same problem to purely <b>irrotational</b> <b>waves</b> on a viscous fluid. Following our earlier work on free surface problems, two irrotational theories are presented. In the first theory (VPF) the effects of viscosity enter only through the viscous normal stress term evaluated on the potential. In the second irrotational theory (VCVPF), a viscous contribution is added to the Bernoulli pressure; otherwise the second theory {{is the same as the}} first. The second theory VCVPF gives rise to the same damped Mathieu equation as the dissipation method. Pressure fields are not required and not used in the dissipation method. The dissipation method is a purely irrotational theory, though it depends on viscosity, in which only irrotational velocity fields u = ∇φ are needed. The two purely irrotational theories VPF and VCVPF are not restricted to small viscosities; they are restricted to small vorticity and do not apply near no-slip wall where vorticity is generated. Our VCVPF and dissipation theories give the same damped Mathieu equation as the phenomenological approximation of Kumar and Tuckerman 1994. The damping term in VCVPF is twice the damping rate of VPF.

40|$|We {{consider}} the angle θ of inclination (with {{respect to the}} horizontal) of {{the profile of a}} steady 2 D inviscid symmetric periodic or solitary water wave subject to gravity. Although θ may surpass 30 ^∘ for some irrotational waves close to the extreme wave, Amick [Ami 87] proved that for any <b>irrotational</b> <b>wave</b> the angle must be less than 31. 15 ^∘. Is the situation similar for periodic or solitary waves that are not irrotational? The extreme Gerstner wave has infinite depth, adverse vorticity and vertical cusps (θ = 90 ^∘). Moreover, numerical calculations show that even waves of finite depth can overturn if the vorticity is adverse. In this paper, on the other hand, we prove an upper bound of 45 ^∘ on θ for a large class of waves with favorable vorticity and finite depth. In particular, the vorticity can be any constant with the favorable sign. We also prove a series of general inequalities on the pressure within the fluid, including the fact that any overturning wave must have a pressure sink.

40|$|Using the {{elliptic}} mild-slope equation {{to resolve}} wave fields in large coastal areas requires enormous computer resources, thus imposing a great restriction on {{the applicability of}} this equation for practical engineering problems. An improved numerical model based on the mild slope RCPWAVE model has been developed for computing wave refraction and diffraction in a large coastal area with complex coastline near the Pearl River estuary, in China. An operator splitting method is employed to solve the wave action equation, in which the advection terms are resolved by the Eulerian-Lagrangian method to increase numerical stability and the other terms are discretized by the implicit finite-element method to fit complex coastline geometries.

40|$|The CFD {{simulation}} tool ComFLOW {{is extended}} {{to investigate the}} characteristics of wave motions {{in the presence of}} steady uniform currents. Initially, the inflow boundary is the superposition of waves and current. Effect of the latter on the former is resolved by solving Navier-Stokes equations within the domain as a next step. A Generating and Absorbing Boundary Condition (GABC) with currents is introduced that allows the simulation of a combined wave-current environment in truncated domain. This GABC is characterized by a rational function approximation of dispersion relation, based on Sommerfeld condition and <b>irrotational</b> <b>wave</b> model. The artificial boundaries where GABC with current is applied are transparent to incoming and outgoing waves and currents simultaneously. The absorption properties of the GABC for various waves and currents are analysed. The temporal and spatial differences of free surface elevation between the small domain and large domain turn out to be small, i. e. the GABC prevents the reflection from the boundaries well.

OBJECTIVES We are presently focused on addressing three key aspects of wave breaking: 1. What are the net vertical distributions and flux rates of momentum transfer, vorticity, turbulence intensities, and kinetic energy dissipation from the breaking waves into the mean water column? 2. As multiple random waves of different wavelength superpose to create localized steepness sufficient to induce white capping or mixing events, what are the proportions of wave energy and momentum from different wave components that are dissipated and transferred into the water column? 3.

40|$|Tsunamis {{entering}} into shallow water regions may become highly nonlinear {{and this may}} be due to the irregularity of sea bottom roughness relative to the water depth and the complex coastline geometry. The elliptic mild-slope equation is commonly used to predict the nonlinear wave propagation in shallow water regions but it requires huge amount of computer resources which may not be practical for tsunami propagation predictions. An efficient finite element approach has been adopted in the present project to resolve the nonlinear problem of wave transformation in near shore zones as well as to better conform the model grids to any complex coastline configurations. The efficient approach is based on the wave action conservation equation that takes into account of wave refraction-diffraction and energy dissipation due to bottom roughness. An operator splitting scheme is employed to solve the wave action conservation equation. Firstly, to increase numerical stability, the Eulerian-Lagrangian method is applied to solve the advection terms in the equation. The horizontal terms are then discretized by an implicit finite element method and, finally, the vertical terms are approximated by an implicit finite difference method. A nominal-time iteration method is used to efficiently solve the non-linear <b>irrotational</b> <b>wave</b> number equation for the wave direction. Over 6000 nine-node elements have been used to mesh the Pearl River estuary region. The boundary conditions are based on the results obtained from a simulation applied for a larger computation domain encompassing the entire South China Sea. The computed result provides a general picture of tsunami propagation in the desired region. Model validation and result verification, however, are necessary for any future prediction exercises.

The truncated model {{is used to}} study families of periodic travelling waves of permanent form. It is shown that nonsymmetric periodic waves exist, which appear via spontaneous symmetry breaking bifurcations from symmetric waves. In order to check these results with the full water wave equations, two different methods are used to calculate nonsymmetric gravity waves on deep water. It is found that they exist {{and the structure of}} the bifurcation tree {{is the same as the}} one found for waves on water of finite depth using the weakly nonlinear Hamiltonian model. One of the methods is based on the quadratic relations between the Stokes coefficients discovered by Longuet-Higgins (1978 a). The other method is a new one based on the Hamiltonian structure of the water wave problem. Another weakly nonlinear model is developed from the Hamiltonian formulation of water waves to study the bifurcation structure of gravity-capillary waves on water of finite depth. It is found that, besides a very rich structure of symmetric solutions, nonsymmetric Wilton ripples exist. They appear via spontaneous symmetry breaking bifurcation from symmetric solutions. The bifurcation tree is similar to that for gravity waves. The solitary wave with surface tension is studied with the same model close to a critical depth. It is found that the solution is not unique, and further nonsymmetric solitary waves are possible. The bifurcation tree has the same structure as for the case of periodic waves. The possibility of checking these results in low gravity experiments is discussed.

40|$|The {{properties}} of two-dimensional steady periodic interfacial gravity waves between two fluids in relative motion and of constant vorticities and finite depths are investigated analytically and numerically. Particular attention {{is given to}} the effect of uniform vorticity, {{in the presence of a}} current velocity, on the two factors (identified in the literature as dynamical and geometrical limits) which limit the existence of steady gravity wave solutions. The dynamical limit to the existence of steady solutions is found to be significantly influenced by the uniform vorticity of the lower fluid. In particular, the effect of non-zero vorticity is qualitatively different between a very shallow and a relatively deep lower fluid. Profiles and flow fields corresponding to very steep waves are calculated for a wide range of parameter values. The effect of uniform vorticity on the interfacial wave structure is demonstrated through a direct comparison with <b>irrotational</b> <b>waves.</b> For negative vorticity and high current velocity, a new flow structure is found, consisting of a closed eddy attached to the interface below the crest.

This is done from the generalized Lagrangian mean equations of Andrews and McIntyre which describe an exact theory of nonlinear waves on a Lagrangian mean flow.
