50|$|Canadian {{economist}} Jeff Rubin {{has stated}} that high oil prices are {{likely to result in}} increased consumption in developed countries through partial manufacturing <b>de-globalisation</b> of trade. Manufacturing production would move closer to the end consumer to minimise transportation network costs, and therefore a demand decoupling from gross domestic product would occur. Higher oil prices would lead to increased freighting costs and consequently, the manufacturing industry would move back to the developed countries since freight costs would outweigh the current economic wage advantage of developing countries. Economic research carried out by the International Monetary Fund puts overall price elasticity of demand for oil at −0.025 short-term and −0.093 long term.|$|E

During World War I, countries had abandoned the gold standard, and, except for the United States, returned to it only briefly. By the early 30s, the prevailing order was essentially a fragmented system of floating exchange rates.In this era, the experience of Great Britain and others was that the gold standard ran counter to the need to retain domestic policy autonomy. To protect their reserves of gold, countries would sometimes need to raise interest rates and generally follow a deflationary policy. The greatest need for this could arise in a downturn, just when leaders would have preferred to lower rates to encourage growth. Economist Nicholas Davenport ...|$|E

This thesis explores the roots of Latin American economic inequality in the colonial era and, subsequently, focuses on the developments in the period 1870 - 2000. During the so-called ‘long twentieth century’ the forces of economic modernisation reformed the composition of national income fundamentally. Industrialisation, urbanisation, an increasing pace of technological change and vigorous waves of globalisation and <b>de-globalisation</b> heralded the definitive decay of the rural pre-modern ‘colonial’ society. The crucial question is why Latin American countries nevertheless failed, {{in spite of these}} forces, to settle that longstanding account of the colonial past...|$|E
40|$|History {{offers the}} {{opportunity}} to reflect about sustainability and creativity. Even though contexts and dynamics are specific to the period, sustainability and creativity have always been present in urban matters. After all, {{there has always been}} a reasonable use of resources. But in the contemporary age, the correct balance between the exploitation of resources and their availability may be lost for future generations. The challenge for architecture and urban design is to modify spatial and functional assets responding to cultural differences of citizens. This is an important alternative to homologation and semantic impoverishment by 'archistars' and their followers. We cannot define a method to plan and to design the intercultural, creative and sustainable city but we can fix strategic objectives (Clemente, 2008). We must think cities where everybody can recognise and feel his urban culture. <b>de-globalisation,</b> identity, intercultural cities, sustainability, creativity, intercultural architectures, sustainable development, urban design, urban culture, strategic objectives,...|$|E
40|$|In the {{introduction}} of his book, Richard Baldwin ambitiously says that its reading will “change our {{way to look at}} globalisation”. While the aim may sound too pretentious and in some respect misplaced, The Great Convergence: Information Technology and the New Globalization is certainly timely. While it is hard to say whether or not globalisation has entered a terminal crisis, it is true that we are witnessing to processes of <b>de-globalisation</b> and relative attempts of national governments to regain some sovreignty. Against the view that globalisation has reached its terminus, this book states that on the contary it is entering a new phase. Its central assertion is that the radical changes in communication technology around 1990 s have transformed the nature of globalization, reducing the costs of production and transferring massive north-to-south flows of know-how. What Baldwin calls “New Globalisation” not only has produced a great convergence of profit shares between the most industrialized and some industrializing countries as a consequence of shifting production to the latter, but it also set the basis for a “Third Wave” of globalisation...|$|E
30|$|Science {{diplomacy}} {{links the}} two policy domains {{of foreign affairs}} and science policy. Competitive thinking {{and the ways in}} which this affects global challenges are now putting the globalisation trends in science, technology and innovation under pressure. Rising populism adds to the growth of <b>de-globalisation</b> politics. In an increasingly knowledge driven world this leads to changes in the roles of diplomats. Their focus has already shifted from relatively neutral scientific collaborations to the technology and innovation interests of their home-countries. What are likely future developments of the field of science, technology and innovation diplomacy? The paper explores the future roles and development of innovation diplomacy as the outcome of interactions between the evolving characteristics of science, technology and innovation on the one hand and of international relations and foreign policies on the other. It is explorative, because there is no research tradition on which it can build and requires bringing together insights from several disciplines in new combinations. Trends in the fields of science, technology and innovation and in the field of international relations (including changes in the mechanisms and institutions for global governance) will be discussed. Together these drivers provide a framework through which potential futures of innovation diplomacy can be explored.|$|E
40|$|Globalisation is in crisis. The German Presidency of the G 20 in 2017 {{faces an}} {{unprecedented}} challenge. The G 20 cannot save globalisation on its own, {{but it can}} {{play a vital role}} in finding and facilitating the necessary solutions. This GIGA Focus analyses why the G 20 is well-suited to taking on this task, how it might do so, and the pitfalls it must avoid. Globalisation is worth saving, but it needs to be reformed. The G 20 might be the ideal forum to achieve this. Its strengths lie in its origins as a crisis management group, its flexible structure, and the critical mass of countries that it brings together along with its outreach processes. A G 20 negotiation to rescue globalisation could take three shapes: a) Multilateralism is revitalised and globalisation duly reformed b) multilateralism is diminished and we get a lower-scale but renegotiated globalisation c) multilateralism ends and <b>de-globalisation</b> ensues. The G 20 needs high-level individual and collective political commitment combined with sound issue-specific technical measures to renegotiate the bargain on globalisation. It also needs to address its legitimacy deficit while retaining its efficiency and flexibilty. The German presidency offers a unique opportunity to make the most of the G 20 process and help solve the current crisis. For the G 20 to successfully address the crisis of globalisation, three measures are important: a) Visionary leadership from the highest political levels b) issue-specific and research-backed technical solutions c) attention to enhancing the legitimacy of the group through existing outreach processes and greater inclusiveness towards non-members...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{crisis has}} {{promoted}} a rethinking of financial globalisation, a revision that has also partially interested some official circles. National supervisors have often {{reacted to the}} crises of cross-border banks by ring fencing local interests. Some proposals (e. g. the Vickers Report and the Fed’s subsidiarisation of US establishments of foreign banks) de facto imply a partial <b>de-globalisation</b> of both banks and their supervision. Orthodox regulators and large banks point, on the contrary, to deepen globalisation by means of more homogeneous international standards for prudential regulation and bank resolution. After all, that was the original message of the G 20. The champions of globalisation argue that the new rules on prudential regulation and bank resolution will make bank crises less frequent and serious, while shielding public finances if they occur. Much of the current debate focuses on whether the new rules, especially for bank capitalisation, are strict enough to deliver financial stability. The present paper objects to focusing regulation and supervision solely on stability, to linking stability only to prudential rules and to enhancing the international harmonisation of those rules. The criticism, based on a simple exercise, looks at the structural heterogeneities that characterise both the banking systems and the growth trajectories of some developed economies. Homogenous rules, if effective, would produce inflationary or deflationary strains. If banks must serve economic growth, regulation should found financial stability mainly on structural measures, and supervision should be transformed {{into one of the}} policy tools flexibly looking after local conditions...|$|E
