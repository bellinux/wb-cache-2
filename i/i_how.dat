"At Tregarden lived John de Tregarthyn, temp Edward <b>I,</b> <b>how</b> {{long before}} I know not, after which his posterity {{in this place}} married with the great inheritrixes of Pever, Chamberlayne and Hendower, of Court, in Branell, by which last, by the Cornwalls of that place, they were {{lineally}} descended from Richard, Earl of Cornwall, King of the Romans, by his concubine Joan de Valletort, widow of Sir Alexander Oakeston".|$|E
2500|$|Slowly Vernet {{attracted}} {{notice in}} the artistic milieu of Rome. With a certain conventionality in design, proper to his day, he allied the results of constant and honest observation of natural effects of atmosphere, which he rendered with unusual pictorial art. Perhaps no painter of landscapes or sea-pieces has ever made the human figure so completely {{a part of the}} scene depicted or so important a factor in his design. In this respect he was heavily influenced by Giovanni Paolo Panini, whom he probably met and worked with in Rome. Vernet's work draws on natural themes, but {{in a way that is}} neither sentimental or emotive. The overall effect of his style is wholly decorative. [...] "Others may know better", he said, with just pride, [...] "how to paint the sky, the earth, the ocean; no one knows better than <b>I</b> <b>how</b> to paint a picture". His style remained relatively static throughout his life. His works' attentiveness to atmospheric effects is combined with a sense of harmony that is reminiscent of Claude Lorrain.|$|E
