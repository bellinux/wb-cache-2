[...] Aubrey's treachery led the producer John Houseman in 1959 to dub him [...] "The Smiling Cobra." [...] Houseman in public was less direct. In December 1962, CBS announced it was spending $250,000 an episode on Houseman's hour-long drama on American history for the next season, The Great Adventure, but on July 25, 1963, CBS announced Houseman had resigned. The producer told The New York Times [...] "The kind of show they want <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to produce" [...] but attributed his departure to a simple difference of opinion, the Times reporter stating Houseman [...] "expressed no criticism of CBS." [...] (The show ran for one season, 1963–64.) ...|$|E
500|$|Along with Anton Robinson, Marcus Browning and Stuart Beavon, Doe {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with Weymouth in May 2008. His only goal for Weymouth in the 2008–09 season was against Forest Green Rovers on 25 August, after scoring the equalizer to make the score 1–1 in the 71st minute, with a tap-in following a cross from Ryan Williams. In September, Doe was transfer listed, alongside James Coutts, Danny Knowles, Josh Webb and Michael Malcolm to generate money and bring new players to the club. He responded to being transfer listed by saying [...] "I do not {{see it as a}} big deal. It's not like the club has said to me we are putting you on the transfer list because we do not want you anymore", and suggested it could benefit both parties if a bigger club were willing to [...] "pay a bit of money". On 4 October, Doe was sent off in Weymouth's 3–2 home win over Eastbourne Borough, after he committed a foul on Andy Atkin in the penalty area, which resulted in a penalty kick that was later saved. Southern League Premier Division club Farnborough approached Doe on 30 December. He turned the offer down saying; [...] "moving to Farnborough would mean stepping down two levels which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to do". His last game for Weymouth was against Stevenage Borough on 14 February, in the 3–0 home defeat.|$|E

2500|$|The Maha-punnama Sutta, {{also called}} The Great Full-moon Night Discourse, {{describes}} the impermanence of the aggregates {{to assert that}} there is no self, and the right discernment is, [...] "this is not mine, this is not my self, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am". This theme is retained in the Theravadin six sense bases exegesis, states Bhikkhu Bodhi, which sum up the conditioned existence as [...] "the all" [...] of the sense bases, and that the [...] "six bases are empty of a self and of what belongs to the self".|$|E

It would be a sacrifice for those children to be adopted by same-sex couples" ...|$|E

The song enjoyed commercial {{success in the}} United States, peaking at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the summit of Hot Dance Club Songs and peaked in the top forty in Canada, Australia, Denmark, Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom. The song's music video features shots of black-painted hands that touch Dev while she is standing naked. Dev's debut album The Night the Sun Came Up has been released in United Kingdom on September 20, 2011. Since 2009, Dev {{has been working on}} her debut album with main producers, The Cataracs. In March 2011, Dev and The Cataracs traveled to Costa Rica for three weeks where they recorded and produced most of the material for the new album. She said of the album's genres, [...] "typical pop music <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am only good at doing; I have a lot of ideas and hip-hop influence records, some electro ballads." [...] In March 2011, New Boyz's single [...] "Backseat", featuring Dev and The Cataracs, was released. The song peaked at number twenty-six on the Billboard Hot 100. She was featured on Demi Lovato's album [...] "Unbroken" [...] on a song called [...] "Who's That Boy".

2500|$|GameZone's Michael Lafferty {{scored the}} Xbox version 8 out of 10, writing [...] "the {{essence of the}} fantastic {{adventure}} is there, and while the game does chart an extremely linear path through the lands of Middle-earth, there are enough challenges along the route to enable players to joyfully experience the urgency and terror of the journey." [...] IGN's Kaiser Hwang scored it 6.7 out of 10. He was critical of the combat, the enemy AI, and how the plot was handled. He concluded [...] "the book itself is very non-linear in format and can {{be very hard to}} translate into an effective game without leaving some of the detail out. But to reduce to the story to almost childish levels <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had in mind. Didn't we learn that from 1978's Lord of the Rings animated movie?" [...] GameSpy's Steve Steinberg scored it 3 out of 5, arguing [...] "the actual gameplay takes a backseat. The die-hard Tolkien will {{get a kick out of}} slugging and spell-casting their way through the first book of the Rings trilogy, but the casual gamer will only be disappointed by an otherwise generic action/adventure title. GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker scored it 5.7 out of 10, writing [...] "even the blessing of Tolkien Enterprises isn't enough to save the game from its bland design and tedious gameplay." [...] He called it [...] "an average game at its best and a frustrating and boring one at its worst." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored it 4 out of 10, comparing it unfavorably with EA's Two Towers; [...] "EA shames Vivendi's effort for presentation and general slickness." [...] He was heavily critical of the inability to invert the camera controls, which he referred to as an [...] "industry standard option" [...] in third-person games. He concluded [...] "this has [...] "licensed toss" [...] written all over it. The goal was [...] "to create the most authentic Lord of the Rings game experience possible." [...] Quite honestly, Melbourne House's [...] had more going for it." ...|$|E
