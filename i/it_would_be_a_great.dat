In 1941 China's first animated feature film of notable length, Princess Iron Fan, was released under very difficult conditions during Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II using extensive rotoscoping. While there were overlapping progress made in the Asian regions with Japanese anime at the time, they were not geographically or artistically influential to China directly. During the Japanese invasion period, the brothers produced more than 20 animated propaganda shorts focusing on various patriotic topics from resistance against Japanese troops, opium and imperialism.|$|E
25|$|Parker {{was looking}} ahead to the future when he persuaded Presley to sign up as a regular soldier. Presley had wanted to join Special Services, {{allowing}} {{him the opportunity to}} continue to perform {{while at the same time}} getting an easier ride than other soldiers. Parker, on the other hand, was fully aware that any special treatment given to Presley would instantly be used against him in the media and by those who disliked his style of music. If Presley could show the world that he was just the same as any other young man, Parker told him, then more people would be likely to accept him and his music. Parker was also afraid that any attempt to block Presley from being drafted would result in a more detailed look into his own service record. He also realized that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> opportunity to promote Presley by having the media witness his induction day, including the Army haircut that would see the most famous hair style in the world destroyed.|$|E

When the writing staff conceived the idea for the speedway parts, they were thinking that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> opportunity for them to get several NASCAR drivers to make guest appearances in the episode. However, according to Scully, they could not get a single one because [...] "they were all concerned about the way we were portraying NASCAR".

500|$|This episode {{began the}} {{resolution}} of the story arc about Desmond's prophecy regarding Charlie's inevitable death, which began earlier in the season and would ultimately end in the finale. [...] The storyline was conceived while producing {{the latter part of the}} second season when the writers were brainstorming ideas for a new storyline for Charlie. [...] While Desmond could have had flashes of the future about anyone, Charlie was chosen over a less significant character so that the story would have higher stakes. [...] Additionally, the writers decided that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> way to bring out the heroic side of Charlie, with Charlie being the only character to die willingly. [...] Despite the problems in Charlie's life, the writers believed that Charlie always was a good person and wanted to show that with the happiest moments of the character's life. [...] Monaghan thought that [...] "Greatest Hits" [...] was made [...] "to allow the audience to sit with [...] long enough to prepare themselves for what was going to happen [...] ".|$|E

You get to hear the real story of the songs, which is important to me". The audience for the program was selected on a contest where fans over the age of 18 could send photos and explain why they were fans of Perry. The episode featuring Perry was recorded on July 22, 2009. For the recording, Perry was dressed in a pale pink chiffon evening gown, with flowers in her hair. She further said: [...] "Some people have an idea who I am, a little piece of the cake, but I get to show off really more. I have a larger-than-life personality and my clothes reflect that. For MTV Unplugged, I wanted to be a mixture of Stevie Nicks and a fairy!".|$|E

500|$|... "I See You" [...] {{was written}} by James Horner and Kuk Harrell and {{produced}} by Simon Franglen as the official theme song to James Cameron's 2009 film, Avatar. It {{is the second time}} that Horner and Franglen have collaborated on a theme song for a film directed by Cameron, the first being [...] "My Heart Will Go On", performed by Celine Dion and used for his 1997 film Titanic. In an interview with Rick Edwards for 4Music called Under the Skin of Leona Lewis, Lewis explained how she became involved with Avatar and recording the theme tune. The singer said that she had known about the project for some period of time as she is very interested in film in general, and that she was approached by Cameron to record Avatars official theme song. She continued to say that she was very excited about seeing the film, even before her involvement with the film came to be. Cameron invited Lewis to listen to what they had in mind for the song, and upon hearing it, she [...] "immediately wanted to be on board." [...] One of the reasons Lewis gave as to why she accepted the proposal was that a lot of her second studio album, Echo (2009), was inspired by various films, and she thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> opportunity to appear on a soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|There were {{a number}} of {{positive}} reviews for Dark Horse, with Billboard magazine deeming it a [...] "Spotlight" [...] release. The reviewer described the album as [...] "an excellent one" [...] and compared it favourably with Harrison's acclaimed 1970 triple set, All Things Must Pass. Brian Harrigan of Melody Maker credited Harrison with establishing [...] "a new category in music – Country and Eastern" [...] and lauded his [...] "nifty" [...] slide-guitar playing and [...] "tremendous" [...] singing. Although he found some of the tracks overlong, Harrigan declared: [...] "Yep, the Sacred Cowboy has produced a good one." [...] Combined with his feature on the tour in Circus Raves, in which he questioned the accuracy of the negative reports about the Harrison–Shankar concerts, Michael Gross described Dark Horse as matching All Things Must Pass in quality, and [...] "surpassing" [...] it at times, thanks to the new album's [...] "clarity of production and lovely songs". Gross highlighted [...] "So Sad" [...] as a [...] "luxurious track" [...] and described [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong", [...] "Dark Horse" [...] and [...] "Far East Man" [...] as [...] "all, simply, good songs". Sue Byrom of Record Mirror said that, apart from [...] "Hari's on Tour", side one of the LP was overly reliant on All Things Must Pass-era musical and lyrical themes, and that the album only [...] "kicks off properly" [...] with [...] "Ding Dong". She added: [...] "If the first side had contained the variety and progression of the second, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> album …" ...|$|E

2500|$|Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes {{observed}} the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution clearly forbade the states from excluding citizens from juries due solely to their race.

According to the U.S. Supreme Court, [...] "something more" [...] was needed. The Court concluded, [...] "the motion to quash ... should have been granted."

2500|$|In {{one version}} of the epic, on the 23rd day of battle, Bhishma {{attempted}} to use the Pashupatastra against Parashurama.

Before he could release it, however, a voice from the sky warned him that [...] "if he uses this weapon <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> insult towards his Guru."

He {{has called for a}} demarcation of borders between Russia and Ukraine, which has been delayed by Russia since Ukraine won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. During the campaign for the Ukrainian presidential election, 2010 Yushchenko said Russia's influence was again a factor in the upcoming election and warned of [...] "interference" [...] from Moscow in the distribution of Russian passports to residents of Crimea.

2500|$|... {{has been}} of central {{significance}} {{to the development of}} human society. It can be the beginning, not only of individual knowledge, information and awareness, but also a holistic strategy for development and change. Education is very much connected to women's ability to form social relationships on the basis of equality with others and to achieve the important social good of self-respect. It is important, as well, to mobility (through access to jobs and the political process) and to health and life (through the connection to bodily integrity). Education can allow women to participate in politics so they can ensure that their voices and concerns are heard and addressed in the public policy. It is also crucial for women's access to the legal system. Although it must be considered that religion and traditions of the Pakistani affect women's education. Some women may choose to keep the traditional roles because that is what they have always known and are used to. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> opportunity if women were able to make their choice on their own, though.
