5|$|The Lower Earley development, {{built in}} 1977, {{was one of}} the largest private <b>housing</b> <b>developments</b> in Europe. It {{extended}} the urban area of Reading as far as the M4 motorway, which acts as the southern boundary of the town. Further <b>housing</b> <b>developments</b> have increased the number of modern houses and hypermarkets in the outskirts of Reading. A major town-centre shopping centre, The Oracle, opened in 1999, is named after the 17th century Oracle workhouse, which once occupied {{a small part of the}} site. It provides three storeys of shopping space and boosted the local economy by providing 4,000 jobs.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{have applied}} system {{dynamics}} to analyse <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> in Hong Kong new towns. Because <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> {{is concerned with}} many factors such as population growth, employment, personal income, gross domestic product and government policies, it is a complex social-economic system that demands system thinking for its solution. We have constructed a system dynamics model that attempts to describe <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> in new towns. In this model, the interactions of various factors in urban <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> are taken into consideration. The model has been implemented in a computer simulation package named “I think”. The simulation provides a trend of future <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> in Hong Kong new towns. These results can assist decision makers produce more appropriate plans for future <b>housing</b> <b>development.</b> We found that the application of system dynamics into <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> is a new and fruitful attempt...|$|R
