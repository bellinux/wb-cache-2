5|$|Brawl {{contains}} 41selectable stages, 29 {{of which}} are initially available. Many stages undergo elaborate changes while battles take place, such as a cycling day-to-night system and changing seasons. A stage based on the Animal Crossing series features a live events system in which special events may occur depending on the date and time. Environmental gameplay mechanics are <b>featured</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> installment, such as destructible terrain {{and the ability to}} float. Unlike its predecessors, Brawl includes stages based on third-party games such as the Metal Gear Solid-inspired Shadow Moses Island. The game also includes stages taken from its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Melee.|$|E
5|$|Heskey was {{selected}} in the squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, and {{was used as a}} makeshift option to play in England's left-wing role in the match against Sweden, but did not perform well out of his regular position. He scored against Denmark in England's 3–0 victory, which saw England reach the quarter-finals of the tournament. He <b>featured</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> match, where England were beaten 2–1 by the eventual champions Brazil. He and teammate Ashley Cole received abuse from some Slovakia supporters when England played them in a friendly in October 2002, which led to UEFA opening an investigation into the allegations. Slovakia were eventually forced to play their next home international behind closed doors.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} received mixed reviews. Prell {{thought that}} the mission-design was varied, and the voting system kept the mode from being repetitive. He also praised the interconnected structure between the single-player and multiplayer, noting that the items that could be carried over from multiplayer to campaign made the mode feel rewarding for players. Reiner {{thought that the}} action <b>featured</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> mode is satisfying, but thought that the system lacked enough depth and complexity to engage players. Patterson echoed similar thoughts, and felt that the ability of players to switch between the campaign and the Chaos Squad mode made the multiplayer mode a rewarding experience. Brown criticized the mode, saying that its difficulty was not properly scaled.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode {{can be traced back}} to an early idea Vince Gilligan, the writer of the episode, had. His {{original}} idea featured a man holding an individual hostage on a Tilt-A-Whirl. Gilligan pitched this idea at several meetings and it soon became a recurring joke. Most of the comments Gilligan received noted that his premise lacked an explicit mystery to investigate and so Gilligan decided that after the ride was shut off, the man's head would explode. Researching various government experiments, Gilligan discovered the controversial use of low-frequency waves. The secret military experiment <b>featured</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> episode is based on two real-life military experiments, Project HAARP and Project ELF. The former is a U.S. Army experiment dealing with electromagnetic radiation in the Earth's ionosphere, and the second is a U.S. Navy experiment dealing with long wavelengths. Thus, a script was crafted that featured an individual that, due to a secret experiment, could not slow down for fear of rupturing his head.|$|E
