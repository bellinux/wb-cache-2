25|$|Why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{are sure}} a {{particular}} activity — e.g. Olympic target shooting — {{is a game}} while a similar activity — e.g. military sharp shooting — is not? Wittgenstein's explanation is tied up with an important analogy. How do we recognize that two people we know are related to one another? We may see similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. If we see enough matches we say we've noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps {{important to note that}} this is not always a conscious process — generally we don't catalog various similarities until we reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively see the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that {{the same is true of}} language. We are all familiar (i.e. socially) with enough things which are games and enough things which are not games that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.|$|E
500|$|The last {{of these}} pamphlets, Taxation No Tyranny (1775), was a defence of the Coercive Acts and a {{response}} to the Declaration of Rights of the First Continental Congress of America, which protested against taxation without representation. Johnson argued that in emigrating to America, colonists had [...] "voluntarily resigned the power of voting", but they still had [...] "virtual representation" [...] in Parliament. In a parody of the Declaration of Rights, Johnson suggested that the Americans had no more right to govern themselves than the Cornish people, and asked [...] "How <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?" [...] If the Americans wanted to participate in Parliament, said Johnson, they could move to England and purchase an estate. Johnson denounced English supporters of American separatists as [...] "traitors to this country", and hoped that the matter would be settled without bloodshed, but he felt confident that it would end with [...] "English superiority and American obedience". Years before, Johnson had stated that the English and the French were just [...] "two robbers" [...] who were stealing land from the natives, and that neither deserved to live there. After the signing of the 1783 Peace of Paris treaty, marking the colonists' defeat of the British, Johnson was [...] "deeply disturbed" [...] with the [...] "state of this kingdom".|$|E
2500|$|The New Testament has {{a biblical}} account of Arab {{conversion}} to Christianity {{recorded in the}} book of Acts. When Saint Peter preaches to the people of Jerusalem, they ask, [...] "And how <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> hear, each of us in his own native language? [...] both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians—we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God." [...] (Acts 2:8, 11, English Standard Version). Arab Christians are thus one of the oldest Christian communities.|$|E

2500|$|The {{nature of}} American {{democracy}} was also questioned. The sentiment {{was that the}} country lacked [...] " [...] monarch, aristocracy, strong traditions, official religion, or rigid class system," [...] according to Rubin, and its democracy was attacked by some Europeans {{in the early nineteenth}} century as degraded, a travesty, and a failure. The French Revolution, which was loathed by many European conservatives, also implicated the United States and the idea of creating a constitution on abstract and universal principles. That the country was intended to be a bastion of liberty was also seen as fraudulent given that it had been established with slavery. [...] "How <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?" [...] asked Samuel Johnson in 1775. He famously stated that, [...] "I am willing to love all mankind, except an American".|$|E
60|$|But {{why this}} gloom {{at the thought}} of the dead? And why should we not be glad? <b>Is</b> <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> ever think of them as {{departed}} from all joy? <b>Is</b> <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> believe that indeed they are dead? They revisit us not, the departed; their voices no more ring in the air; summer may come, but it is winter with them; and even in our own limbs we feel not the sap that every spring renews the green life of the trees.|$|E

30|$|Since our {{tracking}} {{application is}} targeted to mobile platforms, which have limited resources, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important <b>that</b> <b>we</b> view <b>it</b> comprehensively as a multiobjective design problem (e.g., see [19]). Apart from developing a tracking application with good output accuracy, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important <b>that</b> <b>we</b> also optimize memory requirements, power consumption, and execution time. Therefore, we apply design methods and optimization techniques that {{take all of}} these metrics into account.|$|R

40|$|You {{have to ask}} yourself, {{why would}} you start a {{technical}} session dealing with communications. You know we are all here to learn various aspects of our trade. Why start {{it out with a}} session on communications? Well, let me give you the answer to that one. The success of every enterprise depends on public goodwill. When I first read that I thought, yes, in a free society the success of every enterprise depends on public goodwill. But then the Berlin wall came down, communism collapsed and you realize that even tyranny cannot withstand the pressure of public goodwill. So, it becomes tremendously important to us all that the public understands what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do, the value of what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do, and the rightness of what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do...|$|R
