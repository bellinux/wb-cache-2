40|$|Aim: To {{update the}} first version of the European core {{curriculum}} to reflect many developments in radiotherapy and educational philosophy that have taken place in the interim period. Materials and methods: The first version of the European core curriculum was reviewed by the Steering Group together with current education programmes from the various member states and taking into account the developments and changes that have taken place in radiotherapy. From these <b>initial</b> meetings, a <b>working</b> <b>document</b> and provisional timetable were prepared, Given the diversity of the existing programmes, the language difficulties and lack of national curricula it was agreed that a representative from both the clinical and academic areas endorsed by their national professional body would be identified for each country. These participants were then invited to participate in two workshops and the <b>working</b> <b>document</b> and timetable were circulated. Two workshops were held and a final draft document was circulated to the professional bodies and other interested groups. Results: The revised European Core Curriculum for RTTs was endorsed by the participants of the workshops representing academic and clinical areas of all the member states and was welcomed by the wider circulation. Compared to {{the first version}} the revised curriculum describes the background underpinning the practice of radiation therapy and the variation across the member states, issues of staffing, educational philosophy, certification level, legislation governing recognition of qualifications and a core syllabus. Conclusion: The revised core curriculum is an important step in the progress of professional recognition for RTTs, towards harmonisation of education programmes in Europe and meeting the aim of best practice and equality of care for all patients receiving radiotherapy. Responsibility for developing education programmes from the curriculum will rest with the local and/or national education bodies and authorities. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|A Masters Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This study set out to produce a <b>working</b> <b>document</b> for teachers and headteachers in Coventry schools. This <b>working</b> <b>document</b> was written to offer guidelines for physical education departments {{in the design and}} implementation of their own curriculum and to raise their awareness of the role that physical education can perform in schools. It details recent trends and issues in the community and describes in particular the philosophy of Coventry Education Authority. This philosophy is reflected in the L. E. A. document 'Comprehensive Education for Life' (Coventry 1982), and the <b>working</b> <b>document</b> responds to this publication, in particular, to its commitment to life-long education and the pursuit of active-learning styles. The implications these local and national trends have for physical education departments were examined and detailed in the <b>working</b> <b>document.</b> Twenty-five interviews were recorded on tape and provided a data ·base for analysis. Themes were drawn from these interviews and it was possible to articulate major lines of development that key people in the profession were identifying. Drawing upon the evolutionary development of the document, interviews and seminars with key people in the field, it was possible to identify major aspects of work that· ought to be developed in physical education if the profession was going to translate important aspirations into a guide for action. The study helped to evolve a framework which describes a direction for the physical education curriculum and also what it can sample and focus upon. By recording this development in the <b>working</b> <b>document,</b> physical education departments were then encouraged to explore this framework and from using examples of current practice described in the document, developed their own programmes. Finally the <b>working</b> <b>document</b> presents a collection of teaching and learning processes in current practice which help the teaching of physical education focus upon the individual's personal development. Throughout the document, suggestions for evaluating the curriculum, teaching and learning are proposed, and physical education departments are challenged to review their curriculum...|$|R
