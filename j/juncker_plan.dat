40|$|Introduction. The draft {{regulation}} on the <b>Juncker</b> Investment <b>Plan</b> was {{presented by the}} European Commission in January and has been discussed by the Ecofin Council on 10 March. This leaves sufficient time for the European Parliament to express its views {{and to make the}} Plan operational by the summer, as aimed for by President Juncker. But while governments agreed swiftly, ministers did not decide on two issues that are of importance: the eligibility of projects that have benefited from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) and the Horizon 2020 programmes and the contributions of the national promotional banks (NPBs) to the investment plan. This commentary argues that the foreseeable engagement of NPBs remains unsatisfactory...|$|R
40|$|The March 2015 European Council {{might not}} enter history books, but {{the outcome of}} an {{informal}} ‘mini summit’ between seven EU leaders {{has the potential to}} prepare the grounds for a breakthrough in the negotiations between Athens and its lenders. In this post-summit analysis, Janis A. Emmanouilidis argues that the search for a compromise promises to be a cumbersome, time-consuming and nerveracking exercise. But a solution now seems possible, proving all those doomsayers who have been predicting a ‘Grexit’ or ‘Graccident’ wrong. On other topics, EU leaders committed their countries to build an Energy Union, although questions remain about whether member states will agree to cede sovereignty on a number of significant points. This analysis looks also at the economic issues dealt with at the Spring Summit, with a focus on the perspectives for the European Semester and the <b>Juncker</b> Investment <b>Plan.</b> It ends with a summary of decisions taken on a number of other topics, including relations with Russia and Ukraine, the upcoming Eastern Partnership summit, developments in Libya and in Tunisia, and the endorsement of the Council’s new Secretary General...|$|R
30|$|Our aim in {{this paper}} is to utilize the {{algorithmic}} feedback control framework for the design of short-term fiscal policy interventions. That is, we want to design linear feedback policy rules for the fiscal policy instruments available so that predetermined (fixed) desired sequences for the policy targets (GDP and public debt levels) are simultaneously tracked. In particular, we assume that the policymaker has at his disposal two instruments: expenditures related to compensation of public sector employees, social benefits, etc. (i.e., expenditures that cover individual and collective consumption) and expenditures related to investment projects (e.g., infrastructure) that will be funded by the government (either via its own budget or by using external funding such as EU structural funds or the funds available from the so-called <b>Juncker</b> Investment <b>Plan).</b> These investment expenditures are subject to several time lags (including, among others, legislative, design and implementation lags), and as a result, they will affect the economy with a possibly substantial delay; however, the feedback mechanism used allows us to explicitly incorporate these lags into the design of the fiscal policy rules. These rules will provide the exact sequence of the policy instruments necessary to ensure that the target levels of GDP and public debt will be simultaneously met, without any deviation (thus, the tracking error will be equal to zero).|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{quantifying}} {{the impact}} of a stimulus plan based on a public investment push, within a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of the Eurozone economy. We estimate an extension of Leeper et al. ’s (2010) model with public capital and time-to-build, to quantify {{the impact of}} the European Commission’s Investment Plan for Europe (the “Juncker plan”). The public investment push is assessed in normal times and starting from the zero lower bound, making different hypotheses on private investment leverage and on capital productivity. Then, in order to assess the effectiveness of the <b>Juncker</b> <b>plan,</b> we compare it with the stimulus plan implemented by the Obama administration in 2009. The main conclusion of the paper is that, had it been implemented {{at the beginning of the}} crisis, the <b>Juncker</b> <b>plan</b> would have had a significant positive impact. But as it is being launched very late in the crisis, to be effective the plan should be significantly larger in size...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} master´s {{thesis is}} to analyse and define the political-economic {{ideology}} followed by the European Union as well as look at its potential transformation after the global financial crisis, especially {{with the introduction of}} the <b>Juncker</b> <b>plan.</b> In this regard, the research draws attention primarily to European Union´s investment strategy and youth unemployment as the two variables contributing to the delimitation of the theoretical paradigm from which the European Union emanates. The study first introduces two theoretical concepts that are most relevant for characterising European Union´s behaviour, which according to the existing literature are modern-Keynesianism and neoliberalism. These, after the analysis of the constellation of the European Social Fund and the European Investment Bank, answer the question which political-economic paradigm is more consistent with the present European Union´s set-up and thus help us to derive what the currently followed ideology is. Ultimately, attention is then drawn to the <b>Juncker</b> <b>plan</b> determining whether the new investment plan for Europe brings a change not only from the policy perspective but also from the ideological point of view...|$|E

Nearly 9 years after the meltdown of the financial system of developed countries, after a violent recession followed by the euro debt crisis in 2012, a recovery finally started in late 2014. It has been pushed by a mix of fair winds, such as low oil prices, low interest rates, a lower effective exchange rate of the euro, a less negative fiscal stance in the euro area and unconventional monetary policies. Adding to those fair winds, the Juncker commission took stock of the worrying situation in 2015 and proposed the <b>Juncker</b> <b>Plan</b> to boost (mostly private) investment in the EU...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{years after}} the {{outbreak}} of the crisis, the Eurozone (EZ) fiscal policy remains fragmented at the national level. This paper fills the structural gap between the monetary and fiscal dimensions of EZ economic policy by suggesting a ‘conventional’ direction to the unconventional Quantitative Easing (QE) policy of the European Central Bank (ECB). We propose an evolution for QE to tackle the shortcomings of the current ‘decentralized’ fiscal policy in the EZ. In a nutshell, we suggest a change in the composition of QE asset purchases, focusing on buying European Investment Bank (EIB) bonds that, in turn, would be used to finance real investments through the <b>Juncker</b> <b>Plan</b> programme. The rationale of our proposal is legitimised by an overview of the gloomy macroeconomic conditions of the EZ, and the situation in ongoing policies. The mechanism is described in detail, with a discussion of both its strengths and possible limitations...|$|E

40|$|Executive Summary. The {{euro area}} is still {{suffering}} from low growth and high unemployment. For the recovery {{to become a}} reality, {{there needs to be}} a balance between fiscal discipline, supply side improvements and actions aimed at stimulating demand and growth. Increasing investment, both private and public, are important components in overcoming the recession. This becomes especially clear when comparing investment dynamics during the crisis with pre-crisis levels. Total investment is still much lower than before the crisis and public investment is well below its pre-crisis peak as well. In late November 2014, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker submitted a long-awaited proposal for a European Investment Plan that aims to stimulate private investment. Apart from the creation of the new European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), through which private investors will receive public guarantees, the investment plan also aims to provide project assistance and improve the Single Market by removing sector-specific or other financial barriers to investment. While generally perceived as a first positive step towards increasing private investment, some commentators have expressed reservations about the plan. These include, among others, the lack of fresh money for the initial contributions to EFSI. Since a substantial amount of these contributions is reshuffled from other places in the European budget, the question was raised whether EFSI can fund additional projects or just replicates investment projects that would have happened without the plan. Other criticism relates to the high estimate of the expected leverage ratio of 1 : 15, and to the risk that the plan will only have a limited impact on stressed economies. The <b>Juncker</b> <b>Plan</b> addresses private investment, but so far there really is no clear strategy to stimulate productive public investment on the European and national level. Countries with fiscal space are reluctant to engage in higher spending, while those willing and in need of it the most are restricted by the rules. Member States and the Commission should therefore discuss options for further improving the euro area's economic governance. In addition to urging countries with fiscal space to increase investing in national public goods, investment could be treated with budget flexibility. One could, for instance, upgrade the importance of public investment in the European Semester. Additional deficit granted for public investment purposes could be attached to certain Country-Specific Recommendations. Another solution would be to allow some form of budget flexibility, such as the formulation of a new Golden Rule for productive public investment becoming part of the Stability and Growth Pact's application. Besides relying on a larger amount of flexibility in the rules, the Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) could be another solution to fund investment in European public goods. It will also be necessary to overcome the mistrust among Member States that is preventing further action. The political bargain of stronger conditionality, such as through contractual arrangements, could improve the situation. Increased trust will also be an important condition for tackling long-reaching economic governance reforms such as the creation of a Fiscal Capacity, which could take the form of a macroeconomic shock insurance. Such a Fiscal Capacity could make a real difference in providing the necessary funding to maintain productive public investment, even in times of deep recessions. The proposals presented do not attempt to be conclusive, but shall rather be an input for a wider debate on how to increase growth and employment in Europe. The paper draws heavily on the discussion of a Workshop on Growth and Investment, which the European Policy Centre (EPC) hosted on 10 December 2014 under Chatham-House Rule, with a group of economists and representatives from the European institutions...|$|E
