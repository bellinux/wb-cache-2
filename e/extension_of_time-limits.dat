Grey responded by urging the German ambassador to attempt a four-power conference of Britain, France, Italy and Germany at Vienna to mediate between Austria-Hungary and Russia, Serbia's patron, or at least to obtain an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the <b>time-limit</b> set by Austria-Hungary. Grey again proposed a four-power conference on 26 July. He also suggested that Russia and Austria-Hungary should be encouraged to negotiate.

40|$|This report {{examines}} time-limited welfare {{beginning at}} the broadest level, tracing the rapid emergence <b>of</b> <b>time-limited</b> welfare as a policy approach in part I. Chapter 1 examines the history <b>of</b> <b>time-limited</b> welfare and the key challenges posed by this policy. Part II begins {{to focus on the}} three participating states [...] Florida, Vermont, and Wisconsin [...] describing the goals, evolution, and planning of the policies. Chapter 2 examines the roots of the three programs, characteristics of locations where the programs are operating, and attitudes and characteristics of welfare recipi(nts subject to the programs. These contextual factors have helped to shape the policies that are discussed in chapter 3 and implementation experiences that are examined in part III. Part III moves from the state level to the local level, where the challenges <b>of</b> operating <b>time-limited</b> welfare programs are being faced. Chapter 4 examines the planning and start-up <b>of</b> the three <b>time-limit</b> programs, focusing special attentioa on computerized management information systems, which played a key role. Chapter 5 focuses on communication of the new message of welfare to recipients and discusses how to explain the new policies and their implications for recipients and to change the day-to-day operation of the welfare system.

40|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>time-limited</b> psychosocial {{interventions}} targeting social skills, internalizing {{and externalizing}} difficulties {{have been developed for}} children and young people with ASD. Increasingly more evidence is emerging that such interventions are effective in reducing difficulties and improving skills. However, large variability between studies and large individual heterogeneity in outcomes have been reported. Furthermore, there are concerns about the limited generalization of learnt skills. For example, what might be learnt in a training program in a clinical setting may not generalize to the school or home setting or even from one person to the next. In addition, experiences and difficulties in childhood are likely to be different from those in adolescence or adulthood and learnt skills to cope with such difficulties may not be transferable across different developmental periods. Furthermore, very little is known about potential mechanisms of change following these interventions. One possible effective "ingredient" to improve outcomes might be the active role and involvement of caregivers. In this update review paper, we summarize the current empirical evidence for the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>time-limited</b> psychosocial interventions for children and young people with ASD, examine how parents are involved in these interventions and the scientific evidence for the inclusion of caregivers in these interventions.

40|$|In this article, we {{consider}} the stability of two single-server polling models. More specifically, we will state and prove the stability conditions of single-server polling systems operating under the pure and exhaustive exponential time-limited service discipline. These conditions will be proven for the polling system operating under the periodic polling strategy and preemptive service. The stability proof <b>of</b> the pure <b>time-limited</b> discipline is straightforward as stability may be considered for each queue in isolation. The proof for the exhaustive time-limited discipline is more laborious. We follow the line of proof as introduced by Fricker and Jaïbi for a large class of service disciplines. Unfortunately, the preemptive nature <b>of</b> the exhaustive <b>time-limited</b> discipline excludes it from this class {{and as a result}} substantial efforts are required to modify the proof as to allow for preemptive disciplines. Finally, the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the proofs to the Markovian polling strategy is discussed...|$|R

Time limits affect welfare recipients {{both before and after}} their limits are reached.

Once recipients begin to exhaust their benefit entitlements, welfare use falls sharply.

Given changes {{in the labor market}} for less-skilled workers, {{it is not clear that}} this will increase income among these families. The reform proposals would shift antipoverty spending toward work subsidies, child support collection efforts, and subsidized jobs that support mandated employment.
