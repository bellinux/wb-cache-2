40|$|Utilization of {{daylight}} in buildings provides excellent light quality for visual tasks {{as well as}} psychological <b>and</b> biological benefits. <b>Daylighting</b> harvesting results in significant savings in electricity consumption for lighting and creates a higher quality indoor environment. <b>Daylighting</b> simulation <b>and</b> energy simulation tools {{can be used for}} evaluation {{of daylight}}ing systems. Separate simulations of energy <b>and</b> <b>daylighting</b> make it difficult to evaluate the design performance and increase the complexity of design workflow. The long runtime of a daylighting simulation limits the possibility of thorough evaluation of potential daylighting systems. Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop an integrated model for selection of daylighting system with a focus on educational buildings (i. e., classrooms). The model comprised two main components: an expert system module and a design optimization module. The expert system module provided simulation-based <b>daylighting</b> <b>and</b> energy information for three types of commonly used daylighting systems: view window, high window, and skylight. This module assists designers in defining types of <b>daylighting</b> systems <b>and</b> identifying possible options byproviding interactive information. A detailed design optimization module can evaluate <b>daylighting</b> <b>and</b> energy performance for the defined building model. Shading system (overhang and blinds) design was also included in the designoptimization module. This module can optimize blind reflectance, glazing transmittance, and system options and calculate Pareto solutions by using prediction and optimization methods. A tool was developed based on the integrated model. A graphic user interface was provided to facilitate usage of the tool. The daylighting simulation tool, Radiance, was wrapped in Python GUI to make it easyto use. A case study was conducted to illustrate how to use the tool in daylighting design for a classroom and to validate the <b>daylighting</b> <b>and</b> energy usage prediction methods. The validation results show the maximum errors of <b>daylighting</b> <b>and</b> energy usage prediction were less than 5 %. The model provides a fast approach for evaluating <b>daylighting</b> systems <b>and</b> optimizing <b>daylighting</b> system design parameters...|$|R

5|$|In poor conditions, {{the weight}} of the adrenal gland may {{increase}} up to 200%, and rice rats are unable to conserve water well when dehydrated, and in water contaminated with oil, they swim less and their mortality increases. The median amount of radiation needed to kill a marsh rice rat is 5.25Gy and the lethal dose of potassium cyanide is 7.20mg/kg; both values are relatively low for cricetid rodents. In one study, wild rice rats in radioactively contaminated areas did not show signs of disease. Exposure to more <b>daylight</b> <b>and</b> higher food availability cause increased development of the gonads in both adult and juvenile rice rats. When the pineal gland is removed or melatonin is administered in male rice rats, the testes are reduced and tend to regress into the body.|$|E
5|$|Miles served {{throughout}} the Greece campaign {{and played a}} key role in the organisation of the withdrawal of the division as it retreated ahead of the advancing Germans. His artillery allowed the New Zealand infantry to defend against attacks in <b>daylight</b> <b>and</b> then withdraw at night. The artillery was particularly vital in covering the undefended high ground on the flanks of 6th Infantry Brigade as it manned a holding position at Thermopylae. Miles was mentioned in despatches for his work during this period. and was also awarded the Greek Cross of Valour. He briefly took command of all New Zealand forces on Crete, to where the bulk of the division had been evacuated from Greece, but after a few days went on to Egypt and missed the subsequent Battle of Crete. Some of his artillery units had also left Crete, albeit without much of their equipment, prior to the fighting.|$|E

40|$|Lighting design {{involves}} {{the consideration of}} multiple performance criteria, from the earliest stages of conceptual design, through various stages of controls and operation in a project's life cycle. These criteria include: (1) the quantitative analysis of illuminance and luminance distribution due to <b>daylighting</b> <b>and</b> electric lighting; (2) qualitative analysis of the lighting design with photometrically accurate renderings of the designed environment; (3) analysis of energy implications of <b>daylighting</b> <b>and</b> electric lighting design and operation;, and (4) analysis of control strategies and sensor placement for maximizing energy savings from lighting control while providing visual comfort. In this paper we describe {{the development of an}} integrated decision-making environment that brings together several different tools, and provides the data management and process control required for a multi-criterion support of the design <b>and</b> operation of <b>daylighting</b> <b>and</b> electric lighting systems. The result is a powerful design and decision-making environment to meet the diverse and evolving needs of lighting designers and operators...|$|R
5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and lights, and the heliograph. In open warfare, visual signalling (employing signal flags and the heliograph) was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 {{words a minute}} with signal flags (during <b>daylight)</b> <b>and</b> signal lights (at night). Signal lights, which were secured in a wooden case, employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by signal lights could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|The 15/16 June 1944 raid on Yawata {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the USAAF's strategic bombing campaign against Japan. The city was struck again by B-29s during <b>daylight</b> <b>and</b> night raids on 20August, but no serious damage was caused. XX Bomber Command conducted 49 raids from its bases in China and India between June 1944 and March 1945, of which nine were made on targets in the Japanese home islands, but Operation Matterhorn did not achieve its goals. Despite initial problems, XXI Bomber Command's operations from the Mariana Islands, which began on 28October 1944, proved much more effective. As a result, XX Bomber Command was transferred to the Mariana Islands in early 1945. Yawata was targeted again by B-29s on 8August 1945, two days after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. On this day the city was attacked by 221 B-29s escorted by three groups of P-47N Thunderbolt fighters including the 318th fighter group based on Ie Shima off the coast of Okinawa. The bombers were armed with incendiary bombs and the resulting firestorm destroyed 21percent of Yawata's urban area.|$|E
5|$|The kakapo {{was a very}} {{successful}} species in pre-human New Zealand, {{and one of the}} reasons for this was their set of adaptations to effectively avoid predation from native birds of prey, which were their only predators in the past. However, these same behaviours have been of no use to them when faced with the mammalian predators which were introduced to New Zealand after human settlement, because these hunt in different ways. As hunters, birds behave very differently from mammals, relying on their powerful vision to find prey, and thus they usually (with the exception of owls) hunt by day. Apart from the two surviving New Zealand raptors, the New Zealand falcon and swamp harrier, there were two other birds of prey in pre-human New Zealand: Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier. All four species soared overhead searching for prey in <b>daylight,</b> <b>and</b> to avoid these avian predators, the kakapo's ancestors adopted camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal. In addition, when the kakapo feels threatened, it freezes, so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the forest vegetation which their plumage resembles. It was not entirely safe at night, when the laughing owl was active, and it is apparent from their nest deposits on Canterbury limestone cliffs that the kakapo was among their prey.|$|E

Behind its positions on Sibidang-san the main supply route and rear areas were in North Korean hands, and only in <b>daylight</b> <b>and</b> under escort could vehicles travel the road. On Sibidang-san the battalion had held its original positions after the heavy fighting of September 1, completely surrounded by barbed wire, booby traps, and flares, with all supporting weapons inside its tight perimeters. The battalion had the advantage of calling for protective artillery fire covering all approaches. An hour after midnight a North Korean assault struck the battalion. The fight there continued until dawn September 3, when the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, counted 143 North Korean dead in front of its positions, and on that basis estimated that the total North Korean casualties must have been about 500 men. The 35th units also had the advantage of well-constructed strong points throughout the battle which the North Koreans could not penetrate.|$|E
