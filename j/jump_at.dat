5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{can live}} {{for more than}} 40 years. Females typically live 5-10 years longer than males, with some females exceeding 60 years. This extreme age is rare and less than 2% of all Bottlenose dolphins will live longer than 60 years. Bottlenose Dolphin can <b>jump</b> <b>at</b> a height of 6 meters (20 feet) up in the air; they use this to communicate with one another.|$|E
5|$|Because of his long-running {{television}} {{career and}} eccentric demeanour, Moore was widely recognised {{and became a}} popular public figure. In 1976 {{it was used to}} good effect for an April Fools' Day spoof on BBC Radio 2, when Moore announced a once-in-a-lifetime astronomical event that meant that if listeners could <b>jump</b> <b>at</b> that exact moment, 9.47 a.m. they would experience a temporary sensation of weightlessness. The BBC received many telephone calls from listeners alleging they experienced the sensation. He was a key figure in the establishment of the International Birdman event in Bognor Regis, which was initially held in Selsey.|$|E

50|$|Competitors {{may begin}} <b>jumping</b> <b>at</b> any height {{announced}} by the chief judge, or may pass, at their own discretion. Three consecutive missed <b>jumps,</b> <b>at</b> any height or combination of heights, will eliminate the jumper from competition.|$|R
50|$|For the Hunter Seat {{divisions}}, the novice, intermediate, {{and open}} divisions have both flat work and work over fences. Novice division <b>jumps</b> are set <b>at</b> 2’-2’3”, intermediate <b>jumps</b> <b>at</b> 2’6”-2’9”, and open <b>jumps</b> <b>at</b> 2’9”-3’. The novice courses {{tend to be}} very straight forward while the open courses require more challenging patterns such as bending lines or rollback turns.|$|R
5|$|During high school, Munnerlyn {{was also}} a {{standout}} track & field sprinter. He competed in the 100-meter dash and long <b>jump</b> <b>at</b> the 2004 Junior Olympics. In 2006, he earned a second-place finish {{in the long jump}} event at the AHSAA State T Meet, recording a career-best leap of 6.85 meters (22ft, 4.75 in). He clocked personal-best times of 10.53 seconds in the 100-meter dash and 22.39 seconds in the 200-meter dash as a senior.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{decided that}} the train {{journeys}} and frozen limbs were too much for his son, so he sent Bill to St Patrick's College, Goulburn as a boarder in 1921, where he quickly showed his athletic flair by becoming {{a member of the}} school's rugby league, tennis, athletics and cricket teams. He held a state record for the triple <b>jump.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, he also represented the town team. During his time at St Patrick's, O'Reilly developed his ruthless and parsimonious attitude towards bowling. After three years at the Irish Catholic school, funded by a scholarship, O'Reilly completed his Leaving Certificate.|$|E
5|$|Ward was the Michigan High School Athlete of the Year, {{after setting}} a {{national}} prep {{record in the}} high <b>jump.</b> <b>At</b> the University of Michigan, he was a collegiate champion in the high jump, the long jump, the 100-yard dash, and the 440-yard dash, and {{finished second in the}} voting for the Associated Press Big Ten Athlete of the Year award in 1933. In track and field he was a three-time All-American and eight-time Big Ten champion.|$|E

5|$|At the 2009 World Championships, Lysacek placed {{second in}} the short program. He then won the free skating segment to win the {{competition}} overall, becoming the first American man since Todd Eldredge in 1996 to win the World title. His placement, combined with that of Brandon Mroz, qualified the United States for three entries in the men's event at the 2010 Winter Olympics. At the World Championships, Lysacek competed with a stress fracture in his left foot, which prevented him from trying a quadruple <b>jump</b> <b>at</b> the competition. During the off-season, Lysacek took two months off from skating to give the injury time to heal. He was called the frontrunner for the 2010 Olympic gold by some journalists.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Kestin and Persen {{published}} a paper describing solutions for heat transfer when the thermal boundary layer is contained entirely within the momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions. For {{the problem of}} a flat plate with a temperature <b>jump</b> <b>at</b> , they propose a substitution that reduces the parabolic thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation. The solution to this equation, the temperature {{at any point in}} the fluid, can be expressed as an incomplete gamma function. Schlichting proposed an equivalent substitution that reduces the thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation whose solution is the same incomplete gamma function.|$|E
5|$|To {{give the}} paratroops some {{artillery}} support, Lieutenant Colonel Alan Blyth of the 2/4th Field Regiment proposed dropping {{some of its}} eight short 25-pounders by parachute. A call went out for volunteers and four officers and 30 other ranks were selected. On 30 August, Vasey watched them carry out a practice <b>jump</b> <b>at</b> Rogers Airfield. This {{turned out to be}} the easy part. Brand new guns were received from the 10th Advanced Ordnance Depot at Port Moresby on 23 August. Two were handed over for training while, as a precaution, the remaining six were sent the 2/117th Field Workshops for inspection and checking. All six were condemned, owing to a number of serious defects in assembly and manufacture. On 30 August, the gunners received orders to move out the next day, so the 2/51st Light Aid Detachment cannibalised six guns to produce two working guns, which were proofed by firing 20 rounds per gun. Only one was ready in time to leave with the gunners so the other followed on a special flight. Eight of the 2/4th Field Regiment’s Mark II 25-pounders were also condemned owing to the presence of filings in the buffer system. Vasey was less than impressed.|$|E

5|$|Vertical jumps (high {{jump and}} pole vault) set a bar at a {{particular}} height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, {{which can be used}} to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, {{by the total number of}} misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth <b>jump</b> <b>at</b> the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.|$|E
