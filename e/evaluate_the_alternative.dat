50|$|Uphoff is a {{subject-matter}} expert in development administration, irrigation management, local participation, {{and strategies for}} broad-based rural development. His interests have expanded beyond the social sciences to include new knowledge and practice in soil science and microbiology. In 1993 he became acquainted in Madagascar with the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) through the NGO Association Tefy Saina. Farmers who used SRI methods, having gotten paddy yields averaging only 2 tons/hectare paddy with their usual methods, on soil that was evaluated as 'very poor,' without using new varieties and without depending on chemical fertilizer, and with less water, were able to average 8 tons/hectare. After such results were attained for three consecutive years, and were seen {{in other parts of}} Madagascar as well, Uphoff began trying to get agricultural specialists in other countries to use and <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> SRI methods for themselves. In 1999-2000, SRI results were validated by rice scientists in China and Indonesia, and since then, the testing and dissemination of SRI has spread to almost 50 countries, showing how more rice can be produced with less water, less cost, and often less labor. But this agroecological methodology has not been without its critics and opponents.|$|E

Generally, lower operating costs can compensate higher capital expenditures meaning that the owner should carefully evaluate the total cost of ownership of the various alternatives, and not consider only the initial capital expenditure. The choice of best technology option depends on a variety of issues which can change over time - such as the operation profile and route of the vessel and commodity prices.

40|$|Abstract — Bayesian {{filtering}} is {{a general}} framework for recursively estimating the state of a dynamical system. The most common instantiations of Bayes filters are Kalman filters (extended and unscented) and particle filters. Key components of each Bayes filter are probabilistic prediction and observation models. Recently, Gaussian processes have been introduced as a non-parametric technique for learning such models from training data. In the context of unscented Kalman filters, these models {{have been shown to}} provide estimates that can be superior to those achieved with standard, parametric models. In this paper we show how Gaussian process models can be integrated into other Bayes filters, namely particle filters and extended Kalman filters. We provide a complexity analysis of these filters and <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> techniques using data collected with an autonomous micro-blimp. I...|$|E

40|$|Non-functional {{requirements}} are critical in web engineering applications, but often ignored. Usually, these are articulated as statements of objectives, {{as opposed to}} prepositional assertions. A key challenge in dealing with objectives {{is that there is}} no obvious means of deciding when they are satisfied. In effect, these objectives are never fully satisfied, but satisficed to varying degrees. Alternative design decisions need to trade-off varying degrees of satisfaction of potentially mutually contradictory non-functional requirements. The key contribution of this paper is the use of the hierarchical constraint logic programming framework [3, 6] in dealing with non-functional requirements. We show how NFRs can be formulated as soft constraints and how the machinery associated with constraint hierarchies can be used to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> trade-offs involved in seeking to satisfy a set of non-functional requirements that might pull in different directions...|$|E
