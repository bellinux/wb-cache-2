5|$|During Operation Guardian II a {{squadron}} was deployed {{to protect the}} March 2002 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in south-east Queensland. During this, the Australian Defence Force pilots were given permission to destroy any hostile aircraft. This has not happened {{at any time during}} Australian peace time, but was <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> because of the 11 September 2001 attacks six months earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to base the creatures on real animals was made early on. To offer players variety, {{a mixture of}} benign and aggressive creatures was <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary.</b> The team decided to implement anthropomorphised bipedal animals, because their humanoid form evoked empathy, and credibility in their potential sentience. Due to technical restraints, bipedal creatures also provided greater flexibility for animation and game dynamics.|$|E

5|$|On 31 August boats from Alceste put {{the party}} ashore at Ostia, near Rome, where they {{made contact with}} a {{representative}} of the Vatican who agreed to speak to the Pope but failed to return. When it was <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> to travel to Rome to re-establish contact, the priests refused to go. Maxwell sent them back to Palermo in Acorn, which returned a week later with another volunteer of Drummond's. Landed on the night of 19 September, the envoy was captured and shot as a spy the following day. Consequently, the entire plan was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The {{chief of}} {{construction}} of Auschwitz II-Birkenau was Karl Bischoff. Unlike his predecessor, {{he was a}} competent and dynamic bureaucrat who, {{in spite of the}} ongoing war, carried out the construction <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary.</b> The Birkenau camp, the four crematoria, a new reception building, and hundreds of other buildings were planned and constructed. Bischoff's plans called for each barrack to have an occupancy of 550 prisoners (one-third of the space allotted in other Nazi concentration camps). He later changed this to 744 prisoners per barrack. The SS designed the barracks not so much to house people as to destroy them.|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships were}} officially laid down on 19 December 1912, but work {{did not begin}} until Marchâ€“April 1913. After a {{progress}} review on 4 June 1914, launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began, the hull of Izmail, the most advanced ship, was judged 43percent complete, with the others lagging considerably behind. The war caused more delays, including problems obtaining imported components, and the ships were competing for scarce resources with other production <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> for the war. Three of the four ships were launched in 1915, {{but it was clear}} that Russian industry {{would not be able to}} complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed. They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.|$|E

5|$|Although {{all of its}} {{components}} had been tested in target and drop tests, no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before Hiroshima. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was insufficient uranium-235. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough {{that it was only}} <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work. Thirty-two drop tests were conducted at Wendover, and only once did the bomb fail to fire. One last-minute modification was made, to allow the powder bags of propellant that fired the gun to be loaded in the bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|Although {{all of its}} {{components}} had been tested, no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before the Little Boy was dropped over Hiroshima. The only test explosion of a nuclear weapon concept had been of an implosion-type device employing plutonium as its fissile material, and took place on 16 July 1945 at the Trinity nuclear test. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was little uranium-235 {{as compared with the}} relatively large amount of plutonium which, it was expected, could be produced by the Hanford Site reactors. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough that it was only <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century the fabric of the church had also deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} serious remedial work was <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary.</b> Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E

5|$|Electric vehicle {{warning sounds}} are {{a series of}} sounds {{designed}} to alert pedestrians to the presence of electric drive vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) travelling at low speeds. Warning sound devices were <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> by some government regulators because vehicles operating in all-electric mode produce less noise than traditional combustion engine vehicles and can {{make it more difficult for}} pedestrians, the blind, cyclists, and others, to be aware of their presence. Warning sounds may be driver triggered (as in a horn but less urgent) or automatic at low speeds; in type, they vary from clearly artificial (beeps, chimes) to those that mimic engine sounds and those of tires moving over gravel.|$|E
5|$|Following his triumph, Germanicus {{was sent}} to Asia to reorganize the provinces and kingdoms of Asia, which were in such disarray that the {{attention}} of a domus Augusta was <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> to settle matters. Germanicus was given imperium maius (extraordinary command) over the other governors and commanders of the area he was to operate; however, Tiberius had replaced the governor of Syria with Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, who was meant to be his helper (adiutor), but turned out to be hostile. According to Tacitus, this was an attempt to separate Germanicus from his familiar troops and weaken his influence, but the historian Richard Alston says Tiberius had little reason to undermine his heir.|$|E
5|$|In {{designing}} the 777 {{as its first}} fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls, the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models. The fly-by-wire system also incorporates flight envelope protection, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of operating parameters, acting to prevent stalls, overspeeds, and excessively stressful maneuvers. This system can be overridden by the pilot if <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary.</b> The fly-by-wire system is supplemented by mechanical backup.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{widening}} the existing structure, the Minister for Transport, Eric Charlton, on 15 July 1998 approved {{the construction of}} a separate second road bridge alongside the original Narrows Bridge; this solution would cost $15 million less, due to new building techniques, and would be less disruptive to traffic on the existing bridge. The construction of a separate bridge was also <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> because the foundations of any new structure might settle in the soft river bed at a different rate to the existing bridge. Under the plan, there would be six lanes on each bridge, including a bus lane on each. The new bridge would run parallel to the original bridge and be separated from it by a gap of , and was designed to look largely the same as the original.|$|E
5|$|On 14 April 2005 the Singapore Police Force {{announced}} plans to step up rail security by establishing a specialised security unit for public transport, the unit today {{is known as the}} Public Transport Security Command or more commonly known as TRANSCOM. These armed officers began overt patrols on the MRT and LRT systems on 15 August 2005, conducting random patrols in pairs in and around rail stations and within trains. They are trained and authorised to use their firearms at their discretion, including deadly force if <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary.</b> On 8 January 2006, a major civil exercise involving over 2,000 personnel from 22 government agencies, codenamed Exercise Northstar V, simulating bombing and chemical attacks at Dhoby Ghaut, Toa Payoh, Raffles Place and Marina Bay MRT stations was conducted. Thirteen stations were closed and about 3,400 commuters were affected during the three-hour exercise.|$|E
5|$|The 19th Air Brigade's {{primary mission}} was to defend the {{industrial}} facilities in northern KyÅ«shÅ«, and particularly the iron works at Yawata. The brigade's plans {{for the defense of}} the Western District called for its interceptor aircraft to be concentrated over Yawata and not move far from the area. While this inflexible deployment was considered unsatisfactory by the 19th Air Brigade, it was <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> as few aircraft were available, the only searchlight units needed to facilitate night operations were stationed near Yawata and northern KyÅ«shÅ« was regarded by the Army as being the most important region in the Western District. Prior to the raid on Yawata the 19th Air Brigade undertook joint planning with anti-aircraft units and implemented a training program which included practice in responding to alerts and night flying.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} of the ruling {{in this case was}} that it tested the constitutionality of the Act and confirmed Congress' authority over Indian affairs. Plenary power over Indian tribes, supposedly granted to the U.S. Congress by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, was not <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> to support the Supreme Court in this decision; instead, the Court found the power in the tribes' status as dependent domestic nations. This allowed Congress to pass the Dawes Act the following year. The case has been criticized by legal scholars as drawing on powers that are not granted to Congress by the Constitution. It remains , despite that criticism.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{reasons for}} the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, {{he was no longer}} in an {{official}} position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a proconsul. When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary.</b> When he relinquished his annual consulship, he legally lost this power because his proconsular powers applied only to his imperial provinces. Augustus wanted to keep this power.|$|E
5|$|There are {{competing}} views over the appropriate {{role of the}} judiciary in matters concerning preventive detention under the ISA. A related concern is whether the judicial process is suitable for such matters. The legislative and constitutional amendments relating to judicial review under the ISA were intended to limit {{the role of the}} courts in national security matters. In 1989, Law Minister S. Jayakumar argued in Parliament that the amendments were needed because the courts would effectively be responsible for national security matters if judicial review was permitted. The subjective test was <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> to reserve to the executive the responsibility for national security matters, and to enable the Government to deal effectively with security threats.|$|E
