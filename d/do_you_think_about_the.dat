60|$|I don't like to {{send you}} a letter from Paris without a word about your hero--'handsome,' I fancy not, nor the {{imperial}} type. I have not seen his face distinctly. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> constitution? Will it work, do you fancy, now-a-days in France? The initiative of the laws, put out {{of the power of the}} legislative assembly, seems to me a stupidity; and the senators, in their fine dresses, make me wink a little. Also, I hear that the 'senatorial cardinals' don't please the peasants, who hate the priesthood as much as they hate the 'Cossacks.' On the other hand, Montalembert was certainly in bed the other day with vexation, because 'nobody could do anything with Louis Napoleon--he was obstinate;' 'nous nous en lavons les mains,' and that fact gives me hope that not too much indulgence is intended to the Church. There's to be a ball at the Tuileries with 'court dresses,' which is 'un peu fort' for a republic. By the way, rumour (with apparent authority justifying it) says, that a black woman opened her mouth and prophesied to him at Ham, 'he should be the head of the French nation, and be assassinated in a ball-room.' I was assured that he believes the prophecy firmly, 'being in all things too superstitious' and fatalistical.|$|E

50|$|Melody's first 'ethnographic' {{work was}} her 2009 exhibition, Demographics of a Pigeon Fancier (Crab Fair, West Cumbria; The Basement, Brighton). This {{was the result}} of months spent living with British pigeon fanciers during the racing season. In her research, she {{gathered}} data using film, interviews, photography and notes. Melody was interested in the homes fanciers lived in, how much they weighed, and how their hobby affected relationships with family and friends. She met the pigeons and collected fanciers' anecdotes, stories and poems. The show also became a dialogue about regional differences between people living in Egremont, Cumbria, and Brighton. Cumbrians were asked, 'Northerners what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> South?' and Brightonians were asked, 'Southerners, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> North?' The responses were then delivered to Cumbria and Brighton by homing pigeons.|$|E

Songs that appear on the album that were released as singles prior to the albums release include [...] "Paracetamol", [...] "Isombard", and [...] "The Kids Don't Wanna Come Home", which peaked at number 84 on Belgium's Ultratop Flanders chart.

5000|$|McKenna {{appeared}} on BBC Musics [...] "Sound of 2017" [...] list {{at the end}} of 2016, after releasing the two EPs Stains and Liar that year. The EPs had similar tracklists, with [...] "Brazil" [...] and [...] "Paracetamol" [...] appearing on both. McKenna would release two more singles, [...] "The Kids Dont Wanna Come Home" [...] and [...] "Humongous," [...] before releasing his debut album, titled What <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> Car?. English musician, record producer and composer James Ford, who had produced albums by Arctic Monkeys, Depeche Mode, and Florence and the Machine, produced the album, which was being recorded at a Kensal Green recording studio. The album was released on July 21, 2017 and received generally positive reviews. It featured all six of McKennas previously released singles, as well as five new tracks. All songs on the album were written by McKenna alone, with the exception of [...] "Listen to Your Friends," [...] which was co-written with Rostam Batmanglij. McKenna is set to play at various festivals in 2017, including Coachella, Lollapalooza, Glastonbury Festival and Reading and Leeds Festival ...|$|E
5000|$|What <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> Car? {{has been}} {{described}} as featuring indie rock throughout. In 2015, at age 15, McKenna won the Glastonbury Festival's Emerging Talent Competition, and started writing songs for the album soon after, while still in school. Writing went on for 2 years. McKenna says, [...] "There were a lot of changes, and I think you can hear that within some of the songs on the record. Quite {{a big part of the}} album is about change and being confused". He composed most of the album in his bedroom, except [...] "Listen To Your Friends", which was written in Los Angeles. [...] "Brazil" [...] was written when he was 15. McKenna says, [...] "The album is about me being playful and positive about not necessarily happy topics ... That's what I'm like as a character. I try not to be too distant from serious topics as well. The two go together." [...] "Paracetamol" [...] was written after learning about the suicide of transgender teen Leelah Alcorn and the media's representation of LGBT communities in general.|$|E

3000|$|The {{second phase}} of {{fieldwork}} was conducted in 2011 by an anthropologist and included eight interviews centred on the contemporary scientific publications on moths, reindeer and mountain birches (e.g. Klemola et al. 2003, Klemola 2009, Tømmervik et al. 2009, Ammunét 2011). The results put forward in these publications were presented in popular form to the herders, who were asked key questions such as: What {{do you think if}} outbreaks of both autumnal and winter moth become more common as the climate gets warmer? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> impact of global warming and reindeer on the growth of birch trees? What {{do you think of the}} future of reindeer herding?

3000|$|In addition, {{the survey}} {{participants}} were asked two sets of questions related to their feelings over the disaster and various issues of disaster management. [...]. Major question “What are your feelings over the disaster?” was asked {{in the form of}} 9 statements. Similarly, 18 statements were asked to respond for another set of major question “What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> following issues (18 statements) for disaster management”. They were asked to indicate their responses in various statements (included in the two major question sets as most probable answers) in five levels: (1) Strongly disagree, (2) Disagree, (3) Agree, (4) Strongly agree, and (5) I do not know. Later in the analysis phase, the statements were categorized into five groups to explore knowledge of respondents on DRR as (i) Disaster-related knowledge, (ii) Disaster preparedness and readiness, (iiii) Disaster adaptation, (iv) Disaster awareness, (v) Disaster risk perception. A summary of the statements incorporated in the questionnaire survey is as follows.|$|E
