5|$|Greek {{cultural}} influence did {{not disappear}} from the Parthian Empire, however, and {{there is evidence that}} the Arsacids enjoyed Greek theatre. When the head of Crassus was brought to Orodes II, he, alongside Armenian king Artavasdes II, were busy watching a performance of The Bacchae by the playwright Euripides (c.480–406 BC).

5|$|On 9 May 1945, {{only two}} Panzer IVs were left. Romania {{received}} another 50 Panzer IV tanks from the Red Army {{after the end}} of the war. These tanks were of different models and were in very poor shape—many of them were missing parts and the side skirts. The T4 tanks remained in service until 1950, when the Army <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> only Soviet equipment. By 1954, all German tanks had been scrapped.|$|E

Phil <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> some aliens in the plot he was given and a chase down Buckingham Palace.

Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried to act {{in the best interests of}} Norway and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this as a starting point for the defence.|$|E

5|$|After two years, Glidden {{abandoned}} {{production of}} cortisone {{to concentrate on}} Substance S. Julian developed a multistep process for conversion of pregnenolone, available in abundance from soybean oil sterols, to cortexolone. In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing progesterone and other steroids from soybean oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex). Glidden's cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydrocortisone.|$|E

However, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters had anticipated that the Allies would conduct bombardments and other operations with this goal, and decided to not attack naval forces operating off Japan. Instead, the aircraft would remain in reserve until Allied landing operations in the home islands began.|$|E
