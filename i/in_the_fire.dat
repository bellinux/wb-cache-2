5|$|Investigators {{confirmed}} that {{the site of the}} fire had been used as an illegal factory to manufacture leather bags. The factory was located {{on the third floor of}} a four-story building, which also featured residential units.

The factory destroyed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was found to be owned and operated by Tenex Exports, and all of the people who were killed or injured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> slept in the factory at night, a situation that is not considered unusual in India. There was had just one emergency exit, and 40 workers were housed in the structure at the time of the fire, and the owner had locked the factory at night to prevent workers from running away with leather goods.

5|$|Abandoned {{by their}} father {{deep in a}} forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a {{gingerbread}} house and are captured by a cannibalistic witch. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy to fatten him up, and enslaves Gretel by ordering her to prepare the oven. The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> of the oven. In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed witch hunters, slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel diabetic.

5|$|According to Dawlatshah, Abdollah-ibn-Tahir, an Arabicized Persian, and {{governor}} of Khorasan for the Abbasid caliphs, banned publication in Persian {{and by his}} order all the Zoroastrians were forced to bring their religious books to be thrown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> As a result, many literary works written in Pahlavi script disappeared. During the Abbasid reign the Zoroastrians, {{for the first time}} became a minority in Iran. Nevertheless, there were instances of toleration during the Abbasid era, particularly under the reign of Al-Mu'tasim who flogged an imam and muezzin for destroying a fire-temple and replacing it with a mosque.|$|E
5|$|According to Hindu legend, Sati, the {{daughter}} of Prajapati Daksha, married Shiva against the wish of Daksha. Daksha organised a great yajna (sacrifice), but did not invite Sati and Shiva. Uninvited, Sati reached the yajna-site, where Daksha ignored Sati and vilified Shiva. Unable to withstand this insult, Sati sacrificed herself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> The wild, grief-stricken Shiva wandered the universe with her half-burnt corpse. Finally, Vishnu dismembered her body into 51 parts, each of which fell on different places on the earth, each creating a Shakti Pitha.|$|E
40|$|Research {{on network}} {{mechanisms}} and coding properties of grid cells assume that <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> rate of a grid cell {{in each of}} its fields is the same. Furthermore, proposed network models predict spatial regularities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> of inhibitory interneurons that are inconsistent with experimental data. In this paper, by analyzing the response of grid cells recorded from rats during free navigation, we first show that there are strong variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mean <b>firing</b> rate of <b>the</b> fields of individual grid cells and thus show that the data is inconsistent with the theoretical models that predict similar peak magnitudes. We then build a two population excitatory-inhibitory network model in which sparse spatially selective input to the excitatory cells, presumed to arise from e. g. salient external stimuli, hippocampus {{or a combination of}} both, leads to <b>the</b> variability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> field amplitudes of grid cells. We show that, when combined with appropriate connectivity between the excitatory and inhibitory neurons, <b>the</b> variability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> field amplitudes of grid cells results in inhibitory neurons that do not exhibit regular spatial firing, consistent with experimental data. Finally, we show that even if the spatial positions of the fields are maintained, variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> rates of <b>the</b> fields of grid cells are enough to cause remapping of hippocampal cells...|$|R
