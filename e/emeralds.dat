5|$|In {{an attempt}} to steal the six Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> and harness their power, the game's antagonist, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, has trapped the animal {{inhabitants}} of South Island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules. The player controls Sonic, who aims to halt Robotnik's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the <b>emeralds</b> himself. If the player collects all the Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> and completes the game, an ending sequence is shown. If all the <b>emeralds</b> are not collected, Robotnik taunts the player while juggling any of the Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> not collected by the player.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary had the tiara {{altered to}} {{accommodate}} 15 of the Cambridge cabochon <b>emeralds.</b> The original drop pearls {{can easily be}} replaced {{as an alternative to}} the <b>emeralds.</b> Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara directly from her grandmother in 1953. It is almost exclusively worn together with the Cambridge and Delhi Durbar parures, also containing large <b>emeralds.</b> Elizabeth wore the tiara in her official portrait as Queen of Canada as none of the Commonwealth realms besides the United Kingdom have their own crown jewels.|$|E
5|$|However, the unfazed Eggman awakens a {{creature}} named Chaos from a huge gem called the Master Emerald. The animals fight {{a losing battle}} to retrieve the <b>Emeralds</b> until Chaos absorbs all seven and becomes giant, but an echidna girl named Tikal, who entombed herself and Chaos in the Master Emerald millennia ago, emerges to help placate him. After Sonic uses the Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> to become Super Sonic, he defeats Chaos, who returns to the Master Emerald with Tikal.|$|E

50|$|<b>Emerald</b> Lake Hills was {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} resort community for city-weary San Franciscans during World War I. <b>Emerald</b> Lake Hills actually consists of two large subdivisions created around 1920: <b>Emerald</b> Lake (even though there are two lakes) and <b>Emerald</b> Hills. Residents refer to the area by either <b>Emerald</b> Hills or by <b>Emerald</b> Lake Hills. The name <b>Emerald</b> Hills is now more commonly adopted due to mailing designation rules, as the U. S. Post Office would allow only a two-word name.|$|R
50|$|<b>Emerald</b> has ten schools: six primary schools, three {{secondary}} schools, and {{a distance}} education school. There are three public primary schools, Denison State School, <b>Emerald</b> North State School, and <b>Emerald</b> State School.

5|$|The final boss fight {{takes place}} at the Altar Emerald temple. If the player defeats Eggman there without having all seven Chaos <b>Emeralds,</b> Eggman and Gemerl escape and fall {{off the edge of the}} temple. Peace is {{restored}} to the world, and Omochao snaps a picture of the five heroes. However, the game alerts the player that the <b>Emeralds</b> must still be collected for the true ending. If the player defeats Eggman at the temple with all the Chaos <b>Emeralds,</b> Gemerl stops running away with Eggman and attacks Sonic, causing the <b>Emeralds</b> to scatter. Gemerl uses them to take on a giant, orb-shaped form, but Sonic also uses their power to attain his Super Sonic form. With Eggman's help, Super Sonic destroys Gemerl. Tails later finds Gemerl's broken body on a beach, repairing and reprogramming it. The game ends as Cream plays with the now non-aggressive Gemerl at her mother Vanilla's house.|$|E

After completing the first zone, Sonic finds a robot resembling Tails—a trap sprung by Eggman. The robot ensnares Sonic in a forcefield while Eggman steals Sonic's Chaos <b>Emeralds.</b> Sonic escapes and sets out with Tails to recover the <b>Emeralds.</b>|$|E

He fights the robot as the game's final boss. After its defeat, Sonic and Tails fly aboard the Tornado once more—the segue into the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 3.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the game's events, Doctor Eggman {{builds a}} robotic {{assistant}} named Gemerl, using parts from the robot Emerl who {{was destroyed in}} Sonic Battle. Eggman attempts an experiment using the Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> to perform the Chaos Control technique, but it goes awry and tears the world apart. This action separates Sonic and Tails from Amy, Knuckles, and Cream, all of whom Eggman finds and captures, intending to create a segment of his impending empire on each chunk of the planet. Sonic and Tails travel through the game's seven levels to recapture their friends and retrieve the <b>Emeralds.</b>|$|E

5|$|The game {{progresses}} {{through the}} Westopolis level and five more levels {{from the different}} paths Shadow may take. As missions are completed, Shadow learns more about his past and regains memories. He can choose to help Doctor Eggman or the Black Arms, to help G.U.N. and the series' heroic characters, or to help neither and keep the Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> for himself. The missions completed determine which one of ten possible endings will be seen after Shadow collects all the Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> and defeats one of the game's final bosses. The possible ending events range from planning to defeat the Black Arms to planning to destroy the planet.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Shadow suffers from amnesia. Other than the events of Sonic Heroes that took place three months prior, Shadow remembers only two things: his name and his attempt to escape the space colony ARK with his creator's granddaughter Maria, who was killed by G.U.N. soldiers. Having walked through a room filled with androids that looked like him during the events of Sonic Heroes, Shadow wonders if he too is an android. The game starts with Shadow reminiscing outside the city of Westopolis when the alien race Black Arms drops out of the sky and invades the city. One Black Arms alien, Doom's Eye, approaches Shadow, and the Black Arms's leader Black Doom tells Shadow of an old agreement Shadow made: to bring Black Doom the Chaos <b>Emeralds.</b> Stunned that Black Doom knew his name, Shadow searches for the Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> to learn about his past.|$|E

5|$|Early {{analyses}} of <b>emeralds</b> and beryls by Martin Heinrich Klaproth, Torbern Olof Bergman, Franz Karl Achard, and Johann Jakob Bindheim always yielded similar elements, {{leading to the}} fallacious conclusion that both substances are aluminium silicates.

5|$|Knuckles' {{story begins}} in Mushroom Hill, {{where he is}} {{relaxing}} with his animal friends but is interrupted by a bomb dropped by EggRobo. This prompts Knuckles to chase after him, leading him {{through most of the}} same zones Sonic went through. The chase ends at the damaged remains of Sky Sanctuary, where a robot called Mecha Sonic attacks Knuckles but accidentally destroys EggRobo instead. After a short fight, Mecha Sonic uses the power of the Master Emerald to achieve a Super form similar to Sonic's. Knuckles manages to defeat Super Mecha Sonic, who explodes. Sonic flies in piloting the biplane Tornado and Knuckles hitches a ride to return the Master Emerald to Angel Island. If all the Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> are collected, Angel Island rises upwards, into the sky. However, if the player has not collected all the Chaos <b>Emeralds,</b> Knuckles cannot redeem the Master Emerald, and Angel Island plummets into the ocean.|$|E
