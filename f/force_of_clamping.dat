The maximum transmission pile driving <b>force</b> <b>of</b> pile <b>clamping</b> mechanism <b>of</b> hydraulic static pile driver was analyzed.

The contact between prefabricated pile and pile clamping jaws under pile driving was investigated.

40|$|When {{multifunctional}} pipeline repair machinery (MPRM) {{is used in}} {{the deep}} sea area, it is difficult to grip the pipeline and ensure concentricity between the cutter heads and the pipeline during its operation. In view of this, a new system of two-arm holding self-centering pipeline clamping device was proposed. The system is composed of two groups of parallelogram double-rocker mechanism and cranking block mechanism which are symmetrically distributed on the frame. The geometric parameter solutions <b>of</b> the <b>clamping</b> device were analyzed with motion and transmission as the constraints. A mechanical model was established to associate the friction torque <b>of</b> <b>clamping</b> points with the driving force. Clamping device and machinery were designed and manufactured for the Ø 304. 8 – 457. 2  mm pipelines used in this test. ADAMS simulation experiments were conducted underwater, and the cutting and beveling tests were carried out onshore. The following results are achieved. First, the smaller the pipe diameter, the smaller the transmission angle of the oscillating slider mechanism; the longer the hydraulic cylinder stroke, the greater the transmission angle of the double rocker mechanism. Second, the driving <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the <b>clamping</b> device increases with the increase of the pipe diameter. When the diameter reaches 457. 2  mm, the hydraulic cylinder driving <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the <b>clamping</b> device should be greater than 10219  N. Third, the feed rate of the cutters increases suddenly due to the slight shaking of the machinery which occurs {{at the beginning of the}} pipe cutting, so it is necessary to adopt a small feed rate. And fourth, onshore experiment results agree well with the theoretical design and simulation results, proving the rationality of the system. The research results in this paper provide technical basis for the research and development of similar engineering prototypes...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a simple and small thermal link for cooling a cylindrical car-tridge, on which device under test is mounted. It consists of a crown-like ring with an inner diameter of 170 mm or 140 mm and a clamping belt, which is a metal spring or nylon. A thermal conduction of the thermal link is achieved as the crown-like ring clamps the disk-like stage of the cartridge with external <b>force</b> <b>of</b> a <b>clamping</b> belt.

These values are consistent with a empirical calculation within 10 % errors.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{describe}} a soft clamped quasi static fiber bundle model for two dimensional interfacial fracture. The soft clamps distribute the stress amongst the fibers through elastic forces. The model display three distinct modes of damage development {{depending on the}} elasticity <b>of</b> the <b>clamps</b> {{and the distribution of}} fiber strength. 1) The stiff clamp regime: The elastic <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> the <b>clamps</b> are in effect turned off. The model behaves like equal load sharing and damage is developing through random dilution of the system. 2) The soft clamp - quasi brittle regime: The elastic forces are turned on. The strength distribution of the fibers are large enough to affect the damage development. The elastic forces and the heterogeneities of the system are competing. 3) The soft clamp - brittle regime: The distribution of fiber strength is no longer strong enough to compete with the elastic redistribution of stress from the soft clamps. The damage development is determined by the elastic forces. The model is then expanded with a gradient in the distribution of fiber strength to induce a clear fracture front. By this we can show that the model reproduces not only both the different roughness exponents ζ+ = 0. 39 and ζ÷ = 1 / 2, but also the dynamic development of the fracture seen in laboratory experiments.

40|$|A {{manufacturing}} process for crystalline silicon solar cells is presented which consists mainly of electrochemical steps. The deposition of doping glass layers {{for the front}} side emitter {{as well as the}} back surface field is performed anodically onto the etched and cleaned wafers. The doping atoms, phosphorus or boron, are diffused into the silicon crystal in a furnace at 950 Cin an atmosphere of simply clean air. After the diffusion process the front side doping glass has a blue colour and is suitable to serve as an antireflection coating with a very low surface recombination velocity. For this reason, the doping glass is not etched away on the sun exposed regions of the solar cell. The masking technology for all electrochemical processes provides inherently an edge exclusion and, theref ore, no additional processing for preventing shorts on the wafer edge is necessary. For the metallization a reusable rubber mask defines the pattern. First, the mask is used for the doping glass patterning by wet chemical etching. Then, on both sides first nickel is deposited electrolytically directly onto silicon, and in a second step copper electroplating onto the nickel barrier is performed. All three steps, etching, nickel and copper deposition are self adjusting through said rubber mask. A short forming gas anneal finishes the solar cell processing. During all electrochemical processing the wafer is electrically contacted on the opposite surface on a stainless steel plate by the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> vacuum <b>clamping.</b> With this low cost processing 12. 5 % cell efficiency has been achieved on multi -crystalline 156 mmwafers, which originally have a minority carrier lifetime of 4 ls measured after damage etch and thermal oxidation.
