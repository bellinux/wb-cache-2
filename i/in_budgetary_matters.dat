5000|$|During a {{large portion}} of the long tenure of power for the social-democratic (between 1932-1976), the party {{remained}} in control of legislation thanks to its strong position in the first chamber. If the two chambers made contradictory decisions <b>in</b> <b>budgetary</b> <b>matters,</b> they were required to meet in joint assembly to make a [...] "coherent" [...] decision on the issue. In other matters, no legislative outcomes could be established if the two houses were in disagreement, but issues could re-addressed by submitting a new proposal. Co-ordination between the two chambers was facilitated by the fact that the Riksdag had standing joint committees composed of members from both chambers. This is rare for two chamber systems, which generally only employ temporary joint mediation committees to resolve a dispute between the chambers, or reserve standing joint committees for very narrow functions.|$|E
50|$|The {{setting up}} of UNIDO {{as a special}} organ had {{nonetheless}} been a compromise solution. The developing countries (the Group of 77) had {{in the first instance}} promoted the idea of a specialized agency with its own political decision-making governing bodies and autonomy <b>in</b> <b>budgetary</b> <b>matters.</b> The same position was advocated by several high-level expert groups and intergovernmental committees during the following years. In the context of the General Assembly's adoption of the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, UNIDO's second General Conference, held in 1975 in Lima, Peru, adopted the Lima Declaration on Industrial Development and Cooperation. For the first time, industrial development objectives were quantified internationally — the Lima Target anticipated the developing countries to attain a twenty-five per cent share of world industrial production by the year of 2000. As part of the institutional arrangements of the Lima Plan of Action, and with a view to assisting in the establishment of a New International Economic Order, it was recommended to the General Assembly that UNIDO be converted into a specialized agency.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} role of {{parliamentary}} amendment powers in the Budget process from a comparative perspective. It is proposed that the ability of Parliament to change the Budget depends on two sets of necessary conditions: the actual configuration of powers vested in Parliament {{and a set of}} factors determining {{the role of}} committees in the Budget process. It is concluded that even if the South African Parliament were to immediately gain amendment powers <b>in</b> <b>budgetary</b> <b>matters,</b> committees do not yet have the capacity to effectively utilise them. The article therefore proposes the introduction of amendment powers in conjunction with a set of procedural and institutional changes. The aim {{of this paper is to}} understand the role of Parliament in the Budget 1 process. In particular we shall focus on powers of amendment over Money Bills 2 and conditions for effective use of these powers. Why is this an important debate? The Budget is the most important economic policy tool of the Government 3 and provides a comprehensive statement of the nation’s priorities. As the representative of the people, Parliament is the appropriate place to ensure that the Budget best matches the nation’s needs with available resources.

40|$|Little {{attention}} has been paid by health planners or researchers to questions of local public finance. However, {{a review of the literature}} concerning general revenue sharing (GRS) funds indicated that about $ 400 million per year from this source is spent on health services and resources. GRS funds, about $ 6. 4 billion per year, are distributed to more than 39, 000 State, county, and city governments. The 1976 amendments to the General Revenue Sharing Act eliminated restrictions on the use of the funds, and they can be employed as matching funds for other Federal monies. An exploratory study of the use of GRS funds for health purposes was conducted in several localities, with particular attention to the health systems agencies. Its results confirmed that there are wide variations among localities in the use of revenue-sharing funds to support health services. Also, not only did the health systems agencies' officials have little impact on the allocation of revenue sharing funds, but only in one locale had an HSA official taken a direct role <b>in</b> the <b>budgetary</b> process.

40|$|This {{comparative}} study analyses {{the procedure for}} adopting the draft State Budget in the Parliaments of selected member states of the European Union (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Great Britain, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Sweden). The {{aim of this study}} is to outline the possibility for deputies, deputy groups and parliamentary groups to present amendments to the draft State Budget (for example, to present amendments to the total revenues and expenditures, to the structure of the expenditure side etc.). In the United Kingdom and in the Nordic countries, the Governments have a strong competence <b>in</b> <b>budgetary</b> <b>matters</b> and in the process of voting on the budget in the Parliaments, the deputies have limited competence to table amendments to the draft State Budget. Moreover, deputies of coalition parties in the above mentioned countries tend to fully respect the Government proposal and do not submit amendments during discussions in Parliament. On the other hand, deputies in countries such as Belgium, the Slovak Republic and Estonia can have an impact on the state expenditure of the Budget during the voting procedure and in committee discussions; this is evidenced by the fact that the sum of all approved deputy proposals amending the draft State Budget for 2005 exceeded 1 per mille of their GDP. In most other countries, amendments may be tabled by MPs, deputy groups or parliamentary groups. Only in Sweden may amendments to the proposed state budget be submitted only by deputy groups or parliamentary groups (individual MPs can not submit amendments) ...|$|E
40|$|Do {{parliamentary}} parties politicize compliance {{within the}} European Semester? If so, which conflict lines organize parliamentary debates? In {{order to address}} these questions, this discussion paper analyses national parliamentary participation in two budgetary cycles of the European Semester (2014 and 2015) in Austria, France, Germany, and Ireland. While in France and Germany, compliance within the European Semester has been subject to strong politicization, {{this has not been}} the case in Austria and Ireland. Moreover, strong politicization coincided with the contestation of country-specific recommendations among the parliamentary parties. The empirical analysis established that strong formal powers <b>in</b> <b>budgetary</b> <b>matters</b> constitute an important prerequisite allowing parliamentary parties to articulate their contestation. However, the willingness to comply depends most directly on whether the content of country-specific recommendations is coherent with the economic preferences of a political party, not the government–opposition cleavage. Wird compliance im Rahmen des Europäischen Semesters durch nationale Parteien politisiert? Falls ja, entlang welcher Konfliktlinien orientieren sich parlamentarische Debatten? Um diese Fragen anzugehen, analysiert dieser Artikel die Beteiligung nationaler Parlamente in zwei Budgetzyklen des Europäischen Semesters (2014 und 2015) in Österreich, Deutschland, Frankreich und Irland. Während in Deutschland und Frankreich compliance im Rahmen des Europäischen Semesters verstärkt Gegenstand von Politisierung war, trifft dies in Irland und Österreich nicht zu. Darüber hinaus wurden in den Fällen mit starker Politisierung verstärkt auch Anfechtungen der länderspezifischen Empfehlungen durch die parlamentarischen Parteien festgestellt. Die empirische Analyse zeigt, dass starke formale Befugnisse in Budgetangelegenheiten eine wichtige Voraussetzung für Parlamente darstellen, länderspezifische Empfehlungen anzufechten. Allerdings hängt die Bereitschaft, den länderspezifischen Empfehlungen zu folgen, in großem Ausmaß davon ab, ob diese inhaltlich mit der zugrunde liegenden ökonomischen Haltung der Partei übereinstimmt und nicht von der Kluft zwischen Regierung und Opposition. 1 Introduction 2 What factors account for consent or contestation of EU policy guidance? 3 Research design 4 Empirical findings EU policy guidance in Ireland and Austria: Explaining domestic consent Explaining domestic contestation of EU policy guidance in Germany and France 5 Discussion Reference...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} Chinese local legislatures, the Local People’s Congresses (LPCs), and their {{accountability}} function within the one-party regime. The focus is to what extent, how, and why LPCs can promote political accountability {{in the face of}} the dominant Communist Party Committee as well as powerful government institutions in the reform era. Studies of accountability relationships usually are concerned with (1) vertical relations between voters and elected representatives and (2) horizontal relations between legislatures and governments. However, we should also distinguish between relationships in different policy areas; for instance, accountability <b>in</b> <b>budgetary</b> <b>matters</b> compared to other policy areas. This study views the accountability function of LPCs from a holistic perspective, based on an in-depth fieldwork of four LPCs in East and middle China. Starting with a “zero-based-monopoly model,” where LPCs exert minimal influence, this study finds that LPCs in recent years have strengthened all of the different aspects of accountability that were scrutinized. Compared to the previous monopoly model of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), controllability, transparency, and answerability have increased over time, although electoral accountability has been relatively limited due to its political sensitivity in the eyes of the CCP and governments. Significant progress has been made in other accountability aspects, however. The main strategies adopted by LPCs and congress deputies to increase influence have been to persuade the CCP to provide support, to strategically communicate with governments, to motivate the involvement of multiple forces such as the public, social organizations, and media, and to assert influential power instruments. At the same time, the analysis indicates great variation among the LPCs, something that might be attributed to factors such as distinctive power structures among the CCP, governments, and LPCs, personality traits of the elites, political promotion from social organizations and the public, and the subsequent institutional innovations at a micro level. One important finding of this study is that LPCs have succeeded in pioneering new mechanisms, such as the creation of a series of co-governance oriented institutional reforms in the budgetary arena, to enhance influence and to ensure accountability. Given the dominant technical attributes and implicit political attributes of the public budget, it seems a promising route to assert accountability, compared with the sensitive electoral issue under China’s current political circumstances. However, electoral accountability serves the function of potentially affecting the chain the accountability in other aspects; thus, the long-term performance of the LPC accountability still relies on the holistic development of multiple aspects. This is one crucially important accountability aspect that has been neglected in previous research. With that said, this study also finds that the CCP still plays a key role in defining and influencing accountability functions. Stronger LPCs do not necessarily weaken the legitimacy of the CCP—quite the contrary. Concessions may actually strengthen its legitimacy by providing a more flexible system. Indeed, the CCP has supported and inspired the changes in the accountability function of the LPCs. At the same time, the CCP does not shy away from imposing constraints when reforms are seen to challenge its dominance. To conclude, then, the obvious deviation from zero-base monopoly model that has happened in the Chinese local scene, where current authoritarian institutions have not dislodged CCP dominance. That is to say, the accountability function of LPCs is moving forward for real, but not at an overwhelming pace. In this sense, we can say that neither conservative nor fundamental changes are happening, but rather, the changes are necessary for responding to increasing governance problems as well as a way of enhancing the legitimacy of the established political system in conjunction within intensified public political consciousness...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One {{can view}} the period since 1970 {{as one in}} which the {{authorities}} struggled to establish appropriate medium-term anchors for both monetary and fiscal policies. During this time, they learned about the appropriate interaction between those two policies in the context of economic stabilization and growth under a flexible exchange rate regime. This lecture deals with four interrelated topics: the appropriate goals for fiscal and monetary policy, building policy credibility, the appropriate stabilization role for the two policies, and policy cooperation. The transparent mediumterm frameworks that have been established by the authorities will be extremely helpful in meeting the challenges that the future is sure to bring. These frameworks mean that the required adjustments in the economy will take place against a relatively stable background. Thank you for the invitation to give the Gow Lecture for 2002.
