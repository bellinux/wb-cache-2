5|$|A {{beaked whale}} is any {{of at least}} 22 species of small whale in the family Ziphiidae. They {{are one of the}} least-known {{families}} of large mammals: several species have only been described in the last two decades, and it is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> that more remain as yet undiscovered. Six genera have been identified.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Prime Minister Menzies {{recommended}} that Playford be bestowed with {{a form of}} honours. Playford's wish was to be made a privy councillor, yet, while <b>entirely</b> <b>possible,</b> if granted {{it would lead to}} demands from other state Premiers. Playford's grandfather had declined a KCMG, and Playford himself did initially, but under the influence of Menzies he eventually accepted the honour and was knighted in 1957, but this time a class above the KCMG; the GCMG.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the battle}} at Winterthur made {{possible}} the victory at Zürich. Once the Austrian armies united west, north and east of Zürich, Charles decided he had a sufficiently superior force to attack Masséna's positions in Zürich. His strategy, to develop a converging attack, was not <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> without another Austria corps, which was commanded by Suvorov, and positioned in the mountains in Italy; this would have {{made possible the}} near encirclement of Masséna's command at Zürich, making the French position untenable. Even so, at the First Battle of Zürich (4–7 June 1799), the Austrian army forced the French to abandon Zürich; Masséna withdrew across the Limmat, where {{he set up a}} defensive position on the low-lying hills overlooking the city and awaited his opportunity to reacquire the city.|$|E

30|$|The {{above-mentioned}} {{condition of}} “sufficient” convergence {{is at least}} partly fulfilled in many fields. Future analyses for demographic development for example show discrepancies and divergences in detail, but compared with the divergences in the energy sector they are markedly small. So mode 1 orientation will <b>entirely</b> be <b>possible</b> in particular fields.|$|R

50|$|Later star forts {{designed}} by military engineers like Vauban, comprised elaborate networks of ditches and parapets, carefully calculated {{so that the}} soil for the raised earthworks was provided, as nearly as <b>possible,</b> <b>entirely</b> by the excavations whilst also maximising defensive firepower.|$|R
50|$|The {{phenomenon}} is not <b>entirely</b> understood. One <b>possible</b> reason people see colors {{may be that}} the color receptors in the human eye respond at different rates to red, green, and blue. More specifically, the latencies of the center and the surrounding mechanisms differ for the different types of color-specific ganglion cells.|$|R
50|$|For {{cell-based}} {{approaches the}} utility of automated cell biology requires an examination of how automation and objective measurement can improve the experimentation and the understanding of disease. First, it removes {{the influence of the}} investigator in most, but not all, aspects of cell biology research and second it makes <b>entirely</b> new approaches <b>possible.</b>|$|R
25|$|It is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> {{that there}} are a number of {{components}} not listed below, either because of oversight, because they are rarely used, or because no simple Unicode representation for the component exists.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the Swedish {{government}} did not get news of Douglas' plan right away makes it <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> that the plan could have been implemented. However, when they did find out the plan was scrapped, although Douglas was allowed to retain command and later rose to become Chief of the Army.|$|E
25|$|Balaguer {{reciprocated}} Trujillo’s respect {{by spending}} the {{three decades of}} the Era {{as one of the}} most efficient public aides of the dictatorship, without seeming perturbed or showing the smallest gesture of disgust for the excesses and aberrations that were common at the time. Balaguer was, without doubt, a useful minister of Trujillo, although it is not <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> to speak of total loyalty.|$|E
50|$|Women may {{transmit}} HIV {{to their}} child via breastmilk. For this reason, breastfeeding is discouraged amongst HIV-positive women. In a study conducted in South Africa, 14.1% of children born to HIV-infected mothers were infected within 6 weeks of breastfeeding and 19.5% were infected by 6 months of age. A study in Malawi found {{that the risk of}} HIV transmission through breastfeeding was 7% in children who breastfed for one year and 10% in children who breastfed for two years. The risk of HIV infection appears to be highest in the early months of breastfeeding and HIV-infected mothers should avoid breastfeeding <b>entirely</b> if <b>possible.</b>|$|R

25|$|Whether a {{claimant}} {{can seek}} damages {{depends on whether}} the misrepresentation was innocent, negligent or fraudulent. The damages available will reflect losses, not a person's expectations, unless the misrepresentation was a promise incorporated as a term into the contract. Provided no double recovery results it is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> to rescind and claim damages (again, though, not expectation damages as if the contract were still in existence). There are four categories of damages claim, which are a combination of common law and the Misrepresentation Act 1967.|$|E
25|$|A {{radiation}} level of 10 sieverts per hour is read at a ventilation shaft between reactors 1 and 2. The area is subsequently sealed. The reading of 10 Sv is the maximum for many Geiger counters, including those used for these readings. One official {{states that it}} is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> that the radiation readings were higher since the counter was reading its maximum. Radiation has been impeding attempts to replace cooling systems. These are the highest readings logged indoors since the initial March 2011 explosions.|$|E
25|$|APCI {{generally}} suffers less ion suppression than ESI, {{as discussed}} previously. Where possible, if ion suppression is unavoidable {{it may be}} advisable to switch from ESI to APCI. If this is not possible, {{it may be useful}} to switch the ESI ionisation mode from positive to negative. Since less compounds are ionisable in negative ionisation mode, it is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> that the ion suppressing species may be removed from the analysis. However, it should also be considered that the analyte of interest may not be ionised effectively in negative mode either, rendering this approach useless.|$|E
40|$|A clear {{association}} {{has been described}} between numbers of pulmonary endocrine cells and the migration and/or proliferation of myofibroblasts which is thought to underlie the vascular changes seen in plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy due to cardiac shunts and primary pulmonary hypertension. In contrast, the pulmonary endocrine system in a subject with florid pulmonary plexogenic arteriopathy associated with cirrhosis was <b>entirely</b> normal, suggesting <b>possible</b> differences in its pathogenesis...|$|R
5000|$|Because of the [...] "growing {{evidence}} of a link between Zika and microcephaly", in January 2016, the CDC issued a travel alert advising pregnant women to consider postponing travel to countries and territories with ongoing local transmission of Zika virus. Later, the advice was updated to caution pregnant women to avoid these areas <b>entirely</b> if <b>possible</b> and, if travel is unavoidable, {{to protect themselves from}} mosquito bites. Male partners of pregnant women and couples contemplating pregnancy who must travel to areas where Zika is active are advised to use condoms or abstain from sex entirely. The agency also suggested that women thinking about becoming pregnant should consult with their physicians before traveling.|$|R

25|$|It is not {{required}} to move through every rank below to achieve a higher rank. For example, many officers promote directly to sergeant without ever being senior officers. Also, many assistant chiefs are promoted directly from the rank of lieutenant. Councilman C.O. Bradford was promoted to assistant chief from the rank of sergeant. Jack Heard was promoted to chief from the rank of sergeant. It is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> to become chief as an outsider such {{as in the case of}} Lee Brown, who went on to become mayor, and Harold Hurtt.|$|E
25|$|It is also <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> that homochirality {{is simply}} {{a result of the}} natural autoamplification process of life —that either the {{formation}} of life as preferring one chirality or the other was a chance rare event which happened to occur with the chiralities we observe, or that all chiralities of life emerged rapidly but due to catastrophic events and strong competition, the other unobserved chiral preferences were wiped out by the preponderance and metabolic, enantiomeric enrichment from the 'winning' chirality choices. The emergence of chirality consensus as a natural autoamplification process has been associated with the 2nd law of thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|While {{the bridge}} was blocked to vehicles, the {{remaining}} troops in Combat Command B crossed on foot. The {{east side of the}} bridge and the town of Erpel was secured overnight by nine Sherman tanks and the troops of Combat Command B. Although the Americans had crossed the bridge successfully, their toehold on the eastern bank was tenuous. The Germans still maintained control of the heights overlooking the bridge and the area around the slim bridgehead. If the Germans had been able to organize a coordinated, concentrated counterattack within the first 48 hours, it is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> they could have pushed the Americans back across the Rhine.|$|E
50|$|The {{common form}} {{is that in}} which one or other maxilla is affected, its size {{progressively}} increasing, and thus encroaching on the cavities of the orbit, the mouth, the nose and its accessory sinuses. Exophthalmos gradually develops, going on later to a complete loss of sight due to compression of the optic nerve by the overgrowth of bone. There may also be interference with the nasal respiration and with the taking of food. In the somewhat less common form of this rare disease the overgrowth of bone affects all the cranial bones {{as well as those}} of the face, the senses being lost one by one and death finally resulting from cerebral pressure. There is no treatment other than exposing the overgrown bone, and chipping away pieces, or excising <b>entirely</b> where <b>possible.</b>|$|R
40|$|It is {{proposed}} that nuclear (or electron) spins in a trapped molecule {{would be well}} isolated from {{the environment and the}} state of each spin can be measured by means of mechanical detection of magnetic resonance. Therefore molecular traps make an <b>entirely</b> new approach <b>possible</b> for spin-resonance quantum computation which can be conveniently scaled up. In the context of magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a molecular trap promises the ultimate sensitivity for single spin detection and an unprecedented spectral resolution as well...|$|R
60|$|Such a {{child will}} almost always be too much noticed; and it is {{scarcely}} <b>possible</b> <b>entirely</b> to guard against the evil: hence vanity, and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind. And true it is, that under better and even the best management, such constitutions are liable to selfishness; not showing itself {{in the shape of}} tyranny, caprice, avarice, meanness, envy, skulking, and base self-reference; but selfishness of a worthier kind, yet still rightly called by that name. What I mean I shall explain afterwards.|$|R
25|$|In a dual meet, {{when all}} team points are totaled, {{the team with}} the most points wins the competition. In all victory cases, if there are junior varsity matches, the junior varsity and varsity {{competitions}} are scored separately. If this is the case, it is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> for one participating institution to win the junior varsity dual meet and another participating institution to win the varsity dual meet. On the college level, it is possible for a dual meet to end in a tie, except in dual meet advancement tournaments, where then the tie is broken by one team point awarded to the winning team based on certain criteria.|$|E
25|$|When he {{was able}} to turn to the {{specifics}} of the case, Olinger reminded the justices that Hogan had agreed that, other than Doyle's contact with WSAI, the board had ample reason not to renew his contract. The rest of the argument focused on the jurisdictional issues. Olinger said that the difference between Doyle's salaries at Mt. Healthy and Miami Trace was too small to reach the $10,000 threshold. Pressed by one of the justices, he admitted that he was not taking into account the difference it might have made {{over the course of several}} years of employment; however he said it was <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> that Doyle's potential top salary step at his new school would be higher than it might be at Mt. Healthy.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1981, the {{two were}} fairly famous in the psi world, and even outside it, and Phillips decided to release a {{research}} brief at a workshop of the Parapsychological Association Convention (August 1981). According to the researchers' official version, Phillips also wrote to Randi {{to ask for a}} tape of fake metal-bending, which was to be shown alongside the recording of Shaw and Edwards. The researchers were looking for opinions and critical input from the parapsychology community and finally released a revised abstract that reflected the received criticism in its conservative and skeptical language. After the announcements in the press, Randi wrote to the lab again and stated that it was <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> {{the two were}} magicians, using common sleight of hand to fool the researchers.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, when N {{is much smaller}} than M (N = 1 or 2), {{removing}} quantization error <b>entirely</b> is not <b>possible.</b> Therefore, RBF system does not guarantee higher throughput than SUS-ee. SUS-ee with QBC or MESC has more codes for antenna combinations than RBF. For this reason, these two systems have additional opportunities to reduce quantization error compared to RBF. In consequence, employing a system which uses large codebook for antenna combinations undoubtedly provides the advantage of increasing the sum-rate of the system.|$|R
40|$|Discussion {{of various}} kinds of lunar {{features}} generally agreed to be of <b>entirely</b> volcanic origin. <b>Possible</b> mechanisms of formation of lunar domes, crater chains (especially those that lie along a rill), craters surrounded by dark halos, sinuous rills, mare ?wrinkle' ridges, dark smooth level material, and ring dike-like structures through volcanic activity are suggested.

30|$|The {{development}} {{in the quality of}} surgical endoscopes in gynaecology, the laparoscope and hysteroscope, has been nothing short of awesome. Not only is the visual quality improving to give us brilliantly clear detail, the size of the endoscopes is reducing dramatically, thus making hysteroscopy and less so laparoscopy entirely feasible under local anaesthetic. These factors coupled with the developing growth of camera and monitor technology, with the new single-chip cameras being almost as good as the triple-chip cameras, are leading to the level of clarity that allows advanced laparoscopic surgical dissection in anatomically challenging areas to be <b>entirely</b> feasible and <b>possible.</b>|$|R
