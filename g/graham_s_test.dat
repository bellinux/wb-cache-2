It {{was a surprise}} to find these three elements coming together in the one image. I hurried along the footpath to square up the picture. I was so intent on the car and the couple, I scarcely noticed the beer sign until I developed the film. This was about the same era as the introduction of the meter maids. Bikinis were becoming smaller and created so much debate in the press. This was good publicity for the Gold Coast. Even in this image, you can see evidence of the bikini decreasing in size.

500|$|In 1987, the British ornithologist <b>Graham</b> <b>S.</b> Cowles {{prepared}} a manuscript that described {{a new species}} of Old World babbler, Rodriguites microcarina, based on an incomplete sternum found in a cave on Rodrigues. [...] In 1989, the name was mistakenly published before the description, making it a nomen nudum. Later examination of the sternum by Hume showed that Rodriguites microcarina was identical to the Rodrigues starling.|$|R
50|$|S. perplexum {{was first}} {{collected}} by <b>Graham</b> <b>S.</b> McCutcheon in 1983, but was initially identified as S. fasciculatum.

The only known location {{of this species}} is on the Whicher Scarp, near Dardanup. It grows in lateritic soils among Eucalyptus marginata and Corymbia haematoxylon woodlands. It flowers in November and December.|$|R

40|$|The {{hydrogen}} sulphide (H 2 <b>S,)</b> <b>test</b> {{has been proposed}} as a presence-absence, low-cost field test to detect microbial contamination for nearly 30 years and is now widely used in many counfries. The objective {{of this study is}} to identify different sfrategies for deploying the test and assess how each might be affected by the test's accuracy. Evidence on the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test's</b> accuracy is drawn from a recent systematic review. We ident/Ied six different sfrategies for deploying the test based on a literature review. Three sfrategies used the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> in isolation, while the other three used the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> in combination with standard, laboratory-based methods or alongside sanitary risk inspection surveys. We conclude that using the test in combination with laboratory-based methods or sanitary risk inspections reduces the problems posed by false positive H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> results. However, such sfrategies may be more costly and complex to implement...|$|R
5|$|The taxonomic affinities of the broad-billed parrot are un{{determine}}d. Considering {{its large}} jaws and other osteological features, the ornithologists Edward Newton and Hans Gadow thought {{it to be}} {{closely related to the}} Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodricanus) in 1893, but were unable to determine whether they both belonged in the same genus, since a crest was only known from the latter. The British ornithologist <b>Graham</b> <b>S.</b> Cowles instead found their skulls too dissimilar for them to be close relatives in 1987.|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} {{accuracy of the}} H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> for microbiological contamination of domestic water across different settings, {{as a basis for}} providing guidance on its use. Methods We searched a range of bibliographic and ‘grey’ literature databases to identify studies that had processed domestic water samples using both the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> and recognized tests for thermotolerant coliforms or Escherichia coli. We screened 661 study abstracts and identified 51 relevant studies based on 13 853 water samples. For each relevant study, we recorded the level of correspondence between the H 2 <b>S</b> and recognized <b>tests,</b> microbial testing procedures, details of the samples processed and study quality indicators. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the impact of testing procedures, study quality and sample characteristics on the diagnostic accuracy of the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test.</b> Results H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> implementation varied between studies, and the test’s diagnostic accuracy varied significantly and substantially between studies. Little of this variation was explained by testing procedures, study quality or the nature of the samples processed. Conclusions Although in widespread use, our findings suggest that the diagnostic accuracy, particularly specificity, of the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> is variable. Optimal conditions for conducting the test remain unclear. As H 2 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> accuracy is low in a minority of these studies, we recommend that its performance be evaluated relative to standard methods, prior to its operational deployment in a new setting...|$|R

30|$|Maintaining the {{preferential}} inversions, the DS measure {{cannot be}} further {{considered as a}} distance between the reference image and the distorted one {{with respect to the}} analyzed artifact (zipper artifact), as we have previously discussed. The influence of these inversions appears to be different in the case of 1 S and 2 <b>S</b> <b>tests.</b> In fact, the effect of the introduced sharpness is lower {{in the case of the}} 1 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> because there is not a simultaneous comparison with the original image. Thus, the analysis of the 1 <b>S</b> <b>test</b> results with respect to the 2 S ones can be useful for evaluating this phenomenon.|$|R
