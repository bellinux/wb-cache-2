40|$|The {{eriophyid}} mite Calepitrimerus vitis is {{a common}} pest in many vineyards in Hungary. <b>Deutogynes</b> (winter-form) of Calepitrimerus vitis in the vineyards of Szekszárd emerge from their overwintering sites in spring. Protogynes (summer-form) start to appear {{at the beginning of}} May, replacing <b>deutogynes</b> gradually. The process lasts until the end of May when the <b>deutogynes</b> disappear. The mite population increases slightly during the summer months. In August a rapid increase occurs. The maximum density of mites is reached at the middle of August or at the beginning of September, when the first <b>deutogynes</b> appear. The mite density declines in September rapidly and it is very low in October. The hibernation shelters are in the buds and at the cane base with the 2 year old wood. The most females are found at the cane base and in buds 1 – 4. In upper buds mite density gradually declines. A washing technique is described to estimate the population of Calepitrimerus vitis and useful for sampling of eriophyid mites either in summer or winter...|$|R

40|$|Five {{species of}} eriophyoid mites were {{identified}} during surveys of mite fauna associated with plant {{species of the}} family Compositae from Southwest of East Azerbaijan province during 2010 and 2011. Two of them, Aceria virgatae n. sp. from Centaurea virgata Lam. and Aceria xeranthemis n. sp. from Xeranthemum squarrosum Boiss., {{were found to be}} new to science. No damage symptoms were observed on their host plants. Aceria xeranthemis n. sp. is the first eriophyoid collected from the plant genus Xeranthemum. Aculops centaureae (Farkas, 1960) from Centaurea albonitens Turrill and Aceria cichorii Petanovic et al. 2000 from Cichorium intybus L. are new records for Iranian mite fauna. The <b>deutogyne</b> female of Aceria anthocoptes (Nalepa) was recorded {{for the first time in}} Iran, too. A key to the species collected on Compositae in Iran is given...|$|E
40|$|The first winter-forms (<b>deutogyne)</b> of the {{eriophyid}} mite Calepitrimerus vitis {{appear in}} the vineyards of Szekszárd {{at the beginning of}} August and then the mites continuously take refuge in their hibernation shelters until end of October. Most winter-forms move to the buds during September. There is no connection between the moving period length and the yearly infection. In spite of the low mite population in the years with weak infestation (1999, 2001) the movement lasts the same late, until end of October. Ratio of the mites taking refuge in hibernation shelters is the best {{at the beginning of the}} moving period in August and it is decreasing continuously until October. Considering the directions of movement to the hibernation shelters, 74. 7 % of the mites seek for the hibernation shelters moved down and 25. 3 % of the mites moved up. A new method is described, useful for practical purposes in an effort to evaluate the number of mites moving towards their hibernation shelters...|$|E
