30|$|Torques on {{the gearbox}} are found from the {{variation}} of the polished rod load during the pumping cycle; torque calculations, therefore, depend on the accurate measurement of those loads. These are obtained from a dynamometer survey {{which is the most}} valuable tool for analyzing the performance of the pumping system. Polished rod dynamometers, as the name implies, are instruments recording polished rod loads during the pumping cycle. The conventional dynamometer produces a continuous plot of polished rod load versus polished rod displacement, the so-called dynamometer diagram or card. Modern dynamometers, on the other hand, are electronic devices that record the loads and displacements at the polished rod in the function of time. Because of the operating differences of the two <b>dynamometer</b> <b>types</b> different procedures must be used to derive gearbox torques depending on the device used, as discussed in the following.|$|R
50|$|A {{multiple}} jet or multijet meter is a velocity <b>type</b> <b>meter</b> {{which has an}} impeller which rotates horizontally on a vertical shaft. The impeller element is in a housing in which multiple inlet ports direct the fluid flow at the impeller causing it to rotate in a specific direction {{in proportion to the}} flow velocity. This meter works mechanically much like a single jet meter except that the ports direct the flow at the impeller equally from several points around the circumference of the element, not just one point; this minimizes uneven wear on the impeller and its shaft. Thus these <b>types</b> of <b>meters</b> are recommended to be installed horizontally with its roller index pointing skywards.|$|R

40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} shown that weaker grip {{strength}} in later life is associated with disability, morbidity, and mortality. Grip strength is a key component of the sarcopenia and frailty phenotypes and yet it is unclear how individual measurements should be interpreted. Our objective was to produce cross-sectional centile values for grip strength across the life course. A secondary objective was to examine the impact of different aspects of measurement protocol. We combined 60, 803 observations from 49, 964 participants (26, 687 female) of 12 general population studies in Great Britain. We produced centile curves for ages 4 to 90 and investigated the prevalence of weak grip, defined as strength at least 2. 5 SDs below the gender-specific peak mean. We carried out a series of sensitivity analyses {{to assess the impact of}} <b>dynamometer</b> <b>type</b> and measurement position (seated or standing). Our results suggested three overall periods: an increase to peak in early adult life, maintenance through to midlife, and decline from midlife onwards. Males were on average stronger than females from adolescence onwards: males' peak median grip was 51 kg between ages 29 and 39, compared to 31 kg in females between ages 26 and 42. Weak grip strength, defined as strength at least 2. 5 SDs below the gender-specific peak mean, increased sharply with age, reaching a prevalence of 23 % in males and 27 % in females by age 80. Sensitivity analyses suggested our findings were robust to differences in <b>dynamometer</b> <b>type</b> and measurement position. This is the first study to provide normative data for grip strength across the life course. These centile values have the potential to inform the clinical assessment of grip strength which is recognised as an important part of the identification of people with sarcopenia and frailty.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} by {{measuring}} the cutting forces {{the effect of the}} tool shape and qualifications (sharp and worn cutting tools of both vee and knife edge profile) and cutting conditions (depth of cut and cutting speed) in the turning operation on the tool deflection and cutting force is investigated. The workpiece material was mild steel and the cutting tool was made of high speed steel. Cutting forces were measured by a <b>dynamometer</b> (<b>type</b> P. E. I. serial No 154). The dynamometer essentially consisted of a cantilever structure which held the cutting tool. Deflection of the cantilever was measured by an L. V. D. T (Mercer 122) deflection indicator. No cutting fluid was used during the turning operations. A modern CNC lathe machine (Okuma LH 35 -N) was used for the tests. It was noted that worn vee profile tools tended to produce a greater increase in the vertical force component than the axial component, whereas knife tools tended to show a more pronounced increase in the axial component.
