5|$|The {{practical}} construction {{given by}} the state of New York to the federal constitution, as shown by the numerous treaties made by it with the <b>Indian</b> <b>tribes,</b> and the recognition by the federal authority of their validity, is very strong evidence that the clause in the federal constitution prohibiting the states from entering into treaties does not preclude a state, having the preemption right to Indian lands, from dealing with the <b>Indian</b> <b>tribes</b> directly, for the extinguishment of the Indian title.|$|E
5|$|But the dealing by {{the general}} {{government}} with the <b>Indian</b> <b>tribes</b> through treaties was resorted to as a convenient mode of regulating Indian affairs, and not because, as with other nations, {{it was the only}} mode, independently of the arbitrament of war, of dealing with them.|$|E
5|$|African {{slaves were}} {{originally}} excluded from United States citizenship. In 1857, the United States Supreme Court held in Dred Scott v.

Additionally, American Indians were not originally recognized as citizens, since <b>Indian</b> <b>tribes</b> {{were considered to be}} outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. government.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of this country's history, most American <b>Indian</b> <b>tribes</b> have been subject to federal authority and jurisdiction. In Maine, however, indigenous populations lived on reservations that were exclusively and completely administered by the state. This unique arrangement shaped tribal life in Maine, and proved to be a crucial issue in the development and resolution of the tribe's land claim.|$|E
5|$|A {{decision}} {{holding that}} this action could be maintained {{either by the}} tribe, or an individual member thereof on behalf of himself and all others who should come in and contribute, would be contrary to the policy and practice which have been long established in our treatment of the <b>Indian</b> <b>tribes.</b> They are regarded as the wards of the state, and, generally speaking, possessed of only such rights to appear and litigate in courts of justice as are conferred upon them by statute.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{preliminary}} peace in 1712, the Treaty of Utrecht ended {{the war in}} 1713. It resulted in the French ceding to Britain the territories of Hudson Bay, Acadia, and Newfoundland, while retaining Cape Breton and other islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Some of its terms were ambiguous, and concerns of various <b>Indian</b> <b>tribes</b> {{were not included in}} the treaty, setting the stage for future conflicts.|$|E

5|$|Joint a Tribal Council, of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton, 528 F.2d 370 (1st Cir. 1975), was a {{landmark}} decision regarding aboriginal {{title in the}} United States. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that the Nonintercourse Act applied to the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot, non-federally-recognized <b>Indian</b> <b>tribes,</b> and established a trust relationship between those tribes {{and the federal government}} that the state of Maine could not terminate.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{held that}} <b>Indian</b> <b>tribes</b> {{have a common}} law cause of action for possessory land claims based upon {{aboriginal}} title, that the Nonintercourse Act did not preempt that cause of action, and {{that the cause of}} action was not barred by a statute of limitations, abatement, implicit federal ratification, or nonjusticiability. Four dissenting justices would have held for the counties on the defense of laches, a question which the majority did not reach, but expressed doubts about.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of the}} 18th century, the Oklahoma {{region was}} under nominal French control as Louisiana. The limited {{interaction}} between the peoples was based on fur trading. In 1803, the Louisiana Purchase by Thomas Jefferson brought the area under United States control. In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which removed American <b>Indian</b> <b>tribes</b> from the Southeast and relocated them to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. The southern part of this territory was originally assigned to the Choctaw and Chickasaw. In 1867, the United States used the Medicine Lodge Treaty to allot the southwest portion of the Choctaw and Chickasaw’s lands to the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache tribes.|$|E
5|$|Queen Anne's War (1702–1713), as the North American {{theater of}} the War of the Spanish Succession was known in the British colonies, was the second {{in a series of}} French and Indian Wars fought between France and England, later Great Britain, in North America for control of the continent. The War of the Spanish Succession was {{primarily}} fought in Europe. In addition to the two main combatants, the war also involved numerous American <b>Indian</b> <b>tribes</b> allied with each nation, and Spain, which was allied with France. It was also known as the Third Indian War or in French as the Second Intercolonial War.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the ruling {{in this case was}} that it tested the constitutionality of the Act and confirmed Congress' authority over Indian affairs. Plenary power over <b>Indian</b> <b>tribes,</b> supposedly granted to the U.S. Congress by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, was not deemed necessary to support the Supreme Court in this decision; instead, the Court found the power in the tribes' status as dependent domestic nations. This allowed Congress to pass the Dawes Act the following year. The case has been criticized by legal scholars as drawing on powers that are not granted to Congress by the Constitution. It remains , despite that criticism.|$|E
