5|$|The kōata, {{the growing}} {{tip of the}} plant, was eaten raw as medicine. When cooked, {{it was called the}} kōuka. If the spike of unopened leaves and a few outer leaves is gripped firmly at the base and bent, it will snap off. The leaves can be removed, and what remains is like a small {{artichoke}} heart that can be steamed, roasted or boiled to make kōuka, a bitter vegetable available at any time of the year. Kōuka <b>is</b> <b>delicious</b> as a relish with fatty foods like eel, muttonbirds, or pigeons, or in modern times, pork, mutton and beef. Different trees were selected for their degree of bitterness, which should be strong for medicinal use, but less so when used as a vegetable.|$|E
25|$|Boq'ullit (boiled salted {{broad beans}} embryo) {{is one of}} the most {{favorite}} snacks in the evening, the common story-telling time in north and central Ethiopia.

It is first used in Chamber of Secrets to allow Harry and Ron to transform into Crabbe and Goyle {{so that they can}} question Draco Malfoy about the Heir of Slytherin. The potion is one of the complicated ones, as it needs a month to be cooked.|$|E

500|$|The mystery writer J.A. Jance {{wrote in}} the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Yes, it's {{a bit of a}} shock to {{discover}} that some of the TV series' characters who died last season or the season before are back among the living between the covers of Lindsay's new book. Rita, Dexter's long-suffering wife who died a terrible death in a bathtub in last year's season finale, is alive and well and having a baby in Dexter <b>Is</b> <b>Delicious.</b> But my advice to readers is this: Don't quibble. Get over it. After all, fiction is an alternate universe to begin with, and Lindsay's dark, comedic fiction is an alternate universe once removed. Patrick McCann and Colin Wrinn were very upset about her death in Season 4 of the hit TV show, Dexter, but Colin Whelan did not care for her." ...|$|E
500|$|In Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the two {{are already}} together, but it is {{explained}} that Dexter started dating her solely to improve his [...] "disguise" [...] as a normal person. Because she was brutalized by her now-jailed ex-husband, Rita fears intimacy and does not expect much of Dexter; this suits the asexual Dexter perfectly. By the novel's climax, Dexter admits that he is fond of her children, Astor and Cody, the closest he can get to feeling love. By a humorous misunderstanding, the couple become engaged in Dearly Devoted Dexter and married {{at the end of}} Dexter in the Dark. In the books, Rita is scatter-brained and easily upset, prone to speaking in disjointed, rambling sentences that Dexter often finds incomprehensible. The only quality that Dexter truly appreciates about her is that she is an excellent cook. She is a physical fitness buff; she and Dexter regularly go for [...] runs, long bike rides, and weightlifting sessions together. In the fifth book, Dexter <b>is</b> <b>Delicious,</b> she gives birth to Dexter's daughter Lily Anne. In Dearly Devoted Dexter, Dexter discovers that Cody and Astor are budding sociopaths and decides to provide them with the same [...] "guidance" [...] that his adoptive father Harry gave to him; namely, to teach them how to be careful, efficient killers of those who [...] "deserve it". Rita is kept in the dark about the true nature of their relationship. She suspects that something is wrong with the children when she discovers them torturing a cat, but Dexter is able to reassure her that they didn't understand what they were doing. The television series is based on Darkly Dreaming Dexter. In Dexter's Final Cut, Dexter has an affair with TV star Jackie Forrest, and briefly considers leaving Rita. At the end of the novel, however, both Rita and Jackie are murdered by Robert Chase, a pedophile intent on kidnapping Astor.|$|E
500|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "The characters are irresistible, the animation is astonishing and the film, a fantasy {{version of a}} foodie rhapsody, sustains a level of joyous invention that hasn't been seen in family entertainment since The Incredibles." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film {{four and a half}} stars out of five, saying [...] "Brad Bird's Ratatouille is so audacious you have {{to fall in love with}} its unlikely hero." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Ratatouille <b>is</b> <b>delicious</b> fun sure to be savored by audiences of all ages for its sumptuous visuals, clever wit and irresistibly inspiring tale." [...] Miriam Di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Ratatouille will make you wonder why animation needs to hide behind the mantle of 'it's for children, but grownups will like it, too.' This one's for Mom and Dad, and yep, the kids will like it, too." [...] Michael Booth of The Denver Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Writer and director Brad Bird keeps Ratatouille moving without resorting to the cute animal jokes or pop-culture wisecracking that ruined so many other recent animated films." [...] Tom Long of The Detroit News gave the film an A, saying [...] "Ratatouille has the technical genius, emotional core and storytelling audacity to lift it into the ranks of [...] Pixar films, the crème de la crème of modern animation." [...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "No sketchy backgrounds here – Ratatouilles scenes feels like deep-focus camera shots. The textures, from the gleam of copper pans to the cobblestone streets, are almost palpable." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Ratatouille doesn't center on the over-familiar surfaces of contemporary life. It harks back to Disney's older era, when cartoons seemed part of a more elegant world with less edgy characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2001 {{interview}} with The Guardian, Morricone {{stated that he}} had good experiences with De Palma: [...] "De Palma <b>is</b> <b>delicious!</b> He respects music, he respects composers. For The Untouchables, everything I proposed to him was fine, but then he wanted a piece that I didn't like at all, {{and of course we}} didn't have an agreement on that. It was something I didn't want to write – a triumphal piece for the police. I think I wrote nine different pieces for this in total and I said, 'Please don't choose the seventh!' because it was the worst. And guess what he chose? The seventh one. But it really suits the movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Megan Lehmann, {{writing in}} The Hollywood Reporter, {{said that the}} film [...] "defies {{all but the most}} cynical not to get carried away by the force of its grandiose imagery and storytelling", and it is [...] "much less earnest than the trailer suggests, layered with a thin veneer of camp and a nod and a wink to {{accompany}} the requisite Aussie clichés", {{and the bottom line is}} [...] "In epic style, Baz Luhrmann weaves his wizardry on Oz". Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, noting [...] "Baz Luhrmann dreamed of making the Australian Gone with the Wind, and so he has, with much of that film's lush epic beauty and some of the same awkwardness with a national legacy of racism". David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, [...] "Kidman seems to blossom under Luhrmann's direction: she's funny, warm and charming, and the erotic charge between her and the gruff, hunky Jackman <b>is</b> <b>delicious.</b> In a solemn season, Australias bold, kitschy, unapologetic artifice is a welcome respite". In her review for the New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, [...] "this creation story about modern Australia is a testament to movie love at its most devout, cinematic spectacle at its most extreme, and kitsch as an act of aesthetic communion". Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote, [...] "Australia is clearly a labor of love, and a matter of national pride. It is also a bit of a mess. I must confess that I might have been harder on Mr Luhrmann's film if I had not remained entranced by Ms Kidman ever since I first saw her in Phillip Noyce's Dead Calm in 1989; in my opinion, she has lost none of her luster in the 20 years since". In his review for Time, Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "Have you seen everything Australia has on offer a dozen times before? Sure you have. It's a movie less created by director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann than assembled, Dr Frankenstein-style, from the leftover body parts of earlier movies. Which leaves us asking this question: How come it is so damnably entertaining?" [...] Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal, opines that, [...] "in its heart of hearts Australia is an old-fashioned Western - a Northern, if you will - and all the more enjoyable for it." [...] Nick Rogers, of FilmYap, adds that, [...] "Luhrmann mythologized his homeland as American directors like John Ford did with Westerns — dramatic-license exaggerations that pay off in droves." [...] Ann Hornaday, in her review for the Washington Post, wrote, [...] "A wildly ambitious, luridly indulgent spectacle of romance, action, melodrama and revisionism, Australia is windy, overblown, utterly preposterous and insanely entertaining". In her review for Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek wrote, [...] "The second half of Australia, Luhrmann's attempt to pull off a wartime weeper, is so aggressively sentimental that it begins to feel more like punishment than pleasure. I left Australia feeling drained and weakened, as if I'd suffered a gradual poisoning at the hands of a mad scientist".|$|E
