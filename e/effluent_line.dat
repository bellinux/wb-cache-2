RM 38 is isolated from upstream fish migration by two dams located near Hamilton, Ohio and fish collected from this site should not be influenced by processes at the downstream sites. Samples of 549 fish from 29 species belonging to nine families provided seventy-two samples for uranium analysis by an independent laboratory.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this three-phase project were to design, develop, and demonstrate a monitoring system capable of detecting and quantifying tritium in situ in ground and surface waters, and in water from <b>effluent</b> <b>lines</b> prior to discharge into public waterways. The tritium detection system design {{is based on}} measurement of the low energy beta radiation from the radioactive decay of tritium using a special form of scintillating optical fiber directly {{in contact with the}} water to be measured. The system consists of the immersible sensor module containing the optical fiber, and an electronics package, connected by an umbilical cable. The system can be permanently installed for routine water monitoring in wells or process or <b>effluent</b> <b>lines,</b> or can be moved from one location to another for survey use. The electronics will read out tritium activity directly in units of pico Curies per liter, with straightforward calibration. In Phase 1 of the project, we characterized the sensitivity of fluor-doped plastic optical fiber to tritium beta radiation. In addition, we characterized the performance of photomultiplier tubes needed for the system. In parallel with this work, we defined the functional requirements, target specifications, and system configuration for an in situ tritium beta detector that would use the fluor-doped fibers as primary sensors of tritium concentration in water. The major conclusions from the characterization work are: A polystyrene optical fiber with fluor dopant concentration of 2 % gave best performance. This fiber had the highest dopant concentration of any fibers tested. Stability may be a problem. The fibers exposed to a 22 -day soak in 120 F water experienced a 10 x reduction in sensitivity. It is not known whether this was due to the build up of a deposit (a potentially reversible effect) or an irreversible process such as leaching of the scintillating dye. Based on the results achieved, it is premature to initiate Phase 2 and commit to a prototype design for construction and test. Significant improvements must be made in fluor-doped fiber performance in order to use the method for in situ monitoring to verify compliance with current EPA drinking water standards. Additional Phase 1 fiber development work should be performed to increase the fluor dopant concentration above 2 % until the self-absorption limit is observed. Continued fiber optimization work is expected to improve the sensitivity limits, and will enable application of the detector to verify compliance with the US EPA drinking water standard of 20, 000 pico Curies per liter. However, if the need for monitoring higher levels of tritium in water at concentrations greater than 200, 000 pico Curies per liter is justified, then prototype development and testing could proceed either as a Phase 2 stand-alone effort or in parallel with continued Phase 1 development work...|$|R
40|$|The US Department of Energy (DOE) is {{initiating}} {{tests of}} reactor fuel {{for use in}} an Advanced Gas Reactor (AGR). The AGR will use helium coolant, a low-power-density ceramic core, and coated-particle fuel. A series of eight (8) fuel irradiation tests are planned for the Idaho National Laboratory’s (INL’s) Advanced Test Reactor (ATR). One important measure of fuel performance in these tests is quantification of the fission gas releases over the nominal 2 -year duration of each irradiation experiment. This test objective will be met using the AGR Fission Product Monitoring System (FPMS) which includes seven (7) on-line detection stations viewing {{each of the six}} test capsule <b>effluent</b> <b>lines</b> (plus one spare). Each station incorporates both a heavily-shielded high-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray spectrometer for quantification of the isotopic releases, and a NaI(Tl) scintillation detector to monitor the total count rate and identify the timing of the releases. The AGR- 1 experiment will begin irradiation after October 1, 2006. To support this experiment, the FPMS has been completely assembled, tested, and calibrated in a laboratory at the INL, and then reassembled and tested in its final location in the ATR reactor basement.

A total of 0. 0994 cu m (26. 25 gallons) of domestic wash water was processed over a 7 -day period at an average process rate of 0. 0146 cu m per day (3. 85 gallons per day). The subsystem produced water that met all United States Public Health Standards for drinking water {{with the exception of}} two standards which could not be analyzed at the required sensitivity levels. Average energy consumption for this evaluation to maintain both the recovery process and microbial control in the recovered water was approximately 3366 kilowatt-hours per cubic meter (12. 74 kilowatt-hours per gallon) of water recovered. This condition represents a worst case energy consumption since no attempt was made to recover heat energy in the subsystem.

In this study we attempt {{to resolve this issue}} by repeatedly sampling two beaches using a stratified random design. Three sampling sessions took place, each approximately six months apart. The three sites on the first beach were selected according to the type of beach (reflective, intermediate and dissipative) with each morphological type duplicated on the second beach. Many of the physical variables measured had significant differences between the sampling sessions but only a few were significantly different between the Sites. Very few of the individual physical variables had significant relationships with the sandy beach macrofaunal abundance and density. However, composite indices had a greater number of significant relationships with the macrofaunal abundance and density. Also very few significant relationships were seen between the species richness and the physical variables of the beaches studied. <b>Effluent</b> <b>line</b> crossing frequency was the only physical variable that could predict species richness but it was considered a weak predictor. Changes in the zonation patterns within and between beaches were also investigated.

Some of the sandy beach community variables (abundance, density and species richness) showed significant difference between the sampling sessions but no significant differences were seen between the two beaches.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the potential propagation of bacteriophage in biofilms of cheese starter cultures. It was hypothesized that the biofilms of the starter cultures may form in cheese and casein plants, perhaps in whey drain lines and become a reservoir and site of propagation of phage particles. Phage can infect and destroy the bulk starter cultures used for cheese production and this might cause a severe economic loss in the cheese manufacturing industry. Bacteriophage attacks against thermophilic dairy starter bacteria are now recognized as the main cause of slow or faulty fermentative production in dairy plants. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether the starter cultures are capable of producing biofilms and to investigate the ability of phage to propagate inside them. The project was started by examination of attachment and biofilm formation by S. thermophilus, a common starter bacterium used for the manufacture of cheese. The initial experiments showed that these starter cultures have the capacity to attach and produce biofilms on stainless steel coupons at a temperature of 30 ºC, which showed that they were capable of attaching to the whey <b>effluent</b> <b>lines</b> in a cheese factory and thereby become potential sites for phage propagation. An experiment was conducted by infecting an existing biofilm with phage. The results showed that phage have the capacity to penetrate an existing biofilm matrix and produce an infection, causing the number of cells to decrease sharply. The results of this study has confirmed the fact that phage not only attack planktonic cultures, but have the ability to propagate in biofilms. The experiment was repeated, observing the fate of the cells in the biofilm over a prolonged duration. It was observed that the number of cells in the biofilm decreased with concomitant increase of phage numbers. However, over the period of observation, there remained viable cells in the biofilm. Therefore it is evident from this study that phage particles replicate within a biofilm, and thus biofilms are a potential reservoir of infection in cheese and casein plants. It is suggested that the incidence of phage in the cheese industry can be reduced by preventing the growth of biofilms in whey and casein transfer pipes...|$|R

The highest abundances of E. analoga occurred during March and December 1997. During November 1996, March and December 1997, the highest abundances occurred below the <b>effluent</b> <b>line,</b> while in July 1996 and August 1997, most of the stages of E. analoga occurred in higher abundances above the <b>effluent</b> <b>line.</b> Ovigerous females were recorded over the entire study period. Juveniles were also present during all sampling months, peaking during March 1997. Body size of ovigerous females varied between 12. 6 and 26. 4 mm. Fecundity increased significantly with body size of females in all samples analyzed. The analyses of recruitment pattern for males and females suggest the existence of two pulses in the recruitment of E. analoga at Hornitos: one between October and December, and another one between February and March. Growth analyses show that females have growth rates a maximum body sizes higher than males. Comparisons with similar studies carried out at the coast of south central Chile (ca. 39 degreesS), a region where upwelling occurs occasionally, show that E. analoga from this region have similar growth rates but attain a greater maximum body size than in Hornitos. It is concluded that proximity to areas of persistent upwelling seems not to affect life history of E. analoga in northern Chile.

40|$|The {{macrofauna}} {{of seven}} beaches {{along the coast}} of Ecuador, in the tropical part of the Eastern Pacific, was sampled along transects. The beaches covered the entire range of beach types that occur {{in this part of the}} continent. The aim of the study was to identify the relation between morphodynamic state of beaches and several biological characteristics of the macrofauna: biodiversity, density, abundance, biomass, zonation and trophic structure. The Ecuadorian beaches were characterized by a very diverse macrofaunal community; a total of 47 species were identified. This confirms the recent idea of a larger species pool existing in the tropics than in temperate regions. There was a very clear drop in species count when moving from the flat, dissipative beaches to the steep, reflective beaches. This was partly due to the absence of molluscs from the reflective beaches. Biomass and abundance (ind/m) likewise decreased towards reflective beach states, but not density (ind/m 2), because reflective beaches harboured dense populations of interstitial polychaetes. Changes in biodiversity and, to a lesser extent, biomass could be linked to four environmental factors: sediment grain size, beach slope, number of <b>effluent</b> <b>line</b> crossings and swash width. The zonation patterns confirmed the current state of knowledge on the topic, with four distinct zones on dissipative and intermediate beaches and only three zones on reflective beaches. This seems to be caused by the relatively wide swash zone compared to the intertidal width, combined with the absence of a surf zone on reflective beaches. The major distinction between the two groups of beaches was based on the presence of a rich middle and lower beach species association on the dissipative / intermediate beaches and the abundant interstitial community on the reflective beaches; the upper beach association was very similar on all beaches. Six different feeding types were distinguished. Trophic diversity was markedly higher in the dissipative situation. Filter feeders were dominant on all beaches, followed by scavengers and carnivores. Deposit feeders peaked on the dissipative beaches; the reflective beaches were characterized by a high density of interstitial dwellers. In conclusion, the dissipative and intermediate beaches were very similar in species composition, density, abundance and trophic structure. The reflective beaches were clearly different in all these aspects. It seems that there is a gradual change from dissipative to intermediate beaches yet an abrupt change from intermediate to reflective beaches...|$|E

40|$|Methodology {{has been}} {{developed}} {{for the use of}} fish cell lines as alternatives to the use of whole fish in the toxicity testing of industrial effluents. Relative to conventional fish tests, this should reduce the number of fish consumed in testing and save money by cutting the volume of effluent that must be shipped from distant sources to central testing facilities. The effectiveness of this methodology was illustrated recently by screening effluent samples from a paper mill. Potentially, the same approach could be applied to the mining sector. As a result, the toxicity of various metals [Cu, Zn, Cd, Fe and Ni] to fish cell lines was studied to determine the effectiveness of these cells as a screening tool for mining <b>effluent.</b> The cell <b>lines</b> were RTL-W 1 from the liver and RTgill-W 1 from the gill of rainbow trout. Cellular viability was measured using three fluorometric assays. These were alamar Blue (AB) for metabolic activity, CFDA-AM for membrane integrity and neutral red (NR) for lysosomal activity. The toxicity of the metals was affected by exposure medium. Little or no toxicity occurred when the cells were exposed to metals in the basal medium, L- 15, or in L- 15 with fetal bovine serum (FBS). However, toxicity was observed for all metals except Ni when exposures were done in the minimal medium L- 15 /ex, which contains only physiological salts, galactose and sodium pyruvate. In L- 15 /ex, the rank order of toxicity from least to most toxic was Ni <Fe < Cd < Zn < Cu. Research was also begun on using the free-living protozoan, Tetrahymena thermophila as another potential test cell to screen for metal toxicity.
