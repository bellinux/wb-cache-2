5|$|The gods {{involved}} in a festival also received various offerings in much larger quantities than in daily ceremonies. The <b>enormous</b> <b>amounts</b> of food listed in festival texts are unlikely to have been divided among the priests alone, so {{it is likely that}} the celebrating commoners also participated in the reversion of these offerings.|$|E
5|$|The slime glands {{along the}} body of the hagfish secrete <b>enormous</b> <b>amounts</b> of mucus when it is {{provoked}} or stressed. The gelatinous slime has dramatic effects on the flow and viscosity of water, rapidly clogging the gills of any fish that attempt to capture hagfish; predators typically release the hagfish within seconds (pictured above). Common predators of hagfish include seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans, but few fish, suggesting that predatory fish avoid hagfish as prey.|$|E
5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply <b>enormous</b> <b>amounts</b> {{of information about}} the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E

5|$|Strategic Air Command {{found itself}} in an uncomfortable position; bombers had been tuned for {{efficiency}} at high speeds and altitudes, performance that had been purchased at great cost in both engineering and financial terms. Before the B-70 was to replace the B-52 in the long-range role, SAC had introduced the B-58 Hustler to replace the Boeing B-47 Stratojet in the medium-range role. The Hustler was expensive to develop and purchase, and required <b>enormous</b> <b>amounts</b> of fuel and maintenance {{in comparison to the}} B-47. It was estimated that it cost three times as much to operate as the much larger and longer-ranged B-52.|$|E
5|$|A luxurious ball {{followed}} the wedding on 20 May. Louis Stanislas found his wife repulsive; she was considered ugly, tedious, and {{ignorant of the}} customs of the court of Versailles. The marriage remained unconsummated for years. Biographers disagree about the reason. The most common theories propose Louis Stanislas' alleged impotence (according to biographer Antonia Fraser) or his unwillingness to sleep with his wife due to her poor personal hygiene. She never brushed her teeth, plucked her eyebrows, or used any perfumes. At {{the time of his}} marriage, Louis Stanislas was obese and waddled instead of walked. He never exercised and continued to eat <b>enormous</b> <b>amounts</b> of food.|$|E
5|$|Past eruptions of Quizapu Crater ejected <b>enormous</b> <b>amounts</b> of ash that {{traveled}} {{as far as}} Brazil. After the 1932 eruption, {{the local}} vegetation was devastated, and the area remained barren until the 1990s, though human life was not impacted. Despite the extent of its eruptions, the threat to humans from Quizapu is relatively small because of the remote location of Cerro Azul. Nevertheless, the size of past eruptions is large enough for scientists to be worried. Evidence of a potentially deadly threat lies in a lahar at Descabezado Grande. Historically, lahars have killed thousands in the Andes. There is, however, a possibility that a large reservoir of rhyodacite magma may exist under the Azul–Descabezado complex. If this is the case, all previous eruptions in 1846–1967 were only preliminary, preclimactic leaks from the large magma chamber beneath, and a large caldera-forming eruption may be expected in the future.|$|E

25|$|A {{solution}} for landing returning military aircraft developed in World War II was called Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO). It involved burning <b>enormous</b> <b>amounts</b> of fuel alongside runways to evaporate fog, allowing returning fighter and bomber pilots sufficient visual cues to safely land their aircraft. The high energy demands {{of this method}} discourage its use for routine operations.|$|E
25|$|All proto- and mid-life stars radiate <b>enormous</b> <b>amounts</b> {{of energy}} {{generated}} by fusion processes. Mass for mass, the deuterium–tritium fusion process releases roughly {{three times as}} much energy as uranium-235 fission, and millions of times more energy than a chemical reaction such as the burning of coal. It is the goal of a fusion power station to harness this energy to produce electricity.|$|E
25|$|An extreme {{form of a}} {{magnetized}} {{neutron star}} is the magnetar. These are formed {{as the result of}} a core-collapse supernova. The existence of such stars was confirmed in 1998 with the measurement of the star SGR 1806-20. The magnetic field of this star has increased the surface temperature to 18million K and it releases <b>enormous</b> <b>amounts</b> of energy in gamma ray bursts.|$|E

25|$|Stellar winds {{from young}} {{clusters}} of stars (often with giant or supergiant HII regions surrounding them) and shock waves created by supernovae inject <b>enormous</b> <b>amounts</b> of energy into their surroundings, {{which leads to}} hypersonic turbulence. The resultant structures – of varying sizes – can be observed, such as stellar wind bubbles and superbubbles of hot gas, seen by X-ray satellite telescopes or turbulent flows observed in radio telescope maps.|$|E
25|$|The French Revolution has {{received}} <b>enormous</b> <b>amounts</b> of historical attention, {{both from the}} general public and from scholars and academics. The views of historians, in particular, have been characterised as falling along ideological lines, with disagreement over the significance and the major developments of the Revolution. Alexis de Tocqueville argued that the Revolution was a manifestation of a more prosperous middle class becoming conscious of its social importance.|$|E
