5|$|Film noir is {{also known}} for its use of low-angle, wide-angle, and skewed, or Dutch angle shots. Other devices of {{disorientation}} relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> mirrors, shots through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects (such as during the strangulation scene in Strangers on a Train), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. Night-for-night shooting, {{as opposed to the}} Hollywood norm of day-for-night, was often employed. From the mid-1940s forward, location shooting became increasingly frequent in noir.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, a {{biochemical}} polymorphism {{study was}} conducted in four sample areas of the species.

At the least, the findings give an indication of the kind of genetic variation that may be found between populations within a species. The amount of variation was similar to findings in examinations of Peromyscus polionotus, Sigmodon, and Dipodomys.|$|E

5|$|Many organs, {{particularly}} those {{built in the}} early 20th century, are contained <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> rooms called organ chambers.

5|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of galaxies have been catalogued, {{but only a few}} have well-established names, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, the Whirlpool Galaxy, and the Sombrero Galaxy. Astronomers work with numbers from certain catalogues, such as the Messier catalogue, the NGC (New General Catalogue), the IC (Index Catalogue), the CGCG (Catalogue of Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies), the MCG (Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies) and UGC (Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies).

5|$|Vitamins are {{essential}} for the normal growth and development of a multicellular organism. Using the genetic blueprint inherited from its parents, a fetus begins to develop from the nutrients it absorbs. It requires certain vitamins and minerals to be present at certain times. These nutrients facilitate the chemical reactions that produce among other things, skin, bone, and muscle. If there is serious deficiency <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> of these nutrients, a child may develop a deficiency disease. Even minor deficiencies may cause permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|A {{multiple}} sequence alignment (MSA) is {{a sequence}} alignment {{of three or}} more biological sequences, generally protein, DNA, or RNA. In many cases, the input set of query sequences are assumed to have an evolutionary relationship by which they share a lineage and are descended from a common ancestor. From the resulting MSA, sequence homology can be inferred and phylogenetic analysis can be conducted to assess the sequences' shared evolutionary origins. Visual depictions of the alignment as in the image at right illustrate mutation events such as point mutations (single amino acid or nucleotide changes) that appear as differing characters in a single alignment column, and insertion or deletion mutations (indels or gaps) that appear as hyphens <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> of the sequences in the alignment. Multiple sequence alignment {{is often used to}} assess sequence conservation of protein domains, tertiary and secondary structures, and even individual amino acids or nucleotides.|$|E

Members Fafa (Famantanantsoa Andriamihaingo Rajaonarison) and Dadah (Andrianabelina Rakotobe) also play guitar and sing; Nono (Andrianabela Rakotobe) played bass and acoustic guitar. Charle (Charle-Bert Andrianaivo), the only {{member of the}} group who does not play guitar, provides vocals and percussion.

5|$|In the 4th century, the {{production}} of weapons and equipment was highly centralised (and presumably standardised) {{in a number of}} major state-run arms factories, or fabricae, documented in the Notitia. It is unknown when these were first established, but they certainly existed by the time of Diocletian. In the 2nd century, there is evidence of fabricae inside legionary bases and even in the much smaller auxiliary forts, staffed by the soldiers themselves. But there is no evidence, literary or archaeological, of fabricae outside military bases and staffed by civilians during the Principate (although their existence cannot be excluded, as no archaeological evidence has been found for the late fabricae either). Late fabricae were located in border provinces and dioceses. Some were general manufacturers producing both armour and weapons (fabrica scutaria et armorum) or just one of the two. Others were specialised <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> of the following: fabrica spatharia (sword manufacture), lanciaria (spears), arcuaria (bows), sagittaria (arrows), loricaria (body armour), clibanaria (cataphract armour), and ballistaria (catapults).|$|E
5|$|Neurocognitive {{symptoms}}, such as fatigue, mood disturbances, {{and other}} related symptoms are common sequelae. Even in those who have made good neurological recovery, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and cognitive impairment are common; 46 {{percent of people who}} have had a subarachnoid hemorrhage have cognitive impairment that affects their quality of life. Over 60 percent report frequent headaches. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage may lead to damage of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, two areas of the brain that {{play a central role in}} hormonal regulation and production. More than a quarter of people with a previous SAH may develop hypopituitarism (deficiencies <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> of the hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone).|$|E
5|$|Playing {{the organ}} before {{electricity}} required {{at least one}} person to operate the bellows. When signaled by the organist, a calcant would operate a set of bellows, supplying the organ with air. Because calcants were expensive, organists would usually practise on other instruments such as the clavichord or harpsichord. By the mid-19th-century bellows were also being operated by water engines, steam engines or gasoline engines. Starting in the 1860s bellows were gradually replaced by wind turbines which were later directly connected to electrical motors. This made it possible for organists to practice regularly on the organ. Most organs, both new and historic, have electric blowers, although others can still be operated manually. The wind supplied is stored <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> regulators to maintain a constant pressure in the windchests until the action allows it to flow into the pipes.|$|E
