50|$|The {{receiver}} {{is made of}} {{an impact}} modified glass reinforced Zytel. The front end houses a <b>hinge</b> <b>block</b> holding the barrel and the rear sight. This block is securely locked in place by a swiveling trigger guard. The receiver rigidly attaches to the stock by multiple lugs. The bottom of the receiver forms the pistol grip, also accepting different magazines according to the version specified. The receiver also houses the firing mechanism. The 4130 ordnance steel barrel has a spring-loaded collar to ensure an accurate lock between the receiver and the polymer fore end and the fully adjustable front sight. The fore end also has integrated the ability to house batteries and/or other small devices. The tubular steel stock contains the bolt and is ended by the polymer butt stock. The heavy two-piece steel bolt holds the firing pin, the extractor and has the operating handle on the bottom. A captive guide recoil spring with buffer actuates the bolt. The firing mechanism is of conventional single action type. It has a positive disconnector, a push bolt safety that blocks the sear and disengages the trigger bar. The hardened steel ejector is internal. This design, with its long bolt travel, allows for very large functioning marginals.|$|E

The Allin action made by Springfield Arsenal in the US hinged forward; the Snider-Enfield used by the British opened to the side. Whereas the British quickly replaced the Snider with a dropping-block Peabody-style Martini action, the US Army felt the trapdoor action to be adequate and followed its muzzleloader conversions with the new-production Springfield Model 1873, which was the principal longarm of the Indian Wars and was still in service with some units in the Spanish-American War.|$|R

Firing force is transmitted through the knuckle of the hinge and does not act directly on the hinge pin. The breechblock design as has been called a falling or tilting block but in omitting the role of the hinge can lead to ambiguities. It is also used in the Krag-Petersson rifle.|$|R

40|$|Analysis of the {{glycosylation}} {{of human}} serum IgD and IgE indicated that oligomannose structures are present on both Igs. The relative {{proportion of the}} oligomannose glycans {{is consistent with the}} occupation of one N-linked site on each heavy chain. We evaluated the accessibility of the oligomannose glycans on serum IgD and IgE to mannan-binding lectin (MBL). MBL {{is a member of the}} collectin family of proteins, which binds to oligomannose sugars. It has already been established that MBL binds to other members of the Ig family, such as agalactosylated glycoforms of IgG and polymeric IgA. Despite the presence of potential ligands, MBL does not bind to immobilized IgD and IgE. Molecular modeling of glycosylated human IgD Fc suggests that the oligomannose glycans located at Asn 354 are inaccessible because the complex glycans at Asn 445 block access to the site. On IgE, the additional C H 2 <b>hinge</b> domain <b>blocks</b> access to the oligomannose glycans at Asn 394 on one H chain by adopting an asymmetrically bent conformation. IgE contains 8. 3 % Man 5 GlcNAc 2 glycans, which are the trimmed products of the Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 oligomannose precursor. The presence of these structures suggests that the C H 2 domain flips between two bent quaternary conformations so that the oligomannose glycans on each chain become accessible for limited trimming to Man 5 GlcNAc 2 during glycan biosynthesis.

40|$|We {{developed}} a high-throughput HTRF (homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence) assay for Akt kinase activity and screened approx.   270000 compounds {{for their ability}} to inhibit the three isoforms of Akt. Two Akt inhibitors were identified that exhibited isoenzyme specificity. The first compound (Akt-I- 1) inhibited only Akt 1 (IC 50 4. 6  μM) while the second compound (Akt-I- 1, 2) inhibited both Akt 1 and Akt 2 with IC 50 values of 2. 7 and 21  μM respectively. Neither compound inhibited Akt 3 nor mutants lacking the PH (pleckstrin homology) domain at concentrations up to 250  μM. These compounds were reversible inhibitors, and exhibited a linear mixed-type inhibition against ATP and peptide substrate. In addition to inhibiting kinase activity of individual Akt isoforms, both inhibitors blocked the phosphorylation and activation of the corresponding Akt isoforms by PDK 1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1). A model is proposed in which these inhibitors bind to a site formed only {{in the presence of the}} PH domain. Binding of the inhibitor is postulated to promote the formation of an inactive conformation. In support of this model, antibodies to the Akt PH domain or <b>hinge</b> region <b>blocked</b> the inhibition of Akt by Akt-I- 1 and Akt-I- 1, 2.

50|$|At about 5:30 pm, Chapline boarded Tampico. At the time, Malpica's leg {{was covered}} in bandages; {{a week or so}} earlier, he had accidentally fired his {{revolver}} into his foot and could barely walk during the final battle.

The U.S. Navy officers inspected the Mexican gunboat, which was armed with two 4 inch guns, two 6-pounders and one machine gun on the bridge. The Tampico had a raised deck forward and aft, each of which mounted one of the 4 inch rapid-fire guns. Four other 6-pounder guns were originally part of Tampicos armament, but they had been removed before the campaign.

Two adducts of + 45 and + 71 Da were also observed at the N-terminal residues of some Fc fragments and were identified as isocyanate and α-ketoacyl derivatives generated by radical cleavage at the α-carbon position through the diamide and α-amidation pathways. We determined that the hinge cleavage was initiated by radical-induced breakage of the disulfide bond between the two hinge cysteines at position 231 (Cys 231 -Pro-Pro-Cys-Pro), followed by the formation of a thiyl radical (Cys 231 -S•) on one cysteine and sulfenic acid (Cys 231 -SOH) on the other. The location of the initial radical attack and the critical role of Cys 231 were demonstrated by the observation that 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyrroline N-oxide only reacted with the Cys 231 radical and completely <b>blocked</b> <b>hinge</b> cleavage, suggesting the necessity of an electron/radical transfer from the Cys 231 radical to the hinge residues where cleavage was observed.

40|$|Typically, {{aircraft}} {{roll control}} {{is accomplished by}} simultaneously moving ailerons together and in opposite angular direction. Nevertheless, throughout the flying range, more particularly in cruise conditions, it is highly desirable to increase aircraft aerodynamic performance by a differential control of the lift distribution over the wing span. Recent European design studies concerning morphing devices, such as the Clean Sky multifunctional flap or the SARISTU trailing edge device, have largely proved the potential of novel aircraft structural systems, aiming at adaptively modify the wing structural shape to reduce the induced drag penalty associated with off-design flight conditions. In particular, wing camber variation was achieved through adaptive wing trailing edges because of the highly associated L/D ratio enhancements. Such projects proved also the aileron region {{to be the one}} where higher cruise benefits could be achieved by local camber variations. Following the enthusiastic results, achieved with the Adaptive trailing edge device, a new challenge has been faced up. The former configuration did in fact refer to the standard position of the flap, leaving apart the aileron region. There are several reasons to leave that part unchanged. The most relevant may be associated {{to the fact that the}} aileron has a critical function in the aircraft flight and its collapse could lead to dramatic failures. The investigated configuration would have lied over an extended region of the aileron instead than a limited part, as in the case of a flap, characterised by a large chord. As a direct consequence, the available volumes are reduced and the installation of integrated actuators could have been a problem. Finally, the aeroelastic response of the device is critical as well and its strong modification should have been deeply studied. On the other hand, the studies on the ATED showed as the region, farer from the root, gave a more significant contribution to the aerodynamic behaviour. So, it was really interesting to investigate the possibility to extend the adaptive trailing edge technology to the aileron region. The occasion was given by a joint Italian/Canadian research activity fostered by the Consortium de Recherche et d’Innovation en Aerospatiale au Quebec (CRIAQ). The activity aimed at realising a full-scale demonstrator of a wing section in the tip region for investigating the capability of wing box and trailing edge morphing device, to ensure a certain level of flow control and aerodynamic performance variations, respectively. The first issue was in charge of the Canadian team (ETS, NRC, Thales Aerospace, Bombardier AS), while the Italian group (University of Naples and CIRA) aimed at realising a device for the aileron camber control. The enlisted problems were all evident at the very first approach. Volume limitation forced the designers to follow a different strategy. Instead of having a couple of actuators acting on each rib, the architectural layout was specialised per each single bay. At the aileron root this possibility was maintained, while the more external two bays were commanded by a single actuator. In other words, the last two segments were made of two slave and a master ribs, driven by a single actuator. Calculation showed as this configuration was able to maintain the specified loads. Aeroelastic studies confirmed the reliability of the device, in sense that the selected architecture was demonstrated to be safe in the design flight conditions. The adaptive aileron finally maintained the original capability while ensuring morphing characteristic. This target was accomplished by realising a device with two separate motor system. The first, acting on the main aileron shaft, to preserve its characteristic dynamic response for flight control. The second, acting on the rib, implemented the searched camber variations to follow the aerodynamic necessities related to fuel consumption. Another relevant point concerns the skin. In order to check the possibility of skipping the need of implementing a compliant solution, a heavy and sophisticated element, the single <b>hinged</b> <b>blocks</b> were properly shaped to slide one into the other like a meniscus. This solution was however strongly correlated to manufacture tolerances and the assembly precision, because small deviation could have had a significant impact on the kinematic performance. As usual, vantages and disadvantages try to compensate each other. The innovative device can be considered as a system with augmented capabilities aimed at working in cruise, by means of symmetric deflection, to obtain a near optimum wing geometry enabling optimal aerodynamic performance. The approach, including underlying concepts and analytical formulations, combines design methodologies and tools required to develop such an innovative control surface. A major difficulty in the development of morphing devices is to reach an adequate compromise between high load-carrying capacity to withstand aerodynamic loads and sufficient flexibility to achieve the target shapes. These targets necessitate the use of innovative structural and actuation solutions. When dealing with adaptive structures for lifting surfaces, the level of complexity naturally increases as a consequence of the augmented functionality of the designed system. In specific, an adaptive structure ensures a controlled and fully reversible transition from a baseline shape to a set of different configurations, each one capable of withstanding the associated external loads. To this aim, a dedicated actuation system shall be designed. In addition, the adopted morphing structural kinematics shall demonstrate complete functionality under operative loads. Such a morphing device wants to augment the former device by adapting local wing camber shape and lift distribution through a quasi-static deflection, its excursion ranging into few unit of degrees, positive and negative. In a morphing aircraft design concept, the actuated system stiffness, load capacity and integral volumetric requirements drive flutter, strength and aerodynamic performance. Design studies concerning aircraft flight speed, manoeuvre load factor and actuator response provide sensitivities in structural weight, aeroelastic performance and actuator flight load distributions. Based on these considerations, actuation mechanism constitutes a very fundamental aspect for adaptive structures design because the main prerequisite is to accomplish variable shapes within the physical constraints established by the appropriate actuation arrangement. This thesis addresses the design of a morphing aileron with a specific focus on the structural actuation system sizing and integration while the structural sizing was under Unina responsibility. Particular focus is given to the numerical validation of the entire aileron integrated with the actuation leverage by means of FE model and experimental tests campaign. The aileron actuation system is driven by load bearing servo-electromechanic rotary actuator in a distributed and un-shafted arrangement which combine load carrying and actuation capacities. The use of electro-mechanical actuators is coherent with a “more electric approach” for next-generation aircraft design. Such an actuation architecture allows the control of the morphing structure by using a reduced mass, volume, force and consumed power with respect to conventional solutions. Benefits are obvious. No hydraulic supply buses (easier to maintain and store without hydraulics leaks), improved torque control, more efficiency without fluid losses and elimination of flammable fluids. In addition, it is potentially possible to move individual ribs either synchronously or independently to different angles (twist) in order to enhance aerodynamic benefits during flight. On the other side, actuators susceptibility to jamming may represent the most important drawback that can be tested and prevented by means of an iron bird facility. Finally, the realised system was assembled onto a wing model and tested in a wind tunnel at the National Research Council (NRC) facilities in Ottawa (CAN). On the same model, the adaptive wing box was also installed. The adaptive aileron device proved its functionality in real flow conditions and the main aerodynamic results are herein presented and widely described. The developed device has a lot of further potentialities, that will be object of further works and publications and that are currently explored by the authors: for instance, by giving it a large bandwidth, it could be used as an additional load alleviation device for the outer wing in order to reduce peak loads for gusts. Moreover it can be tailored for active load control distribution in order to modify spanwise lift distribution obtaining a reduced wing root bending moment; in such a manner a lightweight design can be assessed...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, masonry churches under {{horizontal}} actions are studied. Such structures feature strong seismic vulnerability, {{both because of}} the mechanical properties of the material and the particular configuration. Besides, uncertainty of the conventional seismic action is detected. Different codes provide different spectra and, subsequently, different total seismic actions. In order to assess such difficulties, the four basilicas of SGMR, SI, SGMG and SP have been selected. These study cases are analysed with a two step procedure in which the whole structure is analyzed in the linear field through a complete 3 D model, and then the single structural elements are assessed in non linear field through FEA and limit analyses. The following remarks can be stated: Certain uniformity in the global plan-altimetric apparatus can be recognised so that the four churches {{can be regarded as}} deriving from a sort of three-dimensional global model that changes only for a scale factor. Similarly, a common structural behaviour is expected and in the analyses confirmed. The modal shapes for the analyzed buildings show low torsional and transversal stiffness and great out of the plane deformation. When rigid diaphragms are inserted to model retrofit interventions, greater global stiffness (especially in terms of torsion) and a more monolithic behaviour is detected. It is noticed, furthermore, a stress concentration in the stiffer elements of the buildings (façade elements and in the transept zone) which absorb a larger amount of the total shear. Given the already stated uncertainty in the characterisation of seismic actions, assessment of the behaviour at collapse through spectrum-independent analyses is preferable. In this aim, advanced nonlinear analyses using the code ABAQUS are carried out on the single macro-elements constituting the structural complex. This approach is apparently the most accurate methodology for structural analyses. The results, in fact, are reliable only providing that very precise material characterisation is made. This can be very tricky for historical existing structures. Additional difficulties also derive from the complex geometrical configuration of the studied non-conventional structures. Load-displacement curves providing the collapse multiplier, the horizontal stiffness and the maximum displacement of some control points are obtained for all the macro-elements. These curves are compared with the elastic demands derived through global analyses. It has been shown that generally the bearing capacity of these elements is smaller than the strength demand. Therefore, these constructions are prone to damage and retrofit techniques are necessary. The presence of a rigid slab {{at the height of the}} roof has not improved at all the seismic behaviour of the study cases. On the contrary, the effective use of such retrofit technique has to be carefully evaluated specially when adopted in ancient constructions. In the light of the analyses conducted on these complex constructions it is derived that is quite hard following a unique procedure able to define with consistency the most influencing quantities. Therefore, the necessity of defining a handy and suitable methodology for designers is strongly felt. In order to seek a simplified procedure on churches macroelements, a basic structural element in historical buildings, such as the portal frame, has been studied in detail. An analytical exact expression, derived using the kinematic theorem, and an approximate formula have been used for performing a parametric analysis varying geometrical proportions. The extension of the single portal frame to the multi-bay frame has been applied in order to perform the comparison between non linear analyses and simplified analyses. The use of approximate expressions derived for the portal frame implies an averaging of the pier widths. When the medium value is taken into account, generally, greater error percentages are encountered in the model with the load condition considering the only self weight: in this case, the non linear analyses give higher values; on the contrary the limit analysis gives small values of the collapse multiplier. In the load condition of self weight plus dead load, the scatters are smaller. When the maximum pier is taken into account, the values of non linear analysis will be the same but limit analysis values will assume greater values, moving on the right side so that are inside the domain. This evidence has been confirmed for the churches of SGMR, SI and SP. On the contrary, in the church of SGMG, medium values have shown a better comparison with non linear procedure. In the last part of the thesis, the structural behaviour of another typical element in ancient structures is sought: it is the masonry arch. In order to determine the thrust ranges and the minimum thickness, a parametric analysis has been carried out on whole and half arches. A theory for the displacement of the supports has been developed: pointed arches can bear greater displacement than circular arches. This result is confirmed moving one of the supports in any direction into the plane and tracing the domains of possible positions. All the theoretical values have been checked with two different codes and the results agree well. Later, in order to verify these values, an extensive experimental campaign has been held on rigid concrete blocks in small scale representing eight different pointed arches varying eccentricity, the thickness and the angle of embrace. Five types of test were made on the arches: first, friction coefficient measures were taken on the blocks; then moving the supports horizontally apart and together, and vertically up and down. The comparison of theoretical and experimental results has allowed to emphasize the limits of both of them. Perfect <b>hinges,</b> sharp <b>blocks,</b> exactly symmetric structures, absence of friction, all accepted hypothesis in the theory, can never exist in reality; as a consequence the theoretical numerical results are greater than those measured in the experiments. At the same time the presented methods correctly predicted the final collapse mechanisms for the circular and specially the pointed arches. In the light of the conducted experiences in this study, in terms of modelling, analysis and testing, it is believed that masonry structures deserve great attention in the design and assessment process. Many mistakes can be made regarding the basic assumptions on the constitutive model of the material, the suitable structural modelling, the choice of the seismic action and an effective retrofit techniques. Furthermore, churches are more sensitive to damages than other “conventional” structures for their characteristic typology. The main features of these structures have been drawn throughout this work so that whatever similar building will fairly show the same topics here presented. About the material properties, only experimental campaigns on the structural constituents of the building under study could provide a good characterization. Regarding the suitable analysis types, undoubtedly, a global three-dimensional analysis is necessary to get the general idea of the construction and understand its behaviour. On the other side, a useful quantitative result is the evaluation of the ultimate condition at collapse on bi-dimensional elements. This consideration is also made since the definition of the seismic forces for masonry structures according to different code provisions is not unique. Simplified approaches do prove their appeal. Though some approximations are unavoidably to be made, in the aim of assessing the structural behaviour of ultimate capacity, such techniques seem to provide a very interesting path to follow in the futur...|$|R
40|$|Archeologists from Geo-Marine, Inc., were {{subcontracted}} through Prewitt and Associates, Inc., of Austin {{to conduct}} National Register of Historic Places evaluative testing at archeological site 41 TR 170, located in Tarrant County, Texas. This work (Geo-Marine project number 30353. 06. 02) was {{conducted for the}} Environmental Affairs Division of the Texas Department of Transportation under contract/work authorization 57524 SA 006. The archeological remains are located on and in the alluvial terrace of the Clear Fork of the Trinity River, within the proposed 130 -meter-wide right-of-way of State Highway 121 in southwestern Fort Worth. The work was conducted to comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1969, as amended (Public Law 89 - 665); the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 (Public Law 89 - 670); and the Antiquities Code of Texas, as incorporated into Title 98, Chapter 191, of the Natural Resources Code of Texas of 1977, as amended. The work was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 3699 issued by the Texas Historical Commission. A three-stage field tactic was used during the testing of the site. Stage 1, conducted between March 15 and 29, 2005, consisted of archeological monitoring of the mechanical excavation of 28 backhoe trenches, followed by geomorphological field studies of the trench profiles. Trenches were placed both {{north and south of}} a relic channel of the Clear Fork of the Trinity River; the present channel was formed in the late 1960 s by river-straightening channelization efforts. Efforts were made to ensure archeological sampling of all feature- and artifact-bearing areas previously identified in trenches dug during the 2000 archeological survey. The second stage, which occurred between March 21 and April 29, 2005, involved the manual excavation of 10 test units to depths of 2 meters below surface using standard 10 -centimeter-thick levels. The purpose of this phase was to assess the reliability of the backhoe trench monitoring activities and to locate occupation zones worthy of further excavations. The third stage of field investigations was conducted between May 2 and June 3, 2005, and consisted of the mechanical stripping of the overburden above target occupation surfaces and the manual excavation of three block excavations, each 9 square meters, to a depth of 40 centimeters below surface. Upon completion of the fieldwork, a fourth stage comprised a limited analysis to document the nature of the recovered assemblage and to make National Register recommendations about the site, and a final stage was to design a plan for further study or analysis that would then be {{based on the results of}} an interim report. The geomorphic investigations, coupled with the processing of eight radiocarbon dates, ascertained that the upper 2 meters of the Clear Fork sediments date to the past 2, 900 years. All trenches contained evidence of the regionally dominant West Fork paleosol that is buried under a thin layer of recent alluvium. Beneath the West Fork paleosol were grayish and yellowish clayey strata, and stringers of pea-sized gravels could be correlated to many of the trenches onsite. The substrate for a series of trenches dug into the south edge of the site encountered cemented gravels that likely date to the Pleistocene age. These gravels extend above the Holocene alluvial sediments onsite and provide some minor relief above the floodplain. Although some bioturbation has blurred boundaries between the West Fork paleosol and more recent sediments, the degree of sediment movement is not as pronounced as observed in many other parts of Texas. The excavations generally documented a series of low-density, highly stratified occupations that could not be correlated with any great assurance. The site context and integrity of deposits are generally excellent. Nevertheless, the paucity of remains in most areas is generally insufficient to provide data necessary to address many regional research questions. Site 41 TR 170 is not unique in this regard, because many sites within the Trinity River basin seem to be short-term specialized logistical extractive activity areas rather than campsites. Two areas of 41 TR 170, however, seem to be exceptions to low-density, brief occupations and contain a range of features unlike any previously encountered or recorded in the Clear Fork of the Trinity River. In an area located about 60 meters north of the relic river channel, Block 2 exposed part of a deeply buried (180 – 220 centimeters below surface) ashy zone with abundant charcoal flecks and burned clay daub that occasionally retained impressions of sticks and small posts. Three burned rock features (small pits, scattered rocks, and rock dump concentrations) were found within this ashy zone, but they were not associated with the genesis of the ash. Bone preservation in this zone was good (numbering 121 specimens), but only one stone tool and four pieces of manufacture/maintenance debris were found. Based on the stratigraphic position and the recovery of one unclassified dart point, this feature is possibly Transitional Archaic in affiliation. Indeed, four radiocarbon dates from two features and the top and bottom of the ashy zone reaffirm that the occupation dates between A. D. 540 and 710 (two sigma dates, tree-ring calibrated), and relates to the Transitional Archaic period. The genesis of the thick ashy zone is problematic and not well understood. The radiocarbon dates suggest that the 40 -centimeter-thick ashy zone did not develop instantaneously but rather apparently accumulated over a span of about 180 years (ca. 1, 270 and 1, 450 years ago). Even though a few rock features and some relatively high density of bone are preserved in this ashy sediment, the low density of remains suggests that the deposit cannot be considered an occupation midden. The age range also suggests that this is not a burned architectural structure. The formation process resulting in a 40 -centimeter-thick ashy zone remains unknown. In an area almost 150 meters south of the relic channel, an extensive area of burned rock covering at least 12 -x- 12 meters was encountered. Noncontiguous Blocks 1 and 3 were opened to explore the variability of burned rock features and ascertain the kinds of remains present. The recovery of two dart points (a Trinity and a Yarbrough) at comparable depths of 90 to 130 centimeters below surface suggests that this area along the edge of the Pleistocene gravel terrace was repeatedly occupied during the Late Archaic period. Among the burned rock features revealed in Block 3 was one large incipient burned rock oven with a pit measuring 2. 54 meters in diameter surrounded by a discard ring of burned rocks that were only some 20 centimeters thick. Another cluster of burned rock more deeply buried in the sediments suggests multiple occupations. In adjacent Block 1 were two smaller (possible) pit ovens about 1 meter in diameter, an elongated pile of rock stored for reuse, a few rake-off piles or dumps, and one area of fitted burned rock that might have served as a large griddle-like feature. Tools and chipped stone debris were moderately abundant in Block 1, but rare in Block 3. Bone preservation in this area was very poor, although several hundred fragments of scattered freshwater mussel shell were present. Analysis of shell umbos or hinges indicates that about 59 shells were present in Block 1 and only 50 <b>hinges</b> in <b>Block</b> 3; none were concentrated into discrete discard features. The size, density, and morphological variability of the burned rock features are unlike anything previously seen in the Trinity River basin. Four radiocarbon dates from Blocks 1 and 3 suggest that the series of occupations date between A. D. 540 and 780 (2 -sigma dates, tree-ring calibrated). Indeed the radiocarbon dates indicate that the activities resulting in the accumulation of dense burned rock features exposed in Blocks 1 and 3 are culturally contemporaneous with the activities occurring in the thick ashy zone located some 170 to 210 meters apart, even though they undoubtedly represent multiple reuse of the area. The two areas may not have been occupied simultaneously, for the low artifact density suggests that comparable groups of people from the Transitional Archaic period made the distinctly different occupational signatures in the two areas. The testing phase of work at 41 TR 170 has documented considerable variability in feature forms during the Transitional Archaic period for the Trinity River basin. Test probes also strongly suggest that many more burned rock features occur parallel to the Pleistocene gravel terrace. In this regard, the testing has not exhausted the information potential related to the spatial patterning in activities by these people. However, the associated stone, shell, and bone artifact assemblages are relatively meager. Similarly, extensive flotation has failed to find any macrobotanical remains other than a single nutshell and small amounts of wood charcoal. Efforts to retrieve lipids samples from the burned rock feature proved to be successful, but the results were not very helpful in providing insight into the diversity of feature activities. Although examination of more burned rock features may stumble on examples of cooking accidents that preserve ancient foodstuff, the current robust level of testing suggests that the information content from the site is relatively limited. For this reason, even though the site is of considerable interest from a regional perspective, the site seemingly does not have the potential to make further contributions to the knowledge of the region. Thus, site 41 TR 170 fails to meet the standards of Criterion D or any other significance standard required for assessing National Register eligibility. Site 41 TR 170 is recommended as not eligible for National Register inclusion, and no further archeological investigations are recommended...|$|R
