40|$|LHP: An <b>end-to-end</b> {{reliable}} <b>transport</b> protocol over wireless data networks Abstract—The {{next generation}} wireless networks are posited to support large scale data applications. Implementing end-to-end TCP in such networks faces two problems. First, {{it is well}} known that TCP can not distinguish packet losses due to link failures and that due to network congestion. Second, TCP congestion control mechanism does not deal effectively with large amount of out-oforder packet retransmissions; this problem has received less attention in literature. In this paper, we present solutions to both these problems. In particular, we present a Link Layer Protection (LHP) protocol which implements Explicit Loss Notification (ELN) in a simple, scalable manner, addressing the first problem. We also modify the congestion control mechanism to incorporate knowledge of ELN and packet loss pattern into retransmission decisions, solving the second problem. We combine both these solutions with TCP to present scalable, reliable <b>end-to-end</b> wireless <b>transport</b> protocol. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop an}} {{analysis}} using which we compare {{the performance of}} TCP, with and without <b>end-to-end</b> ATM/ABR <b>transport,</b> when the network bandwidth is shared with time-varying CBR/VBR traffic. We show that, over ABR, the performance of TCP improves by more than 20 % if the network bottleneck bandwidth variations are slow. Further, we find that TCP over ABR is relatively insensitive to bottleneck buffer size. We then validate the analytical results with results from a hybrid simulation on a TCP testbed that we have developed. We use this simulation to study two mechanisms for bottleneck rate feedback at the ABR level. We find that an effective capacity based feedback is adaptive to the rate of bandwidth variations at the bottleneck link, and thus yields good performance {{over a wide range}} of rates of bottleneck bandwidth variation. 1 Introduction As the ABR service does not guarantee <b>end-to-end</b> reliable <b>transport</b> of data to the applications above it ([2]), in the first deployments of ATM ne [...] ...|$|R

A central problem in wireless transports is obtaining reliable metrics of congestion. How can lower layers assist transports {{and what is the}} performance tradeoff with pure peer-to-peer end-to-end solutions? In this paper we design and evaluate a lower layer assistance architecture. We focus on adding minimal intelligence to lower layers, according to the end-to-end principle. We find that we can adequately solve the measurement problem by minimal MAC assistance and describe an architecture that can aid transports over wireless links. The MAC-assisted solution is scalable to large number of flows, where the performance of pure <b>end-to-end</b> <b>transports</b> deteriorates rapidly. An improvement factor of 30 to 50 is exhibited in our experiments. We argue that including this minimal additional functionality in the MAC is sufficient for transports.

50|$|However, the End-to-end {{principle}} {{claims that}} transport control should be implemented end-to-end unless implementing hop-by-hop transport achieves considerably better performance. Moreover, hop-by-hop transport requires per-flow state information at intermediate nodes, which limits its scalability.

5000|$|The {{design of}} {{protocols}} in the TCP/IP {{model of the}} Internet does not concern itself with strict hierarchical encapsulation and layering. RFC 3439 contains a section entitled [...] "Layering considered harmful". TCP/IP does recognize four broad layers of functionality which are derived from the operating scope of their contained protocols: {{the scope of the}} software application; the <b>end-to-end</b> <b>transport</b> connection; the internetworking range; and the scope of the direct links to other nodes on the local network.|$|E
50|$|The current {{architecture}} just provides two scopes: {{data link}} (scope of layers 1 and 2), and global (scope of layers 3 and 4). However, layer 4 is just {{implemented in the}} hosts, therefore the “network side” of the Internet ends at layer 3. This means that the current Internet is able to handle a network with heterogeneous physical links, {{but it is not}} designed to handle heterogeneous networks, although {{this is supposed to be}} its operation. To be able to do it, it would require an “Internetwork” scope, which is now missing. As ironic as it may sound, the current Internet is not really an internetwork, but a concatenation of IP networks with an <b>end-to-end</b> <b>transport</b> layer on top of them. The consequences of this ﬂaw are several: both inter-domain and intra-domain routing have to happen within the network layer, and its scope had to be artiﬁcially isolated through the introduction of the concept of Autonomous System (Internet) and an Exterior Gateway Protocol; Network Address Translation (NATs) appeared as middleboxes in order to have a means of partitioning and reusing parts of the single IP address space.|$|E

Early in 1972 the International Network Working Group (INWG) was created to bring {{together}} the nascent network research community. One of the early tasks it accomplished was voting an international network transport protocol, which was approved in 1976. A remarkable aspect is that the selected option, {{as well as all}} the other candidates, had an architecture composed of three layers of increasing scope: data link (to handle different types of physical media), network (to handle different types of networks) and internetwork (to handle a network of networks), each layer with its own addresses. When TCP/IP was introduced it ran at the internetwork layer on top of the Network Control Program and other network technologies. But when NCP was shut down, TCP/IP took the network role and the internetwork layer was lost. As a result, the Internet ceased to be an Internet and became a concatenation of IP networks with an <b>end-to-end</b> <b>transport</b> layer on top. A consequence of this decision is the complex routing system required today, with both intra-domain and inter-domain routing happening at the network layer [...] or the use of NAT, Network Address Translation, as a mechanism for allowing independent address spaces within a single network layer.|$|E

30|$|Broadly speaking, {{there are}} two types of {{approaches}} for reliable data transport, namely, endtoend and hopbyhop. Many studies have shown that the end-to-end approach is infeasible for terrestrial sensor networks [3 – 5]. This conclusion still holds in underwater sensor networks and is additionally justified by the large propagation delay and the high error probability. The very large end-to-end delay introduces difficulties for the two ends to manage data transmission timely, while the high channel error probability makes the success probability of <b>end-to-end</b> data <b>transport</b> rather low which results in too many retransmissions for a success packet delivery. Thus, the hop-by-hop approaches are more appropriate for UWSNs.|$|R
