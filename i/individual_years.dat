5|$|Rivera's 2008 {{season was}} one of his best <b>individual</b> <b>years.</b> Along with a 1.40ERA and 39saves in 40opportunities, he set career bests in {{multiple}} statistical categories, including WHIP (0.67), on-base plus slugging (OPS)-against (.422), batting average against (.165), save percentage (97.5%), walks (6), earned runs (11), and blown saves (1). He averaged 9.81strikeouts per 9 innings pitched, his best mark as a closer. He pitched with such control that his 12.83strikeout-to-walk ratio made him the second MLB pitcher ever to record a figure that high in a season (minimum 50innings pitched). He placed fifth in the AL Cy Young Award voting.|$|E
2500|$|Reuben Fine, {{writing in}} 1976, {{observed}} that Botvinnik was {{at or near}} the top of the chess world for thirty years—from 1933, when he drew a match against Flohr, to 1963, when he lost the world championship for the final time, to Petrosian—"a feat equaled historically only by Emanuel Lasker and Wilhelm Steinitz". The statistical rating system used in Raymond Keene and Nathan Divinsky's book Warriors of the Mind concludes that Botvinnik was the fourth strongest player of all time: behind Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov and Bobby Fischer but ahead of José Raúl Capablanca, Lasker, Viktor Korchnoi, Boris Spassky, Vasily Smyslov and Tigran Petrosian. The Chessmetrics system is sensitive to the length of the periods being compared, but places Botvinnik third in a comparison of players' best <b>individual</b> <b>years</b> (1946 for Botvinnik) and sixth in a comparison of fifteen-year periods (1935–1949 in Botvinnik's case). In 2005 Chessmetrics' creator Jeff Sonas wrote an article which examined various ways of comparing the strength of [...] "world number one" [...] players, some not based on Chessmetrics; and Botvinnik generally emerged as one of the top six (the greatest exceptions were in criteria related to tournament results). [...] FIDE did not adopt the Elo rating system until 1970, by which time Botvinnik's strength had been declining for several years. [...] According to unofficial calculations by Árpád Elo, Botvinnik was the highest-rated player from 1937 to 1954, peaking about 2730 in 1946.|$|E

2500|$|While record-breaking {{years can}} attract {{considerable}} public interest, <b>individual</b> <b>years</b> are less significant than the overall trend. Some climatologists {{have criticized the}} attention that the popular press gives to [...] "warmest year" [...] statistics; for example, Gavin Schmidt stated [...] "the long-term trends or the expected sequence of records are {{far more important than}} whether any single year is a record or not." [...] Of the 2015 and 2016 records, Schmidt stated that the 2014–16 El Niño event was [...] "a factor ... but both 2015 and 2016 would have been records even without it"; he attributed about 90% of the warming in 2016 to anthropogenic climate change. [...] Consistent with Schmidt's comment, the NASA / NOAA announcement stated that [...] "lobally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than the mid-20th century mean" [...] and that the impact of El Niño warming was estimated to have [...] "increased the annual global temperature anomaly for 2016 by 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit (0.12 degrees Celsius)." [...] Comments from climate scientists reported in The Washington Post showed strong agreement in attributing the warming primarily to anthropogenic climate change, with some contribution from El Niño warming, though there were differing views on the significance of individual records. [...] Deke Arndt leads the monitoring group at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information and offered an analogy in a report on NPR: [...] "The long-term warming is a lot like riding up an escalator over time. The longer you're on the escalator, the higher you go. And the El Niño phenomenon is like jumping up and down while you're on the escalator." [...] Arndt also stated that the [...] "long-term warming is driven almost entirely by greenhouse gases." [...] Peter Stott, acting director of the Met Office, noted the influence of the El Niño event on 2016 temperatures but also stated that [...] "the main contributor to warming over the last 150 years is human influence on climate from increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere." [...] Tim Osborn, Director of Research at the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit, agreed stating that [...] "ultiple lines of independent evidence confirm that the planet has warmed over the last 150 years: warmer oceans, warmer land, warmer lower atmosphere and melting ice. This long-term trend is the main cause for the record warmth of 2015 and 2016, surpassing all previous years – even ones with strong El Niño events." ...|$|E
60|$|Nelson, in {{remembrance of}} an old and {{uninterrupted}} friendship, appointed Alexander Davison sole prize agent for the captured ships: upon which Davison ordered medals to be struck in gold, for the captains; in silver, for the lieutenants and warrant officers; in gilt metal for the petty officers; and in copper for the seamen and marines.

Results. <b>Individuals</b> 65 <b>years</b> of age and older were found to exhibit slower reaction times to movements in a con-tralateral direction when compared with movements made in the ipsilateral direction whereas <b>individuals</b> 80 <b>years</b> of age and older were also found to exhibit slower reaction times to movements in a contralateral direction when compared with movements made in the midline and ipsilateral direction.
