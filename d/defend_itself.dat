5|$|Generally, yellow {{stingrays}} pay little heed to divers and can {{be approached}} closely. If stepped on or otherwise provoked, however, this ray will <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> with its tail spine, coated in potent venom. The resulting wound is extremely painful, but seldom life-threatening. Small and docile, the yellow stingray adapts readily to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium; it requires {{a large amount of}} space (at least 180gal or 684L) and a fine, deep substrate with minimal ornamentation.|$|E

This work is done by integrating a reputation-based scheme, to detect, punish and isolate selfish nodes, to currently existing ARAN protocol and then measuring the effectiveness of that integration. 1...|$|R
5|$|Banded sugar ants {{will often}} attack the nests of other ant species at random, while {{ignoring}} other ants nearby. They use their mandibles to hold opponents, and use formic acid to kill them. Foraging workers use visual cues {{to help them}} find their way around, or to let them determine that they are lost; workers will identify landmarks they are familiar with to orientate themselves. When provoked, an individual banded sugar ant will lift up its abdomen and use its large mandibles to fend off an attacker. If further provoked, it can <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> by spraying formic acid from its abdomen to deter predators.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and sedentary, the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} feeds {{mainly on}} polychaete worms and crustaceans. As in all numbfishes, it {{can produce a}} moderate electric shock to <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> against predators. This species gives live birth, with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk; the litter size ranges from one to eight. The Tasmanian numbfish is a common bycatch of trawl fisheries. However, its population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by human activity and it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Females {{can carry}} up to 680,000 eggs, which hatch after 10 weeks into flat phyllosoma larvae. These feed on {{plankton}} before the metamorphosis into the juvenile state. Adults are nocturnal and migratory, living among rocks at depths {{of up to}} , and feeding on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. The spiny lobster is eaten by various fish, octopuses and sea otters, but can <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> with a loud noise produced by its antennae. The California spiny lobster {{is the subject of}} both commercial and recreational fishery in both Mexico and the United States, with sport fishermen using hoop nets and commercial fishermen using lobster traps.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the onefin {{electric}} ray can <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> with a strong electric shock produced {{from a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs beside its head. It feeds mainly on polychaete worms, and likely gives birth to live young. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. It is often caught incidentally by bottom trawl fisheries off South Africa, and may also be impacted by pollution from coastal development.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Hürtgen Forest {{began on}} 19 September, with the assault of the 3rd Armored and 9th Infantry Divisions. The battle quickly turned {{into one of}} attrition; by mid-October the two Allied {{divisions}} had lost nearly 80% of their total combat strength, or roughly 4,500 men, while the Germans had lost close to 3,300. On 2 November the U.S. 28th Infantry Division entered the fight, but {{was not able to}} make headway and was forced to <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> against German counterattacks between 5–7 November. The 28th Infantry Division lost over 6,100 combat casualties in Hürtgen.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{from the}} Japanese sleeper ray is strong but not {{life-threatening}} to humans. There is an observation of a ray that reacted to being touched {{with a camera}} by rubbing its back against the camera port, suggesting that it may actively <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> if disturbed. The Japanese sleeper ray adapts poorly to captivity. This and other species of electric rays are used in biomedical research because their electric organs have an abundance of ion channels and acetylcholine receptors, and {{can serve as a}} model for the human nervous system.|$|E

5|$|Cheetahs {{engage in}} several {{displays}} during fights, hunting, or self-defence. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah {{will hold its}} head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.|$|E
5|$|Generally nocturnal, {{the round}} ribbontail ray can be solitary or gregarious, {{and is an}} active {{predator}} of small, benthic molluscs, crustaceans, and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the embryos sustained by yolk, and later histotroph ("uterine milk") secreted by the mother; up to seven pups are born at a time. Although not aggressive, if provoked the round ribbontail ray will <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> with its venomous tail spine, {{and it has been}} responsible for at least one fatality. It is valued by ecotourist divers and recreational anglers. This slow-reproducing species is threatened by commercial fishing, both targeted and as bycatch, and habitat degradation across much of its range. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|Several {{apparently}} unprovoked {{attacks on}} humans {{have been attributed}} to the sicklefin lemon shark. Due to its formidable size and teeth, it is regarded as potentially dangerous, and certainly this species has been known to <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> quickly and vigorously if touched, speared, or otherwise provoked or alarmed. Once agitated, this shark can be a persistent adversary; in one case, a shark forced a swimmer to seek refuge atop a coral head, and circled for hours before giving up. However, observations by divers show that normally this shark is shy and hesitant to approach, even when presented with bait. Often, the shark will move away when a diver enters visual range. Young sharks are reportedly more aggressive and inquisitive than the adults. At Moorea, sicklefin lemon sharks are the main attraction of daily shark-feeding ecotourism dives. This shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquariums.|$|E
5|$|The First Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth {{took place}} in 1772 as {{the first of three}} {{partitions}} that ended the existence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1795. Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighbors—Austria, Russia and Prussia—so as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries. With Poland unable to effectively <b>defend</b> <b>itself,</b> and with foreign troops already inside the country, the Polish parliament (Sejm) ratified the partition in 1773 during the Partition Sejm convened by the three powers.|$|E
5|$|The Tasmanian {{numbfish}} is {{a fairly}} inactive species that spends {{long periods of time}} buried motionless in sediment. It feeds primarily on polychaete worms (particularly those of the family Maldanidae) and crustaceans (including amphipods, decapods, and tanaids). Nematodes and sipunculids may also be consumed on rare occasions. Juvenile rays consume polychaetes and crustaceans in roughly equal proportions, while adults consume mostly polychaetes. This dietary shift may reflect increasing experience with age, as polychaetes are burrowing animals and thus more difficult to locate and capture than crustaceans. Like other members of its family, the Tasmanian numbfish can <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> with a modest electric shock. Its predators include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). The tapeworm Anthobothrium hickmani is a parasite of this species.|$|E
