Roosevelt's {{influence}} waned as he approached the end of {{his second term}}, as his promise to forego a third term made him a lame duck and his concentration of power provoked a backlash from many Congressmen. He sought a national incorporation law (at a time when all corporations had state charters, which varied greatly state by state). He called for a federal income tax, but the Supreme Court in the 1890s had ruled any income tax would require a constitutional amendment. Roosevelt sought an inheritance tax so the great fortunes could not pay out in perpetuity. In the area of labor legislation, Roosevelt called for limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes; injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business. He wanted an <b>employee</b> <b>liability</b> law for industrial injuries (pre-empting state laws). He called for an eight-hour law for federal employees. In other areas he also sought a postal savings system (to provide competition for local banks), and he asked for campaign reform laws. He secured passage of the 1906 Hepburn Bill, with help from Democrats, which increased the regulating power of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Eventually some of his proposals were enacted under his successors. When Roosevelt ran for president on an independent Progressive Party ticket in 1912, in addition to these policies he proposed stringent new controls on the court system, especially state courts, to make them more democratic. His court policies in particular caused his anointed successor, William Howard Taft, to lead a counter-crusade that defeated Roosevelt in 1912.|$|E

40|$|The Clean Air Act (CAA) {{includes}} enforcement provisions {{by which}} violators of the Act {{can be held}} civilly liable for penalties. When federal agencies violate the CAA, however, the Constitution and the sovereign immunity doctrine serve as obstacles to civil enforcement. Federal agencies contend that the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s separation of powers doctrine, unitary executive theory, and 2 ̆ 2 case or controversy 2 ̆ 2 justiciability requirement bar the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from proceeding against them in civil enforcement actions. This Article addresses these arguments and examines the executive branch 2 ̆ 7 s approach to enforcing the Act against federal agencies. Federal agencies also have asserted the sovereign immunity doctrine as a defense to civil suits by states, local governments, and citizens. This doctrine protects the federal government from lawsuits unless Congress has explicitly waived sovereign immunity in a statute. While {{there is some evidence}} that Congress has intended to waive federal immunity in the CAA, federal courts have inconsistently applied such waivers. This Article examines the developing judicial applicability of the CAA 2 ̆ 7 s sovereign immunity waiver by comparing its language and legislative history to that of other environmental statutes.

Based upon an evaluation of the obstacles various entities face in bringing a civil suit against a federal agency or an agency 2 ̆ 7 s employee, this Article concludes that civil liability is not the optimal means of enforcing the Act and proposes an alternate method of gaining federal facility compliance.

The reason for my research {{is based on the}} fact that the importance of this issue is increasing driven by the fact that more people are employed with the multinational corporations. And there is an obvious trend to broadly interpreted, unilaterally extend and refine duties of the employees to such an extent that it is appropriate to raise a question, whether these approach is still in accordance with the law. Especially due to the fact, that such duties are often bound by sanctions in the form of claiming damages or even termination of the employment by notice. While the Labour Code in its general provisions clearly states that the adjustment of the employee's duties may only be stipulated as a result of bilateral legal negotiations. The thesis is composed of nine chapters, some of which are further internally divided into sub- chapters.
