60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> away. Louise {{watched him}} with very real interest.|$|E
60|$|Without {{speaking}} to her, without {{even looking at}} her, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> back to the cottage.|$|E
60|$|He stood {{facing her}} for a moment without movement. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> slowly out of the house.|$|E
60|$|Alf {{winked at}} 'im, {{but the old}} man drew hisself up and stared at 'im, <b>and</b> then <b>'e</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> away with his 'ead in the air.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> did <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> back to London with a trusting heart.|$|R
60|$|So saying, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> away, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> off fast {{after the}} cow.|$|R
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> {{slowly up}} the path. He had taken perhaps a dozen steps {{when she called}} him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> {{sharply to}} the corner of the Terrace, finding himself almost {{immediately}} {{face to face with a}} policeman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, {{without another}} word, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> away; and nothing further passed between us until in the afternoon, when you so {{suddenly}} arrived." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> away, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> {{with long}} {{swinging}} steps {{back to the}} hotel.|$|R
50|$|At {{a nearby}} newsstand, another man {{witnesses}} the arrest. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> away - with a limp. He is the gunman, {{and his name}} is Sergeant Sommai. After losing a leg fighting for the Thai Special Forces during the Secret War in Laos, Sommai {{now works as a}} barber in a small shop in a canal community of suburban Bangkok.|$|R
60|$|He {{stood for}} a moment shaking his 'ead at them, and then, still holding it very 'igh, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> out.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> away. They {{had gone}} {{but a few}} paces when, in the distance, the report of a pistol was heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "He can't {{have too}} many to please me," [...] Teddy replied, boldly; and then, to Carrots's surprise, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> {{directly}} toward the enemy.|$|E
60|$|Again {{there was}} a silence, and, as she made no answer, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> towards the door, leaving her still staring into the bowl.|$|E
60|$|John {{allowed his}} eyes to follow his brother till his shape could not be seen, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> again <b>walked</b> up <b>and</b> down.|$|R
60|$|Again {{that smile}} swept across Murgh's awful face though that smile was cold as the winter dawn. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> slowly <b>walked</b> away toward the west.|$|R
50|$|In the melee, Jack escapes {{and runs}} {{for his life}} {{through the streets of}} Dublin. He runs to Isabelle. He asks for her help, then passes out. Dawn. Isabelle pulls into a lay-by {{overlooking}} the city. Jack gets out, dazed and confused, he doesn’t know where he is, what’s happening. He looks at the city shimmering below him. He looks at Isabelle. He looks back at the city. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> towards Isabelle. <b>He</b> gets back into her car. They drive west, away from the city.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said James. [...] "Here, {{take this}} thing off, I'm hot." [...] They unwound the shawl. <b>He</b> <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> firmly to the dining-room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-by," [...] he said, and {{his voice}} choked. When <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> away Washington was very far away indeed and {{political}} honors cheap as dust.|$|E
6000|$|... "You need have no fear," [...] said Clearemout with {{a bitter}} smile, as <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> away, {{followed}} by a groan from the whole party.|$|E
2500|$|Marwood {{prepares to}} leave for the station, turning down Withnail's request for one last drink. In Regent's Park in the rain, Marwood confesses that he will miss Withnail, but does not allow him to {{accompany}} him further to the station. Bottle of wine in hand, Withnail declaims [...] "What a piece of work is a man!" [...] from Hamlet to an uncomprehending pack of wolves behind a fence in the London Zoo. The camera watches as <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> away into the gloomy distance, swinging the bottle, as the credits start to roll.|$|R
60|$|Steiner {{stared at}} Ralph. Then, {{thinking}} {{he had spent}} enough time on such a poor lad as the bridge tender, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> away <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> off, whistling a merry concert-hall air.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish the}} farmer {{would let me}} give him a bone," [...] said he to himself; <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> away, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> slowly around to the barn, to fodder the cattle.|$|R
60|$|And then, {{without waiting}} for an answer, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> to his litter, and in ten minutes from that time we were all well under way.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's this one," [...] said he. [...] "The {{people on}} wheels keep to it." [...] With this <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> slowly towards {{the back of}} the house.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Walters {{looked at}} him, {{looked at the}} {{polished}} nickel taps, and the neat row of mugs on the shelves. Then, without a word, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> out.|$|E
60|$|She {{pushed him}} away and walking up to the box-office put down her money. Philip had threepence in his pocket. He could not follow. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> away <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> slowly down Oxford Street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you took}} {{them away from}} me, at any rate," [...] said Hilbert; <b>and</b> saying this, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> away <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> off, {{seemingly}} very angry. He was going to complain to his father.|$|R
60|$|This {{question}} was called forth in {{consequence of the}} red man rising quietly and throwing his gun on his shoulder. Instead of replying, however, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> abruptly <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> off into the woods.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> out. In {{the hall}} he passed Lord Nunneley. [...] "We have {{arranged}} it {{according to your}} wish, sir," [...] he said, [...] "your daughter and I." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> aft to the wheel. I {{went forward}} {{and took my}} station at the jibs. Another whisper of wind, and another, passed by. The canvas flapped lazily.|$|E
60|$|Then {{without another}} word <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> back to the soldiers, who {{received}} him with shouts of laughter. Evidently Imbozwi was not a popular character, and his discomfiture delighted them.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{held his}} 'ead up very 'igh, and, arter {{looking at them}} as if they was dirt, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> off with his nose in the air to spend the evening by 'imself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> off, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> hastily away. I {{could see}} that he had spoken with difficulty, and that, in spite of his efforts to appear {{composed}} and tranquil, his mouth was twitching, and his eyes moist.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> {{started to}} <b>walk</b> away. The other {{stood for a}} moment, staring; then crossed the road.|$|R
