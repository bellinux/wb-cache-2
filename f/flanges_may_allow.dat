50|$|It is also {{possible}} to form air-tight seal between a pair of otherwise unpressurizable flanges using a flat gasket made out of a special electrically conductive elastomer.

50|$|A hub is {{the center}} part of a bicycle wheel. It {{consists}} of an axle, bearings and a hub shell. The hub shell typically has two machined metal flanges to which spokes can be attached. Hub shells can be one-piece with press-in cartridge or free bearings or, {{in the case of}} older designs, the <b>flanges</b> <b>may</b> be affixed to a separate hub shell.|$|R
50|$|The <b>flange</b> <b>may</b> be {{serrated}} {{to provide}} a locking action. The serrations are angled such that they keep the nut from rotating in the direction that would loosen the nut. Because of the serrations they cannot be used with a washer or on surfaces that must not be scratched. The serrations help in preventing the vibration of the nut from moving the fastener, thus maintaining the holding power of nut.|$|R

This pes {{is referred to}} the genus Linhenykus {{and is one of}} the first foot skeletons to be described for a derived alvarezsaur, providing new information on the first digit of the pes. The evolution of a laterally directed flange of the anterior face of the distal third metatarsal in arctometatarsalian taxa is described and discussed. This <b>flange</b> <b>may</b> have increased stability of the foot during cursorial locomotion and may also provide useful taxonomic and systematic data...|$|R
50|$|Duct connections: {{section to}} section.Ducts are shipped from {{fabricating}} facility to job sits on trucks, by rail, or on barges in lengths accommodating {{the mode of}} transport, often in 20 foot sections. These sections are connected with flanges, or weld straps. Flanges are provided at expansion joints, or to join low stress duct sections. <b>Flanges</b> <b>may</b> be difficult to design for the duct plate forces. Also flange gaskets add flexibility to the flanges that makes their ability to carry forces problematic. therefore weld straps (a short steel strap) are commonly used for higher stress duct plate connections.|$|R
2500|$|In a few {{models of}} scuba {{regulator}} the mouthpiece {{also has an}} outer rubber flange that fits outside the lips and extends into two straps that fasten together behind the neck. This helps to keep the mouthpiece in place if the user's jaws go slack through unconsciousness or distraction. The mouthpiece safety <b>flange</b> <b>may</b> also be a separate component. The attached neck strap also allows the diver to keep the regulator hanging under the chin where it is protected and ready for use. Recent mouthpieces do not usually include an external flange, but the practice of using a neck strap has been revived by technical divers who use a bungee or surgical rubber [...] "necklace" [...] which can come off the mouthpiece without damage if pulled firmly.|$|R
30|$|According to the {{different}} features of the deformation area, the deformation area is divided into five regions named A, B, C, D and E, as shown in Figure  8. Because no deformation occurs on the cylinder wall, all stresses are zero on region E. The {{outer edge of the}} flange (Region A) shows tensile tangential stress and compressive radial stress. The middle region of the flange (Region B) shows tensile tangential stress and radial stress, and the round corner (Region C) shows tensile tangential stress and compressive radial stress. The inner edge (Region D) shows compressive tangential stress and radial stress. It can be known that the inner edge of the <b>flange</b> <b>may</b> incur wrinkling because of the tangential compressive stress and radial compressive stress. Additionally, bulges can appear in the round corner because of the compressive radial stress.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{affiliates}} {{a new trend}} that could be applicable in light industrial steel buildings. In that regard, {{the possibility of using}} built-up cold-formed steel columns composed of two lipped channels inter-connected using a series of batten plates is introduced. The ultimate capacity of axially-loaded cold-formed channels with partially stiffened <b>flanges</b> <b>may</b> be adversely affected by torsional flange buckling. A numerical finite element procedure is used to investigate the effect of various parameters on the behavior of a battened column built up from two back-to-back cold-formed lipped channels. The parametric study accounted for different cross sectional shapes, column slenderness ratios, as well as initial imperfections. Large deflection analysis along with elasto-plastic material response have been integrated in the proposed model. In addition, a formula that integrates torsional flange buckling into the unified effective width approach i...|$|R
5000|$|Wheels {{that are}} not {{required}} to transfer any significant amount of torque from the hub to the rim are often laced radially. Here, the spokes leave the hub at perpendicular to the axle and go straight to the rim, without crossing any other spokes - e.g., [...] "cross-0". This lacing pattern can not transfer torque as efficiently as tangential lacing. Thus it is generally preferred to build a crossed-spoke wheel where braking and drive forces are present. Hubs that have previously been laced in any other pattern should not be used for radial lacing, as the pits and dents created by the spokes can be the weak points along which the hub <b>flange</b> <b>may</b> break. This is not always the case: for example if the hub used has harder, steel flanges like those on a vintage bicycle.|$|R

5000|$|The {{dishes on}} each side of a wheel are not always equal. The cogset (freewheel or cassette) of a rear wheel and disc brake rotors, if installed, takes up width on the hub, and so the <b>flanges</b> <b>may</b> not be located symmetrically about the center plane of the hub or the bike. Since the rim must be centered, but the hub flanges are not, there is a {{difference}} in dish between the two sides. Such an asymmetrical wheel is called a [...] "dished" [...] wheel. The side of the wheel with less dish has slightly shorter but significantly higher-tensioned spokes than the side with more dish. Several different techniques have been tried to minimize this spoke asymmetry. In addition to modified hub geometry, some rims have off-center spoke holes, and the mounting of common J-bend spokes at the hub flange can be altered [...] "inboard" [...] or [...] "outboard".|$|R
40|$|A 3 -year-old Holstein cow was {{referred}} to Cornell for a primary complaint of colic and distended loops of small intestine palpated per rectum. During physical examination, the cow exhibited signs of colic. She was hypothermic and dehydrated with cool distal extremities. A transient ping was present {{on the right side}} consistent with gas and fluid filled-small intestine. Rumen contractions and gut sounds were decreased. Rectal and ultrasound examination revealed dilated loops of small intestine. During surgery, a volvulus of the distal <b>flange</b> <b>may</b> have been created during manipulation and exteriorization of the intestines. This displacement was corrected and the cow was recovered, but died the next morning. Necropsy findings included sepsis and diffuse necrohemorrhagic enteritis. The fairly healthy appearance of the bowel at surgery and the diffuse distribution of the necrohemorrhagic enteritis suggest this cow’s primary problem may have been jejunal hemorrhage syndrome, and not a volvulus of the distal flange...|$|R
40|$|Fenerivia species (Annonaceae) are {{characterized}} by a prominent flange immediately below the perianth, which has been interpreted as synapomorphic for the genus. The homology of this flange is controversial: previous studies of Fenerivia heteropetala (an aberrant species, with 12 perianth parts in three whorls) {{have suggested that the}} <b>flange</b> <b>may</b> represent a vestigial calyx resulting from a disruption to the homeotic control of organ identity during floral development. Comparative data on floral vasculature in Fenerivia capuronii are presented to elucidate the homology of the flange in other Fenerivia species (which possess nine perianth parts in three whorls, typical of most Annonaceae). The flange in F. capuronii differs from that in F.  heteropetala as it is unvascularized. It is nevertheless suggested that the flange is likely to be homologous, and that a homeotic mutation in the F. heteropetala lineage resulted in the formation of a vestigial but vascularized calyx that fused with the otherwise unvascularized flange...|$|R
