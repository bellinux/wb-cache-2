Having grown weary of the subject, she snaps at him that he should <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> or stop talking. Toby accordingly goes to the local prison to talk to the person convicted of being the notorious local murderer and tell him he believes he is innocent. Offscreen, the convict begins strangling Toby for his part in the conviction. However, Toby does have his spirits lifted after Nellie gives him a lift from the hospital and commends him for his bravery.|$|E
5|$|Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer {{discuss the}} {{situation}} and Kramer urges Jerry to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but Elaine argues that Rava will no longer let her edit her book if Jerry does this. Jerry calls Ray and has lunch with him, while George sits in the next booth and eavesdrops on their conversation. Jerry and George asks him about the statue, but Ray gets offended and leaves when he hears their opinion. Elaine and Rava get into an argument about Jerry's accusation, and Elaine is no longer allowed to edit Rava's book. Without notifying anybody, Kramer dresses up in Irving's old clothes and goes to Ray's apartment, {{pretending to be a}} cop, and recovers the statue, despite Ray's protests. Kramer returns the statue to a grateful George. But while George is holding the statue, Kramer gives him a friendly pat on the back, causing George to drop the statue, which breaks when it hits the floor. The episode ends without ever revealing whether or not Ray had in fact stolen the statue from Jerry's apartment.|$|E
5|$|Sol and Naz {{spend the}} night {{together}} but at later dance rehearsals, Asher gives Naz her necklace back, and Sol sees this. He confronts Naz about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. Sol punches Asher, saying his brother has betrayed him, and a fight breaks out, but is broken up by Skolla and the other dancers. Skolla tells Sol and Asher they are both out {{of the group and}} reveals that Asher bought Sol's place. Sol goes back home to his mother but a neighbour tells him she has been taken away. Back in Walford, Naz insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. Stevie attempts to get them to reconcile by locking them in the flat and pretending to swallow the key, but Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol says she can stay there. Sol and Naz get close again but Asher interrupts them when he returns drunk. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. Asher finds Sol with their mother in hospital, and tells Sol he is better off with him than their mother as she is schizophrenic and has stabbed Asher. Sol says Asher is the problem and leaves. Asher finds him and apologises for Naz and says she did not get Sol's text message because he deleted it, and tells Sol that Naz loves him and he should <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Sol returns to Walford again as Naz is leaving, and stops Ekin's car. Naz gets out and they kiss. Asher tells him he can dance at the dance-off, but when his name is called, he is unsure and calls for Asher, saying he needs him. Asher tells him he can do it on his own. Everyone cheers him after his routine and he is called one of the best dancers.|$|E

Parker made attempts to have it stopped, but failed to do so. According to Presley's friend, Larry Geller, Parker secretly wanted the book to be published, hoping that it would open Presley's eyes to how bad he had gotten and persuade him to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The book would eventually be published in August 1977, two weeks before Presley's death.|$|E

They {{suspected}} Anti-Treaty forces (who had recently seized the Four Courts in Dublin) might be responsible – this was in fact not the case – and thought the Irish Provisional Government “should be pressed to deal with the matter”. Macready was summoned to London, where he found the Cabinet worried about their personal safety but also keen for a dramatic gesture of retaliation, and was asked whether it was possible for British troops to seize the Four Courts – he said that it was but cautioned against precipitate action which might reunite the two Irish factions, and on his return to Dublin deliberately delayed taking such action.

Apple's suit alleged 20 separate patent infringements relating to the iPhone's user interface, underlying architecture and hardware. Steve Jobs exclaimed [...] "We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions, or we can <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> We've decided to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> ... think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours". The ITC rejected {{all but one of}} Apple's claims, however, ruling for Apple on a single claim relating to data tapping. HTC motioned the Delaware court for a change of venue to the Northern District of California, arguing against Apple's desire to consolidate the case with the similar cases brought by Nokia against Apple, alleging insubstantial overlap between those cases and Apple's complaint, but Judge Gregory M. Sleet denied HTC's motion for a venue change, ruling that Apple's choice of forum would prevail. HTC countersued Apple in September 2011 in the same court claiming infringement of four patents HTC obtained from Google, also filing a counter-complaint with the ITC, with HTC's general counsel saying [...] "HTC will continue to protect its patented inventions against infringement from Apple until such infringement stops." [...] In May 2012 the Delaware court ordered mediation between the companies. In November 2012, HTC and Apple ended the patent dispute by settling the case, but did not disclose the terms of the settlement. The companies reported the settlement included a 10-year agreement for licensing both companies' current and future patents to each other." ...|$|E

If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough."
