2500|$|Wallace {{admitted}} {{she was nervous}} about reprising the role of Kat. Speaking to TVTimes, Wallace said she'd feared she forgot how to play Kat. She commented: [...] "I missed playing Kat," [...] she said. [...] "Now it feels like I've come home. I was nervous at first because I thought I might have forgotten how to play her, {{but as soon as}} <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> onto the Square she came back to me. Even when I was out of the show, people called me Kat every day in the street. I was flattered and now I'm having a great time. The recent scripts have been brilliant." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E

40|$|My work {{is mostly}} improvisational. When <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> {{and look at}} what I’ve made, it’s not until that moment that I know what the piece means. I am {{at a loss for words}} to express how I am {{impacted}} by each of my creations. Every individual will draw their own conclusions when they see my sculptures for the first time...|$|R
40|$|The M 3 -Competition {{continues}} {{to improve the}} design of forecasting competitions: It examines more series than any previous competition, improves error analyses and includes commercial forecasting programs as competitors. To judge where to go from here, <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> {{to look at the}} M-Competitions as a whole. I discuss the advantages of the M-Competitions in hopes that they will be retained, describe how to gain additional benefit from future competitions, and finally, describe a low-cost approach to competitions...|$|R
60|$|He {{sprang up}} at the same moment. All the suspicions I had ever heard whispered against his sanity flashed over my mind in an instant, and <b>I</b> involuntarily <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> a pace or two.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> {{into the}} little hall. They were talking {{together}} earnestly. Arthur looked up and glared at me.|$|E
60|$|In my turn, <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back.</b> But {{in making}} the action, I {{detected}} in his eyes some latent fear of me. This put the monstrous thought to flight.|$|E
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. This is outrageous. When I {{tried to}} {{step off the}} pier on to the road, I {{received}} a shock, followed by an attack of pins and needles which ceased only when <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> on to the stones.|$|E
40|$|Several of this Conference's {{baseline}} scenarios involve NEOs, with specified physical characteristics, {{predicted to}} strike Earth at a specified future time. They offer opportunities for aerospace engineers to design successful deflection missions to very specific constraints. These scenarios {{serve as the}} foundation for some of this conference's papers. Here <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> and examine a broader range of implications of these scenarios; I also describe some different, but plausible or even much more likely, scenarios that astronomers, engineers, policy makers, and public officials should be prepared to deal with. The impact hazard so far has been essentially theoretical, with no consequential physical impact...|$|R
5000|$|Cambridge's number five, Catherine Foot, remarked [...] "After training, <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> {{and think}} 'wow, I'm {{part of this}} {{incredible}} tradition'. There is nothing else I'd rather be doing than training for this event", while Oxford's stroke Amber de Vere said [...] "All the training has been leading up to this weekend. Next year is definitely exciting and it has added something to training, but as a crew, we're only thinking about Sunday." [...] This year's race was umpired by Judith Packer and was sponsored by Newton Investment Management, a subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon, for the third successive year.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{bowed and}} <b>stepped</b> <b>back,</b> motioning to the lacquey {{to take the}} fellow away, much as I should have motioned him to remove some uncleanness from before me.|$|R
6000|$|Mark {{the nature}} of the human soul! I had begun with awe, not to say terror, for this was my first {{experience}} of such things. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> from the banks of the Riverside Geyser, saying:--"Pooh! Is that all it can do?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{waited until}} Gabriel, with a last frightened glance at me, {{had passed through}} the gap, {{and then he turned}} upon me with an {{expression}} so murderous that <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> a pace or two, and tightened my grasp upon my oak stick.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take care, Saint-Eustache," [...] I {{said very}} quietly, my {{eyes fixed on}} his. And much as dead Caesar's ghost may have {{threatened}} Brutus with Philippi [...] "We meet at Toulouse, Chevalier," [...] said I, and closing the carriage door <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> made a <b>step</b> <b>back,</b> {{gathered}} myself together, and leapt {{with all}} my might. I seemed to shoot right {{up in the air}} as though I should never come down.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> {{bowed and}} <b>stepped</b> <b>back,</b> but the driver did not start. He {{sat for a}} moment irresolute, and then, turning toward Mother Anastasia, asked, [...] "Shall I wait for the other sister?" ...|$|R
60|$|From {{the wounded}} man's bedside <b>I</b> wended my <b>steps</b> <b>back</b> to the Rue St. Antoine, {{resolved}} to start for Blois that very night; and beside me walked Montrésor, with bent head, {{like a man}} deep in thought.|$|R
6000|$|He {{caught at}} the word. [...] "The old dodging Devil," [...] he screamed piercingly {{and burst into}} such a loud laugh as I had never heard before. It was a provoking, mocking peal, with a hair-raising, {{screeching}} over-note of defiance. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back,</b> utterly confounded.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a pretty}} group in a pretty setting, and I thrilled with {{professional}} pride as <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> for a final, knowing squint at it all. Then I went to my camera, slipped in the plate, gave them due warning and took off the cap.|$|E
60|$|I {{had shown}} myself thick-headed many a time before; but never so dull as now when I would have begun {{pulling out the}} rubbish without means of hiding it, and <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> in despair, not {{understanding}} how we might {{at the same time}} remove and keep it hidden from view.|$|E
5000|$|I was in England again—in London, {{and walking}} along Piccadilly with little Pip—when a servant came running after {{me to ask}} would <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> to a lady in a {{carriage}} who wished to speak to me. It was a little pony carriage, which the lady was driving; and the lady and I looked sadly enough on one another."I am greatly changed, I know; but I thought {{you would like to}} shake hands with Estella, too, Pip. Lift up that pretty child and let me kiss it!" [...] (She supposed the child, I think, to be my child.)I was very glad afterwards to have had the interview; for, in her face and in her voice, and in her touch, she gave me the assurance, that suffering had been stronger than Miss Havisham's teaching, and had given her a heart to understand what my heart used to be.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2008 Graves {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} return to The Misfits if asked. [...] "Jerry and I do not have a dysfunctional working relationship. Him and I both know and I know he knows that I am on board. It is a phone call away. <b>I</b> won't <b>step</b> <b>back</b> into what <b>I</b> walked away from, but the problem isn't with Jerry and I. The problem is with Doyle and with Chud." ...|$|R
60|$|She spoke no {{answering}} word, but silently {{held out}} her hand. Silently I took it in mine, {{and for a moment}} I hesitated, thinking of what I was--of what she was. At last, moved by some power that was greater than my will, I stooped and pressed those shapely fingers to my lips. Then <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> suddenly <b>back</b> and closed the carriage door, oppressed by a feeling akin to that of having done an evil deed.|$|R
60|$|It {{was then}} that Lakor quickly unslung a belt from his harness, and as <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> to parry a wicked thrust he lashed one end of it about my left ankle so that it wound there for an instant, while he jerked {{suddenly}} upon the other end, throwing me heavily upon my back.|$|E
6000|$|The American waved in the {{air with}} his knotted fists. [...] "You think that I am crazed," [...] he cried, [...] "and, by the eternal, you are enough to make me so! When I say that I sent the bishop, I mean that I saw to the job. You {{remember}} when <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> to your friend the major?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back,</b> {{separating}} from her, {{and replaced}} {{the knife in}} its sheath. I looked at Wolf Larsen. He still pressed his left hand against his forehead. It covered his eyes. His head was bowed. He seemed to have grown limp. His body was sagging at the hips, his great shoulders were drooping and shrinking forward.|$|E
5000|$|In February, 2012 it was {{announced}} that creator Alan Ball would be stepping down as showrunner {{at the end of the}} fifth season. Ball will continue on as executive producer in a more advisory role and leave the day-to-day production of the series to others. [...] "Because of the fantastic cast, writers, producers and crew, with whom I have been lucky enough to work these past five years, I know <b>I</b> could <b>step</b> <b>back</b> and the show will continue to thrive," [...] said Ball in a statement.|$|R
40|$|The M 3 -Competition {{continues}} {{to improve the}} design of forecasting competitions: It examines more series than any previous competition, improves error analyses. and includes commercial forecasting programs as competitors. To judge where to go from here, <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> {{to look at the}} M-Competitions as a whole. I discuss the advantages of the M-Competitions in hopes that they will be retained, describe how to gain additional benefit from future competitions, and finally, describe a low-cost approach to competitions. 1. Favorable design aspects of the M-Competitions The M-Competitions provide a model for conducting scientific research. They employ at least five key aspects: empirical testing, multiple hypotheses, large samples, independent validation, and full disclosure. While these aspects might seem obvious, studies in management science seldom include all of them. 1. 1. Empirical testing Empirical testing is necessary to test forecasting methods. Despite the resistance of timeseries researchers (Fildes & Makridakis, 1995), interest in empirical studies has been growing among forecasters. Forecasting journals now publish many empirical comparisons. The M-Competitions have led the way in such comparisons. 1. 2. Multiple hypothese...|$|R

Many biodiversity researchers {{have responded to the}} financial constraints faced by policy makers to develop models based upon the “Noah’s Ark ” metaphor, implying that society can save only a limited amount of biodiversity. Unfortunately, as Herman Daly (Land Economics, 1991) pointed out, such microeconomic rules can allow an ark to sink albeit in some optimal fashion. So, <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> to look at the macroeconomic question, how big should the ark be? I start with Norgaard’s (Ecological Economics, 2010) framework, which is based upon the concept of a production possibility frontier combined with a sustainability criterion. I develop a model from that starting point by shifting to an isoquant framework while maintaining the strong sustainability criterion. I demonstrate how this model allows for identifying and addressing the key biodiversity protection policy criteria at the macroeconomic level. One key conclusion from this modeling is that Daly’s analysis remains remarkably prescient...|$|R
6000|$|I {{saw there}} was no time to lose. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> a little from the tall savage, who was {{breathing}} like a hot-air engine in front of me, and made my explanations to the company. I told the tale of [...] "Rudder Grange," [...] and showed them how it was like to a stationary wash-tub--at certain stages of the tide.|$|E
60|$|He {{seemed about}} to say something, but changed his mind. He left me without another word. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> into the sitting-room. My father, with an empty tumbler in his hand, was {{crouched}} forward over the table, breathing heavily. My stepmother, with marble 'face and hard set eyes, was leaning forward in her chair, looking into the dying fire. She scarcely glanced at me as I entered.|$|E
60|$|As if repulsing {{the very}} {{sound of the}} name, the Padrone made that ample, sweeping, knocking-down gesture. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> a pace {{and stared at him}} fearfully. His open shirt {{uncovered}} his muscular neck and the thick hair on his chest. He planted the oar upright in the soft soil, and rolling up slowly his right sleeve, extended the bare arm before my face.|$|E
40|$|The {{films that}} I make are part documentary, part film essay, part visual poem. They are created {{out of a}} series of up to 30 {{drawings}} that are animated. The process from research to completion takes about 2 years, {{and at the end of}} it there is a film and a number of drawings that can be exhibited. This paper emerges out of the realisation that in the different stages of making a drawing and a film—from planning a drawing and seeking an image as a starting point through to the finished film being projected onto a screen in a gallery—I am looking at the image in different ways. There is a close-up kind of looking when I am drawing and a reflective kind of looking when <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> to take stock. There is a way of looking at darks and lights as they are built up that is different from the way of looking at the lines crossing the edges of the grid being used to transfer an image to the drawing paper. Seeing the drawings on the wall of my studio is different from seeing the same drawings in a museum setting...|$|R
60|$|Faintly {{out of the}} frosty air was wafted the knelling of midnight. <b>I</b> rose, <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> {{from the}} firelight, drew the curtain, and stole a look into space. Away on the right flashed Sirius, and to east of him came gliding flat-headed Hydra with Alphard, the Red Bird, in his coil. So, {{for a moment in}} our history, I and the {{terrestrial}} globe were alone together. It seemed indeed that an intenser silence drew over reality as the earth faced yet one more fleeting revolution round her invisible lord and master. But no moon was risen yet.|$|R
40|$|When {{you cross}} a street, {{and there is}} a car {{charging}} towards you, there is always this dilemma: do <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> or do <b>I</b> continue crossing? The actual choice is of course yours, but as any good student of social anthropology would tell you, what is the sensible strategy depends on the prevailing culture and social norms of the particular crossing. If you are in Italy, you should better <b>step</b> <b>back</b> and wait. If you are in Germany, you wouldn’t even have entered the road. If you are in Greece, {{all you have to do}} is ensure that you don’t visibly make eye-contact with the driver: if you do, her reaction will be something like “well, he saw me, so he’d better get his bum off the road”; if you don’t, then she is more likely to think along the lines of “has he seen me? I’d better slow down – I don’t want to have to pay for that idiot”. Instead, if you are in the UK, establishing eye-contact is all you need to do: doing so, makes the driver think “that bloody pedestrian, he saw me but still wants to cross; I have to slow down”; failing to do so invites the driver to a challenge: “it is inappropriate to be crossing a road without checking the traffic first; I think I should accelerate, if anything, simply to make a point”...|$|R
