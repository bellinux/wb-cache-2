30|$|Thus {{for some}} twenty years Nokia had enjoyed being the undisputed global market leader in mobile handsets. It is, nevertheless, {{the view of}} {{industry}} experts like Jon Andersson (2011) that this situation ended with the arrival {{on the market in}} 2007 of Apple’s smartphone – iPhone, iPod and related <b>iTune</b> platform for music and applications (‘apps’) of all kinds. Apple and Google’s (Android) mobile platforms nowadays attract a global network of developers the main focus of whose innovation is the creation of new applications (‘apps’). In addition, as chips for mobile handsets became more and more powerful the mobile handset changed from a mobile phone to a mini computer with increasing possibilities for software applications ranging from banking to gaming and city maps. This explains why the physical mobile handset is today the least important part of a mobile phone and where the least added value accrues. Nokia got locked-in to an operating system – Symbian - that was once state of the art and retains robust functionality but lacks the flexibility for convergence of the kind exploited by Apple and Google Android. It acquired this Cambridge (UK)-based consortium operating system in 1999 which reinforced Nokia’s telephony-led path dependence. Nokia’s early successes were closely integrated with the activities of Finland’s TIS, led by innovation and research agencies Tekes and VTT but its spectacular growth led it to undervalue its TIS, both nationally and regionally, where managers of innovation agencies, at the outset attractive co-creation partners, were sacrificed for the most important corporate customers.|$|E

By measuring participants' values, measuring their affective forecasts regarding a hypothetical extrinsic or intrinsic experience and then providing them with the experience, this study allowed for the testing of a number of different hypotheses: (1) that a typical intrinsic experience (e. g., giving to another) will tend to boost happiness more than an equivalent extrinsic experience (e. g., getting something comparable for oneself), and (2) that people in general will forecast that getting something for themselves will make them happier than giving something comparable to someone else, (3) that relatively more extrinsic (high-REVO) people will be more likely than less extrinsic (low-REVO) people to forecast that getting something for themselves will make them happier than giving something comparable to someone else, and (4) that high-REVO people will be more likely than low-REVO people to overestimate the benefits of getting something themselves relative to giving something to someone else.

40|$|SciNote is {{a nonprofit}} company {{providing}} a unique software platform for nonprofit scientific research institutions and {{higher education in the}} greater Midwest area. The company will form partnerships with local universities and institutions. SciNote's goal is to provide an integrated system for scientists to stay up-to-date with knowledge, share expert evaluations of knowledge and sustain the accumulation of knowledge. SciNote hopes, in the future, that scientific research process can be much faster, productive and rewarding; and with that hope, we are aiming to become a nation-wide leader and first in place to provide such service to advance scientific discoveries. Stay up-to-date to fast refreshing literatures everyday is a daunting task. Without knowing what the unknown is makes it impossible for anyone to know where to explore for the undiscovered. On the other hand, every great discovery is a manifestation of what we've already known. When faced with the old and the new, scientists often resort to expert opinions (e. g., published reviews) as to where the next gold mine of discovery is. Independent researchers such as academic faculties are used to isolated knowledge pools that they kept building along the period of careers. When it comes to find an advancing opportunity in their career, attending professional conferences and colleague collaborations are often used to help generate the inspirations for the next move. In addition to the challenge to make the main focus of the research alive, as a typical research laboratory grows, constant personnel changes and project alterations make heritable knowledge base almost impossible. The interdisciplinary nature of modern day research brings in yet another challenge: how to build a common ground for scientists with various focus areas? This common ground, by an ideal definition, should be a merge of the best expertise and the best interest. Creativity in discovery needs to be fostered in an environment with celebration of diversity, crystallized ideas, and enthusiasm. To succeed in interdisciplinary research must start with sharing of the minds. Only when minds are synced can resources and personnel be utilized to its maximum strength. With the above-mentioned hurdles and challenge in our mission, SciNote can revolutionize how science was done with open source software that is user account based and Internet accessible. Think of the SciNote platform as “An <b>iTune</b> for science with 'Ping'. ” What SciNote will provide is a truly live-feed knowledge-sharing device fully utilizes the cyber-speed and security feature of the Internet and software engineering. Sharing the knowledge will be as simple as a star ranking, or a comment message; sharing the initiatives will be as easy as a discussion topic, or an electronic invitation; and sharing the resource will be as intuitive as one click, or one download. SciNote is in direct contact with day-to-day operation of a laboratory, an interdisciplinary center, or a research university. It is projected that within two years, 50 % of the scientists in the covering area use our system as routine as they use Microsoft office. Over time, SciNote will become the first and pioneering software service provider in revolutionize scientific discovery pipeline. The impact for scientific discovery and research funding generation will be immense. With close collaboration with both cutting edge software engineers and research institutions, SciNote is hope to become THE platform for science knowledge sharing and the only nonprofit company that is prestigiously recognized in a global scale.
