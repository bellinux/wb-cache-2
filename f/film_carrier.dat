25|$|The {{double-sided}} metallized film is electrostatically field-free {{because the}} electrodes {{have the same}} voltage potential {{on both sides of}} the film, and therefore does not contribute to the total capacitance of the capacitor. This film can therefore be made of a different and less expensive material. For example, a polypropylene film capacitor with double-sided metallization on a polyester <b>film</b> <b>carrier</b> makes the capacitor not only cheaper but also smaller, because the thinner polyester foil improves the volumetric efficiency of the capacitor. Film capacitors with a double-sided metallized film effectively have thicker electrodes for higher surge current handling, but still do retain their self-healing properties, in contrast to the film/foil capacitors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Tantalum-doped indium {{tin oxide}} films were {{deposited}} on glass substrate by co-sputtering with two-targets. Tantalum-doping strengthened {{the orientation of the}} (400) plane and resulted in better crystalline structure, larger grain size and lower surface roughness. Due to the better crystallizability of the tantalum-doping <b>films,</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration and the mobility were increased. Tantalum-doping revealed better optical–electrical properties. The environmental effects on electrical properties stability and long-term reliability of tantalum-doped films in NaCl, Na 2 SO 4 and HCl solutions at 25 °C were also investigated, which simulated corrosion behavior in marine, industrial and acidic environments. The relative resistance change (△R/R) for tantalum-doped films revealed that the films had the best electrical properties stability and long-term reliability in these aggressive environments. The pre-formation of a protective oxide layer {{on the surface of the}} films had an enhancing effect on the corrosion properties...|$|R
