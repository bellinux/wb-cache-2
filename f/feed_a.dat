5|$|Predatory wasp species {{normally}} subdue {{their prey}} by stinging it, and then either {{lay their eggs}} on it, leaving it in place, or carry it back to their nest where an egg may be laid on the prey item and the nest sealed, or several smaller prey items may be deposited to <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> single developing larva. Apart from providing food for their offspring, no further maternal care is given. Members of the family Chrysididae, the cuckoo wasps, are kleptoparasites and lay their eggs in the nests of unrelated host species.|$|E
5|$|Radau {{returns to}} food, {{describing}} sago and the breadfruit tree. The breadfruit tastes like Yorkshire pudding or mashed potato; with meat {{it is the}} best of vegetables; with sugar, milk, butter or molasses, it is a delicious pudding with a special flavour; Radau hopes that perhaps it will one day be found in European markets. As for the sago palm, one tree yields 1,800 cakes, enough to <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> man for a year.|$|E
5|$|Radyr Woods {{provides}} habitats for a {{wide range}} of species. It also has a number of natural springs that <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> duck pond and a kingfisher pond. Recent housing developments between the reserve and the railway line have added complementary public open space with picnic areas and a children's play area. Since 1986 all maintenance and development of the reserve has been carried out by a volunteer group known as The Friends of Radyr Woods.|$|E
40|$|Savannah River Laboratory (SRL) {{is testing}} the slurry <b>feeding</b> of <b>a</b> ceramic melter as a {{possible}} method to vitrify its high-level radioactive waste. <b>Feeding</b> <b>a</b> liquid slurry requires simpler and less expensive equipment than <b>feeding</b> <b>a</b> powdered calcine. Experiments have progressed from manual <b>feeding,</b> to <b>a</b> semiautomatic system, to the present slurry-feed system, which is completely automatic. All experiments to date indicate that slurry <b>feeding</b> is <b>a</b> promising way of vitrifying waste. No safety hazards associated with feeding the slurry onto molten glass at 1150 degrees Centigrade have been observed experimentally, even when the melter chamber was purposely flooded...|$|R

5|$|Staffa {{lies about}} 10kilometres (6mi) west of Mull, and 9km {{northeast}} of Iona. It is longitudinally oriented north-south, {{and is a}} kilometre long by about half a kilometre wide. The circumference is about 3.8km in extent. In the northeast the isle shelves to a shore, but otherwise the coast is rugged and much indented; numerous caves have been carved out by rain, streams and sea. There is enough grass to <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> few cattle, and the island has a spring.|$|E
5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle was not {{a primary}} {{strategic}} target for Scottish attack, as it was positioned away from the main routes through the region, but it was kept well garrisoned during the Scottish wars. The surrounding manor of Embleton had nonetheless suffered from Scottish raids and Gaunt had concerns over {{the condition of the}} castle's defences, ordering the building of additional fortifications around the gatehouse. Part of the surrounding lands around the castle may have been brought into agricultural production at this time, either to <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> growing garrison, or to protect the crops against Scottish attacks.|$|E
5|$|Two sanctified, stone-covered springs nearby <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> {{stream that}} is {{believed}} to hold powers of purification and flows through the buffer zone surrounding the royal city. Their water was used to form the sacred lake of Amparihy, artificially created by at least the 18th century to provide water to fill two ceremonial pools constructed within the Ambohimanga compound. Oral history attributes {{the creation of the}} lake to Andrianampoinimerina. He reportedly engaged the labor of surrounding villagers to dig the lake {{at the site of the}} spring-fed swamp at the base of the hill. Before initially filling the lake with water carried in baked earthen jars from the sacred sites of Alasora, Antsahatsiroa and Anosibe, the lake's creation was sanctified by sacrificing zebu at the site; Andrianampoinimerina is also said to have thrown pearls and silver rings into the lake to inaugurate it.|$|E
50|$|In industry, a {{rotary valve}} {{is used to}} {{regulate}} the flow of a product, usually to reduce the flow rate to a level more suitable to the process being undertaken. Typical applications are for <b>feeding</b> <b>a</b> weighed hopper or for <b>feeding</b> <b>a</b> mill that can be clogged by the product.|$|R

5|$|The HL234, {{an engine}} born from the {{developments}} initiated {{by attempting to}} convert the Maybach HL230 to fuel injection, would have increased the power to about 800 to 900 PS (hp). The Entwicklungskommission Panzer unanimously decided that HL234 be immediately included in the engine design and procurement program. The AK-7-200 was also explored {{as an alternative to}} the Maybach Olvar-B drive train, but Waffenamt research and development department Wa Prüf 6 found that it offered inferior driving characteristics and so the Maybach Olvar-B was retained. There are also a program using the Simmering- Graz-Pauker Sla.16 engine, but the war's constraint on supplies and capitulation resulted in the cancellation of this program. Krupp proposed mounting a new main weapon, the 10.5cm KwK L/68. Wa Prüf 6 was not supportive of this as the Heer had not accepted the cannon itself. Other suggested improvements included stabilised sights, a stabilised main gun, an automatic ammunition <b>feed,</b> <b>a</b> Zeiss stereoscopic range finder, heated crew compartment, stowage for an additional 12 rounds, and an overpressure & air filtration system to protect against poison gas. However, these also never got beyond the proposal stage or did not enter production before the war ended.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{includes}} a multiplayer mode, where up to four players can compete {{against each other in}} seven different game types: Beach, Raptor, Heist, War, Tank, Race and Deathmatch. In Beach, some players must go up through a beach and into a waiting escape vehicle, while others must stop them by firing at them from fixed positions. Raptor involves players controlling raptors to <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> baby dinosaur, while others play as cavemen that have to steal dinosaur eggs. Heist engrosses players in the robbery of a bank, where the goal is to retrieve a cash bag {{from the center of the}} level and run with it to the team's vault without being damaged. War can either be a traditional capture the flag mode or Total War, where players have to get the other teams gas canister and use it to release a chemical gas that annihilates the enemy. Similarly, in Tank players fight against each other by using tanks and grabbing chemical canisters that can release a lethal corrosive gas, destroying all the tanks that are outdoors. Race is a racing mode which provides two variations of the same course. Items can be acquired and used against opponents. Finally, there is a standard deathmatch mode where players fight against each other in shooting style from a third-person perspective. Players can set a number of different options for each game, such as score limit, number of lives, and inclusion of optional bots.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with Swift, clothed {{by a black}} {{sweater and}} jeans, walking through a {{university}} campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and performs in a balcony. After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands in the balcony, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase. Swift and Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.|$|E

25|$|Several {{types of}} balun are {{commonly}} used to <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> dipole antenna: current baluns and coax baluns. Baluns can be made using ferrite toroid cores or even from the coax feedline itself. The choice of the toroid core is crucial. A rule of thumb is: the more power, the bigger the core.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps a {{more exotic}} means to {{generate}} usable energy {{would be to}} <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> stellar mass into a black hole, and collect photons emitted by the accretion disc.

25|$|Horses require {{access to}} clean fresh water at all times, {{and access to}} {{adequate}} forage such as grass or hay. Unless an animal can be fully maintained on pasture with a natural open water source, horses must be fed daily. As horses evolved as continuous grazers, {{it is better to}} feed small amounts of feed throughout the day than to <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> large amount at one time.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the {{beginning}} of the diamond industry, all of South Africa was experiencing depressed economic conditions. Ostrich-farming was in its infancy, and agriculture had only been lightly developed. The Boers, except those in the immediate vicinity of Cape Town, lived in impoverished conditions. They only traded marginally with the Colony for durable goods. Even the British colonists were far from wealthy. The diamond industry was therefore considerably attractive, especially to colonists of British origin. It was also a means to demonstrate that South Africa, which appeared to be barren and poor on the surface, was rich below the ground. It takes ten acres (40,000m²) of Karoo to <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> sheep, but it was now possible that a few square metres of diamantiferous blue ground would be able to <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> dozen families. By the end of 1871, a large population had already gathered on the diamond fields, and immigration increased dramatically, which brought in many newcomers. Among the first to seek a fortune on the diamond fields was Cecil Rhodes.|$|E
