40|$|The anti-TNP {{antibody}} {{response of}} mice exposed to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{is a response}} where IgE antibody can be preferentially produced. Skin-painting with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> induces IgM, IgG and IgE antibody. After repeated painting the titre and persistence of the IgE but not IgG antibody is increased. Feeding <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> does not induce antibody but it does produce unresponsiveness for IgG without affecting responsiveness for IgE. Injection of picryl sulphonic acid produces unresponsiveness for both classes. The unresponsiveness (induced by feeding or injection) is found for responses to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> but responses to TNP-KLH are barely affected. Both the IgE and IgG responses to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> are initiated in the lymph nodes and then develop in the spleen.

40|$|Lymphocytes from mice immunized by {{painting}} with the contact sensitizing agent <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{have been shown}} to produce regulatory effects on the DNA synthesis and contact sensitivity responses of normal mice painted with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride.</b> This report describes the effect of these cells on antibody responses of normal mice to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride.</b> Lymph node cells taken 5 [...] 7 days after painting increased early IgM antibody responses of normal mice to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride.</b> Spleen cells were not effective. The increase was mediated by T cells as judged by anti-theta treatment and nylon wool filtration and could not be produced by killed, irradiated or allogeneic cells. A similar activity could be demonstrated in cells from mice painted with another contact sensitizing agent, oxazolone. The effect was strictly specific and cells from mice painted with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> or oxazolone would only increase responses to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> or oxazolone, respectively, even when presented with a mixture of the two antigens.

Catabolism of passively administered picryl-specific antibody did not alter the unresponsive state of picryl chloride-fed guinea pigs or the responsive state of normal guinea pigs. Lymphoid cells of <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> immunized guinea pigs produced equal amounts of picryl-specific antibody in picryl chloride-fed and normal animals. Allergen-fed guinea pigs remained unresponsive to attempted sensitization with the allergen in excess of 10 months after the final feeding, though some became feebly sensitive between 9 and 11 months.

Using this system it was found that cells from <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> but not oxazolone painted mice were inhibitory when injected 1 day after painting the recipients. The suppressor cells from the mice injected with picryl sulphonic acid and from the mice painted with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> were shown to be cyclophosphamide sensitive T cells and were not affected by adult thymectomy.

40|$|Contact {{sensitivity}} to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> was investigated {{by means of}} the ear swelling test and a radiometric test in order to establish optimal experimental conditions for these assays. Contact sensitivity was demonstrated as soon as 2 days after sensitization, with a maximum reaction 3 – 4 days after sensitization, when a 48 hr test reaction was registered. The test reaction was followed or 72 hr and maximum was arrived at after 24 hr and 48 hr for the ear swelling test and the radiometric test, respectively. Optimal sensitization was reached with a 7 % solution of <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> and a maximum test reaction was found with 0. 75 – 1. 0 % <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride.</b> It is concluded that both assays measure contact sensitivity in quantitative terms and a future replacement of the guinea pig maximization test is discussed...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study {{of the relationship between}} contact sensitivity to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> and delayed sensitivity to the picryl group of protein conjugates (1), the following observations were made: 1. Delayed sensitivity to the picryl group itself could be demonstrated in animals sensitized with a picryl conjugate and tested with a different picryl conjugate. Large testing doses were, however, required owing to the limited size of the picryl group. Delayed sensitivity to picryl protein conjugates generally appeared to entail a considerable degree of carrier specificity, that is specificity involving the environment of the picryl group on the carrier protein. 2. Guinea pigs immunized with picryl protein conjugates were shown to become contact-sensitive to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride,</b> especially if homologous protein conjugates, such as picrylated guinea pig skin or picryl guinea pig gamma globulin, were used. The contact reactions were less intense than the delayed reactions to the picryl conjugates used for immunization. 3. Guinea pigs sensitized with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> showed delayed sensitivity reactions to conjugates of picryl with homologous proteins, as well as contact reactions to picryl chloride; but the delayed reactions were far less severe than the contact reactions. These results were interpreted to mean that the relationship between contact sensitivity to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> and delayed sensitivity to picryl conjugates is that of two cross-reacting immunological systems with different carder specificity; it is indeed impossible to duplicate carder specificities equivalent to that resulting from the reaction of <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> with the numerous autologous proteins with which it is able to conjugate in vivo, by immunization with a single picryl protein conjugate, even though a homologous protei...|$|R

Erythrocytes obtained from guinea pigs after infusion or feeding of <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{may be used}} to sensitize other animals when injected with adjuvant.

40|$|Normal {{guinea pigs}} fed {{chemical}} haptens develop a specific state of unresponsiveness, inhibiting subsequent development of dermal sensitization {{with the same}} hapten and modifying profoundly the synthesis of anaphylactic antibody in response to hapten conjugated to guinea pig proteins. The degree of unresponsiveness has been tested by exposing hapten-fed animals to intense haptenic stimulation. Animals of groups that were demonstrably unresponsive to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{could be made to}} form hapten-specific antibody by injecting picrylated bovine gamma globulin. Specific anaphylactic-type antibodies, presumably 7 S γ 1, were synthesized, and in animals given PBGG adsorbed to alumina there arose a measurable concentration of precipitating antibody, presumably 7 S γ 2, perhaps slightly earlier than in similarly treated control animals. Attempts to impose contact-type reactivity on such unresponsive animals met with limited success. Injection of picrylated guinea pig erythrocyte stromata in a complete Freund's adjuvant, with subsequent applications of <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> to the dermis, led to definite contact sensitivity to 0. 3 per cent <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride,</b> whereas parallel treatment of normal control animals induced sensitivity to 0. 006 or 0. 002 per cent. By this double method of stimulation, hapten-fed animals did not advance in sensitivity by reason of the secondary dermal applications of the simple chemical, whereas control animals developed increasingly higher sensitivity by these contacts {{in what appeared to be}} a stepwise manner. Picryl chloride-fed guinea pigs injected intradermally with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> either after or before forming picryl-specific circulating antibody still remained unable to develop picryl-specific contact hypersensitivity. Control animals synthesizing picryl-specific antibody subsequently responded to intradermal injection of <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> with contact-type sensitivity. Interpretations of these results are discussed and the view is presented that delayed-type hypersensitivity and circulating antibodies of the varieties measured here are formed independently of each other...|$|R
40|$|The DNA {{response}} in the regional lymph nodes draining the site of immunization with contact sensitizing agents was assessed by measuring the uptake of radioactive iododeoxyuridine. The DNA {{response in}} the regional lymph nodes reached a peak on day 3 after immunization and fell to pre-immunization levels by day 6. The hypothesis was tested that lymph node cells from mice immunized with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> might depress the DNA response to the same antigen. Immune lymph node cells were injected intravenously and the recipient mice were immunized with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> on the same day. The immune cells depressed the DNA response on day 4 {{by an average of}} about 60 per cent. Smaller but significant depression also occurred on day 3. The cells responsible for the depression appeared in the regional lymph nodes 3 - 4 days after immunization and disappeared by day 21. The transfer of small numbers of immune cells (less than 2 - 5 X 10 (6)) increased the DNA response in recipients 4 days after immunization with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride.</b> The depression of the DNA response was largely specific. Pooled data from ten experiments showed that cells immunized with 4 -ethoxymethylene-phenyl oxazolone ('oxazolone') caused no depression of the DNA response to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride,</b> although in two of these experiments significant depression of about 21 per cent was seen.

40|$|We {{have tested}} the {{hypothesis}} that exposure to ultraviolet light would inhibit T helper- 1 (Th 1) responses and stimulate T helper- 2 (Th 2) responses, and that thus in a mouse model of allergic (i. e. extrinsic) asthma (using ovalbumin [OVA] as the allergen) increased symptoms would be observed, while in a model of Th 1 -dependent occupational asthma (in which <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> is the allergen) decreased symptoms would be observed. Whereas reduced interferon (IFN) -γ, production, decreased inflammatory responses in the airways, and reduced airway reactivity to nonspecific stimuli were observed in UV-preexposed <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> sensitized and challenged mice, the results in the OVA model were less clear. Increased interleukin (IL) - 10 production {{as a result of}} UV exposure was observed, together with unchanged IL- 4 and IFN-γ. In addition, decreased OVA-specific immunoglobin, IgG 1 and IgE, titers were noted, as well as decreased nonspecific airway hyperreactivity. Eosinophilic inflammatory responses were not influenced. The results indicate that UV exposure can have systemic effects that influence ongoing immune responses in the respiratory tract. The effects are not only restricted to immune responses that are predominantly Th 1 dependent (i. e. pulmonary delayed-type hypersensitivity and IFN-γ production in response to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride)</b> but also to immune response that are predominantly Th 2 dependent, i. e. decreased specific IgE titers...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that by the {{cutaneous}} administration of simple chemical compounds in small quantities— 2 : 4 : 6 trinitrochlorobenzene (<b>picryl</b> <b>chloride)</b> and 2 : 4 dinitrochlorobenzene, the latter a typical incitant of contact dermatitis in man—it is possible to induce true anaphylactic sensitization in guinea pigs, demonstrable by the intravenous injection of protein conjugates and by the Dale technique, using isolated uterine horns. This furnishes strong evidence for the formation of antigenic conjugates following application of substances of simple chemical constitution. Since the anaphylactic state is induced by the same method of administration that gives rise to cutaneous sensitivity, the assumption would appear justified, when one takes into account the chemical properties of the inciting substances, that the formation of conjugated antigens offers an explanation for the skin effects also. In the experiments with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride,</b> anaphylactic antibodies, and occasionally precipitins, have been demonstrated.

40|$|Cells {{taken from}} the {{draining}} lymph nodes of mice 1 day after painting with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> can induce contact hypersensitivity when injected into the footpads of normal recipients. Previous studies have presented {{evidence to show that}} this is an immunizing process rather than a transfer of sensitized cells. This study shows that footpad injection of 5 times 10 (6) 1 -day draining lymph node cells induces a similar degree of hypersensitivity to the original skin painting with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> but no antibody, as judged by anti-TNP splenic PFC and serum antibody, in contrast to the moderate antibody response found after skin painting. The apparent inability to induce a response did, however, correlate with the finding that the draining lymph nodes of mice painted with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> had few PFC. Some effect of the cells on antibody was noted in that after mice were challenged on the ear to produce contact sensitivity reactions they produced an antibody response larger than that of mice not injected with cells. This was not a large phenomenon but was unusual because 2 - 5 times 10 (6) cells was more effective than either 10 (6) or 5 times 10 (6) cells, even though 5 times 10 (6) cells produced the largest contact sensitivity reactions. The augmentation was antigen specific and the same dose-response effect could be obtained with irradiated cells (2000 rad). It is suggested that the ability of these cells to induce large contact sensitivity reactions without antibody indicates that they may have {{an important role in the}} immunogenicity of contact sensitizing agents, which can induce large delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions accompanied only by moderate antibody responses...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess whether}} hair {{follicle}} cycling influences skin immunity, {{we examined the}} association between highly synchronized hair follicle cycling and experimental contact hypersensitivity in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Hair cycle synchronization was performed by depilation of hair shafts on the back with telogen skin. Mice were sensitized on the lower back skin with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> between 0 and 25 d, after anagen induction by depilation, and challenged on the earlobes with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> 5 d later. The magnitude of contact hypersensitivity was significantly decreased in mice sensitized on day 1, was minimal on day 3 (early anagen), and slowly increased thereafter, reaching a level comparable to day 0 on day 25 (telogen). The significantly depressed contact hypersensitivity response in anagen skin was confirmed in mice with spontaneously developed follicles. Lymph node cells taken from mice sensitized with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> on days 0, 1, and 3 after depilation were cultured in vitro {{in the presence of}} syngeneic, haptenized, Langerhans cell-enriched epidermal cells. Marked proliferative responses of lymph node cells to haptenized Langerhans-cells were found in mice not only of day 0, but also of days 1 and 3, suggesting that immune T cells exist even in lymph node cells of the low-responsive mice. How cytometric analyses demonstrated that the number of intraepidermal Langerhans cells and their functions, including the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II, CD 54, and CD 86, and mixed epidermal cell lymphocyte reactions, were not changed in skin on days 0, 1, and 3. These findings demonstrate that contact hypersensitivity is induced most effectively via skin with telogen hair follicles and that the depressed response in early anagen skin is not simply due to failure in Langerhans cell functions or sensitization of T cells...|$|R
