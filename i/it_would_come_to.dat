His tribesmen were unhappy at Habibullah's perceived subservience to the British, and his council and relatives openly spoke of their suspicions at his inactivity. Habibullah began purging his court of officials who were known to be close to Nasrullah and Amanullah. He recalled emissaries he had sent to Persia for talks with Germany and Turkey for military aid. Meanwhile, the war took {{a turn for the worse}} for the Central Powers. The Arab revolt against Turkey and the loss of Erzurum to the Russians ended the hopes of sending a Turkish division to Afghanistan. The German influence in Persia also declined rapidly, ending the hopes that Goltz Pasha could lead a Persian volunteer division into Afghanistan. The mission came to realise that the Emir deeply mistrusted them. A further attempt by British intelligence to feed false information to the mission, purportedly originating from Goltz Pasha, convinced von Hentig of the Emir's lack of trust. A last offer was made by Nasrullah in May 1916 to remove Habibullah from power and lead the frontier tribes in a campaign against British India. However, von Hentig knew <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> nothing, and the Germans left Kabul on 21 May 1916. Niedermayer instructed Wagner to stay in Herat as a liaison officer. The Indian members also stayed, persisting in their attempts at an alliance.|$|E

500|$|Investigators also {{focused on}} deicing {{practices}} at LaGuardia. They {{found that the}} airport was using only Type I deicing fluid, not Type II. Type I fluids are used for the actual deicing of the jet, while Type II fluids are used for preventing buildup of ice. At {{the time of the}} accident, LaGuardia had prohibited the use of Type II deicing fluid because tests suggested that if it fell onto runways it reduced friction. Investigators noted the change had been made because of LaGuardia's shorter runways and the fact that if an aircraft left the vicinity of the runway, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> rest in the cold water surrounding Runway 13. The accident report, however, criticised the fact {{that the majority of the}} airplane operators in the United States relied only upon Type I fluids for protection, and they do not use Type II. The board stated that tests have shown that both Type I and Type II fluids do flow off the wings of a treated airplane in significant amounts during the initial takeoff ground run.

500|$|They were on {{the road}} again three days later when they faced Ipswich Town at Portman Road. Argyle came away with all three points {{courtesy}} of goals from Wright-Phillips and Mason on what was a special night for Paul Mariner. [...] "It was pretty special and I was a little choked up," [...] he said. [...] "It was a special night. When I moved to the States 20 years ago, I didn't think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition but it was a tremendous reception from the fans, and I can't thank them enough. Bringing Plymouth Argyle here in my present role was a special occasion." [...] Former manager Ian Holloway returned to Home Park {{for the first time since}} his departure in November 2007 in the club's next game, and he left happy as Blackpool side claimed all three points after a 2–0 victory, with Charlie Adam at the heart of their attacking threat. Argyle played out an entertaining 0–0 draw at home with Barnsley three days later, but it did little to help in their battle against relegation, still five points away from safety. They produced another rousing away performance against Doncaster Rovers to earn a 2–1 win, coming from behind with second-half goals from Mason, and an injury time header from Wright-Phillips. In order to stay up, Argyle knew that they had to make the most of their remaining home games, but they went down 2–0 on 5 April to an efficient Middlesbrough side, which left them four points adrift with four games left. A solitary goal from Watford's Heidar Helguson dealt Argyle's survival hopes an almost fatal blow at Vicarage Road, but vice-captain Karl Duguid remained upbeat about their chances of defeating the league leaders in their next game. [...] "We'll be upbeat, and we'll go for the win against Newcastle next Monday." ...|$|E
500|$|The Mr. Hankey {{character}} {{was based on}} an idea Trey Parker's father created when he was toilet-training Trey as a child. Parker said he refused to flush the toilet as a child, so his father told him if he did not flush down his stool, which he called [...] "Mr. Hankey", <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> life and kill him. The concept stayed with Parker throughout his childhood; starting in elementary school and throughout his entire education, he would often draw the character in class, wearing a sailor's hat instead of the Santa Claus hat he would later wear in South Park. Parker shared the concept with future South Park co-creator Matt Stone when the two met at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and the duo immediately knew they wanted to create a film or production involving Mr. Hankey. The two discussed filming a three-minute short film involving a boy who befriended the talking stool, but Mr. Hankey would not come alive for anybody else, prompting others to believe the boy was crazy. They planned for the boy's parents to find him holding a stool in the bathroom and blame the child for smearing feces along the walls when it was actually Mr. Hankey's fault; they also planned to have him visit a school counselor, where Mr. Hankey would leap into the counselor's coffee mug and the boy would be blamed. At the end, it would turn out that the boy was indeed crazy and Mr. Hankey was not real at all, but a figment of the boy's imagination. Parker and Stone never made the short film, but practically all of its elements were included in the future South Park episode [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", with the notable exception of the ending.|$|E
500|$|As {{the tenth}} {{anniversary of the}} Tsar's {{execution}} approached in July 1928, Botkin retained a lawyer, Edward Fallows, to oversee legal moves to obtain any of the Tsar's estate outside of the Soviet Union. As {{the death of the}} Tsar had never been proved, the estate could only be released to relatives ten years after the supposed date of his death. Fallows set up a company, called the Grandanor Corporation (an acronym of Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia), which sought to raise funds by selling shares in any prospective estate. Tschaikovsky claimed that the Tsar had deposited money abroad, which fed unsubstantiated rumors of a large Romanov fortune in England. The surviving relatives of the Romanovs accused Botkin and Fallows of fortune hunting, and Botkin accused them of trying to defraud [...] "Anastasia" [...] out of her inheritance. Except for a relatively small deposit in Germany, distributed to the Tsar's recognized relations, no money was ever found. After a quarrel, possibly over Tschaikovsky's claim to the estate (but not over her claim to be Anastasia), Tschaikovsky moved out of the Leeds' mansion, and the pianist Sergei Rachmaninoff arranged for her to live at the Garden City Hotel in Hempstead, New York, and later in a small cottage. To avoid the press, she was booked in as Mrs. Anderson, the name by which she was subsequently known. In October 1928, after the death of the Tsar's mother, the Dowager Empress Marie, the 12 nearest relations of the Tsar met at Marie's funeral and signed a declaration that denounced Anderson as an impostor. The Copenhagen Statement, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be known, explained: [...] "Our sense of duty compels us to state that the story is only a fairy tale. The memory of our dear departed would be tarnished if we allowed this fantastic story to spread and gain any credence." [...] Gleb Botkin answered with a public letter to Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, which referred to the family as [...] "greedy and unscrupulous" [...] and claimed they were only denouncing Anderson for money.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, as the second-string quarterback, he saw {{his first}} action against [...] when he was {{substituted}} for injured starter Jordan Steffy. Turner executed a scoring drive and completed four of six passes, but also threw two interceptions. He sat out the next two games and then took one snap against Wake Forest. When the unranked Terps faced 10th-ranked Rutgers, Steffy suffered a concussion and Turner again filled in. He led drives for two touchdowns and two field goals in an upset of the Scarlet Knights, 34–24. About the then relatively unknown Turner, Rutgers head coach Greg Schiano said, [...] "I wish I would have seen this guy before." [...] Turner started for the remaining eight games of the season. In his career-first start, he passed for 255yards in a win against Georgia Tech, 28–26. In the game, he threw a 78-yard touchdown pass, which was caught by tight end Jason Goode rather than his intended receiver, Darrius Heyward-Bey. After a three-game losing streak, Turner led another upset win over a top-ten team, this time against eighth-ranked Boston College, 42–35. In the 24–16 loss to Florida State, Turner had his worst performance of the season. Late in the second quarter, he was benched and replaced by Steffy for two possessions. Turner said, [...] "I didn't know that my leash was that short in the first place, to be honest. I didn't think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> this. I guess I should have." [...] After an uneven performance by Steffy, Turner played the entire second half and showed improvement. The following week Maryland played their regular season finale against NC State and both teams needed an additional win to attain bowl eligibility. Maryland led in the second quarter, 3–0, but was struggling offensively. Turner, a generally immobile pocket quarterback, invigorated the offense when he executed a 41-yard option run for a first down. He completed 19 of 24 passes for 206 yards and led a shutout of NC State, 37–0. With the sixth win, Maryland was invited to the Emerald Bowl, where they were beaten by Oregon State, 21–14. Turner finished the season as the third-most efficient passer in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).|$|E

Continuing financial losses, a lack of proper Canadian football venues, a pervasive belief that the American teams were simply pawns to provide the struggling Canadian teams with expansion fee revenue, and the return of the NFL to Baltimore prompted the end of Canadian football on the American side of the border.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the letter}} to the Corinthians, within the list of people who will not inherit the kingdom of God, Paul uses two Greek words: malakoi and arsenokoitai. Malakoi is a common Greek word meaning, of things subject to touch, [...] "soft" [...] (used in Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25 to {{describe}} a garment); of things not subject to touch, [...] "gentle"; and, of persons or modes of life, a number of meanings that include [...] "pathic". Nowhere else in scripture is Malakoi used to describe a person. Bishop Gene Robinson says the early church seemed to have understood it as a person with a [...] "soft" [...] or weak morality; later, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> denote (and be translated as) those who engage in masturbation, or [...] "those who abuse themselves"; all we actually, factually, know about the word is that it means soft.|$|E
