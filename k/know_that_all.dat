500|$|According to Clem Bastow of The Sydney Morning Herald, [...] "Black Coffee", in particular, won All Saints [...] "major {{critical}} points" [...] {{over the}} Spice Girls and complemented the group's [...] "impeccable back catalogue". Graeme Virtue of the Sunday Herald hailed {{it as one}} of [...] "the best pop singles ever". Kathy McCabe of the Herald Sun deemed the song [...] "the benchmark of sassy, harmony-laden pop". Christie Leo of the New Straits Times wrote: [...] "The aromatic shimmer of 'Black Coffee' alone is all the evidence you'll need to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>All</b> Saints were truly heavenly." [...] Ian Sturgess of the Daily Mirror said the track: [...] "boasts one of the most infectious pop choruses of all time". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian found [...] "Black Coffee" [...] superior to [...] "Pure Shores", praising its [...] "beguiling treatment of a domestic scenario" [...] and citing its lyrics as [...] "easily the most alluring depiction of a bleary-eyed morning routine ever recorded." [...] Q magazine placed [...] "Black Coffee" [...] in their list of 1010 Songs You Must Own.|$|E

Following the Olympia Theatre residency, R.E.M. scheduled three-week recording sessions in three different cities {{in order to keep}} its focus. The tight recording schedule prevented Stipe from spending too much time working on his lyrics and vocal parts. Stipe told Spin, [...] "I work really well under pressure, and the guys <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> too well... So the pace forced me to kind of spit stuff out."

The front is broken near Sedan." [...] Indeed, such was the situation regarding equipment and morale that Reynaud received a postcard found on the body of an officer who had committed suicide in Le Mans.

2500|$|W.V.O. Quine {{offers a}} {{practical}} {{solution to this problem}} by making the metaphysical claim that only predicates that identify a [...] "natural kind" [...] (i.e. a real property of real things) can be legitimately used in a scientific hypothesis. R. Bhaskar also offers {{a practical solution}} to the problem. He argues that the problem of induction only arises if we deny the [...] possibility [...] of [...] a [...] reason for the predicate, [...] located [...] in [...] the [...] enduring [...] nature [...] of [...] something. For example, we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> emeralds are green, not because we have only ever seen green emeralds, but because the chemical make-up of emeralds insists that they must be green. If we were to change that structure, they would not be green. For instance, emeralds are a kind of green beryl, made green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Without these trace elements, the gems would be colourless.|$|E
2500|$|I {{would have}} to pick Erica's legal {{abortion}} back in 1973. Number one, it was timely. Abortion had only recently been legalized when Erica decided not to have her baby. Secondly, it was a bold move. I can't think of a hotter political topic for the time than abortion (it still remains a subject that soaps tend to avoid as much as possible; women may contemplate abortions, but rarely go through with having them). Erica's abortion let the fans <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>All</b> My Children was going to tackle some major issues. What made it work {{was the fact that}} it was the perfect marriage of character to social issue storyline. We've all watched shows where some character develops a social issue problem that feels artificial to them as though it's been tacked onto them as some sort of glorified public service announcement. But Erica's abortion made sense. She was a rising model who didn't want a baby to derail that career. Whether you agree or disagree with her decision, you understand her rationale. That really is important for these social issue storylines to succeed [...] that they really be paired up with the right characters.|$|E

Agyeman feels that Martha's relationship with Tom has [...] "helped cement where she is in life". Agyeman also feels that it was important for Martha's mother Francine to re-appear in [...] "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End", as closure for what happened to the Jones family in Series Three: [...] "It's great for the audience to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> this talk of Martha wanting to stay on earth because of her family is for real. It's great to see Adjoa there, representing the Jones clan, even though it's a fleeting appearance. She's still very much in Martha's life".|$|E
