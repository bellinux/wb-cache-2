50|$|The {{number of}} {{cylinder}} heads in an engine {{is a function}} of the engine configuration. Almost all inline (straight) engines today use a single cylinder head that serves all the cylinders. A V (or Vee) engine has two cylinder heads, one for each cylinder bank of the 'V'. For a few compact 'narrow angle' V engines, such as the Volkswagen VR6, the angle between the cylinder banks is so narrow that it uses a single <b>head</b> <b>spanning</b> the two banks. A flat engine (basically a V engine, where the angle between the cylinder banks is now 180°) has two heads. Most radial engines have one head for each cylinder, although this is usually of the monobloc form wherein the head is made as an integral part of the cylinder. This is also common for motorcycles, and such head/cylinder components are referred-to as barrels.|$|R

40|$|Time-span tree in Lerdahl and Jackendoff's theory [12] {{has been}} {{regarded}} as one of the most dependable representations of musical structure. We first show how to formalize the time-span tree in feature structure, introducing <b>head</b> and <b>span</b> features. Then, we introduce join and meet operations among them. The span feature represents the temporal length during which the head pitch event is most salient. Here, we regard this temporal length as the amount of information which the pitch event carries; i. e., when the pitch event is reduced, the information comparable to the length is lost. This allows us to define the notion of distance as the sum of lost time-spans. Then, we employ the distance as a promising candidate of stable and consistent metric of similarity. We show the distance possesses proper mathematical properties, including the uniqueness of the distance among the shortest paths. After we show examples with concrete music pieces, we discuss how our notion of distance is positioned among other notions of distance/similarity. Finally, we summarize our contributions and discuss open problems...|$|R

Typical measurement uncertainties of these parameters, on one hand, and the range in which they typically reside, on the other hand, are mapped on variations of lateral and vertical position and lifetime of the wake vortices. For this mapping process the D 2 P wake vortex model is employed complemented by some simple considerations, dimensional analysis, and sources from literature. Three scenarios comprising cruise conditions, flight within the atmospheric boundary layer, and ground proximity are considered. From these investigations the following ranking of the impact parameters has been deduced: wind, thermal stratification, turbulence, position, mass, spanwise load factor. The relevance of the remaining parameters appears small...|$|R

30|$|Firstly, we {{divide the}} sensors into {{clusters}} {{according to their}} positions. We divide the monitored area into squares, whose length of the side is D. The length of the side D is given by the users according to the specified applications. Each cluster has a cluster head, and all the sensor nodes in the cluster transmit their critical points to the cluster head. All cluster <b>heads</b> compose a <b>spanning</b> tree, where the base station {{is the root of}} the spanning tree and cluster heads transmit the critical points along the spanning tree. Secondly, each time a sensor samples a critical point, it transmit the critical point and its position to the cluster head. The cluster head will determine whether the critical points it received need to be reduced according to the positions. When the distance of two critical points is less than L, only one of the critical points will be transmitted, where L is a parameter given by the users.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} {{distributed}} energy efficient clustering protocol for target surveillance in sensor networks (EECTS). The protocol selects cluster heads {{according to a}} hybrid of node’s residual energy and distribution of its neighbors. In addition, {{for the sake of}} reducing the energy dissipation of the cluster <b>head,</b> a minimum <b>spanning</b> tree with root of the base station is constructed among the cluster heads. Then it sends the gathered data to its upstream node along the spanning tree. The chief task of surveillance sensor networks is to sensing the moving target. So an intra-cluster node schedule method named EECTS- 1 that can senses the most part of the network and it’s enhanced method EECTS- 2 are introduced. The two methods can obtain the high continuous surveillance degree when the moving target enters into the network. EECTS produces a linear network lifetime in the number of nodes and keeps good continuous surveillance degree simultaneously. The simulation results show that with the same performance of surveillance the EECTS- 1 achieves the same lifetime as that HEED obtains and outperforms DEEG with up to 35 % improvement. The EECTS- 2 outperforms HEED significantly with prolonging the network lifetime about 70 %~ 80 %. Therefore the EECTS is suitable for military target surveillance and has high reliability of the sensing information.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry is increasingly looking for solutions {{that are both}} simple and effective and that provide cost savings, speed and flexibility of execution. Two-way slabs are a form of construction unique to reinforced concrete comparing with the other major structural materials. It is an efficient, economical, and widely used structural system. The present dissertation aims to analyze and compare costs between four types of slabs: waffle slab with recuperate molds, flat slabs with drop panels, two-way slabs with beams and flat plates. In this analysis the loads considered for the floors were of a residential type. The most common spans for slabs were considered. For {{the analysis of the}} slabs the simplified methods were used. For the design, security checks and construction rules, it was considered the current legislation applied in the member countries of the European Committee for Standardization, namely the Eurocodes. In order to compare the cost of usage of these four types of floor systems, in the analysis of the results it is shown the price for the necessary resources and the total cost of each slab for each study model per m 2 of total area of a building. From this dissertation, the conclusion may be drawn that waffle slabs have a lower cost than flat slabs with enlarged column <b>heads</b> for all <b>spans</b> considered and respectively flat plates have a lower cost than slabs with beams. From all of the slabs, waffle slab is the most economical one in the range of considered spans. Mestrado em Engenharia Civi...|$|R
40|$|Background: the {{majority}} of anthropometric assessments in Turner syndrome (TS) patients has focused on height. AIM: To analyze body proportions in young adult TS patients either treated or not treated with rhGH, and to compare them {{with a group of}} age-matched healthy women. Subjects and methods: Standing height, sitting height, weight, foot and leg lengths, arm <b>span,</b> <b>head</b> circumference, biliac and bi-acromial diameters were measured in 52 non-treated TS patients, 30 treated with rhGH and 133 healthy women. Results: Age at the start of rhGH therapy varied from 7. 8 to 15. 1 yr (10. 0 +/- 1. 3 yr), the duration of treatment from 2. 8 to 8. 2 yr (3. 7 +/- 1. 5 yr) and the mean recombinant human GH (rhGH) dose was 0. 42 mg/kg/week (from 0. 32 to 0. 50 mg/kg/week). Non-treated patients did not show any difference in anthropometric variables when compared with the treated ones, except for hand length (p= 0. 02) and height (p= 0. 05), which were increased in the treated group. All anthropometric variables, except head circumference, were different when comparing TS patients (either treated or not) with age-matched healthy women. Conclusion: Brazilian TS patients either treated or not with rhGH showed almost no differences in terms of their body proportions. This result is probably due to the late age at the start of treatment, and/or the short period of rhGH administration. Hand length was different between the groups, showing the importance of including the extremities in body proportion assessment during rhGH treatment of TS patients. (J. Endocrinol.

The BMI (body mass index) and WHR (waist hip ratio) of males and females were 21. 4 ± 3. 2 kg/m^ 2 and 0. 804 ± 0. 055 in males, and 20. 9 ± 2. 5 kg/m^ 2 and 0. 717 ± 0. 037 in female, the former fell in with normal values of Japanese males and females aged 18 years. However, the skinfolds of those students showed a significantly higher than normal value (p< 0. 001), and the percentages of body fat (calculated by using skinfolds) were higher, too. In the physical fitness test (side step, vertical jump, back strength, grip strength, trunk extension, standing trunk flexion) and the motor ability test (50 m dash, long jump, standing long jump endurance run), mean values of males and females showed significantly lower in almost all the tests than normal values (p< 0. 001).
