50|$|The {{front hall}} was the {{introduction}} to the house, and as such was {{an important part of the}} Victorian home. Furnishings were selected not only to make it a useful place to hang a hat and coat, store an umbrella and leave a calling card, but also to show family wealth, social position and knowledge of current styles. A hall stand or a hatrack was the most important piece of furniture. These were new forms that appeared about 1840, as homes became larger and social visits became more structured; see also <b>Hall</b> <b>Tree.</b>|$|E

We give new proofs {{of the unique}} factorisation of words into decreasing products of Hall words. An order < H on the free monoid is then constructed upon the unique factorisation of words. When the Hall set is the set of Lyndon words, the order < H coincides with the lexicographical order (with which Lyndon words are defined). Motivated by this fact, we give combinatorial properties of Hall words, related to the order < H, which generalize known properties of Lyndon words to Hall words...|$|R
50|$|A <b>hall</b> <b>tree</b> is a {{piece of}} furniture, usually found in {{hallways}} or near the entryway of homes, on which people hang items such as hats, coats, or other clothing. They often have mirrors and drawers to store personal items such as wallets, sunglasses, money, etc. Many incorporate a bench to sit upon while putting on or taking off footwear. The bench seat is often hinged with a storage space underneath often used for shoes, hats and gloves. Most hall trees are made of wood. In Victorian times some of the better quality hall trees were made of walnut or oak.|$|E

50|$|The Church of St Andrew {{is located}} {{to the east}} of the village, {{adjacent}} to the River Nene; it dates from the late 12th century. The main period of construction was in the 13th and 14th centuries and the building was restored and extended in 1876. Cotterstock Hall was built in 1658 with alterations in the early 18th century and a main staircase added in the 19th century. The poet and playwright John Dryden was a frequent visitor and is thought to have stayed in the south-west attic room at the Hall, visiting relatives, the last of whom, Rev Sir George Booth, died in 1797. Also of interest is the Old Mill which was built during the early 19th century. Cotterstock parish contains 20 entries on the statutory list of buildings of special architectural or historic interest, 16 of which are within the Conservation Area covering {{the eastern part of the}} village around St Andrew's Church and Cotterstock <b>Hall.</b> <b>Tree</b> Preservation Orders have been made on trees in and around the village.

40|$|In {{the first}} purpose, we {{concentrate}} on the theory of quantum integrable systems underlying the Connes-Kreimer approach. We introduce a new family of Hamiltonian systems depended on the perturbative renormalization process in renormalizable theories. It is observed that the renormalization group can determine an infinite dimensional integrable system such that this fact provides a link between this proposed class of motion integrals and renormalization flow. Moreover, with help of the integral renormalization theorems, we study motion integrals underlying Bogoliubv character and BCH series to obtain a new family of fixed point equations. In the second goal, we consider the combinatorics of Connes-Marcolli approach to provide a Hall rooted tree type reformulation from one particular object in this theory namely, universal Hopf algebra of renormalization H_U. As the consequences, interesting relations between this Hopf algebra and some well-known combinatorial Hopf algebras are obtained and also, one can make a new Hall polynomial representation from universal singular frame such that based on the universal nature of this special loop, one can expect a <b>Hall</b> <b>tree</b> type scattering formula for physical information such as counterterms. In the third aim, with attention to the given rooted tree version of H_U and by applying the Connes-Marcolli's universal investigation, we discover a new geometric explanation from Dyson-Schwinger equations.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the combinatorics resulting from the perturbative expansion of the transition amplitude in quantum field theories, and the relation of this expansion to the Hausdorff series leads naturally to consider an infinite dimensional Lie subalgebra and the corresponding enveloping Hopf algebra, to which the elements of this series are associated. We show that {{in the context of}} these structures the power sum symmetric functionals of the perturbative expansion are Hopf primitives and that they are given by linear combinations of Hall polynomials, or diagrammatically by Hall trees. We show that each <b>Hall</b> <b>tree</b> corresponds to sums of Feynman diagrams each with the same number of vertices, external legs and loops. In addition, since the Lie subalgebra admits a derivation endomorphism, we also show that with respect to it these primitives are cyclic vectors generated by the free propagator, and thus provide a recursion relation by means of which the (n+ 1) -vertex connected Green functions can be derived systematically from the n-vertex ones. By the application of an algebra homomorphism to these primitives {{and the use of the}} Connes-Kreimer twisted antipode axiom together with the Birkhoff algebraic decomposition, we investigate their relevance to the renormalization process and arrive in a rather straightforward and heuristic manner at the basic equation of renormalization theory from which the explicit relations between the bare and physical parameters of the theory may be derived, and from which the corresponding renormalized Green functions, as well as the Renormalization Group equations in the Mass Independen...|$|E
