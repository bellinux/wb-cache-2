500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> grow and <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have a purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able}} to get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E
500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work. John, now, he's a take-charge guy... you what the other guy's going to do, what he's going to do, and what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|E
2500|$|Marshall {{is known}} for his ability to break and dodge tackles. He led all NFL wide {{receivers}} in yards after first contact for the 2007 NFL season. Regarding Marshall's breakaway ability, cornerback Brandon Flowers said, [...] "Brandon Marshall is a defensive lineman playing wide receiver. He wants to inflict punishment on you. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> try to tackle him so he can shove you off of him and get more yards." [...] Cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha said Marshall is [...] "the toughest guy to bring down, one-on-one." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What has Jacobus done? Did <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> marry again, Captain?" [...] I inquired in a deferential tone. But he was {{launched}} now and only grinned fiercely.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well--I rather {{think he}} does. That is, {{not to give}} them, of course; you don't suppose <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> make him a present of money. But <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{accommodate}} him {{with the price of}} them. You can either do that, or let him have so many of your own; it will be as broad as it is long; and he'll give you his note of hand for the amount.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{go to the}} Blue Posts, did he?" [...] said Miriam {{when she}} heard of the proposition. [...] "It's like him. If {{there is to be}} any money spent it's {{anywhere}} but at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess you're right, {{but your}} {{speaking}} of India, {{reminds me of}} something I want to mention. I've been thinking over what Clarke said <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> His game's obvious, and {{it might have been}} a profitable one. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> help him in squeezing Colonel Challoner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{give up the}} Tower--just yet. That is what--he {{has brought}} you here for. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> give it up and go back. Don't!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Laguerre also instituted the {{innovative}} concept of one long {{story at the}} end of every issue, which he called the [...] "bonus piece". These well-written, in-depth articles helped to distinguish Sports Illustrated from other sports publications, and helped launch the careers of such legendary writers as Frank Deford, who in March 2010 wrote of Laguerre, [...] "He smoked cigars and drank Scotch and made the sun move across the heavens ... His genius as an editor was that <b>he</b> made <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> please him, but <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do that by writing in your own distinct way." ...|$|R

5000|$|Regarding {{the song}} Blue Denim, Nicks stated, [...] "Well, I wrote this... um, it's {{a song about}} this guy who came into my life, but left just as quick. And his eyes were that intense, that it just makes you, even if you didn't know him, you would go, like, 'wow.' And you could be, like, the toughest person, but those eyes would make <b>you</b> be {{whatever}} <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! old Boozer," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "you {{was afraid}} of old Boozer! Why, bless you, he wouldn't hurt a worm! He ain't got a tooth in his head, he ain't; we has to feed him with a spoon; and I'm sure the way the cat chivies him about must be enough to make his life a burden to him. I expect <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> nurse him; <b>he's</b> used to being nursed." ...|$|R
5000|$|All I knew {{at first}} was that I liked him and {{respected}} him, and then I grew to adore him. Whatever Arthur asked of me, I {{did to the}} best of my ability. And I was blessed to be in such safe hands. Every piece of that experience was protected. He wasn't casual about his work in any way—you knew exactly what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do. <b>He</b> was meticulous. Ali MacGraw, on the making of Love Story ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{about the}} iron church, papa. He {{says it is}} come--or part of it has, come--and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go out to Cumberly Green about the site." ...|$|E

6000|$|My wife {{looked at}} me with a glance in which I saw tender affection dangerously near contempt. [...] "You are a very {{forgiving}} man, Basil," [...] she said, and I looked down sheepishly. [...] "Well, at any rate, you have had the sense not to mix yourself up in his business. Did he pretend that he came straight <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{as soon as he got}} out? I suppose <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> believe that <b>he</b> appealed <b>to</b> <b>you</b> before he tried anybody else." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's certain. <b>He</b> won't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go {{down and}} look him up; you'll get word from him before long. Whether you'll get your {{provisions}} or not is another matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|Williams went on. [...] "He's weak, {{too weak}} to talk much, and so I'm {{going to tell you}} what he wants. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> marry him before he dies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{something}} we've {{found that}} <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> see," [...] Harry whispered; {{and turning to}} the crew, who were lying on their oars a short distance away, Mr. Vandyne said: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Why,' says <b>he,</b> 'I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> head her off. I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> cut me out. I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{come to the}} rescue. Suppose {{you seen}} a wildcat about for to eat me, what would you do?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Green put up her {{spectacles}} on her forehead, {{and stared}} at her daughter, while some strong expressions, out of the plebeian or rustic past which lies only a generation or two behind most of us, rose to her lips.
