First, the Kalman filter is used to provide estimates of the position and vel-ocity of a target based upon observations of the target's bearing. Two sensors, a radar in receive mode and an infra-red sensor, take bearings to the target at different scan rates. This information is then fused within the filter to obtain the target's track...|$|E

They dem-onstrated that dimethyladenosine increased coronary blood flow and thallium- 201 uptake to normal areas of myocardium, whereas areas of myocardium served by a coronary artery with hemodynamically signifi-cant coronary artery narrowing had a reduced flow reserve and hence less thallium- 201 uptake.
