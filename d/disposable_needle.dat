40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} whether {{the use of}} a <b>disposable</b> <b>needle</b> guide results in a decreased incidence of infectious complication after transrectal prostate needle biopsy (TPNB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty five patients who underwent 10 -core TPNB were randomized into two groups. A pre-biopsy blood and urine examination was performed in both groups. Group 1 (25 patients) underwent biopsy with disposable biopsy needle guide and Group 2 (30 patients) underwent biopsy with reusable biopsy needle guide. All patients had a blood and negative urine culture before the procedure. The patients received ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day beginning the day before the biopsy and continued for 3 days after. Serum C-reactive protein levels and urine and blood specimens were obtained 48 h after the biopsy. Primary endpoint {{of the study was to}} determine the effect of needle guide on the bacteriologic urinary tract infection (UTI) rate and secondary end point was to determine symptomatic UTI. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 63. 46 (range 55 to 68) years. There were no significant differences regarding the prostate-specific antigen level, prostate size, existence of comorbidity in two groups before the procedure. Bacteriologic and symptomatic UTI was detected in 4 % vs. 6. 6 % and 4 % vs. 3. 9 % in Group 1 and 2 relatively (P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The use of a <b>disposable</b> <b>needle</b> guide does not appear to minimize infection risk after TPNB. Large scale and randomized studies are necessary to determine the effect of <b>disposable</b> <b>needle</b> guide on infection rate after TPNB...|$|E

40|$|While {{considerable}} {{attention has been}} directed at {{the important role of}} intravenous drug use in the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B, little research to date has been conducted on the role of medicine injections in disease transmission. This is the case despite the fact that (a) the number of medicine injections is several orders of magnitude greater than injections of illegal drugs and (b) the networks of people potentially affected by contaminated medicine injection paraphernalia is far wider. In this article we examine the medicine injecting practices of a random sample of 40 registered medical practitioners (RMP) who have not had formal training in allopathic medicine (do not have MBBS or MD degrees) in Tamil Nadu, India.

40|$|This study quantitatively {{assessed}} injection pressure, pain, {{and anxiety}} {{at the start}} of injection of a local anesthetic into the oral mucosa, and confirmed the relationship between injection pressure and pain, as well as between injection pressure and anxiety. Twenty-eight healthy men were selected as subjects and a 0. 5 -inch (12 mm) 30 -gauge <b>disposable</b> <b>needle</b> attached to a computer-controlled local anesthetic delivery system (the Wand) was used. A 0. 5 mL volume of local anesthetic solution was injected submucosally at a speed of either 30 or 160 s/mL.

Injection pressure was measured continuously in real time by using an invasive sphygmomanometer and analytical software, and pain was assessed on the Visual Analogue Scale and anxiety on the Faces Anxiety Scale. A significant correlation was evident between injection pressure and pain (rs =. 579, P =. 00124) and between intensity of injection pressure and state anxiety (rs =. 479, P =. 00979).

40|$|BACKGROUND : Lymphadenopathy is a {{commonly}} encountered clinical problem. Fine needle aspiration cytology offers the alternative of an immediate, preliminary, although not always specific diagnosis with little trauma and cost, thus providing ample information for further management {{and reduce the}} amount of open biopsy. MATERIAL AND METHODS:  FNAC was performed using 21 gauge needle attached with 10 ml <b>disposable</b> <b>needle.</b> Slides were prepared, two were air dried and stained with field stain where as two were fixed in ethanol and was stained with PAP stain. One slide was stained with Ziehl-Neelson stain. Field and PAP stained slide were reviewed and diagnosed by Pathologist. RESULT: Out of the 225 patients, reactive lymphadenitis was the most common diagnosis (54. 2 %), followed by tubercular lymphadenitis (33. 44 %). Among the age group percentage of tubercular lymphadenitis was more in 210 - 30 years of age.  Majority of the metastatic carcinoma was in cervical region, comprising mainly squamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSION : Reactive lymphadenitis was {{the most common cause of}} lymphadenopathy especially in case of children. In case of older population, definite pathology for lymph node enlargement was found in most of the cases. Hence FNAC is warranted in lymphadenopathy, as it is simple yet of great diagnostic value. </p...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{attribute}} of interest of surface nanobubbles is their unusual stability {{and a number}} of theories trying to explain this have been put forward. Interestingly, the dissolution of nanobubbles is a topic that did not receive a lot of attention yet. In this work we applied two different experimental procedures which should cause gaseous nanobubbles to completely dissolve. In our experiments we nucleated nanobubble-like objects by putting a drop of water on HOPG using a plastic syringe and a <b>disposable</b> <b>needle.</b> In method A, the nanobubble-like objects were exposed to a flow of degassed water (1. 17 mg l− 1) for 96 hours. In method B, the ambient pressure was lowered in order to degas the liquid and the nanobubble-like objects. Interestingly, the nanobubble-like objects remained stable after exposure to both methods. After thorough investigation of the procedures and materials used during our experiments, we found that the nanobubble-like objects were induced by the use of disposable needles in which PDMS contaminated the water. It is very important for the nanobubble community {{to be aware of the}} fact that, although features look and behave like nanobubbles, in some cases they might in fact be induced by contamination.

40|$|Background and Aims: Intra-operative {{identification}} {{and preservation of}} extraocular motor nerves {{is one of the}} main goals of surgeries for skull base tumours and this is done by monitoring the extraocular movement (EOM). Intra-operative electromyographic monitoring has been reported, but it is a complex and skilful process. Electrooculography (EOG) is a simple and reliable technique for monitoring EOMs. We aimed to assess the utility of EOG monitoring in preventing extraocular motor nerve dysfunction during skull base surgeries. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, intra-operative EOG recordings were obtained using <b>disposable</b> <b>needle</b> electrodes placed on the periorbital skin and the polarity of the waves noted for interpretation. Triggered as well as continuous EOG responses were recorded after monopolar electrode stimulation of cranial nerve (CN) during tumour removal which helped the surgeon with careful dissection and avoiding potential nerve injuries. Results: Of the 11 cases monitored, oculomotor and abducent nerves were identified in all cases, but the trochlear nerve could not be definitively identified. Six patients had no pre- or post-operative extraocular motor nerve dysfunction. The other five patients had pre-existing deficits before surgery, which recovered completely in two, significantly in one, and did not improve in two patients at 3 - 6 months follow-up. Conclusions: EOG was found to be a simple and reliable method of monitoring extraocular motor nerves (CNs III and VI) intraoperatively...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to modify the routinely used ovum pick up (OPU) devices to permit use of disposable needles and to simplify the technique and to make it more economical and practical to use. Long nondisposible needles are commonly used in transvaginal OPU despite several disadvantages. A new OPU device was developed using 19 -g disposable needles to eliminate these disadvantages and to make the technique more successful. The <b>disposable</b> <b>needle</b> was connected to silicone tubing by means of a stainless steel connector. The system was inserted into a stainless steel tube, creating a rigid structure within which to move the needle back and forth. A blunt needle can be changed simply by replacing it with a new one, even while the device is in the vagina of a cow. The needle guidance system is incorporated into a new OPU device together with the transducer of an ultrasonographic scanner with an unilateral orientated scanning field, making it possible to utilize the needle length to its maximum. This combination permits easy manipulation of the ovaries, easy positioning of follicles on the puncture line, and enables the use of shorter needles which directly enter the scanned area without loss of useful needle length. As a preliminary result we obtained an overall oocyte recovery rate of 42 %. Although this is promising, additional puncture sessions are needed to establish more consistent recovery rates.

40|$|Laparoscopic gastric {{surgeries}} {{are routinely}} performed {{with use of}} a nasogastric tube to decompress the upper gastrointestinal tract. A distended upper gastrointestinal tract can complicate successful laparoscopic gastric surgery as the distention compromises not only the visual field but also the laparoscopic manipulation of the stomach. Since nasogastric intubation is not without risks, we have attempted laparoscopic-assisted gastric cancer surgeries without nasogastric tubes. In this article we describe a simple method of aspirating gastric contents using a 9 cm long 19 -gauge needle inserted percutaneously during laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy. First, a 9 cm long 19 -gauge <b>disposable</b> <b>needle</b> was introduced through the abdominal wall. This needle was then introduced to the stomach through the anterior wall and the stomach gases and fluids were aspirated by connecting the needle to suction. Thus, a collapsed upper gastrointestinal tract was easily obtained. We performed this procedure instead of nasogastric decompression on twenty-two patients with gastric cancer who underwent laparoscopic-assisted distal subtotal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection. The results were good with only one patient experiencing wound infection (4. 5 %) and one patient with postoperative acalculus cholecystitis (4. 5 %). There were no patients with either intraabdominal infection or anastomotic leakage {{and none of the}} patients needed postoperative nasogastric decompression, except the patient who experienced acaculus cholecystitis. Percutaneous needle aspiration is a very simple and efficient technique with little risk of postoperative complications.

40|$|INTRODUCTION : Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology is well {{established}} technique for evaluation of epithelial tumors for many years. Now it has gained its reputation in the diagnostic work up of soft tissue tumors as well. In o ur study we assessed a total of 252 cases of soft tissue tumors by Fine Needle aspiration cytology {{during a period of}} two years 2009 - 2011 and the patients were followed up for biopsies for histopathological correlation. The initial diagnosis of many mass lesions, both superficial and deep - seated, can often be readily and safely assessed by FNAC. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: 1. To study the age, sex and site - wise distribution of soft tissue tumors. 2. To assess the role of Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology in diagnos ing various types of soft tissue tumors. 3. To assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and overall histological correlation percentage of Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology in diagnosing soft tissue tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aspirations were done using a 22 gauge <b>disposable</b> <b>needle</b> and a 10 c. c disposable syringe for suction. Wet - fixed smears with isopropyl alcohol were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Dry - fixed smears were stained with May - Grunwald Giemsa were stud ied for cytological details and diagnosis. The excised surgical specimen and biopsies of the above cases were processed routinely and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. RESULTS: Total 252 cases were studied from Aug 2009 to July 2011 retrospectively. Out of these we received excised specimen and biopsies for 216 cases. Rema i ning 36 cases were excluded in our study as we could not trace the patient for biopsies. 180 were diagnosed as benign soft tissue tumors, while 36 were diagnosed as malignant on cytolog ical examination. The median age of benign soft tissue tumors was 35 years, while that of malignant soft tissue tumors was 40 years. Prevalence was highest in the age group of 21 - 40 years, during which majority were benign lesions. Soft tissue tumors were m ore common in the lower extremities with predominant benign tumors, while malignant tumors were more common in the trunk. Sex wise distribution showed a male: female ratio of 1. 18 : 1, indicating that they were more common in males. The most common tumors we re lipomas, followed by Hemangiomas and peripheral nerve sheath tumors. A comparative analysis was done between the cytology report and histopathology. CONCLUSION: Final evaluation of the results showed that the diagnostic accuracy of FNAC of soft tissue t umors according to the present study was 95. 37...|$|E

40|$|A simple {{device is}} described, {{consisting}} of 12 weighted 23 gauge <b>disposable</b> <b>needles</b> (0. 2 to 5. 2 g), for testing sensation in busy diabetic clinics. The pinprick sensory threshold (PPT) is the lightest weighted needle which consistently elicits a sharp sensation. The subjects were 48 healthy controls (hospital staff), 44 diabetic patients without neuropathic symptoms, and 35 diabetic {{patients with chronic}} painful neuropathy. In the controls, the mean PPT from the right hand and foot obtained on two test occasions a week apart did not differ significantly. In diabetic patients without symptomatic neuropathy, the mean PPT in the right hand and right foot {{were significantly higher than}} in the controls. The diabetic patients with painful neuropathy had clearly increased mean PPT in the right hand and foot compared with controls. Marstock thermal limen in diabetic patients with painful neuropathy correlated significantly with PPT determinations. PPT and thermal thresholds probably give comparable information on small fibre dysfunction in diabetic patients with symptomatic neuropathy. Compared with thermal threshold determinations however, the weighted needle apparatus is inexpensive, simple, and rapid to use...|$|R
