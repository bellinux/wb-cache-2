25|$|Splitboard: A {{snowboard}} which splits <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise,</b> {{and allows}} the bindings to be quickly connected to hinges aligning them longitudinally on the board, allowing the halves of the boards to function as cross country skis. Used with removable skins {{on the base of}} the board, which easily slide forward on snow but not backwards, they allow a snowboard to easily travel into the backcountry. Once the rider is ready to descend, the board halves can simply be joined back together.|$|E
25|$|Group Q5-2 {{features}} a large block of cut limestone {{that may have}} functioned as the base for a stela. The group is also notable for a small cave underneath the principal structure. Near the cave entrance was found a large shell that had been cut <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> in order {{to serve as a}} scribe's inkwell, as illustrated in Maya art. Because of this inkwell, the excavators have interpreted this group as the residence of a scribe. The group has been dated to the Late Classic.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} use chicken mash for feed. A {{plastic pipe}} {{can be cut}} <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> to make two troughs {{which can be used}} as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).|$|E
5000|$|The covered bridge {{rests on}} the {{original}} stone abutments, which have since been reinforced with concrete made of cement. The bridge deck is made of crosswise planking, overlaid with runners <b>in</b> the western <b>half</b> and <b>lengthwise</b> planking <b>in</b> the eastern <b>half.</b> The {{upper part of the}} portals and the clapboard siding is made of pine boards, and stops 3 ft below the roof line. Although the bridge was painted red as part of its 1998 restoration, in 1964 it was described as unpainted, and {{it does not seem to}} have been painted in 1980, as the NRHP nomination form describes how [...] "its rough horizontal siding ... helps this small bridge blend into the surrounding forest". The roof was originally covered with wooden shingles. The bridge does not have parapets and has [...] "no steel reinforcements".|$|R
5000|$|The Vehicle Machine pairs (HyoRyu and EnRyu, FuRyu and RaiRyu) {{can perform}} Symmetrical Docking, {{combining}} {{to form a}} <b>lengthwise</b> <b>half</b> of a larger robot. This is similar in concept to Blue Raker and Green Raker's combination to form Ultra Raker in Brave Exkaiser.|$|R
50|$|Any {{line through}} a {{triangle}} that splits both the triangle's area and its perimeter <b>in</b> <b>half</b> {{goes through the}} triangle's incenter; every line through the incenter that splits the area <b>in</b> <b>half</b> also splits the perimeter <b>in</b> <b>half.</b> There are either one, two, or three of these lines for any given triangle.|$|R
25|$|A banana split is an ice cream-based dessert. In its classic form it {{is served}} in a long dish called a boat. A banana is cut <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> (hence the split) and laid in the dish. There are many variations, but the classic banana split is made with scoops of vanilla, {{chocolate}} and strawberry ice cream {{served in a}} row between the split banana. Although the banana as an exotic fruit {{was introduced to the}} American public in the 1880s, it was later in 1904, that the banana split was invented in the town of Latrobe, Pennsylvania by 23-year-old pharmacy apprentice David Strickler, who was inspired to create a new sundae after seeing a soda jerk during a visit to Atlantic City. According to The Food Chronology, written in 1995 by James Trager, Strickler concocted his sundae to include three scoops of ice cream on a split banana, topped with chocolate syrup, marshmallow, nuts, whipped cream, and a cherry that sold for a dime. Other soda jerks soon imitated Strickler's banana split, albeit in other forms.|$|E
500|$|Immature fruiting {{bodies of}} L.periphragmoides start as round or oval [...] "eggs" [...] {{that may be}} up to [...] in diameter. On the {{underside}} of the egg are whitish rhizomorphs that anchor it to the substrate. The peridium is white to buff-colored on the external surface, and has a gelatinous layer inside. An egg cut <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> reveals internal layers, including a tough white outer peridium, and a thick layer of firm, translucent, gelatinous matter transversed by strands (trabeculae) of denser white tissue. The strands are anastomosing partitions, connecting with the peridium externally and with the bars of the receptaculum within. The gelatinous layer is therefore divided up into many irregular longitudinal chambers.|$|E
2500|$|Split-spoon / SPT Sampler. Utilized in the 'Standard Test Method for Standard Penetration Test (SPT) and Split-Barrel Sampling of Soils' (ASTM D 1586). This sampler is {{typically}} an 18"-30" [...] long, 2.0" [...] outside diameter (OD) hollow tube split <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise.</b> A hardened metal drive shoe with a 1.375" [...] opening {{is attached to}} the bottom end, and a one-way valve and drill rod adapter at the sampler head. It is driven into the ground with a [...] hammer falling 30". [...] The blow counts (hammer strikes) required to advance the sampler a total of 18" [...] are counted and reported. Generally used for non-cohesive soils, samples taken this way are considered disturbed.|$|E

25|$|A {{very simple}} {{example of this}} type is an {{algorithm}} that cuts a string <b>in</b> <b>half,</b> then cuts the right <b>half</b> <b>in</b> <b>half,</b> and so on. It will take O(log n) time (n being {{the length of the}} string) since we chop the string <b>in</b> <b>half</b> before each print (we make the assumption that console.log and str.substring run in constant time).|$|R
50|$|Guests {{must ask}} KAT-TUN a Yes or No {{question}} that splits the group <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>in</b> {{order to receive}} a delicious food prize. The guests have 3 chances but usually KAT-TUN is lenient and splits <b>in</b> <b>half</b> so the guest can receive their present.|$|R
2500|$|Several {{methods are}} used for killing {{lobsters}}. [...] The most common way of killing lobsters is by placing them live in boiling water, sometimes after having been placed in a freezer {{for a period of}} time. [...] Another method is to split the lobster or sever the body <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise.</b> Lobsters may also be killed or rendered insensate immediately before boiling by a stab into the brain (pithing), in the belief that this will stop suffering. However, a lobster's brain operates from not one but several ganglia and disabling only the frontal ganglion does not usually result in death. The boiling method is illegal in some places, such as in Reggio Emilia, Italy, where offenders face fines up to €495. Lobsters can be killed by electrocution prior to cooking, with one device, the CrustaStun, applying a 110-volt, 2 to 5 amp electrical charge to the animal.|$|E
60|$|So it {{was that}} Kwan-Yung-jin travelled. The headmen of the village were cringingly afraid of him, and for good reason, as we were not overlong in finding out. I stepped forward as interpreter, for already I had the hang of several score of Korean words. He scowled and waved me aside. But what did I reek? I was as tall as he, outweighed him by a full two stone, and my skin was white, my hair golden. He turned his back and {{addressed}} the head man of the village while his six silken satellites made a cordon between us. While he talked more soldiers from the ship carried up several shoulder-loads of inch-planking. These planks were about six feet long and two feet wide, and curiously split <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise.</b> Nearer one end than {{the other was a}} round hole larger than a man's neck.|$|E

5000|$|The general {{assembly}} hereby establishes a recommended procedure for the folding {{of the state}} flag by two people. The procedure is as follows:With the flag unfolded, fold the flag <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> so that the points of the flag are aligned. Fold the flag <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> a second time to form a long strip with the red disc facing the ground. Next, fold the pointed end back onto itself to form a rectangle. These steps entail three folds.Starting on the end formed by the fold of the pointed end back onto itself, fold two inches of the flag onto itself for a flag with a three-foot hoist and a five-foot fly, or another appropriate width of fold for a flag of a different size. Repeat the folds a total of fourteen times, alternating the folds in a fan-like manner.The result is a total of seventeen folds symbolizing that Ohio was the seventeenth state admitted to the Union. Finally, neatly and snugly wrap the remaining length of flag around the fan-folds to form a compact rectangle.|$|E
50|$|While most puffballs are not poisonous, some often look {{similar to}} young agarics, {{especially}} the deadly Amanitas, {{such as the}} death cap or destroying angel mushrooms. It {{is for this reason}} that all puffballs gathered in mushroom hunting are cut <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise.</b> Young puffballs in the edible stage, before maturation of the gleba, have undifferentiated white flesh within; whereas the gills of immature Amanita mushrooms can be seen if they are closely examined.|$|E

50|$|A {{very simple}} {{example of this}} type is an {{algorithm}} that cuts a string <b>in</b> <b>half,</b> then cuts the right <b>half</b> <b>in</b> <b>half,</b> and so on. It will take O(log n) time (n being {{the length of the}} string) since we chop the string <b>in</b> <b>half</b> before each print (we make the assumption that console.log and str.substring run in constant time).This means, in order {{to increase the number of}} prints, we have to double the length of the string.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to their legendary tacos, Chico's Tacos are also known for their unique hot dogs. Unlike hotdogs commonly served in America, this menu item is served on a hamburger bun with two franks sliced <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise,</b> topped with their chili, mustard, and pickles. Couple that with a side of crinkle cut fries (that some say taste best with Chico's special tomato sauce and a topping of cheese) makes for another tasty legend at Chico's Tacos.|$|E
