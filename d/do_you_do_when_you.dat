50|$|In 1970 Arik Einstein, Shalom Hanoch and The Churchills {{created a}} new Israeli sound, {{influenced}} by Anglo-American Rock n' Roll. The album Shablul, in which Hanoch composed all the songs, pioneered this new sound. One of the best-known songs from this album was Ma Ata Ose KsheAta Kam Baboker (What <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Wake Up in the Morning). The Churchills, who played {{on most of the}} songs, was a band influenced by the Psychedelic rock of the late 1960s, and this kind of psychedelia appeared in some of their songs. Shablul's lyrics were another expression of musical innovation and changes in Israeli music. The words were written in popular rather than official and formal language, as was used in Israeli songs before. Along with the extraordinary lyrics, one old-style song was in the album - HaBalada Al Yoel Moshe Salomon (The Ballad About Yoel Moshe Salomon).|$|E

5000|$|Khan {{stated in}} July 2012 that, after she {{returned}} home in March 2010 from touring in support of Two Suns (2009), she tried to rehabilitate herself to rebuild a sense of who she was without the music. In May 2010, Khan stated that although she had enough songs to put out as an album, she wanted to take more time working on new material, {{as she had been}} on tour for a long time, and found it boring to write songs about being on tour. She experienced a [...] "profound writer's block", which led her to call Thom Yorke, lead singer of Radiohead, to ask, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> feel like you're going to die because you can't write anything?" [...] He advised her to draw, and subsequently Khan took life-drawing classes and a children's illustration course. Combined with intensive dance classes to boost her confidence, Khan began to feel inspiration enough to begin writing again, penning the album's opening song, [...] "Lilies", which she said was inspired by a scene in the 1970 film Ryan's Daughter.|$|E
