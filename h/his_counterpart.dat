5|$|As the Insurgency's plan failed, Batman convinces <b>his</b> <b>counterpart</b> {{to recruit}} the prime Superman. When open {{war between the}} Regime and Insurgency erupts, Ares (J. G. Hertzler) teleports Wonder Woman to Themyscira and reveals that Superman plans to have the Amazons invade Metropolis. After {{defeating}} her counterpart, Wonder Woman convinces the Amazons to help the Insurgency. An army led by the alternate Aquaman attacks Metropolis, where the insurgents and the Amazons fight them off. Prime Superman defeats powerful regime enforcers, including Doomsday (Khary Payton), and engages in a final confrontation against <b>his</b> <b>counterpart</b> at the Fortress of Solitude, where he emerges victorious, ending {{the reign of the}} High Councillor.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, Morris was {{promoted}} to president of Pixar, while <b>his</b> <b>counterpart</b> at Disney Animation, general manager Andrew Millstein, was also promoted to president of that studio. Both continue to report to Catmull, who retains the title of president of both Disney Animation and Pixar.|$|E
5|$|After the High Councillor's {{downfall}} and the regime's {{defeat in}} Metropolis, the Regime is dismantled {{and all of}} its accomplices are arrested. Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern hands over <b>his</b> <b>counterpart</b> and Sinestro to the Guardians of the Universe to stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart. The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, he might have done the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never has to learn what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever happens to him, causing him to go down the path of <b>his</b> <b>counterpart,</b> he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E

Wright and Denis Irwin missed their penalties; the decisive penalty, taken by Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman, was saved by his {{opposite}} number, Peter Schmeichel. Arsenal manager George Graham admitted his surprise over how the game was decided and thought both clubs would share the trophy; <b>his</b> <b>counterpart</b> Alex Ferguson, though delighted with his team's victory, felt the sudden death aspect was unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|However, pay {{would have}} been much more {{attractive}} in higher-grade units. The top of the pay pyramid were the scholae elite cavalry regiments. Next came palatini units, then comitatenses, and finally limitanei. There is little evidence about the pay differentials between grades. But that they were substantial is shown by the example that an actuarius (quartermaster) of a comitatus regiment was paid 50% more than <b>his</b> <b>counterpart</b> in a pseudocomitatensis regiment.|$|E
5|$|McClellan then {{resisted}} the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while <b>his</b> <b>counterpart</b> General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders {{to move the}} Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.|$|E
50|$|In the Age of Apocalypse, Victor von Doom is {{an agent}} of the Human High Council and the Head of Security. His facial scar {{is the result of a}} mutant {{uprising}} in Latveria.

5|$|De Grasse had {{notified}} <b>his</b> <b>counterpart</b> in Newport, the Comte de Barras Saint-Laurent, of {{his intentions}} and his planned arrival date. Barras sailed from Newport on 27 August with 8 ships of the line, 4 frigates, and 18 transports carrying French armaments and siege equipment. He deliberately sailed via a circuitous route {{in order to}} minimize the possibility of an encounter with the British, should they sail from New York in pursuit. Washington and Rochambeau, in the meantime, had crossed the Hudson on 24 August, leaving some troops behind as a ruse to delay any potential move on the part of General Clinton to mobilize assistance for Cornwallis.|$|E

5|$|From about 1498, {{power in}} Moldavia quietly shifted toward {{a group of}} boyars and administrators, comprising, among others, Luca Arbore and Ioan Tăutu. Stephen's son and co-ruler, Bogdan, was also taking on princely {{responsibilities}} from his father. He conducted the negotiations with Poland about a peace treaty. The treaty, which Stephen ratified at Hârlău in 1499, {{put an end to}} Polish suzerainty over Moldavia. Stephen again stopped paying tribute to the Ottomans in 1500, although by then his health had declined. In February 1501, his delegation arrived in Venice, asking for a specialist doctor. As reported by Marin Sanudo, his envoys also discussed the possibility of Moldavia and Hungary joining the Ottoman–Venetian War. The Doge of Venice, Agostino Barbarigo, sent a physician, Matteo Muriano, to Moldavia to treat <b>his</b> <b>counterpart.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1956 he {{attended}} the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. In the course of discussing a small nuclear warhead for the Mark 45 torpedo, he started a discussion {{on the possibility of}} developing a physically small one-megaton nuclear warhead for the Polaris missile. <b>His</b> <b>counterpart</b> in the discussion, J. Carson Mark from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, at first insisted it could not be done. However, Dr. Mark eventually stated that a half-megaton warhead of small enough size could be developed. This yield, roughly thirty times that of the Hiroshima bomb, was enough for Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke, who was present in person, and Navy strategic missile development shifted from Jupiter to Polaris {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|In New York Bond meets up with <b>his</b> <b>counterpart</b> in the CIA, Felix Leiter. The two visit some of Mr Big's nightclubs in Harlem, but are captured. Bond is interrogated by Mr Big, {{who uses}} his fortune-telling employee, Solitaire (so named because she {{excludes}} men from her life), {{to determine if}} Bond is telling the truth. Solitaire lies to Mr Big, supporting Bond's cover story. Mr Big decides to release Bond and Leiter, and has one of Bond's fingers broken. On leaving, Bond kills several of Mr Big's men, while Leiter is released with minimal physical harm by a gang member, sympathetic because of a shared appreciation of jazz.|$|E

5|$|Montagu joined Warwick in escorting the chariot of six {{horses in}} the funeral cortege {{conveying}} the mortal remains of their father and brother from Pontefract Castle to the family mausoleum at Bisham Abbey, on 14–15 February 1463. On 6 May he was appointed Warden of the Eastern March; Warwick was <b>his</b> <b>counterpart</b> on the western marches. Later that year, he led an expedition to Norham Castle, which had been besieged by the Scots for the previous eighteen days, and relieved it on 26 July; {{this was followed by}} a Chevauchée into Scotland which only ceased when Montagu's force ran out of supplies.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Henry's {{coronation}} Gerard {{was appointed}} to the recently vacant see of York, and became embroiled in the long-running dispute between York and the see of Canterbury concerning which archbishopric had primacy over England. Gerard managed to secure papal recognition of York's claim to jurisdiction over the church in Scotland, but he was forced to agree to a compromise with <b>his</b> <b>counterpart</b> at Canterbury, Anselm, over Canterbury's claims to authority over York, although it was not binding on his successors. In the Investiture Controversy between the king and the papacy over the right to appoint bishops, Gerard worked on reconciling the claims of the two parties; the controversy was finally resolved in 1107.|$|E

Both Millstein and Morris continue to report to Catmull, who retains the title of president of both studios.|$|E
5|$|After a 91-minute rain delay, the offenses {{fought back}} and forth, scoring run after run in an up-and-down affair in Philadelphia. Ryan Howard ended his home run drought, hitting his first round-tripper {{since the end}} of September. Chase Utley and Carlos Ruiz also hit home runs for the Phillies, while Carl Crawford and Dioner Navarro contributed a double each for the Rays. Philadelphia starter Jamie Moyer turned in his first strong {{performance}} of the post-season, allowing three runs over 6⅓ innings. <b>His</b> <b>counterpart</b> Matt Garza allowed four runs over six innings, but neither would factor in the decision. After the Rays tied the game {{in the top of the}} eighth, the Phillies loaded the bases on two intentional walks with Eric Bruntlett on third base. Even with a five-man infield, Ruiz was still able to engineer some late-game heroics, sneaking a dribbling ground ball down the third base line to score Bruntlett. Philadelphia took a 21 series lead.|$|E
5|$|Although David James {{remained}} as England's starting goalkeeper in a 2–2 draw against Austria {{in the first}} 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match, Robinson started every subsequent match, keeping six clean sheets in nine competitive appearances, with a further three in seven friendly matches before the tournament. At the World Cup finals in Germany, Robinson was named in England's World Cup squad and was ever-present in England's campaign, keeping clean sheets in {{four out of five}} matches that he played. After the opening World Cup match against Paraguay, when <b>his</b> <b>counterpart</b> Justo Villar was injured seven minutes into the match, Robinson sent Villar his gloves as a gesture of goodwill. England had won the match 1–0. In addition to the clean sheet against Paraguay, he kept one in the group match against Trinidad and Tobago, although he drew criticism for making errors on crosses. Following England's progression from the group stage, he kept a clean sheet against Ecuador in the round of 16.
