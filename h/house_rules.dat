25|$|Standing {{committees}} are {{established at the}} time that the rules of the House are adopted or by amending the <b>House</b> <b>Rules.</b> The jurisdiction of each standing committee is specified in the <b>House</b> <b>Rules.</b> Under the <b>House</b> <b>Rules</b> the chairman and members of standing {{committees are}} selected through a two-step procedure where the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Conference recommends members to serve on Committees, the majority party recommends a Chairman, and the Minority Party recommends a Ranking Member and finally the full House can approve the recommendation of the Party Caucuses.
