40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of a {{fingerprint}} recognition system is to ensure a reliable and accurate user authentication, but {{the security of the}} recognition system itself can be jeopardized by spoof attacks. This study addresses the problem of developing accurate, generalizable, and efficient algorithms for detecting <b>fingerprint</b> <b>spoof</b> attacks. Specifically, we propose a deep convolutional neural network based approach utilizing local patches centered and aligned using fingerprint minutiae. Experimental results on three public-domain LivDet datasets (2011, 2013, and 2015) show that the proposed approach provides state-of-the-art accuracies in <b>fingerprint</b> <b>spoof</b> detection for intra-sensor, cross-material, cross-sensor, as well as cross-dataset testing scenarios.

Additionally, two new fingerprint presentation attack datasets containing more than 20, 000 images, using two different fingerprint readers, and over 12 different spoof fabrication materials are collected.

40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} render a {{biometric}} system robust against malicious tampering, {{it is important}} to understand the different types of attack and their impact as observed by the liveness and matching scores. In this study, we consider zero-effort impostor attack (referred to as the Z-attack), nonzero-effort impostor attack such as presentation attack or spoofing (S-attack), and other categories of attack involving tampering at the template level (U- and T-attacks). In order to elucidate the impact of all possible attacks, we (1) introduce the concepts of source of origin and symmetric biometric matchers, and (2) subsequently group the attacks into four categories. These views not only improve the understanding of the nature of different attacks but also turn out to ease the design of the classification problem. Following this analysis, we design a novel classification scheme that can take full advantage of the attack-specific data characteristics. Two realisations of the scheme, namely, a mixture of linear classifiers, and a Gaussian Copula-based Bayesian classifier, turn out to outperform a strong baseline classifier based on SVM, as supported by <b>fingerprint</b> <b>spoofing</b> experiments.

New unseen materials continuously challenge state-of-the-art spoofing detectors, suggesting for additional systematic approaches to target anti-spoofing. By incorporating liveness scores into the biometric fusion process, recognition accuracy can be enhanced, but traditional sum-rule based fusion algorithms {{are known to be}} highly sensitive to single spoofed instances. This paper investigates 1 -median filtering as a spoofing-resistant generalised alternative to the sum-rule targeting the problem of partial multibiometric spoofing where m out of n biometric sources to be combined are attacked. Augmenting previous work, this paper investigates the dynamic detection and rejection of liveness-recognition pair outliers for spoofed samples in true multi-modal configuration with its inherent challenge of normalisation. As a further contribution, bootstrap aggregating (bagging) classifiers for fingerprint spoof-detection algorithm is presented.

Hence came the first security system using passwords, these systems have evolved and started using biometrics traits instead of passwords. But people have found ways to cheat such systems through different means. There have been many methods to prevent this security vulnerability, but these methods are very complex or not easy to implement. The most commonly used biometric trait for verification and also the most spoofed biometric trait is fingerprint. The need is to find an easy way to detect a fake fingerprint. The proposed system uses fingerprint and the photo of the fingernail when light is passed through is taken. The image of the fingernail is processed and features are extracted using SIFT and compared with feature vector stored in the database. The correlation is then calculated. Based on the correlation the system decides whether the fingerprint is fake or not. The system was found to react positively to intensity changes in the fingernail image and difference in the pattern of the fingernail. This system provides a simple and robust method for detection of <b>fingerprint</b> <b>spoofing...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{presentation}} attack {{consists in}} submitting to the ﬁngerprint capture device an artiﬁcial {{replica of the}} ﬁnger of the targeted client. If the sensor is not equipped with an appropriate algorithm aimed to detect the <b>ﬁngerprint</b> <b>spoof,</b> the system processes the obtained image as a one belonging to a real ﬁngerprint. In order to face this problem, several presentation attacks detection (PAD) algorithms have been proposed so far. Current methods heavily rely on features extracted from a large data set of fake and real ﬁngerprint images, and an appropriate classiﬁer trained with such data to distinguish between live (real) and fake (<b>spoof)</b> <b>ﬁngerprint</b> images. Building such data set requires a signiﬁcant eﬀort for fabricating samples of fake ﬁngerprints, with the most eﬀective materials used to circumvent the sensor. Interesting and promising results have been obtained, but they also suggest that the PAD is tailored on the particular sensor. Small and signiﬁcant diﬀerences also occur when a novel {{version of the same}} sensor is released, and this may aﬀect the PAD. Therefore, making a PAD interoperable is among the main current issues when considering ﬁngerprints as the ﬁrst level of protection and security of logical or physical resources. This paper is a ﬁrst attempt to assess at which extent the sensor interoperability can be an issue for ﬁngerprint PADs and to eventually propose a solution to this limitation.

40|$|Biometric {{authentication}} is {{now being}} used ubiquitously {{as an alternative to}} passwords on mobile devices. However, current biometric systems are vulnerable to simple spoofing attacks. Several liveness detection methods have been proposed to determine whether there is a live person or an artificial replica in front of the biometric sensor. Yet, the problem is unsolved due to hardship in finding discriminative and computationally inexpensive features for spoofing attacks. Moreover, previous liveness detection approaches are not explicitly aimed for mobile biometric, thus principally unsuited for portable devices. Therefore, we build a software-based multi-biometric prototype that detects face, iris and <b>fingerprint</b> <b>spoofing</b> attacks on mobile devices. We present MoBio_LivDet (Mobile Biometric Liveness Detection), a novel approach that analyzes local features and global structures of the biometric images using a set of low-level feature descriptors and decision level fusion. The system allows user to balance the security level (robustness against spoofing) and convenience that they want. The proposed method is highly fast, simple, efficient, robust and does not require user-cooperation, thus making it extremely apt for mobile devices.

40|$|Fingerprints are a {{non-invasive}} biometric that possess significant advantages. However, {{they are}} subject to surface erosion and damage; distortion upon scanning; and are vulnerable to <b>fingerprint</b> <b>spoofing.</b> The internal fingerprint exists as the undulations of the papillary junction - an intermediary layer of skin - and provides a solution to these disadvantages. Optical coherence tomography is used to capture the internal fingerprint. A depth profile of the papillary junction throughout the OCT scans is first constructed using fuzzy c-means clustering and a fine-tuning procedure. This information is then used to define localised regions over which to average pixels for the resultant internal fingerprint. When compared to a ground-truth internal fingerprint zone, the internal fingerprint zone detected automatically is within the measured bounds of human error. With a mean- squared-error of 21. 3 and structural similarity of 96. 4 %, the internal fingerprint zone was successfully found and described. The extracted fingerprints exceed their surface counterparts with respect to orientation certainty and NFIQ scores (both of which are respected fingerprint quality assessment criteria). Internal to surface fingerprint correspondence and internal fingerprint cross correspondence were also measured. A larger scanned region is shown to be advantageous as internal fingerprints extracted from these scans have good surface correspondence (75 % had at least one true match with a surface counterpart). It is also evidenced that internal fingerprints can constitute a fingerprint database. 96 % of the internal fingerprints extracted had at least one corresponding match with another internal fingerprint. When compared to surface fingerprints cropped to match the internal fingerprints’ representative area and locality, the internal fingerprints outperformed these cropped surface counterparts. The internal fingerprint is an attractive biometric solution. This research develops a novel approach to extracting the internal fingerprint and is an asset to the further development of technologies surrounding fingerprint extraction from OCT scans. No earlier work has extracted or tested the internal fingerprint to the degree that this research has...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of personal verification systems based on fingerprints has shown some security weaknesses. Gian Luca Marcialis, {{assistant professor at the}} Department of electrical and electronic engineering in the University of Cagliari reports on the first international fingerprint liveness detection competition 2009 – LivDet 2009. It is well-known that a fingerprint verification system can be deceived by submitting artificial reproductions of fingerprints made up of silicon or gelatine. In a successful attack, these images are processed as ‘true’ fingerprints, allowing a perpetrator to bypass security. A possible solution in the field of fingerprint verification – especially remote verification – is known as ‘liveness detection’. In this, a standard verification system is coupled with additional hardware or software modules aimed at certifying the authenticity of submitted fingerprints. While hardware-based solutions are the most expensive, software-based ones attempt to measure liveness from characteristics of images themselves by simply applying image processing algorithms. In order to assess the main achievements of fingerprint liveness detection, the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of the University of Cagliari, in cooperation with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University of Clarkson, is holding the first edition of the Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition 2009 (LivDet 2009), which will be held during the 15 th International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing (ICIAP 2009). LivDet 2009 is open to all academic and industrial institutions which have a solution for the software-based fingerprint vitality (or ‘liveness’) detection problem. Each participant is invited to submit its algorithm in a Win 32 console application. The performance will be evaluated by using a very large data set of ‘fake’ and ‘live’ fingerprint images captured with three different optical scanners. The performance rank will be compiled and published and the best algorithm will win the ‘Best Fingerprint Liveness Detection Algorithm Award at ICIAP 2009. Fingerprint liveness detection background The duplication of fingerprints (also known as <b>fingerprint</b> <b>spoofing)</b> has remote origins in some fantasy novels of {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century. Most recently this subject has become the focus of numerous research groups, both academic and industrial. Some of the first studies date back to 2000 and 2002. 1 and 2 These works showed the possibility of fingerprint reproduction and the defrauding of a biometric system. Two different methods were established: With cooperation (1) The user puts his or her finger on a soft material such as Play-Doh, dental impression material or plaster to form the mould (see figure 1). Consensual method – individual places their finger on a soft material. Figure 1. Consensual method – individual places their finger on a soft material. Figure options (2) The negative impression of the fingerprint is fixed on the surface. (3) Silicone liquid or another similar material, such as wax or gelatine, is poured in the mould (see figure 2). Consensual method – the negative impression. Figure 2. Consensual method – the negative impression. Figure options (4) When the liquid is hardened the spoof is formed (figure 3). Consensual method – the stamp with the reproduction of the pattern. Figure 3. Consensual method – the stamp with the reproduction of the pattern. Figure options Without cooperation (1) A latent print left by an unintentional user is enhanced by a powder applied with a brush (figure 4). Unconsensual method – latent print. Figure 4. Unconsensual method – latent print. Figure options (2) The fingerprint is photographed and then the image is printed in negative on a transparency (figure 5). Unconsensual method – mask with the pattern for lithographic process. Figure 5. Unconsensual method – mask with the pattern for lithographic process.

Figure options (5) The thickness of pattern in the copper is the mould for the stamp (see figure 8) Unconsensual method – the negative pattern engraved in the copper. Figure 8. Unconsensual method – the negative pattern engraved in the copper. Figure options (6) For this method, a liquid silicone, such as gelatine or wax, is dripped on the board (figure 9). Unconsensual method – silicon stamp. Figure 9. Unconsensual method – silicon stamp. Figure options When faced with this threat, a biometric device must decide if the finger on the acquisition sensors is alive or fake. In other words, the recognition process must be upgraded with an added function for detecting the ‘vitality’ of the submitted biometric. Due to the difficulty of the task, the first goal is to achieve good ‘liveness’ detection rates when the consensual method is applied. It is worth noting that this method results in the best quality replica and images, since the subject is ‘consensual’. Liveness detection can be performed by adding some additional hardware to the capture device (eg for checking blood pressure, or heartbeat, which are not present in a ‘fake’ finger), thus increasing their cost. A more challenging and difficult solution is to integrate into standard fingerprint sensors some additional algorithm able to detect the ‘liveness’ degree from the captured image. They are so-called ‘software-based’ approaches. For software-based liveness, the question is: Are there biometric ‘liveness’ measurements which can be extracted from captured images? So far, several algorithms for detecting fingerprint liveness have been proposed, 3, 4 and 5 but the main problem is to understand how these algorithms may impact on fingerprint verification systems when integrated. In particular, the objective of this competition is to evaluate various approaches' performance by a shared and well-defined experimental protocol, in order to assess which may be more suitable for the task. Aims The goal of the competition is to compare different methodologies for software-based fingerprint liveness detection with a common experimental protocol and data set. The ambition of the competition is to become the reference event for academic and industrial research. The competition is not defined as an official system for quality certification of the proposed solutions, but rather, it hopes to impact the state of the art in this crucial field, security in biometric systems. Experimental protocol and evaluation Due to the wide variety of current liveness detection algorithms, the competition defines some constraints for the submitted algorithms: • Methods must output, for each image, a ‘liveness degree’ ranging from 0 to 100 (e. g. Posterior probability of ‘true’ class). • A training set of fake and live fingerprint images will be made available to each participant, freely downloadable from the LivDet site after registration. • These images are a small subset of the evaluation data set. • Each submitted algorithm, as a Win 32 console application, must follow the input and output sequence required. Data set The data set for the final evaluation comprises three sub-sets, which contain live and fake fingerprint images from three different optical sensors: Images have been collected consensually and use different materials for the artificial reproduction of the fingerprint (gelatine, silicone, Play-Doh). Algorithm submission Each submitted algorithm must be a Win 32 console application with the following list of parameters: LIVENESS_XYZ. exe [ndataset] [inputfile] [outputfile] DATASET	Scanners	Model No. 	Resolution(dpi) 	Image size Dataset # 1 	Crossmatch	Verifier 300 LC	 500 	 480 × 640 Dataset # 2 	Identix	DFR 2100 	 686 	 720 × 720 Dataset # 3 	Biometrika	FX 2000 	 569 	 312 × 372 Table options DATASET	Live Samples	Fake Samples Dataset # 1 	 1500 	 1500 Dataset # 2 	 2000 	 2000 Dataset # 3 	 2000 	 2000 Table options LIVENESS_XYZ. exe	 It is the executable name, where XYZ is the identification number of the participant.

The output is a posterior probability of the live class given the image, or a degree of ‘liveness’ normalised in the range 0 and 100 (100 is the maximum degree of liveness, 0 means that the image is fake). In the case that the algorithm has not been able to process the image, the correspondent output must be − 1000 (failure to enrol). Table options Each parameter related to the data set configuration must be set before submission. Users can configure their algorithms using the training set available after registration. Only Win 32 console applications with the above characteristics will be accepted for the competition. Participants may also publish the source code of their algorithm, but this is not mandatory. They are also invited to prepare a paper, which will be submitted at the ICIAP conference, with the description of their solution submitted at LivDet. Performance evaluation The parameters adopted for the performance evaluation will be: • Evaluation per sensor – Frej_n: Rate of failure to enrol for the sub-set n. – Fcorrlive_n: Rate of correctly classified live fingerprints for sub-set n. – Fcorrfake_n: Rate of correctly classified fake fingerprints for sub-set n. – Ferrlive_n: Rate of misclassified live fingerprints for sub-set n. – Ferrfake_n: Rate of misclassified fake fingerprints for sub-set n. – ET: Average processing time per image – MAM: Max.

40|$|The main topic ofmy {{research}} {{during these}} three years concerned biometrics {{and in particular}} the Fingerprint Liveness Detection (FLD), namely the recognition of fake <b>fingerprints.</b> <b>Fingerprints</b> <b>spoofing</b> is a topical issue as evidenced by the release of the latest iPhone and Samsung Galaxy models with an embedded fingerprint reader as an alternative to passwords. Several videos posted on YouTube show how to violate these devices by using fake fingerprints which demonstrated how the problemof vulnerability to spoofing constitutes a threat to the existing fingerprint recognition systems. Despite the fact that many algorithms have been proposed so far, none of them showed the ability to clearly discriminate between real and fake fingertips. In my work, after a study of the state-of-the-art I paid a special attention on the so called textural algorithms. I first used the LBP (Local Binary Pattern) algorithm and then I worked on the introduction of the LPQ (Local Phase Quantization) and the BSIF (Binarized Statistical Image Features) algorithms in the FLD field. In the last two years I worked especially on what we called the “user specific” problem. In the extracted features we noticed the presence of characteristic related not only to the liveness but also to the different users. We have been able to improve the obtained results identifying and removing, at least partially, this user specific characteristic.

Liveness detection is an anti-spoofing method {{which can}} detect physiological {{signs of life}} from fingerprints to ensure only live fingers can be captured for enrollment or authentication. Our laboratory has demonstrated that the time-varying perspiration pattern {{can be used as}} a measure to detect liveness for <b>fingerprint</b> systems. Unlike <b>spoof</b> or cadaver fingers, live fingers have a distinctive spatial perspiration phenomenon both statically and dynamically. In this paper, a new intensity based approach is presented which quantifies the grey level differences using histogram distribution statistics and finds distinct differences between live and non-live fingerprint images. Based on these static and dynamic features, we generate the decision rules to perform liveness classification. These methods were tested on optical, capacitive DC and electro-optical scanners using a dataset of about 58 live <b>fingerprints,</b> 50 <b>spoof</b> (made from Play-Doh and Gelatin) and 25 cadaver fingerprints. The dataset was divided into three sets: training set, validation set and test set. The training set was used to generate the classification tree model while the best tree model was decided by the validation set. Finally, the test set was used to estimate the performance. The results are compared with the former ridge signal algorithm with new extracted features. The outcome shows that the intensity based approach and ridge signal approach can extract simple features which perform with excellent classification (about 90 %~ 100 %) for some scanners using a classification tree.

40|$|Abstract—Fingerprint {{scanners}} may be {{susceptible to}} spoofing using artificial materials, {{or in the}} worst case, dismembered fingers. An anti-spoofing method based on liveness detection has been developed for use in fingerprint scanners. This method quantifies a specific temporal perspiration pattern present in fingerprints acquired from live claimants. The enhanced perspi-ration detection algorithm presented here improves our previous work by including other fingerprint scanner technologies; using a larger, more diverse data set; and a shorter time window. Several classification methods were tested in order to separate live and <b>spoof</b> <b>fingerprint</b> images. The dataset included fingerprint images from 33 live subjects, 33 spoofs created with dental material and Play-Doh, and fourteen cadaver fingers. Each method had a different performance with respect to each scanner and time window. However, all the classifiers achieved approximately 90 % classification rate for all scanners, using the reduced time window and the more comprehensive training and test sets.

40|$|Security of {{fingerprint}} authentication systems remains {{threatened by}} the presentation of spoof artifacts. Most cur-rent mitigation approaches rely upon the fingerprint live-ness detection as the main anti-spoofing mechanisms. How-ever, liveness detection algorithms are not robust to sen-sor variations. In other words, typical liveness detection algorithms need to be retrained and adapted {{to each and every}} sensor used for fingerprint capture. In this paper, inspired by popular invariant feature descriptors such as histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and the scale in-variant feature transform (SIFT), we propose a new invari-ant descriptor of fingerprint ridge texture called histograms of invariant gradients (HIG). The proposed descriptor is designed to preserve robustness to variations in gradient positions. <b>Spoofed</b> <b>fingerprints</b> are detected using multi-ple histograms of invariant gradients computed from spa-tial neighborhoods within the fingerprint. Results show that proposed method achieves an average accuracy compara-ble to the best algorithms of the Fingerprint Liveness De-tection Competition 2013, while being applicable with no change to multiple acquisition sensors. 1...|$|R
40|$|Fingerprint {{recognition}} {{systems are}} vulnerable to spoof attacks, which consist in presenting forged fingerprints to the sensor. Typical anti-spoofing mechanism is fingerprint liveness detection. Existing liveness detection methods are still not robust to spoofing materials, datasets and sensor variations. In particular, {{the performance of a}} liveness detection algorithm remarkably drops upon encountering spoof fabrication materials that were not used during the training stage. Likewise, a quintessential liveness detection method needs to be adapted and retrained to new spoofing materials, datasets and each sensor used for acquiring the fingerprints. In this paper, we propose a framework that first performs correlation mapping between live and <b>spoof</b> <b>fingerprints</b> and then uses a discriminative-generative classification scheme for spoof detection. Partial Least Squares (PLS) is utilized to learn the correlations. While, support vector machine (SVM) is combined with three generative classifiers, namely Gaussian Mixture Model, Gaussian Copula, and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, for final classification. Experiments on the publicly available LivDet 2011 and LivDet 2013 datasets, show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods alongside cross-spoof material and cross-sensor technique...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} many advantages, {{multi-modal}} biometric recognition systems {{are vulnerable to}} spoof attacks, which can decrease their level of security. Thus, it is fundamental to understand and analyse the effects of spoof attacks and propose new methods to design robust systems against them. To this aim, we are developing a method based on simulating the fake score distributions of individual matchers, to evaluate the relative robustness of different score fusion rules. We model the score distribution of fake traits by assuming it lies between the one of genuine and impostor scores, and parametrize it by {{a measure of the}} relative distance to the latter, named attack strength. Different values of the attack strength account for the many different factors which can affect the distribution of fake scores. In this paper we present preliminary results aimed at evaluating the capability of our model to approximate realistic fake score distributions. To this aim we use a data set made up of faces and <b>fingerprints,</b> including realistic <b>spoof</b> attacks traits...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies in}} {{biometrics}} have confirmed {{the existence of}} user-specific score characteristics for genuine and zero-effort impostor score distributions. As an important consequence, biometric users contribute disproportionately to the FRR (false reject rate) and FAR (false accept rate) of the system. This phenomena is also know as the Doddington zoo effect. Recent studies indicate the vulnerability of unimodal and multibiometric systems to spoof attacks. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the score characteristics for spoof attacks. Such an analysis will 1) help improve our understanding of the Doddington zoo effect under spoof attacks; and 2) allow us to design biometric classifiers that are more robust to such attacks. The contributions of this paper are as follows: a) examining the existence of user-specific score characteristics for spoof attacks and b) analyzing the correlation between user-specific score characteristics obtained on genuine (as well as zero-effort impostor) and non zero-effort impostor (spoof) score distributions. Experiments conducted on the LivDet 09 <b>spoofed</b> <b>fingerprint</b> database confirms that biometric user-groups exhibit different degrees of vulnerability to spoof attacks as well. Further, moderate negative correlation may exist between users who are difficult to recognize and their vulnerability to spoof attacks. 1...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{utilities}} of biometrics {{in the context of}} crime scene investigation is to identify people. However, in the most sophisticated cases, criminals may introduce the biometric samples of innocent individuals in order to evade their own identities as well as to incriminate the innocent individuals. To date, even a minute suspect of an anti-forensic threat can po-tentially jeopardize any forensic investigation to the point that a potentially vital piece of evidence suddenly becomes pow-erless in the court of law. In order to remedy this situation, we propose an anti-forensic resistant likelihood ratio compu-tation that renders the strength of evidence to a level that is proportional to the trustworthiness of the trace, such that a highly credible evidence will bear its full strength of evidence whilst a highly suspicious trace can have its strength of evi-dence reduced to naught. Using simulation as well as a <b>spoof</b> <b>fingerprint</b> database, we show that the existing likelihood ratio computation is extremely vulnerable to an anti-forensic threat whereas our proposed computation is robust to it, thereby striking the balance between the utility and threat of a trace...|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{image-based}} method using Contourlet transform [5] {{to detect}} liveness in fingerprint biometric systems. We observe that real and <b>spoof</b> <b>fingerprint</b> images exhibit different textural characteristics. Wavelet transform although widely used for liveness detection {{is not the}} ideal one. Wavelets are not very effective in representing images containing lines and contours [5]. Recent Contourlet transform allows representing contours in a more efficient way than the wavelets [5]. Fingerprint is made of only contours of ridges; hence Contourlet transform is more suitable for fingerprint processing than the wavelets. Therefore, we use Contourlet energy and co-occurrence signatures to capture textural intricacies of images. After downsizing features with Plus l – take away r method, we test them on various classifiers: logistic regression, support vector machine and AdTree using our databases consisting of 185 real, 90 Fun-Doh (Play-Doh) and 150 Gummy fingerprint images. We then select the best classifier and use at as a base classifier to form an ensemble classifier obtained by fusing a stack of “K ” base classifiers using the “Majority Voting Rule ” (i. e. bagging). Experimental results indicate that, the new liveness detection approach is very promising as it needs only one fingerprint and no extra hardware to detect vitality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – With the {{new wave}} of affordable, small, and easy to use scanners, fingerprint-based {{biometric}} systems have been receiving an increasing attention. However, a major security concern is the possibility of intrusion by presenting a nonliving finger, be it a duplicate or a severed finger, to an electronic fingerprint scanner in order to gain access to a protected entity. It has been shown that one can <b>spoof</b> <b>fingerprint</b> scanners even with play-doh ® or gummy fingers. In order to circumvent this problem, one can read signals from the presented finger to verify its liveness and thus eliminate the threat of synthesized or cadaver finger attacks. Earlier research has shown that the process of perspiration on the live fingertip skin presents a specific time progression that cannot be seen in cadaver or synthetic fingerprint scans, and thus phenomenon {{can be used as a}} measure of fingerprint liveness. However, the perspiration process demonstrates itself differently on different scanning technologies and thus a scanner-specific approach is needed. In this paper, a new general evolutionary temporal neural network (GETnet) for perspiration-based liveness detection is proposed. It is shown that GETnet can arrive at a succinct solution that performs both feature extraction and classification on the raw fingerprint ridge signals. With the given variety of fingerprint scanners as well as the diversity of their operating conditions, including climate and user demographics, it is more efficient to automatically breed customized solutions for the perspiration-based fingerprint liveness detection through a general framework such as GETnet instead of tailoring feature extractors and classifiers to each and every different scenario...|$|R
40|$|A {{biometric}} system {{is essentially a}} pattern recognition system being used in ad-versarial environment. Since, {{biometric system}} like any conventional security system is exposed to malicious adversaries, who can manipulate data {{to make the system}} ineffective by compromising its integrity. Current theory and de- sign methods of biometric systems do {{not take into account the}} vulnerability to such adversary attacks. Therefore, evaluation of classical design methods is an open problem to investigate whether they lead to design secure systems. In order to make biometric systems secure it is necessary to understand and evalu-ate the threats and to thus develop effective countermeasures and robust system designs, both technical and procedural, if necessary. Accordingly, the extension of theory and design methods of biometric systems is mandatory to safeguard the security and reliability of biometric systems in adversarial environments. In this thesis, we provide some contributions towards this direction. Among all the potential attacks discussed in the literature, spoof attacks are one of the main threats against the security of biometric systems for identity recognition. Multimodal biometric systems are commonly believed to be in-trinsically more robust to spoof attacks than systems based on a single biomet-ric trait, as they combine information coming from different biometric traits. However, recent works have question such belief and shown that multimodal systems can be misled by an attacker (impostor) even by spoofing only one of the biometric traits. Therefore, we first provide a detailed review of state-of-the-art works in multimodal biometric systems against spoof attacks. The scope ofstate-of-the-art results is very limited, since they were obtained under a very restrictive “worst-case” hypothesis, where the attacker is assumed to be able to fabricate a perfect replica of a biometric trait whose matching score distribu-tion is identical to the one of genuine traits. Thus, we argue and investigate the validity of “worst-case” hypothesis using large set of real spoof attacks and provide empirical evidence that “worst-case” scenario can not be representa- ixtive of real spoof attacks: its suitability may depend on the specific biometric trait, the matching algorithm, and the techniques used to counterfeit the spoofed traits. Then, we propose a security evaluation methodology of biometric systems against spoof attacks that can be used in real applications, as it does not require fabricating fake biometric traits, it allows the designer to take into account the different possible qualities of fake traits used by different attackers, and it exploits only information on genuine and impostor samples which is col- lected for the training of a biometric system. Our methodology evaluates the performances under a simulated spoof attack using model of the fake score distribution that takes into account explicitly different degrees of the quality of fake biometric traits. In particular, we propose two models of the match score distribution of fake traits that take into account all different factors which can affect the match score distribution of fake traits like the particular spoofed biometric, the sensor, the algorithm for matching score computation, the technique used to construct fake biometrics, and the skills of the attacker. All these factors are summarized in a single parameter, that we call “attack strength”. Further, we propose extension of our security evaluation method to rank several biometric score fusion rules according to their relative robustness against spoof attacks. This method allows the designer to choose the most robust rule according to the method prediction. We then present empirical analysis, using data sets of face and <b>fingerprints</b> including real <b>spoofed</b> traits, to show that our proposed models provide a good approximation of fake traits’ score distribution and our method thus providing an adequate estimation of the security 1 of biometric systems against spoof attacks. We also use our method to show how to evaluate the security of different multimodal systems on publicly available benchmark data sets without spoof attacks. Our experimental results show that robustness of multimodal biometric systems to spoof attacks strongly depends on the particular matching algorithm, the score fusion rule, and the attack strength of fake traits. We eventually present evidence, considering a multimodal system based on face and fingerprint biometrics, that the proposed methodology to rank score fusion rules is capable of providing correct ranking of score fusion rules under spoof attacks. ...|$|R
