5|$|Critics {{classify}} Little Gidding as a poem of {{fire with}} an emphasis on purgation and the Pentecostal fire. The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter, with attention paid to the arrival of summer. The images of snow, which provoke <b>desires</b> <b>for</b> a spiritual life, transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire, earth, air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four. Following this is a discussion on death and destruction, things unaccomplished, and regret for past events.|$|E

5|$|A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), {{whether for}} {{household}} use or a prayer mat. The pattern {{is made by}} winding the weft threads back over the warp threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' <b>desires</b> <b>for</b> protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E
5|$|At {{independence}} on 30 June 1960, {{the army}} {{suffered from a}} dramatic deficit of trained leaders, particularly in the officer corps. This was because the Force Publique had always only been officered by Belgian or other expatriate whites. The Belgian Government {{made no effort to}} train Congolese commissioned officers until {{the very end of the}} colonial period, and in 1958, only 23 African cadets had been admitted even to the military secondary school. The highest rank available to Congolese was adjutant, which only four soldiers achieved before independence. Though 14 Congolese cadets were enrolled in the Royal Military Academy in Brussels in May, they were not scheduled to graduate as second lieutenants until 1963. Ill-advised actions by Belgian officers led to an enlisted ranks' rebellion on 5 July 1960, which helped spark the Congo Crisis. Lieutenant General Émile Janssens, the Force Publique commander, wrote during a meeting of soldiers that 'Before independence=After Independence', pouring cold water on the soldiers' <b>desires</b> <b>for</b> an immediate raise in their status.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Xu Xiake, who focused on technical aspects in his travel literature, the Chinese poet and official Yuan Hongdao (1568–1610) used travel literature {{to express his}} <b>desires</b> <b>for</b> individualism as well as autonomy from and frustration with Confucian court politics. Yuan desired to free himself from the ethical compromises that were inseparable from the career of a scholar-official. This anti-official sentiment in Yuan's travel literature and poetry was actually following {{in the tradition of}} the Song dynasty poet and official Su Shi (1037–1101). Yuan Hongdao and his two brothers, Yuan Zongdao (1560–1600) and Yuan Zhongdao (1570–1623), were the founders of the Gong'an School of letters. This highly individualistic school of poetry and prose was criticized by the Confucian establishment for its association with intense sensual lyricism, which was also apparent in Ming vernacular novels such as the Jin Ping Mei. Yet even gentry and scholar-officials were affected by the new popular romantic literature, seeking courtesans as soulmates to reenact the heroic love stories that arranged marriages often could not provide or accommodate.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that defensive pessimists use problem-focused coping in stressful situations. The process of coping with stress by defensive pessimists appears to be affected by the <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> control. Therefore, the effect of the <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> control on defensive pessimism, coping and stress response in controllable and uncontrollable situations was investigated. Japanese undergraduate and graduate students (n = 325) participated in the study. Participants reported past stressful events. And they were classified into eight subgroups: those with, or without the perceived controllability of the events, which cognitive strategy to use, and the degree of <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> control. Results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that high <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> control group tended to use problem-focused coping in controllable situation. In uncontrollable situations, defensive pessimists tended to feel stress responses, and especially in low <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> control group, defensive pessimists felt more anxiety than strategic optimists. Additionally, high <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> control group tended to feel anger in uncontrollable situations. These results imply that <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> control effects coping adaptively, and defensive pessimists with low <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> control might not use emotion-focused coping so they feel more anxiety in uncontrollable situations. Although defensive pessimists supposed to have vulnerability to feel stress response easily, they might maintain their health by keeping moderate level of <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> control. The implications and limitations of the present study are discussed...|$|R

Combined with the cultural values of a pre-existing situation, the four wishes give rise to certain attitudes which are subjectively defined meanings and shared experience, strongly emphasised and embodied in specific institutions.|$|R
5|$|After {{a year in}} {{the horse}} cavalry, Parrish became an {{aviation}} cadet in June 1931 and subsequently qualified as an enlisted pilot. He completed flight training in 1932 and was assigned to the 13th Attack Squadron at Fort Crockett, near Galveston, Texas. One year later in September 1933 Parrish joined the Air Corps Technical School at Chanute Field, Illinois; later transferring to the First Air Transport Squadron at Dayton, Ohio. In July 1935 he rejoined the 13th Attack Squadron as assistant operations officer, then located at Barksdale Field, Louisiana. Parrish became a flying instructor at Randolph Field in April 1938, and by July 1939 he was a supervisor at the Air Corps Flying School in Glenview, Illinois. Commissioned as a lieutenant in 1939, Parrish attended the Air Command and Staff School at Maxwell Field, Alabama. As a captain, and still a student at Maxwell, his association with the Tuskegee Airmen began as in March 1941 when he was assigned as Assistant Director of Training of the Eastern Flying Training Command. Upon graduation in June 1941, he chose to remain at Maxwell, and work with the Tuskegee Institute as a primary flight instructor. By doing so, he gave up his own <b>desires</b> <b>for</b> a combat command. On December 5, 1941, two days before the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was promoted to Director of Training at Tuskegee Army Flying School in Alabama, assuming command of Tuskegee Army Air Field a year later, in December 1942.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} co-written by Nanase Ohkawa and Junichi Fujisaku, who also {{worked on the}} series. According to Fujisaku, the {{narrative}} of The Last Dark focused on Saya both seeking revenge and searching for purpose after discovering she was being used by cruel humans. The process of writing The Last Dark ran parallel to Blood-C, and as Ohkawa was preoccupied with the series, Fujisaku put together a basic story and script draft which he expanded and adjusted based on Shiotani's <b>desires</b> <b>for</b> the movie. When Ohkawa, she and Fujisaku together worked to write and polish the final script. Saya's relationships with others despite her non-human status formed {{a key part of}} the movie's themes. According to Ohkawa, one of her main issues was keeping the storytelling as tight as possible within the movie's planned runtime, meaning that some elements of Saya's backstory needed to be cut. While the series took place in a fictional location, the movie used the real-world location of Tokyo, so Ohkawa took extra care to insert realistic details into the script. She found it difficult accommodating the wishes of both Shiotani and Fujisaku's ideas alongside her own in the script.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} time perspective and <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> control in self-reported substance use and to test for a moderating effect of <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> control in the relation between time perspective and substance use. Procedure: A random sample of 240 persons, aged 15 years and over, selected in various public spaces in an urban region in central France. Main outcome measures: Time perspective was measured using subscales of the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI, Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999), <b>Desire</b> <b>for</b> control was measured using a translated version of the <b>Desire</b> <b>for</b> Control Scale (DCS, Burger & Cooper, 1979), and substance use was self-reported. Results: After controlling for age and gender, significant links were found between time perspective and substance use. <b>Desire</b> <b>for</b> control {{did not appear to}} be directly related to substance use. The interaction effect between TP and <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> control appeared to be related to substance use. There was evidence that the relation between TP and substance use is buffered by low <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> control. Conclusion: This study converges with previous studies demonstrating the relation between TP and substance use, but provides evidence of the moderating role played by <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> control. <b>Desire</b> <b>for</b> control thus appears as worthy of interest in the analysis of self-regulatory process, and further research on the links between TP and various aspects of control is required. In order to be more effective, the design of future studies and interventions based on time-related issues should consider how <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> control plays a part in establishing vulnerability profiles...|$|R
