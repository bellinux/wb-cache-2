In DrumLine Battle, drum lines of up to 30 marching members (no grounded percussion) compete in head-to-head judged competition. The competitions may be held either live and face-to-face or online, allowing groups {{from all over the world}} to compete against each other. Judging criteria is not restricted to technical proficiency, but includes showmanship and attitude. In 2014, the drum line from E-Sarn, one of Thailand's top drum and bugle corps, traveled to Indianapolis to compete in the DrumLine Battle contest held during DCI Championship week and defeated the drum lines from 15 U.S. drum corps and marching bands. One of the other 2014 competitors in Indianapolis was the River City Rhythm drum line from Minnesota which transitioned into the River City Rhythm Drum and Bugle Corps and entered into DCI Open Class competition in 2015.|$|E

2500|$|Tension between Wayne and American rapper, Pusha T, {{had been}} <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> {{beginning}} soon after Clipse and Birdman worked on [...] "What Happened to That Boy", the latter's 2002 single. In 2006, Wayne felt the Clipse song [...] "Mr. Me Too" [...] {{was directed at}} him which caused more tension between the two. In 2012 after much speculation that Pusha T was subliminally dissing Canadian rapper and Wayne's Young Money signee Drake in several songs, the speculation heightened {{after the release of}} Pusha T's [...] "Exodus 23:1" [...] song. Lil Wayne quickly responded on online social networking service Twitter and later released a diss track titled [...] "Goulish". In the first verse Wayne raps [...] "Fuck Pusha T and anybody that love him / His head up his ass, I'mma have to head-butt him". Pusha T has called Wayne's diss track [...] "horrible" [...] and said he felt it didn't deserve a response. Both men have downplayed the feud, with Wayne saying he's over it. However, in late November, Pusha T dissed Wayne and Birdman on a new Ludacris song titled [...] "Tell Me What They Mad For". However, once the feud between Lil Wayne and Birdman arose, Pusha T sent out a tweet encouraging Lil Wayne to sign to G.O.O.D. Music, which also insulted Birdman for his hand-rubbing habit.|$|E

This {{has been}} <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> When Giulia was married by old Tommaso, {{whom she had}} never seen in her life before the betrothal, the first thing she did was {{to fall in love with}} Giorgio. He fell in love with her, but being a fairly honest sort of man, he had some scruples about {{committing}} adultery with his cousin's wife, especially as he lived on his cousin's money. However, when a woman is vicious, a man's scruples soon go to the devil. If Adam couldn't refuse the apple, you can't expect us poor fallen creatures to do so either. The result was that Joseph did not run away from Potiphar's wife so fast as to prevent her from catching him.' ...|$|E

"It {{had been}} <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> down there," [...] said Low, {{pointing}} to a cavity from which the fresh water now slowly welled, [...] "but it had been quickened by the rising of the subterranean springs and rivers which always occurs at a certain stage of the dry season. I remember that on that very night--for it happened a little after midnight, when all sounds are more audible--I was troubled and oppressed in my sleep by {{what you would call}} a nightmare; a feeling as if I was kept down by bonds and pinions that I longed to break. And then I heard a crash in this direction, and the first streak of morning brought me the sound and scent of water. Six months afterwards I chanced to find my way here, as I told you, and gave it your name. I did not dream that I should ever stand beside it with you, and have you christen it yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|Entering into details, {{after that}} ominous reply, Mr. Wellwood did not {{hesitate}} to say that his patient's nerves were completely shattered. Disease of the brain had, as he feared, been already set up. [...] "As to the causes which have produced this lamentable break-down," [...] the doctor continued, [...] "Mr. Gracedieu has been in the habit of preaching extempore twice a day on Sundays, and sometimes in the week as well--and has uniformly refused to spare himself when he was in most urgent need of rest. If you have ever attended his chapel, you have seen a man in a state of fiery enthusiasm, feeling intensely every word that he utters. Think of such exhaustion as that implies <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> together, and accumulating its wasting influences on a sensitively organized constitution. Add that he is tormented by personal anxieties, which he confesses to no one, not even to his own children and the sum of it all is that a worse case of its kind, I am grieved to say, has never occurred in my experience." ...|$|E
60|$|Altogether {{over four}} {{thousand}} wolves were slain. All those whose coats were {{in good condition}} were skinned, the skins being valuable for linings to the huts, for beds, and winter mantles. Many men had been bitten more or less severely by them, but none had been killed; and there was much rejoicing at the complete clearance from the district of a foe that had, since {{the arrival of the}} large packs from the north, made terrible inroads among the herds of cattle and swine, and had killed a considerable number of men, women, and children. The previous winter had been a very severe one, and had driven great numbers of wolves down from North Britain. The fighting that had been <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> in the south and west, and at times in the midlands, had put a stop to the usual chases of wolves in those districts, and they had consequently multiplied exceedingly and had become a serious scourge even before the arrival of the fresh bands from the north. However, after so great a slaughter it was hoped that for a time at least they would not again make their appearance in that neighbourhood.|$|E

60|$|I have {{explained}} how {{the ideas of}} a trained aristocracy and a universal education grew to paramount importance in my political scheme. It is but a short step from this {{to the question of}} the quantity and quality of births in the community, and from that again to these forbidden and fear-beset topics of marriage, divorce, and the family organisation. A sporadic discussion of these aspects had been <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> a Eugenic society existed, and articles on the Falling Birth Rate, and the Rapid Multiplication of the Unfit were staples of the monthly magazines. But beyond an intermittent scolding of prosperous childless people in general--one never addressed them in particular--nothing was done towards arresting those adverse processes. Almost against my natural inclination, I found myself forced to go into these things. I came to the conclusion that under modern conditions the isolated private family, based on the existing marriage contract, was failing in its work. It wasn't producing enough children, and children good enough and well trained enough for the demands of the developing civilised state. Our civilisation was growing outwardly, and decaying in its intimate substance, and unless it was presently to collapse, some very extensive and courageous reorganisation was needed. The old haphazard system of pairing, qualified more and more by worldly discretions, no longer secures a young population numerous enough or good enough for the growing needs and possibilities of our Empire. Statecraft sits weaving splendid garments, no doubt, but with a puny, ugly, insufficient baby in the cradle.|$|E
