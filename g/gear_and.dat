Half-inch (12.7mm) steel plating was added to protect her steering <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> her interior cabin bulkheads and glass ventilators were removed to reduce damage from splinters. Her furniture was removed {{to make room for}} the mess decks needed to feed large numbers of troops and sailors and an operating room and sickbay were installed amidships.|$|E
40|$|Fisheries {{legislation}} in Uganda {{has not been}} feasibly applicable to all Uganda water bodies and species therein. Failure to make appropriate legislation to regulate fishing <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> methods {{has led to the}} decline or near collapse of some fisheries. Most fisheries have been damaged by destructive fishing <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> methods. Selectivity characteristics of several <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> fishing methods were therefore examined for different commercially important fish species in major and minor lakes and recommendations made on suitable types of <b>gears,</b> <b>gear</b> sizes <b>and</b> fishing methods for exploitation of the fisheries resource...|$|R

50|$|Since {{the early}} 1950s, {{pleating}} machines {{have been available}} to home smockers. Using <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> specialty pleater needles, the fabric is forced through the <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> onto the threaded needles. Pleating machines are typically offered in 16-row, 24-row and 32-row widths. Manufacturers include Read and Amanda Jane.|$|R
5|$|Boeing {{announced}} the 747-500X and -600X at the 1996 Farnborough Airshow. The proposed models would have combined the 747's fuselage {{with a new}} 251ft (77m) span wing derived from the 777. Other changes included adding more powerful engines and {{increasing the number of}} tires from two to four on the nose landing <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> from 16 to 20 on the main landing gear.|$|E
5|$|Living River Siam has {{compiled}} {{the research and}} oral accounts of Thai villagers into many publications, which they make available on their website. Its published books document local knowledge about fish, the results of village research, a how-to manual for Thai Baan research, and citizens' guides to defending Thai rivers and communities. They also have produced posters of fish species and dams, pamphlets on fishing <b>gear,</b> <b>and</b> short documentaries about the river.|$|E
5|$|Not {{all of the}} ship's mishaps were storm-related. In late April 1911, Kroonland hit the {{breakwater}} in Dover Harbour, disabling {{the steering}} <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> delaying the ship by a day. On 8 January 1913, Kroonland ran aground in Ambrose Channel during a heavy fog while outbound from New York. It took more than six hours for tugs to free the liner from the soft mud.|$|E
40|$|A machine {{consists}} of a power source and a power transmission system, which provides controlled application of the power. Merriam-Webster defines transmission as an assembly of parts including the speed-changing <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> the propeller shaft by which the power is transmitted from an engine to a live axle.

5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing <b>gear,</b> <b>and</b> utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A ram air turbine provides power for basic controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.|$|E
5|$|The Airbus A318 {{is a small}} commercial, narrow-body (single-aisle) {{aircraft}} with a retractable tricycle landing <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> {{is powered}} by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. Two suppliers provide turbofan engines for the A318, CFM International with the CFM56-5B engine and Pratt & Whitney with the PW6000 engine. It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit having a single vertical stabilizer and rudder.|$|E

50|$|The Speedhub is more {{expensive}} than competing bicycle gear systems (both hub <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> derailleur <b>gears),</b> <b>and</b> it is about 500 to 1,000 grams heavier than a set of derailleur gears, but it offers the gear range of derailleur <b>gears</b> (<b>and</b> at its ratio of 5.26:1 more range than a typical road bike ratio of 4.28:1 with 50/34 chainrings and 11 to 32 tooth cassette) while requiring significantly less maintenance and having a longer service life. It is therefore mainly used in expensive touring bicycles and in mountain bikes, where its lack of (vulnerable) external components is useful.|$|R
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature last {{assessed}} the Borneo shark as Endangered, based on 2005 data {{that do not}} include the recent specimens from Mukah. Previously, several fishery surveys within its supposed historical range had failed to find it. The Borneo shark's conservation status remains precarious given its very small range in waters subjected to intensive artisanal and commercial fishing. It is caught by line <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> used for meat, though it has minimal commercial significance.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{ended up}} being used primarily to develop arresting <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> barriers, but were used operationally {{for a short time}} by at least one Texas-based United States Naval Reserve squadron as they transitioned to jets. Between them, the 30 production aircraft had only a total of 945 hours of flight time, only 31.5 hours each. Some aircraft flew only six hours which was enough for little more than their acceptance flight and the flight to their ultimate disposition.|$|E
5|$|The meat, oil, bones, and skins are {{valuable}} items sold in markets. Mortality is often caused by direct hunting by humans or other human-induced causes, such as habitat destruction, entanglement in fishing <b>gear,</b> <b>and</b> watercraft collisions.

It is commonly used on worm wheels before hobbing, but also used on internal <b>and</b> external spur <b>gears,</b> bevel <b>gears,</b> helical <b>gears,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gear</b> racks. The process is performed on gashers or universal milling machines, {{especially in the case}} of worm wheels. After gashing the gear or sprocket is finished via hobbing, shaping, or shaving.|$|R

5|$|While whaling {{no longer}} threatens the species, {{individuals}} {{are vulnerable to}} collisions with ships, entanglement in fishing <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> noise pollution. Like other cetaceans, humpbacks can be injured by excessive noise. In the 19th century, two humpback whales were found dead near sites of repeated oceanic sub-bottom blasting, with traumatic injuries and fractures in the ears.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E

5|$|Around AD1100, natives {{established}} adze quarries {{high up on}} Mauna Kea {{to extract}} the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions) to make tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing <b>gear,</b> <b>and</b> mƒÅmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; and workshops creating the finished product.|$|E

Float shifting is often done on large trucks with standard (non-synchronized) gearboxes.|$|R
