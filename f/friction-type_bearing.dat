40|$|DE 10313060 A UPAB: 20041117 NOVELTY - A {{roller bearing}} or <b>friction-type</b> <b>bearing</b> has a sensor for {{determining}} the loading on the bearing and a tribological layer between surfaces moving on/over one another. The tribological layer or coating is designed as a force- and/or temperature- sensitive measurement layer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for (a) a method {{for determining the}} loading on a roller- or friction-bearing and for (b) using a roller- or <b>friction-type</b> <b>bearing.</b> USE - As rolling contact bearing or <b>friction-type</b> <b>bearing</b> with measurement sensor for machine control and motor vehicle wheel bearings. ADVANTAGE - Bearing has good tribological properties with simplified and abrasion-resistant sensor system having direct measurement of the effective forces and temperature in rolling path...|$|E
40|$|The {{resonant}} behaviour of base-isolated high-rise buildings under long-period ground motions is investigated. The long-period ground motions {{are known}} to be induced by surface waves. While the acceleration amplitude of such long-period ground motion is small, the velocity amplitude is fairly large. It is expected that high-rise buildings and base-isolated buildings with long fundamental natural periods are greatly influenced by these long-period ground motions. Especially base-isolated high-rise buildings with <b>friction-type</b> <b>bearings</b> may have remarkable mechanical characteristics unfavourable for these long-period ground motions. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to reveal that the long-period ground motions recorded in Japan have the intensity to make base-isolated high-rise buildings in resonance with long-period components and that careful treatment is inevitable in the structural design of these base-isolated high-rise buildings. It is pointed out that the <b>friction-type</b> <b>bearings</b> are effective in general in avoiding the resonance with ground motions with a narrow-range frequency characteristic, but are dangerous for ground motions with a wide-range frequency characteristic in the long period range.
