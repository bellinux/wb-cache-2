5|$|Under {{the tutelage}} of John Toshack, Alonso's {{captaincy}} marked a resurgence of form for Real Sociedad. Toshack recognised Alonso's potential and invested much time in his young captain, creating a training method designed to improve <b>his</b> <b>touch</b> and control specifically for him. The team cemented its mid-table position in the 2001–02, finishing in 13th place. Alonso appeared consistently in La Liga with 30 appearances {{over the course of}} the season and also scored his first league goal, finishing with a season total of three. Real Sociedad's management changed again in the summer of 2002 with the arrival of Raynald Denoueix, but Alonso kept his place in the first team on the strength of his past performances.|$|E
5|$|With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of Rama bhakti movement in the 12th century, numerous works adopted the concept of Maya Sita. Devotees could not bear that Sita – the consort of Rama and the chief goddess of Rama-centric sects – was kidnapped by the demon Ravana and had to suffer his imprisonment and was defiled by <b>his</b> <b>touch.</b> The Maya Sita concept saves Sita from suffering Ravana's custody and succumbing to the temptation of acquiring the illusory deer. Instead, the texts create an illusory Sita, who does not recognize the illusory deer. The illusory deer motif in the Ramayana may have inspired the Maya Sita concept too. Maya Sita also excuses Sita from rebuking Lakshmana when she forces him to leave her and aid Rama in the illusory deer tale.|$|E
5|$|Although not gifted with pace, stamina, physicality or notable {{defensive}} skills, work-rate, or tackling abilities, Pirlo {{was known}} for his composure in possession, and drew praise for <b>his</b> <b>touch,</b> technique, balance, close control, and dribbling ability, as well as his flair and creativity in beating players with feints during one-on-one situations, in order to retain the ball and create space. As a playmaker, he is highly regarded by pundits for his outstanding vision, awareness, and football intelligence, as well as his movement, inventive play, anticipation, ability to read the game, and his wide range of distribution, which enabled him to play the ball first time and rarely relinquish possession, even when put under pressure; in addition to being capable of playing precise, short exchanges to teammates, he was also known for frequently attempting riskier and more difficult passes and is renowned in particular for his extremely accurate long-range passing, both on the ground or in the air, with either foot, despite being naturally right footed. He is considered {{to be one of the}} best passers in the history of the sport, and is also known for his accurate striking ability from distance. These characteristics allowed him to contribute to his team's offensive play with goals and assists.|$|E

50|$|Boujelbene was veritable dynamo in {{the middle}} of the field, impressing with <b>his</b> <b>touches,</b> <b>his</b> probing of {{opposing}} defences and his work rate. His performances in Africa's top club competition earned him a return to the Tunisian national side after a four-year absence, his contribution having been noticed by Tunisian coach Roger Lemerre.|$|R
5|$|On the July 3 SmackDown, Ziggler {{defeated}} Alex Riley {{to qualify}} for a spot in the World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank ladder match. On July 13, Ziggler, Zack Ryder and Justin Roberts were involved in a car accident in San Diego while driving from Comic-Con; none of them suffered severe injuries. Two days later at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, Ziggler won the Money in the Bank ladder match to guarantee him the opportunity to challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship at a time of his choosing within the next year. Later that night, Ziggler attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus after Alberto Del Rio attacked him after their match, but Del Rio stopped Ziggler from cashing in. On the following episode of SmackDown, Ziggler again attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus following a tag team match with Alberto Del Rio, but was laid out by Rey Mysterio and Sheamus before he could do so. During this time, Ziggler began a feud with Chris Jericho after claiming he had lost <b>his</b> <b>touch,</b> which resulted in Jericho attacking him on two occasions, and defeating him in a singles match at SummerSlam. The night after SummerSlam, Ziggler defeated Jericho in a rematch; as a result Ziggler retained his Money in the Bank contract and Jericho's WWE contract was terminated. Following this, Ziggler began feuding with Randy Orton on SmackDown four days later, after Orton hit him with an RKO when Ziggler tried to cash his Money in the Bank contract on a vulnerable Sheamus. The following week on SmackDown, Ziggler faced Orton in a match that was won by Orton, Ziggler defeated him in a rematch on Raw by pinning him while holding his tights. Ziggler faced Orton again at Night of Champions where he lost again, ending the feud. On November 18 at Survivor Series, Ziggler captained the traditional 5-on-5 elimination tag team match opposite Mick Foley and won the match by last pinning Orton, making him the sole survivor of the match.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} memorable moments of 2015 from Murphy was <b>his</b> <b>touch</b> to Ryan McHugh for Donegal's second goal in their Championship victory over Galway at Croke Park. It was {{considered}} {{one of the goals of}} the season.|$|E
25|$|However, {{his knee}} did {{eventually}} come good; and, whilst playing {{a couple of}} matches in the Second Eighteen, to get back <b>his</b> <b>touch</b> and his match fitness, he broke a bone in his hand. This meant {{that he was not}} fit to resume his place in the senior team until the last round match against Fitzroy. He was selected at full-forward, and he kicked 5 goals.|$|E

25|$|From {{an artistic}} standpoint, {{these stories are}} rather laboured productions, besides being ultra-romantic in tone; {{but it must be}} remembered that they were written mainly with an {{educational}} goal, and, moreover, they deserve high praise for their style. Herculano had greater book-learning than Scott, but lacked descriptive talent and skill in dialogue. <b>His</b> <b>touch</b> is heavy, and these novels show no dramatic power, which accounts for his failure as a playwright, but their influence was as great as their followers were many.|$|E
25|$|The domovoi {{is also an}} oracle, as his {{behavior}} foretells or forewarns about the future. If he laughs, sings, jokes, or dances good times can be expected, and if he strums a comb there is a wedding in the future, but if he wails at night, extinguishes a candle or makes himself visible it means a family member, usually {{the head of the}} household, will die. The touch of the domovoi is also a harbinger. If his furry hand feels warm, good fortune is indicated; however, if <b>his</b> <b>touch</b> is icy cold, misfortune is coming.|$|E
25|$|The play most {{directly}} {{analogous to the}} Miracle involved a player's, rather than a coach's, questionable decision that cost his team a game. On Thanksgiving Day 1993, the Cowboys were playing their customary holiday contest, this time against the visiting Dolphins, in sleet. As the clock ticked down, Dallas appeared to have won when it blocked a 41-yard Miami field goal. But as several Dolphins players were gathered around the ball, {{waiting for it to}} come to rest in order to down it {{as close as possible to}} the Dallas goal, Dallas defensive end Leon Lett sprinted downfield to try to recover it. He slipped on the slick surface and touched the ball. <b>His</b> <b>touch</b> meant that it became a live ball and Miami was able to recover at the Dallas 1 and kick a field goal for a 16–14 victory.|$|E

25|$|On May 24 at a WWE live {{event in}} Brazil, Jericho {{wrestled}} a match against CM Punk, during which Jericho crumpled up and kicked a Brazilian flag, causing local police {{to intervene and}} threaten Jericho with arrest. Jericho issued an apology to the audience, enabling the event to resume. The following day, WWE suspended Jericho for 30 days while apologizing {{to the people and}} government of Brazil. Jericho returned on the June 25 episode of Raw, and his absence was explained by a European tour with his band Fozzy which happened to coincide with his suspension. At Money in the Bank, Jericho participated in the WWE Championship Money in the Bank ladder match, but failed to win. The following night on Raw, Jericho confronted newly crowned Mr. Money in the Bank, Dolph Ziggler, who claimed that Jericho had lost <b>his</b> <b>touch.</b> Jericho attacked Ziggler with a Codebreaker, thus turning into a fan favorite in the process {{for the first time since}} 2008. At SummerSlam, Jericho defeated Ziggler. The following night on Raw, Ziggler defeated Jericho in a rematch and, as a result, Ziggler retained his Money in the Bank contract and Jericho's WWE contract was terminated as per a pre match stipulation put in place by Raw General Manager, AJ Lee. This was used to write him off so he could tour with Fozzy for the remainder of the year.|$|E
500|$|The {{short film}} for [...] "Billie Jean" [...] is {{considered}} the video that brought MTV, until then a fairly new and unknown music channel, into mainstream attention. It {{was one of the}} first videos by a black artist to be aired regularly by the channel, as the network's executives felt black music wasn't [...] "rock" [...] enough. Directed by Steve Barron, the video shows a photographer who follows Jackson. The paparazzo never catches the singer, and when photographed Jackson fails to materialize on the developed picture. The entertainer dances his way to Billie Jean's hotel room and as he walks along a sidewalk, each tile lights up at <b>his</b> <b>touch.</b>|$|E
500|$|In late 1964, Aubrey {{approached}} Stanton with a proposal. Claiming he had investors lined-up {{and ready}} to buy the company, Aubrey said once in control, they would fire Paley, install Stanton as chairman, and promote Aubrey to Stanton's post, CBS corporate president. This {{did not come to}} pass, but Aubrey's contempt for Paley knew no bounds, Aubrey even showing his disregard for Paley in public. The Internal Revenue Service filing a tax lien against Aubrey for $38,047.93 was another irritant for Paley. Aubrey also seemed to have lost <b>his</b> <b>touch,</b> the early ratings for the 1964–65 season showing the new shows that fall were flops. Aubrey panicked, noted Life, and [...] "by that time Paley had made his decision to fire Aubrey, though he had yet found no plausible excuse." ...|$|E

[...] Bush went on to praise McElwain, saying [...] "Our country was captivated by an amazing story on the {{basketball}} court. It's {{the story of a young}} man who found <b>his</b> <b>touch</b> on the basketball court, which, in turn, touched the hearts of citizens all around the country." [...] Bush also stated that upon seeing McElwain on television, he [...] "wept, just like a lot of other people did".|$|E
500|$|Hay was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of Ohio's William McKinley and worked closely with McKinley's political manager, Cleveland industrialist Mark Hanna. In 1889, Hay supported McKinley in his unsuccessful effort to become Speaker of the House. Four years later, McKinley—by then Governor of Ohio—faced a crisis when a friend whose notes he had imprudently co-signed went bankrupt during the Panic of 1893. [...] The debts were beyond the governor's means to pay, {{and the possibility of}} insolvency threatened McKinley's promising political career. [...] Hay was among those Hanna called upon to contribute, buying up $3,000 of the debt of over $100,000. Although others paid more, [...] "Hay's checks were two of the first, and <b>his</b> <b>touch</b> was more personal, a kindness McKinley never forgot". [...] The governor wrote, [...] "How can I ever repay you & other dear friends?" ...|$|E
500|$|Booth {{failed to}} pass 20 {{in the first six}} innings of the Test series. With Australia 10 up after three Tests, a draw in the Fourth Test was {{sufficient}} to retain the urn. Booth regained <b>his</b> <b>touch</b> with three scores beyond fifty in four innings leading up to the Fourth Test, including 132 against Middlesex. When the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Fourth Test, Booth made a [...] "courtly" [...] 98 in a 219-run partnership with Simpson. The Australians batted for more than two days to burn off any chance of an England victory. Booth then scored 193 not out, his highest for the summer, in Australia's 7/315 declared against Yorkshire, setting up the tourists' victory. He made 74 in the Fifth Test and ended the series with 210 runs at 42.00. Along with Simpson and Lawry, Booth was one of three Australians to accumulate more than 1,500 first-class runs for the English summer.|$|E

[...] Kinney Littlefield of The Orange County Register said it was [...] "perhaps the best Homicide episode ever" [...] and praised D'Onofrio's performance. USA Today gave the episode its highest rating of four stars. Tom Shales of The Washington Post called it, [...] "a tour de force for D'Onofrio and Braugher". Entertainment Weekly writer Bruce Fretts said, [...] "This is as gripping an hour of television as you're ever likely to see." [...] Television and literary critic John Leonard said that [...] "Subway" [...] was [...] "an artistic experience that is as genuine and accomplished and crafted as you will get anywhere". David P.

500|$|Stratton tried {{variations}} of the experiment {{over the next few}} years. First he wore the glasses for eight days, back at Berkeley. The first day he was nauseated and the inverted landscape felt unreal, but by the second day just his own body position seemed strange, and by day seven, things felt normal. A sense of strangeness returned when the glasses were taken out, though the world looked straight side up; he found himself reaching out with the right hand when he should have used the left, and the other way around. Then he tried the experiment outdoors. [...] He also tried another experiment disrupting the mental link between touch and sight. There he wore a set of mirrors attached to a harness as shown in the figure allowing, and forcing, him to see his body from above. He found the senses adapted in a similar way over three days. His interpretation was that we build up an association between sight and touch by associational learning over a period of time. During certain periods, the disconnect between vision and touch made him feel as if his body was not where <b>his</b> <b>touch</b> and proprioceptive feeling told him it was. This out-of-body experience, caused by an altered but normal sensory perception, vanished when he attended to the issue critically, focusing on the disconnect.|$|E
500|$|Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier {{believed}} that Land of Black Gold suffered from having been [...] "rebaked", being [...] "pulled between the 'old' pre-war Tintin {{and the more}} modern one." [...] The Lofficiers opined that the story's [...] "clear concern about war and rumours of war" [...] enable it to fit well after King Ottokar's Sceptre, at {{the point at which}} Hergé had initially developed it. They felt that this pre-Second World War atmosphere also pervaded the second, coloured version of the book, but that they had nevertheless been partly removed by the creation of the third version. Despite this, they felt that the third version of the story was [...] "better" [...] because it incorporated elements from the spy thrillers that had become increasingly popular in Western Europe during the 1950s. Despite its problems, they thought that the Thom(p)sons ingestion of Formula 14 was [...] "virtually inspired", showing that Hergé [...] "had lost none of <b>his</b> <b>touch</b> when it comes to creating unforgettable images". They opined that the character of Abdullah [...] "indisputably steals the show" [...] in Land of Black Gold, commenting on his [...] "love-hate" [...] relationship with Haddock and suggesting that he is [...] "possibly the only character to have ever succeeded in driving Tintin so batty that he loses his cool." [...] They ultimately awarded the story two stars out of five, feeling that Hergé had been unable to develop its [...] "greater potential".|$|E
60|$|Murmurs {{of admiration}} at the {{exceeding}} {{beauty of this}} performance went about among the crowd.
