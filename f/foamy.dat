5|$|The mature {{mycelium}} {{consists of}} thin-walled, densely packed hyphae that are 1.5–3.2µm in diameter. They are often gnarled or somewhat spiral (subhelicoid), and frequently branched {{at an angle}} of about 45°, with a clamp {{at the base of}} the branch. They contain amorphous granules that appear refractive when viewed under phase contrast microscopy, and their walls are often encrusted with tiny granules. Gloeocystidia (thin-walled cystidia with refractive, frequently granular contents) are common; they measure 50–85 by 6.5–8.5µm, and are club-shaped (sometimes elongated), thin-walled, and often have one or two lobes with rounded tips. Containing <b>foamy</b> and pale yellow contents, they are a refractive yellow color under phase contrast. Initially they are erect but they soon fall under their own weight to lie on the agar surface. Crystalline deposits are abundant as small, randomly scattered plate-like or star-like crystals.|$|E

25|$|A {{parasite}} sometimes undergoes co-speciation {{with its}} host. An example {{is between the}} simian <b>foamy</b> virus (SFV) and its primate hosts. The phylogenies of SFV polymerase and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II from African and Asian primates {{were found to be}} closely congruent in branching order and divergence times, implying that the simian <b>foamy</b> viruses co-speciated with Old World primates for at least 30 million years.|$|E
25|$|Domestic cats also {{transmit}} diseases to the wildcat, including feline calicivirus, feline coronavirus, feline <b>foamy</b> virus, and {{the fatal}} feline leukemia virus. In the wild, efforts to conserve wildcats include neutering feral cats and euthanizing diseased feral cats to prevent hybridization and spread of disease. Other continued {{threats to the}} wildcat include habitat loss and hunting.|$|E
25|$|Nonoxynol-9 is {{sometimes}} included in shaving creams for its properties as a nonionic surfactant; it helps break down skin oils that normally protect hair from moisture, {{so that they}} become wet and, hence, softer and easier to shave. Gillette formerly used nonoxynol-9 for this purpose in its <b>Foamy</b> products, but has discontinued the practice.|$|E
25|$|An {{aquarium}} must {{be maintained}} regularly {{to ensure that the}} fish are kept healthy. Daily maintenance consists of checking the fish for signs of stress and disease. Also, aquarists must make sure that the water has a good quality and it is not cloudy or <b>foamy</b> and the temperature of the water is appropriate for the particular species of fish that live in the aquarium.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} in water content {{can be used}} to distinguish tektites from terrestrial volcanic glasses. When heated to their melting point, terrestrial volcanic glasses will turn into a <b>foamy</b> glass because of their content of water and other volatiles. Unlike terrestrial volcanic glass, a tektite will produce only a few bubbles at most when heated to its melting point, because of its much lower water and other volatiles content.|$|E
25|$|Before Europeans came, Alberni and the West Coast of Vancouver Island was the {{traditional}} {{territory of the}} Tseshaht and Hupacasath First Nations of the Nuu-Chah-Nulth Tribal Council. The Nuu-chah-nulth were previously called the Nootka. Many place names in Port Alberni have a Nuu-chah-nulth origin, such as Somass (washing), Kitsuksis (log across mouth of creek), Pacheena (<b>foamy),</b> and Nootka (go around). Ancient petroglyph carvings {{can be found at}} Sproat Lake.|$|E
25|$|The full {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} beetle's unique defense mechanism is unknown, but biologists {{have shown that the}} system could have theoretically evolved from defenses found in other beetles in incremental steps by natural selection. Specifically, quinone chemicals are a precursor to sclerotin, a brownish substance produced by beetles and other insects to harden their exoskeleton. Some beetles additionally store excess foul-smelling quinones, including hydroquinone, in small sacs below their skin as a natural deterrent against predators—all carabid beetles have this sort of arrangement. Some beetles additionally mix hydrogen peroxide, a common by-product of the metabolism of cells, in with the hydroquinone; some of the catalases that exist in most cells make the process more efficient. The chemical reaction produces heat and pressure, and some beetles exploit the latter to push out the chemicals onto the skin; this is the case in the beetle Metrius contractus, which produces a <b>foamy</b> discharge when attacked. In the bombardier beetle, the muscles that prevent leakage from the reservoir additionally developed a valve permitting more controlled discharge of the poison and an elongated abdomen to permit better control over the direction of discharge.|$|E
25|$|The {{breeding}} {{period in}} most areas lasts from November to January, though most mating only lasts {{a month and a}} half. Prior to mating, the males develop their subcutaneous armour, in preparation for confronting rivals. The testicles double in size and the glands secrete a <b>foamy</b> yellowish liquid. Once ready to reproduce, males travel long distances in search of a sounder of sows, eating little on the way. Once a sounder has been located, the male drives off all young animals and persistently chases the sows. At this point, the male fiercely fights potential rivals, A single male can mate with 5–10 sows. By the end of the rut, males are often badly mauled and have lost 20% of their body weight, with bite-induced injuries to the penis being common. The gestation period varies according to the age of the expecting mother. For first time breeders, it lasts 114–130 days, while it lasts 133–140 days in older sows. Farrowing occurs between March and May, with litter sizes depending on the age and nutrition of the mother. The average litter consists of 4–6 piglets, with the maximum being 10–12. The piglets are whelped in a nest constructed from twigs, grasses and leaves. Should the mother die prematurely, the piglets are adopted by the other sows in the sounder.|$|E
500|$|Hops contain several {{characteristics}} that brewers desire in beer. Hops contribute a bitterness that balances {{the sweetness of}} the malt; the bitterness of beers is measured on the International Bitterness Units scale. Hops contribute floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours to beer. Hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewer's yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in [...] "head retention", the length of time that a <b>foamy</b> head created by carbonation will last. The acidity of hops is a preservative.|$|E
500|$|The nitrogenated and {{pasteurised}} {{variant of}} the beer available in kegs and cans. It is brewed in Samlesbury. The canned variant, launched in 1991, contains a widget to give the beer a creamy white head. The beer's ABV was reduced from 3.8% to 3.5% in late 2008. On draught in the United Kingdom it is typically served at 5 to 7 degrees Celsius, although an Extra Cold variant served at 3 to 5 degrees Celsius has been available since 2006. Its taste, or perceived lack of it, has been criticised by some, with Andrew Jefford describing it as a [...] "blandly <b>foamy</b> nitrokeg travesty of the original [...] ".|$|E
500|$|August Brown for the Los Angeles Times {{said that}} [...] "'Cheers (Drink to That)' and 'Raining Men,' as <b>foamy</b> and spunky {{as they may}} be, are such a dogleg turn from Rated R that they come off {{as little more than}} image recalibration. That's her {{prerogative}} as an artist, and it's certainly earned. But it underscores the one thing we've always wondered about Rihanna — what is she really feeling?". Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media was more critical of the song, commenting that [...] "Raining Men is a shameless Beyoncé rip-off that would be quickly dismissed if not for the fact that it's a pretty-damn-good Beyoncé rip off with a characteristically scene-stealing guest verse from Nicki Minaj". James Reed of The Boston Globe also noticed the similarity between the song's composition and the work of American R recording artist Beyoncé Knowles, saying [...] "'Raining Men', borrowing a digitized riff from Beyoncé's 'Diva', features rising rapper Nicki Minaj on a typically manic guest rhyme. The song's message doubles as the album's mantra: Some cats really do have nine lives". Idolator reviewer Becky Bain praised Minaj's [...] "infectious and energetic verse" [...] and felt the song's rhythm [...] "fits Nicki's quirkiness perfectly".|$|E
500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of DPB requires {{analysis of the}} lungs and bronchiolar tissues, which can require a lung biopsy, or the more preferred high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs. The diagnostic criteria include severe inflammation in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles and lung tissue lesions that appear as nodules within the terminal and respiratory bronchioles in both lungs. The nodules in DPB appear as opaque lumps when viewed on X-rays of the lung, and can cause airway obstruction, which is evaluated by a pulmonary function test, or PFT. [...] Lung X-rays can also reveal dilation of the bronchiolar passages, another sign of DBP. HRCT scans often show blockages of some bronchiolar passages with mucus, which {{is referred to as}} the [...] "tree-in-bud" [...] pattern. [...] Hypoxemia, another sign of breathing difficulty, is revealed by measuring the oxygen and carbon dioxide content of the blood, using a blood test called arterial blood gas. Other findings observed with DPB include the proliferation of lymphocytes (white blood cells that fight infection), neutrophils, and <b>foamy</b> histiocytes (tissue macrophages) in the lung lining. Bacteria such as H.influenzae and P.aeruginosa are also detectable, with the latter becoming more prominent as the disease progresses. The white blood, bacterial and other cellular content of the blood can be measured by taking a complete blood count (CBC). Elevated levels of IgG and IgA (classes of immunoglobulins) may be seen, as well as the presence of rheumatoid factor (an indicator of autoimmunity). Hemagglutination, a clumping of red blood cells in response to the presence of antibodies in the blood, may also occur. Neutrophils, beta-defensins, leukotrienes, and chemokines can also be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid injected then removed from the bronchiolar airways of individuals with DPB, for evaluation.|$|E
2500|$|Soviet {{scientists}} and winemakers continued works after the Second world war to optimize technology of [...] "Soviet champagne" [...] production.

2500|$|The latte macchiato is milk steamed to microfoam, {{served in}} a glass with a half shot of espresso poured gently through the <b>foamy</b> top layer, {{creating}} a layered drink with a [...] "macchia"—a spot—of espresso on the top. As with a caffè macchiato, which is espresso with a spot of milk atop, indicating there's a hint of milk underneath the espresso foam, a latte macchiato is the opposite, to indicate there is espresso in the milk.|$|E
2500|$|During these name changes, {{the brewery}} found {{the product that}} would become their {{signature}} brew. [...] Pearl beer was formulated and first brewed in Bremen, Germany, by the Kaiser–Beck Brewery, which produces Beck's beer. [...] Pearl beer's name came from Kaiser–Beck's brewmaster, who thought the <b>foamy</b> bubbles in a freshly poured glass of the brew resembled sparkling pearls. [...] In Germany, the brew was called [...] "Perle". [...] When brought to the United States, the spelling was changed to English: Pearl. [...] In 1886, the first bottles and wooden kegs of American Pearl beer rolled off the line and into local tap rooms.|$|E
2500|$|Pumice {{is created}} when super-heated, highly {{pressurized}} rock is violently ejected from a volcano. The unusual <b>foamy</b> configuration of pumice happens because of simultaneous rapid cooling and rapid depressurization. The depressurization creates bubbles {{by lowering the}} solubility of gases (including water and CO2) that are dissolved in the lava, causing the gases to rapidly exsolve (like the bubbles of CO2 that appear when a carbonated drink is opened). The simultaneous cooling and depressurization freezes the bubbles in a matrix. [...] Eruptions under water are rapidly cooled and the large volume of pumice created can be a shipping hazard for cargo ships.|$|E

2500|$|Buckwheat pancakes, {{sometimes}} {{raised with}} yeast, are eaten in several countries. They {{are known as}} buckwheat blinis in Russia, galettes in France (savoury [...] crêpes made with buckwheat flour, water, and eggs are associated with Lower Brittany, whilst savoury galettes made without eggs are from Higher Brittany), ployes in Acadia, and boûketes (which are named after the buckwheat plant) in the Wallonia region of Belgium. Similar pancakes were a common food in American pioneer days. They are light and <b>foamy.</b> The buckwheat flour gives them an earthy, mildly mushroom-like taste. In Ukraine, yeast rolls called hrechanyky are made from buckwheat. Buckwheat flour {{is also used to}} make Nepali dishes such as dhedo and kachhyamba.|$|E
2500|$|After Soilent Grün {{broke up}} in 1982, Bela and Farin decided to form another band. In {{the first two}} years (including Sahnie) they mostly played in clubs in their hometown, Berlin. Their first release was a {{contribution}} to the sampler 20 schäumende Stimmungshits (rough translation: [...] "20 <b>foamy</b> party hits"), featuring a strong alcohol theme (for example, the chorus of [...] "Vollmilch" [...] translates as [...] "you drink whiskey, he drinks beer, I drink milk"). In 1983 they won a rock contest in Berlin and with the prize money they recorded their debut EP Uns geht's prima... ("We're doing great..."). Finally CBS signed them, and they released their first LP Debil ("Moronic") in 1984 then their second Im Schatten der Ärzte ("In the shadow of Die Ärzte") a year later.|$|E
2500|$|The {{incubation}} period for {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} has a range between one and 12 days. The disease is characterized by high fever that declines rapidly {{after two or three}} days, blisters inside the mouth that lead to excessive secretion of stringy or <b>foamy</b> saliva and to drooling, and blisters on the feet that may rupture and cause lameness. [...] Adult animals may suffer weight loss from which they do not recover for several months, as well as swelling in the testicles of mature males, and in cows, milk production can decline significantly. [...] Though most animals eventually recover from FMD, the disease can lead to myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and death, especially in newborn animals. [...] Some infected ruminants remain asymptomatic carriers, but they nonetheless carry FMDV and may be able to transmit it to others. Pigs cannot serve as asymptomatic carriers.|$|E
2500|$|Nitrogen is used under high {{pressure}} when dispensing dry stouts (such as Guinness) and other creamy beers because it displaces CO2 to (artificially) form a rich tight {{head and a}} less carbonated taste. This makes the beer feel smooth on the palate and gives a <b>foamy</b> appearance. [...] Premixed bottled gas for creamy beers is usually 75% nitrogen and 25% CO2. [...] This premixed gas which only works well with creamy beers {{is often referred to}} as Guinness Gas, Beer Gas, or Aligal. [...] Using [...] "Beer Gas" [...] with other beer styles can cause the last 5% to 10% of the beer in each keg to taste very flat and lifeless. [...] In the UK, the term keg beer would imply the beer is pasteurised, in contrast to unpasteurised cask ale. Some of the newer microbreweries may offer a nitro keg stout which is filtered but not pasteurized.|$|E
2500|$|A boulder or ledge in {{the middle}} of a river or near the side can obstruct the flow of the river, and can also create a [...] "pillow"; when water flows {{backwards}} upstream of the obstruction, or a [...] "pour over" [...] (over the boulder); and [...] "hydraulics" [...] or [...] "holes" [...] where the river flows back on itself—perhaps back under the drop—often with fearful results for those caught in its grasp. (Holes, or hydraulics, are so-called because their <b>foamy,</b> aerated water provides less buoyancy and can feel like an actual hole in the river surface.) If the flow passes next to the obstruction, an eddy may form behind the obstruction; although eddies are typically sheltered areas where boaters can stop to rest, scout or leave the main current, they may be swirling and whirlpool-like. As with hydraulics (which pull downward rather than to the side and are essentially eddies turned at a 90-degree angle), the power of eddies increases with the flow rate.|$|E

2500|$|A full {{redesign}} of all athletics logos and marks was commissioned in 1998, replacing the [...] "angry wave" [...] and [...] "wavy T" [...] designs {{with a green}} and blue oblique T crested by a <b>foamy</b> wave. Gumby was replaced with a new pelican mascot, recalling the university seal, {{and the fact that}} a pelican was often used {{in the first half of}} the century as the emblem of Tulane's athletics teams. The pelican is also the Louisiana state bird and is found on the state flag and state seal. The name [...] "Riptide" [...] was selected for the performing pelican by the administration after a vote of the student body in which the students actually voted that the pelican be named [...] "Pecker." [...] The pelican mascot name may have been so voted as the student body had also overwhelmingly voted for Poseidon to be the mascot. Poseidon was rejected by the administration and student body government because it could be portrayed as a white male. In 2014, Tulane changed the color of the [...] "wave" [...] above the [...] "T" [...] from a seafoam green to a color closer to lime green.|$|E
2500|$|Females begin ovipositing the {{day after}} {{copulation}} and do so in one batch during a single oviposition event. Shorter and longer oviposition durations are associated with smaller and larger egg masses, which {{are directly related to}} female size. Just before beginning to oviposit, females exhibit dispersal behavior. They position themselves on a branch, spread their wings, and extend their abdominal tip around the branch to prepare for oviposition. As they oviposit, they move around the branch aligning the eggs, forming a ring-like structure around the branch. [...] They then cover their eggs with a <b>foamy</b> substance known as spumaline. It has been hypothesized that the spumaline cover protects eggs from predation and parasitism. [...] Offspring pass the winter inside their eggs. Although cold tolerant, they are susceptible to freezing in extreme cold temperatures, with the risk of mortality varying seasonally with changes in temperature and physiology. Not much is known about parental effects on offspring survival during the winter. The only source of energy for overwintering forest tent caterpillar eggs comes from the parental generation. As a result, overwintering performance of the insect should be viewed in the context of parental fitness.|$|E

2500|$|Pulque is a milky, <b>foamy,</b> {{alcoholic}} beverage native to central Mexico and made from fermented maguey sap, similar to tequila and mescal {{but with a}} much lower alcohol content, between 3 and 4%. The maguey plant flourishes in hot climates with little to no water, as the plant stores water very well, much like a cactus. The maguey grows slowly and the sap must be removed shortly before the plant flowers. Once the tapping begins, the plant produces [...] "about a half gallon [...] a day for three months." [...] With a tool {{that looks like a}} spoon and is called a tlaquiche, a worker known as a tlachiquero [...] "scrapes off the center of the plant to extract the liquid previously mentioned. He then collects it in a hollow bowl called an acocote, to then be placed in a container called an odre." [...] The containers used for the fermentation process are usually made from animal skins, often cow leather. Leather is popular because of its ability to thermoregulate; leather also provides the sap with necessary beneficial bacteria cultures that improve taste and consistency. Pulque naturally ferments in less than twenty-four hours. Because it will spoil quickly after this period, every step in the process must be taken in close sequence and physical proximity. The maguey plants, the production and distribution facilities, and the places to which the pulque is distributed must all be relatively close together geographically. The taste has been described as slightly sour. Pure pulque is often mixed with fruit juices and other foods to create different flavors.|$|E
