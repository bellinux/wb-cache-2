50|$|From its {{inception}} in 2000, Geneva Call has engaged with about 100 armed non-State actors worldwide and sensitized thousands of their leaders and members on international humanitarian norms. As of today, 49 armed non-State actors have signed the <b>Deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commitment</b> banning anti-personnel mines, 19 have signed the <b>Deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commitment</b> protecting children in armed conflict, and 16 have signed the <b>Deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commitment</b> prohibiting sexual violence and gender discrimination.|$|E
50|$|In June 2012, Geneva Call {{launched}} a third <b>Deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commitment,</b> the <b>Deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commitment</b> under Geneva Call for the Prohibition of Sexual Violence in Situations of Armed Conflict and towards the Elimination of Gender Discrimination.|$|E

50|$|Overall, their {{compliance}} {{record has}} been good. Except in one case, no conclusive evidence of violation <b>of</b> the <b>Deeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commitment</b> {{has been found}} to date. Signatories have taken implementing measures and cooperated in the monitoring of their compliance by Geneva Call. In addition, a number of armed non-State actors that have not signed the <b>Deeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commitment</b> have nevertheless taken steps towards compliance with international standards, for example by limiting mine use and/or facilitating mine action in areas under their control.|$|R

30|$|Given {{the above}} {{shortcomings}} of previous initiatives, it is submitted {{that a new}} approach {{must be taken to}} increase the potential of human rights observance by NSAGs during humanitarian crises. To avoid some of the challenges faced by measures such as the <b>deeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> and more general human rights agreements (e.g. engagement with NSAGs and state recognition of agreements), this approach should use an existing measure that is already accepted by states and NSAGs, in a new way. The measure proposed is the use of ceasefire agreements between parties to a NIAC.|$|R

40|$|Whether {{international}} humanitarian {{norms are}} respected {{during and after}} civil conflict depends {{on the behavior of}} both governments and non-state actors (NSAs). However, international conventions on the protection of civilians generally do not address NSAs, as such conventions are open only to the representatives of states. In a pioneering initiative, the non-governmental organization Geneva Call has started to address this problem by soliciting NSAs to sign ?<b>deeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment?</b> to ban particular activities violating humanitarian norms. Focusing on the case of anti-personnel mines, we examine why non-state actors would choose to sign conventions that limit their autonomy, and whether such conventions can change the behavior of governments and non-state armed groups. We propose a game-theoretic model of how the interaction between governments and NSAs shape their incentives to commit to and comply with international humanitarian norms. Our empirical evidence highlights the importance of these interdepencies between governments and NSAs in the realm of humanitarian engagements...|$|R
30|$|Similar {{comments}} {{can be made}} {{in relation}} to Geneva Call’s <b>Deeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commitment.</b> There are three types <b>of</b> <b>commitment,</b> dealing with anti-personnel mines, the protection of children from the effects of armed conflict and the prohibition of sexual violence and gender discrimination (see Geneva Call 2014 a, 2014 b). The deed relating to the protection of children has been a landmark development within the global campaign against child soldiers. The deed is the first international instrument that NSAGs could voluntarily and unilaterally sign and be judged upon their implementation thereof. Nevertheless, they may only have real value as a positive gesture. The deeds have been instrumental in raising awareness and encouraging NSAGs to consider the human rights impacts of their actions more concretely. In particular, the deed for the prohibition of sexual violence and gender discrimination provides a substantial list <b>of</b> <b>commitments</b> to which the groups agree to adhere to. These include certain provisions that would also fall under international human rights law, such as a prohibition of discrimination against women and equal access to healthcare (Geneva Call 2013 a, para 5). Additionally, the deed does acknowledge that it is “one step or part of a broader commitment” to human rights and humanitarian law (Geneva Call 2013 a, para 9). Nonetheless, there is no direct reference to human rights obligations of NSAGs.|$|R

30|$|The above discussions {{aimed to}} outline a {{prevalent}} and persistent challenge faced during non-international armed conflicts. The humanitarian crises being suffered {{by so many}} may be mitigated to some extent through the imposition of (temporary) human rights obligations on NSAGs. As well as remedying to a degree the inequality of obligations and human rights protection, human rights norms {{could be used to}} compliment and build upon humanitarian obligations of all parties to non-international armed conflicts. Current initiatives that have been taken to try to alleviate the human cost of armed conflicts, including action plans, the ‘list <b>of</b> shame’ and <b>deeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment,</b> have had some success in governing the behaviour of NSAGs. Nonetheless, large lacunas exist. This is particularly with regard to the ability of the initiatives to tackle human rights protection. For this reason, a possible additional and complementary measure that could be taken is to include some subsistence rights obligations in short-term ceasefire agreements. This envisages giving human rights a larger role in the governance of NSAGs. Whilst not constituting a perfect solution, the agreements could prove to be a way of ameliorating situations of humanitarian crisis without requiring an unreasonable burden on the international community.|$|R
