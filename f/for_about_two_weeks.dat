5|$|On {{the night}} before his 22nd birthday, on 15 February 1944, Schnaufer and his crew claimed aerial {{victories}} 45 to 47. Bomber Command had sent 561 Lancasters and 314 Halifax four-engined bombers, supported by de Havilland Mosquito night-fighters and bombers, destined for Berlin. Schnaufer, who had been suffering from stomach pains all day, and his crew returned to Leeuwarden at 00:14. Rumpelhardt {{had been the first}} to congratulate him on his birthday over the intercom. Their fellow airmen had prepared a birthday celebration. The stomach pains had become unbearable and Schnaufer was taken to a hospital with appendicitis. He stayed in the hospital <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> before, together with Rumpelhardt, he went on vacation back home. Carelessly lifting his suitcase, he burst his stitches, resulting in further hospitalisation. He flew his first mission after these events on 19 March 1944.|$|E
5|$|That morning, {{the police}} interrogated Fischer's girlfriend Marianela at the sheriff's office. They {{asked her if}} she had ever had cross words with Cristina. She said she had never talked to her, though she was {{confused}} why they asked about his ex-girlfriend. Cisneros was also interrogated, but the police found nothing unusual about her behavior, only that she was nervous, and had left her car keys inside her vehicle. Later that day, Cristina went to Buddy's house and offered her condolences. The police did not treat the Cisneros' connection to Fischer any differently {{than the rest of the}} leads. They knew of Cisneros's calls, but they did not think it was suspicious enough to rule the murder a crime of passion. His stepfather initially thought that the murder was tied to a legal dispute over a contract worth thousands of dollars he had with a Chinese shrimp firm based in Arroyo City, Texas, just north of Brownsville that he had terminated. The police began to investigate this lead, and told Fischer's family that they were probably in danger. <b>For</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> they rarely left their house, and his parents considered sending Kathy and Eric to San Antonio, Texas, where their grandparents lived.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 25 April 1806, Rana Bahadur held a meeting at Tribhuvan Khawas's house with rest of the courtiers, during which he taunted and {{threatened}} to execute Sher Bahadur. At around 10pm, Sher Bahadur in desperation drew a sword and killed Rana Bahadur Shah before being cut down by nearby courtiers, Bam Shah and Bal Narsingh Kunwar, also allies of Bhimsen. The assassination of Rana Bahadur Shah triggered a great massacre in Bhandarkhal (a royal garden east of Kathmandu Durbar) and {{at the bank of}} Bishnumati river. That very night members of Sher Bahadur's faction – Bidur Shah, Tribhuvan Khawas, and Narsingh Gurung – and even King Prithvipal Sen of Palpa, who was under house arrest in Patan Durbar, were swiftly rounded up and killed in Bhandarkhal. Their dead bodies were not allowed funeral rites and were dragged and thrown by the banks of Bishnumati to be eaten by vultures and jackals. The next few days, all the sons of Sher Bahadur Shah, Bidur Shah, Tribhuvan Khawas and Narsingh Gurung, aged 2 to 15 were beheaded by the bank of Bishnumati; their wives and daughters were given to the untouchables, their body guards and servants were also put to death, and all their property seized. Bhimsen managed to kill everyone who did not agree with him or anyone who could potentially become a problem for him in the future. In this massacre that lasted <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> a total of ninety-three people (16 women and 77 men) lost their lives.|$|E

50|$|The female lays two {{or three}} pale greenish-blue eggs with reddish-brown blotches. The eggs measure {{approximately}} 19 - 21 mm by 15 - 16 mm and weigh 2.6 - 2.8 g each. They are incubated by the female for 12-14 days, during which she spends {{about two-thirds of the}} daytime brooding or attend the nest in some other way. The male helps in feeding the chicks however, which stay in the nest <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> more <b>weeks.</b> They are not very voracious, and even as they approach fledging the parents will only feed them every 10 minutes or so. Brood parasitism, e.g. by the shiny cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis), may occur, and breeding failure due to predation is very frequent during the incubation period. Predation on nestlings, on the other hand, does not seem to occur more often than in similar-sized Passeroidea.|$|R

25|$|In 1345, Ibn Battuta {{travelled}} on to Samudra Pasai Sultanate {{in present-day}} Aceh, Northern Sumatra, where he {{notes in his}} travel log that the ruler of Samudra Pasai was a pious Muslim named Sultan Al-Malik Al-Zahir Jamal-ad-Din, who performed his religious duties with utmost zeal and often waged campaigns against animists in the region. The island of Sumatra, according to Ibn Battuta, was rich in camphor, areca nut, cloves, and tin.

5000|$|Beginning {{as early}} as August, nests are built in dense foliage, usually in a {{terminal}} fork of a Pisonia branch, though several other plants may be used. The cup-shaped nest is constructed by both members of the pair from dry grasses and other vegetable material, as well as cobwebs and various kinds of anthropogenic debris such as toilet paper, fishing line and human hair. Nests may take {{up to a week}} or more to complete. [...] The usual clutch is of three pale blue eggs, with an incubation period of 12-14 days. The hatchlings are altricial and nidicolous and are fed by both parents. The chicks fledge at 12-14 days old and leave the nest shortly afterwards, still being fed by their parents <b>for</b> <b>about</b> another <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b> [...] In a study of the 1969/70 breeding season, the mean number of fledglings produced per nest was 1.9. [...] Second and third clutches extend breeding through much of the wet season into January.|$|R
25|$|Incubation lasts between 22 and 26 days, {{and begins}} after laying the first egg, {{although}} it is discontinuous until the second egg is laid. This means the first two chicks are born close together, and the third chick some time later. Young chicks are brooded by their parents <b>for</b> <b>about</b> one or <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> and often {{at least one parent}} remains with them, until they fledge, to guard them.
