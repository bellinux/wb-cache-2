5|$|Wind gusts {{in central}} Maryland peaked at 83mph (134km/h) in Silver Spring, with a {{location}} along the Patuxent River recording sustained winds of 55mph (88km/h). Unofficially, rainfall reached 7inches (178mm) in portions of Maryland, though the highest precipitation amount totaled 3.21inches (82mm) at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Swells from the hurricane produced high storm surges along the Western Shore which peaked at 8.2feet (2.5m) in Baltimore. Annapolis also reported {{a surge of}} 7.2feet (2.2m). In many locations, the storm surge was higher than the previous record set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane. Throughout central Maryland, 472buildings and homes were destroyed, with 3,260 greatly damaged and another 3,600 affected in general. Strong storm surge from the hurricane washed 43,000tons (39,000 t) of salt, millions of pounds of nitrogen and phosphorus, and {{millions of gallons of}} raw sewage into the Chesapeake Bay. One person {{died as a result of}} a traffic death in the state. Property damage totaled $530.5million (2003USD, ($ USD), with an additional $190,000 (2003USD, ($ USD) in crop damage. The crop damage was primarily limited to minor damage to livestock buildings and sheds, though the winds destroyed a hay barn and a dairy barn at one farm in Frederick County. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated the winds of the hurricane destroyed 15–30% of the <b>field</b> <b>corn</b> and 10–15% of the soybean crop. Excess amounts of water led to the closure of many crab processing plants and crab house restaurants, and officials restricted harvest on shellfish for eleven days due to unsafe impurities in the water.|$|E
25|$|Maize {{spread to}} the rest of the world because of its ability to grow in diverse climates. It was {{cultivated}} in Spain just a few decades after Columbus's voyages and then spread to Italy, West Africa and elsewhere. Sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are usually grown for human consumption as kernels, while <b>field</b> <b>corn</b> varieties are used for animal feed, various corn-based human food uses (including grinding into cornmeal or masa, pressing into corn oil, and fermentation and distillation into alcoholic beverages like bourbon whiskey), and as chemical feedstocks.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} ethanol fuel {{produced}} from <b>field</b> <b>corn</b> was spurred in the U.S. {{by the discovery}} that methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) was contaminating groundwater. MTBE use as an oxygenate additive was widespread due to mandates of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1992 to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. As a result, by 2006 MTBE use in gasoline was banned in almost 20 states. There was also concern that widespread and costly litigation might be taken against the U.S. gasoline suppliers, and a 2005 decision refusing legal protection for MTBE, opened a new market for ethanol fuel, the primary substitute for MTBE. At a time when corn prices were around US$2 a bushel, corn growers recognized the potential of this new market and delivered accordingly. This demand shift took place {{at a time when}} oil prices were already significantly rising.|$|E

More than 20 buildings, a feed lot, soybean <b>fields,</b> <b>corn</b> <b>fields,</b> several roads, 1,500 non-native trees, and 5 mi of fence dotted the site.|$|R

The area had <b>fields,</b> <b>corn</b> <b>fields,</b> and deciduous forests around the swamp. This is why the area was once full of game. The area is inhabited by white tailed deer, gray fox, muskrats, raccoons, skunks, possums and weasels.|$|R
500|$|The {{demand for}} ethanol fuel {{produced}} from <b>field</b> <b>corn</b> in the United States was {{stimulated by the}} discovery in the late 90s that methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), an oxygenate additive in gasoline, was contaminating groundwater. Due to the risks of widespread and costly litigation, and because MTBE use in gasoline was banned in almost 20 states by 2006, the substitution of MTBE opened a new market for ethanol fuel. This demand shift for ethanol as an oxygenate additive took place {{at a time when}} oil prices were already significantly rising. By 2006, about 50 percent of the gasoline used in the U.S. contained ethanol at different proportions, and ethanol production grew so fast that the US became the world's top ethanol producer, [...] Brazil in 2005. This shift also contributed to a sharp increase in the production and sale of E85 flex vehicles since 2002.|$|E

Ethanol also replaces toxic, air-polluting substances such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. Numerous states require certain ethanol blends to reduce air pollution. Ethanol produces about 34% less air pollution than gasoline on average.|$|E
