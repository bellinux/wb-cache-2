5|$|Despite an {{emergency}} appendectomy that delayed his spring training and shortened {{his time to}} get <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> <b>for</b> the season, Hershiser had been named NL Baseball Pitcher of the Month in April and {{a participant in the}} 1988 All-Star Game, getting outs against all three batters. In the eight games he started between July 10 and August 14, Hershiser had a 3–4 win–loss record with a 4.76 earned run average (ERA), raising his season ERA from 2.46 to 3.06. Following his August 14 start in which he left the game after two innings (his shortest appearance since 1985) with the Dodgers behind the Giants 8–2, he pitched complete games on August 19 (a shutout) and August 24. Prior to the game, Hershiser trailed teammate Tim Leary in shutouts, six to three, and Leary also combined with other pitchers to record a shutout that was not counted in his individual total.|$|E

25|$|Gwynn was a two-sport {{star with}} San Diego State, playing three seasons of {{baseball}} {{and four of}} basketball. He was a two-time All-American outfielder in his final two seasons, when he led the team in hitting. A skilled playmaker in basketball, he set multiple school records for assists. He is the only player {{in the history of}} the WAC to earn all-conference honors in two sports. Gwynn was not allowed to play baseball as a freshman. He was overweight at , and Vezie wanted him to get <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> <b>for</b> the next basketball season.|$|E

She also {{underwent}} extensive training to get <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> <b>for</b> the role, including archery, rock and tree climbing, combat, running, parkour, and yoga, and had an accident {{on the last day}} of her six-week training phase, in which she hit a wall while running at full speed, but was not seriously injured. Other stars who dyed their hair for the movie include Josh Hutcherson as Peeta and Liam Hemsworth as Gale. Lionsgate hired Olympic bronze medal-winning archer Khatuna Lorig to teach Lawrence how to shoot.|$|E
25|$|The femur is {{the third}} segment of the insect leg, is usually the longest and strongest part of the limb, but it varies in size from the huge hind femur of leaping Orthoptera to a very small segment such as is present in many larval forms. The volume of the femur is {{generally}} correlated {{with the size of}} the tibial muscles contained within it, but it is sometimes enlarged and modified <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> <b>for</b> other purposes than that of accommodating the tibial muscles. The tibia is characteristically a slender segment in adult insects, only a little shorter than the femur or the combined femur and trochanter. Its proximal end forms a more or less distinct head bent toward the femur, a device allowing the tibia to be flexed close against the under surface of the femur.|$|E

[...] However, he was {{suspended}} in June 1909 by Toronto manager Joe Kelley. [...] A newspaper account on the suspension noted: [...] "Lundgren is not <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> <b>for</b> a hard game, and the Toronto Club {{does not intend to}} pay him a big salary to get into shape when he's not half trying." [...] In August 1909, he was reported to be [...] "pitching independent ball around Chicago." ...|$|E

By 2008, he was wrestling for both NAWA Ring Champions, for which he served as booker at times, and Southern Extreme Championship Wrestling. On January 6, 2008, at SECW's [...] "Bill Dromo Appreciation Night" [...] in Carrollton, he wrestled in a 6-man tag team match with Chick Donovan and Bulldog Raines against Bob Armstrong, Tommy Rich, and Buff Bagwell, losing when his team was disqualified. On February 7, a tag team match with Bulldog Raines against Tommy Rich and Jimmy Powell in Rome for NAWA Ring Champions ended in a double-disqualification. He and Raines lost a match in SECW against Bull Buchanan and Buff Bagwell three days later.|$|E
2500|$|... 1957 {{started to}} show some decline in Lopata's performance. On January 25, he signed a new {{contract}} with the Phillies that reportedly had a [...] "substantial increase." [...] Lopata started being plagued with nagging injuries in July, injuring his shoulder in one game and pulled a muscle {{only a few days}} later. It would take more than two weeks for him to recover enough to start again as catcher. On July 21, he made the most of his return by hitting two solo home runs in a 6–4 defeat against Cincinnati. Lopata finished the month by homering in two consecutive games on July 30 and 31, and continued his streak into August by hitting a homer on August 1 and 2. Despite the surge of power, Lopata's numbers were diminished from his previous all-star year, putting up a [...]237 batting average to go with 18 home runs and 67 RBI in 116 games. Despite the lowered numbers, he still had the best offensive output out of all catchers in the National League. He never did quite get over the knee injury he sustained earlier in the season. In October he was given orders by his doctor to exercise to strengthen his ligaments in his right knee, and began training at Connie Mack Stadium to get back <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> <b>for</b> the upcoming 1958 season.|$|E
2500|$|In reality, {{neither the}} US Army nor US Navy was <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> <b>for</b> war {{in terms of}} manpower, size, {{military}} hardware or experience. The Navy had fine ships but Wilson had been using them to threaten Mexico, and the fleet's readiness had suffered. The crews of the Texas and the New York, the two newest and largest battleships, had never fired a gun, and {{the morale of the}} sailors was low. The Army and Navy air forces were tiny in size. Despite the flood of new weapons systems unveiled in the war in Europe, the Army was paying scant attention. For example, it was making no studies of trench warfare, poison gas or tanks, and was unfamiliar with the rapid evolution of Aerial warfare. The Democrats in Congress tried to cut the military budget in 1915. The Preparedness movement effectively exploited the surge of outrage over the [...] "Lusitania" [...] in May 1915, forcing the Democrats to promise some improvements to the military and naval forces. Wilson, less fearful of the Navy, embraced a long-term building program designed to make the fleet the equal of the British Royal Navy by the mid-1920s, although this would not come to pass until after World War II. [...] "Realism" [...] was at work here; the admirals were Mahanians and they therefore wanted a surface fleet of heavy battleships second to none—that is, equal to Great Britain. The facts of submarine warfare (which necessitated destroyers, not battleships) and the possibilities of imminent war with Germany (or with Britain, for that matter), were simply ignored.|$|E
