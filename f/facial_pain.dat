40|$|The attentional {{demand of}} pain has {{primarily}} been investigated within an intrapersonal context. Little {{is known about}} observers' attentional processing of another's pain. The present study investigated, within a sample of parents (n = 65; 51 mothers, 14 fathers) of school children, parental selective attention to children's <b>facial</b> display of <b>pain</b> and the moderating role of child's <b>facial</b> expressiveness of <b>pain</b> and parental catastrophizing about their child's pain. Parents performed a dot-probe task in which child <b>facial</b> display of <b>pain</b> (of varying pain expressiveness) were presented. Findings provided evidence of parental selective attention to child <b>pain</b> displays. Low <b>facial</b> displays of <b>pain</b> appeared sufficiently and also, as compared with higher <b>facial</b> displays of <b>pain,</b> equally capable of engaging parents' attention {{to the location of}} threat. Severity of <b>facial</b> displays of <b>pain</b> had a nonspatial effect on attention; that is, there was increased interference (ie, delayed responding) with increasing facial expressiveness. This interference effect was particularly pronounced for high-catastrophizing parents, suggesting that being confronted with increasing child pain displays becomes particularly demanding for high-catastrophizing parents. Finally, parents with higher levels of catastrophizing increasingly attended away from low pain expressions, whereas selective attention to high-pain expressions did not differ between high-catastrophizing and low-catastrophizing parents. Theoretical implications and further research directions are discussed. Parental attentional processing of child pain is dependent on parental catastrophizing about the child's <b>pain,</b> child <b>facial</b> expressiveness of <b>pain,</b> and the interaction between the two. © 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of various types of intractable head and <b>facial</b> <b>pains.</b> Seven patients underwent the insertion of DBS electrodes into the periventricular/periaqueductal grey region and/or the ventroposteromedial nucleus of the thalamus. We have shown statistically significant improvement in pain scores (visual analogue and McGill's) as well as health-related quality of life (SF- 36 v 2) following surgery.

40|$|Pain {{behaviors}} {{are shaped by}} social demands and learning processes, and chronic pain has been previously suggested to affect their meaning. In this study, we combined {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} with in-scanner video recording during thermal pain stimulations and use multilevel mediation analyses to study the brain mediators of <b>pain</b> <b>facial</b> expressions and the perception of pain intensity (self-reports) in healthy individuals and patients with chronic back pain (CBP). Behavioral data showed that the relation between pain expression and pain report was disrupted in CBP. In both patients with CBP and healthy controls, brain activity varying on a trial-by-trial basis with <b>pain</b> <b>facial</b> expressions was mainly located in the primary motor cortex and completely dissociated from the pattern of brain activity varying with pain intensity ratings. Stronger activity was observed in CBP specifically during <b>pain</b> <b>facial</b> expressions in several nonmotor brain regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the medial temporal lobe. In sharp contrast, no moderating effect of chronic pain was observed on brain activity associated with pain intensity ratings. Our results demonstrate that <b>pain</b> <b>facial</b> expressions and <b>pain</b> intensity ratings reflect different aspects of pain processing and support psychosocial models of pain suggesting that distinctive mechanisms are involved in the regulation of pain behaviors in chronic pain...|$|R
40|$|Background: Trigeminal {{neuralgia}} (TN) is {{also known}} as prosoplasia it is also termed as a Suicidal disease or Fothergill disease. The neuropathic condition is characterized by recurrent episodes of <b>facial</b> <b>pains</b> which are triggered by touch, chewing and shaving. The pain initiates from the 5 th cranial nerve which is known as trigeminal nerve. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate treatment protocol used by physiotherapist for trigeminal neuralgia patients. Methods: It was cross-sectional descriptive study in which data was collected from certified physiotherapists working in private/ government hospitals for more than 1 year in Karachi.

25|$|Osteonecrosis {{can affect}} any bone, but the hips, knees and jaws {{are most often}} involved. Pain can often be severe, {{especially}} if teeth and/or {{a branch of the}} trigeminal nerve is involved, but many patients do not experience pain, at least in the earlier stages. When severe <b>facial</b> <b>pain</b> is purported to be caused by osteonecrosis, the term NICO, for neuralgia-inducing cavitational osteonecrosis, is sometimes used, but this is controversial and far from completely understood.|$|E
25|$|Major {{complications}} {{of the condition}} are chronic loss of taste (ageusia), chronic facial spasm, <b>facial</b> <b>pain</b> and corneal infections. To prevent the latter, the eyes may be protected by covers, or taped shut during sleep and for rest periods, and tear-like eye drops or eye ointments may be recommended, especially for cases with complete paralysis. Where the eye does not close completely, the blink reflex is also affected, and {{care must be taken}} to protect the eye from injury.|$|E
500|$|Painful {{conditions}} {{which do not}} originate from the teeth or their supporting structures may affect the oral mucosa of the gums and be interpreted by the individual as toothache. Examples include neoplasms of the gingival or alveolar mucosa (usually squamous cell carcinoma), {{conditions which}} cause gingivostomatitis and desquamative gingivitis. Various conditions may involve the alveolar bone, and cause non-odontogenic toothache, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, infarcts in the jaws caused by sickle cell disease, and osteomyelitis. Various conditions of the trigeminal nerve can masquerade as toothache, including trigeminal zoster (maxillary or mandibular division), trigeminal neuralgia, cluster headache, and trigeminal neuropathies. Very rarely, a brain tumor might cause toothache. Another chronic <b>facial</b> <b>pain</b> syndrome which can mimic toothache is temporomandibular disorder (temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunction syndrome), which is very common. [...] Toothache which has no identifiable dental or medical cause is often termed atypical odontalgia, which, in turn, is usually considered a type of atypical <b>facial</b> <b>pain</b> (or persistent idiopathic <b>facial</b> <b>pain).</b> Atypical odontalgia may give very unusual symptoms, such as pain which migrates from one tooth to another and which crosses anatomical boundaries (such as from the left teeth to the right teeth).|$|E
40|$|Although {{depression}} {{is associated with}} more clinical pain complaints, psychophysical data sometimes point to hypoalgesic alterations. Studying the more reflex-like <b>facial</b> expression of <b>pain</b> in patients with depression may offer a new perspective. Facial and psychophysical responses to nonpainful and painful heat stimuli were studied in 23 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 23 matched control participants. As psychophysical data, pain thresholds, tolerance thresholds, and self-report were assessed. Facial responses were videotaped and subjected offline to Facial Action Coding System analysis. One of the key <b>facial</b> responses of <b>pain,</b> which is a known facial signal of negative affect (contraction of the eyebrows), was significantly increased in MDD patients. Moreover, <b>facial</b> expressions and <b>pain</b> ratings were strongly correlated in MDD patients, whereas these 2 response systems were in line with established findings only weakly related in healthy participants. Pain psychophysics was unaltered in MDD patients compared with healthy control participants. In conclusion, the <b>facial</b> expression of <b>pain</b> in MDD patients indicates rather hyper- than hypoalgesia, with enhanced affective pain processing. Moreover, the linkage between subjective and facial responses was much stronger in MDD patients, which {{may be due to}} a reduced influence of social display rules, which normally complicate this relationship. Perspective: The <b>facial</b> expression of <b>pain</b> in patients with depression indicates stronger affective pain processing and stronger association with self-report than in healthy individuals.

40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} value of fever and <b>facial</b> and dental <b>pain</b> in adults suspected of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Data Sources PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Review Methods A comprehensive systematic search {{was performed on}} March 18, 2013. We included articles reporting studies on the diagnostic value of fever or <b>facial</b> and dental <b>pain</b> in patients suspected of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. For included articles, the reported study design was assessed for directness of evidence and risk of bias. Prevalences, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values were extracted. Results Of 3171 unique records, we included 1 study with a high directness of evidence and a moderate risk of bias. The prior probability of bacterial rhinosinusitis was 0. 29 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 24 to 0. 35). We could not extract posterior probabilities with accompanying positive and negative predictive values. The study reported an odds ratio from univariate analysis for fever of 1. 02 (0. 52 to 2. 00) and 1. 65 (0. 83 to 3. 28) for <b>facial</b> and dental <b>pain.</b> In subsequent multivariate analysis, the odds ratio of <b>facial</b> and dental <b>pain</b> was 1. 86 (1. 06 to 3. 29). Conclusion and Recommendation There is 1 study with moderate risk of bias, reporting data {{in such a manner}} that we could not assess the value of fever and <b>facial</b> and dental <b>pain</b> in adults suspected of an acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Therefore, these symptoms should not be used in clinical practice to distinguish between a bacterial and viral source of acute rhinosinusitis or for decision making about prescribing antibiotic treatment...|$|R
500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of toothache can be challenging, {{not only because}} the list of potential causes is extensive, but also because dental pain may be extremely variable, and pain can be referred to and from the teeth. Dental pain can simulate virtually any <b>facial</b> <b>pain</b> syndrome. However, the vast majority of toothache is caused by dental, rather than non-dental, sources. Consequently, the saying [...] "horses, not zebras" [...] has been applied to the differential {{diagnosis of}} orofacial pain. That is, everyday dental causes (such as pulpitis) should always be considered before unusual, non-dental causes (such as myocardial infarction). In the wider context of orofacial pain, all cases of orofacial pain may be considered as having a dental origin until proven otherwise. The diagnostic approach for toothache is generally carried out in the following sequence: history, followed by examination, and investigations. All this information is then collated and used to build a clinical picture, and a differential diagnosis can be carried out.|$|E

2500|$|By {{definition}} {{chronic sinusitis}} lasts longer {{than three months}} and {{can be caused by}} many different diseases that share chronic inflammation of the sinuses as a common symptom. Symptoms of chronic sinusitis may include any combination of the following: nasal congestion, <b>facial</b> <b>pain,</b> headache, night-time coughing, an increase in previously minor or controlled asthma symptoms, general malaise, thick green or yellow discharge, feeling of facial 'fullness' or 'tightness' that may worsen when bending over, dizziness, aching teeth, and/or bad breath. Each of these symptoms has multiple other possible causes, which should be considered and investigated as well. [...] Often chronic sinusitis can lead to anosmia, the inability to smell objects. In a small number of cases, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis is associated with a dental infection. Vertigo, lightheadedness, and blurred vision are not typical in chronic sinusitis and other causes should be investigated.|$|E
40|$|Painful facial {{expressions}} {{have been shown}} to trigger affective responses among observers. However, there is so far no clear indication about the self- or other-oriented nature of these feelings. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess whether <b>facial</b> expressions of <b>pain</b> are unconsciously associated with other-oriented feelings (empathic concern) or with self-oriented feelings (personal distress). 70 participants took part in a priming paradigm in which ambiguous <b>facial</b> expressions of <b>pain</b> were primed by words related to empathic concern, distress, negative or by neutral words. It was hypothesized that empathic concern or distress-related words might facilitate the detection of <b>pain</b> in ambiguous <b>facial</b> expressions of <b>pain,</b> independently of a mere effect of prime (i. e., neutral words) or an effect of valence congruency (negative primes). The results showed an effect of prime on the detection and on the reaction time to answer "pain" when confronted to ambiguous <b>facial</b> expressions of <b>pain.</b> More specifically, the detection of pain was higher and faster when preceded by distress primes relative to either neutral or negative primes. The present study suggests that painful expressions are unconsciously related to self-oriented feelings of distress and that their threat value might account for this effect. These findings thus shed new light on the automatic relationship between painful expressions and the affective components of empathy...|$|R
40|$|IF 4. 84] Contact heat stimuli {{have been}} {{reported}} to excite mechano-thermal nociceptors and to evoke brain potentials (CHEPs) from the limbs. We investigated whether contact heat evokes reproducible CHEPs from the trigeminal territory and may prove a reliable diagnostic tool in <b>facial</b> neuropathic <b>pain.</b> We applied contact heat stimuli to the perioral and supraorbital regions; CHEPs were recorded from the vertex in 20 controls and 2 patients with <b>facial</b> neuropathic <b>pains,</b> and reflex responses from the orbicularis oculi and masticatory muscles in 5 controls. We studied the correlation between CHEP data and perceptive ratings, site of stimulation, and age. Finally, we compared CHEPs with laser evoked potentials (LEPs). Contact heat stimuli at 51 C evoked vertex potentials consisting of an NP complex similar to that elicited by laser pulses, though with a latency some 100 -ms longer. Perioral stimulation yielded higher pain intensity ratings, shorter latency and larger amplitude CHEPs than supraorbital stimulation. CHEP data correlated significantly with age. Contact heat stimuli at 53 C evoked a blink-like response in the relaxed orbicularis oculi muscle and a silent period in the contracted masseter muscle. In patients with <b>facial</b> neuropathic <b>pain</b> the CHEP abnormalities paralleled those seen with LEPs. We were unable to achieve reproducible signals related to C-receptor stimulation by contact heat stimuli at 41 C in the ten subjects in whom they were tested. Contact heat stimulation, as well as laser stimulation, easily yields large-amplitude brain potentials and nociceptive reflexes, both related to the Ad input. However CHEPs are not suitable for C-fibres potentials recording...|$|R

40|$|Although {{research}} on <b>facial</b> expressions of <b>pain</b> {{has a long}} history, {{little is known about}} the cerebral mechanisms regulating these expressions. It has been suggested that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) might be involved in regulating/inhibiting the degree to which-pain is facially displayed. To test whether such a prefrontal regulation does indeed take place, we reduced medial prefrontal excitability via repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and assessed its effect on facial expressions. In a within-subject design, facial and subjective responses to experimental pain as well as "situational" pain, catastrophizing were assessed in 35 healthy participants; once after receiving low-frequency rTMS over the mPFC (1 Hz) and once after sham stimulation. Compared with sham stimulation, rTMS over the mPFC resulted in enhanced <b>facial</b> expressions of <b>pain,</b> whereas self-report and pain catastrophizing did not change. The current data show that reducing medial prefrontal excitability (via low-frequency rTMS) makes individuals facially more expressive to pain. This finding indicates that the mPFC is crucially involved in the inhibition of <b>facial</b> expressions of <b>pain.</b> Because this effect was independent of changes in self-report and pain catastrophizing suggests that this inhibitory mechanism is mainly governing the facial expression and not the underlying experience of pain. Perspective: Using rTMS, it was shown that the mPFC is causally involved in the downregulation or silencing of one's <b>facial</b> expression of <b>pain.</b> This might explain why individuals with low mPFC functioning (eg, patients with dementia) are facially more expressive in response to pain.
