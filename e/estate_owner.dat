40|$|This degree {{projects}} made {{on behalf}} of AB Karl Hedin {{to find out what}} private forest <b>estate</b> <b>owners</b> would like to have on a forestry-related website. The reason for finding out what <b>estate</b> <b>owners</b> think of the forest websites is to meet needs of the forest owners who are customers of AB Karl Hedin. Marketing and use of the Internet for information search for products and services are two key concepts in this study. To be able to perform the study, a telephone survey was made to find out what <b>estate</b> <b>owners</b> want and what they are missing on a forest site. The survey can be summarized at following conclusion: The marketing of AB Karl Hedin website must be stronger The forest owners want more information on forest business, prices and forestry services.

He had two siblings, Bernhard (1810–1893) and Malwine (1827–1908). The world saw Bismarck as a typical Prussian Junker, an image that he encouraged by wearing military uniforms. Bismarck was well educated and cosmopolitan with a gift for conversation. In addition to his native German, he was fluent in English, French, Italian, Polish and Russian.|$|E

Boström served as Prime Minister in 1891–1900 and 1902–1905. He was trusted and respected by the king, who had much difficulty approving someone else as prime minister. Over a period of time, the king gave Boström a free hand to select his own ministers without much royal involvement.

25|$|The city’s oldest market {{structure}} still in use, Hollins Market {{is part of}} the Baltimore public market system that began in 1763. In 1835, the City granted a petition of piano manufacturer Joseph Newman and “others” to erect a market house at their own expense. Banker George T. Dunbar donated the land which, at that time, was on the western fringe of the city. The doors opened in September 1836 and the market soon became very successful, but the fragile structure blew down in a windstorm two years later. Newman organized the effort to quickly rebuild and re-open the market by the end of 1839. The market was named for John Smith Hollins (1786–1856), an <b>estate</b> <b>owner</b> in West Baltimore and one-term mayor of the city from 1852 to 1854.|$|E
25|$|European owners wanted rent in cash, kind or labour {{at their}} {{discretion}} {{and the ability}} to select tenants and workers and evict those they did not want, without reference to any customs that restricted these objectives. Africans wanted to occupy estate land under the same conditions as Trust Land: rent-free, without any obligation to provide labour or sell crops to the <b>estate</b> <b>owner,</b> and following traditional customs. Abrahams saw these views as irreconcilable and considered that African residents in estates should be “emancipated”, free to leave the estate and be resettled on Trust Land or to stay on terms negotiated with the owner, not imposed by legislation. This could not be done while much Native Trust Land was overcrowded, so the unused and under-used estate land needed to be acquired for the re-settlement of those leaving estates and also to accommodate some of the excess population already on Trust Land. Abrahams thought that the majority of estate residents would choose to leave, so the owners could then develop the remaining largely unoccupied parts of their estates.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis of}} estate {{agriculture}} in Nyasaland {{for much of}} the colonial period was the system of thangata which, in the early colonial period, meant that African on estates had to perform agricultural labour in lieu of the rent for a plot of land on which they could grow food. At first, estates usually required two months’ labour a year from adult men, one month for rent, the second for Hut tax. However, on some estates the obligations of labour tenants were extended, and abuses such as requiring 30 days work (five weeks of six days) for each month of thangata or requiring that women heading households should work were introduced. The demand for estate labour declined in the 1920s, and British Central Africa Company was the first <b>estate</b> <b>owner</b> to modify thangata. The company issued seed to African tenants so that they could grow cotton or tobacco under supervision, and then sell their crops to the company at low prices. The Natives on Private Estates Ordinance 1928 formalised this arrangement by allowing landlords to receive rents in cash, in a fixed quantity of acceptable crops or by direct labour. The term thangata applied both to rent in kind, common on tobacco and cotton estates, and to the older form of labour thangata, which persisted on the tea estates that required direct labour.|$|E

25|$|In 1785 Fitzwilliam {{had been}} {{depicted}} in a magnificent portrait in oils by the leading painter of the day, Sir Joshua Reynolds, President of the Royal Academy, an engraving of which, by Joseph Grozer dated 1786, is shown here. The portrait, with its turbulent sky, alludes {{to both the}} emotional turmoil the Earl had relatively recently suffered {{on the death of}} his uncle, Rockingham, and the political turmoil in which he had become embroiled following the dismissal of Fox and North from government at the end of 1783. Set in a landscape background, it also alludes to Fitzwilliam's wider responsibilities, which extended beyond the Parliamentary debating chamber. As Ernest Smith has perceptively noted, 'Fitzwilliam grew up to be the typical eighteenth-century aristocrat – a man to whom politics was a natural responsibility due to his order, his family and his country, but not a field for the display of ambition. He was always fonder of the country than the town, of the local rather than the national arena. He saw his role throughout his life as that of leader of his local society and a link between the party and the public...Fitzwilliam's world...was that of the great <b>estate</b> <b>owner....</b> Agents, tenantry, mortgages, leases and properties were his daily concern, and to these his life had in some measure to be dedicated.' The portrait of Fitzwilliam by Reynolds had been missing since 1920 and was rediscovered in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Street and {{his wife}} Narcissa Vanderlip were from wealthy families. She was the {{daughter}} of Frank and Narcissa Cox Vanderlip, who lived at Beechwood in Briarcliff Manor; Vanderlip was the president of the National City Bank from 1909 to 1919. Narcissa Vanderlip attended the Scarborough School, graduated from Vassar College in 1925, and {{was a member of the}} Junior League; while her husband, Julian Street Jr., graduated from Princeton University in 1925 where he was the editorial chairman for The Daily Princetonian—by 1925, he was on the staff of The New York Herald Tribune. Julian Street Jr. was the son of notable author Julian Street, who wrote such works as Abroad at Home (1914), Mysterious Japan (1921), Rita Coventry (1922), and Where Paris Dines (1929). Street Jr. was working as a scriptwriter for NBC, where he adapted Booth Tarkington's Penrod for broadcasting, the first popular book to be formatted for broadcast purposes. Both Narcissa and Julian Street Jr. were the children of wealthy Gilded Age American families, and it was not surprising that they later married. Their parents were connected, as Frank Vanderlip, Narcissa's father, knew Julian Street Jr.'s father since the Bank Panic of 1907, when Frank helped Street keep his money safe with National City Bank. The Streets were married in April 1927 in a lavish ceremony at the New Church, a Georgian building on 35th Street in New York City; at their reception, held at the Colony Club, more than 1,500 guests attended, including Goulds, Vanderbilts and Roosevelts. After their marriage, Edward Walker Harden, a Briarcliff Manor <b>estate</b> <b>owner</b> and longtime friend of Frank Vanderlip, gave land on the east side of Sleepy Hollow Road in Briarcliff Manor to the Streets. The Streets, however, preferred the land that was already owned by the Vanderlips on Long Hill Road West, which was more private and secluded, so they sold the land given by Harden. According to a map from October 6, 1937, Street's mother-in-law owned the land on which the Streets' new house, designed by Wallace K. Harrison, was built.|$|E

In relating the downfall of an aristocratic family in the Commonwealth's valley, it drew upon his personal witness of the financial ruin of his in-laws, the family of Charles Carter, and described the inability of an <b>estate</b> <b>owner</b> to manage his monetary affairs, such as he had personally experienced. Tucker further used the novel's characters, again reflecting personal experience, to emphasize that happiness in love and life resulted from the moderation of one's passions. The Valley stressed Tucker's professorial objective, that history must inform the reader with [...] "the progress of society and the arts of civilization; with the advancement and decline of literature, laws, manners and commerce." [...] He also conveyed through the fiction his view that gentility was independent of wealth, {{that the relationship between}} masters and slaves was imbued with mutual trust and happiness, and that the strong currents of socio-economic change were on the whole beneficent.|$|E
