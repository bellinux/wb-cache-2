5|$|A general {{application}} of matrices in physics {{is to the}} description of linearly coupled harmonic systems. The equations of motion of such systems {{can be described in}} matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial {{when it comes to the}} internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations <b>in</b> <b>electrical</b> circuits.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Adams Township High School, Verville took a {{correspondence}} course <b>in</b> <b>electrical</b> engineering. He moved to Detroit, Michigan {{at the age}} of twenty, and from 1910 to 1913 he worked in the electrical departments of the Detroit Edison Company, Ford Motor Company, and Hudson Motor Car Company. By 1913, Verville had made his mind up that he wanted to learn to fly. William Edmund Scripps, the editor and owner of The Detroit News, introduced Verville to Glenn Curtiss in July 1913. Curtiss encouraged Verville to apply for his Spring 1914 flight school. Instead, Verville went to Hammondsport, New York in February 1914, where Curtiss Aeroplane Company was located, and told Curtiss he wanted to work as an apprentice in his drafting and engineering shop. Curtiss agreed and this began Verville's aviation career.|$|E
5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates <b>in</b> <b>electrical</b> terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence {{mechanical component}}s are resonators {{and are often}} used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance of the piece.|$|E
