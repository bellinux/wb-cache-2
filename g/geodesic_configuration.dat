25|$|In {{materials}} science, {{and especially}} elasticity theory, ideas of torsion also {{play an important}} role. One problem models the growth of vines, focusing {{on the question of}} how vines manage to twist around objects. The vine itself is modeled as a pair of elastic filaments twisted around one another. In its energy-minimizing state, the vine naturally grows {{in the shape of a}} helix. But the vine may also be stretched out to maximize its extent (or length). In this case, the torsion of the vine is related to the torsion of the pair of filaments (or equivalently the surface torsion of the ribbon connecting the filaments), and it reflects the difference between the length-maximizing (<b>geodesic)</b> <b>configuration</b> of the vine and its energy-minimizing configuration.|$|E

40|$|This article {{contains}} a detailed study, in the toric case, of the test <b>configuration</b> <b>geodesic</b> rays defined by Phong-Sturm. We show that the `Bergman approximations' of Phong-Sturm converge in C^ 1 to the geodesic ray and that the geodesic ray itself is C^ 1, 1 and no better. The metrics associated to the geodesic ray of potentials are discontinuous across certain hypersurfaces and are degenerate on certain open sets. A novelty in the analysis is the connection between Bergman metrics, Bergman kernels and the theory of large deviations. Comment: 42 pages, no figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We study supersymmetric probe M 5 -branes in the AdS 4 {{solution}} that arises from M 5 -branes wrapped on a hyperbolic 3 -manifold M 3. This amounts to introducing internal defects {{within the framework}} of the 3 d- 3 d correspondence. The BPS condition for a probe M 5 -brane extending along all of AdS 4 requires it to wrap a surface embedded in an S 2 -fibration over M 3. We find that the projection of this surface to M 3 can be either a geodesic or a tubular surface around a <b>geodesic.</b> These <b>configurations</b> preserve an extra U(1) symmetry, in addition to the one corresponding to the R-symmetry of the dual 3 d N = 2 gauge theory. BPS M 2 -branes can stretch between M 5 -branes wrapping geodesics. We interpret the addition of probe M 5 -branes on a closed geodesic in terms of conformal Dehn surgery. ar X i...|$|R
40|$|We use {{so-called}} geometrical {{approach in}} description of transition from regular motion to chaotic in Hamiltonian systems with potential energy surface that has several local minima. Distinctive feature of such systems is coexistence {{of different types}} of dynamics (regular or chaotic) in different wells at the same energy Mixed state reveals unique opportunities in research of quantum manifestations of classical stochasticity. Application of traditional criteria for transition to chaos (resonance overlap criterion, negative curvature criterion and stochastic layer destruction criterion) is inefficient in case of potentials with complex topology. Geometrical approach allows considering only configuration space but not phase space when investigating stability. Trajectories are viewed as <b>geodesics</b> of <b>configuration</b> space equipped with suitable metric. In this approach all information about chaos and regularity consists in potential function. The aim of this work is to determine what details of geometry of potential lead to chaos in Hamiltonian systems using geometrical approach. Numerical calculations are executed for potentials that are relevant with lowest umbilical catastrophes.

40|$|During {{numerous}} biological processes, cell adhesion, {{cell migration}} and cell spreading are vital. These basic biological functions are {{regulated by the}} interaction of cells with their extracellular environment. To examine the morphology and mechanical changes occurring in mesenchymal stem cells cultured on a mechanically rigid substrate, atomic force microscopy and fluorescence microscopy were employed. Investigations of the cells revealed both linear and <b>geodesic</b> F-actin <b>configurations.</b> No particular cell characteristics or intra-cellular location were implicated in {{the appearance of the}} geodesic structures. However, the length of time the cells were cultured on the substrate correlated with the percentage appearance of the geodesic structures. Calculating energy dissipation from cell images acquired by dynamic mode atomic force microscopy, it was observed that the vertices of the geodesic structures had significantly higher energy dissipation compared to the linear F-actin and the glass. This supports work by Lazarides [J. Cell Biol. 68, 202 – 219 (1976) ], who postulated that the vertices of these geodesic structures should have a greater flexibility. Our results also support predictions based on the microfilament tensegrity model. By understanding the basic principles of cell ultrastructure and cell mechanics in relation to different extracellular environments, a better understanding of physiological and pathological process will be elicited...|$|R
40|$|Obstacles in an {{environment}} inherently affect the its geometry. A straight line between two points is no longer optimal and {{may not even be}} feasible. This paper explores that idea directly and develops algorithms to learn and efficiently leverage the underlying geometry of the environment for planning and control. Specifically, we uncover a problem’s geometry by formulating the problem as one of finding a diffeomorphism (smooth and invertible mapping) from the configuration space to a latent Euclidean space where curved <b>geodesics</b> in the <b>configuration</b> space map to well understood and computationally efficient straight lines in the latent space. Diffeomorphisms in this context act to reduce more complex problems to simpler more fundamental and easily controlled ones. We provided some preliminary experimental results using these techniques and discuss their advantages, limitations, and generalizations. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we introduce, develop and discuss the {{theoretical}} calculations required for the exact solution of a recently reported transition, the geodesic to zigzag transition. In this scenario the interfacial transition emerges from geometric competition between a <b>geodesic,</b> shortest path, <b>configuration</b> and a zigzag configuration which is able to reduce its energy by binding to a centrally positioned defect line. From a technical point of view the transition is unusual as it is described by a change from saddle dominated behavior to pole dominated behavior of the integral representing the partition function ratio. We also establish the precise fluctuation behavior of the interface by computing the spin magnetization {{at any point in}} the system. Citation: Abraham, D. B., Mustonen, V. & Wood, A. J. (2005).

40|$|The higher {{performance}} of relaxor-based piezocrystals compared with piezoceramics is now well established, notably including improved gain-bandwidth product, and these materials {{have been adopted}} widely for biomedical ultrasound imaging. However, their use in other applications, for example {{as a source of}} focused ultrasound for targeted drug delivery, is hindered in several ways. One of the issues, which we consider here, is in shaping the material into the spherical geometries used widely in focused ultrasound. Unlike isotropic unpoled piezoceramics that can be shaped into a monolithic bowl then poled through the thickness, the anisotropic structure of piezocrystals make it impossible to machine the bulk crystalline material into a bowl without sacrificing performance. Instead, we report a novel faceted array, inspired by the geodesic dome structure in architecture, which utilizes flat piezocrystal material and maximizes fill factor. Aided by 3 D printing, a prototype with f# ≈ 1. 2, containing 96 individually addressable elements was manufactured using 1 - 3 connectivity PMN-PT piezocrystal - epoxy composite. The fabrication process is presented and the array was connected to a 32 -channel controller to shape and steer the beam for preliminary performance demonstration. At an operating frequency of 1 MHz, a focusing gain around 30 was achieved and the side lobe intensities were all at levels below - 12 dB compared to main beam. We conclude that, by taking advantage of contemporary fabrication techniques and driving instrumentation, the <b>geodesic</b> array <b>configuration</b> is suitable for focused ultrasound devices made with piezocrystal...|$|R
40|$|Geometrization of {{dynamics}} {{consists of}} representing trajectories by <b>geodesics</b> on a <b>configuration</b> {{space with a}} suitably defined metric. Previously, {{efforts were made to}} show that the analysis of dynamical stability can also be carried out within geometrical frameworks, by measuring the broadening rate of a bundle of geodesics. Two known formalisms are via Jacobi and Eisenhart metrics. We find that this geometrical analysis measures the actual stability when the length of any geodesic is proportional to the corresponding time interval. We prove that the Jacobi metric is not always an appropriate parametrization by showing that it predicts chaotic behavior for a system of harmonic oscillators. Furthermore, we show, by explicit calculation, that the correspondence between dynamical- and geometrical-spread is ill-defined for the Jacobi metric. We find that the Eisenhart dynamics corresponds to the actual tangent dynamics and is therefore an appropriate geometrization scheme.

40|$|The {{chain of}} events usually {{understood}} {{to lead to the}} formation of topological defects during phase transitions is known as the Kibble mechanism. A central component of the mechanism is the so-called ``geodesic rule''. Although in the Abelian Higgs model the validity of the geodesic rule has been questioned recently, it is known to be valid on energetic grounds for a global U(1) symmetry breaking transition. However, even for these globally symmetric models no dynamical analisys of the rule has been carried to this date, and some points as to how events proceed still remain obscure. This paper tries to clarify the dynamics of the geodesic rule {{in the context of a}} global U(1) model. With an appropriate ansatz for the field modulus we find a family of analytical expressions, phase walls, that accounts for both <b>geodesic</b> and nongeodesic <b>configurations.</b> We then show how the latter ones are unstable and decay into the former by nucleating pairs of defects. Finnally, we try to give a physical perspective of how the geodesic rule might really work in these transitions. Comment: 10 pages, 9 multiple figre...|$|R
40|$|A guiding {{principle}} in Kähler geometry {{is that the}} infinite dimensional symmetric space H of Kähler metrics in a fixed Kähler class on a polarized projective Kähler manifold M should be well approximated by finite dimensional submanifolds Bk ⊂ H of Bergman metrics of height k (Yau, Tian, Donaldson). The Bergman metric spaces are symmetric spaces of type GC/G where G = U(dk + 1) for certain dk. This article establishes the basic estimates for Bergman approximations for geometric families of toric Kähler manifolds. The approximation results are applied to the endpoint problem for geodesics of H, which are solutions of a homogeneous complex Monge-Ampère equation in A × X, where A ⊂ C is an annulus. Donaldson, Arezzo-Tian and Phong-Sturm raised the question whether H-geodesics with fixed endpoints can be approximated by geodesics of Bk. Phong-Sturm proved weak C 0 -convergence of Bergman to Monge-Ampère geodesics on a general Kähler manifold. Our approximation results show that one has C 2 (A × X) convergence {{in the case of}} toric Kähler metrics, extending our earlier result on CP 1. In subsequent papers, the techniques of this article are applied to approximations for harmonic maps into H, to test <b>configuration</b> <b>geodesic</b> rays and to the smooth initial valu...|$|R
40|$|This thesis treats two {{separate}} problems. The first concerns the transverse vibrations of a beam {{and of a}} thin rectangular flat plate. These vibrations {{are associated with a}} function space which has the properties of a generalized "Riemannian" function space. The geodesics of this space are shown to play a role analogous to that played by the <b>geodesics</b> of the <b>configuration</b> space in the classical treatment of the finite dimensional case. Part I is introductory and treats a few aspects of the vibrations of beams with various end conditions under a change of parameter. Part II develops the integro-differential equation for the thin rectangular flat plate. The associated function space and its geodesics are then studied in some detail. The space is found to be not one of constant Riemannian curvature. An example is worked out to illustrate the ideas, and an extension is suggested. The second problem (part III) considers the equations of motion of hydrodynamics of viscous flow with moving axes. Use is made of the space of a kinetic metric introduced by McVittie, who considered non-viscous flow only. The Newtonian equations are obtained by taking certain approximations. The equations of motion in terms of the vorticity tensor are developed. Two examples are discussed illustrating the theory, one concerning instability necessary for tropical cyclones...|$|R
40|$|Following Jacobi’s geometrization of Lagrange’s least action principle, {{trajectories of}} {{classical}} mechanics {{can be characterized}} as <b>geodesics</b> on the <b>configuration</b> space M with respect to a suitable metric which is the conformal modification of the kinematic metric by the factor (U + h), where U and h is the potential function and total energy, respectively. In the special case of 3 -body motions with zero angular momentum, the global geometry of such trajectories can be reduced to that of their moduli curves, which record the change of size and shape, in the moduli space of oriented m-triangles, whose kinematic metric is, in fact, a Riemannian cone over the shape space M ∗ ≃ S 2 (1 / 2). In this paper, we show that the moduli curve of such a motion is uniquely determined by its shape curve (which only records the change of shape) in the case of h = 0, while in the special case of h = 0 it is uniquely determined up to scaling. Thus, the study of the global geometry of such motions can be further reduced to that of the shape curves, which are time-parametrized curves on the 2 -sphere characterized by a third order ODE (cf. Theorem 3. 9). Moreover, these curves have two remarkable properties, namely the uniqueness of parametrization and the monotonicity, as stated in Theorem 4. 6 and Theorem 5. 8, that constitute a solid foundation for a systematic study of their global geometry and naturally lead to the formulation of some pertinent problems such as those briefly discussed in § 7.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} results which have been {{recently}} obtained by applying mathematical concepts drawn, in particular, from differential geometry and topology, to the physics of Hamiltonian dynamical systems with many degrees of freedom of interest for statistical mechanics. The {{first part of the}} paper concerns the applications of methods used in classical differential geometry to study the chaotic dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. Starting from the identity between the trajectories of a dynamical system and the <b>geodesics</b> in its <b>configuration</b> space, a geometric theory of chaotic dynamics can be developed, which sheds new light on the origin of chaos in Hamiltonian systems. In fact, it appears that chaos can be induced not only by negative curvatures, as was originally surmised, but also by positive curvatures, provided the curvatures are fluctuating along the geodesics. In the case of a system with a large number of degrees of freedom it is possible to give an analytical estimate of the largest Lyapunov exponent by means of a geometric model independent of the dynamics. In {{the second part of the}} paper the phenomenon of phase transitions is addressed and it is here that topology comes into play. In fact, when a system undergoes a phase transition, the fluctuations of the configuration-space curvature exhibit a singular behavior at the phase transition point, which can be qualitatively reproduced using geometric models. In these models the origin of the singular behavior of the curvature fluctuations appears to be caused by a topological transition in configuration space. This leads us to put forward a Topological Hypothesis (TH). The content of the TH is that phase transitions would be related at a deeper level to a change in the topology of the configuration space of the system.
