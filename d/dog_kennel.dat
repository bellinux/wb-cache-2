2500|$|Joseph Rocha {{joined the}} United States Navy {{at the age}} of 18. He arrived in Bahrain in February 2005 and was {{assigned}} to the Military Working Dog unit. Rocha, who is gay but states he adhered to the military's [...] "don't ask, don't tell" [...] (DADT) policy while assigned in Bahrain, became the target of hazing. Hazing, which the Navy defines as [...] "any conduct whereby a military member or members, regardless of service or rank, without proper authority causes another military member or members, regardless of service or rank, to suffer or be exposed to any activity which is cruel, abusive, humiliating, oppressive, demeaning or harmful", is a violation of Navy policy. When Rocha refused to patronize female prostitutes, unit commander then Master-At-Arms 2nd Class Michael Toussaint and others in the unit subjected him to anti-gay taunts and slurs. In another incident he was hogtied with duct tape and rope and locked in a <b>dog</b> <b>kennel</b> filled with feces. He was force-fed dog biscuits while his hands and feet were bound. In an incident Rocha describes as [...] "dehumanizing", he was forced to simulate oral sex on another male sailor while being video taped, supposedly as part of a training exercise. Following 28 months of abuse, Rocha left Bahrain and completed an officers' training boot camp. However, the years of mistreatment left Rocha in need of counseling for post-traumatic stress disorder, and his PTSD in combination with the suicide of his former unit's commander, Petty Officer 1st Class Jennifer Valdivia, and his general disillusionment with the military following his ordeal, led to his coming out to his new commanding officer. Rocha received an honorable discharge under DADT in 2007.|$|E

[...] On our return from Belfast we met a sedan--the Duchess of Dunghill. It is no laughing matter though. Imagine the worst <b>dog</b> <b>kennel</b> you ever saw, placed upon two poles from a mouldy fencing--In such a wretched thing sat a squalid old woman, squat like an ape half-starved, from a scarcity of biscuit in its passage from Madagascar to the Cape, with a pipe in her mouth, and looking out with a round-eyed skinny-lidded inanity; with a sort of horizontal idiotic movement of her head--Squat and lean she sat, and puffed out the smoke, while two ragged tattered girls carried her along. What a thing would be a history of her life and sensations; I shall endeavour when I have thought a little more, to give you my idea of the difference between the Scotch and Irish--The two Irishmen I mentioned were speaking of their treatment in England, when the weaver said--"Ah you were a civil man, but I was a drinker." ...|$|E
