Para esto se analizara el manejo actual que tienen las llantas en Bogotá, planteando su flujo y dando a conocer el {{principal}} punto de falencia, que es la recolección y los diferentes sitios de acopio de estas. Los neumáticos o llantas son desechados anualmente en Bogotá sin medir las consecuencias ambientales que esto trae consigo, pues las quemas a cielo abierto de estos materiales y su almacenamiento inadecuado generan altos riesgos para su entorno y el medio ambiente. Además, el manejo inapropiado de llantas es una de las principales razones por la cual pasan a ser obsoletas al poco tiempo de uso. El proceso de fabricación de llantas es muy similar al proceso de cualquier producto, pues en resumen este cuenta con la implementación de sus materias primas, proceso de manufactura, una inspección final y como resultado un producto terminado, que al ser vendido muchas compañías se libran de la disposición final de las llantas. Pero ahí radica un punto a favor para la logística inversa, donde esta buscara la manera de darle un nuevo ciclo de vida a este producto, a través del reciclaje y la reutilización. Mediante esta investigación, se busca captar los principales lugares de acopio de llantas usadas en Bogotá, de manera que estos serán nuestros principales puntos de información para el proyecto, que permita plantear y definir de manera clara estrategias y conclusiones cualitativas. This research seeks from the reverse logistics, show how a product so implemented and rejected by society, can generate a new use, {{and even the}} full reintegration of their premiums to the supply chain materials, showing the close relationship between logistics reverse and reuse oflife products. For this current management with tires in Bogota, raising its flow and publicizing the main point of bankruptcy, which is the collection and the different collection sites these will be analyzed. Tires are discarded annually in Bogotá without considering the environmental consequences that this entails, because the open burning of these materials and their improper storage generate high risks to their surroundings and the environment. In addition, improper <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>tires</b> {{is one of the}} main reasons that become obsolete soon after use. The manufacturing process of tires is very similar to the process of any product, because in all this has the implementation of its raw materials, manufacturing process, final inspection and result in a finished product, which when sold many companies are spared the disposal of tires. But therein lies a plus for reverse logistics, where this look for ways to give new life cycle this product through recycling and reuse. Through this research, it seeks to capture the main gathering places in Bogota used tire, so that these will be our main points of information for the project, which allows raising and clearly define strategies and qualitative conclusions. Demonstrating through internal and external matrices for this sector analysis that the main shortcoming of recycling and reuse of tires is in the way these are collected and stored after use. Starting a collection of data that will lead to raise the supply chain for reverse logistics, showing in turn the different uses and ways of re-manufacturing for tires. Exposing a perspective and different approach to logistics as a means to regulate and reduce waste in the automotive industry, ushering in a new market where its main inputs are products that have already completed their life cycle. They seek to promote fair consumption and sustainability not only the environment, but of all the new business opportunities this can bring.

The proposed friction model is decomposed into {{the product of a}} contact pressure dependent part and a slip velocity dependent part. The identification of the parameters of the slip velocity dependent part, using measured axle forces, is presented in this paper.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{passenger}} comfort, road <b>handling</b> abilities <b>of</b> <b>tires,</b> and vehicle <b>handling</b> characteristics, {{have been the}} major challenge {{in the design of}} suspension system over the years. However, in the past decades various strategies ranging from semi-active to fully active suspension systems had been developed to minimized the unavoidable compromised adopted in the design of passive suspension system, and improve the performance of suspension system. This leads to many research works on active suspension system, with most of them focusing on quarter car model. The quarter car model was mostly used due to its simplicity and proximity in capturing many of the vehicle characteristics. But in order to capture all or most of the vehicle real characteristics, recent studies are focusing on the full car model so that best performance that is very close to real system can be obtained. This project study full car, seven degree of freedom (DOF), suspension system by simulating both passive and active suspension models under two different road profiles. Actuators and controllers were also studied and a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is propose due to its robustness, the Q and R parameters were carefully tune using Brayson’s rule and Trial and error method for best performance. The results obtained confirmed that LQR controllers can reliably ensure system stability, improved road handling abilities and improved overall system performance.

40|$|A new 3 D mathematical-physical tire {{model is}} presented. This model {{considers}} {{not only the}} <b>handling</b> behavior <b>of</b> the <b>tire</b> but also its comfort characteristics, i. e., the dynamic properties in the lateral and the vertical planes. This model {{can be divided into}} two parts, the structural model and the contact area model. The structural parameters are identified by comparison with frequency responses of a 3 D finite element model <b>of</b> the <b>tire,</b> whereas the contact parameters are directly calculated with a finite element model of the tread pattern. The 3 D physical model allows predicting both steady state and transient behavior <b>of</b> the <b>tire</b> without the need of any experimental tests on the tire. The steady state analysis allows obtaining the friction circle diagram, i. e., the plot of the lateral force against the longitudinal force for different slip angles and for longitudinal slip, and the Gough plot, i. e., the diagram of the self-aligning torque versus the lateral force. The transient analysis allows obtaining the dynamic behavior <b>of</b> the <b>tire</b> for any maneuver given to the wheel. Among its outputs there are the relaxation length and the dynamic forces and torque transmitted to the suspension of the vehicle. Combining the tire model with the vehicle model it is possible to perform any kind of maneuver such as overtaking, changing of lane and steering pad at growing speed with or without braking, or accelerating. Therefore the 3 D tire model {{can be seen as a}} powerful tool to optimize the tire characteristics through a sensitivity analysis performed with tire and vehicle models linked to each other without the need of building prototypes.

40|$|A key {{question}} in the development <b>of</b> a <b>tire</b> is "How can this tire improve vehicle handling?" Good handling tires contribute not only to active safety of vehicles, {{but also to the}} pleasure <b>of</b> driving. <b>Handling</b> performance is largely determined by the driver. Therefore, the final and most important <b>handling</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>tires</b> is done by professional test drivers driving on a handling circuit and giving their subjective opinion. This provides the tire manufacturer with the important tire handling performance, but it gives limited information on what the driver perceives as good and how his opinion is formed; the driver is still a 'black box'. Three methods, all based on field experiments, for gaining this knowledge about subjective assessments were chosen for this research. They have in common that they predict the driver's subjective assessment <b>of</b> <b>tire</b> <b>handling,</b> based on vehicle dynamics measurements. The differences lie in the way they derive and utilize these measurements.  For method 1, the prediction is done with a General Regression Neural Network based on vehicle dynamics measurements. With this method, several limitations for using regression for tire handling can be circumvented. Method 2 focuses on the driver's workload as an indication for his subjective assessment. This method derives {{from the fact that the}} driver adapts to changing vehicle handling behavior.  Method 3 also focuses on the driver but not by looking at measures from 'outside' the driver, like workload measures, but by modeling the driver behavior during closed-loop driver-vehicle simulations and looking at driver parameters 'inside' the driver (model).   The results show that all three methods can predict the driver's opinion about tire handling, based on vehicle dynamics measures. Analysis of the relevant measures for the prediction of methods 1 and 2, provides information on the 'what'-question. Likewise, method 3 provides information on the 'how'-question.  In addition, drivers adapting behavior, e. g., compensating for less good handling tires by investing more effort, can be quantified with the mental workload measures. This makes them good indicators <b>of</b> driver's perceived <b>tire</b> <b>handling</b> behavior, even when the performance measures do not show differences.  For implementation of one or more methods, only a subset of the vehicle dynamics measurements used for this research is needed. During use, the methods can be adapted to changing tire testing methods, with different measurements, handling aspects or maneuvers. When vehicle and tire models are available, these methods can also be used for virtual testing, predicting driver's opinion on tire handling.  This research provides a first step in opening up the 'black box' of the driver by quantifying the driver's tire feeling. ...|$|R
