The often makeshift, ad hoc nature of small <b>data</b> <b>centers</b> often results in little attention paid to energy efficiency and inadequate cooling equipment. The small physical footprint of these <b>data</b> <b>centers,</b> typically embedded within a larger building, makes it difficult to identify and target for efficiency measures. These conditions make small <b>data</b> <b>centers</b> notoriously inefficient relative to their larger counterparts. In this report, we present an analysis of small and midsize <b>data</b> <b>centers</b> in the US, drawing from surveys of commercial building stock. We find that servers in small <b>data</b> <b>centers</b> make up approximately 40 % of installed server stock, with the vast majority of sites utilizing only 1 - 2 servers. We identify industries where small <b>data</b> <b>centers</b> are most prevalent, finding that the highest saturations are in medical, retail, office, and education sectors. Small <b>data</b> <b>centers</b> typically lack dedicated cooling equipment, often relying on building air conditioning and ventilation equipment for cooling. We further find that the type of cooling equipment used is highly correlated with the number of operational server racks, with less efficient cooling options used with fewer racks. We develop geospatial maps of small and midsize <b>data</b> <b>centers</b> to visually identify regions of high server concentration and calculate associated CO 2 emissions.

5|$|The most {{frequently}} used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible–infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice <b>Data</b> <b>Center</b> (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, {{which has led to}} other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, {{it is important to have}} continuous information about the snow cover.
