5|$|Though rarely {{encountered}} {{because of}} its oceanic habitat, a handful of documented attacks on <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> apparently caused by cookiecutter sharks. Nevertheless, this diminutive shark is not regarded as highly dangerous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the cookiecutter shark under Least Concern, as it is widely distributed, has no commercial value, and is not particularly susceptible to fisheries.|$|E
5|$|A narrator {{explains}} how <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> unaware that {{a race of}} extraterrestrials was making plans to occupy Earth. Ray Ferrier is a divorced crane operator longshoreman {{who works at a}} dock in Brooklyn, New York and lives in Bayonne, New Jersey. Ray is estranged from his children. His former wife, Mary Ann, later drops off the children, 10-year-old daughter Rachel and teenage son Robbie, at Ray's house on her way to visit her parents in Boston. Unexplained changes in the weather occur, including lightning that strikes multiple times {{in the middle of an}} intersection and disrupts all electricity.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{had argued}} that {{humanity}} evolved in Africa, because this is where great apes like gorillas and chimpanzees lived. Though Darwin's claims have since been vindicated by the fossil record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like Charles Lyell, a geologist, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who had thought {{of the theory of}} evolution around the same time as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> more closely related to gibbons and orangutans, they identified Southeast Asia as the cradle of humanity because this is where these apes lived. Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.|$|E

5|$|Due to flooding, troops {{evacuated}} {{dozens of}} communities along the Gulf coast. Many desert communities {{throughout the state}} were left without any telephone or electrical service; wood, tarpaper, and cardboard were all scattered. Dozens of scores of huts were destroyed. Many <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> swept into the gulf. Sixteen people died inside {{the remains of a}} building. Moreover, the Piojillo river overflowed its banks, killing many people and resulting in considerable damage. Elsewhere, destruction was reported in San Jose del Cabo, Cabo San Lucas, San Lucas, and Puntas Arena; Pichilinague also received moderate damage. However, there are no known reports of any casualties in all four of those places. Hurricane Liza was also one of six hurricane to directly impact Los Cabos.|$|E
5|$|Flint scrapers, {{knives and}} other {{materials}} associated with neolithic <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> discovered on the moor in the late 19th and early 20th century by local antiquarians such as Charles Roeder. The Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) to Ribchester (Bremetennacum) roughly followed {{the line of the}} A56 road (Bury New Road) which is just to the east of Kersal Moor. There was a Roman camp at Rainsough just to the west, and some have speculated {{that there may have been}} a second camp to the east, in the area known as Castle Hill, making a defensive line across the moor to protect the north of Mamucium.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the last}} glacial period, Indiana's {{topography}} was dominated by spruce and pine forests and was home to mastodon, caribou, and saber-toothed cats. While Northern Indiana had been covered by glaciers, Southern Indiana remained unaltered by the ice's advance, leaving plants and animals that could sustain human communities. Indiana's earliest known inhabitants were Paleo-Indians. Evidence exists that <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> in Indiana as early as the Archaic stage (8000–6000 BC). Hunting camps of the nomadic Clovis culture have been found in Indiana. Carbon dating of artifacts found in the Wyandotte Caves of Southern Indiana shows humans mined flint there as early 2000 BC. These nomads ate quantities of freshwater mussels from local streams, as shown by their shell mounds found throughout southern Indiana.|$|E

5|$|John Hick {{published}} Evil and the God of Love in 1966, {{in which}} he developed a theodicy {{based on the work}} of Irenaeus. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, based on human development. Hick framed his theodicy as an attempt to respond to the problem of evil in light of scientific development, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, and as an alternative to the traditionally accepted Augustinian theodicy. Rejecting the idea that <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> created perfectly and then fell away from perfection, Hick instead argued that humans are still in the process of creation. He interpreted the fall of man, described in the book of Genesis, as a mythological description of the current state of humans.|$|E
5|$|New gods {{continued}} to emerge after this transformation. Some important deities like Isis and Amun {{are not known}} to have appeared until the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BC). Places and concepts could suddenly inspire {{the creation of a}} deity to represent them, and deities were sometimes created to serve as opposite-sex counterparts to established gods or goddesses. Kings were said to be divine, although only a few {{continued to}} be worshipped long after their deaths. Some non-royal <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> said to have the favor of the gods and were venerated accordingly. This veneration was usually short-lived, but the court architects Imhotep and Amenhotep son of Hapu were regarded as gods centuries after their lifetimes, as were some other officials.|$|E
5|$|Raëlians {{believe that}} {{throughout}} the ages, members of the Elohim civilization sent different prophets, including Moses, Jesus, Buddha and many others whose role was to guide humanity and to prepare humans for the future, {{all of whom were}} created {{as a result of a}} sexual union between a human woman and one of the Elohim. To Raëlians, this was possible because the Elohim had advanced DNA synthesis and genetic engineering. The Elohim later reduced the frequent visits so that <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> largely left to progress on their own, until the time of the Apocalypse/Revelation when they would send their final messenger and disclose themselves at an extraterrestrial embassy, establishing political and economic ties.|$|E

Keroro is kept busy with manual labor and constant abuse, primarily from the family daughter, Natsumi. Each member of the platoon finds himself in the care of a human: Giroro's <b>human</b> <b>is</b> Natsumi Hinata, whom he falls in love with; Keroro's <b>human</b> <b>is</b> Fuyuki Hinata, who considers the Sergeant his only true friend; Kululu's <b>human</b> <b>is</b> Mutsumi Saburo, who discovered him; Dororo's <b>human</b> <b>is</b> Koyuki, a fellow ninja; and Tamama's <b>human</b> <b>is</b> his equal in bipolar insanity, Momoka Nishizawa.

5|$|Star Trek: Enterprise {{follows the}} adventures of {{the crew of the}} {{starship}} Enterprise, designation NX-01. They are the first deep space explorers in Starfleet, using the first Warp 5 equipped vessel. At the start of the series, it is revealed that the Vulcans have withheld advanced technology from humanity since their first contact, concerned that <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> not ready for it. This has delayed human space exploration and caused resentment in Captain Jonathan Archer, whose father developed the Warp 5 engine but did not live to see it used.|$|E
5|$|The Jeopardy! staff used {{different}} {{means to}} notify Watson {{and the human}} players when to buzz, which was critical in many rounds. The <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> notified by a light, which took them tenths of a second to perceive. Watson was notified by an electronic signal and could activate the buzzer within about eight milliseconds. The humans tried {{to compensate for the}} perception delay by anticipating the light, but the variation in the anticipation time was generally too great to fall within Watson's response time. Watson did not attempt to anticipate the notification signal.|$|E
5|$|The ONA {{believe that}} there are {{historical}} precedents to their practice of human sacrifice, expressing belief in a prehistoric tradition in which <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> sacrificed to a goddess named Baphomet at the spring equinox and to the Arcturus star in the autumn. However, the ONA's advocacy of human sacrifice has drawn strong criticism from other Satanist groups like the Temple of Set, who deem it to be detrimental to their own attempts to make Satanism more socially acceptable within Western nations.|$|E

30|$|As {{outlined}} in Figure  1, <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> {{an essential part}} of the urban water cycle and water treatment aims at avoiding or minimizing the exposure of humans to OMP via drinking water. However, <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> exposed to chemicals in many ways, e.g. in their homes, at work or via food. Human biomonitoring by means of OMP measurements in urine samples provides information on the extent to which <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> exposed to chemicals. Monitoring of human urine also indicates to which extent <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> a source of OMP found in municipal wastewater. For <b>human</b> biomonitoring, it <b>is</b> essential to consider also metabolites of OMP as recently shown for trialkyl phosphates[48].|$|R
5|$|The Orcs {{enlarged}} {{the portal}} {{until they could}} transport seven warriors, who massacred a Human village. The raiding party brought back samples of good food and fine worksmanship, and a report that the <b>Humans</b> <b>were</b> defenseless. The Orcs' raiding parties grew larger and bolder, until they assaulted Azeroth's principal castle. However, the Humans had been training warriors of their own, especially the mounted, heavily armed Knights. These, assisted by Human Sorcerers, gradually forced the Orcs to retreat through the portal, which the Humans had not discovered.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{antimicrobial}} peptides against P. acnes {{is under}} investigation {{as a treatment for}} acne to overcoming antibiotic resistance. In 2007, the first genome sequencing of a P. acnes bacteriophage (PA6) was reported. The authors proposed applying this research toward development of bacteriophage therapy as an acne treatment in order to overcome the problems associated with long-term antibiotic therapy such as bacterial resistance. Oral and topical probiotics are also being evaluated as treatments for acne. Probiotics have been hypothesized to have therapeutic effects for those affected by acne due to their ability to decrease skin inflammation and improve skin moisture by increasing the skin's ceramide content. As of 2014, studies examining the effects of probiotics on acne in <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> limited.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also brought}} out, {{for the first}} time, the burial customs of the Neolithic people. Both human and animal skeletons were found in deep oval shaped pits, located either below the floors of the {{dwelling}} units or in its precincts. These pits were filled with ash, stones and potsherds. Some of the human skulls found here had trepanning (bored hole) marks. In many pits, bones of dogs and antlered deer were found along with human skeletons. The skeletons of <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> found in the burial pits in a sitting position along with bones of animals.|$|E

5|$|Until the Taung childthe 2.8 million-year-old {{remains of}} an Australopithecus africanuswere {{discovered}} in South Africa in 1924, Dubois's and Koenigswald's discoveries were the oldest hominid remains ever found. Some scientists {{of the day}} suggested that Dubois's Java Man was a potential intermediate form between modern humans and the common ancestor we share with the other great apes. This supposition has been confirmed, but the current consensus of anthropologists is that the direct ancestors of modern <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> African populations of Homo erectus (possibly Homo ergaster), rather than the Asian populations {{of the same species}} exemplified by Java Man and Peking Man.|$|E
5|$|Various {{evolutionary}} ideas {{had already}} been proposed to explain new findings in biology. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but {{during the first half}} of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England, while science was part of natural theology. Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.|$|E
5|$|Von Koenigswald {{also made}} several discoveries in Sangiran, Central Java, where more fossils of early <b>humans</b> <b>were</b> {{discovered}} between 1936 and 1941. Among the discoveries was a skullcap of similar size to that found by Dubois at the Trinil 2 site. Von Koenigswald's discoveries in Sangiran {{convinced him that}} all these skulls belonged to early humans. Dubois again refused to acknowledge the similarity. Ralph von Koenigswald and Franz Weidenreich compared the fossils from Java and Zhoukoudian and concluded that Java Man and Peking Man were closely related. Dubois died in 1940, still refusing to recognize their conclusion, and official reports remain critical of the Sangiran site's poor presentation and interpretation.|$|E
