40|$|Local {{spectral}} {{functions and}} Nuclear Magnetic Relaxation (NMR) rates, 1 /T 1, for the spin-half Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Kagome Lattice are calculated using Moriyas Gaussian approximation, {{as well as}} through an extrapolation of multiple <b>frequency</b> <b>moments.</b> The temperature dependence of the calculated rates is compared with the oxygen 1 /T 1 NMR data in Herbertsmithite. We find that the Gaussian approximation for 1 /T 1 shows behavior qualitatively similar to experiments with a sharp drop in rates at low temperatures, consistent with a spin-gapped behavior. However, this approximation significantly underestimates the magnitude of 1 /T 1 even at room temperature. Rates obtained from extrapolation of multiple <b>frequency</b> <b>moments</b> give very good agreement with the room temperature NMR data with J = 195 +/- 20 K and hyperfine couplings determined independently from other measurements.

The best space lower bound known for computing the k th <b>frequency</b> <b>moment</b> in random-order streams is Ω(n 1 - 2. 5 /k) by Andoni et al., and it is conjectured that the real lower bound shall be Ω(n 1 - 2 /k). In this paper, we resolve this conjecture. In our approach, we revisit the direct sum theorem developed by Bar-Yossef et al. in a random-partition private messages model and provide a tight Ω(n 1 - 2 /k /ℓ) space lower bound for any ℓ-pass algorithm that approximates the <b>frequency</b> <b>moment</b> in random-order stream model to a constant factor.

For example, counting the αth <b>frequency</b> <b>moment,</b> F (α) = ∑ D i= 1 At[i] α, of a streaming signal At (where t denotes time), has been an active area of research, in theoretical computer science, databases, and data mining. When α = 1, the task (i. e., counting the sum) can be accomplished using a counter. When α ̸ = 1, however, it becomes non-trivial to design a small space (i. e., low memory) counting system. Compressed Counting (CC) is proposed for efficiently computing the αth <b>frequency</b> <b>moment</b> of a data stream At, where 0 < α ≤ 2.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{model for}} the density of states (DOS) for strongly inhomogeneous and bulk fluids has been proposed based on γ distributions. The contribution to the density of states from the collective dynamics is modeled as an incomplete γ distribution and the high frequency region is obtained from {{the solution of the}} memory equation using a sech memory kernel. Using only the <b>frequency</b> <b>moments</b> as input, the model parameters for the collective dynamics are obtained by matching moments of the resulting distribution. The model results in an analytical expression for the self-diffusivity of the fluid. We present results for soft sphere fluids confined in slit-shaped pores as well as bulk soft sphere liquids. Comparisons of the DOS, velocity autocorrelation functions, and memory kernels with molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the model predicts features in the DOS over the entire frequency range and is able to capture changes in the DOS as a function of fluid density and temperature. As a result the predicted VACFs, memory kernels, and self-diffusivities are accurately predicted over a wide range of conditions. Since the <b>frequency</b> <b>moments</b> for bulk liquids can be obtained from pair correlation functions, our method provides a direct route from fluid structure to dynamics. For fluids confined in slit-shaped pores, where the <b>frequency</b> <b>moments</b> are obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, the predicted self-diffusivities capture the resulting oscillations due to variations in the solvation pressure, {{and in the case of}} smooth walled pores, the predictions are superior to those obtained using kinetic theory...|$|R
40|$|Compressed Counting (CC) was {{recently}} proposed for approximating the αth <b>frequency</b> <b>moments</b> of data streams, for 0 < α ≤ 2, especially α ≈ 1. One direct application of CC is {{to estimate the}} entropy, which is an important summary statistic in Web/network measurement and often serves a crucial“feature”for data mining. The Rényi entropy and the Tsallis entropy are functions of the αth frequency moments; and both approach the Shannon entropy as α → 1. Previous studies used the standard algorithm based on symmetric stable random projections to approximate the αth <b>frequency</b> <b>moments</b> and the entropy. Based on maximally-skewed stable random projections, Compressed Counting (CC) dramatically improves symmetric stable random projections, especially when α ≈ 1.

When estimating the <b>frequency</b> <b>moments,</b> the Rényi entropy, and the Tsallis entropy, the improvements of CC, in terms of accuracy, appear to approach “infinity ” as α → 1. When estimating Shannon entropy using Rényi entropy or Tsallis entropy, the improvements of CC, in terms of accuracy, are roughly 20 - to 50 -fold. When estimating the Shannon entropy from Rényi entropy, {{in order to achieve}} the same accuracy, CC only needs about 1 / 50 of the samples (storage space), compared to symmetric stable random projections.
