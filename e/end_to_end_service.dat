40|$|We propose {{extending}} the service interface of IP {{with the ability}} to carry small payments from the sender to the receiver and to ISPs on the path. This allows an endpoint to purchase improved <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>service</b> for the packets it sends and receives. These payments are a new source of revenue for ISPs and content providers. We argue that the fine grained control and the additional revenue streams enabled by our proposal may provide a solution to the network neutrality debate without either stifling ISP growth or unfairly taxing content providers. To support this extension of network functionality, we propose a multi-ISP accounting framework which is efficient, convenient, and requires only limited trust. The accounting header for data packets is typically no larger than 20 bytes and data plane processing is not more complex than today â€“ no authentication or cryptography are needed. All actual payments are large and happen between neighbors who already have contracts. A scalable accounting system owned and operated by ISPs provides audit trails that expose cheating attempts.

However, {{the possibility of the}} licensed user reclaiming the channel raises additional concerns on how best to reserve resources for secondary users (SUs) that are likely to have different qualities of service (QoSs) depending on their application requirements. This paper addresses the problem of spectrum resource management for co-located SUs with both streaming and intermittent data by efficiently identifying the number of backup channels that will ensure seamless <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>service.</b> The contributions of this paper are threefold: First, a comprehensive analytical framework based on queueing theory is devised to calculate the theoretical delay in accessing the spectrum depending on the required QoS, with guidelines on how to optimize the set of back-up channels for possible future use; second, a method of spectrum allocation for SUs with these different QoS demands is formulated, especially as they co-exist and affect the performance of each other; third, a case study of applying these techniques in a novel application area of wireless medical telemetry is presented. Results reveal that the simulated spectral efficiency of the channel allocation using our approach matches closely with our theoretical predictions, within a 5 % bound.

40|$|Fueled by {{the growing}} {{acceptance}} of the Web Services Architecture, an emerging trend in application service delivery is {{to move away from}} tightly coupled systems towards structures of loosely coupled, dynamically bound systems to support both long and short business relationships. It appears highly likely that the next generation of e-Business systems will consist of an interconnection of services, each provided by a possibly different service provider, that are put together on an "on demand" basis to offer an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>service</b> to a customer. Such an environment, which we call Dynamic e-Business (DeB), will be administered and managed according to dynamically negotiated Service Level Agreements (SLA) between service providers and customers. Consequently, system administration will increasingly become SLA-driven and needs to address challenges such as dynamically determining whether enough spare capacity is available to accomodate additional SLAs, the negotiation of SLA terms and conditions, the continuous monitoring of a multitude of agreed-upon SLA parameters and the troubleshooting of systems, based on their importance for achieving business objectives. A key prerequisite for meeting these goals is to understand the relationship between the cost of the systems an administrator is responsible for and the revenue they are able to generate, i. e., a model needs to be in place to express system resources in financial terms.

40|$|In IEEE 802. 16 Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) routing, delay aware load {{balancing}} {{can be achieved}} by selecting the shortest path with low latency and network load. But network load and latency together are not considered in most of the existing routing metrics. Here, we propose a delay aware load balanced routing protocol for wireless mesh networks by designing a combined route metric. Initially, we calculate the metric of traffic interference (TIM) which considers the traffic load of interfering neighbors. Next, we calculate the metric for <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>service</b> delay (EDM) by using the expected time spent in transmitting all packets waiting for transmission through a link. This metric can be used to select the path with the lowest end-to-end service delay in terms of current network load. Using these two metrics we define a combined route metric for efficient route selection. A route discovery mechanism is proposed which broadcasts request packets along with expected link delay and load value. The suitable path is selected based upon the least routing metric value. A route maintenance mechanism is also proposed to maintain the stability of the network. Using this, frequent changes in the path can be avoided and transmission efficiency is increased. By simulation results, we show that the proposed protocol reduces the delay and overhead there by increasing the overall packet delivery ratio, when compared with existing protocols...|$|E

40|$|Internet Service Providers {{compete for}} {{customers}} while exchanging traffic flows {{to provide a}} complete, <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end,</b> <b>service</b> to final users. This requires reliable interconnections among competitors that form multiple Global Supply Chain Networks (GSCNs) for the delivery and exchange of Internet traffic. Interconnection decisions form {{the architecture of the}} Internet supply chain as they design {{the rules of the game}} played by the operators, in terms of reciprocal access pricing and quality and modalities of traffic exchanged. From a provider's point of view, the strategic assessment of its direct interconnection environment is crucial in defining the competitive and complementary elements of its extended GSCN. This paper focuses on the relationship between a provider's connectivity and the degree of mutual connectivity among the operators this provider is connected to. The strategic relevance of this relationship is clearly explained as follows: thebetter connected a provider is, the easier it is to deliver its traffic with high Quality of Service and low costs, while the less interconnected among themselves a provider's neighbours are, the easier it is, for the provider, to exert its bargaining power over them. This bargaining power, of a wellconnected provider over its poorly connected network - neighbours, shows when contracting over quality standards, access pricing and interconnection terms. This paper estimates two separate econometric models showing that the connectivity features of the GSCN display significant differences in network hierarchy and complexity depending on whether they are observed from a European, North American or Rest of the World observation point...|$|E

Providers compete both {{for business and}} final customers, while cooperating the exchanges of information flows composing the digital commodities, to provide a complete, <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end,</b> <b>service</b> to final users. A myriad of interconnection decisions form the connectivity's architecture of this Global Supply Chain Network, designing {{the rules of the}} business game played by the operators. This paper, using a dataset of interconnection protocols over 195 Internet Exchange Points across the World, focuses on the relationship between a provider's connectivity and clustering: the mutual connectivity among the operators this provider is connected to. The strategic relevance of this relationship between connectivity and clustering is clear: the better connected a provider is, the easier it is to deliver the digital commodities with high quality and low costs and, when the neighbours of a provider are less interconnected among themselves, it is easier, for the provider, to exert its bargaining power over them. We estimate an econometric model finding that the continental location of an Internet Exchange Point has a significant effect on the sign of the elasticity between clustering and connectivity. This indicates that Local Supply Chain Networks display significant differences in their clusters of integration, hierarchical organization and complexity, depending on whether they are based in Europe, North America or Rest of the World...|$|E

40|$|The word 'competition' in {{economic}} terminology means {{the independence of}} business actions opted by different sellers of the same product. However, in context of the telecom industry, the same word has opposite connotationâ€”interdependence among competing service providers. The reason is that "the telecom system must work as a single system [because] users desire <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>services</b> within an apparently 'seamless' communication network. They want connectedness and connectability" [Melody (1997), p. 53]. Therefore, to attract users, a new entrant in the industry, while intending {{to compete with the}} incumbent monopoly operator, has to ensure interconnection arrangements with the latter. Another unique characteristic of this industry in a competitive set-up is that, initially, a new entrant always has a weaker bargaining position for an interconnection agreement with the incumbent operator. It is so because, in the first place, it is expensive and also inadvisable for the new entrant to build a parallel infrastructure up front. To test the market, the entrant may better pay for access privileges to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and rent trunk lines from the incumbent Public Telecommunication Operator (PTO). Even if the new entrant builds a parallel infrastructure before he starts the service, he still has to go to the incumbent for interconnection privileges to attract subscribers for its service. If the incumbent operator simply denies interconnection, then most of the potential subscribers will most likely choose the incumbent operator, because they want to have access to more people on telephone. ...|$|R
