5|$|The {{standard}} model for an {{active galactic nucleus}} is based upon an accretion disc that forms around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the core region of the galaxy. The radiation from an active galactic nucleus results from the gravitational energy of matter as it falls toward the black hole from the disc. In about 10% of these galaxies, a <b>diametrically</b> <b>opposed</b> pair of energetic jets ejects particles from the galaxy core at velocities close to the speed of light. The mechanism for producing these jets is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|The {{integration}} process repeatedly brought Indian and Pakistani leaders into conflict. During negotiations, Jinnah, representing the Muslim League, strongly supported {{the right of}} the princely states to remain independent, joining neither India nor Pakistan, an attitude which was <b>diametrically</b> <b>opposed</b> to the stance taken by Nehru and the Congress and which was reflected in Pakistan's support of Hyderabad's bid to stay independent. Post-partition, the Government of Pakistan accused India of hypocrisy on the ground that there was little difference between the accession of the ruler of Junagadh to Pakistan—which India refused to recognise—and the accession of the Maharajah of Kashmir to India, and for several years refused to recognise the legality of India's incorporation of Junagadh, treating it as de jure Pakistani territory.|$|E

5|$|Rocksteady {{intended}} for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three different playing experiences. Other villains from Batman's comic history {{were selected to}} show that the prison was a melting pot of people from Gotham. The developers believed that providing a small part of each villain's story rather than focusing on a select few allowed the player to meet many more characters and effectively conveyed the feeling of being in a superprison filled with supervillains. Rocksteady decided early on that the Joker would die in the story, and developed the idea of him poisoning Batman with the same affliction, in order to show how the two <b>diametrically</b> <b>opposed</b> characters would interact in pursuit of a shared goal. Warner Bros. and Dini did not oppose killing off the character {{as long as it was}} not done for shock value, and as long as they made it clear that Batman was not at fault, since he would not intentionally kill someone.|$|E
5|$|Although Metzger {{had been}} trying to pitch a movie based on the life of Joseph Süß Oppenheimer for many years, the impetus for the movie came from Joseph Goebbels' desire to make an antisemitic {{response}} to Mendes' philo-semitic film adaptation of Lion Feuchtwanger's 1925 novel Jud Süß. Because Mendes' movie was so sympathetic to the subject, the scriptwriters shifted their model to Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. However, even after Harlan rewrote the original script, the result was not antisemitic enough to suit Goebbels' propaganda needs so he personally intervened in the editing process to the point of dropping some scenes and rewriting others including making a substantial change to the film's ending to show Süß as humbled rather than defiant. Thus, the message of the film was <b>diametrically</b> <b>opposed</b> to the intent of Feuchtwanger's novel. At the same time, however, the film evokes Feuchtwanger’s texts, twisting and reversing the core of the Jewish writer’s work. Although inspired by the historical details of Süß's life, the novel, novella, and film only loosely correspond to the historical sources available at the Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg.|$|E

On December 12, 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations recognised the Republic of Korea as the sole legal government of Korea.|$|E
50|$|Formation and {{powering}} of astrophysical jets is {{not fully}} understood, but {{it is likely that}} they arise from dynamic interactions within accretion disks or from active processes associated with compact central objects such as black holes, neutron stars or pulsars. One possible explanation is that tangled magnetic fields aim two <b>diametrically</b> <b>opposing</b> beams away from the central source by angles only several degrees wide. (c.>1%.). According to another hypothesis, the jets are due to an effect in general relativity known as frame-dragging.|$|R

In this paper we will investigate the elaboration of plans for Russian territorial {{expansion in the}} New World, noting that these plans often were an organic part of larger plans to include the whole North Pacific among the possessions of the Russian Empire...|$|R
50|$|The central {{thesis of}} “Breaking the Tablets” {{is that the}} history of the Jews is “bookmarked” by two <b>diametrically</b> <b>opposing</b> “revelations”: Sinai and Auschwitz. The revelation on Mount Sinai was the apex of God’s {{nearness}} to the Jews, while the revelation at Auschwitz was the nadir of God’s absence from them. Halivni’s conviction is that Auschwitz represents not merely God’s “hiding his face” from Israel, {{as a consequence of the}} Jews’ sins — a familiar trope in rabbinic theology — but also his actual, ontological withdrawal from human history.|$|R
40|$|AbstractNitric oxide (NO) {{participates in}} a {{diverse array of}} {{biological}} functions in mammalian organ systems. Depending on the biochemical environment, the production of NO may result in cytoprotection or cytotoxicity. The paradoxical actions of NO arise from the complexities generated by the redox milieu, NO concentration/bioavailability, and tissue/cell context, which ultimately result in {{the wide range of}} regulatory roles observed. Additionally, in physiological versus pathological states, NO often displays <b>diametrically</b> <b>opposing</b> affects in several organ systems. Here, we will discuss the roles of NO during reproduction, organ system development, in particular, the cardiovascular system, and its potential implications in diabetes-induced fetal defects...|$|R

The sexual process and sexual differentiation are different phenomena, and, in essence, are <b>diametrically</b> <b>opposed.</b> The first creates (increases) diversity of genotypes, and the second decreases it by half.|$|E

Amleth's madness was certainly altogether feigned; he prepared his vengeance a year beforehand, and carried it out deliberately and ruthlessly at every point. His riddling speech has little more than an outward similarity to the words of Hamlet, who resembles him, however, in his disconcerting penetration into his enemies' plans.|$|E

We propose a dynamic equilibrium agency model to resolve these standing issues. Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that the indeterminate relation between pay-to-performance-sensitivity and total risk {{is due to the}} <b>diametrically</b> <b>opposing</b> effects of firm-specific risk and systematic risk on pay-to-performance-sensitivity, and the increases in executive compensation and firm size are mainly driven by a steadily growing economy...|$|R

25|$|According to Talbot and Eaton, a revisionist {{interpretation}} of Prataparudra II himself appeared much sooner, {{within a few}} years of his death, and for broadly similar reasons. A stone inscription dated 1330 mentions a Prolaya Nayaka, who was said to have restored order, as in Prataparudra days. He presented himself as a legitimate successor to Prataparudra, by portraying both of them as righteous monarchs, meanwhile reconstructing Prataparudra's life and career in a favorable way. By 1420, Muslim rulers had become accommodated to the Deccan society, and strong dichotomies between Hindus and Muslims were no longer useful. Muslim rulers were no longer conceived as <b>diametrically</b> <b>opposed</b> to the figure of Prataparudra, but rather as rulers of equal status.|$|E

His ideological opponents often cite his strong nationalist feelings (attempting rehabilitation of Serb-nationalist Chetniks) as contrarian to his insistence on peaceful solution to Yugoslav crisis.
