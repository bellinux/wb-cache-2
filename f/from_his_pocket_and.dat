5|$|The {{woman is}} perched against an armoire, the man {{approaches}} and covers her naked {{body with the}} yellow bathrobe, and the two move towards the window. After they step out on the balcony, the man draws a toothpick <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> hands it to her with an upwards nod, which she reciprocates. After looking out for another few seconds she clasps his neck lightly and they step back inside.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{comes to}} the end of the {{transcript}} and Sally realises Larry has stopped writing it due to the presence of an Angel in the room. The Doctor, surmising their fate, warns them not even to blink around the Angels. Sally and Larry make their way to the basement of the house and discover more Angels guarding the TARDIS. The Angels attack and Sally and Larry use the Yale key to hide inside the TARDIS. The Angels surround and rock the TARDIS to try to gain entry. Once in the control room, a hologram of the Doctor informs them that they have a control disk with them. Larry takes a now-glowing DVD <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> inserts it into the console. The TARDIS' engines engage and the ship dematerialises, leaving a panicking Sally and Larry behind. With the TARDIS gone, the Angels who were all stood around the TARDIS have been tricked into looking at each other and have become permanently frozen as statues.|$|E
5|$|Diana {{discovers that}} Paul {{has written a}} story about her in his {{newspaper}} and she confronts him. Diana tells him that she {{will have a lot}} of job offers in New York, but Paul says that no one will be interested as she is toxic. Diana's plane ticket is cancelled and she is thrown out of the hotel by Paul. She asks Declan for help and he tells her that Paul keeps his business papers in the home safe. Diana kisses Paul, {{and at the same time}} she takes his house keys <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> she breaks into his house. Diana does not find anything and, in anger, she smashes Paul's possessions. Diana calls a mystery person and arranges for them to hurt Paul. She then goes to Rebecca and tells her about her husband's affair. Someone goes to the Lassiter's mezzanine and pushes Paul from it. Detective Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) discovers one of Diana's earrings at the scene and he stops her at the airport. During questioning, Diana tells him to speak to Rebecca again after revealing her affair with Paul. Andrew, Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) and Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) follow Diana and see her meeting with Jack Ward (Peter Lowrey), a hitman she called on the night Paul was pushed. Natasha retrieves Jack's phone and the group listen to a message left by Diana, telling him to leave town. Andrew confronts Diana at her hotel and Mark arrives to arrest her for conspiracy to commit murder. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) receives some emails telling her that Diana did not push Paul and she goes to see her.

500|$|He {{commanded}} the company's 1st Battery at Fleurbaix, Messines {{and on the}} Somme until 5 August, when he was wounded in a duel with a German officer at Pozières. He and a German officer—who was leading an attack against Cherry's position—were exchanging shots from neighbouring shell-holes. Eventually, they both rose, firing simultaneously. The German officer hit Cherry in the neck but was mortally wounded by Cherry in return. Cherry approached the dying man, who pulled a package of letters <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> asked Cherry to have them censored and posted. Cherry promised {{to do so and}} the German handed over the letters, with the words; [...] "And so it ends". He died shortly afterwards. As a result of his wounds, Cherry was evacuated to England for treatment.|$|E
500|$|The {{impression}} of Kruger garnered by the British envoys in Pretoria during early 1877 {{was one of}} an unspeakably vulgar, bigoted backveld peasant. Regarding his austere, weather-beaten face, greying hair and simple Dopper dress of a short-cut black jacket, baggy trousers and a black top hat, they considered him extremely ugly. Furthermore, they found his personal habits, such as copious spitting, revolting. Shepstone's legal adviser William Morcom {{was one of the}} first British officials to write about Kruger: calling him [...] "gigantically horrible", he recounted a public luncheon at which Kruger dined with a dirty pipe protruding <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> such greasy hair that he spent part of the meal combing it. According to Martin Meredith, Kruger's unsightliness was mentioned in British reports [...] "so often that it became shorthand for his whole personality, and indeed, his objectives". They did not consider him a major threat to British ambitions.|$|E
500|$|Officer Lang {{observed}} that Drayton and Brown were wearing [...] "heavy jackets and baggy pants", despite warm weather that day. Lang suspected Brown and Drayton {{might have been}} using their baggy clothing to conceal weapons or drugs, so he asked Brown, [...] "o you mind if I check your person?" [...] Brown responded, [...] "ure", leaned up in his seat, removed a cellular phone <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> opened his jacket. Lang patted down the outside of his clothing and felt small packages [...] "similar to drug packages detected on other occasions". Officer Lang then arrested Brown, handcuffed him, and Officer Hoover walked him off the bus. Lang then asked Drayton, [...] "ind if I check you?", to which Drayton responded [...] "by lifting his hands about eight inches from his legs". Lang detected similar objects during a pat down of Drayton's legs, placed him under arrest, and escorted him off the bus. A further search determined that Brown had duct-taped three bundles containing 483 grams of cocaine between several layers of boxer shorts, and Drayton had duct-taped two bundles between several layers of boxer shorts containing 295 grams of cocaine.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the third}} day of the First Test, {{television}} footage showed England captain Mike Atherton apparently removing some substance <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> rubbing it onto the ball, which could be construed as ball tampering.

2500|$|... "Elbert Hubbard and {{the writer}} {{sat at the}} small table in The Pennsylvania Society rehashing mutual old time {{experiences}} in the west, particularly, relating tales. He had himself been adopted into the Sioux tribe, but recently. Memory may be slightly at fault, but as now recalled, {{there were a couple}} of champagne glasses, partly full, on the same table. The letter from Felix, apologizing for the delay (of repaying a $30 loan) and explaining how he had made a trip to Rapid City and found the letter which had lain in the post office for months, how he had corrected the address, got it on its way to discharge his obligation, this letter had just come in the afternoon mail. The writer drew it <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> handed it to Hubbard to read. When he had completed the reading, and asked a few pertinent questions about the author, he folded it and deliberately placed it in his own pocket, saying it would be the subject of a new A Message to Garcia which he was going to write. Before he had accomplished this planned project for the thrill and edification of his world-wide fraternity of readers, the RMS Lusitania took America's greatest modern writer and philosopher to the bottom of the sea on May 17, 1915." ...|$|E
