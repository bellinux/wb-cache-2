25|$|Emissions are {{inherent}} to the combustion of diesel fuels that are {{regulated by the}} U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.). As these emissions are a byproduct of the combustion process, {{in order to ensure}} E.P.A. compliance a fuel system must be capable of controlling the combustion of fuels as well as the mitigation of emissions. There are a number of new technologies being phased in to control the production of diesel emissions. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> system, E.G.R., and the diesel particulate filter, D.P.F., are both designed to mitigate the production of harmful emissions.|$|E
25|$|While {{studying}} {{the effect of}} biodiesel on a D.P.F. {{it was found that}} though the presence of sodium and potassium carbonates aided in the catalytic conversion of ash, as the diesel particulates are catalyzed, they may congregate inside the D.P.F. and so interfere with the clearances of the filter. This may cause the filter to clog and interfere with the regeneration process. In a study on the impact of E.G.R. rates with blends of jathropa biodiesel it was shown that there was a decrease in fuel efficiency and torque output due to the use of biodiesel on a diesel engine designed with an E.G.R. system. It was found that CO and CO2 emissions increased with an increase in <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> but NOx levels decreased. The opacity level of the jathropa blends was in an acceptable range, where traditional diesel was out of acceptable standards. It was shown that a decrease in Nox emissions could be obtained with an E.G.R. system. This study showed an advantage over traditional diesel within a certain operating range of the E.G.R. system.|$|E

Moreover, a lower fresh charge temperature in case of cooling the recycled gases provides the increase of oxygen mass fraction in the head-end space, and, consequently, it allows boosting the fuel combustion which leads to a more intensive heat generation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation performed upon a single-ended self-recuperative radiant tube burner fuelled by natural gas in the non-premixed mode, which is used in the steel industry for surface treatment. The main goal of the research activity was a systematic investigation of the burner aimed to find the best operating conditions in terms of optimum equivalence ratio, thermal power and lower pollutant emissions. The analysis, which focused on the main parameters influencing the thermal efficiency and pollutant emissions at the exhaust (NOx and CO), has been carried out for different operating conditions of the burner: input thermal powers from 12. 8 up to 18 kW and equivalence ratio from 0. 5 (very lean flame) to 0. 95 (quasi-stoichiometric condition). To significantly reduce pollutant emissions ensuring {{at the same time the}} thermal requirements of the heating process, it has been developed a new burner configuration, in which a fraction of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> recirculates in the main combustion region through a variable gap between the burner efflux and the inner flame tube. This internal <b>recirculation</b> mechanism (<b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> <b>recirculation,</b> EGR) has been favoured through the addition of a pre-combustion chamber terminated by a converging nozzle acting as a mixing/ejector to promote <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> entrainment into the flame tube.

40|$|An {{industrial}} burner {{operating in}} the MILD combustion regime through internal <b>recirculation</b> of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> has been characterized numerically. To develop a self-sufficient numerical model of the burner, two subroutines are coupled to the CFD solver to model the air preheater section and heat losses from the burner through radiation. The resulting model is validated against experimental data on species concentration and temperature. A 3 -dimensional CFD model of the burner is compared to an axisymmetric model, which allows considerable computational saving, but neglects some important burner features such {{as the presence of}} recirculation windows. Errors associated with the axisymmetric model are evaluated and discussed, as well as possible simplified procedures for engineering purposes. Modifications of the burner geometry are investigated numerically and suggested in order to enhance its performances. Such modifications are aimed at improving <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> <b>recirculation</b> which is driven by the inlet air jet momentum. The burner is found to produce only 30 ppmv of NO when operating in MILD combustion mode. For the same air preheating the NO emissions would be of approximately 1000 ppmv in flame combustion mode. It is also shown that the burner ensures more homogeneous temperature distribution in the outer surfaces with respect to flame operation, and this is attractive for burners used in furnaces devoted to materials' thermal treatment processes. The effect of air excess on the combustion regime is also discussed...|$|R
25|$|Although the 200Tdi engine {{had been}} an undoubted {{technological}} and sales success, it had certain limitations and flaws {{that needed to be}} rectified. Despite the numerous differences, it was still in essence a direct-injection version of the older Diesel Turbo engine. It was also considered rather raucous and unrefined, especially for use in the Discovery and Range Rover models. A special version of the engine had to be produced to fit the Defender, and problems with weak head gasket had been identified. The British Army (and some other military buyers) had not opted for the 200Tdi because it could not be fitted with a 24-volt generator for powering radio equipment- instead the Army continued to buy vehicles with 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesels. Upcoming European diesel emissions regulations (Euro I) meant that Land Rover would be forced to radically alter the engine anyway. The resulting development project (coded Romulus) produced the 300Tdi engine. Although externally very similar to the Discovery/Range Rover version of its predecessor, 208 changes were made. These included modifications to the block, cylinder head, fuel injector system and ancillary systems. The crankshaft, pistons and connecting rods were significantly altered over the 200Tdi. The most obvious external changes were the fitting of a rubber acoustic cover over the engine to reduce noise and the change to a single serpentine belt to drive the ancillaries instead of the multiple V-belts of the older engines. Emissions regulation included the fitting of an <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> system. Power and torque outputs remained the same, and the engine had been specifically designed to be compatible with all the models in the Land Rover range without any changes. This meant that the Defender engines were fitted in the same tune as the Discovery/Range Rover engines. The 300Tdi was noticeably smoother and quieter than the 200Tdi, but was generally found to not be quite as economical in real-world use. It turned out that the Euro I emissions regulations were not as severe as Land Rover anticipated, and so the 300Tdi was able to remain in production until the introduction of the Euro III rules. When fitted to vehicles with an automatic transmission, power was increased to 122 horsepower {{to make up for the}} power losses in the transmission. These engines (designated 23L) had Bosch Electronic Diesel Control systems, where the mechanical injector system was controlled by a drive-by-wire electronic throttle to reduce emissions. The 300Tdi was replaced in 1998 by the 5-cylinder Td5, bringing to an end the line of Land Rover 4-cylinder engines that can be traced back to 1957. The Td5 engine was loosely based on the Rover Group's L-series diesel engine. The 300Tdi remained in production in Brazil, and was offered as an option on rest of world (non-UK/Europe) models. Following Ford's acquisition of Land Rover in 2000, the engine was used in Brazilian-built Ford pick-up trucks as well. Increasing emissions laws worldwide and falling sales led to production of the 300Tdi ending in 2006. A much-modified 2.8-litre version was built by International Engines in Brazil until 2010, and was available as an after-market fitment to Land Rovers through specialist converters. International then became MWM International Motores and a further update of the 300Tdi design was launched as the 3.0 Power Stroke. Although based around the same block and basic architecture as the 300Tdi the Power Stroke has major differences such as electronic common rail injection and new crossflow cylinder head with Overhead camshaft.|$|E

A palm oil mill plant situated in Kulai, Johor {{was chosen as the}} study site. The mill was equipped with a multi-cyclones connected with a recirculation duct from the outlet to the inlet of the unit. Different recirculation airflow rates (0 %, 11 % and 17 % of the total <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate) were available by the means of external induced draft (ID) fan to extract part of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> stream from the multi-cyclones outlet back into its inlet. The flue gas volumetric flow rate and particulate concentration were measured at the boiler outlet (cyclone inlet), stack gas (emitting the cyclone) and recirculation duct using US EPA methods. The average concentration of O 2 measured was 16. 9 % while the average concentration (corrected to 7 % O 2) of CO 2, CO, NO and SO 2 measured was 2. 93 %, 5153 mg/Nm 3, 84. 2 mg/Nm 3 and 339 mg/Nm 3, respectively. Besides, the particulate emission factor based on 27, 000 kg/hr fresh fruit bunch (FFB) processed, 6, 000 kg/hr fibre and shell (F and S) burned, and 8, 000 kg/hr boiler capacity (BC) was 5. 45 Â± 2. 18 g/kg, 24. 5 Â± 9. 82 g/kg, and 18. 4 Â± 7. 36 g/kg, respectively. From the result, with the increase of inlet particulate loading, the performance of the multi-cyclones was able to achieve 74 % collection efficiency at 11 % recirculation rate, with an increment of 6 % compared to without recirculation (68 %). The performance, however, dropped to 67 % at 17 % recirculation rate because the recirculated particulates were broken up into smaller size fraction at higher recirculation rate when passing through external ID fan.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the field}} of fossil-fuel based technologies, natural gas {{combined}} cycle (NGCC) power plants are currently the best option for electricity generation, having an efficiency close to 60 %. However, they produce significant CO 2 emissions, amounting to around 0. 4 tonne/MWh for new installations. Among the carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies, the process based on chemical absorption is a well-established technology, but markedly reduces the NGCC performances. On the other side, the integration of molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) is recognized as an attractive option to overcome the main drawbacks of traditional CCS technologies. If the cathode side is fed by NGCC <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases,</b> the MCFC operates as a CO 2 concentrator, beside providing an additional generating capacity. In this paper the integration of MCFC into a two pressure levels combined cycle is investigated through an energy analysis.

2500|$|The Moke {{was built}} in Australia from 1966 to 1981 where it was {{originally}} marketed as the Morris Mini Moke and from 1973 as the Leyland Moke. Initially Australian Mokes had the same 10-inch wheels as British Mokes and Mini saloons but in 1968 these were replaced by 13-inch wheels with longer rear trailing arms, which made them more practical for gentle off-road or beach use than the British version.

40|$|International audienceExhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> (EGR) is an {{effective}} method to lower peak flame temperatures and reduce pollutant emissions. It has been widely applied in industrial applications, such as high EGR diesel combustion and high temperature air combustion (flameless combustion). Introduction of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> into a combustion system may result in variations in some flame properties. One of these variations is that the addition of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> may cause the transition of a diffusion flame from attached to lifted, i. e. flame liftoff. Understanding the mechanism of the liftoff due {{to the introduction of}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> is of great help for the further development and improvement of combustion technology employing EGR. Many studies have been devoted to attached or lifted diffusion flames. Generally the introduction of an additive to the oxidant or fuel stream of a diffusion flame causes variation in flame liftoff and other properties due to the change in combustion intensity. This change in combustion intensity is caused by five possible mechanisms. The first one is the dilution effect resulted from the decrease in the concentration of oxygen or fuel. The second one is the thermal effect caused by the change in specific heat. Thirdly, some components of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> may participate in chemical reactions and thus cause flame liftoff. This factor is referred to as chemical effect. In addition, some components of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> may alter flame temperature and cause liftoff by modifying radiation heat transfer rate. This effect is known as radiation effect. The last one is the transport property effect which is due to the difference in transport properties between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> and fuel or oxidant. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrogen (N 2) are two primary components of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases.</b> Most previous studies have attributed the impacts of CO 2 and N 2 addition on the extinction or liftoff of a diffusion flame to thermal and dilution effects [3]. While this is true for N 2 addition, it may not be correct for CO 2 addition. Our previous study [4, 5] showed that the addition of CO 2 affects some flame properties due to not only thermal and dilution effects, but also chemical effect. Besides, CO 2 addition may also modify a flame through radiation effect. Few studies have been reported on the relative importance of the five possible mechanisms on the liftoff of a diffusion flame, when CO 2 or N 2 is added...|$|R

2500|$|The {{shape of}} the Wankel {{combustion}} chamber is more resistant to preignition operating on lower-octane rating gasoline than a comparable piston engine. The combustion chamber shape may also lead to relatively incomplete combustion of the air-fuel charge. This {{would result in a}} larger amount of unburned hydrocarbons released into the exhaust. The exhaust is, however, relatively low in NOx emissions, because combustion temperatures are lower than in other engines, and also because of some inherent <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> (EGR) in early engines. Sir Harry Ricardo showed in the 1920s that for every 1% increase in the proportion of exhaust gas in the admission mix, there is a 7Â°C reduction in flame temperature. This allowed Mazda to meet the United States Clean Air Act of 1970 in 1973, with a simple and inexpensive [...] "thermal reactor", which was an enlarged chamber in the exhaust manifold. By decreasing the air-fuel ratio, unburned hydrocarbons (HC) in the exhaust would support combustion in the thermal reactor. Piston-engine cars required expensive catalytic converters to deal with both unburned hydrocarbons and NOx emissions. This inexpensive solution increased fuel consumption, which was already a weak point for the Wankel engine, and the oil crisis of 1973 raised the price of gasoline. Toyota discovered that injection of air into the exhaust port zone improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. The best results were obtained with holes in the side plates; doing it in the exhaust duct had no noticeable influence. The use of a three-stage catalysts, with air supplied in the middle, as for two-stroke piston engines, also proved beneficial.|$|E
