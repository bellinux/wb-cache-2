50|$|Grenade, Hand, Fragmentation, Mk 2A1: TNT or EC powder filler, uses M6 or M204 series {{detonating fuse}} or M10/M11 series <b>igniting</b> <b>fuse.</b> Has no baseplug {{because it was}} filled through the fuse well.|$|E
5000|$|Grenade, Hand, Practice, Mk 2: Black powder [...] "spotting" [...] {{charge in}} a {{cardboard}} tube connected to a M10 series <b>igniting</b> <b>fuse.</b> Has a standard body with a wooden or cork baseplug that popped out during detonation, creating a loud report and smoke to indicate ignition. The body could be reused and reloaded {{as long as it}} remained intact.|$|E
5000|$|Kaisariani Monastery's {{library was}} renowned and most {{probably}} owned documents from antiquity's libraries. According to the demogerontes (the council of elders) of the time, [...] "the manuscripts {{were sold to}} the English as membranes whereas {{the rest of the}} documents were used in the metropolis` kitchens." [...] During the Turkish siege of Athens, the manuscripts were transported to the Acropolis and were used to <b>ignite</b> <b>fuses.</b>|$|R
25|$|The F-4’s missile {{armament}} {{consisted of}} the AIM-7 Sparrow and the AIM-9 Sidewinder. Although the short-range AIM-9 {{was thought to be}} an effective weapon, the use of the beyond visual range AIM-7 was constrained by Rules of Engagement which in most cases required visual confirmation of a target before firing – essentially defeating any advantage that the missile would have conferred to the American pilots. Both missiles had exhibited reliability problems in 1966 combat, exacerbated by maintenance problems caused by the tropical conditions of Southeast Asia, with the majority failing to <b>ignite,</b> <b>fuse,</b> or guide to the target.|$|R

5000|$|Grenade, Hand, Practice, M21: Black powder [...] "spotting" [...] charge, uses M10 series <b>igniting</b> <b>fuse.</b> Has {{a heavier}} body and no baseplug. Its body was {{embossed}} with the vertical letters [...] "R" [...] "D" [...] and [...] "X" [...] on the knobs {{in a column}} on one side (because it was originally designed to be for an HE grenade with a more powerful RDX filler). When detonated, it made a loud report and smoke {{came out of the}} fuse vents.|$|E
5000|$|The Mk 2 {{used the}} M5, M6, M10, M11, or M204 series fuses. The early M5, and the later M6 and M204 series detonating fuses, were used on high explosive-filled grenades. The M10 and M11 series igniting fuses were used on low explosive-filled ones. The early fuses had many problems. In the M5, {{moisture}} {{could get in}} under the foil fuse cap, causing the weapon to fail to detonate. The early fuses were not completely silent and made a loud [...] "bang" [...] and produced sparks when activated. They also made a faint [...] "hissing" [...] sound while burning, potentially alerting the enemy of their presence. The M10, used during the interwar period, and the M10A1, used early in WWII, sometimes prematurely detonated when the flash from the primer hit the explosive charge rather than the delay fuse. They were replaced by the M10A2 and M10A3. A less common type of <b>igniting</b> <b>fuse</b> was the M11.|$|E
2500|$|The No 6 was a {{concussion}} grenade. A variant of it called the [...] "No 7" [...] contained shrapnel, {{making it a}} primitive fragmentation grenade. Pulling a loop {{at the top of}} the grenade <b>ignited</b> the <b>fuse.</b> Once the loop was pulled, the grenade was armed and had to be thrown immediately.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the soldier}} throws the grenade, the safety lever releases, the striker throws the safety lever {{away from the}} grenade body as it rotates to {{detonate}} the primer. The primer explodes and <b>ignites</b> the <b>fuse</b> (sometimes called the delay element). The fuse burns down to the detonator, which explodes the main charge.|$|R
5000|$|The No 6 was a {{concussion}} grenade. A variant of it called the [...] "No 7" [...] contained shrapnel, {{making it a}} primitive fragmentation grenade.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} devices {{which could}} conceivably {{be referred to}} as grenade launchers were slings, which could be used to throw early grenado fuse bombs. The ancestors of modern ballistic grenade launchers, however, were simplistic muzzle-loading devices using a stake-like body to mount a short, large-bore gun barrel into which an explosive or incendiary device could be inserted; these were later refined into shoulder-fired blunderbuss-like firearms referred to as [...] "hand mortars". These weapons were not highly regarded due to their unreliability, requiring the user to <b>ignite</b> a <b>fuse</b> on the projectile before firing and with a substantial risk of the explosive failing to leave the barrel; attempts to <b>ignite</b> the <b>fuse</b> on firing using the gunpowder charge resulted in weapons that would often force the fuse into the grenade and make it explode in the barrel.|$|R
5|$|In {{the later}} Tiangong Kaiwu (The Exploitation of the Works of Nature) treatise, written by Song Yingxing in 1637, the ox bladder {{described}} by Jiao Yu is {{replaced with a}} lacquer bag and a cord pulled from a hidden ambusher located on the nearby shore, which would release a flint steel–wheel firing mechanism to <b>ignite</b> the <b>fuse</b> of the naval mine.|$|R

60|$|Then {{he turned}} away, and was rather {{longer than he}} liked persuading a damp match to <b>ignite.</b> The <b>fuse,</b> however, sparkled readily, and, groping {{his way across the}} logs, he {{clutched}} a ledge of rock. It was wet and slippery, and he slid back from it, hurting one arm, while, when he regained the narrow shelf, a voice was raised warningly above.|$|R
40|$|What is {{contained}} in Roots, the 587 -page narrative that captured an entire world population? The answer is not simple, nor is it overly complex, but rather an admixture of significant psychological, sociological, and timing factors that served to <b>ignite</b> the <b>fuse</b> of human fascination for the unknown, the hidden truths, the obscure, and the forbidden. This paper analyzes the impact and implications of Roots on many facets of American society...|$|R
50|$|To win, {{the team}} members must <b>ignite</b> a <b>fuse</b> that lights one of the gold forges. If the team is unsuccessful, they'll lose a flame and must return to the Poetess's tent to {{retrieve}} another one. If they lose all their flames, their opponents {{get the chance to}} win the gold by completing the remaining challenges using their flames. Their binding helps to impede their progress through the course.|$|R
6000|$|... 1081. On {{introducing}} a fine platina wire at x, and employing the electro-magnet at D, no visible effects occurred {{as long as}} contact was continued; but on breaking contact at G or E, the fine wire was instantly <b>ignited</b> and <b>fused.</b> A longer or thicker wire could be so adjusted at x as to show ignition, without fusion, every time the contact was broken at G or E.|$|R
5000|$|In 1939, the Japanese {{introduced}} the Type 89 grenade discharger, the Type 91 fragmentation grenade was {{fitted with a}} propellant base and time fuse. It did not explode upon contact, but was designed to <b>ignite</b> its <b>fuse</b> while in flight. A weak creep spring inside the grenade firing mechanism allowed the firing pin to be thrown back upon launching, <b>igniting</b> a time <b>fuse</b> with a 7-8 second delay. Using this system, the Type 91 grenades could be launched through jungle cover or through small openings without the danger of premature detonation in the event the grenade struck an object {{on its way to}} the target. [...] Although the Type 89 could be fired by a single person, it was typically operated with a crew of 3, enabling it to reach a rate of fire of about 25 rounds per minute.|$|R
5000|$|The shell fougasse {{was loaded}} with early black powder mortar shells (essentially a large version of an early black powder hand grenade) or {{incendiary}} [...] "carcasses". When fired, the powder charge would throw out the shells and <b>ignite</b> their <b>fuses,</b> so the projectiles would be scattered across the target area and then begin exploding, filling the area with fragmentation or flame from all directions in an effect similar to a cluster bomb.|$|R
25|$|While {{this seemed}} fine in theory, in {{practice}} it had multiple problems. The most prominent {{of all was}} that the arming method did not work as intended. In many cases pulling the loop was too difficult for one man to do and it required two men. For a lone soldier, the best method was to hold the grenade between the knees and pull on the loop with both hands. However, this often resulted in cutting the fingers in addition to <b>igniting</b> the <b>fuse.</b>|$|R
50|$|Igniter Cord is a {{commercial}} grade of visco fuse {{that is designed}} to <b>ignite</b> multiple safety <b>fuses.</b> Like visco, igniter cord burns with an external, visible flame. It is often heavily lacquered for water resistance, and sometimes has an inner wire core for mechanical strength.|$|R
5000|$|In 919, {{the first}} use of {{gunpowder}} in battle occurs with the Chinese Battle of Langshan Jiang (Wolf Mountain River), where the Wuyue naval fleet under Qian Yuanguan defeats the Wu fleet. Qian had used flamethrowers <b>ignited</b> by gunpowder <b>fuses</b> to burn the Wu fleet.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a perverse}} joke, Foster used {{a can of}} Pepsi filled with {{gunpowder}} and fitted with a 25-foot firework fuse to destroy the historic building. While the other boys arranged propane tanks around the building which they had previously stolen from a local Starvin' Marvin's, Foster <b>ignited</b> the <b>fuse</b> of the homemade bomb. The boys then retreated to a picnic table across the street where they could view the destruction. About 13 minutes later an intense explosion ripped through the building, causing an estimated $100,000 in damage.|$|R
50|$|The {{invention}} of gunpowder weapons revolutionized siege warfare, Gunpowder {{is said to}} have been conceived in China. It was when the Mongols, after invading China, went on to subdue Japan. Their ships sunk from being hit by a typhoon, resulting in half of their army drowning at sea. Marine archaeology has revealed that the Mongols were carrying gunpowder in ceramic pots, similar pots with <b>ignited</b> <b>fuses</b> had been shot from mechanical artillery against the Japanese defenders. Even the old Japanese paintings show the Japanese samurai defending themselves against bombs and rockets hurled by the invaders.Some historians have observed that only 14 percent men in Europe owned guns,over half of those guns were unusable during the later Middle Ages. The {{invention of}} gunpowder weapons replaced only catapults and onagers, the change was slow. Buying guns in those days was a costly affair, the cost of one gun was the equivalent of two months pay for a skilled artisan. By 1450, inventors improved the make of the gun and introduced the matchlock gun. Though inventors came with new technology, the process of reloading after every shot was very time consuming, by the time they were reloading the gun, the cavalry would charge and annihilate the entire unit of shooters.|$|R
5000|$|Tu Huo Qiang (Chinese: Pinyin: tūhuǒqiāng) {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} true guns. It consisted of a moso bamboo tube which had been partially hollowed out and loaded with gunpowder and a single projectile, called the zi kē (子窠). The gunpowder utilized in this time period did not have much explosive potential, and upon <b>igniting</b> the <b>fuse,</b> the Tu Huo Qiang more often than not shot out flames and smoke as much as the projectile itself. This weapon did not have much killing potential and was mainly used for its shock value as well as psychological advantage.|$|R
50|$|The team {{is later}} sent to Sheng Island, where Meilin was {{planning}} to launch a corrupted Fuse rocket at a populated area as a demonstration for interested buyers. They were able to lock the missile in place and Dalton kills Meilin, narrowly escaping as the corrupted <b>Fuse</b> <b>ignites,</b> destroying all life on the island.|$|R
500|$|The {{lieutenant}} {{had kept}} {{many of his}} men below deck and in anticipation of being boarded told them to prepare for close fighting. [...] Teach watched as {{the gap between the}} vessels closed, [...] and ordered his men to be ready. [...] The two vessels contacted one another as the Adventures grappling hooks hit their target and several grenades, made from powder and shot-filled bottles and <b>ignited</b> by <b>fuses,</b> broke across the sloop's deck. [...] As the smoke cleared, Teach led his men aboard, buoyant at the sight of Maynard's apparently empty ship, his men firing at the small group formed by the lieutenant and his men at the stern.|$|R
50|$|When {{the weapons}} {{were removed from}} the mound, this {{movement}} disturbed the bowl beneath them where the butt ends of the staffs were, which in turn <b>ignited</b> the <b>fuses.</b> According to the Wubei Huolongjing volume of the 17th century, the formula for this slow-burning incandescent material allowed it to burn continuously for 20 to 30 days without going out. This formula included 1 lb of white sandal wood powder, 3 oz of iron rust (ferric oxide), 5 oz of 'white' charcoal powder (from quicklime), 2 oz of willow charcoal powder, 6 oz of dried, ground, and powdered red dates, and 3 oz of bran.|$|R
6000|$|Ere {{many minutes}} had passed, John Claverhouse came plodding up {{the bed of}} the stream. Bellona was ambling about him, and they were in high feather, her short, snappy barks {{mingling}} with his deeper chest-notes. Arrived at the pool, he threw down the dip-net and sack, and drew from his hip-pocket what looked like a large, fat candle. But I knew it to be a stick of [...] "giant"; for such was his method of catching trout. He dynamited them. He attached the fuse by wrapping the [...] "giant" [...] tightly in a piece of cotton. Then he <b>ignited</b> the <b>fuse</b> and tossed the explosive into the pool.|$|R
6000|$|... "You perceive, Signor Console," [...] he {{said with}} new dignity, [...] "that this is nothing very new as a breech-loader, though I ask you to observe this little {{improvement}} for restoring the breech to its place, which is original. The grand feature of my invention, however, is this secret chamber in the breech, which is intended to hold an explosive of high potency, with a fuse coming out below. The gunner, finding his piece in danger, <b>ignites</b> this <b>fuse,</b> and takes refuge in flight. At the moment the enemy seizes the gun {{the contents of the}} secret chamber explode, demolishing the piece and destroying its captors." ...|$|R
50|$|Napoleon's retreat {{continued}} smoothly {{until early}} afternoon when the general tasked with destroying the only {{bridge over the}} Elster delegated the task to a Colonel Montfort. The colonel in turn passed this responsibility to a corporal, who {{was unaware of the}} carefully planned time schedule. The NCO <b>ignited</b> the <b>fuses</b> at 1:00 in the afternoon while the bridge was still crowded with retreating French troops and Oudinot's rearguard was still in Leipzig. The explosion and subsequent panic caused a rout that resulted in the deaths of thousands of French troops and the capture {{of tens of thousands of}} others. Marshal Poniatowski was one of the many who drowned while attempting to cross the river.|$|R
50|$|The No 6 {{was one of}} {{the intern}} grenades created because of {{problems}} associated with the No 1 Grenade.
