40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} study, a new {{magnetic}} powder based on magnetite {{can be used}} as a petroleum crude <b>oil</b> <b>collector.</b> Amidoximes based on rosin as a natural product can be prepared from a reaction between hydroxylamine and rosin/acrylonitrile adducts. The produced rosin amidoximes were used as capping agents for magnetite nanoparticles to prepare hydrophobic coated magnetic powders. A new class of monodisperse hydrophobic magnetite nanoparticles was prepared by a simple and inexpensive co-precipitation method. Iron ions and iodine were prepared by the reaction between ferric chloride and potassium iodide. The structure and morphology of magnetite capped with rosin amidoxime were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), zeta potential, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The magnetic properties were determined from vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analyses. These prepared magnetite nanoparticles were tested as bioactive nanosystems and their antimicrobial effects were investigated. The prepared nanomaterials were examined as a crude <b>oil</b> <b>collector</b> using magnetic fields. The results show promising data for the separation of the petroleum crude oil from aqueous solution i...|$|R

50|$|The rule of capture {{provides}} that an oil producer with a wellbore {{on his property}} is allowed to <b>drain</b> <b>oil</b> out from underneath his landâ€”even if some of that oil originated from a neighbor's land, migrating to the oil producer's land through geologic forces or drainage. The rule of capture gives landowners an incentive to pump out oil {{as quickly as possible}} by accerlerating their operations or drilling multiple wells to capture the oil of their neighbors. Such practice may deplete the gas pressure needed to force oil from the ground, which will reduce the amount of oil available for recovery from that reservoir. State law often limits the rule of capture to protect correlative rights of neighboring owners. Government agencies and state oil and gas conservation commissions, such as the Texas Railroad Commission, have developed conservation laws which regulate extraction by individual owners {{to protect the rights of}} the mineral owners and to prevent economic and physical waste.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the use of eucalyptus oils as both frother and collector in coal flotation. The application of eucalyptus oils as reagents in froth flotation dates {{back to the beginning of}} the process itself. It was realised early on that natural oils are complex mixtures of many different organic constituents. Essential oils of eucalypts are composed predominantly of terpenes, compounds which contain a sequence of two or more isoprene units (C 5 H 8) joined either head-to-head or head-to-tail. Monoterpenes (C 10) and sesquiterpenes (C 15) are the major classes of terpenes found in eucalyptus oils each of which can be divided into a number of sub-classes, varying across and within different species of the eucalypts. Ten eucalyptus oil samples were analysed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques. The results showed they contain a wide range of closely-related functional groups which might affect flotation. For each oil, surface activity was evaluated in a two-phase system using a froth column and a bubble sizer to estimate the dynamic foam stability index (DFI) and the critical coalescence concentration (CCC). On the basis of these parameters, it was shown that eucalyptol and Î±-pinene do not have frother properties and that E. Citriodora oil was the most promising frother, producing a better bubble size distribution than the industry standard frother, MIBC. Sequential laboratory flotation experiments were carried out using the tree-test on a Bowen Basin coal sample obtained from Peak Downs Mine. The Whiten equation was fitted to the experimental data to model the flotation response, allowing the frothing properties of the oils to be compared with MIBC. The flotation response curves were analysed using a new statistical methodology with the results showing that E. Citriodora oil has good frothing properties, comparable to MIBC. Timed laboratory batch flotation tests carried out to evaluate collecting effect showed that eucalyptus oils generally give a higher ultimate recovery, but lower rate constants compared to the industry-standard collector, diesel. Eucalyptol and Î±-pinene were shown to be the most effective eucalyptus <b>oil</b> <b>collectors.</b> The interaction between maceral species and the flotation reagents was evaluated using coal grain analysis (CGA). Flotation models are presented for different flotation products based on the microscopic characterisation of individual coal grains. The maceral and mineral abundance data demonstrate that MIBC floats vitrinite better than E. Citriodora oil, while their inertinite recovery is comparable. Eucalyptus <b>oil</b> <b>collectors,</b> compared to diesel, have better vitrinite recovery and higher inertinite loss to tailings...|$|R

40|$|Mineral {{processing}} {{plays an}} important part in providing our society with much needed resources. These processes, however, could be made much more efficient. Advancements in this field would enable a population to make economical use of its resources. One widely-used ore processing method to separate target minerals from other minerals is froth flotation. This report summarizes the method and outcome of 48 flotation experiments, performed at the Titania A/S Ilmenite mine, Hauge i Dalane, Norway, in which 6 different tall <b>oil</b> <b>collectors</b> and 2 paraffin solvents were used in a pilot scale batch process. The approach used is controlling the types and amounts of reagents, as well as the ratio between reagents. The amount of feed, rotor speed, air consumption and conditioning time are kept constant. The time of tapping concentrate is noted, dry concentrate is weighed and the TiO 2 -contents of the feed, tailings and concentrate are assayed. Results are qualitatively analyzed with a TiO 2 recovery vs. concentrate TiO 2 grade graph created in Microsoft Excel. Within the randomly occurring unmeasured ore variation the combination of Sylvatal 20 S tall oil and ExxonMobil Exxsol D 80 paraffin in a 2 : 1 volume ratio yields the best TiO 2 recovery at the same concentrate grade.

40|$|This {{experimental}} thesis {{presents a}} study of two diffusive EOR techniques; low salinity waterflooding in 2 D sandstone silicon wafer micromodels and miscible CO 2 injection in tight shale core samples. Tests were conducted using both refined oils and crude oil. During low salinity waterflooding, a salinity gradient was set up between low salinity water injected through a fracture and a porous network partially saturated with high salinity brine. Primary <b>drained</b> <b>oil</b> acted as a semi-permeable membrane between the two aqueous phases. As part of a recently started CO 2 project, experiments involved injection of liquid and supercritical CO 2 through tight shale cores to produce oil primarily by molecular diffusion. Osmotic diffusion in presence of a salinity gradient resulted in increased water flux and oil mobilization, visualized within separate pores and in networks of interconnected pores. Diffusive transport mechanisms were identified as water diffusion through film-flow and osmosis. Two effective processes were observed by the identified mechanisms, 1) water dispersion and water droplet growth and 2) residual oil displacement and mobilization. Water flux through a refined oil membrane increased with brine salinity and decreased with increasing oil carbon number. Highest oil displacement and mobilization was observed with low carbon numbered oil (n-Hexane) and moderate high salinity brine (5...|$|R

40|$|The {{transport}} {{of crude oil}} requires the adoption of safety measures in port terminals, especially during the operations of loading and unloading of crude oil. Accidents at sea are further serious cause of oil pouring and cause pollution. For these reasons the port terminals are equipped with oil skimmers and boats that intervene promptly to define and collect the spill at sea. The technology of oil skimmers is subject to continuous innovation, to ensure prompt actions when operating in restricted waters, as may be {{the area of the}} Gulf of Trieste, Northern Adriatic Sea or other restricted areas within the refineries and oil terminals. In the paper the principles by which the oil skimmers recover and transfer oil and some of the more salient changes introduced recently in this technology will be explained.
