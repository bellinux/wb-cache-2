60|$|I {{would not}} give the {{impression}} that most of the amusements were not in every respect decorous. As a means of pleasure, the merry-go-round, both horizontal with horses and vertical with swinging cradles, prevailed, and was none the worse for being called by the French name of carrousel, for our people aniglicize the word, and squeeze the last drop of Gallic wickedness from it by pronouncing it carousal. At every other step there were machines for weighing you and ascertaining your height; there were photographers' booths, and X-ray apparatus for showing you the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> watch; and in one open tent I saw a gentleman (with his back to the public) having his fortune read in the lines of his hand by an Egyptian seeress. Of course there was everywhere soda, and places of the softer drinks abounded.|$|E

60|$|Among {{these were}} {{a family of}} white rabbits, which the boys kept in a little hutch {{at the bottom of}} the yard. They were of no more use than the goat was, but they were at least not mischievous, and there was only one of them that would bite, and he would not bite if you would take him up close behind the ears, so that he could not get at you. The rest were very good-natured, and would let you smooth them, or put them <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> shirt-bosom, or anything. They would eat cabbage or bread or apples out of your hand; and it was fun to see their noses twitch. Otherwise they had no accomplishments. All you could do with them was to trade with other boys, or else keep the dogs from them; it was pretty {{exciting}} to keep the dogs from them.

Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge {{on the right side of}} his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession." ...|$|E

You're going to continue supplying me and taking my paper until the pinch is over. How you're going to do it is your trouble, not mine.

6000|$|Her {{declaration}} seemed {{somehow to}} close the incident, {{and we were all}} silent a moment, which I employed in looking about the room, and taking in with my literary sense the simplicity and even bareness of its furnishing. There was the bed where the invalid lay, and near the head a table with a pile of books and a kerosene-lamp on it, and I decided that she was a good deal wakeful, and that she read by that lamp when she could not sleep at night. Then there were the hard chairs we sat on, and some home-made hooked rugs, in rounds and ovals, scattered about the clean floor; there was a small melodeon pushed against the wall; the windows had paper shades, and I recalled that I had not seen any blinds {{on the outside of the}} house. Over the head of the bed hung a cavalryman's sword, with its belt--the sword that Mrs. Makely had spoken of. It struck me as a room where a great many things might have happened, and I said: [...] "You can't think, Mrs. Camp, how glad I am to see the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> house.

"It {{would be}} better to put such {{questions}} to the wise men of Egypt, next time you have the chance, than to me," [...] returned Dromas, [...] "for I am not deep enough in philosophy to answer you. Nevertheless, it does not seem presumptuous to make a guess. That there is abundance of fire beneath the ground on which we tread is clear from the burning mountains which you and I have seen on our way from Hellas. Probably there are many such mountains elsewhere, for if the fire did not find an escape in many places, it would assuredly burst our world asunder. What set the inside of the world on fire at the beginning is, of course, a puzzle; and why everything does not catch fire and blaze up is another puzzle--for it is plain that if you were to set fire to the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> booth, the outside would be shrivelled up immediately. Then," [...] continued Dromas, knitting his brows and warming with his subject, [...] "there must be a big lake under the earth somewhere, and quite close to the fire, which sets it a-boiling and makes it boil over--thus." ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{was brought}} up in a {{community}} of Transcendental Meditation he was also influenced early on by Sufism. His father was a translator for Muzaffer Ozak, who was a head sheikh of the Halveti-Jerrahi order of Dervishes.

6000|$|You {{will all}} {{admit that there}} is neither romance nor comfort in waiting at your own or at any one else's door on a windy and rainy day, till the servant comes {{from the end of}} the house to open it. You all know the {{critical}} nature of that opening--the drift of wind into the passage, the impossibility of putting down the umbrella at the proper moment without getting a cupful of water dropped down the back <b>of</b> <b>your</b> neck from the top of the door-way; and you know how little these inconveniences are abated by the common Greek portico at the top of the steps. You know how the east winds blow through those unlucky couples of pillars, which are all that your architects find consistent with due observance of the Doric order. Then, away with these absurdities; and the next house you build, insist upon having the pure old Gothic porch, walled in on both sides, with its pointed arch entrance and gable roof above. Under that, you can put down your umbrella at your leisure, and, if you will, stop a moment to talk with your friend as you give him the parting shake of the hand. And if now and then a wayfarer found a moment's rest on a stone seat on each side of it, I believe you would find the <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> houses not one whit the less comfortable; and, if you answer me, that were such refuges built in the open streets, they would become mere nests of filthy vagrants, I reply that I do not despair of such a change in the administration of the poor laws of this country, as shall no longer leave any of our fellow creatures in a state in which they would pollute the steps of our houses by resting upon them for a night.

They cause the naked to lodge without shelter, that they have no covering in the cold. They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock, for want of a shelter."[14] ...|$|R
