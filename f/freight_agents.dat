50|$|With {{companies}} operating globally, {{the need}} to increase supply chain visibility and reduce risk, improve velocity and reduce costs - {{all at the same}} time - requires a common technological solution. Non-asset based providers perform functions such as consultation on packaging and transportation, freight quoting, financial settlement, auditing, tracking, customer service and issue resolution. However, they do not employ any truck drivers or warehouse personnel, and they don’t own any physical freight distribution assets of their own - no trucks, no storage trailers, no pallets, and no warehousing. A non-assets based provider consists of a team of domain experts with accumulated freight industry expertise and information technology assets. They fill a role similar to <b>freight</b> <b>agents</b> or brokers, but maintain a significantly greater degree of “hands on” involvement in the transportation of products. These providers are 4PL and 5PL services.|$|E

Through this and his membership of the International Express Carriers Conference (IECC) https://web.archive.org/web/20080718174808/http://www.jcampbell.com/articles/CP_shape_pub_pol.pdf he worked steadfastly to dispel the 'cowboy' image of the courier industry and promote it as a respected worldwide enterprise on which the business community could depend. He was a recognised expert on the complexities of international customs procedures for express shipments and worked tirelessly to achieve parity of treatment with postal administrations. He contributed valuable input to the European Commission in formulating its Paper on Community Postal Policy, ensuring that it was aware of the courier industry's interests. This helpfully reinforced the line which the Department of Trade and Industry took with the Commission. Having left school in 1941 Bertie Coxall joined the RAF and was commissioned as a navigator, serving in Canada and the Middle East. On demobilisation in 1947 he joined LEP as a Customs Entry Clerk and remained there for 20 years, through LEP's takeover first by American Airlines and then by Pan American Airways (Pan Am), rising to managerial level. In 1966 finding he could not progress in Pan Am without emigrating to the United States, he resigned to form his own company, Airport Courier Services Ltd (ACSL), providing document transmission by motorcycle within the Heathrow area between <b>freight</b> <b>agents</b> and airlines. In 1969, he expanded operations by sending an employee daily to Paris and back. This innovative air courier service was gradually extended to other destinations across the world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Freight {{movement}} {{is a dynamic}} process involving with complex interaction among many agents by which the commodities are flowed through supply chains. Simulation based model allows such dynamic and complex interaction system to be undertaken. Simulation based multi-agent approach is therefore utilized to model the behaviors of agents and their interactions in supply chains in order that the mechanism of freight {{movement is}} better demonstrated. This model simulates day-to-day activities of agents (including, retailers, manufacturers, and suppliers) in product acquisition, production, and distribution. Systematic framework of the proposed model permits wide variety of application. Feedback and learning of <b>freight</b> <b>agents</b> and variation in freight traffic demand can be captured by the proposed model. This paper discusses the on-going research of supply chain simulation and provides the modeling framework, mathematical formulation, {{and the application of}} the model to the supply chain of food industry in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area...|$|E
40|$|The {{commodity}} distribution model {{proposed in}} this paper is developed {{in such a way}} that the movement of commodities is explained as an outcome of its flow through several <b>freight</b> <b>agents</b> in a supply chain. As commodity flow is fundamentally determined by the demand, the proposed model is developed using a discrete choice model considering the individual behavior of a customer to decide the suppliers from which to purchase and the amount of commodity acquired from each of the suppliers. The model not only takes into account the interplay between shipper and customer in a supply chain but also captures the spatial interactions among alternatives and among customers since spatial effects generally impact customer preference. In this study, we developed and compared several model specifications, that is, with and without incorporating spatial interactions. The empirical results of the model applied to analyze the urban commodity distribution in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area indicate that integrating both spatial interactions among alternatives and among customers statisticall...|$|E
40|$|In most cases, {{logistical}} planning {{tasks are}} a complex {{problem that is}} difficult to solve because of dynamic influences that cannot be foreseen. The concept of autonomous cooperating processes is an approach whereby the logistical objects themselves solve those tasks. Each object in the transport chain (freight, means of transport, warehouse [...] .) is represented by a separate independent software unit (a so-called agent). These agents can interact and negotiate with each other. Each agent looks for a partial solution that is beneficial to the local object. In our approach, we put a focus on <b>freight</b> <b>agents</b> that observe the conditions during the process of transportation. Based on the evaluation of temperature measurement data, which are derived from a wireless sensor network inside the cargo hold, the remaining days of acceptable quality are predicted. In the case of an interruption of the cold chain, the agents can send warning messages to the freight owner or even make decisions on their own (e. g. a change to the planned route) to optimize the quality of the freight items on their arrival...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} thirty years {{segmentation}} has been recognised as a fundamental concept in the understanding of a market. This research undertakes a benefit segmentation of the passenger and freight, sea and air transport markets between Great Britain and Ireland (both Northern Ireland and Eire). In so doing, two areas which have been under-researched are addressed; segmentation in a transport market and the Irish sea passenger and freight market. The dominant features of the Irish sea passenger and freight markets are identified; seasonality in the passenger market and imbalance in the freight market. The concept of segmentation is applied to the short-sea passenger and freight market and a conceptual model for the research is developed. Extensive data collection in the passenger markets takes place over a twelve month period. Four surveys are conducted on board ferries (on the Larne- Stranraer, Holyhead-DunLaoghaire and Fishguard-Rosslare routes) and in airport departure lounges (Belfast City airport, Belfast International airport and Dublin airport) at three monthly intervals. Two postal surveys are conducted in the freight market, one addressed to shippers of goods and the other to carriers. Two sets of analyses are conducted. The first is concerned with presenting an overall profile of the markets and identifying areas where differences occur in the markets. This structural variation is found to exist in the ferry passenger market and to a lesser extent, in the air passenger market. The second set of analyses undertakes a benefit segmentation of the markets. Benefit segments (groups of passengers and freight customers who choose the service for similar reasons) are constructed for car and foot passengers on each route, business and non-business passengers at each airport, freight shippers, <b>freight</b> <b>agents</b> purchasing air transport services and <b>freight</b> <b>agents</b> purchasing sea transport services. The differing transport service needs of the segments are discussed and comparisons made. The segments are profiled in terms of independent variables. Travel behaviour, buying behaviour and demographic characteristics are used to profile segments in the passenger market. Product characteristics, transport service characteristics and company characteristics are used to profile benefit segments in the freight market. The benefit segments may be used to guide resource allocation for the ferry company by suggesting how the results of the benefit segmentation may influence the marketing mix variables.

40|$|AbstractModeling {{transportation}} systems at the microscopic level is currently gaining favor among researchers throughout the world. A multi-agent system, {{which is one}} method of microscopic modeling, is a dynamic framework dealing with the behavior of each individual actor in the transport system, and is especially favored for passenger transport models. Likewise, freight systems need a similar framework to better represent the interactions amongst <b>freight</b> <b>agents,</b> as large numbers of heterogeneous freight actors and other factors are involved. This paper proposes an extension of a multi-agent transport modeling system to cover the area of freight movement. The focus {{of this paper is}} at the stage of commodity distribution, in order to model the links between suppliers and receivers of commodities. The model is developed based on the principal of commodity movement through supply chains. The structure is a demand derived model, where receivers are the decision makers who choose their suppliers. The model is constructed based on the discrete choice method, considering the constraints of the amount of the commodity generated and the amount desired by each of the companies, travel impedance and attractive factors of the shippers. The model is developed and applied to the movement of urban freight in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. This study aims to {{identify}} the determinants of transport mode choice and the constraints on shifting freight in New Zealand (NZ) from road to rail and/or coastal shipping, and to quantify the trade-off between factors affecting shippers’ perceptions, to assist in increasing the share of freight moved by non-road transport modes. Methodology. A revealed preference survey of 183 freight shippers, including small and medium enterprises and <b>freight</b> <b>agents</b> in NZ, is used to investigate whether freight shippers’ characteristics affect their ranked preference for attributes related to mode choice and modal shift. Additionally, a rank-ordered logistic (ROL) model is estimated using the ranking data. Findings. The results reveal several distinct types of transport mode choice behaviour within the sample and show how the preferences for timeliness, cost, accessibility, damage and loss, customer service, and suitability vary between industry groups and business types. Also, the ROL method allows us {{to identify}} heterogeneity in preferences for mode choice and mode shift factors for freight within NZ. The results imply that NZ shippers ranked transport time as the most significant constraint upon distributing goods by rail, while accessibility and load size were the most significant constraints upon using coastal shipping. The study also identifies how NZ shippers’ modal shift constraints {{vary according to the}} firm’s individual or logistical characteristics. Research implications. This study informs freight transport policy makers about the needs of NZ shippers by providing quantitative measures of the intensity of preference for the various mode choice factors. Practical implications. Those involved in freight transport have a better basis for formulating transport policy...|$|E
