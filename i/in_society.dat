5|$|During the {{formative}} years of women's rights movements, {{the difference between}} the sexes was more or less taken for granted in that their roles, functions, aims and desires were different. As a result, they were not only to be reared differently but treated differently also. Over the course of time, this difference itself became a major reason for initiating women's movements. Early 19th century reformers argued that the difference between men and women was no reason for the subjection of women <b>in</b> <b>society.</b> However, later reformers were of the opinion that indeed it was this particular difference that subjugated women to their roles <b>in</b> <b>society,</b> for example, as mothers. Therefore, there was a need for the proper care of women's rights. With the formation of women's organisations and their own participation in campaigns, their roles as mothers was again stressed but in a different light: this time the argument was for women's rights to speech, education and emancipation. However, the image of women with the mother as a symbol underwent changes over time – from an emphasis on family to the creation of an archetypal mother figure, evoking deep, often atavistic images.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} early modern {{individuals}} experienced {{a period of}} youth in the modern sense.

50|$|<b>In</b> various <b>societies</b> {{the choice}} of partner is often limited to {{suitable}} persons from specific social groups. <b>In</b> some <b>societies</b> the rule is that a partner is selected from an individual's own social group - endogamy, this {{is often the case}} in class and caste based <b>societies.</b> But <b>in</b> other <b>societies</b> a partner must be chosen from a different group than one's own - exogamy, this may be the case <b>in</b> <b>societies</b> practicing totemic religion where society is divided into several exogamous totemic clans, such as most Aboriginal Australian <b>societies.</b> <b>In</b> other <b>societies</b> a person is expected to marry their cross-cousin, a woman must marry her father's sister's son and a man must marry his mother's brother's daughter - this is often the case if either a society has a rule of tracing kinship exclusively through patrilineal or matrilineal descent groups as among the Akan people of West Africa. Another kind of marriage selection is the levirate marriage in which widows are obligated to marry their husband's brother, mostly found <b>in</b> <b>societies</b> where kinship is based on endogamous clan groups.|$|R
