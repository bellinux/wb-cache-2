Results of numerical integration are used to identify three distinct types of motion, including solutions that are apparently limit cycles.

In order to trace different branches at the bifurcation point on the response curve (amplitude versus frequency of excitation plot), an arc length continuation technique along with the incremental harmonic balance (IHBC) method is employed. The stability of the solution is investigated by the Floquet theory using Hsu’s scheme. The periodic solutions obtained by the IHBC method are compared with these obtained by the numerical integration of the equation of motion.

40|$|We {{describe}} the induced geometry on several classes of Kodaira moduli spaces of rational curves in twistor spaces. By constructing connections and frames on the moduli spaces we build and review twistor theories pertaining to relativistic and non-relativistic geometries. Focussing on {{the cases of}} three- and five-dimensional moduli spaces we establish novel twistor theories of Newton-Cartan spacetimes. We generalise a canonical class of connections on Kodaira moduli spaces to encompass torsion and prove that in three dimensions deformations of the twistor space's holomorphic structure induce Newton-Cartan structures with torsion. In five dimensions the canonical connections contain generalised Coriolis forces, and here also we consider the introduction of torsion by deformation. Non-relativistic limits are exhibited as <b>jumping</b> <b>phenomena</b> of normal bundles.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the nonlinear characterization of a single-axis acoustic levitator and {{the analysis of}} the influence of nonlinear effects on the acoustic levitation of small spheres. First, the nonlinear characterization of the levitator is performed by applying an electronic balance to measure the acoustic radiation force that acts on the reflector {{as a function of the}} separation distance between the transducer and the reflector. Then, small spheres of different materials are acoustically levitated and a high-speed camera is used to obtain the sphere position as a function of time for different separation distances. The measurement of the acoustic radiation force on the reflector shows that the force becomes asymmetric, leading to a <b>jump</b> <b>phenomenon</b> on force-distance curve. Measurements with the high-speed camera show that, depending on the density of the levitated sphere, it can falls over the reflector when the <b>jump</b> <b>phenomenon</b> occurs...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} rare case of slow-fast form of {{atrioventricular}} nodal reentrant tachycardia with delayed activation {{in the low}} septal right atrium (His bundle area). During supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), electrocardiogram showed “pseudo-positive P waves” in II, III, and aVF leads. SVT was induced by atrial extrastimulus with marked AH prolongation (i. e., <b>jump</b> <b>phenomenon).</b> Ventricular pacing showed a decremental retrograde conduction without <b>jump</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> Double atrial potentials were observed in the His bundle area during SVT and during ventricular pacing. The first electrogram of these split potentials, which was the earliest activation during SVT and during ventricular pacing, showed a dull and small deflection, whereas the second electrogram was sharp and clear. The interval of these discrete potentials was 70 msec during SVT. After a standard slow pathway ablation, SVT could never be induced by any programmed stimuli. It was concluded that in this case, the conduction disturbance across the tendon of Todaro was likely to cause the delayed atrial activation in the His bundle area, which created the pseudo-positive (biphasic. retrograde P wave...|$|E

Its goal is to provide the feedback control mechanism enabling one to enlarge the flight envelope by increasing the flutter speed, and also to control the character, benign/catastrophic of the flutter instability boundary. Structural and aerodynamic nonlinearities are included in the aeroelastic governing equations, and linear and nonlinear feedback controls in both plunging and pitching are employed in conjunction with proportional velocity feedback controls. The attention of the paper is focused on multiple Hopf bifurcations. In particular, the <b>jumping</b> <b>phenomenon</b> found in our previous work will be further investigated to reveal the physical implications. It is found that such a jumping occurs when the system has multiple families of limit cycles bifurcating from a same set of parameter values with multiple solutions for frequencies.
