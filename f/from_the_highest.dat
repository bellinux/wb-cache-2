5|$|QPR's victory {{caused a}} problem for the Football Association as {{typically}} the League Cup winner would qualify for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, but one of the criteria for that competition was that the team must come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> tier of that country's league system. QPR was replaced in the following season's European competition by a First Division side.|$|E
5|$|The late 1950s saw a sharp {{downturn}} in Sunderland's fortunes, {{and the club}} was once again implicated in a major financial scandal in 1957. Found guilty of making payments to players {{in excess of the}} maximum wage, they were fined £5,000 (£ today), and their chairman and three directors were suspended. The following year, Sunderland were relegated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> division {{for the first time in}} their 68-year league history.|$|E
5|$|The {{rainwater}} which {{falls on}} Poh Ern Shih is collected from surface run-offs and rain gutters {{and used to}} irrigate the temple grounds, {{as well as to}} generate electricity used for charging the batteries of in-house motorised wheelchairs. The electricity is produced by water <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> floor of the temple passing through hydroelectric-generators. A purification system is also being installed, so that the collected rainwater can be filtered and made potable.|$|E

50|$|The {{first route}} opened in 1872 was from Bute Docks Pier Head northwards to <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Street. Later that year another route was opened <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Street eastwards via The Hayes and Queen Street to Roath later in 1879 {{extended}} a further half mile eastwards. Also in 1879 a route westwards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Street to Canton was constructed. Another route was built <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Street southwards to Clarence Road terminating {{near to the}} Pier Head line and finally a route was opened <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Street north to Cathays via Salisbury Road. The complete network was operated by 52 open top double deck horse trams using 3 depots.|$|R

5|$|As in {{most other}} parts of the world, the decades {{following}} the World War II were relatively free from football violence and the supporter culture did not change much. Swedish football culture started to change in the late 1960s, becoming heavily inspired and influenced by the English supporter culture. This flourished in the 1970s and 1980s, giving birth {{to some of the most}} well-known Swedish supporters clubs, AIK's Black Army, Djurgårdens IF's Blue Saints (later Järnkaminerna), and IFK Göteborg's supporters club, Änglarna (the Angels). The first attempt to found an IFK supporters club was made in 1969, but interest diminished when IFK Göteborg were relegated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> league the following year. The supporters club was not re-founded until 1973, which is considered the year of foundation of Änglarna.|$|E
5|$|Bush was {{appointed}} to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1938, and soon became its chairman. As chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), and later director of OSRD, Bush coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. Bush was a well-known policymaker and public intellectual during World War II, when he was in effect the first presidential science advisor. As head of NDRC and OSRD, he initiated the Manhattan Project, and ensured that it received top priority <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> levels of government. In Science, The Endless Frontier, his 1945 report to the President of the United States, Bush called for an expansion of government support for science, and he pressed for the creation of the National Science Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Needham (died 3 May 1731), {{also known}} as Mother Needham, was an English procuress and brothel-keeper of 18th-century London, who has been {{identified}} as the bawd greeting Moll Hackabout in the first plate of William Hogarth's series of satirical etchings, A Harlot's Progress. Although Needham was notorious in London at the time, little is recorded of her life, and no genuine portraits of her survive. Her house was the most exclusive in London and her customers came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> strata of fashionable society, but she eventually ran afoul of the moral reformers of the day and {{died as a result of}} the severe treatment she received after being sentenced to stand in the pillory.|$|E

5|$|In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell {{advances}} {{the notion}} that the success of students of different cultures or different socio-economic backgrounds is in fact highly correlated to the time students spent in school or in educationally rich environments. He describes the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success {{stems from the fact that}} they simply spent more hours at school during the school year and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than students <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> socio-economic group.|$|E
5|$|Needham {{may have}} {{introduced}} Charteris to Sally Salisbury around 1708. Salisbury was the pre-eminent prostitute {{of the day}} and was kept by Charteris for a short time as mistress at the beginning of her career. When her previous bawd, Mother Wisebourne, died in 1719, she became a member of Needham's household and brought with her a clientele <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> ranks of society. Salisbury brought further fame to Needham's house by involving another of her girls in the theft of the Earl of Cardigan's clothes. The two women accompanied him to Newmarket where he became drunk, and after putting him to bed at an inn they stole his clothes and jewellery and returned to London. The Earl treated the matter as a joke.|$|E
5|$|QPR's {{victory was}} the first {{occasion}} a team from the Third Division had won a major trophy in England. Both teams received £18,000 as {{their share of the}} gate receipts. QPR's victory created a problem for the Football League management committee. On previous occasions, one of the three nominations for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was the winner of the League Cup. However, the Fairs Cup committee required that only teams <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> tier of a nation's league system could enter. In the end, Nottingham Forest, Leeds United and Liverpool qualified for the following season's competition.|$|E

5|$|The city {{generally}} slopes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> {{point in}} the Northeast to the lowest {{point in the}} Southwest towards the Missouri River. Prominent tributaries of the river are Perche Creek, Hinkson Creek, and Flat Branch Creek. Along these and other creeks in the area can be found large valleys, cliffs, and cave systems such as that in Rock Bridge State Park {{just south of the}} city. These creeks are largely responsible for numerous stream valleys giving Columbia hilly terrain similar to the Ozarks while also having prairie flatland typical of northern Missouri. Columbia also operates several greenbelts with trails and parks throughout town.|$|E
5|$|The {{inscriptions}} {{follow the}} 14th-century convention of showing figures, imagery and motifs {{associated with the}} saved to Christ's right, {{and those of the}} damned to his left. The words beneath the lily (the benedicti) read upwards towards Heaven, their curves leaning in towards Christ. The text to the left (the maledicti) flows in the opposite direction; <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> point downwards. The inscriptions to Christ's right are decorated in light colours, {{to the extent that they}} are usually difficult to discern in reproductions. The lettering opposite faces downwards, and is applied with black paint.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} Class C retail {{licenses}} for bars, restaurants, and liquor stores {{is limited by}} population and often by municipal ordinances. Licenses are typically obtained from existing licensees who choose to sell, or when a new license is offered as a town's population grows. As a result, the price for a retail license is often prohibitively expensive. The sale of a new license is usually conducted by public auction. The intense competition can benefit a town by generating {{several hundred thousand dollars}} of revenue <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> bidder. A 2006 license auction in Cherry Hill, New Jersey set the state record at $1.5 million.|$|E

5|$|While {{the birth}} date of John Komnenos Asen is unknown, his origin is clearly {{documented}} in the sources. On both sides, he descended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> ranks of 14th-century Bulgarian nobility. He was born to Keratsa Petritsa, a daughter of despot Shishman of Vidin, and Sratsimir, the despot of Kran. John's mother was a descendant of the Asen dynasty as a grand granddaughter of Tsar Ivan Asen II. His siblings were Ivan Alexander, who would ascend to the Bulgarian throne in 1331, and Helena, who married Serbian ruler Stephen Dušan in 1332. Even though John was {{commonly referred to as}} a Komnenos in the sources, his relations to that Byzantine family are rather scarce. He had rights to that name either through his mother's descent from the Asens, themselves related to the Komnenoi, or through his marriage to Anna Palaiologina.|$|E
