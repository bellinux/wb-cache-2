40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{construction}} and consolidation of the political brand ‘The Tribune-Jester ’ {{in relation to the}} use of ethnic humor in the form of joking in Romanian parliamentary discourse by a controversial political figure of Romanian politics, Corneliu Vadim Tudor. The data come from transcripts of the meetings from the internet section ‘Parliamentary Debates ’ of the Senate and are analyzed using concepts from discourse analysis, pragmatics and conversation analysis. Under the guise of humor, the Member of Parliament (MP) profits by the rules of parliamentary politics and succeeds in portraying himself as a populist politician, in rebelling against the establishment and in voicing his nationalistic attitudes. Key Words: Joking mode, political brand, parliamentary discourse, ethnic humor. Humor as a branding strategy in political discourse.

40|$|The {{brand is}} a {{critical}} factor of success of the organizations. When well managed, they become financially valuable and strategic assets. This study aims at understanding {{the relation between the}} customers and the brand in the process of purchases business-to-business. It aimed at identifying the motivation of the customers in the acquisition of the brand to know if the communication efforts interfere with the decision of purchase, and to understand the importance of the brand in such process. Through research carried along the distributors of the Krill beer in the south region of Brazil, it is concluded that the brand has importance in the process of purchases business-to-business, providing bigger sales volume and profitability. However, it was evident that the lack of investments in the media and too much effort on communication make hard the brand valuation. Due to such scenery, one perceived that the branding process can empower the relationship between distributors and the beer brands. As marcas são fatores críticos de sucesso para as organizações e quando bem administradas tornam-se valiosos ativos financeiros e estratégicos. O presente estudo tem como foco a marca, e como objetivo compreender sua importância no processo de compras business-to-business. Mais especificamente, o trabalho buscou conhecer a motivação dos clientes na aquisição da marca, saber se os esforços de comunicação interferem na decisão de compra e compreender a importância da marca no processo de compra. Por meio de pesquisa realizada junto aos distribuidores da cerveja Krill na região Sul do Brasil, concluiu-se que a marca tem importância no processo de compras business-to-business, proporcionando maior volume de vendas e lucratividade. No entanto, ficou evidente que a falta de investimentos na mídia e demais esforços de comunicação dificultam a valorização da marca. Diante deste cenário, conclui-se que o processo <b>de</b> <b>branding</b> pode alavancar o relacionamento entre os distribuidores e a marca, ao proporcionar condições para a criação de vantagens competitivas sustentáveis...|$|E
