40|$|Establishing a {{quantitative}} {{understanding of the}} abundance of peroxynitric acid (HNO 4) is of interest because the reaction of OH with HNO 4 {{is believed to be}} a significant sink for HO(x) in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere. We present concentration profiles of KNO 4 obtained by the MkIV Fourier transform infrared spectrometer using the solar occultation technique during two flights, one at 35 N on 25 September 1993 (930925) and the other near 66 N on 7 May 1997 (970507). The observations of HN 04 present an apparent dilemma: the calculated profile for HNO 4 found using standard kinetics is in relatively good agreement with the mid-latitude observations, but the calculated profile for HNO 4 found using the same kinetics overestimates the high-latitude summer observations by nearly a factor of two. Resolution of this dilemma is the focus of our investigation. We show that introduction into our photochemical model of a speculative long-wave (lambda greater than 650 nm) photolytic pathway for HNO 4 leads to good agreement between theory and observation of HN 04 for both the mid-latitude and high-latitude regions. <b>Implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> of HO(x) are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Some {{biological}} particles, such as Snomax, {{are very}} active ice nucleating particles, inducing heterogeneous freezing in supercooled water at temperatures above − 15 {{and up to}} − 2  °C. Despite their exceptional freezing abilities, large uncertainties remain regarding the atmospheric abundance of biological ice nucleating particles, and their contribution to atmospheric ice nucleation. It {{has been suggested that}} small biological ice nucleating macromolecules or fragments can be carried on the surfaces of dust and other atmospheric particles. This could combine the atmospheric abundance of dust particles with the ice nucleating strength of biological material to create strongly enhanced and abundant ice nucleating surfaces in the atmosphere, with significant <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> and distribution of atmospheric ice nucleating particles, and their consequent effects on cloud microphysics and mixed-phase clouds. The new critical surface area g framework that was developed by Beydoun et al.  (2016) is extended to produce a heterogeneous ice nucleation mixing model that can predict the freezing behavior of multicomponent particle surfaces immersed in droplets. The model successfully predicts the immersion freezing properties of droplets containing Snomax bacterial particles across a mass concentration range of 7 orders of magnitude, by treating Snomax as comprised of two distinct distributions of heterogeneous ice nucleating activity. Furthermore, the model successfully predicts the immersion freezing behavior of a low-concentration mixture of Snomax and illite mineral particles, a proxy for the biological material–dust (bio-dust) mixtures observed in atmospheric aerosols. It is shown that even at very low Snomax concentrations in the mixture, droplet freezing at higher temperatures is still determined solely by the second less active and more abundant distribution of heterogeneous ice nucleating activity of Snomax, while freezing at lower temperatures is determined solely by the heterogeneous ice nucleating activity of pure illite. This demonstrates that in this proxy system, biological ice nucleating particles do not compromise their ice nucleating activity upon mixing with dust and no new range of intermediary freezing temperatures associated with the mixture of ice nucleating particles of differing activities is produced. The study is the first to directly examine the freezing behavior of a mixture of Snomax and illite and presents the first multicomponent ice nucleation model experimentally evaluated using a wide range of ice nucleating particle concentration mixtures in droplets...|$|E

40|$|We analyze summertime {{photochemistry}} {{near the}} surface in Beijing, China, using a 1 -D photochemical model (Regional chEmical and trAnsport Model, REAM- 1 D) constrained by in situ observations, focusing on the budgets of RO x (OH + HO 2 + RO 2) radicals and O 3 formation. While the modeling analysis focuses on near-surface photochemical budgets, the <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> of O 3 in the planetary boundary layer are also discussed. In terms of daytime average, the total RO x primary production rate {{near the surface}} in Beijing is 6. 6 ppbv per hour (ppbv h − 1, among the highest found in urban atmospheres. The largest primary RO x source in Beijing is photolysis of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), which produces HO 2 and RO 2 at 2. 5 ppbv h − 1 and 1. 7 ppbv h − 1, respectively. Photolysis of excess HONO from an unknown heterogeneous source is the predominant primary OH source at 2. 2 ppbv h − 1, much larger than that of O 1 D+H 2 O (0. 4 ppbv h − 1). The largest RO x sink is via OH + NO 2 reaction (1. 6 ppbv h − 1), followed by formation of RO 2 NO 2 (1. 0 ppbv h − 1) and RONO 2 (0. 7 ppbv h − 1). Due to the large aerosol surface area, aerosol uptake of HO 2 appears to be another important radical sink, although the estimate of its magnitude is highly variable depending on the uptake coefficient value used. The daytime average O 3 production and loss rates near the surface are 32 ppbv h − 1 and 6. 2 ppbv h − 1, respectively. Assuming NO 2 {{to be the source}} of excess HONO, the NO 2 to HONO transformation leads to considerable O 3 loss and reduction of its lifetime. Our observation-constrained modeling analysis suggests that oxidation of VOCs (especially aromatics) and heterogeneous reactions (e. g. HONO formation and aerosol uptake HO 2) play potentially critical roles in the primary radical budget and O 3 formation in Beijing. One important ramification is that O 3 production is neither NO x nor VOC limited, but in a transition regime where reduction of either NO x or VOCs could result in reduction of O 3 production. The transition regime implies more flexibility in the O 3 control strategies than a binary system of either NO x or VOC limited regime. The co-benefit of concurrent reduction of both NO x and VOCs in reducing column O 3 production integrated in the planetary boundary layer is significant. Further research on the spatial extent of the transition regime over the polluted eastern China is critically important for controlling regional O 3 pollution...|$|E

40|$|Virtually all close compact {{binary stars}} are formed through common {{envelope}} (CE) evolution.

Our data indicate that large volumes of aragonite and magnesian calcite ar being exported along the open-ocean margin of Little Bahama Bank during the present high-stand of sea-level. Percentages of mud-size aragonite+magnesian calcite display a strong negative correlation (r =- 0. 912) with distance from the dge of the bank, whereas percentages of calcite show a strong positive correlation (+ 0. 914). Immediately adjacent to the northern, windward margin of Little Bahama Bank, 86 ~ of the fine-grained carbonates are bank-derived. This value decreases in a linear fashion to 50 ~ bank-derived muds at a distance of 50 km from Little Bahama Bank.

40|$|Aircraft and {{satellite}} observations {{indicate the presence}} of ppt (ppt ≡ pmol/mol) levels of BrO in the free troposphere with important <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tropospheric <b>budgets</b> of ozone, OH, and mercury. We can reproduce these observations with the GEOS-Chem global tropospheric chemistry model by including a broader consideration of multiphase halogen (Br–Cl) chemistry than {{has been done in}} the past. Important reactions for regenerating BrO from its non-radical reservoirs include HOBr+Br−/Cl− in both aerosols and clouds, and oxidation of Br− by ClNO 3 and ozone. Most tropospheric BrO in the model is in the free troposphere, consistent with observations, and originates mainly from the photolysis and oxidation of ocean-emitted CHBr 3. Stratospheric input is also important in the upper troposphere. Including production of gas phase inorganic bromine from debromination of acidified sea salt aerosol increases free tropospheric Bry by about 30 %. We find HOBr to be the dominant gas-phase reservoir of inorganic bromine. Halogen (Br-Cl) radical chemistry as implemented here in GEOS-Chem drives 14 % and 11 % decreases in the global burdens of tropospheric ozone and OH, respectively, a 16 % increase in the atmospheric lifetime of methane, and an atmospheric lifetime of 6 months <b>for</b> elemental mercury. <b>The</b> dominant mechanism <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Br-Cl driven tropospheric ozone decrease is oxidation of NOx by formation and hydrolysis of BrNO 3 and ClNO 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{user cost}} {{elasticity}} is a parameter of considerable importance in economics, with <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> effects of <b>budget</b> deficits, tax-based savings incentives, monetary policy, corporate taxes, and tariffs and quotas on capital goods. This paper analyzes the econometric issues that account <b>for</b> differences in <b>the</b> estimated elasticity {{between the two}} existing papers that estimate the long-run elasticity on aggregate data. The preferred estimate that results from this analysis is substantially higher than most previous estimates. The empirical evidence suggests that, when adjustment frictions are important, long-run estimates of key parameters are less biased – and {{the details of the}} econometrics matter. In particular, DOLS estimates appear less biased than the alternatives considered here.

40|$|Analyzing how {{climate change}} affects {{vegetation}} distribution {{is one of}} the central issues of global change ecology as this has important <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> carbon <b>budget</b> of terrestrial vegetation. Mapping vegetation distribution under historical climate scenarios is essential <b>for</b> understanding <b>the</b> response of vegetation distribution to future climatic changes. The reconstructions of palaeovegetation based on pollen data provide a useful method to understand the relationship between climate and vegetation distribution. However, this method is limited in time and space. Here, using species distribution model (SDM) approaches, we explored the climatic determinants of contemporary vegetation distribution and reconstructed the distribution of Chinese vegetation during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 18, 000 14 C yr BP) and Middle-Holocene (MH, 6000 14 C yr BP). The dynamics of vegetation distribution since the LGM reconstructed by SDMs were largely consistent with those based on pollen data, suggesting that the SDM approach is a useful tool for studying historical vegetation dynamics and its response to climate change across time and space. Comparison between the modeled contemporary potential natural vegetation distribution and the observed contemporary distribution suggests that temperate deciduous forests, subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests, temperate deciduous shrublands and temperate steppe have low range fillings and are strongly influenced by human activities. In general, the Tibetan Plateau, North and Northeast China, and the areas near the 30 °N in Central and Southeast China appeared to have experienced the highest turnover in vegetation due to climate change from the LGM to the present...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{implications}} of a recent discovery (Jenkins 2009) that atomic oxygen is being depleted from diffuse interstellar gas {{at a rate that}} cannot be accounted for by its presence in silicate and metallic oxide particles. To place this discovery in context, the uptake of elemental O into dust is considered over a wide range of environments, from the tenuous intercloud gas and diffuse clouds sampled by the depletion observations to dense clouds where ice mantles and gaseous CO become important reservoirs of O. The distribution of O in these contrasting regions is quantified in terms of a common parameter, the mean number density of hydrogen. At the interface between diffuse and dense phases (just before the onset of ice mantle growth) as much as 160 ppm of the O abundance is unaccounted for. If this reservoir of depleted oxygen persists to higher densities it has <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> oxygen <b>budget</b> in molecular clouds, where a shortfall of the same order is observed. Of various potential carriers, the most plausible appears to be a form of O-bearing carbonaceous matter similar to the organics found in cometary particles returned by the Stardust mission. The "organic refractory" model for interstellar dust is re-examined in the light of these findings, and it is concluded that further observations and laboratory work are needed to determine whether this class of material is present in quantities sufficient to account for a significant fraction of the unidentified depleted oxygen...|$|R

These observations provide much-needed constraints on models of the habitability zone and the atmospheres of possible terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarf hosts, and will be useful in refining <b>the</b> target selection <b>for</b> future space missions such as TPF. We compare our data with a new generation of M dwarf atmospheric models and discuss their <b>implication</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> chromospheric energy <b>budget.</b> These NUV data will also be valuable in conjunction with existing optical, FUV and X-ray data to explore unanswered questions regarding the dynamo generation and magnetic heating in low-mass stars...|$|R
40|$|Shelf break {{systems are}} highly dynamic environments. However {{little is known}} about the {{influence}} that benthic interactions and water mass mixing may have on vertical distributions of iron in these systems. Dissolved Fe (< 0. 4 ?m) concentrations were measured in samples from nine vertical profiles across the upper slope (150 – 2950 m water depth) at the Atlantic Ocean–Celtic Sea shelf break. Dissolved iron concentrations varied between less than 0. 2 and 5. 4 nM, and the resulting detailed section showed evidence of a range of processes influencing the Fe distributions. The near sea floor data were interpreted in terms of release and removal processes. The concentrations of dissolved Fe present in near seabed waters were consistent with release of Fe from in situ remineralisation of particulate organic matter at two upper slope stations, and possibly release from pore water upon resuspension on shelf. Lateral transport of dissolved iron was evident from elevated Fe concentrations in an intermediate nepheloid layer and its advection along isopycnals. Surface waters at the shelf break also showed evidence of vertical mixing of deeper iron-rich waters. These waters contained macronutrients that sustained primary productivity in these otherwise nutrient-depleted surface waters. The data also suggest some degree of stabilisation of relatively high concentrations of iron, presumably through ligand association or as colloids. This study supports the view that lateral export of dissolved iron to the interior of the ocean from shelf and coastal zones and may have important <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> global <b>budget</b> of oceanic iron...|$|R
