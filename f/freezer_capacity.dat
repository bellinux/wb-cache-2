5000|$|Total Logistic Control is {{a supply}} chain company started around 1902 by George K. Taylor. The company began as a {{regional}} distributor of frozen products known as Taylor Cold Storage. They operated frozen warehouse operations for other regional food companies in Great Lakes region. Around 1930, they merged with Wisconsin Cold Storage. In 1958, Taylor became the first public refrigerated warehouse to offer consolidated LTL distribution to its customers. In the 1960s, their total <b>freezer</b> <b>capacity</b> hit [...] Taylor introduced TINMAN, the Total INformation MANagement system, in 1976, becoming the first firm in the industry to offer on-line inventory management.|$|E
50|$|When {{using an}} ULT <b>freezer</b> at full <b>capacity,</b> 40,000 or 50,000 microtubes {{are stored in}} one instrument. Clear sample {{labeling}} (type of sample, concentration, volume, owner, date, etc.) and exact documentation of the sample location within the freezer is mandatory to find the sample tubes.|$|R
50|$|JP Foodservice Distributors {{passed the}} $1 billion mark {{in its first}} year, with sales for fiscal 1990 of $1.02 billion. That was a jump of more than 12 percent from the division's sales in fiscal 1989, and made the new company number five among the top 50 {{distributors}} selected by Institutional Distributor. But Miller and the other managers had borrowed over 95 percent of the $317 million they paid for the company. With that amount of debt, and with a soft economy, JP concentrated on building the lowest cost structure in the industry. The company invested primarily in improving facilities, adding a new $15 million replacement center between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore and building an addition at its Allentown, Pennsylvania warehouse that doubled <b>freezer</b> and cooler <b>capacity.</b> It also used technology {{to cut costs and}} provide greater service to its customers. For example, a hand-held electronic device allowed JP customers to monitor their inventory and send information to the company.|$|R
40|$|Beaufort Fisheries Incorporated, a {{manufacturer}} of traditional menhaden fish products (meal, oil, solubles), is currently diversifying its product line into other seafood areas. The acquisition and installation of a spiral <b>freezer</b> with a <b>capacity</b> of processing in excess of 6000 lbs/hr and a freezer with storage of more than 1, 000, 000 lbs of finished product are major steps in this endeavor. This project is a feasibility study for reduction of waste load and water use in current processing operations: it also explores future business uses for the new processing/freezer facility. The plant was initially surveyed to identify sources of solids loss as well as water use patterns. Methods were suggested to reduce or recover and reuse process water and solids from the plant. A conceptual design was proposed for the recovery system and integrated into the existing meal and oil operations. Costs and payback for the pollution prevention system were evaluated. Waste streams from a whole frozen fish factory are primarily associated with washing of whole fish prior to sorting and inspection operations. Considerabl...|$|R
50|$|For the new store (as {{with the}} Glaspaleis) {{inspiration}} was sought throughout Europe, including {{visits to the}} US and Sweden (especially the redevelopment of the Stockholm city centre {{and its effect on}} shopping was a good example because it was better adapted to the European situation). The new store wasn't just much bigger, but featured an extended assortment, a selection one would expect of a modern warehouse store. Clothing, Schunck's mainstay, was still dominant on floors 1 (children), 2 (ladies) and 3 (gents) (with 47 fitting rooms). In the Glaspaleis, customers were welcome to {{have a cup of coffee}} at the penthouse (serviced by the family themselves), but now this was professionalised to a complete lunchroom for 180 people at the fourth floor. The other half of that floor featured toys and interior furnishings, also something that was already present at the Glaspaleis. Offices and the canteen were on the top floor. The new sections, however, were located at the two lowest floors. The ground floor featured merchandise like stationery (and many pocket books), perfume and suitcases and a patisserie with its own bakery (all self-service, except for the bonbons, which had to be weighed). The souterrain housed a 2600 mÂ² supermarket, with 7000 items on sale and an assortment ranging from Russian caviar to 70 types of cheese. Extra efficiency was achieved at the seven checkout counters by using two trolleys (and no conveyor belt). A cashier would move the items from one trolley to the other and the customer could then take that to one of the 53 'packaging tables' (with assistance for those who desired it), thus reducing waiting time at the counter. The region is known for its high demand for quality meat. The butchery in the supermarket had a total counter length of 45 m, and a <b>freezer</b> with a <b>capacity</b> of 10.000 kg of meat. This and the other cooled storage rooms (e.g., for fruit and dairy products) were serviced by a monorail, suspended from the ceiling. This, combined with automated weighing and packaging machines (with a capacity of 10,000 packages of meat per day and shrink-wrap for fruit) meant that the food did not need to be touched by human hands, which had its advantages for hygiene. Nevertheless, there were constantly 7 butchers at work.|$|R
