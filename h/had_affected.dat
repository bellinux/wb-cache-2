5|$|By the 1980s, {{planning}} blight <b>had</b> <b>affected</b> {{the area}} {{and many of the}} houses had become home to a community of artists and squatters. Eventually, contractors were appointed to carry out the work and a compulsory purchase of property along the proposed route was undertaken. In March 1993, in preparation for the construction of the road, the Earl of Caithness, then the Minister of State for Transport, estimated that there would be 263 properties scheduled for demolition, displacing 550 people, of which he estimated 172 were seeking rehousing. Several original residents, who had in some cases lived in their homes all their lives, refused to sell or move out of their properties.|$|E

Shipments of food from the mainland—which accounted for up to 90% of Hawaii's needs—had been curtailed as a coastwise strike <b>had</b> <b>affected</b> all ports except Los Angeles.

5|$|Around this time, and {{particularly}} after the fourth Test defeat, critics suggested that Walter Robins, {{one of the}} selectors, should captain England to bring a more attacking approach to the job. However, Robins' age counted against him; the selectors were satisfied with Yardley's captaincy in what were difficult circumstances, and retained him for the final Test. In that match, he failed twice with the bat, scoring 7 and 9 as England were humiliated, bowled out for 52 and 188 to lose by an innings. England lost the series 4–0. Yardley managed 150 runs {{at an average of}} 16.66, not passing fifty in a single innings. However, he once again topped the England bowling averages, taking nine wickets at an average of 22.66. Bowes believed that the pressure of captaincy <b>had</b> <b>affected</b> Yardley's batting. Bowes also cast doubt on Yardley's future, stating that other commitments may have prevented his continuing to play cricket much longer.|$|E
5|$|Before Eline struck Mozambique, storm {{warnings}} and later hurricane warnings were issued on February21. Flooding <b>had</b> <b>affected</b> the nation since January, with some areas receiving a year's worth of rainfall in two weeks. Widespread areas were inundated, with about 220,000people displaced, and about 150people killed. Eline moved ashore with very powerful winds, {{although there were}} no direct observations of the strongest winds. In Beira, the closest major city to the landfall point, winds reached storm force. However, the rainfall from Eline was the most impacting following the preexisting flooding, which were the worst since 1951. The floods were beginning to recede by the time Eline arrived, {{and by the end}} of February 2000, the situation was considered the country's worst natural disaster in a century. Flooding continued for days after Eline moved through southern Africa due to waters flowing downstream from neighboring countries. By early March the floods were beginning to recede again, leaving behind a deep layer of mud, ponds of contaminated water, and piles of rotten corpses.|$|E
5|$|For {{several days}} while {{offshore}} western Madagascar, Haruna dropped greater than normal rainfall. The storm ultimately made landfall about 15hours faster than anticipated. Winds and rainfall from Haruna damaged houses and power systems, and also damaged 265classrooms and 16health facilities. There was also {{damage to the}} rice and maize crops from high winds near the coast, causing food shortages. Rains from the storm caused a dyke along the Fiherenana River to break, which flooded a large region and forced about 6,000people to evacuate their homes. The flooding from the dyke break was worst in Toliara, where most residents lost access to fresh water and power. Flooding in the city caused the temporarily closure of the airport there. The town of Morombe was temporarily isolated after the road was blocked. Power outages affected Morombe, Toliara, Sakaraha, and Betioky Sud. Downed trees <b>had</b> <b>affected</b> roads near Toliara but were quickly removed. About 1,050houses were flooded, another 691 lost their roofs, and 7,402 were destroyed, leaving 13,882people homeless. Overall, Haruna killed 26people and injured another 127.|$|E

5|$|For the 1955–56 season, Plante was the unchallenged {{starting}} goaltender of the Canadiens; Gerry McNeil had {{not played}} the previous season {{and was sent}} to the Montreal Royals. Charlie Hodge, Plante's backup the previous season, was sent to a Canadiens' farm team in Seattle. Later that season, Montreal won the Stanley Cup—the first of what would be five consecutive Stanley Cup championship seasons. The next season, Plante missed most of November because of chronic bronchitis, a consequence of the asthma that <b>had</b> <b>affected</b> him since childhood. During the 1957–58 NHL season, the Canadiens won their third straight Stanley Cup despite injuries to Plante {{and other members of the}} team. Plante's asthma was getting worse. He sustained a concussion with just a few weeks left in the season and missed three games of the playoffs. In the sixth game of the Stanley Cup finals, Plante's asthma was making him dizzy, and he was having difficulty concentrating; he collapsed at the end of the game after teammate Doug Harvey scored the series-winning goal. The Canadiens went on to win the Stanley Cup again at the close of the 1958–59 season.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} time in nearly two decades that number 1 played number 2 and neither had won the French Open previously. Andy Murray had a career {{resurgence}} on clay, making deep runs in the Masters tournaments prior to the French Open, finishing runner up to Djokovic in Madrid before besting him in Rome. Rain <b>had</b> <b>affected</b> the tournament schedule and in Djokovic's case, he had to play 4 matches in 5 days. Murray was playing to become the first Brit since 1937 to win, while Djokovic had multiple historical records on the line, most notably joining the elite group of men who won a career grand slam and joining Rod Laver and Don Budge as the only men to hold all 4 Grand Slam titles at the same time. After Murray took the first set, Djokovic rallied to win the match prevailing in four sets.|$|E
5|$|Mortality under captivity is {{generally}} high; reasons include stillbirths, birth defects, cannibalism, hypothermia, neglect of cubs by mothers, and infectious diseases. A study comparing {{the health of}} captive and wild cheetahs noted that despite having similar genetic make-up, wild cheetahs are far healthier than their captive counterparts. The study identified possible stress factors such as restricted habitat and interaction with human beings and other carnivores, and recommended private and spacious areas for captive cheetahs. A study of diseases suffered by captive cheetahs in the period 1989–92 in several North American zoos showed that hepatic veno-occlusive disease, a disease of the liver, <b>had</b> <b>affected</b> 82% of the deceased cheetahs, caused nine deaths, and occurred in 51% of living females. Chronic gastritis was detected in 91% of the population. Glomerulosclerosis, a disease of the kidneys, emerged as another significant disease, affecting 84% of the cheetahs; another renal disease, nephrosclerosis, affected 39% of the cheetahs. Feline infectious peritonitis caused two deaths. Pneumonia was a major cause for juvenile deaths. Another study concluded that excess of vitaminA in their diets could result in veno-occlusive disease in their livers.|$|E

HBO will hold first-run rights to all newer episodes of the series, after which they will air on PBS member stations following a nine-month exclusivity window, with no charge to the stations for airing the content. The agreement also gives HBO exclusive rights to stream past and future Sesame Street episodes on HBO Go and HBO Now – assuming those rights from Amazon Video and Netflix; on August 14, Sesame Workshop announced that it would phase out its in-house subscription streaming service, Sesame Go, as a standalone service; the service will remain in operation, likely with its offerings reduced to a slate content available for free or serving as a portal for Sesame Streets website. The deal came in the wake of cutbacks that <b>had</b> <b>affected</b> the series in recent years, the changing viewer habits of American children in the previous ten years, and Sesame Workshop's dependence upon revenue from DVD sales.|$|E
