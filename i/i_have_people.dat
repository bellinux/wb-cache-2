500|$|As Travolta did {{not attend}} to collect his trophies, an action figure of Terl, his character, {{accepted}} them in his place. Travolta responded a week later to the awards: [...] "I didn't even know there were such awards. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> around me {{whose job it is}} to not tell me about such things. They're obviously doing their job. Not every film can be a critical and box office success. It would have been awful only if Battlefield Earth was neither. That's not the case. It is edging toward the $100m mark which means it has found an audience even if it didn't impress critics. I'd rather my films connect with audiences than with critics because it gives you more longevity as a performer." [...] He later insisted that he still felt [...] "really good about it. Here I was taking big chances, breaking a new genre." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2015, Nina made {{a special}} {{appearance}} on the 20th-year anniversary of variety show ASAP where her performance of [...] "Vision of Love" [...] with fellow singers Juris and Kyla became a trending topic in social media. After {{taking a break from}} showbiz, Nina announced that she gave birth to a baby girl, Ysabella Louise, on December 24, 2015 after an eight-year relationship with her husband Coy Enriquez. She labored for 13 hours and decided to give a painful birth, without anaesthesia, to feel the sacrifices of being a mother. In an interview with Philippine Entertainment Portal, she expressed choosing to keep her personal life private, stating [...] "I chose to be quiet and just go on with my life normally. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> in my life who are also into their privacy. [...] which is totally different to theirs." [...] She added that she is not hooked in social media and she often just post pictures to promote her shows. On June 14, 2016, she was featured on the debut single of R duo Joshua Desiderio and Lloyd Zaragoza (JO.LLO), entitled [...] "Ikaw ang Bida." [...] On June 19, 2017, Nina made an appearance on Wish 107.5 radio station's [...] "Charlie Puth Special" [...] where she performed [...] "Attention" [...] and her hit single [...] "Jealous" [...] during the Wish Bus roadshow. The event was organized by the radio station in collaboration with Warner Music, her original record label. She announced returning to Warner for release of her eighth studio album. Nina had her acting debut for the indie film DAD: Durugin ang Droga, which is an advocacy film promoting awareness on drug addiction. The film was directed by Dinky Doo J. Clarion, supposedly for the 2017 Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino, and was released in September 2017.|$|E

"Happily, Jeanne," [...] Harry replied coolly, [...] "your dying {{would in}} no respect benefit him; and as {{your life is}} in my eyes of a {{thousand}} times more consequence {{than that of the}} king, and as your chances of safety to some extent depend upon mine, I do not mean to risk one of those chances {{for the sake of his}} majesty. Besides, to tell you the truth, I have a good deal of liking for my own life, and have a marked objection to losing my head.

60|$|On Thursday <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> {{to see and}} {{matters to}} attend to, both {{at the office and}} at Coutts', which, in Wills's absence, I cannot forego or depute to another. But, between ourselves, I must add {{something}} else: I have the greatest objection to attend a funeral in which my affections are not strongly and immediately concerned. I have no notion of a funeral as a matter of form or ceremony. And just as I should expressly prohibit the summoning to my own burial of anybody who was not very near or dear to me, so I revolt from myself appearing at that solemn rite unless the deceased were very near or dear to me. I cannot endure being dressed up by an undertaker as part of his trade show. I was not in this poor good fellow's house in his lifetime, and I feel that I have no business there when he lies dead in it. My mind is penetrated with sympathy and compassion for the young widow, but that feeling is a real thing, and my attendance as a mourner would not be--to myself. It would be to you, I know, but it would not be to myself. I know full well that you cannot delegate to me your memories of and your associations with the deceased, and the more true and tender they are the more invincible is my objection to become a form {{in the midst of the}} most awful realities.|$|E
2500|$|O'Connor {{received}} some criticism for having his fifth child (Adam) later in life. Of this he said, [...] "Happily, though, I'm not experiencing {{that at the}} moment. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>people</b> saying <b>I</b> was selfish. But what's selfish about that? How can you say to a woman you've been with for 15-odd years, 'No, I've got four and we're not having any more?'. That would be selfish." ...|$|R

6000|$|The reader may not improbably hear it said, {{by persons}} who are {{incapable}} of maintaining an honest argument, and therefore incapable of understanding or believing the honesty of an adversary, that I have caricatured, or unfairly chosen, the examples I give of the masters I depreciate. It is evident, in the first place, that I could not, if I were even cunningly disposed, adopt a worse policy than in so doing; for the discovery of caricature or falsity in my representations, would not only invalidate the immediate statement, but the whole book; and invalidate it in the most fatal way, by showing that all I had ever said about [...] "truth" [...] was hypocrisy, and that in my own affairs I expected to prevail by help of lies. Nevertheless it necessarily happens, that in endeavors to facsimile any work whatsoever, bad or good, some changes are induced from the exact aspect of the original. These changes are, of course, sometimes harmful, sometimes advantageous; the bad thing generally gains; the good thing always loses: so that I am continually tormented by finding, in my plates of contrasts, the virtue and vice I exactly wanted to talk about, eliminated from both examples. In some cases, however, the bad thing will lose also, and then I must either cancel the plate, or increase {{the cost of the}} work by preparing another (at a similar risk), or run the chance of incurring the charge of dishonest representation. I desire, therefore, very earnestly, and once for all, to have it understood that whatever I say in the text, bearing on questions of comparison, refers always to the original works; and that, if the reader has it in his power, I would far rather he should look at those works than at my plates of them; I only give the plates for his immediate help and convenience: and I mention this, with respect to my plate of Claude's ramification, because, if I have {{such a thing as a}} prejudice at all, (and, although I do not myself think <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> <b>people</b> certainly say so,) it is against Claude; and I might, therefore, be sooner suspected of some malice in this plate than in others. But I simply gave the original engravings from the Liber Veritatis to Mr. Le Keux, earnestly requesting that the portions selected might be faithfully copied; and I think he is much to be thanked for so carefully and successfully accomplishing the task.

Baxter said: [...] "I always got the impression from Michael Lloyd that... there was a separate agenda {{that we were not}} privy to....
