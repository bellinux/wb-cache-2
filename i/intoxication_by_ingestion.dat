40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} way of {{incorporating}} fuzzy temporal reasoning within diagnostic reasoning. Disorders are described as an evolving set of necessary and possible manifestations. Fuzzy intervals are used to model ill-known moments in time (e. g. {{the beginning and end}} of a manifestation) and intensity of manifestations (e. g. "high" fever). The paper discusses several measures of consistency between a disorder model and the patient data, and defines when the manifestations presented by the patient can be explained by a disorder. 1 Introduction Temporal information and temporal reasoning are important aspects of diagnostic reasoning [9, 8, 2, 13], specially in some domains, such as, for example, the diagnostics of infectious diseases.

40|$|Botulism is a {{foodborne}} <b>intoxication</b> caused <b>by</b> <b>ingestion</b> of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT). Preliminary studies focussed on {{the production}} of polyclonal antisera against BoNT/E by immunizing a rabbit with botulinal toxoid type E. The antiserum was subsequently used to detect BoNT/E using the slot blot immunoassay where samples were applied to a slot blot filtration manifold and drawn by vacuum through a membrane. The membrane was then immunologically processed before chemiluminescent detection. However, the antisera lacked specificity and cross-reacted with closely related clostridia strains. The specificity of the antisera was increased by adsorbing cross-reactive antibodies from whole antisera with affinity columns made with total proteins from culture supernatants of closely related clostridia. Alternatively, specific antibodies were isolated with an affinity column prepared with C. botulinum type E toxoid. Different methods of concentrating BoNT/E in each sample prior to testing them were evaluated to increase {{the sensitivity of the}} assay. The slot blot immunoassay was then evaluated for detection of BoNT/E in mixed cultures and in food samples. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: This article {{describes}} the retrospective analysis of the patients who presented with a drug-related intoxication to the emergency department of the Erasmus Medical Centre in 2000. METHODS: Data were collected from the emergency department's electronic database and the medical charts of the patients. RESULTS: A total of 243 patients were seen with a drug-related <b>intoxication</b> caused <b>by</b> <b>ingestion</b> {{of one or more}} medical substances, drugs of abuse (DOA) or combinations with alcohol. Mono-intoxication occurred in 58 % of the patients, predominantly caused by DOA (56 patients), analgesics (17 patients) or benzodiazepines (14 patients). Benzodiazepines (55 patients), analgesics (42 patients), alcohol (42 patients), DOA (40 patients) and antidepressants (23 patients) were predominant in combined intoxications. More than half of the patients (142) were discharged after being treated in the emergency department and 80 patients were admitted to the wards. Eighteen patients were admitted elsewhere and three patients were lost to follow-up. Eventually, 70 patients were discharged after having been admitted, five patients were admitted to other institutions, two patients died and three patients were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: DOA, benzodiazepines, analgesics, alcohol and antidepressants accounted for approximately 65 % of the drug-related intoxications in 2000 and in a third of the presenting patients, toxicity was such that admission to the wards was warranted...|$|R

Beside the herd clinical case, the authors present some considerations about the spreading of bracken fern in Parana, with particular interest in the environmental conditions (including weather). We suspect that these conditions can facilitate the spread of the plant during the cold months of the year. More plant available means a favorable situation for the bracken fern animal consumption, then causing losses to the cattle industry.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} aimed {{to analyze the}} {{scavenging}} effect of haemoperfusion on plasma paraquat (PQ) and to evaluate the clinical significance of PQ examination {{in the treatment of}} patients with acute paraquat poisoning. Methods: 85 patients with acute paraquat <b>intoxication</b> <b>by</b> oral <b>ingestion</b> were admitted in West China Hospital from Jun, 2010 to Mar, 2011. A standardized therapeutic regimen including emergency haemoperfusion was given on all subjects. A total of 91 whole blood samples were taken before (0 h), underway (1 h after haemoperfusion beginning) and at the end (2 h) of the haemoperfusion therapy. The clearance rate was calculated and related factors were analyzed. Results: As heamoperfusion was going on, the plasma paraquat concentration of the patients kept falling down. After 1 hour of haemoperfusion, the average clearance rate (R 1) was 37. 06621. 81 %. After 2 hours of haemoperfusion, the average clearance rate (R 2) was 45. 99623. 13 %. The average of R 1 /R 2 ratio was 76. 61622. 80 %. In the high paraquat concentration group (plasma paraquat concentration (C 0). 300 ng/mL), both the averages of R 1 and R 2 were significantly higher than those of the low paraquat concentration group (C 0 # 200 ng/mL) (p, 0. 05), and {{there was no significant difference}} of R 1 /R 2 between these two groups (p. 0. 05). Conclusions: The dynamic monitoring of plasma PQ concentration was not only critical in the clinical evaluation but also helpful in guiding the treatment of patients with acute PQ intoxication.

40|$|International audienceCiguatera fish {{poisoning}} (CFP) {{is a human}} foodborne <b>intoxication</b> caused <b>by</b> <b>ingestion</b> {{of tropical}} fishes contaminated with the potent polyether toxins known as ciguatoxins (CTXs). These toxins are issued from Gambierdiscus species of dinoflagellates. Herbivorous fish accumulate these toxins in their musculature and viscera after ingesting dinoflagellates. Epidemiological studies showed that CFP has been present in areas between 35 degrees North and 35 degrees South latitude, mainly, Indo-pacific and Caribbean areas, but not in waters closed to European and African continent. In the present paper, a specimen of Seriola dumerili weighing 70 kg and a smaller Seriola fasciata specimen, captured in waters belonging to Selvagens Islands (Madeira Arquipelago), were analyzed. Fishes from this genus were implicated in previous suspected ciguatera poisoning outbreaks in the Portuguese Madeira Arquipelago in the North Atlantic Ocean. Analysis was performed by two approaches, a functional method using cerebellar granule cells and by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) method. The study {{was carried out in}} one portion of the tail muscle of Seriola fasciata and five parts of the body of Seriola dumerili (tail muscle, head, ventral muscle, mid muscle, and liver). The functional method consisted in the modification of the inward sodium current in cerebellar granule cells and the chemical method was a high resolution chromatography, which allowed elucidating the toxin profile in the samples. In addition, UPLC-MS technique was optimized and used for detecting and quantifying CTXs for the first time. After fish extraction and clean up, the chromatograms revealed the presence of CTX- 1 B at 1111. 6 m/z, CTX- 3 C at 1023. 5 m/z, a CTX analogue at 1040. 6 m/z, and a CTX from the Caribbean or Indic waters at 1141. 6 m/z. Therefore, the results obtained in the present paper for both methods confirm, for the first time, the presence of CTX in fish from Madeira Arquipelago...|$|R

Ostreopsis species grow well in shallow waters as epiphyte, mainly embedded in a self-produced mucilage sheath covering macroalgae, corals or rocks. In tropical seas, Ostreopsis has been related to human <b>intoxication</b> -sometimes fatal- <b>by</b> <b>ingestion</b> of contaminated marine food. The data collected along the last 20 years indicate the potential expansion of this toxic organism in temperate waters, including the Mediterranean, as a result of climate warming and anthropogenic impacts in the coastal zone.

40|$|At present, in many European {{countries}} {{people is}} looking for wild edible plants to experience new tastes and flavors, by following the new trend of being green and environmentally friendly (1). Borago officinalis L. (borage) is an annual herb originating in the Mediterranean region but naturalized and widely cultivated throughout most of Europe, traditionally used for culinary and medicinal purposes. Its leaves are mixed in salads and used as a vegetable in different European countries, such as Germany, Spain, Greece, and Italy (2), especially in Liguria as a stuff of traditional ravioli and pansoti (3). However, young borage leaves can be easily confused by inexpert pickers {{with those of other}} plants, including poisonous ones, such as Mandragora autumnalis (mandrake), common in Southern Italy and Sicily, or Digitalis purpurea (foxglove), in Northern Italy. Patients who turn to Italian Poison Control Centers or Hospital Emergency Rooms after accidental ingestion of these plants, show anticholinergic symptoms due to unintentional ingestion of the leaves of mandrake (most commonly) or foxglove (less frequently). In the period 1995 - 2007, 50 cases of <b>intoxication</b> <b>by</b> accidental <b>ingestion</b> of mandrake and 6 cases after ingestion of foxglove have been reported in Italy (1). In the present work we show the pharmacognostic characterization of young leaves from B. officinalis (Boraginaceae), M. autumnalis (Solanaceae), and D. purpurea (Scrophulariaceae). Micromorphological, phytochemical and molecular identification techniques were used. Fresh leaf samples were analyzed by optical and scanning electron microscopy, highlighting main anatomical and histological features, such as stomata and trichome types and distribution (Fig 1, A-C). DNA barcoding sequences (using a region of the plastidial RbcL as DNA marker), analyzed using a bioinformatics tool (MEGA v. 7. 0), allowed to determine the intra- and inter-genetic variability (K 2 P distance) among the three taxa.

40|$|AbstractNatural <b>intoxication</b> of {{livestock}} <b>by</b> <b>ingestion</b> of Ipomoea asarifolia leaves {{has been reported}} to occur widely in Brazil. Previous studies carried out by our research group provided strong evidence that a lectin could be involved with the toxic properties of I. asarifolia. To reinforce this hypothesis, a lectin-enriched fraction (LEF) was isolated from I. asarifolia leaves and its toxic effects were assessed. Leaves of I. asarifolia were excised from plants growing widely in the field, mechanically wounded and maintained in a chamber at 25 ± 3 °C for 72 h in the dark, under near 100 % relative humidity. The leaf proteins were extracted, ammonium sulfate precipitated, chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose and Phenyl-Sepharose to produce LEF that under SDS–PAGE showed a molecular mass of 44. 0 kDa and after N-terminal amino acid analysis a primary sequence composed of AGYTPVLDIGAEVLAAGEPY. The in vivo toxicity of LEF assessed by intraorbital injection in mice showed induced severe uncoordinated movements without death. LEF reduced the muscular contraction in a dose depend way and at 29. 8 μg/mL (CE 50) it produces 50 % inhibition of contraction, suggesting that LEF blunts autonomic neurotransmission. Isolated rat kidneys were perfused with LEF and no effects on the perfusion pressure or renal vascular resistance were observed, but urinary flow and glomerular filtration rate increased. Moreover, the percentage of tubular transport of Na+, K+ and Cl− decreased. Histological examination of the kidneys perfused with LEF exhibited little alterations. These toxic effects observed above were concomitant with the increase of LEF hemagglutination activity, which strongly suggest that one of the toxic principles of I. asarifolia is a lectin present in its leaves...|$|R
40|$|The National Poisons Information Centre (NVIC) of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) was {{consulted}} in 2004 {{more frequently}} about acute intoxications than in 2003, representing {{an increase of}} about 6 %. In 2004, over 35, 000 enquiries were received about more than 47, 000 different exposures to chemical substances. The NVIC is specialized in providing quick and adequate information on possible effects and treatment of patients exposed to chemical substances. Physicians and other relief workers, such as {{the police and the}} fire brigade, can consult with the NVIC by telephone, 24 hours a day. This 24 -hour availability is important in case of calamities or terrorist attacks. In 2004, the NVIC was consulted for close to 26, 000 cases of medication overdose, of which a considerable number were due to overdoses of sleep-inducing drugs or painkillers. Particularly the number of consultations on overdoses where over-the-counter medications were ingested increased greatly; these included such painkillers as ibuprofen and diclofenac. Percentagewise, the largest increase among adults, compared to 2003, was seen for quetiapine, an antipsychotic drug (73 %). Despite the NVIC's focus in 2004 on overdoses of multivitamins among children, the number of consultations on multivitamins increased by 19 % compared to 2003. Over 3, 300 consultations concerned exposure of young children to household products. Especially noteworthy were the increases of 76 % and 32 % for the number of exposures to air fresheners and lamp oil, respectively. These products may be coloured, which makes them look like lemonade, and attractive to children, who mistakenly, take a few sips.

Because of the possible health risks associated with sodium percarbonate, the NVIC broadened its investigations to include a study on the clinical course of <b>intoxications</b> caused <b>by</b> <b>ingestion</b> of these cleaning products. Results showed limited health risks when products containing less than 10 % sodium percarbonate were ingested; patients {{did not need to be}} hospitalized.
