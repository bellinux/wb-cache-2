Asbestos-bodies were detected histologically in all 33 patients with serial paraffin sections, and these bodies usually appeared in areas adjacent to the brochiolo-alveolar walls, alveolar macrophages as well as the fibroblasts in the peribrochiolar areas. Lymphocytic infiltrations were seen in 28. 9 % of the specimens. Most of these reactions were not remarkable. More than half of the specimens showed perivascular fibrosis (61. 4 %) and fibrous thickening of the pleural and subpleural portions with various degrees of mesothelial hyperplasia (97. 1 %), and an accumulation of <b>dust</b> <b>cells.</b> However, the asbestos-body was rarely seen in these fibrousareas as opposed to the bronchiolo-alveolar lumen and wall.

40|$|We {{present an}} updated version of SKIRT, a 3 D Monte Carlo {{radiative}} transfer code developed to simulate dusty galaxies. The main novel characteristics of the SKIRT code are the use of a stellar foam to generate random positions, an efficient combination of eternal forced scattering and continuous absorption, and a new library approach that links the radiative transfer code to the DustEM dust emission library. This approach enables a fast, accurate and self-consistent calculation of the dust emission of arbitrary mixtures of transiently heated dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, even for full 3 D models containing millions of <b>dust</b> <b>cells.</b> We have demonstrated the accuracy of the SKIRT code through a set of simulations based on the edge-on spiral galaxy UGC 4754. The models we ran were gradually refined from a smooth, 2 D, LTE model to a fully 3 D model that includes NLTE dust emission and a clumpy structure of the dusty ISM. We find that clumpy models absorb UV and optical radiation less efficiently than smooth models with the same amount of dust, and that the dust in clumpy models is on average both cooler and less luminous.

Also, the effects of grain dust, which also causes a form of airway obstruction, were studied. The epithelial injury was assessed by measuring 51 Cr release from cells as an indication of lysis, and by monitoring cells which had detached from the substratum. No significant injury to A 549 cells was caused by culture with any of the dusts collected from the air but surface "ledge" dust caused significant lysis at some doses. Quartz, used as a toxic control dust, caused significant lysis at the highest concentration of 100 micrograms/well. To determine whether any injurious material was soluble the dusts were incubated in saline and extracts collected. No extracts caused significant injury to epithelial cells. A similar lack of toxicity was found when 51 Cr labelled control alveolar macrophages were targets for injury. Significant release of radiolabel was evident when macrophages were exposed to quartz at concentrations of 10 and 20 micrograms/well, there being no significant injury with either wool or grain dusts.

In this study, we examined whether exposure to PFRs Triphenylphosphate (TPHP) and Tris(1, 3 -dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) affected activation/maturation of DCs at steady state and during exposure to house dust mite allergens (HDM). Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were exposed to a concentration range of each PFR (0. 1 - 100 μM) with or without HDM in vitro to analyze {{the effect on the}} expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII), co-stimulatory molecules and cytokine production. Concentrations of TPHP and TDCIPP of ≥ 50 μM were cytotoxic to BMDCs. At these cytotoxic concentrations, TPHP exposure induced an activated phenotype in steady state DCs, while HDM exposed DCs acquired a tolerogenic phenotype. In contrast, TDCIPP exposure had no effect at steady state DCs but suppressed the expression of MHCII, costimulatory molecules, and the IL- 6 production in HDM exposed DCs. The cytotoxic concentrations induced the anti-oxidant enzyme hemeoxigenase- 1, which is a marker for oxidative stress. These results demonstrate that PFRs can be immunotoxic for DCs and suggest the necessity to evaluate the effects on the immune system on a cellular level during the risk assessment of these alternative flame retardant...|$|R

Medication did not influence basal cytokine production. Fluticasone inhibited LPS-induced IL- 6 and IL- 8 release (P < 0 · 05). There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups. There was a large and significant increase (P < 0 · 05) in alveolar macrophage, granulocyte, lymphocyte numbers, and IL- 6 and TNF-α content in BALF in all three groups following dust exposure, with no significant difference between the groups. These findings suggest that drugs which are known to influence and control airway inflammation in asthma do not have major effects on airway inflammation induced by the inhalation of organic dust...|$|R
40|$|Capture of {{high-speed}} (hypervelocity) particles in aerogel at ambient temperatures of 175 – 763 K is reported. This extends previous work which has mostly focussed on conducting experiments at ambient laboratory temperatures, even though aerogels {{are intended for}} use in cosmic <b>dust</b> capture <b>cells</b> in space environments which may experience a range of temperatures (e. g., the NASA Stardust mission which collected dust at 1. 81 AU and putative Mars atmospheric sampling missions). No significant change in track length (normalised to impactor size) was found over the range 175 – 600 K, although at 763 K a significant reduction (30 %) was found. By contrast, entrance hole diameter remained constant only up to 400 K, above this sudden changes of up to 50 % were observed. Experiments were also carried out at normal laboratory temperature using {{a wide range of}} aerogel densities and particle sizes. It was found that track length normalised to particle size varies inversely with aerogel density. This is a power law dependence and not linear as previously reported, with longer tracks at lower densities. Glass projectiles (up to 100 μm size) were found to undergo a variety of degrees of damage during capture. In addition to the well known acquisition of a coating (partial or complete) of molten aerogel the mechanical damage includes pitting and meridian fractures. Larger (500 μm diameter) stainless steel spheres also showed damage during capture. In this case melting and ablation occurs, suggesting surficial temperatures during impact in excess of 1400 °C. The response of the aerogel itself to passage of particles through it is reported. The presence of fan-like fractures around the tracks is attributed to cone cracking similar to that in glasses of normal density, with the difference that here it is a repetitive process as the particles pass through the aerogel...|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} Considered {{during the}} past decades as <b>cell</b> <b>dust,</b> microparticles are now deemed true biomarkers and vectors of biological information between cells. Depending on their origin, the composition of microparticles varies and the subsequent message transported by them, such as proteins, mRNA, or miRNA, can differ. Recent studies have described microparticles as “cargos” of deleterious information in blood vessel wall under pathological situations such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, and metabolic syndrome. In addition, {{it has been reported}} that depending on their origin, microparticles also possess a therapeutic potential regarding angiogenesis. Microparticles can act directly through the interaction ligand/receptor or indirectly on angiogenesis by modulating soluble factor production involved in endothelial cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and adhesion; by reprogramming endothelial mature cells; and by inducing changes in levels, phenotype, and function of endothelial progenitor cells. This results in an increase in formation of in vitro capillary-like tubes and the generation of new vessels in vivo under ischemic conditions, for instance. Taking into consideration these properties of microparticles, recent evidence provides new basis to expand the possibility that microparticles might be used as therapeutic tools in pathologies associated with an alteration of angiogenesis. </p...|$|R
