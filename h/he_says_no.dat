The next day Zsa Zsa makes a joke when Leon speaks after a prolonged silence, causing Leon to walk out. She finds him to apologise, as she had not realised the discovery had affected him badly. He then recalls the day his mother {{died in a car}} crash when it took an hour for firemen to cut him free and he was unable to lean over to close his mother's eyes. He admits to Zsa Zsa that he sometimes feels alone. He fails most of his GCSE exams. Months later he flirts with Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) in the local bookmaker's and agree to meet later. He obtains two tickets to a music festival in France and plans to take Zsa Zsa, but he reveals to Fatboy that he slept with Glenda, who tells Mercy, who then tells Zsa Zsa.

Before leaving, he tells Fatboy that he will always be his best friend and they continue to stay in touch.|$|E
500|$|Killen {{has said}} that he has seen {{interesting}} theories about the finale's meaning. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>no</b> theory is [...] "wrong" [...] except those which compared Awake finale to Dallas (an American television soap opera) or Newhart (an American television sitcom). He supposed that there was the [...] "überpossibility" [...] that Michael was in a coma, or had a new third reality created, but it was not interpreted as [...] "He woke up and his family was fine. He'd just been having two nightmares." [...] Killen said [...] "we actively fought against" [...] the idea that the series was Michael's dream; what seeing his wife and son together [...] "really represents is a further fracturing of his psyche". A second season, Killen said, would have explored the idea of Michael's wife and son both living but not (necessarily) a third reality. Another season also raised the possibility of Tara and Michael beginning a romantic relationship. Since the finale was written before the show's cancellation, it was written so either reality could have been the [...] "real" [...] one: [...] " [...] didn't intend to have that mystery sewn up in [...] ".|$|E

500|$|Bede's {{account of}} the {{conversion}} is oft-cited. After Paulinus explains the tenets of Christianity, the king asks his counselors {{what they think of}} the new doctrine. Edwin's priest Coifi responds that they may be worthwhile; after all, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>no</b> one has been more respectful of and devoted to their gods than he, and he has seen no benefits from his dedication to them. Then, an unnamed counselor stands up and addresses the king, also seeing the benefit of the new faith. Coifi speaks again and announces that they should destroy the idols and temples they had hitherto worshiped. King Edwin agrees and embraces Christianity; Coifi himself will set fire to the idols. declaring [...] "I will do this myself, for now that the true God has granted me knowledge, who more suitably than I can set a public example, and destroy the idols that I worshipped in ignorance?” Bede goes on to describe the scene as Cofi [...] "formally renounces his superstitions, and asked the king to give him arms and a stallion." [...] Armed with both a sword and spear, Cofi rides Edwin’s horse towards the idols, all within view of the crowd gathered to witness Edwin’s conversion. Upon reaching the temple, Cofi [...] "cast a spear into it and profaned it." ...|$|E
500|$|Within the series, set {{during the}} Prohibition-era of the United States, Isaac and Miria [...] "are {{a pair of}} idiotic lovers and thieves" [...] who are portrayed as [...] "always {{enthusiastic}} and optimistic". They are often mistaken for performers because {{of the variety of}} disguises they employ during their heists, such as dressing up as mummies or as the Tramp. The duo commit a variety of eccentric robberies, including attempting to steal time by stealing watches, trying to stop anyone from entering a museum by stealing the entrance and stealing the Genoard family fortune to prevent the family from fighting over it. Miria exhibits a complete trust in Isaac and supports anything <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>no</b> matter how ridiculous it is and often goes as far to mimic his body language and his speech, although she often does not really know what she is saying. Although the pair are very idiotic, Isaac is not completely stupid and there are occasions that shows that he displays his inner intelligence. He is able to recognize a pair of plainclothes officers because he claims that he is familiar with their speech style. Isaac and Miria may have been born into wealthy families because they state that their parents' homes and the Genoard mansion have similar exteriors.|$|E

2500|$|Norman Finkelstein {{argues that}} there has been no {{significant}} rise in antisemitism: [...] "What does the evidence show? There has been good investigation done, serious investigation. All the evidence shows there's no evidence at all for a rise of a new anti-Semitism, whether in Europe or in North America. The evidence is zero. And, in fact, there's a new book put out by an Israel stalwart. His name is Walter Laqueur, a very prominent scholar. It's called The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism. It just came out, 2006, from Oxford University Press. He looks at the evidence, and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>no.</b> There's some in Europe among the Muslim community, there's some anti-Semitism, but the notion that in the heart of European society or North American society there's anti-Semitism is preposterous. And in fact — or no, a significant rise in anti-Semitism is preposterous." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Verona, Petruchio {{begins the}} [...] "taming" [...] {{of his new}} wife. She is refused food and {{clothing}} because nothing – according to Petruchio – {{is good enough for}} her; he claims perfectly cooked meat is overcooked, a beautiful dress doesn't fit right, and a stylish hat is not fashionable. He also disagrees with everything she says, forcing her to agree with everything <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>no</b> matter how absurd; on their way back to Padua to attend Bianca's wedding, she agrees with Petruchio that the sun is the moon, and proclaims [...] "if you please to call it a rush-candle,/Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me" [...] (4.5.14–15). Along the way, they meet Vincentio, who is also on his way to Padua, and Katherina agrees with Petruchio when he declares that Vincentio is a woman, and then apologises to Vincentio when Petruchio tells her he is a man.|$|E
2500|$|At {{three o'clock}} in the afternoon, the commedia troupe enters the village to the cheering of the villagers. Canio {{describes}} the night's performance: the troubles of Pagliaccio. He says the play will begin at [...] "ventitré ore", an agricultural method of time-keeping that means the play will begin an hour before sunset. As Nedda steps down from the cart, Tonio offers his hand, but Canio pushes him aside and helps her down himself. The villagers suggest drinking at the tavern. Canio and Beppe accept, but Tonio stays behind. The villagers tease Canio that Tonio is planning an affair with Nedda. Canio warns everyone that while he may act the foolish husband in the play, in real life he will not tolerate other men making advances to Nedda. Shocked, a villager asks if Canio really suspects her. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>no,</b> and sweetly kisses her on the forehead. As the church bells ring vespers, he and Beppe leave for the tavern, leaving Nedda alone.|$|E

2500|$|Nikita [...] "Nikki" [...] Singh {{is played}} by Anannya Kolvankar, and is the title {{character}} and the second-youngest Singh child. She is generally portrayed as being happy. It sometimes takes a few tries {{to get her to}} do the right thing. Many of the Singh family's adventures revolve around Nikki. Both her older brothers, Rohan and Sunny, are often seen using Nikki for their own benefit, although Rohan shows that he cares about her deeply. Sunny seems to dislike Nikki the most although, in some episodes, he is seen being quite fond of her. Himani thinks of Nikki as the perfect baby. It was revealed in [...] "Nikki is 1!" [...] that it was Dolly's idea to nickname her Nikki. Nikki speaks more often in later episodes of seasons two and three. Bobby was born on her birthday; she responded to this by [...] "I like this present." [...] In season three, her personality begins to develop, as she is seen as sneaky and mischievous, such as pretending to like a doll Himani bought for her to like Bobby, then throwing it away when she was not looking, and also telling Himani's [...] "friends" [...] what she really thinks of them, causing her to lose them all. Also, she is shown as not liking Bobby as in the episode [...] "The Extravagant Couch", when she asks Avatar if Bobby is going to stay at the hotel and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>no</b> and Nikki asks if they can talk about it. In Good Luck Charlie, Nikki is the equivalent of Charlie Duncan who {{is played by}} Mia Talerico.|$|E
2500|$|Prue is in a {{park with}} Mac when crows {{come in and take}} the baby off. Prue runs after Mac ({{followed}} by her classmate Curtis) who discovers he has been taken to the Impassable Wilderness. Prue heads home to her parents and manages {{to make it look like}} she still has Mac. Next morning she heads for the I.W. but discovers Curtis has once more followed her. Prue does not want Curtis along, but before she can send him back, they are separated while fleeing from Coyote Soldiers. Curtis is captured and taken to Alexandra, while Prue rides a mail truck to South Wood. There, Prue finds a Kafkaesque bureaucracy and dysfunctional government. Police state tactics and paranoia over foreign threats are used to keep the regime in power. Prue eventually meets the Crown Prince Owl Rex (who is later arrested), of the Avian Principality, who tells her how Alexandra came to be exiled. Alexandra's son Alexei died in a horse-riding accident, then her husband Grigor died of heartbreak; to remedy his death, Alexandra hired the two greatest toymakers in all of Wildwood to fashion her son a new body that was later brought to life via Black Magic by recalling his soul, but later Alexei learned the truth of his death and rebirth and so he destroyed a crucial part of his inner workings resulting in his death. Alexandra was exiled for the use of Black Magic and plotted her revenge, but many believed she would have never survived. Owl Rex proposes to Prue to cross Wildwood and find help from the Mystics of North Wood. Meanwhile, Alexandra is flattering Curtis with a fancy uniform and commissions him into the coyote army as an officer. In a battle against bandits Curtis breaks a howitzer by dumb luck, becoming a coyote war hero in the operation. He then finds [...] Mac in Alexandra's headquarters and she shows him her plan to sacrifice the baby to the ivy. Alexandra offers to share the power with Curtis, but <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>no</b> and is locked away with some other captured bandits and unfaithful coyotes.|$|E
