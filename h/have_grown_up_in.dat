25|$|Lead {{smelters}} {{contribute to}} several environmental problems, especially raised blood lead levels {{in some of}} the town population. The problem is particularly significant in many children who <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the area. There is a government project to address this. Nyrstar plans to progressively reduce lead in blood levels such that ultimately 95% of all children meet the national goal of 10 micrograms per decilitre. This has been known as the tenby10 project. Community lead in blood levels in children are now at less than half the level that they were in the mid 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Eclecticism is {{not open}} to the {{superficial}} objection of proceeding without a system or test in determining the complete or incomplete. But it is open to objection, assuming that a particular analysis of consciousness has reached all the possible elements in humanity and in history, and all their combinations. It may be asked, Can history have that which {{is not in the}} individual consciousness? In a sense not; but our analysis may not give all that is there, and we ought not at once to impose that analysis or any formula on history. History is as likely to reveal to us in the first place true and original elements, and combinations of elements in man, as a study of consciousness. Besides, the tendency of applying a formula of this sort to history is to assume that the elements are developed in a certain regular or necessary order, whereas this may not at all be the case; but we may find at any epoch the whole mixed, either crossing or co-operative, as in the consciousness of the individual himself. Further, the question as to how these elements may possibly <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the general consciousness of mankind is assumed to be nonexistent or impossible.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{expectation}} of millennial success, there have been recent studies that have proven this to not be the case.
