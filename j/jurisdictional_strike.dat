25|$|About March 5, 1939, a {{labor dispute}} halted {{work in the}} bridge. The <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strike</b> {{occurred}} {{in a dispute over}} whether the steel workers or rod workers union would have the right to trim steel rods on the project. The dispute lasted nearly two weeks. Both unions agreed to return to work on March 19, pending a resolution of their dispute through arbitration.|$|E
25|$|By early October, final {{construction}} on the exhibit hall was ahead of schedule. City officials estimated that the convention center would now be ready {{in time for the}} American Mining Congress trade show in May 1964. A formal opening would occur in August. A slight problem in construction occurred when 30 unionized carpenters walked off the job on October 8 in a <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strike</b> with the Laborers' Union over unloading of material. This delayed construction of a ramp for two days.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jurisdictional</b> <b>strikes</b> occur most {{frequently}} in the United States in the construction industry. Construction unions frequently resolve those disputes through a privately created adjustment system.|$|R
25|$|Jurisdictional {{disputes}} between unions became {{more frequent and}} intractable over time, occupying much of {{the attention of the}} American Federation of Labor (AFL). Nearly 95 percent of all strikes from 1897 to 1914 were <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strikes.</b> Increasingly, the debate involved a growing battle over craft versus industrial unionism.|$|R
5000|$|The Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO (BCTD) is a constitutionally {{mandated}} {{department of}} the AFL-CIO. It was founded on February 10, 1908, {{as a way to}} overcome the jurisdictional conflicts occurring in the building and construction trade unions. It was largely unsuccessful in this task; conflict ended only after the Taft-Hartley Act largely outlawed <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Salad Bowl {{strike was}} a series of strikes, mass pickets, boycotts and {{secondary}} boycotts that began on August 23, 1970 and led to the largest farm worker strike in U.S. history. The strike was led by the United Farm Workers against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The Salad Bowl strike was only in part a <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strike,</b> for many of the actions taken during the event were not strikes. The strike led directly to the passage of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975.|$|E
25|$|Labor unions use {{the term}} {{jurisdiction}} to refer to their claims to represent workers who perform {{a certain type of}} work and the right of their members to perform such work. For example, the work of unloading containerized cargo at United States ports, which the International Longshoremen's Association, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters have claimed rightfully should be assigned to workers they represent. A <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strike</b> is a concerted refusal to work undertaken by a union to assert its members' right to such job assignments and to protest the assignment of disputed work to members of another union or to unorganized workers. Jurisdictional strikes occur most frequently in the United States in the construction industry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{construction}} project's labor troubles worsened in 1933. With the Depression deepening, contractors were {{pressing for}} a 27.3 percent wage cut with their unions, particularly the carpenters' union. On January 6, 1933, a fire {{swept through the}} upper floors of the unfinished ICC building. The fire was ruled arson and a [...] "disgruntled carpenter" [...] was suspected. Two weeks later, the operating engineers and steamfitters unions engaged in a <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strike</b> against one another, stopping work at the Post Office construction site, but the AFL intervened and arbitrated {{a solution to the}} dispute. The earlier wage dispute, however, had not been resolved, and by February a general strike among all unionized workers at the Federal Triangle complex seemed likely. Employers said they would fire all unionized workers if a strike occurred and replace them with strikebreakers. The two sides agreed to let the Treasury Department arbitrate their dispute, and on February 13 the government ruled in favor of the unions—averting a job action. The employers went to court, and in April 1933 the carpenters agreed to the 27.3 percent wage cut.|$|E
25|$|In <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strikes,</b> outlawed by Taft–Hartley, a union {{strikes in}} order to assign {{particular}} work to the employees it represents. Secondary boycotts and common situs picketing, also outlawed by the act, are actions in which unions picket, strike, or refuse to handle the goods of a business with which they have no primary dispute but which {{is associated with a}} targeted business. A later statute, the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, passed in 1959, tightened these restrictions on secondary boycotts still further.|$|R
25|$|McGuire's successors {{took a more}} {{aggressive}} stance toward other unions whose members were performing work that the Carpenters union either considered its own members' right to perform or saw {{as a threat to}} their craft traditions. The union waged <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strikes</b> to claim work that other unions, such as the Machinists, Sheet Metal Workers and Electrical Workers claimed as theirs. The Carpenters used its size to win many of these disputes. After the death of president James Kirby in 1915, it frequently disaffiliated from the AFL's Building Trades Department to protest those decisions it lost.|$|R
50|$|Hutcheson's outspoken {{politics}} {{may have}} played a role in the Roosevelt administration's attempt to convict Hutcheson and other union leaders for criminal violations of the Sherman Act in 1940. The government claimed that the union's traditional methods of protecting its members' work — <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strikes,</b> resistance to work-displacing technology, and featherbedding — were illegal restraints of trade. The United States Supreme Court upheld the district court's dismissal of the indictment in the first prosecution brought by the government in United States v. Hutcheson, , ending any further prosecutions of Carpenters officials.|$|R
2500|$|August 1933 saw the {{eruption}} {{of a series of}} labor-management disputes and inter-union squabbles that put construction of the Federal Triangle complex on hold for several months. The first event was when the Journeyman Stonecutters Association of North America walked out on a <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strike</b> against the iron workers' union on August 21, idling 225 men working on the Post Office building. The dispute was over which union would ride with crane operators to coordinate the movement of loads with workers on the ground. The strike lasted at least until September 7, with both sides seeking a decision from the American Federation of Labor. Then on September 1, 75 carpenters walked off the job in a jurisdictional dispute with the iron worker's union. This dispute, which occurred at the Labor/ICC building, was over which workers would be permitted to install decorative enclosures around radiators. With work on the Labor/ICC buildings already two months behind schedule due to the earlier labor disputes, the employers threatened to stop all work if the carpenters' union struck and throw another 1,000 men out of work. The employers shut down on September 15. Twenty security guards were stationed at the Labor/ICC building to prevent vandalism. On September 18, a third <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strike</b> occurred when the boilermakers' union walked off the job at the Federal Triangle central heating plant to protest the use of iron workers in the erection of smokestacks for the facility. Construction of the smokestacks continued, but construction of the boilers was halted. A fourth <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strike</b> erupted on September 20, when 80 members of the bricklayers' union walked off the job at the heating plant to protest the use of laborers to caulk windows, stone, and roof tiles. Although the bricklayers remained on the job for the moment, government officials feared that sympathy strikes would occur, stopping work at all seven construction sites. The carpenters rejected a call for the government to arbitrate the strike, and the employers asked for Senator Robert F. Wagner (a proponent of organized labor) to help settle the disputes. On September 26, the AFL ruled that the smokestack work properly belonged to the iron workers, and ordered the boilermakers back to work. But the carpenters' union initiated a new protest, arguing that the installation of pulley linings in elevators belonged to them and not to the elevator constructors' union. And the Washington Building and Construction Trades Council threatened to call a general strike of all construction workers if the bricklayers were not pulled off the job installing boiler insulation and the asbestos workers' union allowed to do the job instead. Senator Wagner also said on Sept. 28 that he believed a resolution to the carpenters/iron workers dispute (which had led to the layoff of 1,000 workers at the Labor/ICC building) could be reached. But the boilermakers did not return to work, leaving 450 workers laid off. Meanwhile, government officials said that the caulking, insulation, and pulley work disputes would be resolved soon, and would not in any case cause further disruptions at construction sites. Another major work disruption threatened the Federal Triangle complex when the iron workers' union demanded that contractors initiate two four-hour shifts per day rather than one eight-hour shift per day in order to spread work among more men. When contractors balked, the union struck at the Post Office and Justice building sites. That strike lasted two days before about half of the employers capitulated. But it continued for the remaining employers at the Justice and Post Office buildings. Finally, on October 11, 1933, frustrated and angry Labor Department officials said that unless the jurisdictional disputes were ended quickly, the government would seek authorization from Congress in January to force the unions back to work and resolve the disputes itself. The threat worked: [...] On October 13, all parties to all jurisdictional disputes agreed to return to work while continuing to seek resolution to their problems via other channels. Federal officials excoriated the carpenters' union for holding up a $40,000-a-week payroll for four weeks over an $800 job. Eleven days later, the iron workers' union agreed to return to the eight-hour shift.|$|E
2500|$|The labor {{peace was}} short-lived. Four unions {{refused to do}} work on the Post Office {{conveyor}} belt system in mid-November, and the dispute over elevators spread to the Labor/ICC building in February 1934 (delaying the building's opening indefinitely). On February 14, 1934, 225 carpenters engaged in a <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strike</b> against the cement finishers' union at the Labor/ICC building over the installation of tile flooring. The dispute was elevated to AFL President William Green, Green awarded the job to the cement finishers on March 17. But just three weeks later, the plasterers' union led a <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strike</b> against the stonecutters' union at the Labor/ICC building because the stonecutters were installing acoustical marble columns. Contractors, angry at the repeated inter-union squabbles, announced they would no longer employ reduced-hour shifts or give pay raises. The carpenters' union called for a general strike of all unions at the Labor/ICC building on May 25, a strike which spread to the city's ice cream plants. That secondary strike ended June 4. But the general construction strike began to spread to other federal projects throughout the city, leading to {{an increasing number of}} calls for the strike to be settled by arbitration. As the work stoppage spread, the carpenters' union's contract with the construction companies expired on May 30. The employers declared on June 12 that they would no longer adhere to any closed shop agreements with the carpenters, and instead would impose the open shop and employ any carpenter (union or non-union) in order to finish the work on existing construction projects. The construction unions declared they would pull every worker off every job if non-union construction laborers were hired, and the D.C Metropolitan Police Department made preparations to patrol streets and job sites to prevent any violence from erupting. Non-union workers were hired, and the carpenters' union struck all job sites throughout the city amidst fears that the carpenters might strike all federal construction projects nationwide. Three union members were injured on June 13 as picketers clashed with security guards hired by the employers. But the strike did not spread to the other unions, and the Washington Building and Construction Trades Council and D.C. Commissioner George E. Allen attempted to mediate an end to the strike. The carpenters rejected the arbitration attempt, and bands of roving picketers moving among construction sites led to traffic tie-ups, frightened citizens, and rumors of violence. The [...] "open shop strike" [...] ended on June 20, 1934, when the carpenters agreed to a new contract providing for a five-day, 40-hour work week and $1.25 an hour in pay. But no agreement was made regarding the open shop. The plasterers' union ended their strike in June 1934, and went to local district court to resolve the jurisdictional dispute.|$|E

25|$|Formation of the Structural Building Trades Alliance was {{prompted}} {{by a series of}} strikes {{and the beginning of the}} open shop movement in 1903. A wave of <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strikes</b> in 1903 all but shut down construction in most major cities in the United States. Building contractor associations were also forming in several large cities, forcing unions to accept contracts which prohibited sympathy strikes, banned restrictions on the kind of work an employee might perform, and permitted the unlimited introduction of new machinery, materials and working methods. Employers were also pushing hard for an end to the closed shop, which threatened unions' membership gains.|$|R
5000|$|The Taft-Hartley {{amendments}} added {{a list of}} prohibited actions, or [...] "unfair labor practices", on {{the part}} of unions.

40|$|Federal labor {{legislation}} aims {{to reduce}} industrial strife, promote productive efficiency, and equalize bargaining power between employers and employees. To attain these interrelated objectives, the Taft-Hartley Act, like the Wagner Act, gives employees {{the right to}} engage in various forms of concerted activity free from management interference. Thus employees are free to join unions, to strike, to picket, and to bargain collectively. Not all concerted activities are protected, however. The Taft-Hartley Act expressly prohibits certain secondary boycotts, <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strikes,</b> and strikes for recognition in defiance of a certified union. Even before the passage of that Act, courts had held that strikes in breach of a collective bargaining agreement and strikes to force an employer to violate a federal law were outside the protective ambit of the Wagner Act. Strikes have also been denied protection if they contravene a federal statute, such as that forbidding mutiny, or if they violate state laws prohibiting the seizure of property or acts of violence...|$|R
25|$|The {{amendments}} {{enacted in}} Taft–Hartley added {{a list of}} prohibited actions, or unfair labor practices, {{on the part of}} unions to the NLRA, which had previously only prohibited unfair labor practices committed by employers.

40|$|This {{study shows}} that strikes in {{construction}} have, by most measures, increased during the years since 1949, a period during which strike activity tended to decline in American industry as a whole. The authors demonstrate that this increase has resulted not from {{an increase in the}} number of wage disputes but from a growing number of <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>strikes</b> and the increasing severity of economic and union-organizing strikes. They also show that the number of strikes in construction does not vary significantly with the unemployment rate in that industry nor with the presence of wage controls, but both of those factors have a significant impact on the composition of strike activity in construction...|$|R
