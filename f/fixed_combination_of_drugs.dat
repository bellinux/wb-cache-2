Methods. Patients aged 30 - 69 years with uncomplicated hypertension (140 - 179 / 90 - 109 mmHg) and two or fewer associated risk factors are eligible. After a 4 -week run-in period off treatment, 180 patients will be randomized to once daily bisoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide 5 / 6. 25 mg or amlodipine/valsartan 5 / 160 mg. To attain and maintain blood pressure below 140 / 90 mmHg during 6 months of follow-up, the doses of bisoprolol and amlodipine in the combination tablets will be increased to 10 mg/day with the possible addition of α-methyldopa or hydralazine. NOAAH is powered to demonstrate a 5 -mmHg between-group difference in sitting systolic pressure with a two-sided p-value of 0. 01 and 90 % power. NOAAH is investigator-led and complies with the Helsinki declaration. Results. Six centers in four sub-Saharan countries started patient recruitment on September 1, 2010.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveRecent {{hypertension}} guidelines recommend {{initiation of}} treatment with a <b>fixed</b> dose <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> two <b>drugs</b> for {{more effective and}} quicker blood pressure control. Few of these have been assessed for efficacy and acceptability. This study examines the short term blood pressure control and acceptability of perindopril, with or without its <b>fixed</b> dose <b>combinations</b> (FDC) with amlodipine and Indapamide in younger patients. MethodsIn a multicentre prospective observational study, patients with stage 1 hypertension were prescribed perindopril 4  mg per day. Those with stage 2 or 3 hypertension were prescribed a single tablet per day of 4  mg perindopril and 5  mg amlodipine (COVERSYL AM), or 4  mg perindopril and 1. 25  mg indapamide (COVERSYL PLUS) for 45 days. The primary outcomes were the frequency of patients achieving blood pressure control and the adverse effect of pedal edema. ResultsOf 426 patients, {{with a mean age}} of 45 years, distributed throughout India, and an average (SD) baseline systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 157. 2 (13. 5) / 98. 6 (7. 4), 303 (71. 1 %) achieved blood pressure control. Mean (SD) SBP/DBP decreased from baseline by 26. 9 (12. 6), and DBP by 15. 4 (7. 2)  mm Hg.

In addition, they received in random order 25 mg chlorthalidone, 200 mg metoprolol (slow release), and a <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> these two <b>drugs.</b> Each drug treatment was given for four weeks and alternated with four weeks of placebo. Forty four patients were allocated to sodium restriction (group 1) and 50 to normal diet (group 2).

40|$|BackgroundMost {{individuals}} at high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk worldwide {{do not receive}} any or optimal preventive drugs. We aimed to determine whether <b>fixed</b> dose <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> generic <b>drugs</b> (‘polypills’) would promote use of such medications. MethodsWe conducted a randomized, open-label trial involving 623 participants from Australian general practices. Participants had established CVD or an estimated five-year CVD risk of ≥ 15 %, with indications for antiplatelet, statin and ≥ 2 blood pressure lowering drugs (‘combination treatment’). Participants randomized to the ‘polypill-based strategy’ received a polypill containing aspirin 75  mg, simvastatin 40  mg, lisinopril 10  mg and either atenolol 50  mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12. 5  mg. Participants randomized to ‘usual care’ continued with separate medications and doses as prescribed by their doctor. Primary outcomes were self-reported combination treatment use, systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol. ResultsAfter a median of 18 months, the polypill-based strategy was associated with greater use <b>of</b> <b>combination</b> treatment (70 % vs. 47 %; relative risk 1. 49, (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 30 to 1. 72) p <  0. 0001; number needed to treat =  4. 4 (3. 3 to 6. 6)) without differences in systolic blood pressure (− 1. 5  mmHg (95 % CI − 4. 0 to 1. 0) p =  0. 24) or total cholesterol (0. 08  mmol/l (95 % CI − 0. 06 to 0. 22) p =  0. 26). At study end, 17 % and 67 % of participants in polypill and usual care groups, respectively, were taking atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. ConclusionProvision of a polypill improved self-reported use of indicated preventive treatments. The lack of differences in blood pressure and cholesterol may reflect limited study power, although for cholesterol, improved statin use in the polypill group counter-balanced use of more potent statins with usual care...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{assessment}} of prescribing performance by aggregated measures mainly developed from automated databases is often helpful for general practitioners. For asthma treatment, the frequently applied ratio of anti-inflammatory to bronchodilator drugs may, however, be misleading if the specificity <b>of</b> a <b>drug</b> {{for the treatment}} of asthma, compared with other diseases, is unknown. AIM: To test the association <b>of</b> specific <b>drugs</b> with the diagnosis of asthma compared with other diagnoses. DESIGN OF STUDY: Cross-sectional study analysing prescription data from a retrospective chart review. SETTING: Eight general practices and one community respiratory practice in a town in Northern Germany. METHOD: All patients in the participating practices who received {{at least one of the}} 50 asthma drugs most frequently prescribed in Germany within the past 12 weeks were identified. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (ClI) were calculated to reveal any association between a specific drug and the diagnosis of asthma. The unit of analysis was the item prescribed. RESULTS: Topical betamimetics (e. g salbutamol, fenoterol) were the most often prescribed asthma drugs in the general practices (52. 1) and in the respiratory practice (57. 6 %). Inhaled steroids accounted for 15 % and 13 %; systemic steroids accounted for 10 % and 13 %, respectively. In the general practices, inhaled betamimetics had a moderate marker function for asthma (OR = 2. 0; 95 % CI = 1. 14 - 3. 58). A <b>fixed</b> oral <b>combination</b> <b>drug</b> <b>of</b> clenbuterol plus ambroxol was a marker drug against asthma (OR = 0. 35; 95 % CI = 0. 20 - 0. 61). In the respiratory practice, the diagnosis of asthma was strongly marked by <b>fixed</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> cromoglycate plus betamimetics (OR = 29. 0; 95 % CI = 6. 86 - 122. 24) and moderately by inhaled betamimetics (OR = 2. 6; 95 % CI = 1. 28 - 5. 14). In contrast, systemic steroids (OR = 0. 24; 95 % CI 0. 10 - 0. 57) and even inhaled steroids (OR = 0. 46; 95 % ClI= 0. 22 - 0. 96) proved to contradict the diagnosis of asthma. CONCLUSION: Only betamimetics were markers for asthma patients in both types of practices; inhaled steroids, however, were not. <b>Combinations</b> <b>of</b> cromoglycate were markers in the respiratory practice only. Limited specificity <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> for a disease (e. g asthma) should be taken into account when analysing prescribing data that are not diagnosis linked...|$|R

This was a phase II, multi-centre, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy study. After a 2 -week run-in period, 160 patients with moderate asthma were randomized to a 6 -week treatment with ciclesonide/formoterol 320 / 9  μg bid (CIC/F) or fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250 / 50  μg bid (FP/S), both delivered as powder formulations. The primary outcome FEV 1 increased during treatment by 0. 356  L in the CIC/F group and by 0. 288  L in the FP/S group (p <  0. 0001). The increases were statistically significant and clinically relevant. The between-treatment analysis demonstrated non-inferiority of CIC/F to FP/S treatment (p <  0. 0001).

Material and methods. Patients (n= 75) with moderate hypertension (HT) accompanied by type 2 diabetes (DM) were studied. The patients were randomized in groups A, B or C. Patients of group A (n= 25) received a <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the original perindopril+indapamide, patients of group B (n= 30) — a <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the generic enalapril+indapamide, patients of group C (n= 20) — a <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the original enalapril+hydrochlorothiazide. Office BP was examined within the 4, 8 and 12 weeks, EDVD and MAU were determined initially and after 12 weeks of therapy. CER was also calculated. Results. The maximal antihypertensive effect was observed in group C (systolic BP (SBP) decreased in 46. 6 ± 1. 3 mm Hg), followed by group A (SBP decreased in 43. 1 ± 0. 8 mm Hg) and B (SBP decreased in 40. 0 ± 0. 8 mm Hg). The groups were distributed as follows (in descending order) : according to EDVD rise - group A (Δ 4. 52 %), C (Δ 3. 14 %) B (Δ 3 %); according to MAU prevalence rate reduction - group A (from 48 % to 8 %), B (from 40 % to 23 %) and C (from 40 % to 25 %).

A lower tablet burden should also facilitate adherence to treatment. A new <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> mefloquine plus artesunate has been developed. This was compared with the conventional regimen of separate tablets for the treatment of uncomplicated multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria. METHODS: On the north-western border of Thailand 500 adults and children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were randomized to receive either the new <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> or separate tablets. They were followed up weekly for 63 days. RESULTS: The day 63 polymerase chain reaction-adjusted cure rates were 91. 9 % (95 % CI 88. 2 - 95. 6) in the <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> group and 89. 2 % (85. 0 - 93. 4) in the loose tablets group (P= 0. 3). There was a lower incidence of early vomiting in the group receiving the <b>fixed</b> <b>combination.</b> CONCLUSION: This new <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> mefloquine and artesunate was efficacious, well tolerated and convenient to administer...|$|R

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) type 2 {{is associated}} {{not only with}} hyperglycemia, but also with an increased atherogenic risk. Due to this glucose-lowering therapy should be not only effective, but also safe regarding the development of micro- and macrovascular complications. To intensify hypoglycemic therapy in patients who do not achieve disease compensation at monotherapy with metformin or sulfonylureas, <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> these two oral hypoglycemic agents is considered reasonable. One <b>of</b> these <b>combinations,</b> that can effectively, safely and economically feasible to achieve therapeutic objectives of treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2, is considered <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> metformin and glibenclamide (Glibomet). The most important advantages <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>combinations</b> include low doses <b>of</b> each <b>drug</b> component without loss of anti-diabetic efficacy, {{a significant decrease in}} side effects from the gastrointestinal tract, minimizing the risk of hypoglycemic reactions and others.

40|$|Introduction Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} frequent cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in many countries as well as in our country. That explains why medications for the treatment of CVD {{are the most}} used group <b>of</b> <b>drugs.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this study was to analyze the consumption of ACE-inhibitors in Serbia and Norway during 2009 and 2010. Material and methods The data about the use of ACE-inhibitors in Serbia and Norway in 2009 and 2010 were taken from the Agency for Drugs and Medical Devices of the Republic of Serbia and from the site of Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Results Use <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> first choice in the treatment of hypertension in Serbia was very uneven, where the consumption of ACE-inhibitors was dominant. Opposed to this condition, the consumption of the first choice antihypertensive drugs was very balanced in Norway. During both analyzed years large part of consumption of ACE-inhibitors was taken by more expensive drugs in Serbia, as fosinopril, cilazapril and quinapril. In Norway in the observed period, dominated the consumption <b>of</b> cheaper <b>drugs</b> such as enalapril and ramipril. The situation is similar when it comes to <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> diuretics and ACE-inhibitors. In Norway dominated the <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> diuretics and cheaper ACE-inhibitors like enalapril and lisinopril. However, in Serbia, we have large consumption <b>fixed</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> diuretics with expensive ACE-inhibitors, such as cilazapril and fosinopril. Conclusions In both countries, ACE-inhibitors and their <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> with diuretics are most frequently used drugs within the group <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> which is used for treatment of CVD in Serbia in 2009 and 2010. The amount and structure of the utilized ACE-inhibitors in Serbia is different from the amount and structure of the utilized ACE inhibitors in Norway. From pharmacoeconomic point of view, high consumption of expensive ACE-inhibitors (plain and <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> with diuretics) in 2009 and 2010 in Serbia resulted in the higher spending of funds...|$|R

40|$|Psoriasis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} skin disease affecting about 2 - 3 % of general population. Within {{the last years}} better understanding of psoriasis etiology resulted in rapid development of new and effective treatment modalities, mainly biological drugs. In the era of biologics, however, topical therapy still represents a valuable method of psoriasis treatment, especially in patients with milder disease. Also in patients who require systemic therapy, topical treatment may be of interest, as it may shorten the time necessary to obtain clinical improvement and reduce the cumulative dose <b>of</b> systemic <b>drugs.</b> Here, we have reviewed data about the use <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> calcipotriol and betamethazone dipropionate as the topical treatment of psoriasis.
