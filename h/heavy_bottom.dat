40|$|Introduction The {{measurements}} of B lifetimes {{are important for}} the determination of elements of the Cabibbo-KobayashiMaskawa matrix. Moreover, {{measurements of}} the lifetimes of B-hadrons probe decay mechanisms beyond the simple spectator quark decay model. Lifetime differences can arise from unequal amplitudes for the annihilation and W -exchange diagrams, {{as well as from}} final state Pauli interference effects. In the case of charm mesons, such differences have been observed to be quite large ((D +) =(D 0) 2 : 5). Among bottom hadrons, the lifetime differences are expected to be smaller due to the <b>heavier</b> <b>bottom</b> quark mass. Phenomenological models predict a difference between the B + and B 0 meson lifetimes of the order of 5 %, and very similar B 0 <F 12. 2...|$|R

Repeated rolling and unrolling further enhance the extent of fractures. Thangkas are constructed by stitching, which creates potential areas of weakness because the fabric is pierced and compressed. When stitching threads degrade more rapidly than the fabric, the overall fragility in the structure is increased. The tension caused by weight differences between the central picture and the borders, the weight of the <b>heavy</b> <b>bottom</b> rod, further enhance the extent of fractures.|$|E

40|$|Squark mixing plays a {{large role}} in the {{phenomenology}} of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, determining the mass of the lightest Higgs boson and the electroweak interactions of the squarks themselves. We examine how mixing may be investigated in high energy $e^+ e^-$ reactions, both at LEP-II and the proposed linear collider. In particular, off-diagonal production of one lighter and one heavier squark allows one to measure the squark mixing angle, and would allow one to test the mass relations for the light Higgs boson. In some cases off-diagonal production may provide the best prospects to discover supersymmetry. In the context of the light bottom squark scenario, we show that existing data from LEP-II should show definitive evidence for the <b>heavier</b> <b>bottom</b> squark provided that its mass $m_{tilde{b}_ 2 } le 120 $ GeV...|$|R

40|$|A least-square {{kinematic}} fit using Lagrange multipliers {{is applied}} to enforce the mass constraints in the reconstructed pp → tt̅→ qq̅bμν_μb̅ events.

Utilizing the first integrated luminosity of 100 pb^- 1 of proton collisions at 14 TeV detected by the CMS detector, an uncertainty smaller than 1 % can be obtained on the jet energy scale for both light and heavy jets.

40|$|The {{arena of}} doubly and triply heavy baryons remains {{experimentally}} unexplored {{to a large}} extent. This {{has led to a}} great deal of theoretical effort being put forth in the calculation of mass spectra in this sector. Although the detection of such heavy particle states may lie beyond the reach of experiments for some time, it is interesting to compare results between lattice QCD computations and continuum theoretical models. Several recent lattice QCD calculations exist for both doubly and triply charmed as well as doubly and triply bottom baryons. In this work we present preliminary results from the first lattice calculation of the mass spectrum of doubly and triply heavy baryons including both charm and bottom quarks. The wide range of quark masses in these systems require that the various flavors of quarks be treated with different lattice actions. We use domain wall fermions for 2 + 1 flavors (up down and strange) of sea and valence quarks, a relativistic heavy quark action for the charm quarks, and non-relativistic QCD for the <b>heavier</b> <b>bottom</b> quarks. The calculation of the ground state spectrum is presented and compared to recent models...|$|R
