40|$|The {{realization}} of molecular electronics demands a detailed {{knowledge of the}} correlation between chemical groups and <b>electronic</b> <b>function.</b> It has become obvious during the last years that the conformation of a molecule and its coupling to the connecting electrodes {{plays a crucial role}} in its conductance behavior and its <b>electronic</b> <b>function,</b> e. g., as a switch. Knowledge about these relationships is therefore essential for future design of molecular electronic building blocks. We present a new three-dimensional molecule, consisting of three identical molecular wires connected to a headgroup. Due to the well-defined spatial arrangement of the molecule in a nonplanar geometry, it is possible to investigate the conductance behavior of these wires with respect to their position and coupling to the surface electrode with the submolecular resolution of a scanning tunneling microscope. The experimental findings are supported by calculations of the electronic structure and conformation of the molecule on the surface by density functional theory with dispersion corrections...|$|R

5000|$|Because of {{the small}} size of the fluidic conduits, nanofluidic {{structures}} are naturally applied in situations demanding that samples be handled in exceedingly small quantities, including Coulter counting, analytical separations and determinations of biomolecules, such as proteins and DNA, and facile handling of mass-limited samples. One of the more promising areas of nanofluidics is its potential for integration into microfluidic systems, i.e. micrototal analytical systems or lab-on-a-chip structures. For instance, NCAMs, when incorporated into microfluidic devices, can reproducibly perform digital switching, allowing transfer of fluid from one microfluidic channel to another, selectivity separate and transfer analytes by size and mass, mix reactants efficiently, and separate fluids with disparate characteristics. In addition, there is a natural analogy between the fluid handling capabilities of nanofluidic structures and the ability of electronic components to control the flow of electrons and holes. This analogy has been used to realize active <b>electronic</b> <b>functions</b> such as rectification and field-effect and bipolar transistoraction with ionic currents.
