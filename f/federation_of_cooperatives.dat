40|$|The Burkina Faso {{government}} handed UCOBAM (the Burkina Union of Agricutural and Market Garden Cooperatives), a <b>federation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> back to {{its members}} in September 1991. This something of a revolution for the members as, for the first time, they {{have been responsible for}} appointing their own director and staff. Since it was set up in 1968 UCOBAM had been regulated by the state, which appointed its staff and steered it in the direction the government wanted. However its top-heavy administrative structure, bad management and lack of any commercial initiative meant that it was not fulfilling its objectives of marketing market garden produce and guaranteeing the export and sale of green beans to the European markets. The interests of the producers, who were forced to work through UCOBAM, were not being served. Now the small-scale growers themselves are back in charge of their own cooperative, which they want to make as dynamic and efficient as the many private companies which are mushrooming in Burkina Faso. This is quite a challenge for the new team, but the beneficial effects of deregulation can already be seen: mango exports have picked up and the losses to last season`s bean crop were minimal.

Eight farms with different scales of operation were selected by FECOAVESTRUZ-Sudeste for the application of ‘integrated environmental indicator systems’, designed to develop Environmental Management Reports and to propose best management practices in the farms. The results showed that, in general, indicators relative to Use of inputs and resources, Use of veterinary inputs and raw-materials, and especially Use of energy tended to generate negative impact, because ostrich production was intensive in these farms. On the other hand, this intensive production was also associated with improvements in Income generation and Management and administration, with positive reflexes on Employment quality and Customer respect. The utilization of the ‘integrated environmental indicator systems ’ provide fast and inexpensive procedures designed to prepare producers for the eco-certification and ensuing sustainable origin denomination for ostrich production...|$|E

The ranking on yearly output of roughly processed tea in Nara is the 5 th among tea production prefectures in our country. The green tea which is famous as the "Yamatocha" is main crops of farming in the hilly region of so-called Yamato Plateau. The Nara Green Tea Market had been established in March of 1969 to develope the tea-plant farming in this plateau further by Nara Economic <b>Federation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cooperatives.</b> For this purpose about 150 million yen was invested, which was shared among the Federation, Prefectural Government and Central Government. Purposes on the establishment of tea market are as follows : 1) Modernization of green tea marketing. 2) Expectation on actualization of reasonable price through market function. 3) Preservation of good quality of tea through storing under the condition of proper low temperature and constant humidity. 4) Contribution to improvement on farm finace and farm credit. 5) Strengthening the system of tea marketing by cooperatives and expansion of marketing functions by cooperatives.

40|$|In 1991, {{the general}} {{assembly}} <b>of</b> Japanese agricultural <b>cooperatives</b> agreed on an organizational restructuring called the “two level business and administrative reorganization” Under this proposal, prefectural-level <b>federations</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>cooperatives</b> were to be abolished and their functions were to {{taken over by the}} national-level federations and business unit associations. The national-level federation was to supervise the business unit associations directly, i. e., so-called “two-level restructuring without middle levels”. Following this decision, the prefectural economic <b>federation</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>cooperatives</b> was reorganized into 34 prefectural headquarters under the Zennoh federation (Zennoh integrated type). In 5 prefectures, the former prefectural economic <b>federation</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>cooperatives</b> reorganized into 5 agricultural cooperatives; one per prefecture (United one type). In addition, 8 prefectural economic <b>federation</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>cooperatives</b> maintained their prefectural organization (Independent type) and decided to focus on sales as their primary economic activity in order to strengthen prefectural level functions. These eight, such as Hokuren, were powerful. Although there have been studies regarding the persistence of the independent prefectural cooperative, no comprehensive systematic study has been conducted. This study revealed several reasons why 8 prefectural cooperatives did not unite with Zennoh for more than 20 years after the restructuring. It also shows that the Independent type cooperative has economic advantage compared to the Zennoh integrated or United one typ...|$|R
