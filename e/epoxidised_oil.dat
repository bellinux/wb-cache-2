40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{aromatic}} oil (AO) {{is one of}} the substances that is typically used as a processing aid especially for high filler loadings in formulating rubber compound. Aromatic oil has disadvantages in that, it is hazardous to environment, toxic and has been labeled as carcinogenic. In this research, an <b>epoxidised</b> <b>oil</b> (EO) and {{aromatic oil}} were used to investigate the effect incorporation of oil onto the SBR/NR natural rubber vulcanizates (NR). From the result obtained, EO showed shorter cure time and scorch time as the oil loading were increased up to 20 pphr of EO. Physical properties such as hardness and rebound resilience of NR/EO vulcanisate were also investigated upon exposure to different humidity level in humidity chamber. At room temperature, the hardness of EO loading onto the SBR/NR vulcanisate is lower than AO loadings. Hardness was slightly decreased with increasing rate of humidity. There is great difference in hardness and rebound resilience values between AO and EO. Both hardness and rebound resilience were not affected by humidity. This implies the existence of good filler interaction with EO and rubber which do not impart changes in the hardness and resilience properties of rubber compound. <b>Epoxidised</b> <b>oil</b> has great promising potential to replace the carcinogenic aromatic oil as it has good overall performance and renewable in nature...|$|E
30|$|Oxygen in an epoxide ring can be {{attacked}} by acid causing {{the opening of}} the ring and the formation of a hydroxyl species and a carbocation (Chiniwalla et al. 2003). Crosslinking can occur when the oxygen of an epoxide group is attacked by a carbocation (Chiniwalla et al. 2003). A naturally epoxidised vegetable oil, vernonia oil, employed in formulations of alkyd and epoxy coating, consists of a triacylglycerol of vernolic (cis- 12, 13 -epoxy-cis- 9 -octadecenoic) acid. It contains one epoxy ring and one double bond separated by a single methylene group in each acid chain (Muturi et al. 1994. The epoxidation process increases the viscosity of the oil. The fully <b>epoxidised</b> <b>oil</b> possesses no double bonds therefore it cannot dry further (Muturi et al. 1994). Oligomeric cobalt complexes have been utilised as catalysts for hydrolysis of epoxides compounds, causing {{the opening of the}} epoxide ring to form hydroxyl compounds (Ready & Jacobsen 2002).|$|E
40|$|Synthesis of polyene for {{development}} of conductive coating involves new research area. Hence, this study was aimed to produce the polyene itself from polyvinylchloride (PVC) and disperse into a sustainable oil matrix as coating. Effect of dechlorination of PVC employing different reaction time and conditions were studied. Synthesized polyene formed upon dechlorination process via chemical method was characterized before the polyene powders were dispersed in <b>epoxidised</b> <b>oil</b> (EO) which acts as binder for coating on glass substrate. All polyene powders were then doped with 5 % percent of potassium iodide (KI) and the highest value of conductivity was selected to be doped with 10 %, 20 % and 30 % of KI. Thermal characterization via thermal gravimetry analysis and differential scanning calorimetry analysis were also performed to determine the properties of polyene after the dechlorination. For the polyene coated film, conductivity test, UV/Visible and energy band gap determination and wettability study were characterized. Wettability properties of polyene coated layer onto glass slide were determined by performing contact angle test. Based on the elemental analysis by energydispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), it is shown that a maximum about 95 % of chlorine was eliminated after 2 hours reaction time of dechlorination process. Existence of conjugated bond and effect of doping onto polyene were proven through fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and polyene index. As for polyene powder/ modified EO coated film, sample with 2 hours reaction time showed optimum value of conductivity before and after doped with 5 % KI with the value of 1. 92 x 10 ¯³ Scm¯¹ and 3. 37 x 10 ¯³ Scm¯¹ respectively. Hence, in {{the second stage of}} analysis, the 2 hours sample was chosen to be doped with 10 %, 20 % and 30 % of KI for analysis of doping effect on conductivity. Based on UV/Vis analysis, the wavelength of maximum absorbance was found to have various absorption peaks due to the different existence of chain conjugation phenomena. UV wavelength absorbance peak values give energy band gap relation and can thus be calculated. Wettability properties of polyene coated layer onto glass slide were also performed to determine the contact angle of film...|$|E

The effect of contact with can coatings, sealing gaskets and the <b>epoxidised</b> <b>oils</b> used in gasket manufacture on furan formation was studied. The objective was to identify factors affecting furan formation. Furan present in heat-processed food samples persisted during cooking. Furan was shown to form in foods on heating, although it did not accumulate to a significant degree on heating in an open vessel. There were no interactions between foods and cans, can coatings or gaskets that had a significant influence on furan formation. Furan accumulated particularly in heat-processed canned and jarred foods because they are sealed containers that receive a considerable thermal load. Heating <b>epoxidised</b> <b>oils</b> used in sealing gaskets formed furan.

Traditional stabilizers, for instance Ca/Zn-stearate have been evaluated as well as metal carboxylates regarding yellowness index and UV-Vis absorption. Among the metal carboxylates, a decrease in initial discolouration, i. e. yellowness was observed with addition of Zn-stearate whereas the addition of Al-stearate improved the colour after ageing compared to PVC-ESBO without stabilizer. The stabilizing mechanism of ESBO itself, without the addition of stabilizers, has also been investigated.

40|$|The {{majority}} of work presented covers an investigation in to vegetable oil based monomers {{for use in}} low ‘volatile organic compounds’ (VOC) or VOC free paints. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to recent EU legislation into the reduction of VOCs {{in a wide variety}} of paints and coatings. This is followed by an overview of vegetable oil based chemistry and subsequently the use of vegetable oils within materials, specifically coatings. Chapter 2 discusses the synthesis of a selection of vegetable oil derived monomers using a number of different diamines and aminoalcohols to produce fatty amides with methacrylate, styrene and maleate functionalisation. A selection of 3 vegetable oils with varying degrees of unsaturation (soybean oil, rapeseed oil and cocoa butter) were trialled to see the effect the starting oil had on the subsequent monomers. Removal of some or all of the unsaturation within the fatty chains of the triglycerides and monomers was carried out, primarily as a way to potentially reduce yellowing often found in paints derived from a vegetable oil source. Chapter 3 introduces the technique of emulsion polymerisation, followed by the incorporation of a selection of the methacrylate monomers synthesised in the previous chapter into polymer latexes. Comparisons of the latex properties are made and the results of a variety of tests (DSC, MFFT, hardness, yellowing ability) described. Comparisons between unsaturated and epoxidised derivatives are made and conclusions drawn. Chapter 4 focuses on the preparation of polyurethanes (PU) from a small library of renewable diols. These were synthesised using both cocoa butter and rapeseed oil with diethanolamine, followed by epoxidation of the residual unsaturation in some cases. These were reacted with MDI and a variety of commercial diols (PEGs and 1, 4 -butanediol) and their physical properties (tensile strength, Young’s modulus, swelling and cross-linking density) and thermal properties analysed by a variety of methods (TGA, DSC).

40|$|<b>Epoxidised</b> soybean <b>oil,</b> ESBO, is a {{well known}} {{additive}} used in plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) since it functions both as plasticizer and as stabilizer. This paper describes {{what happens to the}} material when ESBO is used as primary plasticizer in plastisol- and in suspension PVC without any additional stabilizer. When 50 ph ESBO was added to 100 ph plastisol PVC and then aged in a Werner Mathis oven at 180 degrees C for various lengths of time, the E-modulus increased with ageing time due the formation of a crosslinked network induced by a polymerization reaction of the epoxy groups in the ESBO. The network and the PVC were analyzed by NMR which showed that reaction between PVC and ESBO had occurred, and that the network consisted primarily of ESBO. The same experiment performed with suspension PVC instead of plastisol PVC did not result in any crosslinking of the ESBO. The ring opening of the epoxy which starts the polymerization of ESBO is most likely catalyzed by an additive used in the polymerization of plastisol PVC. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, the commercialisation of the developed manufacturing process may be frustrated by a patent that was filed by the Procter and Gamble company while the present project was still running.

Of the steps in the reaction it is postulated that the formation of PA is rate limiting, while the epoxidation occurs comparatively fast negating the requirement for an additional homogenous model. The diffusion steps in the reaction are also ignored in the kinetic model as it is believed that their effects are negligible due to intensive mixing in the batch reactor.

Preparation Samples were prepared with different percentage in weight of sawdust and SLG. The two main sizes of sawdust used were 600 and 1650 microns. Percentage of SLG was varied as well as sawdust. The composite was subjected to preparation that includes weighing, mixing, curing, cutting to sizes and polishing. Curing was done {{at room temperature for}} 24 hours followed by 4 hours of 80 degrees Celsius in an industrial oven. Methodology: Three main tests were used in the investigation of the composite properties. The tests were flexural, impact fracture toughness and DMA analysis. Each of these tests was adopted to determine different expects of the mechanical, physical and structural properties. Both flexural and Impact fracture toughness tests were carried out using MTS alliance provided by CEEFC. The properties investigate in this methods include flexural modulus, peak load, peakstress, deflection and strain at failure. Samples specimen for flexural and impact toughness were made of bar shape with dimensions of 64 x 15 x 10 mm according MTS alliance specifications. DMA samples were smaller made according Q 800 specifications of 35 x 12 x 4 mm. DMA was used to determine thermal mechanical properties. The thermal properties determined were glass transition temperature (Tg), storage modulus, and tan delta. Results and Conclusion: Results obtained for the samples for flexural revealed flexural modulus of up to 1880 MPa for composite with sawdust and SLG in its composition. Composites samples with ELO have lower flexural modulus as compare to ones without ELO. The trend observed was that when more sawdust was added to the composite, storage, peak load, and flexural modulus increased up to a certain limit at which they drop. Addition of more sawdust was observed to lower deflections of composite bars. The result from various combinations of epoxy resin and waste material was compared to the one for the pure or neat epoxy resin. It was found that with addition of ELO, the physical, mechanical and structural properties were much lower compared with the neat epoxy resin properties...|$|R
40|$|In {{our efforts}} {{to create a more}} {{sustainable}} society, several researchers have tried to prepare composites from renewable materials in recent years. The use of natural fibres for reinforcement of composites has been relatively well studied. To date, most studies of natural fibre-reinforced composites have either involved the use of conventional thermoset resins or thermoplastic biopolymers. While there are currently several thermoplastic polymers on the market that are produced from renewable resources, thermosets are inevitably produced from petroleum resources. The development of biobased thermoset resins is therefore of considerable importance. Such resins could be used in future for composite applications, for coating applications or in adhesives. This thesis describes the development of biobased thermoset resins for composite applications. Thermoset resins were synthesised from both <b>epoxidised</b> soybean <b>oils</b> as well as from lactic acid. These resins have been characterised neat as well as together with various reinforcements. The main objective has been to study these biobased resins together with natural fibres for reinforcement, though to some extent nano-reinforcements and glass fibres have also been used as reinforcements. Natural fibre-reinforced composites were prepared from several different biobased thermoset resins. Resins based on soybean oil as well as a resin based on lactic acid were evaluated. The soybean resins were prepared by introducing acrylate or methacrylate groups into the molecules of soybean oil. The second type of thermoset resin used was based on lactic acid. This resin consists of star-shaped methacrylated oligomers of lactic acid. Natural fibres were impregnated by several impregnation techniques. Composites were prepared from the biobased resins together with various natural fibres, such as flax and hemp fibres. The resulting composites were evaluated by tensile testing, flexural testing, impact testing, DMTA and SEM. The results show that composites prepared from biobased resin have relatively good mechanical properties and can be used for indoor applications such as furniture and construction elements...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{illustrates}} {{the development of}} tailor-made, partially hydrated skin adhesive hydrogels {{as a vehicle for}} the topical delivery of moisturising agents. Maintaining an optimum hydration level of the stratum corneum ensures that the barrier properties of the skin are preserved. An unsaturated ionic monomer 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropanesulfonic acid sodium salt, glycerol, water, a photoinitiator Irgacure 184 and crosslinker Ebacryl II facilitated the production of monophasic sheet skin adhesives using photopolymerisation. The exploration and modification of the hydrogel components coupled with their influence on the adhesive and dynamic mechanical behaviour {{led to the development of}} novel monophasic and biphasic hydrogels. Biphasic pregels comprising of a hydrophobic monomer (<b>epoxidised</b> soybean <b>oil</b> acrylate, lauryl acrylate or stearyl acrylate) micellised with a non ionic surfactant Tween 60 allowed a homogeneous distribution throughout a predominantly hydrophilic phase (2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropanesulfonic acid sodium salt, 4 -acryloylmorpholine, glycerol and water). Further development of biphasic hydrogel technology led to the incorporation of preformed commercial O/W emulsions (Acronal, Flexbond 150, DM 137 or Texicryl 13056 WB) allowing the hydrophobic component to be added without prior stabilisation. The topical release of moisturising agents 2 -pyrrolidone- 5 -carboxylic acid, lactobionic acid and d-calcium pantothenate results in the deposition onto the skin by an initial burst mechanism. The hydration level of the stratum corneum was measured using a Comeometer CM 825, Skin Reader MY 810 or FT-ATR. The use of hydrophilic actives in conjunction with lipophilic agents for example Vitamin E or Jojoba oil provided an occlusive barrier, which reduced the rate of transepidermal water loss. The partition coefficients of the release agents provided invaluable information which enabled the appropriate gel technology to be selected. In summary the synthetic studies led to the understanding and generation of transferable technology. This enabled the synthesis of novel vehicles allowing an array of actives with a range of solubilities to be incorporated...|$|R
40|$|Bio-based {{thermoset}} composites {{were prepared}} from <b>epoxidised</b> linseed <b>oil</b> (ELO) using bio-derived crosslinkers. The use of Pripol 1009 (a {{dimerised fatty acid}} derived from natural oils and fats) as a crosslinker yielded homogenous transparent films. The inclusion of catalysts, in particular, 4 -dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), demonstrated a significant improvement in the mechanical properties of the resins. An infrared spectroscopic study coupled with modulated differential scanning calorimetry revealed the epoxide ring opening, followed by etherification occurred during the curing process. The optimum DMAP catalyst loading was 0. 5 - 1 % {{with respect to the}} total resin weight. The optimised formulation consisting of ELO, Pripol and DMAP were subsequently combined with starch or modified starch in order to improve the resin properties. Normal corn starch, high amylose corn starch and their acid hydrolysed derivatives were included in the formulation. The addition of starch improved the mechanical properties of the films with high amylose starch yielding a film with the most desirable properties. Expansion of high amylose corn starch (gelatinisation and retrogradation) yielded a high surface area material. The formulation with 20 % wt. of gelatinised starch yielded a film with 227 % improvement in tensile strength and 166 % enhancement in Young’s modulus, compared to those with no added starch. Moreover, expanded starch granules uniformly dispersed in the polymer matrix, resulting in a complete disappearance of phase separation. This was attributed to better interfacial adhesion of porous expanded starch and the polymer matrix. Thermal analysis revealed retardation in the cure process in the presence of starch, however the hydroxyl groups of starch were likely to enhance the extent of curing, as indicated by the higher total enthalpy of reaction. Furthermore, these bio-based composites demonstrated excellent thermal stability. Esterification of expanded starch dramatically decreased the water uptake of the resins however, the mechanical properties were compromised, owing to low thermal stability of the esterified starch.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the fabrication of novel green materials using nanocellulose as the building block. Bacterial cellulose (BC) {{was used as}} the nanocellulose predominantly in this work. BC is highly crystalline pure cellulose with an inherent fibre diameter in the nano-scale. A single BC nanofibre was found to possess a Young’s modulus of 114 GPa. All these properties are highly favourable for using BC as a nanofiller/reinforcement in green nanocomposite materials. In this work, the surface of BC was rendered hydrophobic by grafting organic acids with various aliphatic chain lengths. These surface-modified BC was used as nanofiller for poly(L-lactide) (PLLA). Direct wetting measurements showed that the BC nanofibre-PLLA interface was improved due to the hydrophobisation of BC with organic acids. This led to the production of BC reinforced PLLA nanocomposites with improved tensile properties. Nanocellulose can also be obtained by grinding of wood pulp, producing nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC). The surface and bulk properties of one type of NFC and BC were compared in this work. Furthermore, the reinforcing ability of NFC and BC was also studied and it was observed that there is {{no significant difference in the}} mechanical performance of NFC or BC reinforced nanocomposites. A novel method based on slurry dipping to coat sisal fibres with BC was developed to modify the surface of natural fibres. This method can produce either (i) a densely BC coating layer or (ii) “hairy” BC coated sisal fibres. Randomly oriented short BC coated sisal fibre reinforced hierarchical composites were manufactured. It was found that hierarchical (nano) composites containing BC coated sisal fibres and BC dispersed in the matrix were required to produce composites with improved mechanical properties. This slurry dipping method was also extended to produce robust short sisal fibre preforms. By infusing this preform with a bio-based thermosetting resin followed by curing, green composites with significantly improved mechanical properties were produced. BC was also used as stabiliser and nano-filler for the production of macroporous polymers made by frothing of acrylated <b>epoxidised</b> soybean <b>oil</b> followed by microwave curing.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the production of}} two types of hierarchical macroporous polymers using the emulsion templating technique. The first are those with a hierarchy of macroporous, defined as the efficient packing of pores with multi-modal pore size distributions. The second are macroporous polymers containing a hierarchical particulate network, defined by an interconnected particle network within the polymer matrix. In {{the first section of}} the thesis, macroporous hierarchy was achieved using 3 different methods. In the first method, the properties of surfactant stabilised high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) were optimised by varying selected emulsification parameters such as the surfactant concentration and stirring rate. The Finite Element Method (FEM) was subsequently used to qualitatively compare and validate the effect of pore hierarchy on the Young’s modulus of macroporous polymers. It was believed that the hierarchical arrangement of macropores facilitated the load transfer during compression, which improved its mechanical properties. The second method involved the use of a mixed surfactant and particle emulsifier system to prepare w/o HIPEs. The mixture of surfactants and particles in the emulsion produced synergistic effects which resulted in a hierarchical macroporous arrangement after polymerisation. The hierarchical porous materials prepared using this method showed high gas permeabilities while maintaining high crush strengths and Young’s moduli compared to ‘conventional’ poly(merised) HIPEs. The improvement in mechanical strength despite the high interconnectivity was attributed to the efficient packing of macropores in a hierarchical configuration. The third approach was to mechanically-froth viscous air in w/o emulsion templates. A bio-based monomer, acrylated <b>epoxidised</b> soyabean <b>oil</b> (AESO) was chosen as a component of the continuous phase of the emulsion for its high viscosity and ability to trap air bubbles during mechanical frothing. Medium Internal Phase Emulsions (MIPEs) containing varying concentrations of AESO were mechanically frothed to incorporate air bubbles, prior to polymerisation. This was found to generate a multi-modal distribution of droplets and air bubbles which polymerised into hierarchical foams with high porosities of up to 81...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{modified}} {{plant oils}} as a renewable feedstock in {{the chemical industry}} has become more desirable as we move towards a carbon-free society. In particular, epoxidized fatty acid derivatives derived from vegetable sources may be utilized as stabilizers and plasticisers in polymer, as lubricant additives and as constituents of polyurethane foams. Rice bran oil (RBO) is a by-product of the rice milling process (conversion of brown to white rice) and a potentially abundant and inexpensive raw material for such products. The synthesis of a polyol product from rice bran oil (RBO) involves two key reaction steps, namely: epoxidation followed by hydroxylation. This study considers the optimization of the reaction conditions for the second step where <b>epoxidised</b> rice bran <b>oil</b> is converted into a polyol. A response surface methodology was utilized for this optimization task. The hydroxylation reaction was performed in a batch reactor using a mixture of alcohols (methanol and isopropanol) with sulfuric acid as a catalyst. A central composite design, with two variables and two response functions was applied to determine influence of the input variables on reaction yield and product viscosity. The conversion of reaction of epoxidised RBO to product polyol exhibits a quadratic dependence on reaction time and temperature. Optimal condition (maximum polyol yield) was achieved with a reaction time of 126 min at a temperature of 49 oC. ...|$|R
