25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E
500|$|The presidential {{election}} of 1832 was approaching, and Floyd was torn: He {{wanted to see}} Vice President Calhoun as the presidential candidate, but wondered if he should first be proposed as the vice presidential candidate for the second term. He felt Calhoun had {{a better chance to}} beat Jackson than Clay, and he wrote to Calhoun in April 1831 to know his opinion: [...] "Under all these views I really do not know which course to take; whether to announce you a candidate for the presidency and take the hazard of war, or wait the fate of Clay. We would be <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> your opinion about these things." [...] Floyd, along with Tazewell and John Tyler, were considered the leaders of the Virginians that had become disaffected with Jackson and had turned to Calhoun. They felt that Jackson had repudiated [...] "virtue and ability as well as Old Republican tenets." [...] According to historian Stephen Oates, [...] "In Floyd's opinion, the federal government under [...] "King Andrew" [...] had usurped power left and right, thus allowing the majority to run roughshod over the minority." ...|$|E
500|$|In the US, {{the film}} was not subject to any {{censorship}} at all, and was released virtually intact to AIP's usual mix of drive-ins and grindhouses. However, {{in an attempt to}} link the film with Roger Corman's earlier Edgar Allan Poe series of films, it was retitled The Conqueror Worm. Brief prologue and epilogue narrations (by Price) taken from Poe's poem were added to justify the new title. As Danny Peary noted in his Cult Movies book, the film went nearly unnoticed by critics during its US release: [...] "The few snoozing trade reviewers who saw it treated it as just another entry in AIP's Edgar Allan Poe series... and gave it such dismal notices that future bookings were scarce." [...] Hollywood Citizen News was appalled by the film: [...] "A disgrace to the producers and scripters, and a sad commentary on the art of filmmaking... a film with such bestial brutality and orgiastic sadism, one wonders how it ever passed customs to be released in this country." [...] The trade journal Box Office noted that: [...] "Fans of the horror film will be <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that Vincent Price is back to add another portrait to his gallery of arch-fiends... bathed in the most stomach-churning gore imaginable..." [...] Variety opined that [...] "Dwyer gives evidence of acting talent, but she and all principals are hampered by Michael Reeves's mediocre script and ordinary direction." [...] Despite the lack of critical support, the movie was a modest success stateside, earning $1.5 million for AIP according to Cinefantastique magazine. In his biography of Reeves, Benjamin Halligan claims the film made $10 million in the US.|$|E

2500|$|The Court told four {{students}} to consider applying for admission {{in a year}} or more. Initially Lowell opposed all such applications. Greenough expressed frustration with his stance and eventually won readmission for Gilkey and Lumbard. He expressed especial frustration that Lowell would not readmit Day. Informing Day that he could not return to Harvard, Greenough could only offer personal reflections and assurances: [...] "Two points, however, I beg you to bear in mind. First, the chief thing in this world is to do right and be of service, whether at Harvard or outside. I know that you will keep on trying wherever you are. Secondly, please remember that if there is ever anything I can personally do to help you, I shall be <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> it and to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nilsson {{was known}} for {{standing}} up to conductors. In a 1967 rehearsal of Die Walküre with Herbert von Karajan conducting, Nilsson responded to the gloomy lighting of the production by wearing a miner's helmet (complete with Valkyrian wings). When on some occasion von Karajan urged a retake [...] "and this time with our hearts – that's where your wallet has its place", Nilsson replied, [...] "I'm <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that we {{have at least one}} thing in common, Maestro von Karajan!" [...] When Georg Solti, in Tristan und Isolde, insisted on tempos too slow for Nilsson's taste, she made the first performance even slower, inducing a conductorial change of heart. After a tiff with Hans Knappertsbusch, Nilsson reported: [...] "He called me by a name that begins with [...] "A" [...] and ends with 'hole'".|$|E

2500|$|... "On {{the stage}} sat four Indian men, {{one of whom}} was Sitting Bull. [...] There were two women and two {{children}} with them. [...] A white man came on stage and introduced Sitting Bull as the man who had killed General Custer (which, of course, was absolutely false). [...] Sitting Bull arose and addressed the audience in the Sioux tongue, as he did not speak nor understand English. [...] He said, ‘My friends, white people, we Indians are on our way to Washington to see the Grandfather, or President of the United States. [...] I see so many white people and what they are doing, that it makes me <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that some day my children will be educated also. [...] There is no use fighting any longer. [...] The buffalo are all gone, as well {{as the rest of the}} game. [...] Now I am going to shake the hand of the Great Father at Washington, and I am going to tell him all these things.’ Then Sitting Bull sat down. He never even mentioned General Custer’s name.|$|E
