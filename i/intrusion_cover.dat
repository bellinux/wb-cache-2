40|$|The {{geologic}} {{mapping of}} Limnos (northern Aegean Sea-Greece) at scale 1. 50, 000 has allowed a new interpretation of its stratigraphic and tectonic evolution. The oldest {{part of the}} island consists of sedimentary deposits with ages ranging from middle Eocene (Lutetian) to early Miocene(?). Sandstone petrography indicates that the detritus is mainly composed by clasts of low-to-medium-grade metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, deriving from Rhodope Massif and Circum-Rhodope belt. During the late Oligocene and early Miocene, the sedimentary sequence was gently folded, eroded, and then covered by mainly continental sediments. Relatively intense magmatism started in early Miocene with pyroclastic flows followed by the emplacement of sills, lava flows and domes; three volcanic units, as well as a quartz-monzonite of limited extent (Fakos <b>intrusion),</b> <b>cover</b> much of the southwestern {{part of the island}}. K/Ar radiometric ages indicate that these rocks formed between 22 and 18 Ma. They have an orogenic affinity and relatively evolved compositions, with high-K dacites dominating over high-K andesites, latites and trachytes. The Limnos igneous rocks represent the first products in the North Aegean area, where the volcanic activity ceased in the middle Miocene. The Eocene to Miocene sedimentary succession exposed on the Island of Limnos reflects the geodynamic relations between the Serbo-Macedonian-Rhodope Massif, and the closure of Pindo (Subpelagonian) oceanic crust subducted at least from the Late Cretaceous under the European margin represented by the amalgamated units belonging to Rhodope-Vardar-Pelagonian zone...|$|E

40|$|Newly {{acquired}} aeromagnetic {{data indicate}} {{the presence of a}} dike swarm that may have acted as a magma transport and feeder system from the plume impact site up to 3, 500 km to the Ferrar Large Igneous Province (FLIP).

Prior to this survey, no feeder dike swarms or sills connecting with the Ferrar have been found in the Pensacola Mountains. Similarities with the Mackenzie dikes and intrusions of Northwest Canada imply that Jurassic dikes may have been emplaced into the pre-existing Ross orogeny trend during doming above a mantle plume. However, our survey area is too small to show the dikes convincingly radiating from a focal point that would indicate the plume position. ...|$|R

40|$|The central {{thesis is}} that when the costs of {{transacting}} are low, the legal system will gravitate toward rules that determine entitlements at a low cost [...] such as the strict liability rule of trespass. The combination of low transaction costs and low entitlement-determination costs will maximize the extent to which conflicts between competing uses of land can be resolved by market transactions. In contrast, when the costs of transacting are apt to be high, the legal system will incline toward rules for the determination of entitlements that are more expensive [...] such as the balancing or cost-benefit approach of nuisance. When market mechanisms fail, these more expensive entitlement-determination rules are necessary in order to give judges the needed discretion to adopt what they perceive as the best "compromise" solution (the efficient solution) to land use disputes. Although I will use this economic model primarily to explain the differences between trespass and nuisance and the sorts of <b>intrusions</b> <b>covered</b> by each action, the model has the potential for broader application. In Section IV, I will survey some other issues involving the rights to exclude, use, and transfer property and will suggest that the relationship between transaction costs and entitlement-determination costs can account for some of the legal doctrine in these areas. Finally, although the main thrust of the article is positive in its orientation, in Section V I will raise some normative issues for those who believe that the legal system should be concerned, at least in part, with the maximization of social utility or wealth. Here, I argue that low-cost mechanical entitlement-determination rules {{play an important role in}} facilitating the exchange and modification of property rights [...] a role often overlooked by commentators who view them simply as decisional rules to be applied in litigation...|$|R

Of the 14 planned map sheets at 1 : 500 000 which will cover all of Greenland, 11 have been published, and one addi-tional sheet for which field {{work has been}} completed is under compilation. Only two areas of Greenland are not yet covered by map sheets of this series: part of North-West Greenland (sheet no 6) and the target for the present project in North-East Greenland (sheet no. 11). The field work for the latter sheet is planned for two seasons, with the first season completed in 1997 and the second and final season to follow in 1998. The map sheet (no. 11) covers the region between Kong Oscar Fjord and the Stauning Alper in the south (72 °N) and Kuhn Ø and Grandjean Fjord in the north (75 °N, Fig. 1). The western part of this region is dom-inated by crystalline complexes of the East Greenland Caledonian fold belt.

We carried out salinity intrusion experiment to which model ice-sheet floats on the water surface and one-dimensional two-layered unsteady flow calculation. In this experiment, the vertical flow velocity was measured using particle image velosimetry technique. In the experiment in which ice-sheet exists, the model ice-sheet indirectly attenuated the salinity intrusion because Reynolds number does not become large. Shear stress was computed by having assigned the experiment data to one-dimensional two-layered unsteady flow equation. In both ice and no-ice condition, Interface shear stress has large influence on salinity intrusion.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{improved}} density model {{and a new}} structural map of the Neapolitan Yellow Tuff caldera, the active portion of the nested Campi Flegrei caldera. The model was built using a new 3 -D inversion of the available high-precision gravity data, and a new digital terrain and marine model. The inversion procedure, based on a variable-depth lumped assembling of the subsurface gravity distribution via cell aggregation, gives better defined insights into the internal caldera architecture, that well agree with the available geological, geophysical, and geochemical data. The adopted 3 -D gravity method is highly efficient for characterizing the shallow caldera structure (down to 3 km depth) and defining features related to regional or volcano tectonic lineaments and dynamics. In particular, the resulting density distribution highlights a pronounced density low in correspondence of the central portion of the caldera with a detail not available till now. The joint interpretation of the available data suggests a subsurface structural setting that supports a piecemeal collapse of the caldera, and allows the identification of its headwall. Positive gravity anomalies localize dense <b>intrusions</b> (presently <b>covered</b> by late volcanic deposits) along the caldera marginal faults, and the main structural lineaments both bordering the resurgent block and cutting the caldera floor. These results allow us to both refine the current geological-structural framework and propose a new structural map that highlights the caldera boundary and its internal setting.

40|$|A core {{component}} of any curriculum in modern information security is {{the security of}} the operating systems that reside on the workstations and servers of a network. Effective information security depends on addressing all facets of how information is stored, moved, and modified.

40|$|International audienceThe Cycladic granitoids (Ikaria, Mykonos, Naxos, Kos, Lavrion, Serifos, Tinos) intruded the Aegean crust {{during a}} rather short period (17 - 10 Ma) {{compared}} to the much longer Oligo-Miocene crustal thinning phase (35 Ma to the Present). Their geochemical characteristics show that their sources have changed through time and space, with a progressive decreasing component of continental crust contamination with time and from east to west. They all interacted with large-scale detachments, namely the North Cycladic Detachment System (NCDS) {{in the north and}} the West Cycladic Detachment System (WCDS) in the south. In Mykonos, Naxos, Serifos and Ikaria the plutons are also associated with a high-temperature metamorphic dome of Miocene age. Their <b>intrusion</b> period roughly <b>covers</b> the same time window as the fast clockwise rotation of the western Aegean evidenced by paleomagnetic measurements and they are contemporaneous with a surge of alkaline volcanism in the eastern Aegean that can be related to a slab tear imaged below western Anatolia. The continental crust component in the Middle Miocene Cycladic plutons is not found in the early Miocene plutons of the northern Aegean, like in Kavala and Vrondou. They thus probably record a quite sudden thermal event in the Cyclades that led to the partial melting of the extending deep crust. We propose a model involving slab tear starting at ~ 17 Ma, fast retreat of the slab west of the tear and southwestward influx of hot asthenospheric material below the Aegean crust, leading to melting of the lower crust. Partial melting of the whole lower crust above the hot asthenospheric flow could explain the flat Moho observed below the Cyclades. The close proximity of plutons with the detachments suggests that their ascent toward the upper crust is favoured by the extreme extension at work there. The first granitoids in the region of the tear (Ikaria) are the richest in crustal component and this component decreases while the crust thins more and more, the youngest plutons being more purely derived from the mantle as for instance Kos and the granitic dyke swarm of Samos...|$|R
40|$|The Mojave-Sonora megashear {{constitutes}} a regional boundary between lithologically distinct Jurassic assemblages of different ages. North of the Mojave-Sonora megashear, arc-related volcanic, volcaniclastic, and clastic rocks, intruded by plutons (175 – 160 Ma) compose {{part of the}} Middle Jurassic (commonly ca. 175 Ma) igneous province, previously recognized in Arizona and California. Distinct domains among Jurassic igneous rocks in northern Sonora are: (1) southern Papago, a region where pre-Jurassic rocks are unknown, (2) Nogales-Cananea-Nacozari, where Jurassic rocks are underlain by 1. 7 – 1. 4 Ga crystalline basement, and (3) Mojave-Sonora, where strata, including Oxfordian beds, along {{the north side of}} the Mojave-Sonora megashear are commonly strongly deformed, as recorded by thrust faults, mylonitic foliation, and recumbent folds. The Mojave-Sonora domain extends across the southwestern margins of the southern Papago and the Nogales-Cananea-Nacozari domains. Strong deformation that distinguishes the zone markedly declines within a few tens of kilometers northward. South of the Mojave-Sonora megashear, in central and southern Sonora, Lower Jurassic clastic and volcaniclastic rocks distinguish the Caborca domain. Upper Jurassic sedimentary rocks, commonly conglomeratic, are abundant north of Mojave-Sonora megashear; a single occurrence is known south of the Mojave-Sonora megashear. Waning of subduction-related Middle Jurassic magmatism was followed by the abrupt formation, ca. 165 Ma, of Coast Range, Josephine, Great Valley, and Devil's Elbow ophiolites and the Smartville Complex within oceanic pull-aparts west of the margin of the North America plate. The formation of ophiolitic rocks signaled the beginning of transtensional faulting. Almost contemporaneously (ca. 163 Ma) the lowest volcanic units and overlying coarse sedimentary beds began to accumulate in fault-bounded continental pull-apart basins such as the McCoy Mountains basin. Other transtensional basins, formed at releasing steps where pull-aparts formed, are well developed within the Papago domain and other parts of southwestern United States and northern Mexico. From Sonora northward into California the Mojave-Sonora megashear fault zone, developed generally within the Middle Jurassic arc-parallel to the former continental margin, is inferred to link with strands of the Melones and Bear Mountain faults of the Foothills fault system, the Wolf Creek fault, and the Big Bend fault. A protuberance of Proterozoic basement (the Caborca block) that was truncated from the continental margin records ∼ 800 – 1000 km of left-lateral offset. The displacement of the Caborca block took place south of a major releasing step along the Big Bend fault with the result that a regional pull-apart that coincides with the Great Valley of California developed. Inboard of the Mojave-Sonora megashear Late Jurassic magmatic rocks crop out near faults at some releasing steps and within floors of some pull-apart structures. The distribution suggests that magma rose along faults and into areas of thin crust. In southern Arizona these igneous rocks are included as part of the Artesa layered sequence and the Ko Vaya plutonic suite. Oxfordian and younger beds, which crop out north of the Mojave-Sonora megashear may contain exotic blocks and contractional structures that are contemporaneous with the Nevadan orogeny. The variation in the style and intensity of deformation of Middle and Upper Jurassic strata, and Upper Jurassic conglomerate rich in clasts derived from rocks of the Caborca domain, are postulated to record transpression near the Mojave-Sonora megashear that locally overlapped the more widespread transtensional structures in time and space. The cessation of strike-slip faulting locally began ca. 150 Ma, as shown by undeformed intrusive bodies that cut older deformed Middle Jurassic rocks. By the time that the Independence dikes and correlative rocks were emplaced at 148 Ma, scant evidence of lateral faulting is known. <b>Intrusions,</b> young volcanic <b>cover,</b> transecting strike-slip faults, and multiple generations of low-angle extensional and contractional faults obscure Jurassic structures in Sonora and southern California. Despite these complications, removal of the effects of superposed structures reveals a viable trace for an inferred Late Jurassic left-lateral fault linking the Mojave-Sonora megashear and more northerly fault segments. The position of this major inferred fault is constrained by distinctive tectonostratigraphic domains. The Middle and Late Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous plate tectonic history includes (1) subduction (175 – 165 Ma), (2) coupling (ca. 165 Ma), (3) rifting, transtension, lateral faulting, transpression, and contraction (165 – 145 Ma), and (4) renewed subduction (ca. 135 Ma) along the western margin of the North America plate and terranes (e. g., Wrangellia) to the west. The structures that record the diverse plate processes and that are preserved best in the overriding North America plate are compatible with a consistently maintained easterly directed maximum compressive stress...|$|R
