40|$|Abstract—In medical shape analysis, a {{critical}} problem is reconstructing a smooth surface of correct topology from a binary mask that typically has spurious features due to segmentation artifacts. The challenge is the robust removal of these outliers without affecting {{the accuracy of}} {{other parts of the}} boundary. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for this problem based on the Laplace–Beltrami (LB) eigen-projection and properly designed boundary deformations. Using the metric distortion during the LB eigen-projection, our method automatically detects the location of outliers and feeds this information to a well-composed and topology-preserving deformation. By iterating between these two steps of outlier detection and boundary deformation, we can robustly filter out the outliers without moving the smooth part of the boundary. The final surface is the eigen-projection of the filtered mask boundary that has the correct topology, desired accuracy and smoothness. In our experiments, we illustrate the robustness of our method on different <b>input</b> <b>masks</b> of the same structure, and compare with the popular SPHARM tool and the topology preserving level set method to show that our method can reconstruct accurate surface representations without introducing artificial oscillations. We also successfully validate our method on a large data set of more than 900 hippocampal masks and demonstrate that the reconstructed surfaces retain volume information accurately.

The occlusion may be from different objects like sunglasses, mufflers, masks, scarves etc. Sometimes, this occlusion is used by the criminal persons to hide their identity from the surroundings. In this thesis, a technique is used to detect the facial occlusion automatically. After detecting the occluded areas, a method for image reconstruction called aPCA (asymmetrical Principal Component Analysis) is used to reconstruct the faces. The entire face is reconstructed using the non occluded area of the face. A database of images of different persons is organized which is used in the process of reconstruction of the occluded images. Experiments were performed to examine the effect of the granularity of the occlusion on the aPCA reconstruction process. The <b>input</b> <b>mask</b> image is divided into different parts, the occlusion for each part is marked and aPCA is applied to reconstruct the faces.

Existing techniques blur the important parts of image sequences, such as catheter tips, anatomical structures and organs; and they may introduce trailing artifacts. To address this concern, an adaptive filtering process is presented to apply temporal filtering in regions without motion and spatial filtering in regions with motion. The adaptive filtering process is a multi-step procedure. First a normalized motion mask that describes the differences between two successive frames is generated. Secondly each frame is spatially filtered using the specific motion mask to specify different types of filtering in each region. Third an IIR filter is then used to combine the spatially filtered image with the previous output image; the motion mask thus serves as a weighted <b>input</b> <b>mask</b> {{to determine how much}} spatial and temporal filtering should be applied.

LINQ could be the missing link between the world of data {{and the world of}} generally oriented programming languages.

It allows similar querying updating operations as operations that are used in SQL for working with databases. Key aspect of development of LINQ was to provide a unified programming model that could be used with all types of objects and data sources as well as simplifying reading from these sources. Such an approach lets you use all languages supported in the. NET framework languages on different data sources in the same way.

Earlier physiological studies showed that IT neurons have large receptive fields covering the center and contralateral (often bilateral) visual fields, stimulus selectivity for images of complex objects or shapes, and translation invariance of the stimulus selectivity. Recent studies have revealed new aspects of their properties such as invariant selectivity for shapes despite drastic changes in various physical attributes of stimuli, latent excitatory <b>inputs</b> <b>masked</b> by stimulus-specific GABAergic inhibition, selectivity for binocular disparity and 3 -dimensional surface structures, profound effects of learning on the stimulus selectivity, and columnar clustering of neurons with similar stimulus selectivity for shapes and other object features. Another line of research using histological techniques have revealed that pyramidal neurons in the IT are larger in the size of dendritic arbors, in the number of dendritic branches and spines, and in the size and distribution of horizontal axonal arbors than those in the earlier areas, allowing them to integrate a larger population of afferents and process more diverse inputs.
