40|$|PURPOSE: To report {{indications}} of new visual function after retinal transplantation <b>in</b> two blind <b>patients</b> with retinitis pigmentosa. METHODS: Intact sheets of fetal retina (15 and 17 weeks gestational age) were transplanted subretinally (between the neurosensory retina and the retinal pigment epithelium) near the fovea {{in the left}} eye of a 23 -year-old white man (<b>Patient</b> A) and <b>in</b> the left eye of a 72 -year-old white woman (Patient B), both with autosomal-recessive retinitis pigmentosa. RESULTS: Postoperatively, at 6 and 5 months, respectively, both patients reported new visual sensation in the visual field corresponding to the transplant. <b>In</b> both <b>patients,</b> the visual sensation continued to be present after transplantation, at 12 and 8 months, respectively. <b>In</b> <b>Patient</b> A, a transient multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) response was observed in the transplant area 4 months postoperatively but was not detectable <b>in</b> <b>Patient</b> A at 6. 0 and 9. 5 months post–retinal transplantation. <b>In</b> <b>Patient</b> B, no positive mfERG responses were seen up to 5 months postoperatively.
