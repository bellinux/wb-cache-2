30|$|Load control, {{sometimes}} referred to as direct load control programs were the first type of DSM programs to appear in the U.S. During the early 1950 s a number of U.S. Rural Electric Cooperatives installed ripple-type load control systems on consumer electric water heaters. Ripple systems employed a method of communication which enabled the utility to slightly disrupt the AC waveform as a means by which a signal could be sent to disconnect and reconnect the appliances [3]. These Rural Cooperatives typically purchased their wholesale electricity for resale from larger utilities under <b>tariff</b> <b>arrangements</b> which included charges for energy and peak demand. Thus, they often had substantial incentives to reduce peak demand by load control. These programs evolved during the 1960 s and then included electronic control. For example, in 1968 Detroit Edison replaced water heater time clocks with a radio system. Others followed, including Buckeye Power in 1973, Arkansas Power and Light in 1976 and various Kansas and Nebraska utilities utilizing irrigation control in the years immediately following.|$|R

40|$|Using {{confidential}} firm-level {{data from}} the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on activities of U. S. multinational corporations (MNCs) and their Canadian affiliates, we study the dramatic growth of intra-firm and arm's-length U. S. -Canada trade over the 1984 - 95 period. We find that decisions to engage in intra-firm and arm's-length trade are essentially unrelated to tariff and transport cost reductions over this sample period. Thus, {{we find that the}} increase in trade occurred almost entirely on the intensive rather than the extensive margin. This is consistent with case study evidence in Keane and Feinberg (2006), where MNC executives consistently indicate that the modest tariff reductions of the 1984 - 95 period were not sufficient to justify fixed costs of overhauling international supply chains. Our results have important implications for recent influential models of international trade that rely on sensitivity of intra-firm trade to tariffs at the extensive margin to explain how small tariff declines could have led to the explosion of intra-firm trade since the 1980 s. We also find that initial conditions (i. e., 1983 tariffs) are uncorrelated with whether firms engaged in intra-firm or arm's-length trade activity {{at the start of the}} sample period. This result is surprising as it implies that firms/industries with a greater propensity to engage in trade were not, in general, successful at lobbying for more <b>favourable</b> <b>tariff</b> treatment. ...|$|R

Analyzing this set of statistics, this paper argues that the Dutch Outer Islands ports continued to export China-bound (partly Southeast Asia-bound) tropical products, such as pepper, forest products, and other kinds of local products, as well as colonial products such as coffee. On the other hand, these ports imported increasing amounts of British cotton goods after the Anglo-Dutch <b>tariff</b> <b>arrangement</b> in the 1840 s.

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{amount of}} distributed generation (DG) can cause an increase or a decrease on distribution network costs. Tariff design {{is the main}} tool for allocating these costs to customers who own and operate DG resources. Currently, however, either DG units are exempt from paying distribution tariffs or {{they are subject to}} tariffs originally designed according to a traditional pricing model without DG in the grids, also known as load-based pricing. Partial recovery of the allowed distribution company revenue requirements or cross-subsidies between customers may ensue from such <b>tariff</b> <b>arrangements.</b> In this article, pricing, as represented by a combination of net metering and pure volumetric tariffs, is applied in the context of increasing DG. The paper presents a methodology where a Reference Network Model (RNM) is used to investigate the effect of this pricing scheme on the magnitude of cross-subsidies from consumers towards the so-called prosumers for a set of twelve simulations based on real-size networks in the U. S. For the considered scenarios, the analysis reveals substantial cross-subsidies from consumers toward prosumers. The degree of subsidy varies with the amount of DG connected to the grid and network characteristics. The rate of cross-subsidy tends to be higher for low-density grids. This paper contributes to the net metering literature with a quantitative assessment of cross-subsidies by comparing allocated payments to different actors with the costs they impose on the system, estimated through an RNM. Moreover, the paper proposed a tariff structure based on cost causality by proposing a cost-reflective, volumetric tariff approach through which aggregate load-driven and DG-driven network costs are accordingly allocated to loads and DG units.

The optimization algorithm is applied to real-world metered data to quantify the possible investment value of a PV installation under different energy retailers and <b>tariff</b> structures. The <b>arrangement</b> with the highest value is determined to enable prospective small-scale PV investors to select the most cost-effective system.

40|$|Improving {{market access}} in {{industrial}} countries and retaining preferences have been Africa's two key objectives in the Doha Round trade negotiations. This paper argues that African negotiators may have overlooked the potential market access gains in developing countries, where trade barriers remain relatively high {{and demand for}} African imports has expanded substantially over the past decades. As reductions in most-favored-nation tariffs in industrial countries will inevitably lead to preference erosion, African countries need {{to ensure that the}} Doha Round leads to liberalization in all sectors by all World Trade Organization (WTO) members, so that the resulting gains will offset any losses. Such an outcome is more likely if African countries also offer to liberalize their own trade regimes and focus on reciprocal liberalization as a negotiation strategy rather on preferential and differential treatment.

40|$|Congo''s vital {{dependence}} on trade for development stands in contradiction with its trade policy. As {{a member of}} the CEMAC, Congo''s tariff scheme at least formally is guided by CEMAC''s 1994 trade regime agreement. This paper shows CEMAC''s customs code is restrictive relative to that of comparable regional integration groups. The paper also discusses a number of quantitative and qualitative barriers to trade applied by Congo that render its current regime complex, nontransparent, and relatively unpredictable, compromising efforts to develop the non-oil sector and the country''s export base. Moreover, Congo''s high tariffs and other taxes have not led to higher fiscal revenues, as the number of exemptions granted in recent years has surged and customs administration remains weak.

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} {{is to provide a}} {{preliminary}} assessment of the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA) in order to highlight the directions that might take the next stage of reform. A particular focus is made on the Quads countries. Our findings are that, in spite of the URAA <b>arrangements,</b> <b>tariffs</b> on agricultural products are still three times higher on average than on manufactured products. The tariffication process has often led to prohibitive duties and to an increase in tariff dispersion. Tariff rate quotas (TRQs) have not always been filled and market access has shown only limited improvement. Export subsidies still exist and domestic farm policies have often experienced only minor changes to match the Agreement requirements. These points, which have been identified as live issues for the next Round of Negotiations, are then debated {{in the rest of the}} document. We discuss in particular the modalities of ameliorating market access, with the definition of a more effective tariff cut and the improvement of TRQs' administration and efficiency. As far as exports are concerned, we tackle the issue of effectiveness of a new reduction of export subsidies, the status of export credit and of export restrictions. The more general question of state involvement in agricultural trade is also discussed. Finally, we pose the question of a deepening of the reduction of support to agriculture, with an elimination of the "blue box" and a new definition of the "green box" content. support to agriculture., export subsidies, market access, agriculture, trade negotiations, WTO...|$|R
