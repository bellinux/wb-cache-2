Only a few thousand {{were able to get}} into the hall, and 2,000 were standing. Five thousand singers from more than a hundred sängerbunds representing forty cities from New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware competed for a $20,000 prize offered by Kaiser Wilhelm II. Park vendors offered souvenirs, refreshments, games, and a carousel.|$|E

He is {{beginning}} {{to fall in love}} with Aglaya, and she likewise appears to be fascinated by him, though she often mocks or angrily reproaches him for his naiveté and excessive humility. Myshkin joins Lizaveta Prokofyevna, her daughters and Yevgeny Pavlovich for a walk to the park to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>music.</b> While listening to the high-spirited conversation and watching Aglaya in a kind of daze, he notices Rogozhin and Nastassya Filippovna in the crowd. Nastassya Filippovna again addresses herself to Yevgeny Pavlovich, and in the same jolly tone as before loudly informs him that his uncle—a wealthy and respected old man from whom he is expecting a large inheritance—has shot himself and that a huge sum of government money is missing. Yevgeny Pavlovich stares at her in shock as Lizaveta Prokofyevna makes a hurried exit with her daughters. Nastassya Filippovna hears an officer friend of Yevgeny Pavlovich suggest that a whip is needed for women like her, and she responds by grabbing a riding-whip from a bystander and striking the officer across the face with it. He tries to attack her but Myshkin restrains him, for which he is violently pushed. Rogozhin, after making a mocking comment to the officer, leads Nastassya Filippovna away. The officer recovers his composure, addresses himself to Myshkin, politely confirms his name, and leaves.|$|E

500|$|In late 1967, an acetate of {{fourteen}} of Dylan's compositions was made, from which demos circulated among music groups {{who might be}} interested in recording some of the songs. Artists including Peter, Paul and Mary, Manfred Mann and the Byrds eventually did. Dylan's demo tapes were soon heard by music journalists, including Rolling Stones Jann Wenner, who wrote a front-page story in that magazine entitled [...] "Dylan's Basement Tape Should Be Released". This made the general public hungry to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>music,</b> and in July 1969 a bootleg called Great White Wonder, which included some of the Big Pink songs, came out.

500|$|Lennon grew {{concerned}} that fans who attended Beatles concerts {{were unable to}} <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> above the screaming of fans, and that the band's musicianship was beginning to suffer as a result. Lennon's [...] "Help!" [...] expressed his own feelings in 1965: [...] "I meant it... It was me singing 'help'". He had put on weight (he would later refer to this as his [...] "Fat Elvis" [...] period), and felt he was subconsciously seeking change. In March that year he was unknowingly introduced to LSD when a dentist, hosting a dinner party attended by Lennon, Harrison and their wives, spiked the guests' coffee with the drug. When they wanted to leave, their host revealed what they had taken, and strongly advised them not {{to leave the house}} because of the likely effects. Later, in an elevator at a nightclub, they all believed it was on fire: [...] "We were all screaming... hot and hysterical." ...|$|E
500|$|Lightning Bolt {{are known}} for their {{so-called}} [...] "guerrilla gigs", preferring to play {{on the floor of the}} venue rather than the stage, creating a tight circle of spectators around the band. [...] They have also been known to start playing only a few seconds after the opening band finishes, often taking the audience by surprise. However, in 2014 they abandoned the [...] "guerrilla gig" [...] formula because of the majority of a large audience only a small part of it can totally enjoy the show. The rest of the audience can't see the band and can't <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> well. [...] In 2004, Lightning Bolt played on the doorstep of radio DJ John Peel's chalet at noon during the All Tomorrow's Parties festival, about which neighbor Steve Albini of Shellac and Big Black commented [...] "Best alarm clock I've ever had." [...] They have also staged concerts in kitchens, on sidewalks, and in parking lots.|$|E

Throughout March, five rough mixes of songs from the album were leaked. In {{an interview with a}} fansite, Chris Vrenna said of the leak: [...] "I hate stealing of music in any form. If a band chooses to put tracks online, that's great. [...] I think true fans know that usually songs found online before the record is released are rough mixes, and will wait to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> the way the artist intended." [...] "We're from America" [...] was released as a free download on the band's website from March 27, with a one-track digital single released through online retailers on April 7. A CD single was released on April 14, and was exclusively sold at Hot Topic. It peaked at number three on Billboards Hot Singles Sales, spending six weeks on the chart.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant-General Govorov {{ordered a}} {{bombardment}} of German artillery positions {{in advance of}} the concert in a special operation, code-named [...] "Squall". Soviet intelligence personnel had located the German batteries and observation posts a few weeks before, in preparation for the attack. Three thousand high-calibre shells were lobbed onto the enemy. The purpose of the operation was to prevent the Germans from targeting the concert hall and to ensure that it would be quiet enough to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> over speakers he ordered to be set up. He also encouraged Soviet soldiers to listen to the concert via radio. Musicologist Andrei Krukov later praised Govorov's actions as providing the [...] "incentive" [...] for the concert, adding that his choice to allow soldiers to participate was [...] "a quite exceptional decision". Govorov himself later remarked to Eliasberg that [...] "we played our instrument in the symphony, too, you know," [...] in reference to the artillery fire. The military contribution to the affair was not widely known until well after the war ended.|$|E

The opening track [...] "Up in Flames" [...] incorporates a [...] "slow, heavy and melodramatic beat", where Minaj addresses her wealth and delivers negative remarks directed towards her adversaries. The second song [...] "Freedom" [...] was compared to material from her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010); it utilizes minimal production and reflects on Minaj's rise to prominence. The third song [...] "Hell Yeah" [...] features Parker and further criticizes Minaj's opponents. She references her much-publicized on-set tension with fellow American Idol judge Mariah Carey in the line [...] "But I'm quick to check a bitch if she’s outta line" [...] and references the series' personnel in the line [...] "Shout out Mike Darnell and Nigel [...] / Why these bums so mad that the queen on Idol".|$|E

500|$|Blackhill Enterprises {{provided}} a [...] high stage, with the speakers being {{housed in a}} thirty-foot-high tower so that people {{at the far end}} of the park would be able to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>music.</b> The stage was flanked by palm trees in pots and behind the performers there was a blowup of the cover of the Beggars Banquet album. Richards had started experimenting with open tunings by this point in the band's career, particularly after hearing Ry Cooder, and the Hyde Park gig was the first chance audiences got to hear them. He played a Gibson ES-330 tuned to open E tuning with a capo on the fourth fret, and a Gibson Flying V. Taylor, meanwhile, played a Gibson Les Paul for the opening number, followed by an SG for the majority of the set. The PA system was supplied by Watkins Electric Music, who already handled amplification at previous Hyde Park shows. Company founder Charlie Watkins recalls it was the largest PA he had assembled to that point and, unable to provide enough gear himself, he was forced to borrow extras from other groups, later saying, [...] "I didn't have many columns, but I wanted to put 1500W up. I borrowed some from T-Rex. They all chipped in — that's what we used to do." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 May the theatre was packed. Gustav Linor reported, [...] "Never... has the hall been so full, or so resplendent; the {{stairways}} and the corridors were crowded with spectators eager to see and to hear". The evening began with Les Sylphides, in which Nijinsky and Karsavina danced the main roles. The Rite followed. Some eyewitnesses and commentators said that the disturbances in the audience began during the Introduction, and grew in a crescendo when the curtain rose on the stamping dancers in [...] "Augurs of Spring". But music historian Richard Taruskin asserts, [...] "it was not Stravinsky's music that did the shocking. It was the ugly earthbound lurching and stomping devised by Vaslav Nijinsky." [...] Marie Rambert, who was working {{as an assistant to}} Nijinsky, recalled later that it was soon impossible to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> on the stage. In his autobiography, Stravinsky writes that the derisive laughter that greeted the first bars of the Introduction disgusted him, and that he left the auditorium to watch the rest of the performance from the stage wings. The demonstrations, he says, grew into [...] "a terrific uproar" [...] which, along with the on-stage noises, drowned out the voice of Nijinsky who was shouting the step numbers to the dancers. The journalist and photographer Carl Van Vechten recorded that the person behind him got carried away with excitement, and [...] "began to beat rhythmically on top of my head", though Van Vechten failed to notice this at first, his own emotion being so great.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the album}} Untouchables leaking onto the Internet, Take a Look in the Mirror was {{released}} on a Friday, November 21, 2003 – four days earlier than its original release date. The album therefore received a weekend's worth of sales, {{which resulted in a}} poor showing on the Billboard 200. During its first full week, Take a Look in the Mirror soared ten places from number nineteen to number nine, increasing the album's total sales to 179,000. It is the first album self-produced by Korn. The band explained that they wanted fans to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> as it should be. The album presented different styles and themes compared to previous albums. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis related: [...] "The whole album is about love, hate and my hate of people and just losing my mind. The previous albums I did, I think the last three, I was coming from a place of hurt. And I just finally {{got to the point where}} I'm done hurting and I'm just pissed off about it now. It's turned back to just sheer hate and anger. And it definitely comes across on the album." [...] MTV News said that Davis convinced his fans that they [...] "will be shocked, particularly with the album's second track, 'Break Some Off,' which he called 'brutal'." [...] Korn released the single [...] "Did My Time" [...] on July 22, 2003, which was used to promote the film but did not appear on the soundtrack to [...] due to unspecified legal issues. The single debuted and peaked at number thirty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Korn's first and only top-forty hit in the United States. [...] "Did My Time" [...] gave Korn another Grammy nomination in the Best Metal Performance category.|$|E

500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We would like to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>music,</b> too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E
