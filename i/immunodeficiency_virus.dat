5|$|Human <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> {{infection}} and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is {{a spectrum of}} conditions caused by infection with the human <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience {{a brief period of}} influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with weight loss.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} also {{occurs in}} conditions involving systemic immuno-dysregulation, e.g. cyclic neutropenia and human <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> infection. In cyclic neutropenia, more severe oral ulceration occurs {{during periods of}} severe immuno-dysregulation, and resolution of the underlying neutropenia prevents the cycle of ulceration. The relative increase in percentage of CD8+ T cells, caused by a reduction in numbers of CD4+ T cells may be implicated in RAS-type ulceration in HIV infection.|$|E

5|$|The human <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> (HIV) is {{the virus}} that – when the {{infection}} is not treated – can cause AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Most virologists believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century, and over 70 million individuals have been infected by the virus. By 2011, an estimated 35 million had died from AIDS, {{making it one of}} the most destructive epidemics in recorded history.|$|E
5|$|This is a categorized, {{alphabetical}} list {{of people}} who are known to have been infected with the human <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> (HIV), the pathogen that causes AIDS, including those who have died. AIDS is a pandemic. In 2007, an estimated 33.2million people lived with the disease worldwide, and it killed an estimated 2.1million people, including 330,000 children. Over three-quarters of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts.

40|$|To {{establish}} a productive infection, HIV- 1 must counteract cellular innate immune mechanisms and redirect cellular processes toward viral replication. Recent studies {{have discovered that}} HIV- 1 and other primate <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>viruses</b> subvert cell cycle regulatory mechanisms to achieve these ends. The viral Vpr and Vpx proteins target cell cycle controls to counter innate immunity. The cell-cycle-related protein Cyclin L 2 is also utilized to counter innate immunity. The viral Tat protein utilizes Cyclin T 1 to activate proviral transcription, and regulation of Cyclin T 1 levels in CD 4 + T cells has important consequences for viral replication and latency. This review will summarize this emerging evidence that primate <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>viruses</b> subvert cell cycle regulatory mechanisms to enhance replication...|$|R
40|$|From what <b>viruses</b> {{the human}} <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>viruses</b> (HIVs) {{originated}} {{is an extremely}} controversial question. To address this question, we have analyzed nucleotide sequences of simian <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>viruses</b> (SIVs) and HIVs by using the techniques for understanding molecular evolution. In particular, we compared the nucleotide sequences of whole genomes, gene region by gene region, between a given pair of viruses, including four types of SIVs [...] isolated from mandrills (Papio sphinx), African green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops), sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys), and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) [...] as well as HIVs.

5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} {{of the virus}} to {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface of}} the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs {{more often}} in lesbians, but it is unclear if BV is {{transmitted}} by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women.

Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions. The highest rate of transmission of HIV to lesbians is among women who participate in intravenous drug use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{appears to}} have {{originated}} in southern Cameroon through the evolution of SIV(cpz), a simian <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> (SIV) that infects wild chimpanzees (HIV-1 descends from the SIV(cpz) endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes). The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIV (smm), a virus of the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys atys), an Old World monkey living in litoral West Africa (from southern Senegal to western Côte d'Ivoire). New World monkeys such as the owl monkey are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes.|$|E

40|$|The high {{seroprevalence}} of simian <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>viruses</b> (SIVs) in African green monkeys (AGMs) without immunological {{defects in}} their natural hosts has prompted consideration of SIV-infected AGMs {{as a model of}} apathogenic SIV infection. Study of the molecular mechanisms of SIVagm asymptomatic infection could thus provide clues for understanding the pathogenesis of human <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>viruses.</b> Regulatory genes could be candidates for genetic control of SIVagm apathogenicity. We have characterized Vpr, Tat, Rev, and Nef genes of two SIVagm strains isolated from naturally infected sabaeus monkeys captured in Senegal. The results provide further evidence that SIVagm from West African green monkeys is the most divergent class of AGM viruses, with structural features in long terminal repeat sequences and Vpr and Tat genes that distinguish them from viruses isolated from other AGM species (vervet, grivet, and tantalus monkeys) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} bioassay {{for human}} <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>viruses</b> {{has been developed}} {{on the basis of}} the ability of the tat gene to transactivate the expression of an integrated beta-galactosidase gene in a HeLa-CD 4 + cell line.

The number of infected lymphoid cells in a culture (stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes and cell lines) can also be quantified by cell-to-cell transmission of HIV into the HeLa-CD 4 (+) -beta-galactosidase monolayer.

Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus.</b> Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe 5 '-untranslated region (5 '-UTR) of the genomic RNA {{of human}} <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>viruses</b> type- 1 (HIV- 1) and type- 2 (HIV- 2) is {{composed}} of highly structured RNA motifs essential for viral replication {{that are expected to}} interfere with Gag and Gag-Pol translation. Here, we have analyzed and compared the properties by which the viral 5 '-UTR drives translation from the genomic RNA of both human <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>viruses.</b> Our results showed that translation from the HIV- 2 gRNA was very poor compared to that of HIV- 1. This was rather due to the intrinsic structural motifs in their respective 5 '-UTR without involvement of any viral protein. Further investigation pointed to a different role of TAR RNA, which was much inhibitory for HIV- 2 translation.

5|$|The human <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> (HIV) is a {{lentivirus}} (a {{subgroup of}} retrovirus) that causes HIV infection {{and over time}} acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure {{of the immune system}} allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E

Other studies suggest that B.edulis also has antiviral activity against Vaccinia virus and tobacco mosaic virus grown in culture. Antiviral compounds from mushrooms are a subject of interest in biomedical research for their potential to advance the knowledge of viral replication, and as new drugs in the treatment of viral disease.|$|E
40|$|Lentiviruses, human <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>viruses</b> (HIVs), and simian <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>viruses</b> (SIVs) are {{distinguished}} from oncoretroviruses by {{their ability to}} infect nondividing cells such as macrophages. Retro-viruses must {{gain access to the}} host cell nucleus for replication and propagation. HIV and SIV preintegration complexes (PIC) enter nuclei after traversing the central aqueous channel of the limiting nuclear pore complex without membrane breakdown. Among the nucleophilic proteins, namely, matrix, integrase, Vpx, and Vpr, present in HIV type 2 /SIV PIC, Vpx is implicated in nuclear targeting and is also available for incorporation into budding virions at the plasma membrane. The mechanisms of these two opposite functions are not known. We demonstrate that Vpx is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and contains two novel noncanonical nuclear import signals and a leptomycin B-sensitive nuclear export signal. In addition, Vpx interacts with the cellular tyrosine kinase Fyn through its C-terminal proline-rich motif. Furthermore, our data indicate that Fyn kinase phosphorylates Vpx and regulates its export from nucleus. Replacement of conserved tryptophan residues within domain 41 to 63 and tyrosine residues at positions 66, 69, and 71 in Vpx impairs its nuclear export, virion incorporation, and SIV replication in macrophages. Nuclear export is essential to ensure the availability of Vpx in the cytoplasm for incorporation into virions, leading to efficient viral replication within nondividing cells.

Because early events during in vivo infections may determine both the pathogenic consequences of the challenge virus and its sensitivity to interventions that prevent disease, we have evaluated the effects of inoculum size and a potent antiretroviral drug on the development of disease in monkeys infected with SHIVDH 12 R. The results obtained show that in a majority of inoculated animals, suppression of SHIV replication during the first 2 weeks of infection, which prevents complete loss of CD 4 + T cells, leads to very low to undetectable postpeak viremia and an asymptomatic clinical course for periods up to 4 years...|$|R
5|$|Viruses {{spread in}} many ways. Just as many viruses are very {{specific}} {{as to which}} host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as norovirus are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children.
