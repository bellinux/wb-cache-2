5000|$|The {{superfamily}} Feloidea (or suborder Feliformia)- Felidae (cats), Prionodontidae (Asiatic linsangs), <b>Herpestidae</b> (<b>mongooses),</b> Hyaenidae (hyenas), Viverridae (civets), and Eupleridae (Malagasy carnivorans), {{as well as}} the extinct family Nimravidae (paleofelids) - {{often have}} spotted, rosetted or striped coats, and tend to be more brilliantly colored than their Canoidean counterparts. This is because these species tend to range in tropical habitats, although a few species do inhabit temperate and subarctic habitats. Many are arboreal or semiarboreal, and the majority are digitigrade. Diet tends to be more strictly carnivorous, especially in the family Felidae. They have fewer teeth and shorter skulls, with much more specialized carnassials meant for shearing meat. Feliformia claws are often retractile, or rarely, semiretractile. The terminal phalanx, with the claw attached, folds back in the forefoot into a sheath by the outer side of the middle phalanx of the digit, and is retained in this position when at rest by a strong elastic ligament. In the hindfoot, the terminal joint or phalanx is retracted on to the top, and not the side of the middle phalanx. Deep flexor muscles straighten the terminal phalanges, so the claws protrude from their sheaths, and the soft [...] "velvety" [...] paw becomes suddenly converted into a formidable weapon. The habitual retraction of the claws preserves their points from wear.|$|E

5000|$|A mesocarnivore is {{an animal}} whose diet {{consists}} of 50-70% meat with the balance consisting of non-vertebrate foods which may include fungi, fruits, and other plant material. Mesocarnivores are seen today among the Canidae (coyotes, many foxes), Viverridae (civets), Mustelidae (martens, tayra), Procyonidae (ring-tailed cat, raccoon), Mephitidae (skunks), and <b>Herpestidae</b> (some <b>mongooses).</b>|$|R

50|$|Family <b>Herpestidae</b> (the <b>mongooses,</b> kusimanses, meerkat, etc.) has 32 species. Previously, {{these were}} placed in the family Viverridae. However, Wilson and Reeder (1993) {{established}} the herpestids as morphologically and genetically distinct from viverrids. They are extant in Africa, Middle East and Asia. All have non-retractile claws. They are smaller as a family, ranging from 1 kg (2.2 lb) to 5 kg (11 lb), and typically have long, slender bodies and short legs. Diet varies based on species size and available food sources, ranging from small mammals, birds to reptiles, insects and crabs. Some species are omnivorous, including fruits and tubers in their diet.|$|R
5000|$|The area's apex predators are the felids leopard (Panthera pardus) and caracal (Caracal caracal). Other mammals {{include the}} rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) or [...] "dassie", meerkats (Suricata suricatta) and other <b>mongooses</b> (<b>Herpestidae),</b> larger antelopes (e.g. {{bontebok}} Damaliscus pygargus dorcas and gemsbok Oryx gazella), the vulnerable Cape mountain zebra (Equus zebra zebra), and chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). There are also many birds, small mammals, reptiles and insects.|$|R
40|$|<b>Mongooses</b> (<b>Herpestidae)</b> are small, {{widespread}} carnivores occupying various habitats from Africa to Southeast Asia (Thulin et al., 2006). The genus Herpestes contains 10 species (Nowak, 1999) and {{is considered}} the oldest genus within the order Carnivora, dating back approximately 30 million years (Hinton and Dunn, 1967). The Indian gray mongoose or common grey mongoose (Herpestes edwardsii) is a species of mongoose mainly found in southern Asia mainly India...|$|R
50|$|Lukas and Clutton-Brock (2012) {{extensively}} {{discuss this}} association between monogamy and cooperative breeding. Most females provision {{and care for}} their young; however, there are certain species such as <b>mongooses</b> (<b>Herpestidae),</b> New World monkeys (Callitrichidae), and porcupines (Hystrial) that care for their young in assistance of non-breeding helpers. This concept triggers {{the question as to}} why any individuals would take care of offspring other than their own. As described by the study, this social system could be triggered by the non-breeding helpers’ benefit to maximize their fitness by assisting in the rearing of the young.|$|R
50|$|The {{relationship}} of galidiines to other carnivorans {{has historically been}} controversial. Up {{to the middle of}} the 20th century, all smaller feliformians, including members of the current families Viverridae, Herpestidae, and Eupleridae as well as some smaller groups, were classified in the single family Viverridae. Galidiines, which share some characters with both the civets and genets (current Viverridae) and the <b>mongooses</b> (<b>Herpestidae),</b> were allied early on both with the former and the latter, with some going as far as to doubt that they should be placed in a different subfamily than the other mongooses.|$|R
40|$|Rabies {{isolates}} {{that had}} been stored between 1983 and 1997 were examined with a panel of anti-lyssavirus nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies. Out of 56 isolates from cats and various wild carnivore species, 1 isolate of Mokola virus and 5 other non-typical rabies viruses were identified. The Mokola virus isolate was diagnosed as rabies in 1993 from a cat. Genetic analysis of this isolate suggests that it falls in a distinct subgroup of the Mokola virus genotype. The 5 non-typical rabies viruses were isolated from honey badgers (Mellivora capensis), African civets (Civettictis civetta) and an unidentified <b>mongoose</b> (<b>Herpestidae).</b> These isolates are representatives of rarely-reported wildlife-associated strains of rabies, probably maintained by the slender mongoose (Galerella sanguinea). These findings indicate that both Mokola virus and the mongoose-associated variant may be more common in Zimbabwe than is apparent from routine surveillance...|$|R
2500|$|The {{hedgehog}} (Erinaceidae), the <b>mongoose</b> (<b>Herpestidae),</b> {{the honey}} badger (Mellivora capensis), the secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius), {{and a few}} other birds that feed on snakes are known to be immune to a dose of snake venom. Recently the honey badger and domestic pig was found to have convergently evolved amino acid replacements in their nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which are known to confer resistance to alpha-neurotoxins in hedgehogs. Whether the pig may be considered immune is still uncertain, though early studies show endogenous resistance in pigs tested against neurotoxins. Though it has been thought that the pig's subcutaneous layer of fat protects it against snake venom, most venoms pass easily through vascular fat layers, making this unlikely to contribute to its ability to resist venoms. The garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus) has recently been added to the list of animals refractory to viper venom. [...] Some populations of California ground squirrel (Otospermophilus beecheyi) are at least partially immune to rattlesnake venom as adults.|$|R
40|$|The coatis (Procyonidae) {{and some}} species of <b>mongooses</b> (<b>Herpestidae)</b> are diurnal, small to {{medium-sized}} carnivores {{that live in}} groups and feed opportunistically on small animals and fruits. A comparison of selected features is here presented for two coati species (Nasua narica and N. nasua) and the banded mongoose (Mungos mungo). The former two dwell in the Neotropical region, whereas the latter occurs in the Ethiopian realm. Both the coatis and the mongoose are apt to live near human settlements and capitalise on food refuse. Additionally, coatis and mongooses habituate to humans, and sometimes are a nuisance. These habits, plus their almost constant quest for food, lead these carnivores to meet other mammal types at feeders and garbage dumps and associate with these animals. White-nosed coatis associate with the Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii) and pick ticks on its body, whereas the banded mongoose does so with the common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus). These {{seem to be the}} two sole recorded instances of mammals cleaning non-conspecific mammals, and illustrate a remarkable case of convergence...|$|R
40|$|Duvenhage {{virus was}} {{isolated}} {{from a patient}} who died of a rabieslike disease after being scratched by a bat early in 2006. This occurred ≈ 80 km from {{the site where the}} only other known human infection with the virus had occurred 36 years earlier. The genus Lyssavirus within the family Rhabdoviridae currently includes rabies virus (RABV) (genotype 1) and 6 rabies-related viruses: 3 from Africa, Lagos bat virus (LBV) (genotype 2), Mokola virus (MOKV) (genotype 3), and Duvenhage virus (DUVV) (genotype 4); European bat lyssaviruses 1 and 2 (EBLV 1 and 2) (genotypes 5 and 6); and Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) (genotype 7) (1). Strains of RABV (genotype 1) undergo genetic adaptation to particular animal hosts so that within specific areas the disease is manifested and transmitted predominantly by 1 host species. The canid, or dog, biotype of RABV is the most widely distributed in the world. In South Africa, RABV is transmitted by dogs and jackals in the northern region of the country, by dogs in the eastern region where most cases of human rabies occur, and by bat-eared foxes in the western region. In addition, an indigenous herpestid biotype of RABV (genotype 1) is transmitted by <b>mongooses</b> (<b>Herpestidae)</b> on the interior plateau of South Africa. This biotype does not spread readily to dogs but causes occasional cases of rabies in dogs, cats, humans, and more frequently, cattle and sheep (2). RABV (genotype 1) has never been isolated from bats outside North and South America, but rabies-related viruses have been isolated from bats elsewhere. In Africa, LBV and DUVV are associated with bats, but MOKV is uniquely associated with shrews and rodents, not bats. Fiftee...|$|R
40|$|The family <b>Herpestidae</b> (cusimanses and <b>mongooses)</b> is a {{monophyletic}} radiation of carnivores {{with remarkable}} variation in microhabitat occupation and diel activity, but virtually nothing {{is known about}} how they use vision {{in the context of}} their behavioral ecology. In this paper, we measured the number and topographic distribution of neurons (rods, cones and retinal ganglion cells) and estimated the spatial resolving power of the eye of the diurnal, forest-dwelling Ansorge's cusimanse (Crossarchus ansorgei). Using retinal wholemounts and stereology, we found that rods are more numerous (42, 500, 000; 92 %) than cones (3, 900, 000; 8 %). Rod densities form a concentric and dorsotemporally asymmetric plateau that matches the location and shape of a bright yellow tapetum lucidum located within the dorsal aspect of the eye. Maximum rod density (340, 300 cells/mm 2) occurs within an elongated plateau below the optic disc that cor-responds to a transitional region between the tapetum lucidum and the pigmented choroid. Cone densities form a temporal area with a peak density of 44, 500 cells/mm 2 embedded in a weak horizontal streak that matches the topographic distribution of retinal ganglion cells. Convergence ratios of cones to retinal ganglion cells vary from 50 : 1 in the far periphery to 3 : 1 in the temporal area. With a ganglion cell peak density of 13, 400 cells/mm 2 and an eye size of 11 mm in axial length, we estimated upper limits of spatial resolution of 7. 5 - 8 cycles/degree, which is comparable to other carnivores such as hyenas. In conclusion, we suggest that the topographic retinal traits described for Ansorge's cusimanse conform to a presumed carnivore retinal blueprint but also show variations that reflect its specific ecological needs.

40|$|Rabies, one of {{the oldest}} {{recognized}} viral zoonotic diseases, is a fatal encephalomyelitis transmitted to man via contact with infected animals. Evan today, rabies still is a disease of public health concern with many potentially preventable deaths occurring mainly in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Rabies and rabies-related viruses are members of the Lyssavirus genus, which comprises the rabies virus (genotype 1), Lagos bat virus (genotype 2), Mokola virus (genotype 3), Duvenhage virus (genotype 4), European bat lyssaviruses 1 and 2 (genotypes 5 and 6) and the Australian bat lyssavirus (genotype 7). Antigenic and genetic studies have shown that rabies virus strains circulating in particular host species tend to undergo genetic adaptation and evolve into distinct biotypes that differ in antigenicity and pathogenicity. Two biotypes of rabies virus are recognized in southern Africa. The first called the canid viruses, infect carnivores of the family Canidae (dogs, jackals and bat-eared foxes) and the second, the viverrid viruses, infect carnivores of the family <b>Herpestidae</b> (the yellow <b>mongoose</b> Cynictis penicil!ata and the slender mongoose Galerella sanguinea). In an endeavour to better understand the molecular epidemiology of lyssaviruses in Zimbabwe and South Africa, we analysed nucleotide sequences of the glycoprotein and the G-L intergenic region (rabies viruses) and the nucleoprotein gene (Mokola viruses). The main aim of the studies described in this thesis was to characterise lyssaviruses (genotypes I and 3) from Zimbabwe and compare them to those present in South Africa. In addition, we wanted to establish the role of the various rabies variants in rabies epizootics in the southern African subcontinent. It could be shown from this study that all the southern African canid viruses were closely related, with no general distinction between viruses from any of the canid species. Despite the general overall similarity between the canid viruses, certain phylogenetic groupings were apparent and by association with host species, geography and year of isolation, certain groups could be identified as particular epidemiological cycles. A high genetic diversity was evident amongst viverrid rabies viruses, the opposite of our observation for canid viruses. The viverrid virus groups corresponded to geographical pockets that were independent of host species. Mokola viruses from Zimbabwe were shown to be different from those from South Africa and phylogenetic relationships of these viruses were related to their geographical location of origin. This study has demonstrated the value of multinational surveillance and investigation in understanding the epidemiology of lyssaviruses in southern Africa and elsewhere in Africa. The results presented here will serve as basis for future studies on lyssaviruses in Africa and will contribute to the improved surveillance and control programs of rabies and Mokola viruses in the region.
