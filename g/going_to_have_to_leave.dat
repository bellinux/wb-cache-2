40|$|In late 2006, {{shortly before}} the end of his tenure as {{secretary}} of defense, Donald Rumsfeld made the following remark regarding the ongoing U. S. role in Iraq: “The biggest mistake would be not to pass things over to the Iraqis. It’s their country. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> govern it. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> provide security for it. And they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it sooner rather than later. ” This remark is striking for its ahistorical crassness and demonstrated a striking amount of chutzpah even by Secretary Rumsfeld’s standards.

The festival was plagued by bad weather that forced two different weather evacuations. Nonetheless the festival {{was still able to}} continue mostly as planned and the delays did not cause any serious problems for the festival. The first weather evacuation occurred Friday afternoon in the middle of Capital Cities' set. They were visibly upset everyone was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> and tried to play [...] "Safe and Sound" [...] after being told to end their performance.

5000|$|They {{decided to}} head toward what {{appeared}} to be a pass to the north near present-day Stovepipe Wells, but after discovering this was also impassable, decided they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their wagons and belongings behind and walk to civilization. They slaughtered several oxen and used the wood of their wagons to cook the meat and make jerky. The place where they did this is today referred to as [...] "Burned Wagons Camp", present day Burnt Wagons, and is located near the sand dunes of Death Valley. From here, they began climbing toward Towne Pass and then turned south over Emigrant Pass to Wildrose Canyon in the Panamint Range. After crossing the mountains and dropping down into Panamint Valley, they turned south and climbed a small pass into Searles Valley, with Searles Lake, before making their way into Indian Wells Valley near present-day Ridgecrest. It was here that they finally got their first look at the Sierra Nevada Mountains. They turned south, probably following a trail and traveled across Fremont Valley, close to the same route followed by current California State Route 14. Ironically, they walked right by Walker Pass, present-day California State Route 178 to Lake Isabella, the mountain pass they had set out to look for almost three months earlier.|$|E

Instead she decides to fill out an application for a job but when he sees that she is overqualified he thinks his wife put her up to this. Susan quickly tells him that she is his daughter and explains to him the situation. Addison leaves for his store room and collapses. Susan quickly calls 911. At the hospital, Addison explains to Susan that he had given Sophie money years prior and told her to keep their affair private. Addison tells Susan she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> since his wife and children are coming and that Susan is not considered part of his family. Susan understands this and does not expect a lot, she just wants a father figure. The two are interrupted by Addison's wife, Carol who introduces herself and asks who Susan is. Susan explains to Carol that she is Addison's guardian angel since she was a customer in the store when he collapsed. She gave him CPR and called an ambulance. Carol thanks her for her noble deed. Susan then kisses her father on the cheek and whispers in his ear that she is not giving up.|$|E

Malú does not want to leave so her and Jorgito take matters into their own hands. As many of the people in Cuba did for their own reasons. Already the film is showing how the children have no say in anything their parents are planning to do, as the people in Cuba have no say in what the future of Cuba holds for them. For the children it is hard when a parent tells them they are going to leave their home, but for some people in Cuba during this time they felt like they had to leave to stay safe. For Malú she had just lost her grandmother and now her mother was telling her that she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> all of her friends too. The children do not exactly understand why they cannot change her mother’s mind so they go in search of her father. For the people of Cuba they cannot understand how someone can dictate them the way that they are being treated. When the children finally reach Malú’s father he has already signed the papers and Malú is devastated. She cries and says how could he sign the papers when no one asked her if she even wanted to leave.|$|E
