25|$|Nainoa Thompson recreated the 1976 {{voyage to}} Tahiti {{to become the}} first Native Hawaiian in modern times to {{navigate}} a canoe thousands of miles without instruments. Mau sailed as an observer. After 29 days at sea, before sighting Mataiva on the way to Tahiti, Mau offered Nainoa only one correction; of Nainoa's interpretation of sighting a land-based seabird in mid-morning flight. Such birds generally fly seaward for food at morning and return to land in the evening. While it can usually be assumed that land lies opposite the birds' morning <b>flight</b> <b>direction,</b> this bird spotted mid-morning (during nesting season), carried a fish in its beak. This detail suggested to Mau that the bird's morning flight was not away from land but toward it. The bird was not flying seaward to find more fish, but rather, was returning to land, to feed its young. Leading up to the voyage, an extensive, formal crew training program helped to ensure a safe voyage. Escort boat Ishka followed for safety.|$|E
40|$|Using {{tracking}} radars, {{we investigated}} {{the variability of}} <b>flight</b> <b>directions</b> of long-distance nocturnal passerine migrants across seasons (spring versus autumn migration) and sites at the southern (56 A degrees N) and northern (68 A degrees N) ends of the Scandinavian Peninsula (Lund versus Abisko). Whilst most migrants at Lund are on passage to and from breeding sites in Fennoscandia, {{the majority of the}} migrants at Abisko are close to their breeding sites, and migration at Abisko thus to a large degree reflects initial departure from breeding sites (autumn) or final approach to breeding destinations (spring). The radar data were used to test predictions about differences in orientation and wind drift effects between adult and juvenile birds (a large proportion of autumn migrants consists of juvenile birds on their first journey), between situations far away from or near the goals and between different phases of migration (initial departure, en route passage, final approach to goal). The concentrations (both total and within-night concentrations) of <b>flight</b> <b>directions</b> differed significantly between seasons as well as sites, with the highest concentration at Lund in spring (mean vector length of track directions, r = 0. 79) and lowest at Abisko during spring (r = 0. 35). Partial wind drift and partial compensation were recorded at Lund, with a similar effect size in spring and autumn, whilst possible wind drift effects at Abisko were obscured by the large directional scatter at this site. The results from Lund support the prediction that the high proportion of juveniles in autumn contributes to increase the directional scatter during this season, whilst there was no support for predictions of differential wind drift effects between seasons and situations with different goal distances. The most striking and surprising result was the exceedingly large scatter of <b>flight</b> <b>directions</b> at Abisko, particularly in spring. We suggest that such an exaggerated scatter may be associated with final approach orientation, where migrants reach their specific goals from all various directions by final navigation within a more wide-ranging goal region. The larger scatter of autumn <b>flight</b> <b>directions</b> at Abisko compared to Lund may be due to exploratory <b>flights</b> in variable <b>directions</b> being more common at initial departure from breeding sites than later during migratory passage. These surprising results highlight the importance of studying and analysing orientation during final approach to (and initial departure from) migratory goals for understanding the orientation systems of migratory birds...|$|R
40|$|Birds {{can save}} {{distance}} and {{time on their}} migratory journeys by following great circles rather than rhumblines, but great-circle routes require more complex orientation with changing courses. <b>Flight</b> <b>directions</b> at different places along the route and {{in relation to the}} destination can be used to test whether birds migrate along great circles or rhumblines. Such data have indicated great-circle migration among shorebirds at high latitudes, but no critical tests have been made for passerines. Using tracking radar on board the icebreaker Oden in August 2005, we recorded westerly <b>flight</b> <b>directions</b> of passerine migrants over the Chukchi Sea. The main sector of migratory directions was 237 - 311 degrees centered oil a mean heading direction of 274 degrees. The most likely species to participate in this westward trans-Beringia migration, mainly departing from Alaska, were Eastern Yellow Wagtail (Motacilla Ischutschensis), Arctic Warbler (Phylloscopus borealis kennicotti), Northern Wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), and Bluethroat (Luscinia svecica); all except the Bluethroat were recorded from the ship. Observed <b>flight</b> <b>directions</b> agreed with predicted great-circle courses but not with rhumbline courses for three of these four species with winter quarters in Southeast Asia; no definite conclusion could be drawn for the Northern Wheatear (wintering in East Africa). These results support great-circle migration among passerines traveling between Alaska and Old World winter quarters, though the long-distance precision and orientation mechanisms are Still unknown. The relative importance of different evolutionary causes-such as circumvention of geographic barriers, retracing of ancient colonization ways, or distance reduction by great-circle migration-to complex bird migration routes with changing courses remains to be understood.

The occurrence of Zugunruhe even in cage-raised birds with no environmental cues (e.g. shortening of day and falling temperature) has pointed to the role of circannual endogenous programs in controlling bird migrations.

40|$|Abstract — The {{improved}} {{ground resolution}} of state-of-the-art {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) sensors suggests utilizing this technique {{for the analysis of}} urban areas. However, building reconstruction from SAR or InSAR data suffers from the consequences of the inherent oblique scene illumination, such as layover, occlusion by radar shadow and multipath signal propagation. Especially in built-up areas, building reconstruction is therefore often impossible from a single SAR or InSAR measurement. But, the reconstruction quality can be significantly improved by a combined analysis of multi-aspect data. In this paper, an approach for the detection and reconstruction of buildings from multi-aspect high-resolution InSAR data sets is proposed. The InSAR data have a spatial resolution of about 30 cm and were taken from two <b>flight</b> <b>directions</b> spanning a difference of about 90 °. The building recognition is supported by knowledge based analysis concerning the SAR-specific effects in urban areas. Frequently observable are lines of bright scattering resulting from dihedral corners between ground and building wall. These lines are part of the building footprint and can be distinguished from other lines of bright scattering using the InSAR heights. They are extracted from the magnitude images in slant geometry and projected into the world coordinate system. Here, due to the orthogonal <b>flight</b> <b>directions,</b> they can be fused to L-structures as base for building recognition. Simulation results are compared with real imagery. The approach is demonstrated for an InSAR data set of a building group in an urban environment...|$|R

However, these emerging applications cannot be confidently employed without quantification of the consistency of repeat LiDAR acquisitions. To address this problem, I explore the impact of different sensors, <b>flight</b> <b>directions,</b> and <b>flight</b> altitudes on LiDAR-derived metric and canopy surface model consistency in the Dinkey Creek Watershed. In addition, I analyze whether structural changes in the forest are detected by LiDAR metrics. I conduct metric comparisons at 15 -, 30 -, and 46 -meter resolutions and canopy surface model comparisons at 1 -, 2 -, and 3 -meter resolutions to determine if processing pixel size affects metric consistency. The results show that collecting LiDAR using different sensors, <b>flight</b> <b>directions,</b> and <b>flight</b> altitudes does not reduce {{the stability of the}} metrics. Elevation percentile metrics, canopy proportion metrics, structure classes, and canopy rumple metrics maintain > 0. 90 r 2 values; and elevation mean, elevation standard deviation, and total cover > 2 meters maintain r 2 values above 0. 95 between acquisitions collected two years apart. Additionally, the r 2 values of the canopy proportion metrics are lower in areas harvested between acquisitions, indicating these metrics reflect structural changes in the forest. Metric consistencies increase with pixel size, from 15 - 46 meters. Canopy surface model consistency varies, but maintains r 2 values above 0. 90 for pixel sizes ranging 1 - 3 meters...|$|R

Sun compass routes are similar to orthodromes (great circle routes) at high latitudes, showing changing geographic courses as the birds traverse longitudes and their internal clock gets out of phase with local time. These routes bring the shorebirds from high arctic Canada to the east coast of North America, from which they make transoceanic flights to South America.
