5|$|Virgil Earp was {{not expecting}} a fight. Once Behan said that he'd {{disarmed}} the Cowboys, Virgil traded the short, double-barreled shotgun {{he was carrying}} for Holliday's cane. Virgil carried the cane {{in his right hand}} and shifted the pistol in his waistband from the right side to his left. Holliday concealed the short shotgun under his long jacket. Wyatt too was not expecting a fight and put his pistol in <b>his</b> <b>overcoat</b> pocket.|$|E

Virgil went around the corner on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the shotgun under <b>his</b> <b>overcoat</b> when he returned to Hafford's Saloon.|$|E

He was living on his own means, as was his mother, although his brother Herbert was a stocks and shares dealer. On 21 February 1895 at Christ Church, Surbiton Hill, Kingston he married Anna Christina Ravenhill (1871–1965) second daughter of W.W. Ravenhill of the Inner Temple.

In the story, as presented in [...] "The Debt", the King travels to one of the war cemeteries where a British general is waiting to greet him.

Morin described the situation as [...] "violent". He recalled putting <b>his</b> <b>overcoat</b> over his head so he would not see the tracer bullets and other occurrences during the raid. Morin said that he tried to help a female passenger next to him escape, but she was too large and Morin was unable to move her, so the two held hands.

2500|$|A {{week after}} the Bronx shootings, at 12:30A.M. on February 8, Coll was using a phone booth at a drug store at Eighth Avenue and 23rd Street in Manhattan. He was {{reportedly}} talking to Madden, demanding $50,000 from the gangster under the threat of kidnapping his brother-in-law. Madden kept Coll on the line while it was traced. Three men in a dark limousine soon arrived at the drug store. While one waited in the car, two others stepped out. One man waited outside while the other walked inside the store. The gunman told the cashier, [...] "Keep cool, now", drew a Thompson submachine gun from under <b>his</b> <b>overcoat</b> and opened fire on Coll in the glass phone booth. Coll died instantly. The killers took off in their car. They were chased unsuccessfully up Eighth Avenue by a foot patrolman who had heard the gunshots and commandeered a passing taxi; however, the car got away.|$|E
2500|$|During {{these years}} in Yosemite, Muir was unmarried, often unemployed, with no {{prospects}} for a career, and had [...] "periods of anguish," [...] writes naturalist author John Tallmadge. He was sustained by the natural environment and by reading the essays of naturalist author Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote about the very life that Muir was then living. On excursions into the back country of Yosemite, he traveled alone, carrying [...] "only a tin cup, a handful of tea, a loaf of bread, {{and a copy of}} Emerson." [...] He usually spent his evenings sitting by a campfire in <b>his</b> <b>overcoat,</b> reading Emerson under the stars. As the years passed, he became a [...] "fixture in the valley," [...] respected for his knowledge of natural history, his skill as a guide, and his vivid storytelling.

2500|$|This {{leads to}} the central theme of the short story, as (returning to 1928) the convict and the {{household}} servant, a devout Muslim, attempt to forecast {{the outcome of the}} King's chest condition. They note that the King had forenamed in 1922 the disease that would strike him in 1928; from this, the convict concludes that the King's kindly actions towards the general had saved the general's life and led to a [...] "blood-debt" [...] that would be repaid by the King recovering from his illness. In the short story, this episode with the general and <b>his</b> <b>overcoat</b> is stated to have taken place {{towards the end of the}} pilgrimage at an Indian cemetery, though accounts of Kipling's movements during the pilgrimage ascribe the incident that inspired the short story to a few days earlier on 11 May, a [...] "bitterly cold" [...] day when Kipling had been waiting for the King and Haig near Ypres.|$|E
2500|$|Powell's exact {{movements}} {{from the}} time he was seen cantering up 15th Street until the time he appeared at the Surratt boarding house three days later are not clear. [...] It is well-established that he ended up (by riding or walking) in the far northeast part of the District of Columbia near Fort Bunker Hill, where he discarded <b>his</b> <b>overcoat.</b> In the overcoat pockets were Powell's riding gloves, a false mustache, and a piece of paper with Mary Gardner's name and hotel room number on it. Sources differ widely on what happened. Historian Ernest B. Furgurson says Powell's horse gave out near Lincoln Hospital (now Lincoln Park), a mile east of the United States Capitol on East Capitol Street. He then hid in [...] "a cemetery" [...] (without specifying which). Ownsbey says Powell hid in a tree for three days. Historians William C. Edwards and Edward Steers Jr. claim Powell made it to both Fort Bunker Hill and Congressional Cemetery (at 18th and E Streets SE), while Ralph Gary claims that Powell hid out in a marble burial vault at Congressional Cemetery. Andrew Jampoler, however, says Powell just wandered the streets of the city. Whether Powell abandoned his horse, was thrown by it, or both is unclear, and Powell never gave a public or formal statement about what happened.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 February, Thiers {{announced}} {{the formation of}} a new government with nine ministers, a majority of republicans, including Jules Favre and Jules Simon. The first task assigned by the Assembly was to negotiate an end to the War. Thiers traveled with a delegation of five members of the Assembly to Versailles, where Bismarck was waiting. When he arrived at the hotel, he met the Prussian Field Marshal [...] Moltke, who told him, [...] "You are lucky to be negotiating with Bismarck. If it were me, I would occupy your country for thirty years and in that time {{there would be no more}} France." [...] At the first meeting, Bismarck demanded the province of Alsace and eight billion francs. Thiers insisted that France could pay no more than five billion francs, and Bismarck reduced the payment, but insisted that Germany must have part of Lorraine and Metz as well. The talks were long and stressful; at one point Thiers, exhausted, broke down and wept. Bismarck helped him to a sofa, covered him with <b>his</b> <b>overcoat,</b> and told him, [...] "Ah, my poor Monsieur Thiers, there is no one but you and I who really love France." [...] The negotiations resumed, and Thiers conceded Alsace and part of Lorraine, in exchange for a reduction in the payment. He told the other French delegates, [...] "If we lose one or two provinces it is not of great importance. There will be another war when France will be victorious, and we will get them back. But the billions we give to Germany now we will never recover." [...] Thiers insisted, however, that France keep the fortress town of Belfort. Bismarck conceded the town, on the condition that, when the armistice was signed, the Prussian army could hold a brief victory parade on the Champs-Élysées, and could remain until the treaty was ratified. Thiers felt he had little choice but to accept.|$|E
