5|$|In compilers, {{straight}} line code (that is, sequences of statements without loops or conditional branches) may {{be represented by}} a DAG describing the <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> <b>outputs</b> {{of each of the}} arithmetic operations performed within the code. This representation allows the compiler to perform common subexpression elimination efficiently. At a higher level of code organization, the acyclic dependencies principle states that the dependencies between modules or components of a large software system should form a directed acyclic graph.|$|E
5|$|Plasticity: The synapses between {{parallel}} {{fibers and}} Purkinje cells, and the synapses between mossy fibers and deep nuclear cells, are both susceptible to modification of their strength. In a single cerebellar module, input from {{as many as}} a billion parallel fibers converges onto a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells, and the influence of each parallel fiber on those nuclear cells is adjustable. This arrangement gives tremendous flexibility for fine-tuning the relationship between the cerebellar <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> <b>outputs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Modularity: The {{cerebellar}} {{system is}} functionally divided into {{more or less}} independent modules, which probably number in the hundreds to thousands. All modules have a similar internal structure, but different <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> <b>outputs.</b> A module (a multizonal microcompartment in the terminology of Apps and Garwicz) consists of a small cluster of neurons in the inferior olivary nucleus, a set of long narrow strips of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex (microzones), and a small cluster of neurons {{in one of the}} deep cerebellar nuclei. Different modules share input from mossy fibers and parallel fibers, but in other respects they appear to function independently—the output of one module does not appear to significantly influence the activity of other modules.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{conventional}} Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is {{to evaluate the}} performance of a set of firms or Decision-Making Units using deterministic <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> data. However, the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> data in the real-life performance evaluation problems are often stochastic. The stochastic <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> data in DEA can be represented with random variables. Several methods have been proposed to deal with the random <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> data in DEA. In this paper, we propose a new chance-constrained DEA model with birandom <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> data. A super-efficiency model with birandom constraints is formulated and a non-linear deterministic equivalent model is obtained to solve the super-efficiency model. The non-linear model is converted into a model with quadratic constraints to solve the non-linear deterministic model. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the robustness of the proposed super-efficiency model. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed chance-constrained DEA model and sensitivity analysis...|$|R

Moreover, we give explicit formulas for the Bezout factors. Using a reciprocal approach, we extend our results to a larger class where the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> operators are allowed to be unbounded.

5|$|In September 2006, Dugan {{produced}} the Model E, the E standing for economy. This half-rack-sized automixer was much smaller {{and less expensive}} than previous ones. It could be linked with another Model E to control up to 16 channels; two units could be mounted side-by-side in only 1U of rack space. The Model E's popularity came with many critical requests for features, and in May 2008 the Model E-1 was introduced; an incremental improvement to replace the Model E. It allowed ADAT Lightpipe interconnections between linked units and a digital mixing console, helpful with Yamaha, Mackie and other digital audio gear containing ADAT <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> <b>outputs.</b> Its user interface was a simple web browser page, accessible by computer connected with Category 5 cable.|$|E
