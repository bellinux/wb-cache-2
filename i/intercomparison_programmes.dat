40|$|Quality audits and intercomparisons are {{important}} in ensuring control of processes in any system of endeavour. Present interest is in control of dosimetry in teletherapy, there being a need to assess {{the extent to which}} there is consistent radiation dose delivery to the patient. In this study we review significant factors that impact upon radiotherapy dosimetry, focusing upon the example situation of radiotherapy delivery in Malaysia, examining existing literature in support of such efforts. A number of recommendations are made to provide for increased quality assurance and control. In addition to this study, the first level of intercomparison audit i. e. measuring beam output under reference conditions at eight selected Malaysian radiotherapy centres is checked; use being made of 9 µm core diameter Ge-doped silica fibres (Ge- 9 µm). The results of Malaysian Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratory (SSDL) participation in the IAEA/WHO TLD postal dose audit services during the period between 2011 and 2015 will also been discussed. In conclusion, following review of the development of dosimetry audits and the conduct of one such exercise in Malaysia, it is apparent that regular periodic radiotherapy audits and <b>intercomparison</b> <b>programmes</b> should be strongly supported and implemented worldwide. The programmes to-date demonstrate these to be a good indicator of errors and of consistency between centres. A total of ei+ght beams have been checked in eight Malaysian radiotherapy centres. One out of the eight beams checked produced an unacceptable deviation; this was found to be due to unfamiliarity with the irradiation procedures. Prior to a repeat measurement, the mean ratio of measured to quoted dose was found to be 0. 99 with standard deviation of 3 %. Subsequent to the repeat measurement, the mean distribution was 1. 00, and the standard deviation was 1. 3 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe {{definitions}} {{and application of}} the new ICRU radiation protection quantities have been reviewed and studied in literature. Special emphasis was laid on {{the consequences of the}} use of the new quantities by personnel dosimetry services, and on the consequences of the use of the new quantities during an <b>intercomparison</b> <b>programme</b> for dosimetry services. The study shows that the recommendations of the ICRU are not yet complete and not fully realizable. This means that the dosimetry services always have to make certain approximations, when they use the new quantities. In literature, several approaches have been proposed. The feasibility of an approach depends on the characteristics of the dosimeters used. The use of different approaches by the dosimetry services is thought to be of possible influence on the results of an <b>intercomparison</b> <b>programme...</b>|$|R
40|$|Eighteen {{international}} EPR laboratories {{participated in}} the second <b>intercomparison</b> <b>programme.</b> Each participant had to prepare enamel samples and evaluate the absorbed dose from molars that were irradiated in vitro in the range 0 - 1000 mGy. The objective of the programme was to bring together all methods which are currently applied by different laboratories for EPR dose reconstruction and to demonstrate {{the present state of}} dosimetry. An overview of the essential features of the different methods is presented. The current accuracy of EPR tooth enamel dosimetry under defined conditions of irradiation is evaluated.

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIn 1990, an <b>intercomparison</b> <b>programme</b> for {{personnel}} {{dosimetry services}} {{was developed and}} {{carried out by the}} National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection. Six services participated in this first national intercomparison in the Netherlands, all using TLD systems. In addition, one service also participated with a film badge system. The dosemeters were irradiated with photons on the surface of a 30 cm diameter sphere of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The range of the mean photon energy was 48 keV to 1250 keV. The range of the doses was 0. 055 mSv to 12. 3 mSv. All services were able to reproduce doses larger than 0. 2 mSv within - 33 % and + 50 %. For doses smaller than 0. 2 mSv all services using TLD systems were able to reproduce the conventional true value within +- 100 %...|$|R
40|$|The, {{objective}} of the 3 rd International Intercomparison on Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Tooth Dosimetry was the evaluation of laboratories performing tooth enamel dosimetry below 300 mGy. Participants had to reconstruct the absorbed dose in tooth enamel from 1 1 molars, which were cut into two halves. One half of each tooth was irradiated in a Co- 60 beam to doses in the ranges of 30 - 100 mGy (5 samples), 100 - 300 mGy (5 samples), and 300 - 900 mGy (1 sample). Fourteen international laboratories participated in this <b>intercomparison</b> <b>programme.</b> A first analysis of the results and {{an overview of the}} essential features of methods applied in different laboratories are presented. The relative standard deviation of results of all methods was better than 27 % for applied doses in the range of 79 - 704 mGy. In the analysis of the unirradiated tooth halves 8 % of the samples were identified as outliers with additional absorbed dose above background dose. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to establish radiation standards for absorbed doses, for clinical high energy linear accelerator beams. In the nonavailability of a cobalt- 60 beam for arriving at Nd, water values for thimble chambers, we investigated the efficacy of perspex mounted extrapolation chamber (EC) used earlier for low energy x-rays and beta dosimetry. Extrapolation chamber with facility for achieving variable electrode separations 10. 5 mm to 0. 5 mm using micrometer screw was used for calibrations. Photon beams 6 MV and 15 MV and electron beams 6 MeV and 15 MeV from Varian Clinac linacs were calibrated. Absorbed Dose estimates to Perspex were converted into dose to solid water for comparison with FC 65 ionisation chamber measurements in water. Measurements made during the period December 2006 to June 2008 are considered for evaluation. Uncorrected ionization readings of EC for all the radiation beams over the entire period were within 2 % showing the consistency of measurements. Absorbed doses estimated by EC were in good agreement with in-water calibrations within 2 % for photons and electron beams. The present results suggest that extrapolation chambers can be considered as an independent measuring system for absorbed dose in addition to Farmer type ion chambers. In the absence of standard beam quality (Co- 60 radiations as reference Quality for Nd,water) the possibility of keeping EC as Primary Standards for absorbed dose calibrations in high energy radiation beams from linacs should be explored. As there are neither Standard Laboratories nor SSDL available in our country, we look forward to keep EC as Local Standard for hospital chamber calibrations. We are also participating in the IAEA mailed TLD <b>intercomparison</b> <b>programme</b> for quality audit of existing status of radiation dosimetry in high energy linac beams. The performance of EC has to be confirmed with cobalt- 60 beams by a separate study, as linacs are susceptible for minor variations in dose output on different days...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} the {{precision}} and accuracy of radiocarbon dating in Gliwice Radio-carbon Laboratory on the background of intercomparision programs is discussed. Here are briefly presented results of individual comparisons between laboratories from eight coun-tries and three international <b>intercomparison</b> programmes: ISC <b>Programme</b> (1986), TIRI Programme (1994) and FIRI Programme (1999). Moreover the short description of Gliwice Radiocarbon Laboratory is presented. The main stress is laid on the description of FIRI Programme – types of samples included in Programme and methods of calculation of con-sensus values, {{but first of all}} the participation of our Laboratory in the programme is pre-sented: pretreatment procedures of samples, results obtained in Gliwice and statistical analy-sis of these results. The most important conclusion, which may be drawn from this paper, is that Gliwice Radiocarbon Laboratory dating results are not biased by systematic error. Key words...|$|R
