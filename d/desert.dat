5|$|Carl Eytel (September 12, 1862 – September 17, 1925) was a German American {{artist who}} built his {{reputation}} for paintings and drawings of <b>desert</b> subjects in the American Southwest. Immigrating to the United States in 1885, he settled in Palm Springs, California in 1903. With an extensive knowledge of the Sonoran <b>Desert,</b> Eytel traveled with author George Wharton James as he wrote the successful Wonders of the Colorado <b>Desert,</b> and contributed over 300 drawings to the 1908 work. While he enjoyed success as an artist, he lived as an ascetic and would die in poverty. Eytel's most important work, <b>Desert</b> Near Palm Springs, hangs in the History Room of the California State Library.|$|E

5|$|Southern Africa has no native horse populations, so {{the origins}} of the Namib <b>Desert</b> Horse trace to {{imported}} herds of horses. There are several theories on the ancestors of the Namib <b>Desert</b> Horse, and the true story may never be known. One theory says that a cargo ship carrying Thoroughbreds to Australia wrecked near the Orange River, and the strongest horses swam ashore and traveled to the Garub Plains, the home of the Namib <b>Desert</b> Horse, near Aus, Namibia. Another theory states that they descend from Cape horse/Basuto pony crosses ridden by Khoikhoi raiders traveling from southern Africa to north of the Orange River. The most likely theory has the Namib <b>Desert</b> Horse descending from a combination of escaped South African military horses and Namibian-bred German horses. During World War I, horses were used in campaigns in Namibia between the German Schutztruppe and South African troops, and some escaped or were released into the <b>desert.</b> Prior to this time, a German Baron von Wolf built Dunwisib Castle {{on the edge of the}} Namib <b>Desert,</b> where he held a herd of approximately 300 horses. Von Wolf was killed in action in Europe during World War I, and his farm was abandoned, leaving his horses on unfenced land relatively close to the area where the Namib <b>Desert</b> Horses now roam. The Namib <b>Desert</b> Horse phenotypically more closely resembles the horses bred by von Wolf and ridden by the World War I-era troops than the horses ridden by Khoikhoi tribesmen, making the former story the more likely. The genetic evidence of the 2001 study gave less credence to the descent from von Wolf's horses. He used Thoroughbreds, Hackneys and Trakehners in his breeding program, rather than the Arabian horse to which the Namib <b>Desert</b> Horses are the most genetically similar.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} half of Africa {{is occupied}} by the world's most extensive hot, dry region, the Sahara <b>Desert.</b> Some deserts are also occupying much of southern Africa : the Namib and the Kalahari. Across Asia, a large annual rainfall minimum, composed primarily of deserts, stretches from the Gobi <b>Desert</b> in Mongolia west-southwest through western Pakistan (Balochistan) and Iran into the Arabian <b>Desert</b> in Saudi Arabia. Most of Australia is semi-arid or <b>desert,</b> making it the world's driest inhabited continent. In South America, the Andes mountain range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent, resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina. The drier areas of the United States are regions where the Sonoran <b>Desert</b> overspreads the <b>Desert</b> Southwest, the Great Basin and central Wyoming.|$|E

5|$|A {{semi-arid}} <b>desert</b> or a steppe is {{a version}} of the arid <b>desert</b> with much more rainfall, vegetation and higher humidity. These regions feature a semi-arid climate and are less extreme than regular deserts. Like arid deserts, temperatures can vary greatly in semi deserts. They share some characteristics of a true <b>desert</b> and are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas. They usually receive precipitation from 250mm (10in) to 500mm (20in) but this can vary due to evapotranspiration and soil nutrition. Semi deserts {{can be found in the}} Tabernas <b>Desert</b> (and some of the Spanish Plateau), The Sahel, The Eurasian Steppe, most of Central Asia, the Western US, most of Northern Mexico, portions of South America (especially in Argentina) and the Australian Outback.

The study group were pregnant adolescents who <b>deserted</b> from school system, divided in two subgroups: 86 adolescents who <b>deserted</b> before pregnancy and 130 who <b>deserted</b> during pregnancy. Results: Twenty percent of teenagers that <b>deserted</b> from school before pregnancy belonged to a sublevel of poverty, compared with 5 % of those who <b>deserted</b> during pregnancy.
