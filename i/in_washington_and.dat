5|$|A {{central theme}} of President Obama's inaugural address was a call to restore responsibility—both in terms of {{accountability}} <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases. Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.|$|E
5|$|Bundy's only {{significant}} athletic avocation was snow skiing, which he pursued enthusiastically using stolen equipment and forged lift tickets. During high school {{he was arrested}} at least twice on suspicion of burglary and auto theft.

5|$|Ferris {{returns to}} Hoffman <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> <b>and</b> they devise {{a new plan}} to find Al-Saleem. Suspecting he is {{motivated}} more by pride than ideology, they stage a fake terrorist attack and set up Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman), an innocent Jordanian architect, as its instigator, hoping Al-Saleem {{will come out of}} hiding and attempt to contact him. Al-Saleem sees TV news coverage of the attack and takes the bait.|$|E

5|$|Leccinum manzanitae is a {{mycorrhizal}} species. Its fruit bodies grow singly to {{scattered in}} soil under madrone and manzanita.

Thiers considered it the most abundant Leccinum in California.|$|E
5|$|Sawtooth Mountain is {{the third}} highest peak the Indian Heaven Wilderness <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> the Cascade Range. On clear days hikers can see views of four nearby volcanoes: Mount Adams, Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Rainier from the Sawtooth Mountain Trail, which skirts the subalpine upper west side of Sawtooth Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Blaine {{received}} {{the news at}} his home <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> telegraphed Hayes his congratulations. In the subsequent contest of 1876, Hayes was elected after a contentious compromise over disputed electoral votes. The results of the convention had further effects on Blaine’s political career, as Bristow, having lost the nomination, also resigned as Treasury Secretary {{three days after the}} convention ended. President Grant selected Senator Lot M. Morrill of Maine to fill the cabinet post, and Maine’s governor, Seldon Connor, appointed Blaine to the now-vacant Senate seat. When the Maine Legislature reconvened that autumn, they confirmed Blaine’s appointment and elected him to the full six-year term that would begin on March 4, 1877.|$|E

5|$|By 1963, when President John F. Kennedy began pushing Congress {{to finally}} build the Fort Circle Drive, many <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> the National Park Service were openly {{questioning}} whether the plan had outgrown its usefulness. After all, by this time, Washington had grown past {{the ring of}} forts that had protected it a century earlier, and city surface roads already connected the parks, albeit not in as linear a route as envisioned. The plan to link Fort Stanton Park with other fort parks via a grand drive was quietly dropped {{in the years that}} followed.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN Radio {{broadcasts}} public-affairs programming, {{including some}} audio simulcasts of C-SPAN's flagship television programs like Washington Journal and some radio-only programming {{such as the}} famous tape-recorded Oval Office conversations from the Johnson and Nixon administrations, oral histories, and some committee meetings and press conferences not shown on television due to programming commitments. The radio station does not try to duplicate C-SPAN television coverage, and takes a more selective approach to its broadcast content. Regular programs broadcast on the radio station include Today <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> Prime Minister's Question Time. The station also broadcasts full gavel-to-gavel coverage of political conventions in election years.|$|E
5|$|For the {{commanding}} officers stationed on the Aleutian Islands during the Aleutian Islands campaign, attacking the Kuril Islands from the Aleutians was a logical continuation to recapturing Attu and Kiska. However, these officers faced resistance from their superiors <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> their {{troops on the}} ground. Troop morale had sharply declined {{as a result of}} the island's dismal conditions, creating a condition that the troops called the 'Aleutian stare' amongst those who had been on the island for more than six months. An American assault of the Kuriles never materialised.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} that {{followed}} the completion of the fort, numerous telegraph lines were laid between Fort Corcoran, War Department offices <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> <b>and</b> other forts in Northern Virginia. According to a July 1863 report on the operations of the military telegraphs in the Army of the Potomac, six telegraph lines ran between Fort Corcoran and Washington, five between Corcoran and Fort Ethan Allen, two between Corcoran and Alexandria, and one each to two observation points southwest of the fort. Throughout the remainder of the war, Fort Corcoran remained an important communications center for the entire Arlington Line system of defenses, eventually connecting to over 30miles of telegraph wire at the time of Robert E. Lee's surrender.|$|E
5|$|Initial public {{reaction}} to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. Helens–Gifford Pinchot National Forest area, but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> neighboring Oregon not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The United States Forest Service and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation.|$|E
5|$|Matthews {{died at the}} claimed age of 111 of {{pneumonia}} in Washington, D.C.

He was survived by three of his four daughters, his son, nine grandchildren and seventeen great-grandchildren. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in September 2005 and Washington, D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams spoke at his funeral, which was also attended by councilman and future mayor Adrian Fenty.|$|E

One obtains better finesse using the digital intermediate during post-production and does not risk losing light while selecting filters during expensive on-set time. The filmmakers strove for authenticity and realism in the images, and as such little colouration was added after, and the natural contrast of colours between the locations <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> Morocco were allowed to show through.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} second inauguration on March 4, 1901, William and Ida McKinley {{undertook}} a six-week {{tour of the}} nation. Traveling mostly by rail, the McKinleys were to travel through the South to the Southwest, and then up the Pacific coast and east again, to conclude with a visit on June 13, 1901, to the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. However, the First Lady fell ill in California, causing her husband to limit his public events and cancel a series of speeches {{he had planned to}} give urging trade reciprocity. He also postponed the visit to the fair until September, planning a month <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> two in Canton before the Buffalo visit.|$|E
5|$|The aerial {{rules of}} {{engagement}} applied in Laos (which prescribed the offensive action of pilots and the locations and circumstances under which offensive actions could be taken) were created to protect the civilian population of the country. To the American pilots that conducted the missions, however, they became complex {{to the point of}} incomprehensibility. The rules were constantly altered and elaborated upon by the political decision makers <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> Vientiane and bore little relation to the reality on the ground. There were different rules for every type of activity, for each different branch of service, and in each military region.|$|E

5|$|Unlike many archaeological finds, {{the human}} {{remains at the}} site were able to be dated with environmental, geological, and archaeological methods. Human remains at the site are the oldest {{that have been found}} <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> <b>and</b> at the time were the oldest set of remains found in North America. Later {{radiocarbon}} work has confirmed the original dating of this site, indicating that these human remains, albeit very fragmentary, are still some of the oldest ever excavated in the New World. This finding was useful in confirming the early chronology of the region and confirming the antiquity of the styles of associated bone tools.|$|E
