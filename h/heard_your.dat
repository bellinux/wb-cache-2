500|$|Prior to the 1977 tour Bruford {{declined}} {{an offer}} to return as second drummer, leaving Collins searching for a replacement. He heard American drummer Chester Thompson, of Frank Zappa's band and Weather Report, play a drum passage on [...] "More Trouble Every Day" [...] from Zappa's live album Roxy & Elsewhere. Collins said, [...] "It floored me completely ... I had never met him. I rang him up and said, 'Hi Chester, I've <b>heard</b> <b>your</b> stuff, {{would you like to}} play with Genesis?' ... He didn't even audition!" [...] Genesis toured Wind & Wuthering from January to July 1977 across Europe, North America, and for the first time, Brazil. The stage show cost £400,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). which featured a new PA system, lasers and smoke, and lighting supplied from two rows of Boeing 747 aircraft landing lights. Touring began on 1 January with three sold-out shows at the Rainbow Theatre in London, where 80,000 applications were made for the 8,000 available tickets. They returned to London for three nights at Earls Court, then the largest arena in Britain, supported by Richie Havens. The band's growing popularity in North America led to television appearances and concerts organised in larger venues than previous tours, including Madison Square Garden in New York City. Their Brazilian dates were attended by over 150,000 people and a proposed 100,000-person gig was cancelled over rioting fears. An armed bodyguard accompanied each member throughout their stay.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1912, Alexei {{developed}} a hemorrhage in his thigh and groin after a jolting carriage ride near the royal hunting grounds at Spala, which caused a large hematoma. In severe pain and delirious with fever, the Tsarevich appeared {{to be close to}} death. In desperation, the Tsarina asked Vyrubova to send Rasputin (who was in Siberia) a telegram, asking him to pray for Alexei. Rasputin wrote back quickly, telling the Tsarina that [...] "God has seen your tears and <b>heard</b> <b>your</b> prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much." [...] The next morning, Alexei's condition was unchanged, but Alexandra was encouraged by the message and regained some hope that Alexei would survive. Alexei's bleeding stopped the following day.|$|E
