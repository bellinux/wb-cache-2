5|$|In 1996, severe floods {{caused by}} heavy rainstorms in the San Juan {{watershed}} caused both San Juan and Trabuco creeks to overflow, destroying long {{sections of the}} concrete river banks near their confluence. The damage was attributed to severe erosion at the base which caused the concrete to lose support and crumble. A nearby residential community was threatened, but the floods receded before the levee collapsed and no serious harm was done. The failed sections were repaired with <b>grouted</b> riprap.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} phase of work, {{four types of}} lake margin were constructed. On the southern side of the Central Basin, low reinforced concrete retaining walls were used, while on the eastern side, <b>grouted</b> rock wall can be seen near Commonwealth Park, as well {{as much of the}} East Basin. Sand and gravel beaches were built to cater for lakeside recreational pursuits. These are mostly prevalent on the western half of the lake complex. Rocky outcrops, steeply sloping stable shores with water vegetation such as bullrushes were also used. This treatment is evident in the West Lake in Yarralumla. William Holford and Partners were responsible for the foreshore landscaping, and over 55,000 trees were planted in accordance with a detailed scheme. Eucalypts were preferred so as to maintain the natural colour of the city landscape.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. The first task was to build a stable access road, but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low load-bearing capacity. The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{so there was a}} potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining voids were <b>grouted</b> and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids, to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material.|$|E
30|$|There are {{a variety}} of <b>grouting</b> methods: pre-grouting and post-grouting {{dependent}} on the <b>grouting</b> time relative to roadway driving; cement <b>grouting,</b> clay <b>grouting,</b> and chemical <b>grouting</b> according to <b>grouting</b> materials; single formula <b>grouting</b> and double formula <b>grouting</b> based on the <b>grouting</b> procedures; backfilling <b>grouting,</b> permeating <b>grouting,</b> squeezing <b>grouting,</b> splitting <b>grouting,</b> and high pressure jet <b>grouting</b> according to the geological conditions, the <b>grouting</b> spreading and permeating properties.|$|R
50|$|<b>Grout</b> {{varieties}} include tiling <b>grout,</b> flooring <b>grout,</b> resin <b>grout,</b> non-shrink <b>grout,</b> structural <b>grout</b> and thixotropic <b>grout.</b>|$|R
30|$|The major {{technical}} parameters for bed-separation <b>grouting</b> include <b>grouting</b> materials, <b>grouting</b> pressure, and <b>grouting</b> amount.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} {{adopted by the}} earlier tube lines, each of the UERL's lines was {{constructed}} {{as a pair of}} circular tunnels using tunnelling shields with segmental cast iron tunnel linings bolted together and <b>grouted</b> into place as the shield advanced. Generally the tunnels followed surface roads and were constructed side by side, but where the width of the road above was insufficient, tunnels were placed one above the other. Stations on all three lines were provided with surface buildings designed by the UERL's architect Leslie Green in a standardised style modified for each site. These consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The stations had flat roofs and were designed to accommodate upward extension for commercial development. Most stations were provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E
25|$|Soil nailing is a {{technique}} in which soil slopes, excavations or retaining walls are reinforced by the insertion of relatively slender elements – normally steel reinforcing bars. The bars are usually installed into a pre-drilled hole and then <b>grouted</b> into place or drilled and <b>grouted</b> simultaneously. They are usually installed untensioned at a slight downward inclination. A rigid or flexible facing (often sprayed concrete) or isolated soil nail heads may be used at the surface.|$|E
25|$|The steel support {{structures}} {{are attached to}} concrete foundations with partially threaded steel rods in conduits. These conduits {{were supposed to be}} filled with concrete grout after installation. Some of these voids were temporarily closed at the top with a concrete seal. Later workers incorrectly interpreted some of these locations as having been <b>grouted</b> when they were only sealed at the very top. Incomplete grouting can lead to salt-water intrusion that will accelerate corrosion of these critical rods. It is planned to bore small holes into the grouting to determine which locations require additional grouting or an alternative, injection of oil or similar material, to displace any water.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary {{studies were}} {{preformed}} {{to determine whether}} thermal conductivity of cementitious <b>grouts</b> used to backfill heat exchanger loops for geothermal heat pumps could be improved, thus improving efficiency. <b>Grouts</b> containing selected additives were compares with conventional bentonite and cement <b>grouts.</b> Significant enhancement of <b>grout</b> alumina grit, steel fibers, and silicon carbide increased the thermal conductivity when compared to unfilled, high solids bentonite <b>grouts</b> and conventional cement <b>grouts.</b> Furthermore, the developed <b>grouts</b> retained high thermal conductivity in the dry state, where as conventional bentonite and cement <b>grouts</b> tend to act as insulators if moisture is lost. The cementitious <b>grouts</b> studied can be mixed and placed using conventional <b>grouting</b> equipment...|$|R
30|$|<b>Grouting</b> {{pressure}} {{is the driving}} force that causes slurry to diffuse into the rocks, and it obviously affects the <b>grouting</b> quality and performance. The selection of the <b>grouting</b> {{pressure is}} influenced by ground conditions, <b>grouting</b> materials, <b>grouting</b> procedure, and so on. If a very high <b>grouting</b> pressure is adopted, splitting <b>grouting</b> will take place resulting in the rib spalling or roof collapse. If the <b>grouting</b> pressure is too low, it is difficult to make the slurry diffuse into the rocks.|$|R
25|$|Once again, the St. Francis {{reservoir}} level rose, although not without incident. Late {{in the year}} a fracture was noticed which began at the western abutment and ran diagonally upwards and toward the center section for a distance. As with others, Mulholland inspected it, judged it to be another contraction crack and ordered it filled with oakum and <b>grouted</b> to seal off any seepage. At the same time another fracture appeared in a corresponding position on the eastern portion of the dam, starting at the crest near the last spillway section and running downward at an angle for sixty-five feet before ending at the hillside. It too was sealed in the same manner. Both of these fractures were noted to be wider at their junction with the hillside abutments and narrowed as they angled {{toward the top of}} the dam.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, 1981 and 1982, {{there were}} further repairs {{to the ceiling}} of the presbytery and {{staircase}} of the choir; substitution of the zinc flap edges and tile flooring. In 1980, the LNEC realized a study of the stone, for signs of degradation based on physical, chemical and petrographic assessments. These investigations were followed, in 1983, by conservation and cleaning of the facade, using hydraulic hoses to remove the dirt, accompanied by hard-bristle brushes and soft sponges. In 1984, the DGEMN, demolished and reconstructed the firewall with plaster and whitewash; chipping away the plaster facade and replacing it with new plaster of mortar, whitewashing the completed surface; repair and replacement of the pavement of the choir; replacement of the ceiling plaster, paint and window grills; varnishing the doors; substitution of glass; cracks and joints were <b>grouted</b> in the facade, with new stone replacing older rock, which was removed and replaced.|$|E
500|$|In 1969 a {{flow control}} and erosion {{mitigation}} project for Aliso Creek was begun, requiring {{the construction of}} two concrete drop structures on the creek. These two vertical barriers, [...] high and [...] long, were built both upstream and downstream of Aliso Creek Road. Several <b>grouted</b> riprap structures were also constructed between and downstream of these drops.|$|E
40|$|In Swedish tunnel <b>grouting</b> {{practice}} {{normally a}} fan of boreholes is drilled ahead of the tunnel front where cement <b>grout</b> is injected {{in order to create}} a low permeability zone around the tunnel. Demands on tunnel tightness have increased substantially in Sweden and this has led to a drastic increase of <b>grouting</b> costs. Based on the flow equations for a Bingham fluid the penetration of <b>grout</b> as a function of <b>grouting</b> time is calculated. This shows that the time-scale of <b>grouting</b> in a borehole is only determined by <b>grouting</b> over-pressure and the rheological properties of the <b>grout,</b> thus parameters that the grouter can choose. Pressure, <b>grout</b> properties and the fracture aperture determine the maximum penetration of the <b>grout.</b> The smallest fracture aperture that requires to be sealed thus also governs the effective borehole distance. Based on the identified parameters that define the <b>grouting</b> time-scale and <b>grout</b> penetration an effective design of <b>grouting</b> operations can be set up...|$|R

30|$|<b>Grouting</b> {{materials}} {{can be divided}} into three groups: cement <b>grouting</b> materials, chemical <b>grouting</b> materials, and compound <b>grouting</b> materials. The main performance indexes of <b>grouting</b> materials include slurry viscosity, mechanical properties, and permeability. In addition, flame-retardant and antistatic properties must be stressed for underground coal mines.|$|R
500|$|During {{floods in}} the 1990s, an almost sheer [...] {{waterfall}} appeared on Trabuco Creek in northern San Juan Capistrano, threatening {{the foundations of}} a railroad bridge. The drop required quick reinforcement with <b>grouted</b> riprap. With an average gradient of 29 percent {{it has become a}} major barrier to migrating fish and other riverine organisms, and thus isolates aquatic environments in upper Trabuco Creek {{from the rest of the}} San Juan watershed.|$|E
500|$|The {{course of}} Abrahams Creek has been altered by flood control projects. There is a {{sediment}} retention structure on the creek {{at the lower}} end of [...] "The Hollow". Large portions of the creek, especially in its lower reaches, have undergone full stream channelization, with the stream channel being hardened by concrete or rock. In West Wyoming, a nearly mile-long stretch is lined with concrete. In the early 20th century, part of the creek above The Hollow had <b>grouted</b> stone walls, which were completed in the 1930s.|$|E
500|$|Extensive {{remedial}} works were undertaken between 1999 & 2001 {{to strengthen the}} dam wall. This work involved removing the top [...] of the existing dam wall and drilling/blasting through the dam wall plus up to a further [...] into the bedrock below. The top section of the wall was then rebuilt using reinforced concrete. Finally, permanent, re-stressable ground anchors were then installed through the formed and drilled holes from the crest to be stressed and <b>grouted</b> into the foundation rock. At time of completion, these were the largest capacity and longest permanent ground anchors ever installed in the world.|$|E

30|$|<b>Grouting</b> is an {{effective}} method to reinforce the broken rocks surrounding roadways. Many new <b>grouting</b> materials were developed. To overcome the faults of common cement <b>grouting</b> materials, ultrafine cement slurry was developed with good permeability, high cohesion and durability. Chemical <b>grouting</b> materials, such as polyester, urea–formaldehyde and polyurethane <b>grouts,</b> were also developed and widely used in underground coal mines.

40|$|In {{the paper}} {{the concept of}} “Real Time <b>Grouting</b> Control Method” is {{described}} in order to calculate the <b>grout</b> penetration and to control <b>grouting</b> in real time by applying developed theories for <b>grout</b> spread.

500|$|A small dam {{was built}} about [...] {{downstream}} of Aliso Creek Road in the 1990s—inside Aliso Canyon—as {{part of a}} [...] "mitigation bank project". This project, known as ACWHEP (Aliso Creek Wildlife Habitat Enhancement Project) was intended to provide water to [...] of former riparian areas now several feet higher than the eroded channel of the creek. It was conceived and jointly funded by the county and the Mission Viejo Company. The dam was also supposed to control further erosion downstream. Due to faulty design, however, the dam failed to prevent erosion, which has continued to undermine structures throughout the canyon. The <b>grouted</b> riprap structure is about [...] high and [...] long, and aside from impounding water, captures debris and temporarily controls wet season flows. The building of these modifications, as well as dry weather runoff from seven municipal storm sewer systems, began {{to contribute to the}} infamous pollution of Aliso Creek.|$|E

40|$|<b>Grout</b> {{injection}} is {{used for}} sealing or strengthening the ground {{in order to prevent}} water entrance or any failure after excavation. There are many methods of <b>grouting.</b> Permeation <b>grouting</b> {{is one of the most}} common types in which the <b>grout</b> material is injected to the pore spaces of the ground. In <b>grouting</b> operations, the <b>grout</b> quality is important to achieve the best results. There are four main characteristics for a <b>grout</b> mixture including bleeding, setting time, strength, and viscosity. In this paper, we try to build some efficient <b>grouting</b> mixtures with different water to cement ratios considering these characteristics. The ingredients of <b>grout</b> mixtures built in this study are cement, water, bentonite, and some chemical additives such as sodium silicate, sodium carbonate, and triethanolamine (TEA). The <b>grout</b> mixtures are prepared for both of the sealing and strengthening purposes for a structural project. Effect of each above-mentioned ingredient is profoundly investigated. Since each ingredient may have positive or negative aspect, an optimization of appropriate amount of each ingredient is determined. The optimization is based on 200 <b>grout</b> mixture samples with different percentages of ingredients. Finally, some of these <b>grout</b> mixtures are chosen for the introduced project. It should be mentioned that <b>grouting</b> operations depend on various factors such as pressure of injection, ground structure and grain size of soils. However, quality of a <b>grout</b> can be helpful to make an injection easier and reasonable. For example, during the injection, a wrong estimated setting time can destroy the injected <b>grout</b> by washing the <b>grout</b> or setting early which prevents <b>grouting.</b> This paper tries to show some tests in easy way to achieve a desirable sample of <b>grout...</b>|$|R

500|$|To help {{secure the}} canal's future, in 1987 the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal Society {{was formed to}} protect the canal and {{campaign}} for restoration. Despite the aforementioned problems, on 21October 2005 British Waterways announced funding from European Objective Two Funding, the Northwest Regional Development Agency (NWDA) and Salford City Council for a restoration scheme at the newly named Middlewood Locks in Salford, which began in September 2006. [...] Restoration was halted briefly by the discovery of what was initially {{thought to be a}} Second World War bomb but which proved to be a wartime American mortar with no explosive content. [...] Pilings for the tunnel under the Manchester to Preston Line were completed in 2008. [...] The missing Irwell towpath bridge, known as Bloody Bridge, which once crossed the canal's entrance, was replaced with an arched timber structure incorporating elements of the old lock1.

2500|$|Large {{sections}} of roadway may consist entirely of [...] viaduct, sections with {{no connection to}} the earth other than through vertical columns. When concrete columns are used, the detailing is critical. Typical failure {{may be in the}} toppling of a row of columns due either to soil connection failure or to insufficient cylindrical wrapping with rebar. Both failures were seen in the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake in Kobe, Japan, where an entire viaduct, centrally supported by a single row of large columns, was laid down to one side. Such columns are reinforced by excavating to the foundation pad, driving additional pilings, and adding a new, larger pad, well connected with rebar alongside or into the column. A column with insufficient wrapping bar, which is prone to burst and then hinge at the bursting point, may be completely encased in a circular or elliptical jacket of welded steel sheet and <b>grouted</b> as described above.|$|E
50|$|The {{friction}} pile driving process starts by laying the <b>grout</b> shoe {{at the proper}} location and inserting the spigot end of the pile shaft into the conical point. The pile is kept in place {{by a series of}} keeper plates within the conical <b>grout</b> shoe. As the pile is driven the conical <b>grout</b> shoe creates an annulus between the pile shaft and the surrounding soils. This annulus is immediately and consistently filled with a sand <b>grout</b> that is pumped down the pile shaft and exits within spaced between the keeper fins in the conical points. The breaker hammer driving tool is fitted with a special <b>grout</b> box adapter to allow the <b>grout</b> to flow from the <b>grout</b> pump through the driving tool down into the upper most pile shaft. The pumping rate of the <b>grout</b> should slightly exceed the take rate of the <b>grout.</b> In softer soils the <b>grout</b> takes tend to be higher due to outward bulging of the <b>grout</b> column.|$|R
