40|$|One {{striking}} {{phenomenon in}} the U. S. labor market is the reversal of the gender gap <b>in</b> <b>college</b> attainment.

We find {{that the increase in}} relative earnings between college-educated and high-school-educated individuals and the increasing parental education have important effects on the increase <b>in</b> <b>college</b> attainment for both genders but cannot explain the reversal of the gender gap. Rising divorce probabilities increase returns to college for females and decrease those for males, and thus are crucial in explaining the reversal of the gender gap <b>in</b> <b>college</b> attainment...|$|R

This {{increase in}} the number of faculty positions, alongside the upgrading of research and teaching infrastructure and the increase in competitive research funds, should help Israel to staunch brain drain by enabling the best Israeli researchers at home and abroad to conduct their academic work in Israel, if they so wish, at institutions offering the highest academic standards.|$|E
