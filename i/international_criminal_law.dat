Under the ICTR, the sexual assault unit of the (OTP) created a policy to specifically carry out the legal proceedings of rape, genital mutilation, and other gender-targeted crimes. The OTP also has a Rape and Sexual Violence Section.

500|$|Shortly {{after taking}} power, the Rwandan {{government}} began prosecuting crimes committed during the genocide. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, operating under a United Nations mandate, {{was set up}} in Arusha to judge the most senior leaders responsible for the genocide. In addition, the Rwandan government determined to prosecute all suspected perpetrators, including the many ordinary citizens who had taken part in the killings, in order to end the [...] "culture of impunity" [...] that it blamed for the genocide. Between 1994 and 2000, 120,000 suspects were arrested. The prisons were overcrowded and the courts could not process all the cases. By 2006 only 10,000 of those arrested had been tried. The government introduced Gacaca, a village court system based on traditional Rwandan justice.

40|$|In <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> {{tribunal}} discourse, {{appeals to}} history and legitimacy are omnipresent. This article addresses the widespread practice of combining these appeals into one narrative. It analyses how international prosecutors engage with justifying the legitimacy of trials through the invocation of a tribunal's own history. The scrutiny of such 'auto-histories' as a specific form of history-telling illuminates an overlooked dimension of trials as fora for writing history. The opening statement is a perfect opportunity for constructing and communicating auto-histories. A comparative study of opening statements at the International Military Tribunal, the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> Court reveals a recurrent, self-justifying narrative where both rootedness in history and a {{break with the past}} are key to singing the tribunal into existence as a crucial mechanism in the transition from chaos to peace.

40|$|This chapter compares and {{contrasts}} temporary <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> tribunals to {{the permanent}} <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> Court (ICC) referencing <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>law's</b> and UN Security Council's (UNSC) relationship to 'crisis'. All the {{situations where the}} UNSC has acted in <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> justice are critical {{in the sense that}} they involve crucial decisions where members elect among distinct choices in inherently unstable situations. My argument is that crises enable a negative grounding of legal and political jurisdiction that relies on legitimation that is confirmed by judicial bodies. The analysis outlines the institutionalisation of an exceptional legal mechanism in the practice of the <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), its proliferation to the <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and its normalisation in the <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> Court (ICC). The purpose of this analysis is neither to parse what the law is and what it should be-nor what the law does versus what it promises-, but rather to show how and why individual criminal responsibility in the absence of State intervention demonstrates a globalising political power that is conjoined to a universalising legal glory. A crisis is a liminal situation, which by its ambiguity enables that process of power being linked to glory. Arts, Education & Law Group, School of LawFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|Modes of liability, such as ordering, instigation, {{superior}} {{responsibility and}} joint criminal liability, are {{arguably the most}} discussed topics in modern <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> justice. In recent years, {{a wide range of}} scholars have rebuked some of these modes of liability for compromising basic concepts in liberal notions of blame attribution, thereby reducing international defendants to mere instruments for the promotion of wider socio-political objectives. Critics attribute this willingness to depart from orthodox concepts of <b>criminal</b> responsibility to <b>international</b> forces, be they interpretative styles typical of human rights or aspirations associated with transitional justice. Strangely, however, complicity has avoided these criticisms entirely, even though it too fails the tests <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> lawyers use as benchmarks in the deconstruction of other modes. Moreover, the source of complicity’s departures from basic principles is not international as previously suggested - it stems from <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>law’s</b> emulation of objectionable domestic criminal doctrine. If, instead of inheriting the dark sides of domestic <b>criminal</b> <b>law,</b> we apply <b>international</b> scholars’ criticisms across all modes of liability, complicity (and all other modes of liability) disintegrates into a broader notion of perpetration. A unitary theory could also attach to all prosecutions for international crimes, both international and domestic, transcending the long-endured fixation on modes of liability within the discipline...|$|R
