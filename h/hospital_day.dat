40|$|Using a {{published}} protocol, we evaluated a non-selected population of stroke patients to identify unnecessary days of hospitalisation in the Department of Neurology at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland. This study was undertaken {{to determine whether}} physicians can modify the non-medically justified <b>hospital</b> <b>days.</b> We prospectively studied 118 patients with stroke admitted to our Department {{over a period of}} 5 months. Each day spent on the ward was placed in one of two categories: those due to medical reasons (1, 391 <b>hospital</b> <b>days)</b> and those due to non-medical reason (518 days). Using a previously published protocol, 74 parameters were evaluated. Delays in obtaining examinations or a specialist's consultation accounted for a small proportion of waiting days (1. 9 % of total <b>hospital</b> <b>days),</b> which was greater in patients who were not disabled (0. 9 % of <b>hospital</b> <b>days)</b> than in patients with total dependence (0. 2 % of <b>hospital</b> <b>days).</b> The delays resulted mainly from awaiting transfer either to another department or to a nursing home. The length of stay increased with severity of dependence. However, the number of days spent for transfer to a nursing home was also relatively high in the non-dependent patient group (42 % of <b>hospital</b> <b>days).</b> This study demonstrates that neurologists cannot easily influence the length of stay in hospital. It also corroborates the need to develop short- and long-term chronic care facilities to facilitate the transfer of patients once there are no further medical reasons for staying in hospital...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Smoking {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} risk factors for burden of disease. Our objective was to estimate the number of <b>hospital</b> diagnoses and <b>days</b> of treatment attributable to smoking for Canada, 2002. Methods Distribution of exposure was taken from a major national survey of Canada, the Canadian Community Health Survey. For chronic diseases, risk relations were taken from the published literature and combined with exposure to calculate age- and sex-specific smoking-attributable fractions (SAFs). For fire deaths, SAFs were taken directly from available statistics. Information on morbidity, with cause of illness coded according to the International Classification of Diseases version 10, was obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information. Results For Canada in 2002, 339, 179 of all hospital diagnoses were estimated to be attributable to smoking and 2, 210, 155 acute care <b>hospital</b> <b>days.</b> Ischaemic heart disease was the largest single category in terms of <b>hospital</b> <b>days</b> accounting for 21 percent, followed by lung cancer at 9 percent. Smoking-attributable acute care <b>hospital</b> <b>days</b> cost over $ 2. 5 billion in Canada in 2002. Conclusion Since the last major project produced estimates of this type, the rate of <b>hospital</b> <b>days</b> per 100, 000 population has decreased by 33. 8 percent. Several possible factors may have contributed to the decline in the rate of smoking-attributable hospital days: a drop in smoking prevalence, a decline in overall <b>hospital</b> <b>days,</b> and a shift in distribution of disease categories. Smoking remains a significant health, social, and economic burden in Canada. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To {{assess the}} impact of process {{analyses}} and modifications on inappropriate hospital use. Design. Pre-post comparison of inappropriate hospital use after process modifications. Setting. The Department of Internal Medicine of the Geneva University Hospitals, Switzerland. Participants. A random sample of 498 patients. Interventions. Two processes of care (i. e. non-urgent admissions and transfer to a rehabilitation hospital), which influenced inappropriate hospital use, were identified and modified. The impact of these modifications was then assessed. Main outcome measures. The proportion of inappropriate hospital admissions and inappropriate <b>hospital</b> <b>days.</b> Results. As a baseline assessment before quality improvement interventions, the appropriateness of hospital use (admissions and <b>hospital</b> <b>days)</b> was evaluated using the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP) in a sample of 500 patients (5665 days). After modification of the two processes through a quality improvement program, inappropriate hospital use was reassessed in a sample of 498 patients (6095 <b>days).</b> Inappropriate <b>hospital</b> admissions decreased from 15 to 9 % (P = 0. 002) and inappropriate <b>hospital</b> <b>days</b> from 28 to 25 % (P = 0. 12).
