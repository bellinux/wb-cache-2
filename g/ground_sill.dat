5000|$|A {{sill plate}} or sole plate in {{construction}} and architecture {{is the bottom}} horizontal member of a wall or building to which vertical members are attached. The word plate is typically omitted in America and carpenters speak simply of the [...] "sill". Other names are ground plate, <b>ground</b> <b>sill,</b> groundsel, and midnight sill. Sill plates are usually composed of lumber but can be any material. The timber {{at the top of}} a wall is often called a top plate, pole plate, wall plate or simply [...] "the plate".|$|E
5000|$|The {{timber frame}} is close studded, with the {{vertical}} timbers placed particularly close together. The east face has a jettied gable. The intervening panels are plastered. [...] Horizontal rails are {{absent from the}} exterior frame, except as needed to frame windows. This is typical of medieval timber framing. Unusually, {{two different types of}} bracing are present. Curved tension braces, starting from the horizontal <b>ground</b> <b>sill,</b> are found on the ground floor; these are rare in Cheshire, being more commonly found in south-east England. The first floor features arch braces, which start from vertical timbers and go up to meet the wall plate; these are typical of the Midlands variety of timber framing. Both forms of brace are large. In later close-studded or decorative-framed buildings these braces were typically concealed or omitted.|$|E
50|$|As it was remarked by others, {{the most}} {{distinctive}} {{feature of this}} construction is the plan with its lateral apses. The entrance of the church {{was placed on the}} south and its threshold is the long southern <b>ground</b> <b>sill,</b> laid first over the stones of the foundation. The western part of the narthex ends polygonal, with three short walls. At the opposite side, the sanctuary has also a polygonal shape with five outer walls. In the middle it is the nave, enlarged on both lateral sides by two polygonal apses, also with five short outer walls. Behind the iconostasis, {{on both sides of the}} sanctuary, but unobserved from outside, there are two rectangular pockets like rooms used as prothesis and diaconicon. In Moldavia, loana Cristache-Panait mentioned about 30 wooden churches with a similar trefoil plan. The church was built 7 m wide for about 95 men and 75 women, which was a mean parish at that time. Inside the nave there is a choir loft that much probably was built at the same time with the church, and there can about 45 children, young men and women attend the service, apart from their parents. As in the plan, the church continues to respect the Moldavian constructive tradition in the lower part of its elevation. The lower walls were erected 3.7 m high, higher than the half of the width of the church. The uppermost timbers end outside the wall with cantilevers to support the eaves purlins of the lower roof. These cantilevers, high above the ground and shaped with numerous stylised heads of horses, arc very specific for Moldavia. The same can be said about the dimensions and the design of the portals, windows and openings in the wall between men and women. The consoles inside the nave and sanctuary, and the cross beams supporting the flat ceiling over the narthex are all adorned with filigree like decoration. The large eaves formed by the long ends of the lower rafters and the typical continuous roof over the apses and all around the church complete the list of Moldavian features.|$|E

Another, we know the data intense increase and are close to extreme value when interval of <b>ground</b> <b>sills</b> are 2 ~ 7 times channel wide. Besides, the effect of full river length protection to steady channel and reduce scour rate is better than half section protection. By the relationship between average scour rate of riverbed and stream power,we know that have direct proportion between them. According to this, under the protection range of <b>ground</b> <b>sills</b> are based on known terms like components of the interval <b>ground</b> <b>sills,</b> we establish the relationship equation among average scour rate, stream power, critical silt start power, interval of <b>ground</b> <b>sills</b> and slope gradient: the related coefficient r 2 = 0. 89.

50|$|A village weaver's nest is 14-17 cm {{long and}} 11-13 cm high. The {{entrance}} is mostly extended into {{a tube of}} 4-8 cm long. The male weaves {{the structure of the}} nest using long strips of leaf, that he has torn from palms or large grass species such as Arundo donax. The nest is roofed, ovoid or kidney-shaped, internally consisting of a nesting chamber that is separated by a <b>ground</b> <b>sill</b> from an antechamber, that has the entrance of the entire nest at the bottom. On the inside, the ceiling is made of strips of grass or other leaves, which are simply inserted in stead of woven-in. The floor on the inside is lined by short, thatched strips of palm, grass blades or heads, and feathers. The nest requires about three hundred long strips of leaf, which the male tears off and transports one by one. The male gathers building material throughout the building process, during which he works with his feet in exactly the same position, and maintaining the same orientation. He starts by creating the attachment by weaving around mostly two hanging branches just below a fork, a foot on both of them, which he includes in a ring he constructs by weaving in the plain of the branches at the edge of his reach. He than extends {{the high end of the}} ring in front of its head, gradually working towards his feet creating a half-globe, that is the nesting chamber. The male continues by constructing the roof of the antechamber, working over his head. This is followed by lining the ceiling, and constructing the entrance tube, hanging upside-down, but still with his feet at the same spots. The weaving technique consists of seizing a strip of near the end and double the strip back on itself. Next he pokes the end with a vibrating movement in between his previous work until it sticks. He then release it, moves his head to the other side of the nest wall, seizes the strip again and pokes it in somewhere. He keeps repeating this, regularly reversing the direction in which he weaves the strip, poking and pulling the strip through holes until the entire length is used. The female collects material too, but she occupies herself only with the lining of the nesting cup.|$|E

40|$|Background to the Study The lack of {{competitiveness}} of Japan’s wood producers, continued growth in imported lumber and wood products, {{and a growing}} unmanaged timber stock on Japanese national and private forests spurred the Japanese government to review lumber imports {{and its relation to}} its depressed wood products market. Although the initial Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries inquiry into how exports of wood products from the US and other regions of the world have proven injurious to the domestic industry never reached a pan-ministry consensus, {{at the time of this}} writing some lumber products are still on the MAFF’s list of products for potential WTO safeguard protection. A Safeguard Action under WTO guidelines requires that the Japanese government: (i) identify the affected industry, be it the forestry sector or the wood-processing sector; (ii) identify the affected product and its relation to substitute import products; (iii) determine how the sharp increase in imports resulted in injury to the affected industry; and (iv) determine how Safeguard measures would improve the competitiveness of the affected industry over the 4 to 8 year period it is in effect. Study Objectives This study, through in-country interviews, literature review, and data analysis, sought to analyze the state of the competitiveness of the Japanese forestry and wood products industries, and, using the CINTRAFOR Global Trade Model, to determine the impact of a protectionist trade policy on the domestic industry’s competitive strength and upon Japanese home-buying consumers. Summary of Findings During the period of the writing of this report it appeared that the threat of a WTO Safeguard Action subsided. However, as of July 2001 lumber products are still officially listed by MAFF for a potential safeguard action. Though this is not a study regarding the impact of protectionism on US or foreign exports to Japan the consequence of such a protectionist action on US and foreign wood exports to Japan is large. As the study findings suggest the benefit of trade restrictions to the domestic industry is mixed with the main burden of such an action being shouldered by the Japanese consumer. Many of the reasons for the lack of Japanese forestry and wood product sector competitiveness have more to do with internal systemic issues than with external issues traceable to exports. Potential Impact of a Safeguard Action Although the intended objectives of the Government of Japan forestry and forest products policies and subsidies is to realize “an era of domestic timber, a Safeguard Action may have the opposite effect by increasing log imports 44 %. · A simulated 25 % increase in tariffs under a Safeguard Action, causes a 20 % increase in domestic lumber production and a 7 % increase in domestic log production. · Consumers of lumber products lose approximately $ 3 billion dollars annually. This is more than double the Forestry Agency subsidy monies supporting the forest and wood processing industry. · The 16 % increase in the price of lumber resulting from a Safeguard Action has the potential to increase home construction costs by ¥ 264, 000 yen per house. · Sawmills processing imported logs tend to have a higher level of average production, suggesting that a Safeguard Action may lead to consolidation in the industry, negatively impact the smaller mills that rely on domestic logs. Forestry Industry: Internal Systemic Issues · Japan has an unusually high cost of forestry compared to other regions of the world. · Poor profitability in forestry is due in part to geography, such as steep terrain, which makes forest management challenging and increases the cost of harvest and extraction The low profitability is reflected in a Forestry Agency study which estimates that the internal rate of return from a sugi plantation has declined from 6. 3 % in 1965 to 4. 1 % in 1975 to 2. 1 % in 1985 to 0. 9 % in 1993. · The exceedingly small size of private forests, most around 5 hectares, makes it difficult for owners to raise capital and manage efficiently. · The depopulation and aging of the forestry and wood products workforce seriously impacts productivity and efficiency of the forestry industry. According to one survey 57 % of forestry workers are over the age of 55 while less than 10 % are under the age of 35. Wood-processing Industry: Internal Systemic Issues · Japan’s harvesting and delivery costs to the mill are now nearly three times more than those costs in the US Pacific Northwest region and six times larger than those in Scandinavia and the southern hemisphere. · Imported log prices, energy and labor costs combined with a decreasing log processing efficiency results in Japan’s sawmills being high cost producers of lumber relative to their competitors. · Electrical rates for the saw-milling sector in Japan are 3 to 4 times higher than other producers. · The small size and scale of sawmills in Japan contribute to their lack of profitability. Production cost estimates for 1996 indicate that Japanese costs are approximately 156 % higher than a sawmill in British Columbia, Canada. While labor, energy, and capital costs are less than 50 % higher than BC, stumpage prices for sugi are 250 % higher than hemlock. · The performance based regulatory environment surrounding the housing industry (Housing Quality Assurance Act and the 10 -Year Housing Warranty) is altering the product and species mix, displacing some domestic species. For example, demand for yellow cedar and treated lumber in <b>ground</b> <b>sill</b> (dodai) applications has also increased as a result of the 10 -year Housing Warranty. Conclusion: Protection is Not the Path to Competitiveness Since 1955, Japan has seen its self-sufficiency in wood products decline from approximately 95 % to below 20 % by 2000. While there are a variety of factors that have contributed to this decline, the net effect has been that domestic forest products manufacturers have lost tremendous market share to imported wood products. Similarly, the competitiveness of the forestry sector has declined significantly relative to imported softwood logs. The dominance of the timber market by imported timber has contributed to a fundamental structural change within the forestry and forest products sector. Analysts and politicians have charged that these structural changes in the forestry and forest products sector have not only adversely affected the competitiveness of the domestic forest products sector but that they have severely restricted the ability of forest owners to actively manage forests in Japan, both private and public. In an attempt to rectify this inability to manage its forests and to bolster the competitiveness of its forestry and wood-products industries the Government of Japan has considered a Safeguard. However, the conclusion of this study is that given the burden that this trade restriction will likely cause to the Japanese consumer coupled with the probability of a significant increase in log imports, protection is not the road to profitable and well-managed forests and wood products industry. Perhaps more importantly, given the internal systemic issues described earlier, there appears to be little likelihood that a Safeguard would result in the increased competitiveness of the sawmill industry...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the poor}} economy in Japan, there remain {{promising}} niche markets for Alaskan softwood lumber. The unique characteristics of Alaskan softwood species are {{well suited to}} the demands of the Japanese market in general and Japanese post and beam home builders in particular. In addition, Alaskan species, particularly Sitka spruce and Alaska yellow cedar, enjoy a good reputation in Japan. For example, as a result of recent regulatory changes in the residential construction sector, it may be advantageous for Alaskan producers to supply kiln-dried lumber and glulam products milled to the specific dimensions required by the post and beam industry. Given that Alaskan producers cannot compete solely on the basis of price, a more effective strategy is to differentiate their products using non-price attributes that are valued in Japan. The primary aims of this research were to identify niche market opportunities for Alaskan timber species in the Japanese post and beam industry, describe those market opportunities and provide recommendations to help Alaskan sawmills evaluate the niche opportunities in Japan and objectively assess how those market opportunities match their own production and sales capabilities. The market opportunities in specific niche markets are described below. RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION The Housing Quality Assurance Act of 2000 requires that all builders provide a 10 year warranty on their homes, including the structural components used to frame-in the house. This requirement has had a significant impact on the species of lumber specified for structural components that are used in ground contact applications. In the future, Japanese builders are expected to increase their use of naturally durable timber species in an effort to reduce their liability and increase the performance of their homes. A second factor influencing material specification in residential construction has been the homebuyers’ increasing awareness of, and concern about, “sick house syndrome”. Sick house syndrome has received extensive coverage within the Japanese media and, while it is primarily attributed to off-gassing of volatile organic compounds (VOC’s) from carpeting, paint, and vinyl wall coverings and their adhesives, this concern on the part of some homebuyers has caused a growing number of builders to reduce or discontinue their use of engineered wood products and pressure treated wood. The combination of these two factors provides Alaskan sawmills with a unique opportunity to increase their sales of Alaska yellow cedar lumber in both the post and beam as well as the 2 x 4 segments in the home building industry. LAMINA FOR GLUE-LAMINATED BEAMS Currently there are six glu-lam beam manufacturers in Japan that utilize Alaska yellow cedar lumber to produce laminated dodai and posts. Alaska yellow cedar glu-lam <b>ground</b> <b>sills</b> tend to be used in higher end homes, although some builders of mid-price homes use yellow cedar glu-lam <b>ground</b> <b>sills</b> as a way of demonstrating the high quality of their houses and differentiating their homes from their competitors. In addition to <b>ground</b> <b>sills,</b> there are also opportunities to export lamstock produced from Sitka spruce and hemlock for use as posts and structural beams. This is particularly true because Alaskan timber species tend to be slow growth with narrower growth rings and correspondingly higher strength characteristics than the same species growing in other parts of the Pacific Northwest. LUMBER FOR SHOJI COMPONENTS Traditional Japanese homes typically have a tatami room. The tatami room may be where the family gathers or it may serve as a bedroom at night. Tatami rooms use a large volume of appearance grade wood in exposed applications such as beams, shoji screens, and moldings. While there are fewer tatami rooms being built in Japanese homes today, there is still a good demand for high quality yellow and red cedar, as well as Sitka spruce and white spruce, for shoji components. In addition, the price premiums obtained for shoji grade lumber make this a good market for lumber manufacturers. This research has demonstrated that there are a number of potential market opportunities in Japan for softwood lumber from Alaska. These range from rough green lumber to planed and kiln-dried lumber to laminated yellow cedar sill plates (dodai). The most promising opportunities were found to be yellow cedar dodai for the post and beam market, 2 x 4 and 2 x 6 yellow cedar dimension lumber for sill plates in the 2 x 4 market, Alaska yellow cedar, Sitka spruce, and hemlock lamina for the laminated beam industry, and rough, green or planed, kiln-dried yellow cedar, western red cedar, Sitka spruce, and white spruce lumber for the shoji manufacturing industry. Having identified a series of market opportunities for softwood lumber from Alaska is not enough though. A more important factor is to provide sawmill managers in Alaska with a series of marketing recommendations that will allow them to objectively assess and determine if exporting softwood lumber to Japan makes strategic sense for their company and, perhaps more importantly, that will assist them in determining whether their company is prepared to make the commitment of time and resources that are critical to achieving success in the Japanese market. A series of ten strategic marketing recommendations developed during the course of this study are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Meltwater {{accumulated}} on the Greenland Ice Sheet drains to glacier beds, discharging into fjords {{hundreds of}} meters below sea level. The injection of meltwater at depth generates an upwelling plume that entrains warm ocean water as it rises along the terminus, increasing submarine melt and driving a fjord-scale exchange flow. However, due to sparse ocean-glacier observations, we lack a process {{understanding of how}} plumes control fjord circulation and submarine melt. Combining numerical modeling, theory, and observations, this dissertation investigates near-glacier plume dynamics, the influence of glacier depth on plume structure and submarine melt, {{and the role of}} fjord-glacier geometry on circulation in tidewater glacier fjords. 	In Chapter II, I use buoyant plume theory and a nonhydrostatic, three-dimensional ocean–ice model to investigate the sensitivity of plume dynamics to subglacial discharge, turbulent diffusivity, and conduit geometry. Large discharges result in plumes with positive temperature and salinity anomalies in the upper water column. Fjord circulation is sensitive to conduit geometry; distributed subglacial discharge results in a stronger return flow of warm water toward the terminus. In Chapter III, I use buoyant plume theory, initialized with realistic ranges of subglacial discharge, glacier depth, and ocean stratification, to investigate how plume structure and submarine melt vary during summer months in 12 Greenland fjords. Grounding line depth is a primary control on plume-induced submarine melt: deep glaciers produce warm, salty subsurface plumes that undercut termini, and shallow glaciers produce cold, fresh surface-confined plumes that can overcut. Finally, in Chapter IV, I use regional-scale numerical ocean simulations to systematically evaluate how fjord circulation forced by subglacial plumes, tides, and wind stress depends on fjord width, glacier depth, and <b>sill</b> height. Glaciers <b>grounded</b> below <b>sill</b> depth can draw shelf waters over a shallow sill and into fjord basins with seasonal subglacial discharge; this process is independent of external shelf forcing. These results underscore the first-order effect that subglacial discharge and fjord-glacier geometry have in controlling fjord circulation and, thus, ocean heat flux to the ice.

40|$|The Holy Island Dyke on Holy Island, Northumberland strikes E-W {{along the}} south coast of the island. It intrudes Lower Carboniferous rocks and crops out as five {{discrete}} segments of dolerite. Flat tops on the two largest segments, benches on the southern flanks of three segments, and flat surfaces with amygdales at several locations on the outcrop have all been cited {{as evidence that the}} exposures represent the original top surface of the dyke, where it terminated within the country rocks. The results of a magnetic survey of the dyke show that the principal outcrops are connected to the northern edge of a sill whose top surface lies within 10 m of the present <b>ground</b> surface. The <b>sill</b> is exposed on the foreshore adjacent to St Cuthbert’s Isle in the west, where it forms an outcrop near the low water mark that has not previously been reported. The sill is about 100 m wide in the N-S direction and, at its southern edge, is connected to a subsurface dyke that extends downwards. Thus the dolerite outcrops appear {{to be part of a}} step-and-stair transgression of bedding. This interpretation accounts for all the features previously cited as evidence of the upward termination of the Holy Island Dyke within the sedimentary succession. ...|$|R
40|$|Shallow - level sill {{emplacement}} can uplift Earth’s surface via forced folding, providing {{insight into}} the location and size of potential volcanic eruptions. Linking the structure and dynamics of <b>ground</b> deformation to <b>sill</b> intrusion is thus critical in volcanic hazard assessment. This is challenging, however, because: (1) active intrusions cannot be directly observed, meaning that we rely on transient host rock deformation patterns to model their structure; and (2) where ancient sill - fo ld structure can be observed, magmatism and deformation has long - since ceased. To address this problem, we combine structural and dynamic analyses o f the Alu dome, Ethiopia; a 3. 5 - km - long, 346 - m - high, elliptical dome of outward - dipping, tilted lava flows c ross - cut {{by a series of}} normal faults. Vents distributed around Alu feed lava flows of different ages that radiate out from or deflect around its periphery. These observations, coupled with the absence of bounding faults or a central vent, implies that Alu is not a horst or a volcano, as previously thought, but is instead a forced fold. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar data captured a dynamic growth phase of Alu during a nearby eruption in A. D. 2008, with periods of uplift and subsidence previously attributed to intrusion of a tabular sill at 1 km depth. To localize volcanism beyond its periphery, we contend that Alu is the first forced fold to be recognized to be developing above an incrementally emplaced saucer - shaped sill, as opposed to a tabular sill or laccolith...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPetermann Glacier {{is a major}} glacier in {{northern}} Greenland, maintaining {{one of the few}} remaining floating ice tongues in Greenland. Monitoring programs, such as NASA's Operation IceBridge have surveyed Petermann Glacier over several decades and have found it to be stable in terms of mass balance, velocity and grounding-line position. The future vulnerability of this large glacier to changing ocean temperatures and climate depends on the ocean–ice interactions beneath its floating tongue. These cannot currently be predicted due to a lack of knowledge of the bathymetry underneath the ice tongue. Here we use aerogravity data from Operation IceBridge, together with airborne radar and laser data and shipborne bathymetry-soundings to model the bathymetry beneath the Petermann ice tongue. We find a basement-cored inner sill at 540 – 610 m depth that results in a water cavity with minimum thickness of 400 m about 25 km from the <b>grounding</b> line. The <b>sill</b> is coincident with the location of the melt rate minimum. Seaward of the sill the fjord is strongly asymmetric. The deepest point occurs on the eastern side of the fjord at 1150 m, 600 m deeper than on the western side. This asymmetry is due to a sedimentary deposit on the western side of the fjord. A 350 – 410 m-deep outer sill, also mapped by marine surveys, marks the seaward end of the fjord. This outer sill is aligned with the proposed Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) grounding-line position for Petermann Glacier. The inner sill likely provided a stable pinning point for the grounding line in the past, punctuating the retreat of Petermann Glacier since the LGM...|$|R
