5|$|An <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor</b> is a {{molecule}} that binds to an enzyme and decreases its activity. Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are enzyme inhibitors. They {{are also used}} in pesticides. Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; enzyme activators bind to enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, while enzyme substrates bind and are converted to products in the normal catalytic cycle of the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor</b> is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are enzyme inhibitors, {{so their}} discovery and improvement {{is an active}} area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor</b> is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.|$|E
40|$|Heart {{failure is}} {{becoming}} increasingly frequent. Once diagnosed, 5 -year survival is less than 50 % and a substantial percentage of patients (25 % to 50 %) die suddenly. Angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are the only agents shown to reduce mortality in heart failure. All angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> appear to have similar clinical benefits in heart failure. Therapy should be started with a low dose and titrated up to the target dosage in major trials. Although angiotensin-I receptor antagonists provide more complete inhibition of angiotensin-II effects, {{they have not been}} found to be superior to long-acting angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in reducing morbidity and mortality in heart failure. Therefore, in current clinical practice, angiotensin-II antagonists should be used as an alternative to angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> when the latter are not tolerated. The combined use of angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and angiotensin-II antagonists is not currently recommended in the treatment of heart failure.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} {{and describe the}} clinical course of angio-oedema reactions induced by angiotensin converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> DESIGN AND METHODS [...] All reports of angio-oedema reactions associated with angiotensin converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> submitted to Swedish Adverse Reactions Advisory Committee were reviewed and the clinical courses summarised. Numbers of cases judged to be induced by angiotensin converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> were related to their annual usage, estimated from total sales of defined daily doses, {{as well as to}} the estimated number of new patients. All cases of angio-oedema associated with angiotensin converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> reported to the World Health Organisation's international drug information system were also summarised. RESULTS [...] 36 of the 38 reported cases in Sweden between 1981 and 1990 were judged to be related to angiotensin converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> During 1981 through 1990, altogether 1309 cases of angio-oedema associated with angiotensin converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> were registered with the international drug information system. The incidence of reported cases of angio-oedema increased largely in parallel with the increased sales (usage) of angiotensin converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Of the 36 Swedish patients, 77 % experienced the reaction within the first three weeks after starting treatment. 10 patients needed hospitalisation, two of whom had life threatening laryngeal obstruction. With one exception all 36 patients were free of symptoms within one week after discontinuing the drug. CONCLUSIONS [...] Angio-oedema induced by angiotensin converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> is a rare but potentially life threatening reaction, which in most instances occurs shortly after the start of treatment. Any patient in whom the reaction is suspected should have the treatment interrupted and, if necessary, be admitted for observation...|$|R

5|$|Although many natural toxins are {{secondary}} metabolites, these poisons {{also include}} peptides and proteins. An {{example of a}} toxic peptide is alpha-amanitin, which is found in relatives of the death cap mushroom. This is a potent <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> in this case preventing the RNA polymerase II enzyme from transcribing DNA. The algal toxin microcystin is also a peptide and is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. This toxin can contaminate water supplies after algal blooms and is a known carcinogen that can also cause acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.|$|E
5|$|In mixed inhibition, the {{inhibitor}} {{can bind to}} {{the enzyme}} {{at the same time}} as the enzyme's substrate. However, the binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate, and vice versa. This type of inhibition can be reduced, but not overcome by increasing concentrations of substrate. Although it is possible for mixed-type inhibitors to bind in the active site, this type of inhibition generally results from an allosteric effect where the inhibitor binds to a different site on an <b>enzyme.</b> <b>Inhibitor</b> binding to this allosteric site changes the conformation (i.e., tertiary structure or three-dimensional shape) of the enzyme so that the affinity of the substrate for the active site is reduced.|$|E
5|$|New {{drugs are}} the {{products}} of a long drug development process, {{the first step of}} which is often the discovery of a new <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> In the past the only way to discover these new inhibitors was by trial and error: screening huge libraries of compounds against a target enzyme and hoping that some useful leads would emerge. This brute force approach is still successful and has even been extended by combinatorial chemistry approaches that quickly produce large numbers of novel compounds and high-throughput screening technology to rapidly screen these huge chemical libraries for useful inhibitors.|$|E

5|$|<b>Enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> {{are found}} in nature and are also {{designed}} and produced as part of pharmacology and biochemistry. Natural poisons are often <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> that have evolved to defend a plant or animal against predators. These natural toxins include {{some of the most}} poisonous compounds known. Artificial inhibitors are often used as drugs, but can also be insecticides such as malathion, herbicides such as glyphosate, or disinfectants such as triclosan. Other artificial <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> block acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which breaks down acetylcholine, and are used as nerve agents in chemical warfare.|$|R
5|$|Since inhibitors {{modulate}} {{the function}} of enzymes they are often used as drugs. Many such drugs are reversible competitive inhibitors that resemble the enzyme's native substrate, similar to methotrexate above; other well-known examples include statins used to treat high cholesterol, and protease inhibitors used to treat retroviral infections such as HIV. A common example of an irreversible inhibitor that {{is used as a}} drug is aspirin, which inhibits the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes that produce the inflammation messenger prostaglandin. Other enzyme inhibitors are poisons. For example, the poison cyanide is an irreversible <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor</b> that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and blocks cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|Physiological enzyme {{inhibition}} {{can also be}} produced by specific protein inhibitors. This mechanism occurs in the pancreas, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as zymogens. Many of these are activated by the trypsin protease, so {{it is important to}} inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself. One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent trypsin inhibitor protein in the pancreas. This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ. Although the trypsin inhibitor is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state. Other examples of physiological <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor</b> proteins include the barstar inhibitor of the bacterial ribonuclease barnase and the inhibitors of protein phosphatases.|$|E

Sales of angiotensin converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in Sweden were also summarised. SUBJECTS [...] Patients receiving angiotensin converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> who reported adverse respiratory reactions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Clinical characteristics of adverse reactions of asthma, bronchospasm, and dyspnoea. RESULTS [...] In Sweden 424 adverse respiratory reactions were reported, of which most (374) were coughing. However, 36 patients had adverse drug reactions diagnosed as asthma, bronchospasm, or dyspnoea. In 33 of these cases the indication for treatment with angiotensin converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> was hypertension, in only three heart failure. The respiratory symptoms occurred in {{about half of the}} patients within {{the first two weeks of}} treatment, and about one third needed hospitalisation or drug treatment. Dyspnoea symptoms occurred in conjunction with other symptoms from the airways or skin in 23 out of the 36 cases. In the WHO database there were 318 reports of asthma or bronchospasm, 516 reports of dyspnoea, and 7260 reports of cough in relation to 11 different angiotensin converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> CONCLUSION [...] Symptoms of airway obstruction in relation to treatment with angiotensin converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> seem to be a rare but potentially serious reaction generally occurring within the first few weeks of treatment...|$|R

However, the other dissociation constant Ki' is difficult to measure directly, since the enzyme-substrate complex is short-lived and undergoing a chemical reaction to form the product. Hence, Ki' is usually measured indirectly, by observing the enzyme activity under various substrate and inhibitor concentrations, and fitting the data to a modified Michaelis–Menten equation ...|$|E
500|$|The {{most widely}} used {{treatment}} for parkinsonism is administration of L-DOPA, the metabolic precursor for dopamine. L-DOPA is converted to dopamine {{in the brain and}} various parts of the body by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase. [...] L-DOPA is used rather than dopamine itself because, unlike dopamine, it is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. It is often co-administered with an <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor</b> of peripheral decarboxylation such as carbidopa or benserazide, to reduce the amount converted to dopamine in the periphery and thereby increase the amount of L-DOPA that enters the brain. [...] When L-DOPA is administered regularly over a long time period, a variety of unpleasant side effects such as dyskinesia often begin to appear; even so, it is considered the best available long-term treatment option for most cases of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
