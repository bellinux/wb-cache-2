5|$|Development of Jedi Knight {{was led by}} Justin Chin, who {{had also}} worked on the {{previous}} game. The most significant developments for Jedi Knight are the use of The Force and the lightsaber. The Force plays an integral role in how the player plays the game and shapes the way the game is played. The method of allocating credits to Force powers was designed with a role-playing video game style in mind, allowing the player the choice of which powers to improve. Chin said <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> interview that progress in the game {{is based upon the}} abilities the player develops.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> account, Sophocles {{wrote that}} Tereus {{was turned into}} a large-beaked bird whom some {{scholars}} translate as a hawk while a number of retellings and other works (including Aristophanes' ancient comedy, The Birds) hold that Tereus was instead changed into a hoopoe. Various later translations of Ovid state that Tereus was transformed into other birds than the hawk and hoopoe, including references by Dryden and Gower to the lapwing.|$|E

5|$|Scorsese's complex filmmaking {{commitments}} to multiple film projects resulted <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> legal challenge before filming of Silence could be initiated. In August 2012, Cecchi Gori Pictures sued Scorsese over an alleged {{breach of contract}} agreements related to Silence. According to the company, in 1990 Scorsese signed a written agreement to direct Silence. Scorsese was supposed to shoot the film following 1997's Kundun, and Cecchi Gori Pictures had apparently invested more than $750,000 for this purpose. However, Scorsese chose to make Bringing Out the Dead, Gangs of New York, and The Aviator first.|$|E
