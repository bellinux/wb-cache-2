40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel method for defining the thermal performance of walling systems under dynamic {{heating and cooling}} conditions. This is an innovative development as it incorporates the contribution of both thermal resistance and thermal mass in the one parameter. This is of particular importance for masonry construction as it directly reflects contribution of its thermal mass. These are important steady-state parameters, but are inadequate in fully defining the thermal performance under dynamic temperature conditions such as a typical diurnal temperature cycle. The measure is called "the dynamic temperature response" or "t-value", and it inherently considers the properties and configuration of the insulation and thermal mass within a wall when exposed to typical temperature fluctuations. The method has been verified experimentally for both laboratory and in-situ conditions using a modified guarded hot box apparatus and several <b>housing</b> <b>test</b> modules located at the University of Newcastle. The background research is described together with examples of {{the application of the}} concept to a range of walling configurations. Due to its inherent thermal mass, the measure directly relates to masonry construction and confirms that the energy required for moderate weather conditions is more efficient if an appropriate combination of both thermal mass and thermal resistance is utilized, especially if passive solar design principles are used...|$|E
40|$|Housing {{which has}} good thermal {{performance}} provides a steady and comfortable internal environment and has less energy consumption {{regardless of the}} weather conditions. The contribution of thermal mass is well recognized, however the influence of heavy (masonry) internal partition walls and concrete floor slabs is often passed over when considering the enhancement of the overall thermal performance. The impact of the internal thermal mass of masonry components, {{in the form of}} internal partition walls and the interior leaf of multi-layered enclosure walls, on the overall temperature variations and energy consumption of housing is investigated in the paper. The results are based on a detailed study of the performance of several full scale <b>housing</b> <b>test</b> modules incorporating a range of typical Australian walling systems. The study confirmed the premise that the thermal resistance (R-value) alone (a steadystate parameter) cannot represent the actual dynamic thermal performance of a building. The relative performance of the walling systems varied with season, but in general, the thermal mass of the partition walls and the internal skins of the enclosure walling systems were effective in absorbing energy from solar ingress and dampening the effects of the external diurnal temperature swings. This influence improves the thermal performance and has the potential to minimise the need for artificial heating and cooling in both new dwellings and in the retrofitting of existing houses...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} seven years an {{extensive}} research program has been underway in the Priority Research Centre for Energy at the University of Newcastle in conjunction with Think Brick Australia aimed at investigating the thermal performance characteristics of walling systems particularly in relation to housing. This is a full-scale study using four purpose-built <b>housing</b> <b>test</b> modules constructed with a range of walling types. The study has been supplemented by the construction and commissioning of a Guarded Hot Box apparatus to measure wall thermal resistance properties as well as the development of building simulation energy modelling software. This paper gives a brief overview of the project and explores the difference in the observed behaviour of the housing modules constructed with four different wall types with a range of thermal resistances (R Values). The walls were cavity brick, insulated brick veneer, insulated cavity brick and insulated lightweight. The internal conditions could be allowed to “free float”, or be controlled within a comfort range by a heating/cooling system with the energy consumption being measured. The results show that the use of the wall R-value as the sole parameter to define the thermal performance of a building is not sufficient, as the internal comfort levels and energy demands of the modules built with walls with similar R-values were significantly different due to the influence of other effects such as the thermal mass of the walling systems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel concept called the 'Dynamic Thermal Response' (DTR) {{which accounts for}} {{the contribution of the}} masonry components of walling systems in buildings when exposed to typical temperature fluctuations. The concept is of particular importance for masonry construction as it directly reflects the contribution and appropriate arrangement of the insulation and thermal mass within each wall. The concept can also be expanded to capture the overall thermal performance of building enclosures (termed the 'DTRS'). The current worldwide emphasis in the assessment of the thermal performance of buildings is to use static thermal conditions, with the thermal resistance (R-value) of the various building components being the principal parameter considered. None of the existing methods consider the location of the insulation in relation to the high thermal mass components of the walls, despite this being an important parameter. This importance is illustrated by the comparative behaviour of insulated brick veneer and insulated reverse brick veneer walling systems, which can have the same steadystate R-value but significantly different thermal performance. The DTR concept takes into account the dynamic nature of the environmental conditions, the response of the wall to environmental changes and more importantly, facilitates the assessment of the thermal performance of the building as a whole (using the DTRS as a direct extension of the concept). The principles of the concept and the fact that masonry construction significantly reduces heating and cooling loads have been confirmed using data obtained from observations of the thermal performance of existing lightweight and heavy walling <b>housing</b> <b>test</b> modules. The concept has the potential to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of current energy efficiency measures and ultimately lead to more thermally efficient house designs as well as the assessment of the performance of retrofitting techniques for existing housing...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of the internal air temperature of a building is pivotal to its design in the {{determination of}} heating and cooling loads and {{the assessment of the}} thermal comfort for the occupants. Autodesk CFD analysis is one of many application programs which can assist in calculating building internal air temperatures and it is expected that using a smaller time step size can provide more accurate results but long term simulations for complex building analysis is significantly lengthening computing time. To solve these issues a larger time step can be used. This speeds up the computing time and also results in a higher predicted (and more realistic) internal temperature fluctuation range. This is reported in this paper, where the larger time scale technique is used with an average capacity personal computer (PC) machines to perform the simulations. This fast Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation method is used to simulate the thermal performance of a series of existing <b>housing</b> <b>test</b> modules constructed using a range of walling systems. The performance of the proposed computing technique is assessed by comparing the internal air temperature of each building at the floor level. To find the time step which gives the most accurate simulation of the measured internal air temperature, CFD simulations were carried out for various time steps (15, 30, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 180 minutes); it was found that 80 and 100 minute time steps gave the most accurate representation of the real fluctuation. The fastest simulation with the most accurate results was for a 80 / 100 time step where more than 87 % of the results fell within a 3 °C range compared to the real data. This also required only 1 % of the computing time compared to a 1 minute time step...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} low energy {{buildings}} requires accurate thermal simulation software {{to assess the}} heating and cooling loads. Such designs should sustain thermal comfort for occupants and promote less energy usage over the life time of any building. One of the house energy rating used in Australia is AccuRate, star rating tool to assess and compare the thermal performance of various buildings where the heating and cooling loads are calculated based on fixed operational temperatures between 20 °C to 25 °C to sustain thermal comfort for the occupants. However, these fixed settings for the time and temperatures considerably increase the heating and cooling loads. On the other hand the adaptive thermal model applies {{a broader range of}} weather conditions, interacts with the occupants and promotes low energy solutions to maintain thermal comfort. This can be achieved by natural ventilation (opening window/doors), suitable clothes, shading and low energy heating/cooling solutions for the occupied spaces (rooms). These activities will save significant amount of operating energy what can {{to be taken into account}} to predict energy consumption for a building. Most of the buildings thermal assessment tools depend on energy-based approaches to predict the thermal performance of any building e. g. AccuRate in Australia. This approach encourages the use of energy to maintain thermal comfort. This paper describes the advantages of a temperature-based approach to assess the building’s thermal performance (using an adaptive thermal comfort model) over energy based approach (AccuRate Software used in Australia). The temperature-based approach was validated and compared with the energy-based approach using four full scale <b>housing</b> <b>test</b> modules located in Newcastle, Australia (Cavity Brick (CB), Insulated Cavity Brick (InsCB), Insulated Brick Veneer (InsBV) and Insulated Reverse Brick Veneer (InsRBV)) subjected to a range of seasonal conditions in a moderate climate.

Significant savings (of about 50 %) in energy consumption in minimising the time required for heating and cooling were achieved by using the adaptive thermal comfort model...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{growing demand}} for energy, energy supply security, climate change and ways to reduce {{greenhouse}} gases (GHG) have all {{played a significant role}} in the designing of new sustainable buildings. To design efficient sustainable buildings, the accuracy of a building’s thermal simulation will have direct implications on the prediction of the thermal performance of the building and the operational energy costs for the life of the building. Therefore, the output of any simulation should reflect the actual performance in order to save more building operating energy and reduce GHG emissions. The main purpose of this research is to verify the validity of a universal metric, proposed for the first time in this study, to characterise the thermal performance of complete buildings called the Adaptive Thermal Metric (ATM). This metric facilitates the assessment of the thermal performance of whole building envelopes which leads to more thermally efficient housing designs. Using the building’s internal air temperature the new method takes into consideration the various building materials, orientation, shading, occupant behaviour, weather at the site and the environment surrounding the building. The ATM uses temperature to assess the building’s thermal performance, thus differing from other widely accepted methods that are based on energy consumption. This research consists of three stages. In the first stage, the variations of the internal air temperature of four existing <b>housing</b> <b>test</b> modules (Cavity Brick (CB), Insulated Cavity Brick (InsCB), Insulated Brick Veneer (InsBV) and Insulated Reverse Brick Veneer (InsRBV)) are compared with CFD simulation results to determine the accuracy of the CFD simulation. Long period CFD simulations have typically faced some issues, such as long computing times and internal air temperature increases over time. After addressing these issues, the simulations were carried out for one year, using larger time steps (minimizing the computing time by more than 99 % when compared to a 1 minute time step simulation) and with results with an average accuracy of 93 % compared with the real data at any given time during the studied year. This is the first attempt to use CFD alone, without the assistance of any additional software to find the internal air temperatures of buildings over long periods. In the second stage of the research, two universal metrics using an adaptive thermal comfort range with 90 % and 80 % acceptability limits are developed (designated ATM 90 and ATM 80 respectively). There ATM’s account for the percentage of time over which the internal temperature of a building remains within the define comfort limits. The results of the characterisation of the thermal performances for both limits indicated that the best performing module was the InsCB, followed by the InsRBV, InsBV and CB modules, respectively. These results are consistent with the previous findings from University of Newcastle research on walling systems and the AccuRate building assessment tool used in Australia, and thus justify the possibility of using this metric as a new assessment tool to characterise the thermal performance of complete building. In the final stage of the research, appropriate ways to improve building energy design in order to reduce the amount of energy required to sustain thermal comfort are considered. This includes a feasibility study to find the best energy efficient design with the least cost. As a case study CFD simulations were carried out and the ATM determined for a complete house in a different climate zone. CFD simulations resulted in an average accuracy of 92 % which is consistent with the previous CFD simulations for the <b>housing</b> <b>test</b> modules at the University of Newcastle. The ATM was able to reproduce the thermal performance of different housing types in different locations. This illustrates the possibility of using the ATM as a new universal metric which could be applied anywhere around the world. The results found in this research are promising and may facilitate the use of this metric as a new building assessment method to accurately predict the thermal performance of any building envelope. Since the occupants are able to use various strategies to control their perception of the internal conditions, the method also has the potential to reduce the amount of heating and cooling energy necessary to sustain thermal comfort...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University, 1950. The {{adult male}} pinworm {{measures}} from 2 to 5 millimeters in length, and has its terminal and curved ventrad. The female pinworm {{is more than}} twice as large as the male, 8 - 13 millimeters in length, and has its tail portion decidedly attenuate. Pinworm ova is characteristically flattened on one side, and measures 55 by 30 micrometers. 	Examination of the feces show {{only a small percentage of}} the actual number of cases infected with pinworms. D'Antoni and Sawitz (1940) reported diagnosing less than 1 per cent of the true incidence using direct fecal films, and less than 25 per cent using fecal concentration techniques. 	The use of swabs is the present accepted means for diagnosing pinworm infections. Many swabs have been devised, but only two are in general use (1) the NIH swab, and (2) the Graham swab. These two swabs require a total of 7 consecutive swabs before an individual is considered to be negative. 	Serological testing seems to be of little value in diagnosing the presence of Enterobius. The reactions encountered upon injection of various sorts of extracts of pinworm individuals are not specific and therefore of little diagnostic value. 	The incidence of Enterobius in North America can be regarded as high, probably infecting half the people of North America. 	Central America and Mexico seems to be the most heavily infected area of continent. According to Sandground (1933) and Mazzotti and his associated (1940) and (1943), the majority of central americans and mexicans are probably harboring pinworms. 	In the Canadian-Alaska areas, the incidence of pinworms is high, according to Kuitunen-Ekbaum (1940) and (1943) and Ashburn (1941). 	The numerous papers presented on the incidence of pinworms in various parts of the United States supports the view that possibly 40 percent or more of the people in the United States are infected with pinworms. 	The injury that results from infections with Enterobius is slight. Gravid female migrations may set up local irritations in the anal area known as prurtis ani. This latter phenomenon is often used as a basis for diagnosing pinworms. MacArthur (1930) reported that the first and most important case of nocturnal prurtis is the presence of Enterobius. Numerous other complaints are associated with pinworm infections; anorexia, irritability, headaches, gastro-intestinal symptoms and so forth. 	Anal washes and ointments were once highly favored in treating pinworm infections, but they are, for the most part, no longer used. Wright, Brady, and Bozicevich (1939) reported anal ointments to be of doubtful value in treating cases of enterobiasis since they failed either to destroy females or render the ova non-viable. 	Santonin was shown by Wright, Brady, and Bozicevich (1939) to be far from effective in treating pinworms infections. 	Tetrachloroethylene is probably the best single dose drug for the treatment of Enterobius, but in large does it is not well tolerated by the patients especially children. 	Phenothiazine therapy is the standard treatment for enterobiasis in Europe and appears to be quite effective in ridding individuals of pinworms. With the use of phenothiazine nearly 90 percent cures are effected. 	Hexylresorcinol is probably the best all around drug available in pinworm therapy. The drug is better tolerated in large doses than most anthelmintics. It has, however, two major disadvantages, (1) it is expensive, and (2) if treatment is to be effective it must proceed for a considerable length of time. 	Hygienic measures alone will not clear up infections with pinworms. Best results are obtained when medication is coupled with hygienic controls. 	Thirty-six institutionalized boys, between the ages of 13 and 17, were examined with the use of a modified anal swab. The swab consists of a small test tube having a ring of Scotch tape affixed to its terminal end. The applicator tube when not in use was inserted into a larger, <b>housing</b> <b>test</b> tube.

Of the 36 boys examined on the basis of four swabs, 18 or 50. 0 percent were found to be infected with pinworms.

50|$|Following Mercedes {{claims that}} the new {{refrigerant}} could be ignited, Germany's Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (Federal Motor Transport Authority) conducted its own tests. The Authority concluded that while the substance was potentially more hazardous than previously used R-134a, it did not comprise a serious danger. However the German automakers disagree with their findings, and test procedures. Following other independent and in <b>house</b> <b>testing,</b> General Motors still plans to transition all new models to the new refrigerant by 2018. Chrysler announced that they would continue the transition to R1234yf as well. Japanese automakers are also making the transition to R1234yf, Honda and Subaru have begun to introduce the new refrigerant already with the 2017 models.|$|R
