2500|$|But as we stood, {{one of the}} porters behind {{called out}} [...] "Simba"; and we {{caught a glimpse of}} a big lioness {{galloping}} down beside the trees, just beyond the donga … Tarlton took his big double-barrel and advised me to take mine, as the sun had just set and it was likely to be close work; but <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> for the Winchester 405 is, at least for me personally, the [...] "medicine gun" [...] for lions.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> whereat {{he looked}} more {{disappointed}} than before.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> feebly, for I was {{longing to}} accept his offer.|$|E

3000|$|... “I have {{stones in}} my brain, haven’t I?…just like stones in tofu (soybean curd). If <b>I</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> strongly, moving stones would damage the tofu…Then I always {{try not to}} <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> in <b>my</b> life.” (M 4) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good! {{there is}} no good. But can I help it, if I love him? Can I make myself not love him by just wishing it? Oh, I would do it if I could. But now you will {{understand}} why <b>I</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> when you talk of my coming to your house. Your ways and my ways must be different." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> though I guessed {{well enough}} what night he meant.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> blankly, for I {{had never}} heard {{anything}} of the sort.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> in sorrow, a {{thrust of}} jealousy cutting me the while.|$|E
60|$|<b>I,</b> however, <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> when {{he pointed}} out the {{advantages}} of his position. I was still wondering about Ralph.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, never now," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "He has {{forgotten}} all about me, I dare say. Or if he hasn't, he has never forgiven me." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> but <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> The youth said no more, and, after {{placing the}} food upon {{the floor at}} my side, {{returned}} up the corridor, taking the light with him.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> {{with all}} my flush of joy changed to foolish resentment.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} its great black hole yawned close, but <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and {{dismissed}} him. After {{a very brief}} toilet I hastened downstairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen {{have often}} asked me that," [...] said Moodie slowly; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and say little or nothing, and creep {{out of the}} way as well as I can. I am a man of few words; and if gentlemen were to be told one thing, they would be very apt, I suppose, to ask me another. But it happens just now, Mr. Coverdale, that you can tell me more about the maker of those little purses than I can tell you." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> {{will not}} <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> about when going in {{inhabited}} areas.|$|R
60|$|She said nothing. I {{looked back}} at her from the door. Her eyes were fixed upon me, a little distended, full of mute questioning. <b>I</b> only <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> So <b>I</b> left her and passed out into the night.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{and felt}} myself {{swelling}} with the inarticulate hate that possessed me.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and for {{the life}} of me I could say nothing.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> blankly, whereat they murmured {{together}} and made {{as though they}} would go.|$|E
6000|$|... "Impossible," [...] <b>I</b> answered, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "It belongs {{as clear}} as day to the man {{you see in the}} photograph. How on earth could his hand be a woman's then, I'd like to know? I can see the shirt-cuff." ...|$|R
5000|$|Todd was taunted {{by other}} {{students}} {{at her school}} for her low grades, a consequence of a language-based learning disability, and for the time she spent in hospital to treat her severe depression. [...] "It didn't really help that after {{she got out of}} the hospital recently some kids started calling her 'psycho' and saying she had been in the crazy hospital," [...] her mother said. [...] "She went to the hospital, she had therapy, she had counselling, she was on a good track. On the day she gets out, that happens. <b>I</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and <b>I</b> think, 'Are kids really that nasty, do they really not think, what if it was them?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{followed}} him {{on to the}} open deck. [...] "It is quite impossible, my dear sir," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> austerely, for <b>I</b> divined his errand. [...] "I can't go and see Lady Meadowcroft. Medical etiquette, you know; the constant and salutary rule of the profession!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> emphatically, {{guessing}} that I {{was to be}} seat {{on another}} proud mission.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{and looked}} at him. His head had dropped down on his chest again.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Some {{instinct}} told me {{that they}} were professors. But I didn't say so.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{not all of}} it? Why {{sure you}} don't mean to say, Pip, {{that there was no}} black welwet co--ch?" [...] For, <b>I</b> stood <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "But at least there was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip," [...] said Joe, persuasively, [...] "if there warn't no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{getting into}} too deep waters for me, Mary," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "I'm not an {{authority}} on telepathy, or whatever you call it. But I've no belief in such theories. In fact, I think they are all nonsense. I'm sure you must think so too in your rational moments." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so, if <b>I</b> were to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> at {{you when}} you were doing any thing wrong, and you wore to {{continue}} doing it, that would be disobedience." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} at me as though asking for {{confirmation}} of her views. <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and I smiled {{down upon}} her {{a smile that}} was very full of confidence.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Mr. Dick shook his, and sighed. 'Tell {{him about}} the Memorial,' said Mr. Dick.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] <b>I</b> said, and <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{as though}} the dead eyes could note. [...] "Whatever it is, I don't {{understand}} yet. Perhaps I shall later--if you'll let me come again." ...|$|R
60|$|Curtain withdrawn, {{we looked}} each at each through the cold, {{dividing}} {{glass in the}} gloom--her eyes, in the night-spread pallor of her skin, as if congealed. The dark lips, with an exaggerated attempt at articulation, murmured words, but I could catch no meaning. The face looked almost idiotic in these contortions. <b>I</b> shuddered, <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> violently. She drew back.|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> merely <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>my</b> {{excitement}} was as dead as ditch-water, and my {{distaste for}} the prolongation of my mortal span {{had come back}} upon me more strongly than ever. Besides, we neither of us knew what {{the effects of the}} fire might be. The result upon She had not been of an encouraging nature, and of the exact causes that produced that result we were, of course, ignorant.|$|R
