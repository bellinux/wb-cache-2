In 1923 he met, and began courting, Helen Newmark, a summer-semester student at Hunter College. In order to be near her when she returned home, Rabi continued his studies at Columbia University, where his supervisor was Albert Wills. In June 1924 Rabi landed {{a job as a}} part-time tutor at the City College of New York. Wills, whose specialty was magnetism, suggested that Rabi write his doctoral thesis on the magnetic susceptibility of sodium vapor. The topic did not appeal to Rabi, but after William Lawrence Bragg gave a seminar at Columbia about the <b>electric</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of certain crystals called Tutton's salts, Rabi decided to research their magnetic susceptibility, and Wills agreed to be his supervisor.|$|E

25|$|At {{locations}} {{inside the}} charge array, to connect {{an array of}} paired charges to an approximation involving only a dipole moment density p(r) requires additional considerations. The simplest approximation is to replace the charge array with a model of ideal (infinitesimally spaced) dipoles. In particular, as in the example above that uses a constant dipole moment density confined to a finite region, a surface charge and depolarization field results. A more general version of this model (which allows the polarization to vary with position) is the customary approach using <b>electric</b> <b>susceptibility</b> or electrical permittivity.|$|E

By far the largest contribution to the susceptibilities is from the permanent dipole moment of the peptides. The results indicate that the peptides do not have rigid conformations with fixed dipoles. Instead the dipole is averaged as the peptides explore their energy landscape. For a given WG n peptide, all molecules have almost the same average dipole, which suggests that they all explore a similar energy landscape on the microsecond time scale of the measurement. The measured susceptibilities are in good overall agreement with values calculated from the average dipole moment deduced from Monte Carlo simulations...|$|R

40|$|A {{quantized}} impedance {{is proposed}} to theoretically establish {{the relationship between}} the atomic eigenfrequency and the intrinsic frequency of the one-dimensional oscillator in this paper. The classical oscillator is modified by the idea that the electron transition is treated as a charge-discharge process of a suggested capacitor with the capacitive energy equal to the energy level difference of the jumping electron. The quantized capacitance of the impedance interacting with the jumping electron can lead the resonant frequency of the oscillator to the same as the atomic eigenfrequency. The quantized resistance reflects that the damping coefficient of the oscillator is the mean collision frequency of the transition electron. In addition, the first and third order <b>electric</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> based on the oscillator are accordingly quantized. Our simulation of the hydrogen atom emission spectrum based on the proposed method agrees well with the experimental one. Our results exhibits that the one-dimensional oscillator with the quantized impedance may become useful in the estimations of the refractive index and one- or multi-photon absorption coefficients of some nonmagnetic media composed of hydrogen-like atoms...|$|R
40|$|In an {{interesting}} paper, Rutkevich obtained the electromagnetic wave {{solution for the}} compression of a magnetic field contained by an imploding, perfectly conducting cylindrical shell or liner. The magnetic and <b>electric</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> were taken as constant. The solution was obtained by Laplace transforms. In his paper, he also considered the corresponding plane problem when driving together two perfectly conducting, parallel plates that confine a magnetic field. He compared the method of solution obtained by Laplace transforms with that obtained by the method of characteristics which was used to obtain the original solution. He concluded his paper by noting that the transform method is more versatile that the characteristic method. Somewhat later, Bodulinskii and Medvedev obtained a solution for the wave structure generated when an initial magnetic field is compressed by the implosion of a conducting spherical liner. Again, the solution was obtained by transform methods. In this paper, we outline {{the solution to the}} spherical problem using the method of characteristics.

40|$|Fluctuation-dissipation theorems (FDTs) link {{transport}} coefficients (density response functions, conductivities, <b>electric</b> <b>susceptibilities,</b> etc.) to equilibrium n-point correlation functions. Of special {{importance to}} us is the applications of the FDT to one component plasmas and binary ionic mixtures. When applied to such systems, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides invaluable insight into response functions and transport coefficients across the non-equilibrium spectrum. After an in-depth review of the FDT and linear response theory, we focus upon expanding the work of K. I. Golden and G. Kalman (J. Stat. Phys. 3, 87 (1972); Annals of Phys. 141, 160 (1982)), which proposes a nonlinear response theory for magnetic field-free classical plasmas. We attempt to re-formulate the hierarchy of static fluctuation-dissipation relations in terms of external density response functions. This provides a systematic formalism for calculating higher order correlation functions in terms of lower-order ones. In future studies, we plan to derive relationships between the screened and external response functions in the RPA (or any suitable approximation method which takes account of particle correlation effects beyond the RPA). This will then {{provide insight into the}} hierarchy of static structure functions and their correlation functions...|$|R
40|$|Nonlinear optical {{frequency}} conversion, in which optical fields interact with a nonlinear medium to produce new field frequencies, is ubiquitous in modern photonic systems. However, the nonlinear <b>electric</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> that {{give rise to}} such phenomena are often challenging to tune in a given material, and so far, dynamical control of optical nonlinearities remains confined to research labs as a spectroscopic tool. Here, we report a mechanism to electrically control second-order optical nonlinearities in monolayer WSe 2, an atomically thin semiconductor. We show that the intensity of second-harmonic generation at the A-exciton resonance is tunable by over an order of magnitude at low temperature and nearly a factor of 4 at room temperature through electrostatic doping in a field-effect transistor. Such tunability arises from the strong exciton charging effects in monolayer semiconductors, which allow for exceptional control over the oscillator strengths at the exciton and trion resonances. The exciton-enhanced second-harmonic generation is counter-circularly polarized to the excitation laser, arising from the combination of the two-photon and one-photon valley selection rules that have opposite helicity in the monolayer. Our study paves the way towards a new platform for chip-scale, electrically tunable nonlinear optical devices based on two-dimensional semiconductors.

40|$|When {{the gauge}} fields have {{derivative}} couplings to scalars, {{like in the}} case of the relativistic theory of Van der Waals (or Casimir-Polder) interactions, conformal invariance is broken but the magnetic and <b>electric</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> are not bound to coincide. We analyze the formation of large-scale magnetic fields in slow-roll inflation and find that they are generated at the level of a few hundredths of a nG and over typical length scales between few Mpc and $ 100 $ Mpc. Using a new time parametrization that reduces to conformal time but only for coincident susceptibilities, the gauge action is quantized while the evolution equations of the corresponding mode functions are more easily solvable. The power spectra depend on the normalized rates of variation of the two susceptibilities (or of the corresponding gauge couplings) and on the absolute value of their ratio at the beginning of inflation. We pin down explicit regions in the parameter space where all the physical requirements (i. e. the backreaction constraints, the magnetogenesis bounds and the naturalness of the initial conditions of the scenario) are jointly satisfied. Weakly coupled initial data are favoured if the gauge couplings are of the same order at the end of inflation. Duality is systematically used to simplify the analysis of the wide parameter space of the model. Comment: 40 pages, 12 included figures; minor corrected typo...|$|R

The voltage dependence of SHG by four different probes, three retinoids (all-trans retinal), and two new retinal analogs, 3 -methyl- 7 -(4 ′-dimethylamino-phenyl) - 2, 4, 6 -heptatrienal (AR- 3) and 3, 7 -dimethyl- 9 -(4 ′-dimethylamino-phenyl) - 2, 4, 6, 8 -nonatetraenal (AR- 4), and a styryl dye (FM 4 - 64), were compared in HEK- 293 cells. Results were analyzed by fitting data with an expression based on an electrooptic mechanism for SHG, which depends on the complex-valued first- and second-order nonlinear <b>electric</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> (χ 2 and χ 3) of the probe. This gave values for the voltage sensitivity at the cell's resting potential, the voltage where the SHG is minimal, and the amplitude of the signal at that voltage {{for each of the four}} compounds. These measures show that χ 2 and χ 3 are complex numbers for all compounds except all-trans retinal, consistent with the proximities of excitation and/or emission wavelengths to molecular resonances.
