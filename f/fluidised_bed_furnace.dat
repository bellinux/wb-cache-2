The behaviour of metals in the <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> <b>furnace</b> was studied by com-paring metal concentrations in the two main ash streams: ash separated from the cyclone immediately following the <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> <b>furnace,</b> and fly ash recovered in the final bag filter. A metal enrichment factor {{was defined as the}} ratio of metal concentration between filter ash and cyclone ash. Only Cd and Pb showed any significant enrichment. Their enrichment factors were mainly affected by chlorine concentration in the feed sludge. To check whether simple equilibrium models may explain and predict metal behaviour, experimental data were compared with percentage of the metal vaporisation in the combustion chamber predicted using a thermodynamic model. Discrepancies between model predictions and experimental results are accounted for by considering that kinetics may be a limiting factor in the formation of metal chloride gaseous species.

40|$|Abstract- Nitrocarburizing is a {{thermochemical}} {{diffusion process}} involving the simultaneous addition of nitrogen and carbon {{to the surface}} of ferrous materials. The properties like better surface hardness, high wear-resistance, excellent fatigue strength, improved corrosion resistance; zero to Minimal distortion can be attained by Austenitic Nitrocarburizing (ANC). The reason is a nitrogen austenite layer is developed as substrate between the compound layer and the diffusion layer. The mild steel sample is treated on ANC under <b>Fluidised</b> <b>Bed</b> <b>Furnace</b> in various cooling rate and ageing at different temperature conditions. This effect results in variation in the microstructure of the sample after processing and in the micro hardness of the material.

The effect of carbon bearing gas (carbon dioxide, natural gas) on carbon absorption is reported, {{as well as its}} influence on compound layer growth and porosity. Partial reduction of Fe 3 O 4 at the surface resulted in the formation of a complex, epsi-nitride containing oxide layer. In H 13, carbon was deeply absorbed throughout the entire diffusion zone, affecting the growth of grain boundary cementite, nitrogen diffusivity and the sharpness of the compound layer: diffusion zone interface. When natural gas was used, carbon became highly concentrated in the compound layer, while surface decarburisation occurred with carbon dioxide. These microstructural effects are discussed in relation to hardness profiles, and compound layer hardness and ductility. The surfaces were characterised using glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy, optical and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. <br /...|$|E

The final version is available from Elsevier via [URL] capacitance tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were used to investigate two drag models used when simulating Geldart group A powders with the two fluid model.

A dense phase, bubbling <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> and a dilute phase, circulating <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> were studied. Simulations were performed using the open source software MFIX. The two drag models considered were the revised Gibilaro model and the Energy Minimisation Multiscale model.

40|$|Vacuum <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> have a {{distinct}} advantage of being operated with reduced mass consumption of the fluidising media. However, a low quality of fluidisation reduces the opportunity to utilise the bubbling regime in vacuum <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds.</b> Fluidisation maps are often used to depict the interface between the quiescent, bubbling and slugging regimes inside a <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed.</b> Such maps have been obtained by visual observations of the fluidisation interface in transparent <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds.</b> For beds which are visually inaccessible fluidisation maps are difficult to obtain. The present work therefore attempts to model the interface travel in a vacuum <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed.</b> The pressure gradient due to the bed weight has been determined to be a main contributor for fluidisation/defluidisation under vacuum. A simple analytical model based on the pressure gradient (PG model) is developed to predict the interface location in a vacuum <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed.</b> For a segregated bed, the Gibilaro-Rowe (GR) model is modified and used to predict the jetsam layer growth along with the fluidisation interface. The predictions are compared with the experimental data for minimally and highly segregated particles and it is seen that for non-segregated powders the predictions are quite accurate. Lack of sufficient knowledge of bubble characteristics, however, impeded accurate prediction of the jetsam growth especially at high flow rates.

40|$|The {{pyrolysis}} {{of biomass}} is a thermochemical process in which woody biomass is converted to several high-value products such as bio-oil, bio-char and syngas. The forestry sector has shown particular interest in this process as a large quantity of biomass is produced as an underutilised by-product in this sector annually. Dual <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> (DFBs) {{have been identified as}} a feasible reactor system for this process. However, little attention has been given to the optimisation or to the design of a scalable DFB for the pyrolysis of biomass process. Therefore, the objective of the current project was the design, modelling and construction of a scalable dual <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> system for the pyrolysis of biomass. In order to achieve this objective, several tasks were performed, which included the following: A literature study was done in order to obtain a theoretical foundation for the current project. A novel dual <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> reactor system was designed, which included the block flow diagram and the process and instrumentation diagram for the system. A cold unit of the system was built in order to test the performance of the system. A comprehensive model for the system was developed, which included mass and energy balance considerations, hydrodynamics and reaction kinetics. A complete pilot-scale system of the proposed design was built and tested at the University of Pretoria. Solids are heated by means of combustion reactions in one of the <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> in the proposed dual <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> design. An overflow standpipe is then used to transport the solids to a second <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> in order to provide the energy required for the endothermic pyrolysis reactions. The cooler solids are then fed back to the combustion <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> by means of a screw-conveyor, creating a circulating system. A two-stage model was used to model the pyrolysis reactions. In this model, the wood is converted to bio-char, syngas and tar compounds. The tar compounds are the desired product as they can be condensed to form liquid bio-oil. However, these compounds undergo a second reaction in the gas phase in which they are converted to bio-char and syngas. It is therefore necessary to quench these gases rapidly in order to maximise the yield of bio-oil obtained from the system. Bio-oil is a source of many high-value chemicals and can also be upgraded to produce liquid bio-fuels. A portion of the syngas is recycled back to the pyrolysis <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> in order to <b>fluidise</b> the <b>bed.</b> In this way, oxygen is prevented from entering the pyrolysis <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed,</b> which would cause the biomass in the bed to undergo combustion rather than pyrolysis. The operating temperatures of the combustion and pyrolysis <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> were optimised at 900 °C and 500 °C respectively. A cold unit of the system was built at the Agricultural Research Service in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, USA. From the experiments performed on this unit {{it was found that the}} solid transport mechanism designed during the project is suitable for the pyrolysis of biomass process. In addition, the solids circulation rate between the two beds was easy to control, which is necessary in order to maximise the yield of bio-oil obtained from the system. A pilot-scale unit of the dual <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> design was built in order to finalise the design and ensure that it could be scaled up. This system included all the downstream units, which had to be designed for the dual <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> system. Several cold-run experiments were also performed on the pilot-scale system in order to ensure that it would perform as required during operation. It was found that the combustion <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> could be <b>fluidised</b> as required and that the circulation of solids between the combustion and pyrolysis <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> functioned well and could be easily controlled. Therefore, it was concluded that the proposed dual <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> system is suitable for the pyrolysis of biomass process and is a feasible reactor system for the large-scale pyrolysis of biomass. The large-scale operation of the proposed dual <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> system offers several advantages, particularly within the forestry sector. These advantages have important implications, as follows: The current research offers the opportunity for the forestry sector to shift its focus from the production of traditional wood products, such as pulp and paper, to products such as specialised chemicals. The bio-oil produced in the dual <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> system can be upgraded to renewable liquid fuels, which may help reduce the dependence of the infrastructure on fossil fuels. The dual <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> system provides an opportunity for capturing and removing CO 2 from the atmosphere in the form of bio-char. It is therefore considered to be a carbon-negative process, and may help reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases. The bio-char produced in the dual <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> system can be used to feed nutrients back to plantation floors in the forestry sector, thereby aiding the growth of further plantations.

40|$|The {{demands on}} the Australian power {{industry}} to reduce green house gases have generated research into capturing carbon dioxide. Due to the high moisture content of Victorian brown coal more energy is required to dry coal than Black coal or Anthracite. The consequence of the additional energy to dry the coal {{is an increase in}} carbon dioxide emissions. It {{is for this reason that}} <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> has become a focus of interest to the Victorian power generators in the form of gasification through integrated gasification combined cycles (IGCC) or combustors. <b>Fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> technology has diverse industrial applications ranging from the gasification of coal in the power industry to chemical reactions for the plastics and oil and gas industries. Benefits of <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> are the excellent heat transfer and mixing as well as containment of the process within a pressurised vessel. The disadvantages are the complex non-linear behaviour of the gas and solids interactions that occur within the process, which are difficult to measure and predict.

The purpose of this thesis is to advance CFD modelling of <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> by accounting for phenomena that are typically neglected in CFD models. In the past multiphase Eulerian-Eulerian, gas-solid models used the kinetic theory of granular flow to describe the motion of solid within a <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed.</b> While this assumption has clearly shown to be a good approximation for dilute particle system, the kinetic theory of granular flow begins to fall short when particles begin to pack together.

Simulations of bubble growth and bed porosity through a two-dimensional <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> are validated against previous quasi static stress model and experimental measurements. Experiments were conducted in a rectangular three-dimensional gas-solid <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> to determine the behaviour of the freeboard gas after a single bubble eruption. The experiments used a particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) measurement technique to visualise and measure the gas flow within the freeboard after a single bubble eruption. The PIV method had the ability to not only measure the velocities of the gas, but also allowed the visualisation of gas vortices within the freeboard. The PIV experiments of the single bubble eruption were then used to validate CFD model of the <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed.</b> Two-dimensional and three-dimensional <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> simulations were conducted using the kinetic theory of granular flow approach including the quasi-static model and turbulence model.
