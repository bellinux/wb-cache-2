60|$|And I {{must say}} I rather admired the man’s ingenuity. With {{a box of}} tools and a few mighty simple contrivances he had made {{out to have a}} devil of a temple. Any poor Kanaka brought up here in the dark, with the harps whining all round him, and shown that smoking face {{in the bottom of a}} hole, would make no kind of doubt but he had seen and heard enough devils for a lifetime. It’s easy to find out what Kanakas think. <b>Just</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{yourself}} any way round from ten to fifteen years old, and there’s an average Kanaka. There are some pious, just as there are pious boys; and the most of them, like the boys again, are middling honest and yet think it rather larks to steal, and are easy scared and rather like to be so. I remember a boy I was at school with at home who played the Case business. He didn’t know anything, that boy; he couldn’t do anything; he had no luminous paint and no Tyrolean harps; he just boldly said he was a sorcerer, and frightened us out of our boots, and we loved it. And then it came in my mind how the master had once flogged that boy, and the surprise we were all in to see the sorcerer catch it and bum like anybody else. Thinks I to myself, “I must find some way of fixing it so for Master Case.” And the next moment I had my idea.|$|E

50|$|Through these funding rounds, {{companies}} {{do not need}} to go through an initial public offering IPO to obtain a capital or a higher valuation. They can <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their investors for more capital. IPOs also run the risk of devaluation of a company if the public market thinks a company is worth less than its investors. A couple recent examples of this was Square, best known for its mobile payments and financial services business, and Trivago, a popular German hotel search engine, both of which were priced below their initial offer prices by the market. This was because of the severe over-valuation of both companies in the private market by investors and venture capital firms. The market did not agree with both companies' valuations, and therefore, dropped the price of each stock from their initial IPO range.|$|E
