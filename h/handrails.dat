5000|$|In the mid-twentieth century, some <b>handrail</b> designs {{consisted}} of a rubber bellows, with rings of smooth metal cladding called [...] "bracelets" [...] between each coil.

40|$|Background: Holding a <b>handrail</b> {{or using}} a cane may {{decrease}} the energy cost of walking in stroke survivors. However, the factors underlying this decrease {{have not yet}} been previously identified. The purpose of the current study was to fill this void by investigating the effect of physical support (through <b>handrail</b> hold) and/or somatosensory input (through light touch contact with a <b>handrail)</b> on energy cost and accompanying changes in both step parameters and neuromuscular activity. Elucidating these aspects may provide useful insights into gait recovery post stroke. Methods: Fifteen stroke survivors participated in this study. Participants walked on a treadmill under three conditions: no <b>handrail</b> contact, light touch of the <b>handrail,</b> and firm <b>handrail</b> hold. During the trials we recorded oxygen consumption, center of pressure profiles, and bilateral activation of eight lower limb muscles. Effects of the three conditions on energy cost, step parameters and neuromuscular activation were compared statistically using conventional ANOVAs with repeated measures. In order to examine to which extent energy cost and step parameters/muscle activity are associated, we further employed a partial least squares regression analysis. Results: <b>Handrail</b> hold resulted in a significant reduction in energy cost, whereas light touch contact did not. With <b>handrail</b> hold subjects took longer steps with smaller step width and improved step length symmetry, whereas light touch contact only resulted in a small but significant decrease in step width. The EMG analysis indicated a global drop in muscle activity, accompanied by an increased constancy in the timing of this activity, and a decreased co-activation with <b>handrail</b> hold, but not with light touch. The regression analysis revealed that increased stride time and length, improved step length symmetry, and decreased muscle activity were closely associated with the decreased energy cost during <b>handrail</b> hold. Conclusion: <b>Handrail</b> hold, but not light touch, altered step parameters and was accompanied by a global reduction in muscle activity, with improved timing constancy. This suggests that the use of a <b>handrail</b> allows for a more economic step pattern that requires less muscular activation without resulting in substantial neuromuscular re-organization. <b>Handrail</b> use may thus have beneficial effects on gait economy after stroke, which cannot be accomplished through enhanced somatosensory input alone...|$|R

40|$|In 2 {{experiments}} {{the authors}} demonstrated that adaptive locomotion can involve means–ends problem solving. Sixteen-month-old toddlers crossed bridges of varying widths {{in the presence}} or absence of a <b>handrail.</b> Babies attempted wider bridges more often than narrow ones, and attempts on narrow bridges depended on <b>handrail</b> presence. Toddlers had longer latencies, examined the bridge and <b>handrail</b> more closely, and modified their gait when bridges were narrow and/or the <b>handrail</b> was unavailable. Infants who explored the bridge and <b>handrail</b> before stepping onto the bridge and devised alternative bridge-crossing strategies were more likely to cross successfully. Results challenge traditional conceptualiza-tions of tools: Babies used the <b>handrail</b> as a means for augmenting balance and for carrying out an otherwise impossible goal-directed task.

5|$|The two-tier {{steel frame}} and wooden floor Bullens Road Stand, {{designed}} by Archibald Leitch, {{was completed in}} 1926. The upper tier was seated, with terracing below, {{a part of the}} ground called The Paddock.

The stand is known for Archibald Leitch's highly distinctive balcony trusses which also act as <b>handrails</b> for the front row of seats in the Upper Bullens stand. Goodison Park is the only stadium with two complete trusses designed by Leitch. Of the 17 created, only Goodison Park, Ibrox and Fratton Park retain these trusses.|$|E
5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and <b>handrails</b> on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This project {{addressed}} an unresolved issue involving {{measurement methods}} for determining step uniformity. Leading experts on stairway safety agree {{that lack of}} step uniformity within a flight contributes to risk of missteps. A relatively new method for precisely measuring step dimensions is the nosing-to-nosing method. An issue in applying the method is lack of agreement on the lateral location to make the measurements. That location depends on where stairway users ascend and descend relative to {{the width of the}} steps. A prior investigator examined people descending to determine the lateral distance between the <b>handrail</b> center and the mid-line of the person’s body. He found the median was 44 cm. AIM: The two objectives of the experiment were to: (1) determine if a different set of stairway users will have the same median lateral distance from the <b>handrail</b> as those described in the prior observational study, and (2) determine if the lateral distance of participants is affected by their direction of travel and use of a <b>handrail.</b> METHODS: The investigators established visible distance markers on one stairway in a campus building and videotaped volunteer students ascending and descending the flight of stairs. Each of the 16 participant ascended with and without using the <b>handrail,</b> and each descended with and without using the <b>handrail.</b> Images were printed and analyzed to determine their lateral distance between the inner edge of the <b>handrail</b> and a point midway between the participant’s knees. Results were analyzed statistically to test hypotheses corresponding to the two objectives. RESULTS: The previous study found a median lateral distance of 44 cm when measured {{from the center of the}} <b>handrail.</b> Using comparable data, the median found in this study was 25 cm. Results of this study indicated that lateral distance from the <b>handrail</b> is significantly affected by the direction of travel and by use of the <b>handrail.</b> The greatest lateral distance was for ascending with the <b>handrail.</b> The shortest lateral distance was for descending without the <b>handrail.</b> VALUE: Committees develop and periodically revise standards for stairways leading to fire exits and workplace facilities. The practical value of this project is providing empirical evidence that standard developing committees may consider when convening to update their requirements and guidelines on how to measure step uniformity...|$|R

5|$|In 1901 the keeper's {{quarters}} {{went through}} major repairs, replacing the original slate tiles with terracotta ones. This was followed with {{the replacement of}} the steps handrail in 1903. A 1903 report criticised the light, saying that the red flashes were only visible for half the distance of the white ones, confusing navigators. This led to a recommendation to remove the red shades, resulting in a new characteristic of one white flash every minute, and later to upgrade the light to a quick group flashing dioptric light. Another report in 1912 stated that the station was in good condition, but criticised the low power of the light, and recommended withdrawing two of the keepers. However, all of these recommendations were not acted upon until 1 July 1922, when the apparatus was upgraded to a revolving Dalén light with an intensity of 20,000cd, and the manning reduced to two keepers. In 1932 the original gallery <b>handrails,</b> also supplied by H Wilkins & Co., were replaced with steel gas pipe and mild steel rods.|$|E

5|$|Before 1897, {{there had}} been a ferry at Grovehill, and a {{shipyard}} on the east bank, owned by Joseph Scarr. To assist his workers to reach the shipyard, Scarr designed and built a ferry bridge, which cost him £300. It consisted of a large rectangular pontoon, above which was fitted a bridge deck with <b>handrails.</b> Two jack screws enabled the deck to be raised or lowered in relation to the pontoon, so that it remained at approximately the same height, whatever the state of the tide. On the eastern bank, Scarr constructed a variable-height landing, but the landing on the west bank was constructed by Beverley Council, and was fixed. Scarr campaigned to have a variable landing here as well, and was prepared to fund it, but his requests were always rejected. The fixed landing made access to the bridge difficult at high tides. When a boat needed to pass, the west end was freed, and the pontoon swung round to lie parallel to the bank, either upstream or downstream, depending {{on the state of the}} tide. It would then be winched back into position by a small barrel winch. At night the bridge was closed and moored beside the bank.|$|E

40|$|A {{device for}} {{attaching}} an experiment carrier to {{a space station}} <b>handrail</b> is provided. The device has two major components, a clamping mechanism for attachment to a space station <b>handrail,</b> and a pointing carrier on which an experiment package can be mounted and oriented. The <b>handrail</b> clamp uses an overcenter mechanism and the carrier mechanism uses an adjustable preload ball and socket for carrier positioning. The <b>handrail</b> clamp uses a stack of disk springs to provide a spring loaded button. This configuration provides consistent clamping force over a range of possible <b>handrail</b> thicknesses. Three load points are incorporated in the clamping mechanism thereby spreading the clamping load onto three separate points on the <b>handrail.</b> A four bar linkage is used to provide for a single actuation lever for all three load points. For additional safety, a secondary lock consisting of a capture plate and push lock keeps the clamp attached to the <b>handrail</b> {{in the event of}} main clamp failure. For the carrier positioning mechanism, a ball in a spring loaded socket uses friction to provide locking torque; however. the ball and socket are torque limited so that the ball ran slip under kick loads (125 pounds or greater). A lead screw attached to disk spring stacks is used to provide an adjustable spring force on the socket. A locking knob is attached to the lead screw to allow for hand manipulation of the lead screw...|$|R
