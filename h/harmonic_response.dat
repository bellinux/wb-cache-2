However, the latter response is obtained using a tracking filter around the fundamental excitation frequency. In that case, the obtained information is generally {{a combination of the}} desired response and a contribution of a power series of <b>harmonics</b> <b>responses.</b> Moreover, the filtering procedure prevents from having higher <b>harmonics</b> <b>responses</b> whose knowledge is important in nonlinear damage characterization. In this contribution we propose a nonlinear system identification method based on an exponential swept-sine drive signal. The recorded response of the material under test is convolved with an inverse filter to obtain the nonlinear responses corresponding to the harmonics usually eliminated by the gain/phase analyzer filtering system. Therefore, a single swept-sine experiment allows to estimate higher <b>harmonics</b> <b>responses</b> (amplitude and phase) depending on the nonlinear behaviour of the material. The first measurements performed on a damaged polymer-based composite reveal that higher harmonics, generally neglected in nonlinear damage characterization because of the tracking filter, are very sensitive to damage and hence deserve more attention than usual.

30|$|The logsweep {{analysis}} {{technique is}} an ingenious device for analyzing static harmonic distortion {{as a function}} of frequency. Introduced by Farina in 2000 [2], the basic idea behind the logsweep analysis technique is to insert a logarithmic sine sweep signal with fixed amplitude to the system, and then convolve the time-reversed and amplitude weighted excitation signal with the system response. As a result, one obtains an impulse response signal, where the <b>response</b> of each <b>harmonic</b> distortion component is separated in time from the linear response and each other. If the duration of the logsweep signal is long enough, the time separation between the <b>harmonic</b> impulse <b>responses</b> is clear and it is straightforward to cut the individual <b>harmonic</b> <b>responses</b> and represent them in the frequency domain. As a result, one obtains magnitude response plots for the linear <b>response</b> and each <b>harmonic</b> distortion component.|$|R
