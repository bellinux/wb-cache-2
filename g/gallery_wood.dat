40|$|A espécie Tabebuia chrysotricha ocorre desde o Nordeste até o Sul do Brasil, na floresta pluvial atlântica e em áreas de mata de galeria na região do Cerrado, sendo disseminada pelo Brasil através de sua utilização na arborização pública. Sua madeira é resistente, usada na construção civil, também produzindo matéria corante para tingir seda e algodão. Com os objetivos de caracterizar morfologicamente e analisar a viabilidade e vigor das sementes, quando colhidas em áreas de Cerrado, elas foram medidas e colocadas para germinar recém-colhidas e 30, 60 e 90 dias após o armazenamento em laboratório e em campo, sendo também submetidas ao teste do tetrazólio. As sementes mediram, em média, 27, 8 x 7, 2 x 0, 3 mm (com alas) e 6, 4 x 4, 7 x 0, 3 mm (sem alas), e seu peso médio foi de 0, 40 g (com alas) e 0, 31 g (sem alas). As sementes apresentaram maior porcentagem de germinação acumulada (66 %) com 30 dias de armazenamento e maior estimativa de germinação a campo, quando semeadas na superfície e recém-colhidas. A viabilidade, medida através do teste de tetrazólio, apresentou resultados similares aos obtidos através do teste de germinação em laboratório, indicando ser este adequado para medir a viabilidade dessa espécie. The species Tabebuia chrysotricha {{occurs in}} the northeastern through {{southern}} Brazil in the Atlantic pluvial forest and <b>gallery</b> <b>wood</b> in the cerrado area, disseminated by arborization of streets and squares. Its wood is resistant, used in civil construction, also producing a substance pigment used for silk and cotton dyeing. The aim of this work was to morphologically characterize and analyze the viability and vigor of its seeds, when harvested in a cerrado area. The seeds were measured and germinated postharvest 30, 60 and 90 days after storage under laboratory and field conditions, being also submitted to the tetrazolium test. The seeds measured, on average, 27. 8 x 7. 2 x 0. 3 mm (with wings) and 6. 4 x 4. 7 x 0. 3 mm (without wings). Average weight was 0. 40 g (with wings) and 0. 31 g (without wings). The seeds presented greater viability under laboratory conditions 30 days after storage and higher percentage of accumulated germination under field conditions, when disseminated on the surface, during post harvest. Seed viability {{was measured by the}} tetrazolium test, and presented similar results to those obtained by the germination test, in the laboratory, indicating that it is adequate to measure viability of this species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract] The {{objective}} of this work was to characterize soil physical properties of the <b>gallery</b> <b>woods</b> area at the hydrographic Mariana sub-catchment. The physical attributes evaluated were: bulk density, gravimetric humidity, soil porosity and mechanical resistance to penetration. The field work was carried out at Alta Floresta-MT, Brazil. Nine plots of 20 m x 50 m in surface were marked along the upper and middle river course areas {{in such a way}} that they were representative of all the subcatchment extension. The experimental design was completely randomized. Soil density of the <b>gallery</b> <b>woods</b> area was higher than that of the native forest, so that development of the root system of the trees even could be restricted. Gravimetric humidity was found to be homogeneous when different areas or different depths were compared. Soil porosity was found to be adequate for native <b>gallery</b> <b>woods.</b> Mean penetration resistance at the 0 - 0. 25 m depth was classified as moderate, bout hint the upper and middle river course areas...|$|R

50|$|From A. incompertus ecology, {{fortress}} {{defense is}} likely considering they excavate <b>wood</b> <b>galleries</b> in host trees {{with just a}} single entrance. Fortress defense is sufficient to evolve eusociality when three criteria are met: food coinciding with shelter, selection for defense against intruders and predators, {{and the ability to}} defend such a habitat. The female that begins the colony bring the weevils' source of food, its symbiotic fungi, to rest in the <b>wood</b> <b>galleries</b> that it excavates. This satisfies the first criterion. Females exhibit noticeably prominent spines on their elytra, and females are the only sex to defend the galleries, possibly satisfying the second criterion. The third criterion is insufficiently studied and demonstrated. The single entrance could potentially show ability to defend, though several commensals and at least one predator have been found residing in colonies.|$|R
