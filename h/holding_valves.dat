5000|$|Counterbalance valves, {{also called}} load <b>holding</b> <b>valves</b> or {{over-center}} valves, serve as hydraulic {{resistance to the}} actuating cylinder when the load weight is required {{to be held in}} position for a period of time. These come in two distinct configurations, both highly effective in improving load handling safety during a loss of hydraulic pressure: essentially locking the lift/dump cylinder in-place, preventing potential free fall of the load in the event of hydraulic failure.|$|E

40|$|Ramonalina n. gen. {{is a large}} thick-shelled bivalve {{abundant}} in mounds preserved in the Gevanim Formation (late Anisian, Middle Triassic) of southern Israel. This bivalve was an edgewise-recliner with a flattened anteroventral (functionally basal) surface and partially fused valves. It {{is the basis of}} a new family, the Ramonalinidae, which is descended from the myalinids through adaptation to edgewise positioning. Ligamental attachment was inadequate to <b>hold</b> <b>valves</b> together on large adults, resulting in valve displacement followed by shell secretion in the apical area that fused valves together and caused irregular growth on abapical areas. The ramonalinids formed large, nearly monospecific mounds on firm mud substrates in shallow marine waters. These are the largest Middle Triassic bivalve mounds known...|$|R
50|$|Solenoid valves may use metal seals or rubber seals, and {{may also}} have {{electrical}} interfaces to allow for easy control. A spring {{may be used to}} <b>hold</b> the <b>valve</b> opened (normally open) or closed (normally closed) while the valve is not activated.|$|R
50|$|The Cockburn Improved High Lift {{design has}} similar {{features}} to the Ross pop type. The exhaust steam is partially trapped {{on its way}} out and acts {{on the base of}} the spring seat, increasing the lift force on the <b>valve</b> and <b>holding</b> the <b>valve</b> further open.|$|R
40|$|An {{intake valve}} {{arrangement}} for positively controlling {{the opening and}} closing of the poppet valve in a hot gas cylinder in a hydrazine powered engine is described. The poppet valve is operated by the piston and gas pressure only. The poppet valve uses a pneumatic spring which <b>holds</b> the poppet <b>valve</b> against the piston while the valve is opened and closed. To accomplish this, a poppet valve is slidably mounted in a pneumatic spring chamber which reaches a pressure approaching the gas supply pressure and, during {{the opening of the}} valve, the spring chamber retains enough pressure to <b>hold</b> the poppet <b>valve</b> onto the piston. In addition, the bottom of the poppet valve can have a suction cup type configuration to <b>hold</b> the poppet <b>valve</b> on the piston during the down stroke...|$|R
50|$|The bleeder brake is a {{simplified}} version of traditional engine brakes.

50|$|These operate by {{the varying}} {{viscosity}} of liquids and gases and {{are designed for}} situations, such as fire truck hoses, {{where there is a}} large flow and a large quantity of air to be vented rapidly.

50|$|Other units use a non-electrical approach, {{where the}} pilot heats a {{bimetallic}} element or a gas-filled tube to exert mechanical pressure {{to keep the}} gas valve open. If the pilot fails, the valve closes. To restart the system, the valve must be held open manually and the pilot lit, and then the valve must be held open until the element heats up enough to <b>hold</b> the <b>valve</b> open. Non-electrical schemes are appropriate for systems that do not use electricity.|$|R
5000|$|A resilifer {{is a part}} of {{the shell}} of certain bivalve mollusks. It is either a recess (a pit or groove of some sort) or a process, the {{function}} of which is the attachment of an internal ligament, which <b>holds</b> the two <b>valves</b> together.|$|R
50|$|Spring-loaded {{pressure}} {{safety valves}} use a compressed spring to <b>hold</b> the <b>valve</b> closed. The valve will remain closed until the process pressure exceeds the set {{point of the}} spring pressure. The valve will open 100% when the set point is reached and will remain open until a certain blow down factor is reached. Oftentimes the blow down is {{a percentage of the}} set point, such as 20% of the set point. That means that the valve will remain open until the process pressure decreases to 20% below the set point of the spring-loaded relief valve.|$|R
5000|$|The gas is self-administered {{through a}} demand valve, using a mouthpiece, bite block or face mask. [...] Self-administration of Entonox is safe because if enough is inhaled {{to start to}} induce anaesthesia, the patient becomes unable to <b>hold</b> the <b>valve,</b> and so will drop it and soon exhale the {{residual}} gas. This means that unlike other anaesthetic gases, {{it does not require}} the presence of an anaesthetist for administration. The 50% oxygen in Entonox ensures the patient will have sufficient oxygen in their system {{for a short period of}} apnea (or apnoea) to be safe.|$|R
5000|$|Use of a pilot {{generator}} or a thermocouple in {{the flame}} provides heating appliance safety as it generates enough electric current {{from the burning}} flame to <b>hold</b> the gas <b>valve</b> open.

5000|$|How hit-and-miss engines work: The {{intake valve}} on hit-and-miss engines has no actuator; instead, a light spring <b>holds</b> the intake <b>valve</b> closed unless a vacuum in the {{cylinder}} draws it open. This vacuum only occurs if the exhaust valve is closed during the piston's down-stroke. When the hit-and-miss engine is operating above its set speed, the governor <b>holds</b> the exhaust <b>valve</b> open, preventing a vacuum in the cylinder and causing the intake valve to remain closed, thus interrupting the Otto cycle firing mechanism. When {{the engine is}} operating at or below its set speed, the governor allows the exhaust valve to close. On the next down-stroke a vacuum in the cylinder will open the intake valve and let the fuel-air mixture enter. This mechanism prevents fuel consumption during the intake stroke of [...] "miss" [...] cycles.|$|R
50|$|The {{chordae tendineae}} are {{attached}} to papillary muscles that cause tension to better <b>hold</b> the <b>valve.</b> Together, the papillary muscles and the chordae tendineae are known as the subvalvular apparatus. The function of the subvalvular apparatus {{is to keep the}} valves from prolapsing into the atria when they close. The subvalvular apparatus has no effect on the opening and closure of the valves, however, which is caused entirely by the pressure gradient across the valve. The peculiar insertion of chords on the leaflet free margin, however, provides systolic stress sharing between chords according to their different thickness.|$|R
50|$|The oldest engine {{technological}} predecessor for the variable-displacement {{engine is}} the {{hit and miss}} engine, developed in the late 19th century. These single-cylinder stationary engines had a centrifugal governor that cut the cylinder out of operation {{so long as the}} engine was operating above a set speed, typically by <b>holding</b> the exhaust <b>valve</b> open.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Decreasing {{electrostatic}} charge on <b>valved</b> <b>holding</b> chambers increases {{the amount of}} drug delivered. However, there are no data demonstrating that this increases bronchodilatation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of reducing {{electrostatic charge}} on the bronchodilator response to albuterol inhaler during nocturnal bronchospasm. METHODS: This randomized dou-ble-blind, double-dummy crossover study included subjects, 18 – 40 years old, with nocturnal bron-chospasm (20 % overnight decrease in peak flow on 3 of 7 nights during run-in), FEV 1 60 – 80 % predicted during the day, and> 12 % increase after albuterol. Subjects slept in the clinical research center up to 3 nights for each treatment. FEV 1 and heart rate were measured upon awakening spontaneously or at 4 : 00 AM, and 15 min after each dose of 1, 2, and 4 cumulative puffs of albuterol via metered-dose inhaler. The drug was administered through an anti-static <b>valved</b> <b>holding</b> cham-ber (AeroChamber Plus Z-Stat) or a conventional <b>valved</b> <b>holding</b> chamber containing a static charge (AeroChamber Plus). RESULTS: Of 88 consented subjects, 11 were randomized and 7 completed the study. Most exclusions were {{due to lack of}} objective evidence of nocturnal broncho-spasm. Upon awakening, FEV 1 was 44 9 % of predicted before the anti-static chamber and 48 7 % of predicted before the static chamber.

50|$|Although {{the opening}} {{time of a}} bash valve is fixed, imprecisely {{controlled}} and always occurs near top dead centre, {{this is not a}} major drawback for a steam engine. A more important requirement is the ability to accurately control the closing time of the valve, and for its duration to be adjustable in order to 'drive' the engine, according to varying load. Some designs of uniflow engine have used a combined mechanical and electromagnetic valve to do this. The valve is opened mechanically, then held by an electromagnet. This requires less electrical power to merely <b>hold</b> the <b>valve</b> than to open it. A patent for such an engine was granted to Sturtevant in 1968.|$|R
50|$|When first developed, ECP brakes {{needed a}} number of wires along the train to control {{solenoids}} on each wagon to release the brakes, and were not considered economic for freight.

50|$|Abra alba {{can grow}} {{to up to}} 2.5 cm long but a more usual size is 1.5 centimetres. It has a pair of thin brittle valves that are translucent, semi-shiny and a dirty white colour with a pale brown periostracum. The shape is roughly oval and the {{posterior}} and anterior dorsal margins are almost straight and slope to rounded ends. Both margins are smooth and the anterior margin is {{a little longer than}} the posterior one. The valves have a sculpture of fine concentric lines and the growth stages of the animal are visible. The interior of the valves is somewhat glossy and the adductor muscle scars may be visible. The small brown ligament that <b>holds</b> the <b>valves</b> together is exterior.|$|R
50|$|Trickle valves can be {{used only}} on systems {{operating}} under negative pressure. The vacuum created inside the dust collector <b>holds</b> the <b>valve</b> closed, allowing a head of material to build up above the trickle valve. Once {{the pressure of the}} material equals the negative pressure of the system, the valve is forced open and a trickle of material will begin flowing from the valve at the same rate it is collected. The magnitude of the vacuum of the system and the bulk density of the material being handled determine how much material will build up before the valve begins to discharge. Because trickle valves work automatically and require no power source or controls, they have very low initial cost and virtually no operating cost.|$|R
25|$|Scuba demand valves {{which are}} set to breathe lightly (low {{cracking}} pressure, and low work of breathing) may tend to free-flow relatively easily, particularly if the gas flow in the housing {{has been designed to}} assist in <b>holding</b> the <b>valve</b> open by reducing the internal pressure. The cracking pressure of a sensitive demand valve is often less than the hydrostatic pressure difference between the inside of an air-filled housing and the water below the diaphragm when the mouthpiece is pointed upwards. To avoid excessive loss of gas due to inadvertent activation of the valve when the DV is out of the diver's mouth, some second stages have a desensitising mechanism which causes some back-pressure in the housing, by impeding the flow or directing it against the inside of the diaphragm.|$|R
50|$|Air pilot control: {{converting}} {{from air}} to oil results in locking of the cylinder. Shifting the four-way valve to either extreme position applies the air pilot through the shuttle <b>valve,</b> <b>holding</b> the two air-operated valves open and applying oil under air {{pressure to the}} corresponding side of the cylinder. Positioning a manual valve to neutral exhausts the air pilot pressure, closing the two-way valves, and trapping oil {{on both sides of}} the cylinder to lock it in position.|$|R

50|$|Pisaster ochraceus {{uses its}} tube feet to handle its prey. If the prey {{is too large}} to be {{swallowed}} whole, then it can use its tube feet to open shells. It can evert its stomach through its mouth and engulf its prey, liquify it with digestive enzymes and ingest the processed food. Mussels <b>hold</b> their <b>valves</b> together very securely but Pisaster ochraceus can insert part of its everted stomach, or some digestive juices, through the narrow gap that exists where the byssal threads emerge from the shell. The mussel needs to open its valves periodically to feed and breathe and the sea star can exert a powerful traction with its tube feet, pulling the two valves further open. Once the stomach is inside the mussel, digestion takes place. It is thought one sea star can consume eighty Californian mussels in a year.|$|R

The claim must be confined to the specific device described in the specification and claim—namely a pinhole and pin. If this construction of the claim be adopted, it is clear that no infringement is shown, for the appellees do not use a pinhole and pin for <b>holding</b> their <b>valve</b> open or closed, but a screw, sleeve, or cap, and therefore one of the elements of the combination, covered by the second claim of appellant's patent, is wanting in the device used by the appellees.|$|R
