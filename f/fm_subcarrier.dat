50|$|Usually {{there are}} four FM {{transmit}} channels, A, B, C & D, with stereo audio on 6.0 MHz and 6.5 MHz <b>FM</b> <b>subcarriers</b> added to the composite video baseband. These different channels can often be used to overcome the adverse effects of nearby WiFi networks.|$|R
50|$|Two musical programs, {{consisting}} {{of both the}} Red and Blue Network program feeds of the NBC Radio Network, were simultaneously transmitted using the same system of subcarrier modulation {{as part of a}} studio-to-transmitter link system. In April 1935, the AM subcarriers were replaced by <b>FM</b> <b>subcarriers,</b> with much improved results.|$|R
5000|$|Other <b>FM</b> <b>subcarriers</b> (usually 7.02, 7.20, 7.38, 7.56, 7.74 and 7.92 MHz) {{are added}} for a true-stereo service {{and can also}} carry multi-lingual sound and radio services. These {{additional}} subcarriers are normally narrower bandwidth than the main mono subcarrier and are companded using Panda 1 or similar to preserve the signal-to-noise ratio ...|$|R
50|$|In Canada, HMWN Radio Maria, the Toronto-based English-language <b>FM</b> <b>subcarrier</b> {{and cable}} service, airs Radio Maria USA {{programming}} from KJMJ during overnight hours and on weekends.|$|E
50|$|Multicultural {{kept the}} Korean format {{but after a}} few years, in 2002, {{switched}} to Chinese and now in Cantonese (to complement Multicultural's Sinocast network broadcast locally on 92.3 <b>FM</b> <b>subcarrier).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Radio Maria Chicago, a Spanish-language unit of Radio Maria USA, a Catholic radio network, is also {{broadcast}} on WOJO's <b>FM</b> <b>subcarrier.</b> Radio Maria Chicago commenced broadcasting on the WOJO subcarrier and online on December 8, 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Before satellite, Muzak {{and similar}} {{services}} was transmitted to department stores on <b>FM</b> <b>subcarriers.</b> The fidelity of the subcarrier audio was limited {{compared to the}} primary FM radio audio channel. [...] The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also allowed betting parlors in New York state to get horse racing results from the state gaming commission via the same technology.|$|R
5000|$|WRRS is an FM {{radio station}} {{licensed}} to Middleborough Center, Massachusetts and {{is owned by}} Talking Information Center, Incorporated. WRRS operates with 400 watts on 88.5 MHz (Channel 203). It broadcasts programming from the Talking Information Center, a radio reading service for blind people normally heard on <b>F.M.</b> <b>subcarriers.</b> WRRS was granted its callsign on October 29, 2010. [...] It began broadcasting in 2012. WRRS went silent as of December 28, 2016.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 28 - 30, 1982 / Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaA bubble-memory {{recorder}} {{for data}} {{taken from a}} parachute-measurement system is used to replace UHF telemetry using <b>FM</b> <b>subcarriers.</b> Significant savings in manpower for the test results, along with greater data quality and simpler, more repeatable data playback. New devices and a ground-based playback decommutator provide greater utility and normally end the requirement for a ground station...|$|R
50|$|Sound is on a <b>FM</b> <b>subcarrier</b> as in {{terrestrial}} transmission, but frequencies above 4.5 MHz {{are used}} to reduce aural/visual interference. 6.8, 5.8 and 6.2 MHz are commonly used. Stereo can be multiplex, discrete, or matrix and unrelated audio and data signals may be placed on additional subcarriers.|$|E
50|$|A-MAC {{carries the}} digital information: sound, data-teletext on an <b>FM</b> <b>subcarrier</b> at 7 MHz. Since the vision {{bandwidth}} {{of a standard}} MAC signal is 8.4 MHz, the horizontal resolution on A-MAC has to be reduced {{to make room for}} the 7 MHz carrier. A-MAC has not been used in service.|$|E
5000|$|WRMW {{began as}} a {{construction}} permit licensed in May 2007 to its founder [...] "Friends of Radio Maria" [...] (which also airs Italian language Catholic programming on the <b>FM</b> <b>subcarrier</b> of New York station WKTU and on the internet.) WRMW is now owned and operated (and licensed to) Radio Maria Inc.|$|E
50|$|Sidebands {{can also}} {{interfere}} with adjacent channels. The {{part of the}} sideband that would overlap the neighboring channel must be suppressed by filters, before or after modulation (often both). In Broadcast band frequency modulation (<b>FM),</b> <b>subcarriers</b> above 75 kHz are limited to {{a small percentage of}} modulation and are prohibited above 99 kHz altogether to protect the ±75 kHz normal deviation and ±100 kHz channel boundaries. Amateur radio and public service FM transmitters generally utilize ±5 kHz deviation.|$|R
40|$|Preemphasis {{schedules}} {{are given}} for 11 constant-bandwidth <b>FM</b> <b>subcarriers</b> modulating an S-band transmitter at various receiver SNRs (9 dB, 15 dB and 25 dB). The criterion for establishing these preemphasis curves is the achievement, at various receiver IF SNR, of equal receiver output SNR for all channels. The empirically derived results are {{compared with a}} simplified, analytically derived schedule and the primary differences are explained. The S-band preemphasis schedule is also found to differ from the lower frequency VHF case...|$|R
50|$|Some utility {{stations}} are on other frequency bands, including NOAA Weather Radio, traveler information stations, and the like; other utility-type signals are piggybacked on <b>FM</b> broadcast <b>subcarriers.</b>|$|R
50|$|KOTV's {{audio signal}} {{could be heard}} on 87.75 MHz on the FM band in Tulsa and the {{surrounding}} areas prior to the digital switchover, digital television does not place its audio on an <b>FM</b> <b>subcarrier</b> as the analog system typically does and therefore television stations operating a digital signal cannot be heard using standard broadcast FM radio receivers.|$|E
50|$|Its United States of America {{operations}} {{is one of}} the newest joining the World Family in May 2000 with KJMJ (AM) in Alexandria, Louisiana being the originating English-language station, together with a network of several FM and AM repeaters in Louisiana, an AM station in Port Arthur, Texas on 1250 AM (KDEI), and an FM repeater in Anna, Ohio. An AM repeater in Springfield, Ohio east of Dayton commenced broadcasting in June 2008 with new FM repeaters in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania coming on the air in June 2009, D'Iberville, Mississippi and Peshtigo, Wisconsin both in May 2010. Spanish-language and Italian-language programming is heard on <b>FM</b> <b>subcarrier</b> frequencies in Boston, Chicago, Houston, New York City and Washington, D.C.. Italian-language programming can also be heard on New York City <b>FM</b> <b>subcarrier</b> as well as French Canadian and English speaking services on FM subcarriers in Toronto, Ontario. Audiostreaming is available from most of these stations.|$|E
50|$|KNIR was {{the first}} AM station to {{simulcast}} KJMJ, thus forming repeater network Radio Maria USA,the English language unit of Radio Maria Inc. based in Como, Italy. Radio Maria USA programming is also heard in Canada in the evenings and weekends on Toronto-based HMWN Radio Maria, which broadcasts on an <b>FM</b> <b>subcarrier</b> of CFNY-FM and on cable and on internet throughout the Canadian provinces.|$|E
50|$|Business audio is {{produced}} off-site and {{delivered to the}} client via a number of methods including DBS satellite, SDARS satellite, coaxial cable, <b>FM</b> radio <b>subcarrier,</b> leased line, internet broadband, compact disc, and tape.|$|R
50|$|The total RF {{bandwidth}} of System I (as {{originally designed}} with its single <b>FM</b> audio <b>subcarrier)</b> was about 7.4 MHz, allowing System I signals to be transmitted in 8.0 MHz wide channels with an ample 600 kHz guard zone between channels.|$|R
5000|$|These FM {{multiplex}} transmissions {{started in}} November 1934 {{and consisted of}} the main channel audio program and three subcarriers: a fax program, a synchronizing signal for the fax program and a telegraph [...] "order" [...] channel. These original <b>FM</b> multiplex <b>subcarriers</b> were amplitude modulated.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{termination}} of the station's analog broadcasts, XETV's audio signal could be heard at 87.75 MHz on the FM band in San Diego, Tijuana and surrounding areas, though at a slightly lower volume than other FM radio stations. Unlike the digital ATSC standard, analog NTSC carried its sound on an <b>FM</b> <b>subcarrier</b> and TV 6 (82-88 MHz) is adjacent to the standard broadcast FM band.|$|E
50|$|Regarding early (analog) videodiscs, the {{established}} Laserdisc standard supported only NTSC and PAL. However, a different optical disc format, the Thomson transmissive optical disc made a brief {{appearance on the}} market. At some point, it used a modified SECAM signal (single <b>FM</b> <b>subcarrier</b> at 3.6 MHz). The media's flexible and transmissive material allowed for direct access to both sides without flipping the disc, a concept that reappeared in multi-layered DVDs about fifteen years later.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>FM</b> <b>subcarrier</b> {{transmissions}} {{emanating from}} Major Armstrong's experimental station KE2XCC at Alpine, New Jersey occurred in 1948. These transmissions consisted of two-channel audio programs, binaural audio programs and a fax program. The original subcarrier frequency used at KE2XCC was 27.5 kHz. The IF bandwidth was +/-5 kHz, {{as the only}} goal {{at the time was}} to relay AM radio-quality audio. This transmission system notably used a 75 microsecond audio pre-emphasis, a technical innovation that became part of the original FM Stereo Multiplex Standard.|$|E
5000|$|Elving {{was also}} noted for his mail order sales of radios {{modified}} to receive subcarrier signals emanating from FM radio stations. These little-known signals, which require special receiving equipment to hear, often consist of background music for retail establishments, newsfeeds, and reading {{services for the}} blind. Elving advocated these services as superior to newer technology such as HD Radio. In March 1989, Monitoring Times published an article by Elving entitled [...] "SCA: FM Radio's Alter-Ego - The Radio the FCC Doesn't Want You to Own." [...] In 1997 Elving was quoted in a New York Times article discussing Radio Data System (RDS) signals, which ride on <b>FM</b> <b>subcarriers</b> and were thought for a time to be the future of radio.|$|R
50|$|The total RF {{bandwidth}} of System B (as {{originally designed}} with its single <b>FM</b> audio <b>subcarrier)</b> was 6.5 MHz, allowing System B to be transmitted in the 7.0 MHz wide channels specified for {{television in the}} VHF bands with an ample 500 kHz guard zone between channels.|$|R
50|$|A single {{performance}} of a dramatic literary work may be transmitted specifically for the blind or other handicapped persons if the work was published at least 10 years before {{the date of the}} performance, there is no direct or indirect commercial advantage, and the transmission is made through an <b>FM</b> radio <b>subcarrier</b> as defined in paragraph 8.|$|R
