40|$|A global {{cellular}} reorganization {{occurs during}} the reticulocyte stage of erythroid differentiation. This reorganization is accomplished partly through programmed protein degradation. The selection of proteins for degradation can be mediated by covalent attachment of ubiquitin. We have cloned cDNAs encoding two ubiquitin-conjugating (E 2) enzymes, E 2 - 20 K and <b>E</b> 2 - <b>230</b> K, and found their genes to be strongly induced during the differentiation of erythroblasts into reticulocytes.

40|$|The {{survival}} protein SurE from Salmonella typhimurium (StSurE) is a dimeric {{protein that}} {{functions as a}} phosphatase. SurE dimers are formed by the swapping of a loop {{with a pair of}} beta-strands and a C-terminal helix between two protomers. In a previous study, the Asp 230 and His 234 residues were mutated to Ala to abolish a hydrogen bond that was thought to be crucial for C-terminal helix swapping. These mutations led to functionally inactive and distorted dimers in which the two protomers were related by a rotation of 167 degrees. New salt bridges involving Glu 112 were observed in the dimeric interface of the H 234 A and D 230 A/H 234 A mutants. To explore the role of these salt bridges in the stability of the distorted structure, E 112 A, <b>E</b> 112 A/D <b>230</b> A, <b>E</b> 112 A/H 234 A, <b>E</b> 112 A/D <b>230</b> A/H 234 A, R 179 L/H 180 A/H 234 A and E 112 A/R 179 L/H 180 A/H 234 A mutants were constructed. X-ray crystal structures of the E 112 A, E 112 A/H 234 A and <b>E</b> 112 A/D <b>230</b> A mutants could be determined. The dimeric structures of the E 112 A and E 112 A/H 234 A mutants were similar to that of native SurE, while the <b>E</b> 112 A/D <b>230</b> A mutant had a residual rotation of 11 degrees between the B chains upon superposition of the A chains of the mutant and native dimers. The native dimeric structure was nearly restored in the E 112 A/H 234 A mutant, suggesting that the new salt bridge observed in the H 234 A and D 230 A/H 234 A mutants was indeed responsible for the stability of their distorted structures. Catalytic activity was also restored in these mutants, implying that appropriate dimeric organization is necessary for the activity of SurE...|$|R
40|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} myotonia congenita is {{an inherited}} disorder of skeletal muscle caused by mutations in a voltage-gated Cl− channel gene (CLCN 1, 7 q 35).

The G <b>230</b> <b>E</b> mutation causes substantial changes in anion and cation selectivity {{as well as a}} fundamental change in rectification of the current–voltage relationship.

Furthermore, the cation-to-anion permeability ratio of the mutant is much greater than that of the wild-type channel. Voltage-dependent blocks by intracellular and extracellular iodide help to distinguish two distinct ion binding sites within the hClC- 1 conduction pathway.

40|$|The human fungal {{microbiota}} {{known as}} mycobiota is increasingly {{recognized as a}} critical factor in human gut health and disease. Non-pathogenic commensal yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae promote homeostasis in the gut, whereas dysbiosis of the gut mycobiota is associated with inflammation. Glycan-binding receptors (lectins) are key host factors in host–mycobiota interaction in the gut. They are expressed on immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) and recognize fungal polysaccharides. This interaction is imperative to mount appropriate immune responses for immune homeostasis in the gut as well as clearance of fungal pathogens. Recent studies demonstrate that microtubule-associated protein light-chain 3 (LC 3) -associated phagocytosis (LAP) is involved in lectin–fungi interactions. Yet, the biological impact of LAP on the lectin function remains largely elusive. In this report, we demonstrate that in mouse LAP is linked to dendritic cell-associated lectin 2 (Dectin- 2), a C-type lectin specific to fungal α-mannan polysaccharide. We found that mouse Dectin- 2 recognizes commensal yeast S. cerevisiae and Kazachstania unispora. Mouse bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) produced inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL- 1 β in response to the yeasts in a Dectin- 2 and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) -dependent manner. We found that S. cerevisiae and K. [*]unispora induced LAP in mouse BMDCs upon internalization. Furthermore, LC 3 was activated by stimulation of BMDCs with the yeasts in a Dectin- 2 and Syk-dependent manner. To address the biological impact of LAP on Dectin- 2 yeast interaction, we established a knock-in mouse strain (Atg 16 L 1 <b>E</b> <b>230,</b> thereafter called <b>E</b> <b>230),</b> which BMDCs exhibit autophagy-active and LAP-negative phenotypes.

40|$|A modularized {{approach}} to modeling of harmonics in electrical distribution networks at steady state is presented. It {{is based on}} harmonic balance and exploits that the loads in a distribution network are connected in parallel {{in such a way}} that their operating conditions are approximately known in advance (<b>e.</b> g. <b>230</b> V, 50 Hz) and the harmonic distortion of the voltage is limited. The model for a component is given by a linear relation between the Fourier coefficients of the deviations from nominal current and voltage. The linear relationship implies that aggregation of loads and network solving are a matter of solving linear equation systems. This leads to fast calculations without convergence problems...|$|R
