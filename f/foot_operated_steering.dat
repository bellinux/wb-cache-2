When comes to performance of <b>steering</b> <b>operating</b> system,this paper mainly consider the steering wheel torque,aiming at doing a research to find if this system can output a certain value of steering wheel torque. This paper build a model of <b>steering</b> <b>operating</b> system,get a transfer function of this system with parameter identification,and analyze its frequency response characteristic. Finally conduct a test about the real performance of <b>steering</b> <b>operating</b> system...|$|R

50|$|The {{body was}} driven by two 2 ft wide tracks and on the surface {{steering}} was possible by means of dog clutches on the gear-box output shafts. When digging, only small changes in direction were possible by means of hydraulically <b>operated</b> <b>steering</b> doors, {{one on each side}} of the machine. There was an arrangement to draw an adjustable amount of spoil back into the trench and under the vehicle's tracks so as to counter any tendency to heel over.|$|R

50|$|For {{motorcycles}} with sidecars, {{especially for}} motorcycles {{which have been}} retrofitted with a sidecar and where the front wheel geometry, or trail, has not been adjusted for use with a sidecar, a steering damper is beneficial. This prevents low speed wobble which may occur in the lower speed range of about 13 to 20 mph. In older motorcycles adjustable friction dampers had been routinely installed. Hydraulically <b>operated</b> <b>steering</b> dampers may be retrofitted. In some jurisdictions, the installation and operation of a steering damper must be inspected by an expert or examiner and must be entered in the vehicle papers.|$|R

50|$|Left-foot braking is the {{technique}} of using the left <b>foot</b> to <b>operate</b> the brake pedal in an automobile, leaving the right foot dedicated to the throttle pedal. It contrasts with the practice of using the left <b>foot</b> to <b>operate</b> the clutch pedal, leaving the right foot to share the duties of controlling both brake and accelerator pedals.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{developed}} as a racing prototype, the production model was essentially a race replica. Various modifications and improvements were made over the ten years of production. Early models had a 'pent roof' four valve head, with two pairs of valves operating on parallel slopes like a 'pitched roof', which was replaced in 1932 with a radial four valve head and an option of a <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> gear change. This <b>foot</b> pedal <b>operated</b> both {{the front and rear}} brakes, with a hand lever also operating the front brake. With a top speed of over , the Rudge Ulster was advertised as [...] "probably the fastest 500cc motorcycle in production".|$|R
50|$|She {{was then}} {{the first of the}} fleet to be {{modified}} to burn bunker oil and coal tar; between 8 March and 3 August 1939 Baragoola was altered to an oil burner using tar under natural draught, like the Curl Curl, Dee Why and South Steyne. Propellers of improved design were also fitted at this time. Other modifications included in 1948 the removal of her chain <b>operated</b> <b>steering</b> gear that were replaced with Brown Brothers (later known as Vickers) hydraulic equipment. In 1958, it was withdrawn for a rebuild by which included the replacement of its steam engines with English Electric 7SKM diesel-electric engines. It returned to service in 1961.|$|R
50|$|Its {{fuselage}} {{was built}} from GRP/balsa sandwich. The FVA-20 had a T-tail, their planes built {{as those of}} the wings. The tailplane was fixed, carrying elevators fitted with Háhnle trim tabs. Its single seat cockpit was enclosed by a single-piece, forward hinged canopy. It landed on a retractable, unsprung, monowheel undercarriage aided by a tail bumper. The mainwheel had a <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> brake.|$|R
50|$|The modern timpani {{evolved in}} the 18th and 19th centuries from the simple 12th-century membranophone of the Naker to a complex instrument, {{consisting}} of a suspended kettle with a <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> clutch, capable of rapid tuning. The technological evolution of the instrument led to increased interest in its capabilities and sound among such composers as Ludwig van Beethoven, Robert Schumann, and Hector Berlioz.|$|R

50|$|The first Austel 1000 MK1 {{prototype}} {{was built}} in 1981 for Chris's own use and this was closely by the MK2 which was built for local businessman John Kemp. These bikes had 1000cc Mini engines with <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> automatic gear boxes (including reverse), side mounted radiators, chain drive, Yamaha alloy wheels, Austel leading link forks and were named Lotec due to the simplicity of design.|$|R
50|$|Unusually, {{for this}} class of vehicle, all {{versions}} were equipped with a very reliable fully automatic three-speed gearbox, with the primary method of drive being a chain.The CS50 and CS80 are virtually mechanically identical, the main differences being a two-person seat, larger brakes (<b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> on rear) and larger headlight on CS80. The CS125 is almost entirely different and shares very few interchangeable parts.|$|R

A cast is made of the foot and is used to produce an orthotic device that is shaped to the static neutral foot structure of the individual. A degree of posting is typically applied to place the foot and leg in neutral alignment during weight-bearing. A...|$|R
50|$|The European Chrysler Voyager {{was first}} {{released}} in 1988, {{nearly identical to}} its American counterpart, the Plymouth Voyager; the only visual {{differences between the two}} were the head/taillights and grille. Besides the slightly different appearance, the European Voyagers were sold with different engines, including diesel engines, which are popular in Europe; and the trim was different. They were also available with manual transmission and a <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> emergency brake.|$|R
50|$|The gearbox {{of the car}} {{was also}} novel, having dual {{epicyclic}} gears and being bolted directly to the engine. This allowed four speeds, with direct drive in top gear. All the gears were helical, and enclosed in an oil bath, making for very silent transmission. Reverse gear was built into the rear axle, as was the <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> brake drum, all of which was housed in a substantial aluminium casing.|$|R
