40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the short- and long-run {{relationship between}} inbound tourism and total {{exports of goods}} in <b>general,</b> and <b>exports</b> of agro-food products in particular. An empirical study was conducted using monthly data on inbound tourism, total exports of goods, and exports of agro-food products for the period between 2000 and 2012, in Portugal. The results reveal that inbound tourism and exports of agro-food products are cointegrated. Therefore a long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables can be inferred. The Granger causality test results suggest that inbound tourism in Portugal stimulates growth of <b>exports</b> in <b>general.</b> Furthermore, <b>exports</b> of goods and exports of agro-food products also stimulate inbound tourism. Our empirical findings provide important policy implications concerning international tourism and trade. inbound tourism; exports; agro-food products; cointegration; Granger causality; Portugal; international tourism; trade...|$|R

30|$|With the {{prevalence}} of processing trade, any measurement based on aggregate results, combining processing exports and other production, could highly overstate China’s economic benefits. Developing a framework to separate the production of Chinese processing <b>exports</b> from <b>general</b> <b>exports</b> so that the total domestic value added (short as DVA) from exports can be measured more accurately is therefore critical. Lau et al. (2006) developed a non-competitive input–output table that captures the Chinese processing trade (known as the DPN table). It differentiates input structures concerning production for domestic use, processing exports, and normal exports, facilitating the study of China’s exported DVA. This methodology was subsequently adopted, directly or indirectly and with variations, by other researchers working on similar and related topics (Koopman et al. 2008; Dean et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2012; Duan et al. 2012; Mu and Yang 2014).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the exporting behaviour of Russian manufacturers {{by considering the}} interaction of firm characteristics and external conditions. An important distinction is made between <b>general</b> <b>exporting</b> activity and export to developed countries. Firm features and specific export experience {{are found to be}} important in determining the international orientation of manufacturers and the destination of their exports. At the same time, agglomeration effects are relevant in determining the share of transactions directed to more developed markets, indicating that more efficient exporters are agglomerated in regional and industrial clusters. Among external conditions, natural resource dependence does not seem incompatible with a diversified industrial structure, while a lower degree of regulatory capture is found to favour orientation towards more developed markets. A final section takes a specific look at the new enterprise sector, and finds institutional conditions to be an important determinant of its exporting behaviour...|$|R

50|$|Before any {{legislation}} regulating e-waste was enacted, {{companies could}} directly export their e-waste to recycling or landfill hubs. After regulation measures were introduced, {{the majority of}} exports are done through either certified e-waste handlers or uncertified handlers. The largest two competing certified handlers are e-stewards and Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI). ISRI represents {{some of the largest}} waste handlers because they are in trade with Asia and Africa. Although many recycling programs have increased in efficiency, loopholes still exist within the recycling program that allow companies to continue to export parts of the used electronic devices. The majority of e-stewards recyclers implement no-export policies regarding the entire device, yet are still allowed to export raw plastics and metals in their simplest form. Due to this loophole, electronics are often labeled as raw plastics in order to pass customs, but in reality contain most of the components of the full electronic device; this nearly complete device then follows the <b>general</b> <b>export</b> process of being shipped and broken down at an e-waste hub, where the non-valuable components are then shipped to a junkyard to be broken down. Additionally, reports show that recyclers with e-steward certification are able to export used electronics if the devices have undergone a test that proves they can still function. These devices similarly make up the shipments made to hubs for the extraction of valuable parts.|$|E
50|$|The Honda Z50M was {{the first}} Z50 Series of mini bikes {{produced}} by Honda. It was first made in late 1966 and released for sale in 1967 to the European, Australian and Canadian markets. The first thousand or so were all exported {{and then they were}} made available to the Japanese market, becoming one of Honda's first practical mini bikes. The Z50M was fully equipped with headlight, taillight, rear brake light, and horn and mirror and was able to be registered for road use in most countries. In Japan most were used on the road. In other countries many were used by children just for fun off-road and sustained damaged frames.
