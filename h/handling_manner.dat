50|$|The primary {{criticism}} of the FW15C was an inconsistent <b>handling</b> <b>manner</b> arising from occasions when the computer systems wrongly interpreted the information they were receiving from their sensors, or due to air being present in the hydraulics of the active system. Slight changes to the weight distribution of this latest Williams produced a car that was slightly more responsive than its immediate predecessor, if rather more nervous when driven on the limit. In particular this trait manifested itself in slight rear-end instability under braking, most notable on high speed circuits such as Hockenheim when the car was operating in a low downforce trim. It was a trait that particularly caused problems for the smoother driving style of Alain Prost who could set up the car best when it had even handling characteristics.|$|E

Under the hood, coil-on-plug ignition replaced the traditional spark plug wires; a first for the 4.6 L 2v Modular V8, this was a design borrowed from the 3.4 L V8 used in the 1996-1999 Ford Taurus SHO (and the 4.6 L 4v used in the 1993-1998 Lincoln Mark VIII & 1996-1998 Mustang SVT Cobra).|$|R

[...] He enlisted the neighboring tribes in aiding his campaign to capture as many Navajos as he could. One tribe that proved to be most useful were the Utes. The Utes were very knowledgeable of the lands of the Navajos, and were very familiar with Navajo strongholds as well. Carson would launch his full-scale assault on the Navajo population in January 1864. He would destroy everything in his path, eradicating the way of life of the Navajo people. Hogans were burned to the ground, livestock was killed off, and irrigated fields would be destroyed. Navajos who surrendered were taken to Fort Canby and those who resisted were killed. Navajos would be able to escape Carson's campaign but were soon forced to surrender due to starvation and the freezing temperature of the winter months.|$|R

40|$|From a distributional-theoretical framework, we make {{efforts in}} order {{to fill a gap}} in the series of studies which discuss the {{inheritance}} of the renormalization behaviour of a finite temperature field theory (FTFT) from the analogous version in quantum field theory (QFT) at T = 0. Renormalization is treated as a distributional extension problem having the mathematical structure disentangled as much as possible from the physical aspects. The purely technical details essential for the discussion are briefly reviewed in a <b>handle</b> <b>manner</b> for further theoretical physics applications. The analysis elucidates some qualitative and quantitative distinctions concerning the divergences in the perturbation series when it is considered the FTFT version associated to a given QFT. Despite the differences, it turns clear the reason why the leading ultraviolet behaviour keeps unaffected when it is considered the FTFT version associated to a given QFT. The study is model independent and the approach allows one to consider the FTFT both imaginary and real time formalism at once in a unified way in the contour ordered formalism.

The Philippines and other developing nations received this generation Pajero in 2003. The vehicle was completely redesigned, inside and out and had a lower, wider stance. A lower center of gravity meant the Pajero had better on-road <b>handling</b> <b>manners</b> and the newer body had over three hundred percent more torsional rigidity. The biggest change to bring this about was that the Pajero utilized a unibody construction, {{as opposed to the}} previous body-on-frame (box-ladder). This also permitted a longer suspension stroke. The fuel tank was also relocated to between the axles for better safety. The third generation Pajero moved one size up from mid-size to full-size SUV. On 17 May 2004 Mitsubishi announced that they were considering shutting down the Gifu plant but decided not to after negative feedback. The Gifu assembly plant is surrounded by Mitsubishi's other buildings in which manufacture electronics for Mitsubishi's other divisions. The Gifu plant is known as Pajero Manufacturing Co. and exclusively builds the full-size Pajero.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} the permission grid, a spatial occupancy grid used to guide almost any standard polygonal surface simplification algorithm into generating an approximation with a guaranteed geometric error bound. In particular, {{the distance between}} any point on the approximation and the original surface is bounded by a user-specified tolerance. Such bounds are notably absent from most current simplification methods, and are becoming increasingly important for applications such as collision detection and scientific computing. Conceptually simple, the permission grid defines a volume in which the approximation must lie, and does not permit the underlying simplification algorithm to generate approximations outside of this volume. The permission grid makes three important, practical improvements over current error-bounded simplification methods. First, it works on arbitrary triangular models, <b>handling</b> all <b>manners</b> of mesh degeneracies gracefully. Further, the error tolerance may be expanded as simplification proceeds, allowing the constructio...|$|R
