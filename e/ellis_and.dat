5|$|Team Canada {{assembled}} in Toronto and started training camp on August 13. Sinden named four co-captains: Phil Esposito, Frank Mahovlich, Stan Mikita and Jean Ratelle. The team trained {{for three weeks}} in Toronto, and arrived in Montreal on August 31 for the first game. The team held a practice on September 1 at the Forum.

5|$|As a manager, Virdon led the Pirates to the 1972 NL East {{division}} title, but the Pirates {{lost the}} 1972 National League Championship Series (NLCS) to the Cincinnati Reds when Pittsburgh pitcher Bob Moose unleashed a wild {{pitch in the}} final inning of Game 5, allowing the winning run to score. The 1973 Pirates had to play without Clemente, who died during the previous offseason. Further struggles included pitcher Steve Blass' inability to throw strikes and injuries to Dock Ellis. In 1973, Virdon clashed with <b>Ellis</b> <b>and</b> Richie Hebner, and the Pirates fell into third place, with a 67–69 record, and the team fired Virdon, replacing him with Murtaugh.|$|E

5|$|On 14 August 2006, it was {{confirmed}} that Randy Lerner, then {{owner of the}} National Football League's Cleveland Browns, had reached an agreement of £62.6million with Aston Villa for a takeover of the club.

5|$|Southcote {{forms an}} electoral {{ward of the}} Reading West constituency, and has three seats on Reading Borough Council. It {{is seen as a}} safe seat for the Labour Party; the Conservative Party last won a council seat in Southcote in 1987. The current three councillors are Debs Edwards, John <b>Ellis</b> <b>and</b> Matt Lawrence. The most recent {{election}} was held in 2016, which saw Edwards re-elected.

5|$|Beginning about 6:45, {{many members}} of the public began calling NBC network and {{affiliate}} switchboards. Some demanded the game be shown to its conclusion; others wanted to know if Heidi would start on time. These calls jammed the switchboards, and even blew repeated fuses in them, preventing the executives from getting through to each other to resolve the situation. NBC protocol required an operations order from Connal, to countermand the midweek written orders, but Cline received no call from the increasingly desperate Connal, who was frustrated by the switchboard issues. Without such an order, and not knowing of Goodman's approval, Cline made the decision that Heidi would start on time. The television audience saw Smith return Turner's kickoff out of the end zone to the Oakland 22-yard line with 1:01 remaining. Burbank BOC played the closing football theme and gave the word cue, to the outraged shock of <b>Ellis</b> <b>and</b> Connal, and the connection was irretrievably broken. Although the western United States continued to view the game, the eastern half of the nation instead saw a little girl on a Swiss mountain and was unaware that Oakland was in the course of scoring two touchdowns to win the game.|$|E
5|$|Noted songwriting duo Julia Houston (Debra Messing) and Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) get {{inspiration}} {{for a new}} Broadway show after Tom's personal assistant Ellis Tancharoen (Jaime Cepero) reveals his love for Marilyn Monroe. The two decide to cut a demo with Broadway veteran Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) which Ellis videotapes. He sends the tape to his mother who uploads it online. Julia and Tom grow angry towards this, fearing that theater critic Michael Riedel will write a harsh review of the song. They decide to fire Ellis, until they learn Riedel loved the song and approved {{of the idea of}} a Marilyn Monroe musical. They rehire <b>Ellis</b> <b>and</b> they quickly receive interest from producer Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston), who brings on director Derek Wills (Jack Davenport), who had a strained relationship with Tom. Derek demands to audition for the main role while Tom wants Ivy to play Marilyn. Meanwhile, a waitress named Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee), who came from a small town in Iowa to make her theatrical dreams a reality hears the original demo song and decides to audition. Karen makes a good impression on the producers, leading to both Karen and Ivy getting a callback. Later on, Derek calls Karen to have a meeting at his loft late at night.|$|E
