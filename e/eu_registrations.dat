40|$|It is {{relevant}} to consider uncertainty in individual predictions when quantitative structure-activity (or property) relationships (QSARs) are used to support decisions of high societal concern. Successful communication of uncertainty in the integration of QSARs in chemical safety assessment under the <b>EU</b> <b>Registration,</b> Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) system can be facilitated by a common {{understanding of how to}} define, characterise, assess and evaluate uncertainty in QSAR predictions. A QSAR prediction is, compared to experimental estimates, subject to added uncertainty that comes from the use of a model instead of empirically-based estimates. A framework is provided to aid the distinction between different types of uncertainty in a QSAR prediction: quantitative, i. e. for regressions related to the error in a prediction and characterised by a predictive distribution; and qualitative, by expressing our confidence in the model for predicting a particular compound based on a quantitative measure of predictive reliability. It is possible to assess a quantitative (i. e. probabilistic) predictive distribution, given the supervised learning algorithm, the underlying QSAR data, a probability model for uncertainty and a statistical principle for inference. The integration of QSARs into risk assessment may be facilitated by the inclusion of the assessment of predictive error and predictive reliability into the "unambiguous algorithm", as outlined in the second OECD principle...|$|R

40|$|In {{a global}} {{response}} to increasing {{health and environmental}} concerns, {{there has been a}} trend towards governments enacting legislation to encourage sustainable manufacturing where industry creates products that minimize environmental impact. This legislative trend seeks to shift the environmental responsibility of product manufacturing to the finished goods manufacturer. To meet this new responsibility, data relevant to the material composition of a product must flow unimpeded from the raw material producers to the final producers. Unfortunately, existing systems are ill-prepared to handle the new data requirements. For example, the European Unions (EU) Energy Using Product (EuP) Directive will require that companies provide total energy used during a products lifecycle, including manufacturing and transportation energy. To meet these new requirements, new systems must be designed and implemented, or modifications made to existing data management systems. Because every law poses its own unique requirements on industry, it is not always clear what information will need to be collected and stored.

40|$|Objectives In this study, the {{possibility}} of using existing test data provided in Korea and elsewhere for the registration of chemical substances was examined. Data on 510 chemical substances that are among the first subject to registration under the “Act on the Registration and Evaluation, etc. of Chemical Substances (K-REACH) ” were analyzed. Methods The possibility of using existing data from 16 reference databases was examined for 510 chemical substances notified in July 2015 as being subject to registration. Results Test data with the reliability required for the registration of chemical substances under the K-REACH constituted 48. 4 % of the required physicochemical characteristics, 6. 5 % of the required health hazards, and 9. 4 % of the required environmental hazards. Conclusions Some existing test data were not within the scope of this research, including data used for registration in the European Union (EU). Thus, considering that 350 of these 510 species are registered in <b>EU</b> <b>Registration,</b> Evaluation, Authorisation & Restriction of Chemicals, more test data may exist that can be utilized in addition to the data identified in this study. Furthermore, the K-REACH states that non-testing data (test results predicted through Read Across, Quantitative Structure- Activity Relationships) and the weight of evidence (test results predicted based on test data with low reliability) can also be utilized for registration data. Therefore, if methods for using such data were actively reviewed, {{it would be possible to}} reduce the cost of securing test data required for the registration of chemical substances...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} legislation of the <b>EU,</b> <b>Registration,</b> Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH), {{stipulates that}} about 30 [*] 000 chemical substances {{are to be}} assessed on their possible risks. Toxicological evaluation of these compounds will at least partly be based on animal testing. In particular, the assessment of reproductive toxicity is a very complicated, time-consuming and animal-demanding process. Introducing microarray-based technologies can potentially refine in vivo toxicity testing. If compounds of a distinct chemical class induce reproducible gene-expression responses with a recognizable overlap, these gene-expression signatures may indicate intrinsic features of certain compounds, including specific toxicity. In the present study, we have set out the first steps towards this approach for the reproductive toxicity of phthalates. Male rats were treated with a single dose of either reprotoxic or non-reprotoxic phthalates, and were analyzed 24 [*]h afterwards. Subsequently, histopathological and gene-expression profiling analyses were performed. Despite ambiguous histopathological observations, {{we were able to}} identify genes with differential expression profiles between the reprotoxic phthalates and the non-reprotoxic counterparts. This shows that differences in gene-expression profiles, indicative of the type of exposure, may be detected earlier, or at lower doses, than classical pathological endpoints. These findings are promising for ‘early warning’ biomarker analyses and for using toxicogenomics in a category approach. Ultimately, this could lead to a more cost-effective approach for prioritizing the toxicity testing of large numbers of chemicals {{in a short period of}} time in hazard assessment of chemicals, which is one of the objectives of the REACH chemical legislation...|$|R

40|$|Industrial {{chemicals}} {{are needed for}} chemical synthesis or technical purposes. These beneficial effects are coun-terbalanced by the potential health risks for all who {{come into contact with}} them. The new chemical legislation of the <b>EU,</b> <b>Registration,</b> Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) will force the responsibility of man-ufacturers and importers of chemical substances to gather the right information needed to decide on the right circumstances of use and control of chemical sub-stances and products. In order to understand the roots of REACH, experiences gained with regard to existing chemicals legislation, par-ticularly in Germany, will be reviewed. Since Council Directive 67 / 548 /EEC all chemicals placed on the market need a set of standard information and provisions for safe transportation. This directive and its amendments (Coun-cil Directive(s) 79 / 831 /EEC and 92 / 32 /EEC) have estab-lished for new substances a sound information data basis for classification of dangerous properties. Under Council Regulation 793 / 93 /EEC, regulations and adminis-trative provisions have established the requirement to assess the risk to man and the environment of existing substances. So far, only 119 substances have been evalu-ated under the forces of this regulation. This separation has led to a substantial imbalance between existing sub-stances and new substances with respect to available data needed to recognize hazards for health. The register of produced and imported chemical substances under REACH should eliminate some of this separation and will also be the key for selection of substances of very high concern by the authorization process to restrict the use and distribution accordingly.

40|$|Scenarios {{for future}} use in the {{pesticide}} registration procedure in Ethiopia were designed for 3 separate Ethiopian locations, which are aimed to be protective {{for the whole of}} Ethiopia. The scenarios estimate concentrations in surface water resulting from agricultural use of pesticides for a small stream and for two types of small ponds. Seven selected pesticides were selected since they were estimated to bear the highest risk to humans on the basis of volume of use, application rate and acute and chronic human toxicity, assuming exposure {{as a result of the}} consumption of surface water. Potential ecotoxicological risks were not considered as a selection criterion at this stage. Estimates of exposure concentrations in surface water were established using modelling software also applied in the <b>EU</b> <b>registration</b> procedure (PRZM and TOXSWA). Input variables included physico-chemical properties, and data such as crop calendars, irrigation schedules, meteorological information and detailed application data which were specifically tailored to the Ethiopian situation. The results indicate that for all the pesticides investigated the acute human risk resulting from the consumption of surface water is low to negligible, whereas agricultural use of chlorothalonil, deltamethrin, endosulfan and malathion in some crops may result in medium to high risk to aquatic species. The predicted environmental concentration estimates are based on procedures similar to procedures used at the EU level and in the USA. Addition of aquatic macrophytes as an ecotoxicological endpoint may constitute a welcome future addition to the risk assessment procedure. Implementation of the methods used for risk characterization constitutes a good step forward in the pesticide registration procedure in Ethiopia.

40|$|Harmonisation of the {{assessment}} of pesticide leaching to groundwater for <b>EU</b> <b>registration</b> is desirable to minimise confusion {{in the decision-making process}} at EU level. Recently, the FOCUS groundwater scenarios have been developed for three chromatographic models (PEARL, PELMO and PRZM) to increase this harmonisation. This study investigates the role of dispersion parameterisation in explaining the cause of the differences in pesticide leaching calculated by these models. PEARL describes dispersion via a physical parameter, ie the dispersion length. PELMO and PRZM simulate dispersion via a numerical procedure which generates an effective dispersion length equal to 0. 5 times the thickness of the numerical compartments. The hypothesis was tested that the difference in the dispersion length input parameter (ie 5 cm for PEARL and about 2. 5 cm for PELMO and PRZM) is a major cause of the difference in calculated leaching. It was tested whether results of PEARL calculations with a dispersion length of 2. 5 cm corresponded much better to results of PELMO or PRZM than results of PEARL calculations with a dispersion length of 5 cm. This was done by calculations for one substance and all nine FOCUS scenarios and by calculations for a range of substances and two FOCUS scenarios (Châteaudun and Sevilla). All calculations were for winter wheat and an application at 1 day before emergence. Both tests showed that reduction of the dispersion length from 5 to 2. 5 cm in PEARL led to a much better correspondence between PEARL and either PELMO or PRZM. Hence the hypothesis was supported. It is likely that harmonisation of the dispersion length in the FOCUS groundwater scenarios would reduce the differences in calculated leaching between PEARL and PELMO or PRZM considerably for part of these scenarios...|$|R
