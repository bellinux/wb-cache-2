40|$|Production of nanofibrous polyacrylonitrile/calcium {{carbonate}} (PAN/CaCO 3) nanocomposite web {{was carried}} out through solution electrospinning process. Pore generating nanoparticles were leached from the PAN matrices in <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bath</b> {{with the purpose of}} producing an ultimate nanoporous structure. The possible interaction between CaCO 3 nanoparticles and PAN functional groups was investigated. Atomic absorption method was used to measure the amount of extracted CaCO 3 nanoparticles. Morphological observation showed nanofibers of 270 – 720 nm in diameter containing nanopores of 50 – 130 nm. Monitoring the governing parameters statistically, {{it was found that the}} amount of extraction (ε) of CaCO 3 was increased when the web surface area (a) was broadened according to a simple scaling law (ε = 3. 18 a 0. 4). The leaching process was maximized in the presence of 5 % v/v of acid in the extraction bath and 5 wt % of CaCO 3 in the polymer solution. Collateral effects of the extraction time and temperature showed exponential growth within a favorable extremum at 50 °C for 72 h.

40|$|This work {{explores the}} use of {{polyimide}} substrates {{for the development of}} flexible graphene-based devices. Single layer graphene was synthesized by chemical vapour deposition and transferred to untreated and treated polyimide substrates. Of the four different surface treatments, the tetrafluoromethane/oxygen plasma and, especially, <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bath</b> treatments showed the best performance, as they reduced the resistivity of the graphene samples by as much as 46 %. At the same time, resistivity was also reduced by as much as 96 % due to the increase in the graphene coverage area as a result of repeating the transfer process up to four times. The combination of HCl treatment and transfer iteration led to the samples acquiring a sheet resistance of 800 Ω/sq. To the best of our knowledge, this is the lowest value ever reported in the literature for graphene samples on conventional flexible polymeric substrates and, in particular, in polyimide, the most widely used material for flexible applications. This result represents a major contribution to the development of graphene-based flexible devices. The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7 / 2007 - 2013) under grant agreement no. 600849 (INSIDDE Project).

40|$|A {{very severe}} {{drawback}} of metal construction parts made {{of iron and}} steel is their susceptibility to corrosion. There {{are a number of}} processes for attaining long-term material protection. In the case of hot-dip galvanisation the parts are coated with negatively electric metals, chiefly zinc. The surface of the metal being subjected to this process must be bright. To achieve this the parts are first pickled in a <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bath.</b> In the course of time the hydrochloric acid used for the pickling becomes spent as rust, hammer scales, iron and so on are deposited in the solution. This waste mixture has to be disposed of. In the techniques most commonly used up to now (oil-emulsion separation, CP units) the waste mixture is neutralized/precipitated and subsequently deposited on an special dump. The HYC-process recovers from the waste mixture valuable raw materials (iron chloride and zinc chloride) which can then be reintegrated in the processing cycle. A multiphase process removes the secondary constituents fouling the product or interfering with the separation process. The liquid is passed through an activated charcoal adsorption unit to remove the grease, inhibitors etc. from it. In a two-phase carburizing process heavy metals introduced through the steel being galvanized and the zinc used for this purpose are precipitated. The core of the unit consists of a zinc specific liquid-liquid extraction in which the iron chloride and zinc chloride are separated from one another. After passing through several re-treatment phases in an evaporation unit both the FeCl_ 2 and the ZnCl_ 2 solutions have reached the concentration desired. (orig.)

40|$|The {{objective}} of this U. S. Air Force research program was to demonstrate that selective ion exchange (SIE) resins can economically remove contaminant metals from full-sized plating baths. Two SIE pilot plants were built, one at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, and the other at McClellan AFB, California. The pilot plants were tested for removal of contaminant metals from electroless nickel, nickel strike, and <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> etch <b>baths.</b> Testing of the SIE pilot plant {{was carried out in}} two steps, bath treatment and resin regeneration.

Results o f the SIE tests include bath treatment economics and data for plant design. Use of SIE reduces the waste generated from electroplating operations. The cost savings from the SIE treatment are a result o f lower waste treatment and bath replacement costs. ELECTROPLATING SOLUTION RECLAMATIO...|$|R

The proposed algorithm is tested for control of a steel pickling process in several cases in simulation such as for set point tracking, disturbance, model mismatch and presence of noise.
