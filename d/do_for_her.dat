25|$|The {{plan was}} ready for review and {{presentation}} to Congressional leaders when Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963. A few days after President Kennedy's funeral, President Lyndon B. Johnson met with Jacqueline Kennedy in the Oval Office and asked what he could <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> Mrs. Kennedy requested two things: That Cape Canaveral be renamed for her husband, and that the Pennsylvania Avenue redevelopment plan move forward. Word of the request leaked to the public, and Johnson publicly supported the area's redevelopment on October 24, 1964. Johnson subsequently approved {{the establishment of a}} Temporary President's Commission on Pennsylvania Avenue (composed of Cabinet members, federal planners, architects, and others) to move the plan forward, although it did not hold its first meeting until May 21, 1965. The Temporary Commission's goal was to push for a permanent body with the legal authority to engage in condemnation and force public and private bodies to conform to its plans. Before the Temporary Commission was named, District of Columbia officials agreed to abandon plans to build an office building west of the District Building, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agreed to reorient its planned headquarters more squarely with Pennsylvania Avenue.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Burning Up" [...] has a starker {{arrangement}} {{brought about}} by bass, single guitar and drum machine. The guitar riffs in the songs were not characteristics of Madonna's later records. The tom-tom drum beats used in the song were reminiscent of the records of singer Phil Collins. It also incorporated electric guitars and the most state-of-the-art synthesizers of that time. The chorus is a repetition of the same three lines of the lyrics, while the bridge consists {{of a series of}} double entendres in regards to the lyrics of the song which describes what she is prepared to <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> lover and that she is individualistic and shameless.|$|E

Truman assumed President Roosevelt wanted to meet with him, but Eleanor Roosevelt informed him her husband had died after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Truman's first concern was for Mrs. Roosevelt. He asked if there was anything he could <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> to which she replied, [...] "Is there anything we can do for you?

She also sings the lines [...] "Let me feed you, let me run your bath water, {{whatever}} you desire" [...] after the thins she had previously listed. Rowland was noted for nearly rapping her solo part during which she promises to [...] "keep my figure right," [...] "keep my hair fixed" [...] and acknowledges that if her man comes later home while she's asleep, [...] "all he's gotta do is tap her {{on the shoulder and}} 'I'll roll over.'"

500|$|In {{the music}} video, Bieber is {{attracted}} {{to a girl}} (Grace Marie Wilson) he sees every day washing clothes at the local laundromat. In the opening scenes, Bieber is wearing a green hooded sweatshirt, similar to the gray one he wore in the [...] "One Time" [...] video, along with a cranberry shirt. One day while he is waiting for his clothes and is tuning his guitar, she drops a scarf, and he picks it up. In the laundromat scene Bieber is wearing a mixed purple, blue & orange plaid collared shirt, with a dark purple tee. The girl comes {{back the next day}} however he is not there. He then posts a sign beside the washer that he found her missing scarf. He leads the girl on a scavenger hunt for the scarf, posting signs with pictures of him on them around the town to encourage her to go on a date with him. He takes pictures of him in situations such as buying chocolate for her and the puppies scene, and others, with notes doting quips of what he would <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> During the date and ending scenes Bieber has on a white striped collared shirt, with a dark cyan tee.

500|$|Both Ruby and Brax decide Charlie's {{ventilator}} {{should be}} turned off as {{there is nothing more}} the doctors can <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and Charlie dies. Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} years and you really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them – it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But once I had time to let it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's very dramatic and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!" [...] Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012.|$|E

500|$|... "Borderline" [...] is {{a sentimental}} track, {{talking about a}} love that is never quite fulfilled. According to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández and his book Madonna's drowned worlds, the lyrics of the song like [...] "Something {{in the way you}} love me won't let me be/I don't want to be your {{prisoner}} so baby won't you set me free" [...] depicted a rebellion against male chauvinism. Madonna used a refined and expressive voice to sing the song, backed by Lucas's instrumentation. It opens with a keyboard rich intro and a catchy synth melody provided by Fred Zarr. Bass player Anthony Jackson doubled Dean Gant's synth bass to provide a solid and more complex texture. The chords in the song were inspired by Seventies disco sound in Philadelphia as well as Elton John's musical style during the mid-seventies. The chord sequences cite from Bachman–Turner Overdrive's song [...] "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet" [...] while the synth phases display her typical musical style. The third track [...] "Burning Up" [...] has a starker arrangement, brought about by bass, single guitar and Linn drum machine. The drum beats used in the song were reminiscent to the records of singer Phil Collins. It also incorporated electric guitars and the most state-of-the-art synthesizers of that time. The chorus is a repetition of the same three lines, while the bridge consists of a series of double entendres; the lyrics describing what Madonna is prepared to <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> lover, and that she is individualistic and shameless.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{concludes with}} the love songs, [...] "Comfort You", [...] "Come Here My Love", and [...] "Country Fair"—the latter two {{employing}} the traditional Irish ballad style. [...] To Clinton Heylin, the songs also spoke to [...] "the {{healing power of}} love... here at last are songs that speak of what he can <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> rather than concerned solely with his needs and wants." [...] Heylin comments on the song, [...] "Come Here My Love": [...] "This is no 'Autumn Song'. Rather, it {{sounds a lot like}} a man learning how to love again." [...] Morrison spoke of [...] "Country Fair" [...] as having the same kind of feeling as [...] "And It Stoned Me", although that song was used to open the Moondance album, instead of as a kind of closure.|$|E
2500|$|Maria Pearson {{is often}} {{credited}} {{with being the}} earliest catalyst for the passage of NAGPRA legislation; she has been called [...] "the Founding Mother of modern Indian repatriation movement" [...] and the [...] "Rosa Parks of NAGPRA". In the early 1970s, Pearson was appalled that the skeletal remains of Native Americans were treated differently from white remains. Her husband, an engineer with the Iowa Department of Transportation, told her that both Native American and white remains were uncovered during road construction in Glenwood, Iowa. While the remains of 26 white burials were quickly reburied, {{the remains of a}} Native American mother and child were sent to a lab for study instead. Pearson protested to Governor Robert D. Ray, finally gaining an audience with him after sitting outside his office in traditional attire. [...] "You can give me back my people's bones and you can quit digging them up", she responded when the governor asked what he could <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> The ensuing controversy led to the passage of the Iowa Burials Protection Act of 1976, the first legislative act in the United States that specifically protected Native American remains.|$|E

2500|$|Most critics {{agreed that}} the main {{highlight}} of the film was the leading pair and Shahid and Kareena's chemistry. Rajeev Masand further explained, [...] "The real magic of this film lies in the performances of its two main leads who seize your attention {{from the moment they}} first appear on screen." [...] Taran Adarsh commented, [...] "Shahid delivers his career-best performance in Jab We Met... Kareena is in top form as well. Jab We Met is a turning point in her career [...] Fantabulous -- that's the right word to describe her work this time. The confidence with which she handles the contrasting characterization speaks volumes. This film should <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> what Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) did for Kajol." [...] Subhash K. Jha approved the chemistry as well, [...] "...there are sparks...and the ones between Kareena and Shahid are so unselfconsciously genuine that you end up looking at the characters rather than the two actors going through a series of brilliantly conceived and energized incidents..." [...] The Times of India gave the film 4 out of 5 stars concluding, [...] "The film belongs to Shahid and Kareena who pitch in memorable performances and lend a whole new meaning to the boy-meets-girl story." [...] Joginder Tuteja from indiaglitz.com gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, described it as [...] "Shahid-Kareena's DDLJ", and concluded that [...] "...it would be a pain if any of the two actors do not get awarded and rewarded for their performances..." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Kebra Nagast of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Pharaoh's {{daughter}} tricked Solomon into committing idolatry {{by making}} him swear an oath. In the text {{she was upset}} that he has slept with the Queen of Sheba and fathered Menyelek (who is held to have taken the Arc of the Covenant with him when the Queen returned with him to Africa). Solomon at first resists her calls saying [...] "I will neither sacrifice to nor worship thine idols, and I will not perform thy wish." [...] So [...] "one day she beautified and scented herself for him, and she behaved herself haughtily towards him, and treated him disdainfully. And he said unto her, [...] "What shall I do? Thou hast made thy face evil towards me, and thy regard towards me is not as it was formerly, and thy beautiful form is not as enticing as usual. Ask me, and I will give thee whatsoever thou wishest, and I will perform it for thee, so that thou mayest make thy face (or, attitude) gracious towards me as formerly"; but she held her peace and answered him never a word. And he repeated to her the words {{that he would do}} whatsoever she wished, and she said unto him, [...] "Swear to me by the God of Israel that thou wilt not play me false." [...] And he swore to her that he would give her whatsoever she asked for, and that he would <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> everything that she told him. And she tied a scarlet thread on the middle of the door of [...] her gods, and she brought three locusts and set them in the house of her gods. And she said unto Solomon, [...] "Come to me without breaking the scarlet thread, bend thyself and kill these locusts before me and pull out their necks"; and he did so. And she said unto him, [...] "I will henceforward do thy will, for thou hast sacrificed to my gods and hast worshipped them." [...] Now he had done thus because of his oath, so that he might not break his oath which she had made him to swear, even though he knew that it was an offence (or, sin) to enter into the house of her gods." ...|$|E
