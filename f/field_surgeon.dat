5|$|Trevor Kincaid {{was born}} in Peterborough, Ontario, in 1872. He {{was the son of}} Robert Kincaid, a first {{generation}} Canadian whose own father had immigrated from Ireland in the early 19th century. Robert Kincaid received his medical degree from Queen's University and undertook his internship at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. In 1861, Kincaid found himself caught up in the war hysteria that followed the capitulation of Fort Sumter and volunteered to join the United States Army, serving during the American Civil War first as a <b>field</b> <b>surgeon</b> and, later, {{as a member of the}} medical staff at Armory Square Hospital in Washington, DC. After the war he returned to Peterborough and took up private medical practice, eventually marrying Mary Bell, who gave birth to Trevor.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the American Civil War, she volunteered for the Union Army as a civilian. The U.S. Army had no female surgeons, and at first she was allowed to practice only as a nurse. During this period, she served at the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas), July 21, 1861, and at the Patent Office Hospital in Washington, D.C. She worked as an unpaid <b>field</b> <b>surgeon</b> near the Union front lines, including at the Battle of Fredericksburg and in Chattanooga after the Battle of Chickamauga. As a suffragist, she was happy to see women serving as soldiers, and alerted the press to the case of Frances Hook, in Ward 2 of the Chattanooga hospital, a woman who served in the Union forces disguised as a man. Walker was the first female surgeon of the Union army. She wore men's clothing during her work, claiming it to be easier for high demands of her work.|$|E
2500|$|What {{happened}} during the Battle of The Waxhaws, known to the Americans as the Buford Massacre or as the Waxhaw massacre, {{is the subject of}} debate. According to an American <b>field</b> <b>surgeon</b> named Robert Brownfield who witnessed the events, the Continental Army Col. Buford raised a white flag of surrender, [...] "expecting the usual treatment sanctioned by civilized warfare". While Buford was calling for quarter, Tarleton's horse was struck by a musket ball and fell. This gave the Loyalist cavalrymen the impression that the Continentals had shot at their commander while asking for mercy. Enraged, the Loyalist troops charged at the Virginians. According to Brownfield, the Loyalists attacked, carrying out [...] "indiscriminate carnage never surpassed by the most ruthless atrocities of the most barbarous savages".|$|E

50|$|Kane was {{a railway}} surgeon for five {{different}} railroads. In Kane's time, railway surgery was markedly different from surgery {{in a hospital}} and {{was considered to be}} its own <b>field.</b> <b>Surgeons</b> frequently needed to operate at great distances from a proper hospital facility, often in dirty and unsanitary conditions, and operations were performed with only basic equipment and materials. Industrial accidents on the railways resulted in many crushing injuries. A large proportion of the estimated 1,000 operations Kane performed in the three years from 1898 to 1900 were treatment for accidents on the railways, many of which were laparotomies. Several of Kane's medical innovations were intended to be aids to the <b>surgeon</b> in the <b>field,</b> and clearly inspired by his work as a railway surgeon.|$|R

50|$|Hickman, disillusioned by {{the lack}} of {{response}} and wounded by an 1826 article in The Lancet titled 'Surgical Humbug' that ruthlessly criticised his work, turned to King Charles X of France in April 1828.

2500|$|It was on {{that day}} that she {{identified}} herself with army work and began her efforts towards collecting medical supplies for the Union soldiers. Prior to distributing provisions directly onto the battlefield and gaining further support, Barton used her own living quarters as a storeroom and distributed supplies {{with the help of}} a few friends in early 1862, despite opposition in the War Department and among <b>field</b> <b>surgeons.</b> [...] Ladies' Aid societies helped in sending bandages, food, and clothing that would later be distributed during the Civil War. [...] In August 1862, Barton finally gained permission from Quartermaster Daniel Rucker to work on the front lines. [...] She gained support from other people who believed in her cause. [...] These people became her patrons, her most supportive being Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{third group}} (usually {{referred}} to as [...] "organleggers" [...] proper) {{were the ones who}} found potential customers, and delivered the organs to them. They were salespeople and <b>field</b> <b>surgeons</b> at the same time. The advent of automated precision surgical equipment allowed them to transplant the organs on the spot and required minimal training to operate. This was by far the most dangerous aspect of the operation. Some customers would attempt to turn in the organleggers in a fit of conscience after receiving their transplant. At least one pair of organleggers were killed by a customer attempting to cover his tracks for another crime. For this reason, they changed their identities, faces, and other physical characteristics frequently—a simple process given that they can use their own stockpiles for cosmetic grafts.|$|R
5000|$|Jones was {{appointed}} a surgeon at the Country Orthopedic Hospital at Gobowen {{and took up}} an honorary position at North Wales Sanatorium. He began publishing articles in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery in the early 1930s and produced {{an average of three}} a year from then on. His contributions earned him recognition and he began teaching a popular course on fractions at Liverpool University in 1936, which prompted him to work on a textbook; Fractures and Joint Injuries, which appeared in 1940, was reprinted and translated many times and called a [...] "masterpiece". Its clear and accessible language meant that it became a valued guidebook to <b>field</b> <b>surgeons</b> in World War II. In 1937 Watson changed his surname to 'Watson-Jones' but kept 'Watson' as a separate middle name to distinguish himself from many of the other people called Jones in Liverpool.|$|R
50|$|Krukenberg studied {{medicine}} at the Universities of Bonn, Strassburg and Heidelberg. Afterwards he was a surgical assistant to Friedrich Trendelenburg (1844-1924) in Bonn, and to Max Schede (1844-1902) at Eppendorf Hospital in Hamburg. In 1892 he became manager of a private clinic in Halle an der Saale, and in 1899 was chief surgeon at the municipal hospital in Liegnitz.

He visited the battlefields and field hospitals of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, {{as a representative of}} the Russian Red Cross, and was again a <b>field</b> <b>surgeon</b> in the Russo-Turkish War in 1877.|$|E

40|$|The global {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to review from the "Fellow" perspective, the current status of pediatric minimal access surgery (MAS) in terms of teaching feasibility, safety and impact on standard practice paradigms. In the pediatric general surgery <b>field,</b> <b>surgeons</b> are dealing with a wide range of pathology that includes thoracic, abdominal, urological and gynecological procedures. The learning curve is slow because of a relatively small volume of patients. However, gradually but steadily, a significant proportion of the procedures traditionally performed, with major open exposures at present, are preferentially performed by minimal access. Currently, minimal access surgery training is incorporated into adult general surgery residency/fellowship programs and teaching techniques of pediatric MAS are available only as seldom international workshops. Pediatric surgery fellowship programs with incorporated guidelines for MAS training are just recently feasible in select centers, mostly as "self" established programs. In many other pediatric surgery centers, teaching the "glamour" of MAS is quite dependent on a program director&#x 2032;s vision. Integration of MAS training into the secondary residency/fellowship curriculum of pediatric surgeons is the inevitable goal. MAS- minded education and research through adequate training will pay dividends and "manufacture" competent, contemporary trainees. National Pediatric Surgery Associations should be responsible for setting criteria that consider the MAS for accreditation with maintaining the international standards of these teaching programs...|$|R
