2500|$|Aside {{from the}} issues of {{legality}} in some countries and states and of sometime opposition the effectiveness of speed cameras is very well documented. The introduction to [...] by Richard Allsop includes the following in the foreword by Professor Stephen Glaister, Director of the RAC (Royal Automobile Club). [...] "While this report fully lays out the background {{to the introduction of}} speed cameras and the need for speed limits, its job is not to justify why the national limits are what they are; a review of speed limits to see whether they are soundly based is for another day. What it <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> to show that at camera sites, speeds have been reduced, and that as a result, collisions resulting in injuries have fallen. The government has said that a decision on whether speed cameras should be funded must be taken at a local level. With the current pressure on public funds, there will be – indeed there already are – those who say that what little money there is can be better spent. This report begs to differ. The devices are already there; they demonstrate value for money, yet are not significant revenue raisers for the Treasury; they are shown to save lives; and despite the headlines, most people accept the need for them. Speed cameras should never be the only weapon in the road safety armoury, but neither should they be absent from the battle." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1988, Cox's {{campaign}} {{sent out}} a four-page political mailer to 110,000 potential Republican voters in the district, which accused Rosenberg of concealing links to Erhard and his companies and of not being fully truthful regarding his work experience. The mailer characterized Rosenberg as an [...] "est advocate". It quoted a Los Angeles magazine article which had said that the Chicago, Illinois organization Cult Awareness Network referred to Erhard's companies as [...] "destructive cults". Quotations included in the mailer said [...] "what Erhard <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> utterly disastrous". The Los Angeles magazine article cited by the mailer quotes {{a representative of the}} Cult Awareness Network who had compared the est organization to the Unification Church, Scientology, Transcendental Meditation, and Hare Krishna. The Orange County Register compared the mailer to a similar brochure sent out by Badham's 1986 campaign to voters in the district. A political consultant for Cox said that the mailer was sent out in order to point out [...] "Rosenberg's campaign tactics of concealment and distortion," [...] and stated [...] "We just wanted to tell the voter to be wary of anything Nathan Rosenberg says." [...] The Cox campaign also placed phone calls to voters asking for their opinions on a political candidate's links [...] "with that cult est". A subsequent mailer sent out by the Cox campaign included an article that detailed Rosenberg's connections to Erhard's est organization. The article stated [...] "some critical studies ... branded" [...] est [...] "a non- or even anti-religious cult with Eastern mystical overtones".|$|E

2500|$|As The Shooting {{was never}} {{released}} theatrically, and had sparse television showings, it initially {{had a very}} limited core of fans. Those critics who did manage to view the film were extremely enthusiastic, and generally found it superior to Hellman's companion western, Ride in the Whirlwind. Danny Peary in Cult Movies (1981), after admitting that he had difficulties with the [...] "puzzling" [...] climax, noted [...] "But while the end may ask more questions than it answers, the exciting journey {{that brings us to}} this point {{is one of the most}} rewarding sequences in the history of westerns." [...] Leonard Maltin said it was an [...] "...ultimately powerful film with an offbeat performance by Nicholson as a hired gun... and an incredible, unexpected finale." [...] David Pirie in Time Out wrote, [...] "Probably the first Western which really deserves to be called existential... Hellman builds remorselessly on the atmosphere and implications of the 'quest' until it assumes a terrifying importance in itself... What Hellman <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> to take the basic tools of the Western, and use them, without in anyway diluting or destroying their power, as the basis for a Kafkaesque drama." [...] Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: The Western notes that [...] "Hellman's calculated style, replete with disorientating close-ups and strange moments... confirm the detached fatalism of his story. This is a marvelous film." [...] James Monaco's The Movie Guide described the film as [...] "ighly effective, playing with various levels of character and ideas... it is a fine western stylization that should not be missed." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum has referred to the film as the first acid western, and cited it as an inspiration for Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man. The Shooting has a 100% favorable rating on the [...] "Critical Tomatometer" [...] at the Rotten Tomatoes website.|$|E
