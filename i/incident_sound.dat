25|$|A carbon {{microphone}}, {{also known}} as a carbon button microphone (or sometimes just a button microphone), uses a capsule or button containing carbon granules pressed between two metal plates like the Berliner and Edison microphones. A voltage is applied across the metal plates, causing a small current to flow through the carbon. One of the plates, the diaphragm, vibrates in sympathy with <b>incident</b> <b>sound</b> waves, applying a varying pressure to the carbon. The changing pressure deforms the granules, causing the contact area between each pair of adjacent granules to change, and this causes the electrical resistance of the mass of granules to change. The changes in resistance cause a corresponding change in the current flowing through the microphone, producing the electrical signal. Carbon microphones were once commonly used in telephones; they have extremely low-quality sound reproduction and a very limited frequency response range, but are very robust devices. The Boudet microphone, which used relatively large carbon balls, was similar to the granule carbon button microphones.|$|E
25|$|Condenser {{microphones}} {{span the}} range from telephone transmitters through inexpensive karaoke microphones to high-fidelity recording microphones. They generally produce a high-quality audio signal {{and are now}} the popular choice in laboratory and recording studio applications. The inherent suitability of this technology {{is due to the}} very small mass that must be moved by the <b>incident</b> <b>sound</b> wave, unlike other microphone types that require the sound wave to do more work. They require a power source, provided either via microphone inputs on equipment as phantom power or from a small battery. Power is necessary for establishing the capacitor plate voltage, and is also needed to power the microphone electronics (impedance conversion in the case of electret and DC-polarized microphones, demodulation or detection in the case of RF/HF microphones). Condenser microphones are also available with two diaphragms that can be electrically connected to provide a range of polar patterns (see below), such as cardioid, omnidirectional, and figure-eight. It is also possible to vary the pattern continuously with some microphones, for example the Røde NT2000 or CAD M179.|$|E

The vorticity of the superfluid component and the sound interact because of the nonlinear character of these equations. Explicit expressions for the scattered pressure and temperature are worked out in a first Born approximation, and care is exercised in delimiting the range of validity of the assumptions needed for this approximation to hold. An <b>incident</b> second <b>sound</b> wave will partly convert into first <b>sound,</b> and an <b>incident</b> first <b>sound</b> wave will partly convert into second sound.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new type}} of test device, which is the 45 -degree <b>incident</b> angle <b>sound</b> absorption coefficient (SAC) test device. A V-shaped acoustic wave-guide with the two branches forming a 45 degree angle from the horizontal direction was designed to measure the sound absorption coefficient of installed trim materials. The device was also designed for the subjective evaluation and objective psychoacoustic metric target setting of a sound source. The 45 -degree <b>incident</b> angle <b>sound</b> absorption coefficient test device can also be applied to the design of the vehicle interior trim materials or sound package to minimize the negative effect of interior noise. The measurement principle of the 45 -degree incident angle SAC device will be introduced first, and the experiment procedure will be then illustrated. Different kinds of trim materials were tested. The measured sound pressure data was processed {{with the help of the}} MATLAB program codes, and then the sound absorption coefficient curves were calculated and plotted. The results show the 45 -degree <b>incident</b> angle <b>sound</b> absorption coefficient measurement device is a useful tool for the measurement of the trim materials for their sound absorption coefficient and for analysis of their effect on the psychoacoustic performance of a sound source. Meanwhile, a psychoacoustic analysis of sound pressure data of a sound source using ArtemiS software allows for the design of a preferred sound in the device using trim materials. These have been tested by the 45 -degree incident angle SAC device...|$|R

50|$|Traditionally sound {{pressure}} is measured using microphones. Microphones have a polar pattern describing their sensitivity {{as a function}} of the direction of the <b>incident</b> <b>sound.</b> Many microphones have an omnidirectional polar pattern which means their sensitivity is independent of the direction of the <b>incident</b> <b>sound.</b> Microphones with other polar patterns exist that are more sensitive in a certain direction. This however is still no solution for the sound localization problem as one tries to determine either an exact direction, or a point of origin. Besides considering microphones that measure {{sound pressure}}, it is also possible to use a particle velocity probe to measure the acoustic particle velocity directly. The particle velocity is another quantity related to acoustic waves however, unlike sound pressure, particle velocity is a vector. By measuring particle velocity one obtains a source direction directly. Other more complicated methods using multiple sensors are also possible. Many of these methods use the time difference of arrival (TDOA) technique.|$|E

50|$|A {{reverberation}} chamber or {{room is a}} room {{designed to}} create a diffuse or random incidence sound field (i.e. one with a uniform distribution of acoustic energy and random direction of sound incidence over a short time period). Reverberation chambers tend to be large rooms (the resulting sound field becomes more diffused with increased path length) and have very hard exposed surfaces. The change of impedance (compared to the air) these surfaces present to <b>incident</b> <b>sound</b> is so large that {{virtually all of the}} acoustic energy that hits a surface is reflected back into the room. Arranging the room surfaces (including the ceiling) to be non-parallel helps inhibit the formation of standing waves - additional acoustic diffusers are often used to create more reflecting surfaces and further encourage even distribution of any particular sound field.|$|E

50|$|To {{explain how}} the {{proximity}} effect arises in directional microphones, {{it is first necessary}} to briefly describe how a directional microphone works. A microphone is constructed with a diaphragm whose mechanical movement is converted to electrical signals (via a magnetic coil, for example). The movement of the diaphragm {{is a function of the}} air pressure difference across the diaphragm arising from <b>incident</b> <b>sound</b> waves. In a directional microphone, sound reflected from surfaces behind the diaphragm is permitted to impinge on the rear side of the diaphragm. Since the sound reaching the rear of the diaphragm travels slightly farther than the sound at the front, it is slightly out of phase. The greater this phase difference, the greater the pressure difference and the greater the diaphragm movement. As the sound source moves off the diaphragm axis, this phase difference decreases due to decreasing path length difference. This is what gives a directional microphone its directivity.|$|E

This project aims to de-place the {{obsolete}} by literal {{deconstruction of}} cultural constraint; not to supplant with new confined preparedness but re-place with open potential. Liberated of mechanical interface {{and clean the}} defunct piano is in effect recycled into a new space/object, a “sound cabinet” reclaiming analogue instrumental memory and function. I stress this is only towards pianos deemed defunct and not an attitude to be taken towards pianos in general! The event of "liberating" (moving, removal of obstructive parts and cleaning) the piano creates <b>incident</b> <b>sounds</b> that are raw outcomes of the process. Documenting these sounds and either/or sampling and feeding them back is interesting with regard to memory and the conference theme.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of cylindrical sound waves with a stationary shock is investigated by a method analogous {{to that used}} by H.

The <b>incident</b> cylindrical <b>sound</b> wave is represented as a superposition of plane sound waves of varying direction. Each of the plane waves in this superposition interacts with the shock giving rise to a previously determined distortion of the shock front and reflected or refracted wave field; the cylindrical wave causes a disturbance which may be written in integral form as a superposition of these plane waves. The resulting interaction integrals are evaluated asymptotically to give explicit formulas for the distortion of the shock, the sound field, and the entropy‐vorticity wave...|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} by which anechoic chambers minimize the reflection of sound waves impinging onto their walls is as follows: In the included figure, an <b>incident</b> <b>sound</b> wave I is about to impinge onto a wall of an anechoic chamber. This wall is composed {{of a series of}} wedges W with height H. After the impingement, the incident wave I is reflected as a series of waves R which in turn [...] "bounce up-and-down" [...] in the gap of air A (bounded by dotted lines) between the wedges W. Such bouncing may produce (at least temporarily) a standing wave pattern in A. During this process, the acoustic energy of the waves R gets dissipated via the air's molecular viscosity, in particular near the corner C. [...] In addition, with the use of foam materials to fabricate the wedges, another dissipation mechanism happens during the wave/wall interactions. As a result, the component of the reflected waves R along the direction of I that escapes the gaps A (and goes back to the source of sound), denoted R', is notably reduced. Even though this explanation is two-dimensional, it is representative and applicable to the actual three-dimensional wedge structures used in anechoic chambers.|$|E

40|$|A semi-empirical fluid {{mechanical}} {{model of the}} acoustic behavior of Helmholtz resonators is presented which predicts impedance {{as a function of}} the amplitude and frequency of the <b>incident</b> <b>sound</b> pressure field and resonator geometry.

At high values, resistance is predicted to be independent of frequency, proportional to the square root of the amplitude of the <b>incident</b> <b>sound</b> pressure field, and virtually independent of resonator geometry.

50|$|Dion and Sara are {{attracted}} to each other, and Dion begins {{to spend time with}} her at the store, often hiding and joining her after closing time. Sara seems to live in the store, dressing up in whatever clothing she likes from the racks, and always being able to avoid the guards. With Sara, Dion is able to live out his own fantasies about owning or living in Alcott-Simpson's. Sara says that she watches over a group of her younger siblings, called the Others, who also stay at the store, playing in different departments. Dion is unable to see the Others, but hears from a store clerk about animals being let out of the store pet shop (one of which frightened a customer and caused the screaming <b>incident),</b> <b>sounds</b> of running feet and laughter, and toys moving by themselves. Although Sara is vague about how she and the Others are permitted in the store, Dion eventually figures out that Sara and the Others are ghost children killed by a famine, whom Madame Stregovitch has brought to live in the store using her supernatural powers. The Others' antics are now scaring away the store's customers. Madame asks Dion not to visit the store until she finishes addressing the situation, but Dion, missing Sara, goes to visit her one more time and asks her to stay with him. Sara says she cannot leave the Others and encourages Dion to join her instead, by jumping off the roof of the store (presumably dying from the fall and becoming a ghost). However, at the last second Dion hesitates and Sara stops him from falling. Realizing that they occupy different worlds, Sara and Dion sadly part. Madame later uses her supernatural powers to send the ghosts back from whence they came, but it is too late to save Alcott-Simpson's, which soon closes down. Dion feels bereft, but continues his life.|$|R
