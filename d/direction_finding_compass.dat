40|$|Behavior and {{electrophysiological}} {{studies have}} demonstrated a sensitivity to characteristics of the Geomagnetic field {{that can be used}} for navigation, both for <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> (<b>compass)</b> and position finding (map). The avian magnetic compass receptor appears to be a light-dependent, wavelength-sensitive system that functions as a polarity compass (i. e., it distinguishes poleward from equatorward rather than north from south) and is relatively insensitive to changes in magnetic field intensity. The receptor is within the retina and is based on one or more photopigments, perhaps cryptochromes. A second receptor system appears to be based on magnetite and might serve to transduce location information independent of the compass system. This receptor is associated with the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve and is sensitive to very small (3 ̆c 50 nanotesla) changes in the intensity of the magnetic field. In neither case has a neuron that responded to changes in the magnetic field been traced to a structure that can be identified to be a receptor. Almost nothing is known about how magnetic information is processed within the brain or how it is combined with other sensory information and used for navigation. These remain areas of future research...|$|E
30|$|<b>Direction</b> <b>finding</b> is a {{major issue}} of {{interest}} in array signal processing for MIMO radar. In this context, this issue has drawn attention from researchers in recent years. The quaternion theory was applied in <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> for bistatic MIMO radar by means of singular value decomposition and root multiple signal classification (Root-MUSIC) in [6]. An ESPRIT-based algorithm was presented via the banded symmetric and Toeplitz matrices for <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> of bistatic MIMO radar in [7]. The unitary dual-resolution ESPRIT algorithm was proposed for <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> of bistatic MIMO radar without extra pairing in [8]. Moreover, the maximum likelihood <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> method for bistatic MIMO radar was proposed in [9].|$|R

This dissertation discusses {{an investigation}} into methods for detection and <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> of direct-sequence spread-spectrum signals (DSSS), appropriate for a particular DSP-based <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> platform. Relevant details on DSSS and radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> are presented.

The results of experiments run on simulated data indicate that this approach has merit for the automated detection and <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> of DSSS signals. the least-squares algorithm applied to a single capture of power-spectrum data is shown to perform comparably with human experts...|$|R
40|$|A radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> (DF) {{system is}} an antenna array and a {{receiver}} {{arranged in a}} combination to determine the azimuth angle of a distant emitter. Basically, all DF systems derive the emitter location from an initial determination of the angle-of-arrival (AOA). Radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> techniques have classically been based on multiple-antenna systems employing multiple receivers. Classic techniques such as MUSIC [1][2] and ESPRIT use simultaneous phase information from each antenna to estimate the angle-of-arrival of the signal of interest. In many scenarios (e. g., hand-held systems), however, multiple receivers are impractical. Thus, single channel techniques are of interest, particularly in mobile scenarios. Although the amount of existing research for single channel DF is considerably less than for multi-channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding,</b> single channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> techniques have been previously investigated. Since many of the single channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> techniques are older analog techniques and have been analyzed in previous work, we will investigate a new single channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> technique that takes specific advantage of digital capabilities. Specifically, we propose...|$|R
