5|$|In the 1920s, Howe {{introduced}} her to representatives of women's political organizations, with which she became active, and watched and critiqued her speeches to these groups. The pair even developed a system of <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> that Howe would use while she spoke to warn {{her if she was}} lapsing into a bad habit. He encouraged her to express herself in print as well, and acted for a time as her literary agent.|$|E
5|$|During {{his nine}} years at Massillon, Brown invented the playbook, a {{detailed}} listing of formations and set plays, and tested his players on {{their knowledge of}} it. He also originated the practice of sending in plays to his quarterback from the sideline using <b>hand</b> <b>signals.</b> His overall record at the school was 80–8–2, including a 35-game winning streak. Between 1935 and 1940, the team won the state football championship six times and won the High School Football National Championship four times, outscoring opponents by 2,393 points to 168 over that span. After the early losses to Canton, the Tigers beat the Bulldogs six straight times.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April 1957, {{the signal}} box was {{destroyed}} by a fire due to an electrical fault. The station was consequently put out of action. Using <b>hand</b> <b>signals,</b> a skeleton service {{was put in place}} on 8 April. A temporary signal box was erected which came into operation on 5 May. Steam locomotives were temporarily banned from using the station, with Hastings Units being introduced into service earlier than planned. A full service was resumed from 6 May. Construction of a new signal box began on 19 April and it came into service on 16 December.|$|E

5|$|Underwater diver {{training}} is normally {{given by a}} qualified instructor {{who is a member}} of one of many diver training agencies or is registered with a government agency. Basic diver training entails the learning of skills required for the safe conduct of activities in an underwater environment, and includes procedures and skills for the use of diving equipment, safety, emergency self-help and rescue procedures, dive planning, and use of dive tables. Diving <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> are used to communicate underwater. Professional divers will also learn other methods of communication.|$|E
5|$|Purebred rough collie Lad and his owners, Stephen (Peter Breck) and Elizabeth Tremayne (Peggy McCay), are {{visited by}} their wealthy {{neighbor}} Hamilcar Q. Glure (Carroll O'Connor) and his 8-year-old daughter Angela (Angela Cartwright), who is crippled from polio. While Lad befriends the girl, Glure invites the Tremaynes {{to show the}} prize-winning Lad at his upcoming dog show. However, Glure is jealous of Lad's success and has rigged one event to have such specialized rules that he believes only his recently purchased high-priced, English-trained collie can win. During the competition, which involves directing the dogs through a tricky set of a maneuvers, Lad is able to complete the course, while Glure's champion does not recognize the <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> Glure makes while holding a cigar.|$|E
5|$|Risk {{management}} is {{obtained by the}} usual measures of engineering controls, administrative controls and procedures, and personal protective equipment, including hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA), protective equipment, medical screening, training and standardised procedures. Professional divers are generally legally obliged to carry out and formally record these measures, and though recreational divers are not legally required to do many of them, competent recreational divers, and particularly technical divers, generally perform them informally but routinely, and they {{are an important part}} of technical diver training. For example, a medical statement or examination for fitness, pre-dive site assessment and briefing, safety drills, thermal protection, equipment redundancy, alternative air source, buddy checks, buddy or team diving procedures, dive planning, underwater <b>hand</b> <b>signals,</b> and carrying first aid and oxygen administration equipment are all routinely part of technical diving.|$|E

5|$|While on {{the move}} the lead {{vehicles}} of the patrol commanders and sergeants flew a small flag. Because the LRP was organised on divisional cavalry lines the leaders carried green flags for 'A' (HQ) Troop, black for 'B' Troop, yellow for 'C' Troop and red for 'D'. When the LRDG was organised into 11 vehicle patrols this was simplified to a green flag displaying the patrol letter in white; the later half-patrols used a plain green flag on occasion. When it became necessary to change course from an intended route, or {{in the event of}} enemy action, patrol movements were controlled by a simple semaphore flag system using blue and white signal flags, or <b>hand</b> <b>signals,</b> depending on how widely dispersed the trucks were.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{and his men}} {{rested in}} Texas for several months before {{returning}} to Missouri. Although he learned that Union General Egbert B. Brown had devoted significant attention to the border area, Anderson led raids in Cooper and Johnson County, Missouri, robbing local residents. On June 12, Anderson and 50 of his men engaged 15 members of the Missouri State Militia, killing and robbing 12. After the attack, one of Anderson's guerrillas scalped a dead militiaman. The next day, in Southeast Jackson County, Anderson's group ambushed a wagon train carrying members of the Union 1st Northeast Missouri Cavalry, killing nine. The attacks prompted the Kansas City Daily Journal of Commerce to declare that rebels {{had taken over the}} area. Anderson and his men dressed as Union soldiers, wearing uniforms taken from those they killed. In response, Union militias developed <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> to verify that approaching men in Union uniforms were not guerrillas. The guerrillas, however, quickly learned the signals, and local citizens became wary of Union troops, fearing that they were disguised guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Knowles walking down an alley, {{accompanied}} by several men in suits, {{an homage to}} Quentin Tarantino's 1992 film Reservoir Dogs. As the main section of the song begins, cameras zoom in on Knowles as she dances in {{a black and white}} latex leotard while holding sunglasses with <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> on them. When the first verse begins, Knowles seductively dances for two men who have cameras as heads. Another scene shows her teasing men with futuristic toy guns while wearing a skin-colored latex top. During Gaga's verse, she and Knowles appear wearing white leotards; they both sing to the camera while shooting more toy guns in open fire. Knowles next brandishes a bow and fires arrows at a cameraman who's strapped to a rotating dart board. She and Gaga, now in front of a white backdrop, perform a synchronized dance together, with Gaga wearing a pair of yellow Louboutins heels. Knowles then appears dressed as an homage to Bettie Page, while handling several different firearms. Throughout the video, the two singers fire their guns and arrows at men. The video ends with Knowles shooting a gun while perched upon a stationary motorcycle and surrounded by images {{from the start of the}} video.|$|E

25|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>signals</b> are {{generally}} used when visibility allows, {{and there is}} a range of commonly used signals, with some variations. These signals are often also used as an alternative by professional divers. There is also a set of instructional <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> used during training. Recreational divers are expected to be familiar with the standard set of <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> used by their certification agency, and these have to a large extent been standardized internationally and are taught on entry level diving courses. A few additional specialised <b>hand</b> <b>signals</b> are commonly used by technical divers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>signals</b> are {{a form of}} sign {{system used}} by divers to {{communicate}} when underwater. <b>Hand</b> <b>signals</b> are useful whenever divers can see each other, and some {{can also be used}} in poor visibility if in close proximity, when the recipient can feel the shape of the signaller's hand and thereby identify the signal being given. At night the signal can be illuminated by the diver's light. <b>Hand</b> <b>signals</b> are the primary method of underwater communication for recreational scuba divers, and are also in general use by professional divers, usually as a secondary method.|$|E
