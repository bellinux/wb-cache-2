5|$|A MOS Technology 6502 {{chip that}} {{operates}} at 894kHz generates the sound effects, and a speech synthesizer by Votrax generates Q*bert's incoherent expressions. The audio system uses 128B of random-access memory and 4KB of <b>erasable</b> programmable {{read only memory}} to store the sound data and code to implement it. Like other Gottlieb games, the sound system was thoroughly tested to ensure it would handle daily usage. In retrospect, audio engineer David Thiel commented that such testing minimized time available for creative designing.|$|E
25|$|Paper {{companies}} {{produced a}} special form of typewriter paper called <b>erasable</b> bond (for example, Eaton's Corrasable Bond). This incorporated {{a thin layer}} of material that prevented ink from penetrating and was relatively soft and easy to remove from the page. An ordinary soft pencil eraser could quickly produce perfect erasures on this kind of paper. However, the same characteristics that made the paper <b>erasable</b> made the characters subject to smudging due to ordinary friction and deliberate alteration after the fact, making it unacceptable for business correspondence, contracts, or any archival use.|$|E
25|$|EPROMs (<b>Erasable</b> Programmable Read-Only Memory) are erased by {{exposure}} to UV radiation. These modules have a transparent (quartz) window {{on the top of}} the chip that allows the UV radiation in.|$|E
25|$|The Block I AGC {{initially}} had 12 kilowords {{of fixed}} memory, {{but this was}} later increased to 24 kilowords. Block II had 32 kilowords of fixed memory and 4 kilowords of <b>erasable</b> memory.|$|E
25|$|Block I AGC {{memory was}} {{organized}} into 1 kiloword banks. The lowest bank (bank 0) was <b>erasable</b> memory (RAM). All banks above bank 0 were fixed memory (ROM). Each AGC instruction had a 12-bit address field. The lower bits (1-10) addressed the memory inside each bank. Bits 11 and 12 selected the bank: 00 selected the <b>erasable</b> memory bank; 01 selected the lowest bank (bank 1) of fixed memory; 10 selected {{the next one}} (bank 2); and 11 selected the Bank register {{that could be used}} to select any bank above 2. Banks 1 and 2 were called fixed-fixed memory, because they were always available, regardless of the contents of the Bank register. Banks 3 and above were called fixed-switchable because the selected bank was determined by the bank register.|$|E
25|$|Toshiba {{developed}} {{flash memory}} from EEPROM (electrically <b>erasable</b> programmable read-only memory) {{in the early}} 1980s and introduced it to the market in 1984. The two main types of flash memory are named after the NAND and NOR logic gates. The individual flash memory cells exhibit internal characteristics {{similar to those of}} the corresponding gates.|$|E
25|$|The {{computer}} had 2048 {{words of}} <b>erasable</b> magnetic core memory and 36 kilowords of read-only core rope memory. Both had cycle times of 11.72microseconds. The memory word length was 16 bits: 15 bits {{of data and}} one odd-parity bit. The CPU-internal 16-bit word format was 14 bits of data, one overflow bit, and one sign bit (ones' complement representation).|$|E
25|$|The initial MyKad was {{a contact}} card {{solution}} developed and manufactured by IRIS Corporation. Made of PC with the dimensions in the ISO/IEC 7816 ID-1 format (standard credit card format), the initial card had a 32kb EEPROM (Electronically <b>Erasable</b> Programmable Read-Only Memory) embedded chip running on M-COS (MyKad Chip Operating System). In November 2002, the capacity was increased to 64kb.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{to expand the}} memory and instruction set for Block II, but to retain the Block I's restrictive three-bit op. code and 12-bit address had interesting design consequences. Various tricks were employed to squeeze in additional instructions, such as having special memory addresses which, when referenced, would implement a certain function. For instance, an INDEX to address 25 triggered the RESUME instruction to return from an interrupt. Likewise, INDEX 17 performed an INHINT instruction (inhibit interrupts), while INDEX 16 reenabled them (RELINT). Other instructions were implemented by preceding them with a special version of TC called EXTEND. The address spaces were extended by employing the Bank (fixed) and Ebank (<b>erasable)</b> registers, so the only memory of either type that could be addressed {{at any given time}} was the current bank, plus the small amount of fixed-fixed memory and the <b>erasable</b> memory. In addition, the bank register could address a maximum of 32 kilowords, so an Sbank (super-bank) register was required to access the last 4 kilowords. All across-bank subroutine calls had to be initiated from fixed-fixed memory through special functions to restore the original bank during the return: essentially a system of far pointers.|$|E
25|$|A Block II {{version of}} the AGC was {{designed}} in 1966. It retained the basic Block I architecture, but increased <b>erasable</b> memory from 1 to 2 kilowords. Fixed memory was expanded from 24 to 36 kilowords. Instructions were expanded from 11 to 34 and I/O channels were implemented to replace the I/O registers on Block I. The Block II version {{is the one that}} actually flew to the moon. Block I was used during the unmanned Apollo 4 and 6 flights, and was on board the ill-fated Apollo I.|$|E
25|$|The AGC {{transferred}} data to {{and from}} memory through the G register in a process called the memory cycle. The memory cycle took 12 timing pulses (11.72μs). The cycle began at timing pulse 1 (TP1) when the AGC loaded the memory address to be fetched into the S register. The memory hardware retrieved the data word from memory at the address specified by the S register. Words from <b>erasable</b> memory were deposited into the G register by timing pulse 6 (TP6); words from fixed memory were available by timing pulse 7. The retrieved memory word was then available in the G register for AGC access during timing pulses 7 through 10. After timing pulse 10, the data in the G register was written back to memory.|$|E
25|$|The CD {{was planned}} to be the {{successor}} of the vinyl record for playing music, rather than primarily as a data storage medium. From its origins as a musical format, CDs have grown to encompass other applications. In 1983, following the CD's introduction, Immink and Braat presented the first experiments with <b>erasable</b> compact discs during the 73rd AES Convention. In June 1985, the computer-readable CD-ROM (read-only memory) and, in 1990, CD-Recordable were introduced, also developed by both Sony and Philips. Recordable CDs were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods. Other newer video formats such as DVD and Blu-ray use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are backward compatible with audio CD.|$|E
2500|$|Ballpoint pens with [...] "erasable ink" [...] were {{pioneered by}} the Paper Mate pen company. The ink {{formulas}} of <b>erasable</b> ballpoints have properties similar to rubber cement, allowing the ink to be literally rubbed clean from the writing surface before drying and eventually becoming permanent. <b>Erasable</b> ink is much thicker than standard ballpoint inks, requiring pressurised cartridges to facilitate inkflow—meaning {{they can also}} write upside-down. Though these pens are equipped with erasers, any eraser will suffice.|$|E
2500|$|XCH (exchange): Exchange the {{contents}} of memory with {{the contents}} of the A register. If the specified memory address is in fixed (read-only) memory, the memory contents are not affected, and this instruction simply loads register A. If it is in <b>erasable</b> memory, overflow [...] "correction" [...] is achieved by storing the leftmost of the 16 bits in A as the sign bit in memory, but there is no exceptional behavior like that of TS.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{flash memory}} is {{technically}} {{a type of}} EEPROM, the term [...] "EEPROM" [...] is generally used to refer specifically to non-flash EEPROM which is <b>erasable</b> in small blocks, typically bytes. Because erase cycles are slow, the large block sizes used in flash memory erasing give it a significant speed advantage over non-flash EEPROM when writing large amounts of data. , flash memory costs much less than byte-programmable EEPROM and had become the dominant memory type wherever a system required {{a significant amount of}} non-volatile solid-state storage.|$|E
2500|$|Information {{about each}} {{starship}} (or base or space monster) is fully contained on ship diagrams (one {{on each side}} of a single ship card). Colour-coded boxes over the ship's silhouette represent its weapons, shields, number of shuttlecraft, available warp and impulse power etc. Each starship has one diagram in a more detailed Squadron scale - the kind of scale seen in Star Fleet Battles - and another, more simplified one in Fleet scale - a similar scale to the Cadet scale seen in SFB. (Examples of ship cards in PDF format may be found [...]) Ship cards are laminated with plastic so that they may be written upon with <b>erasable</b> markers and reused, obviating the need to photocopy multiple copies of ship information.|$|E

50|$|The {{whiteboard}} pen (also {{called a}} whiteboard marker or dry <b>erasable</b> marker) {{was invented by}} Jerry Woolf of Techform Laboratories and later patented by Pilot Pen in 1975. It is a non-permanent marker and uses an <b>erasable</b> ink that adheres to the writing surface without binding to or being absorbed by it. Applications range from temporary writing with acetate sheets (for use with overhead projectors) to whiteboards and similar glossy surfaces. The <b>erasable</b> ink does not contain the toxic chemical compounds xylene and/or toluene, unlike permanent markers.|$|E
