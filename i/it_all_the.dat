5|$|After {{defeating}} Harris at TNA's Victory Road PPV {{event on}} July 17, 2007 and Tomko, Styles, and he {{losing to the}} team of Andrew Martin, Sting, and Abyss at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August 12, 2007 in a Doomsday Chamber of Blood match to become number one contender to the TNA Title, Cage restarted his feud with Samoa Joe. The two met at TNA's No Surrender PPV event on September 9, 2007, where Cage defeated Joe by disqualification when Joe refused to release his Coquina Clutch submission hold he had applied. The two had a rematch on October 14, 2007 at TNA's Bound for Glory PPV event with Matt Morgan as the special outside enforcer. There, Joe defeated Cage to end his 23-month-long undefeated streak by not officially being pinned nor made to submit. Cage and Joe fought one {{more time on the}} October 18, 2007 episode of Impact!, with a spot in the 2007 Fight for the Right tournament to become number one contender to the TNA Championship. Cage defeated Joe to gain entry. Cage made <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to the final round of the tournament, where he fought Kaz on the November 8, 2007 episode of Impact!. Cage defeated Kaz, but due to interference from Styles and Tomko on Cage's behalf, the match was declared a no contest, with the finals being determined on November 11, 2007 at TNA's Genesis PPV event in a ladder match. Cage, however, failed to win the tournament final the second time around at Genesis.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} all 16 {{games at}} outside cornerback in 2014, Munnerlyn settled into nickel back role, playing in all 16 regular season games with five starts {{as well as}} the Wild Card Round of the playoffs. He helped the Vikings defensive unit rank fifth in the NFL in defensive points allowed at 18.9 points per game, playing {{a key role in the}} Vikings winning the NFC North title over long-time reigning champs Green Bay Packers for the first time since 2009. In Week 10, he started the game at Oakland and posted a season-best 7 tackles against the Raiders. Four weeks later, he recorded seven solo tackles again in the loss at Arizona Cardinals on December 20. He posted his first sack as a Viking when he corralled Packers' quarterback Aaron Rodgers in Week 11. The following week, he got his first pick of the season when he intercepted Falcons' quarterback Matt Ryan. In the final game of the regular season against the Green Bay Packers for the NFC North title, the Vikings had a 13-3 lead with just over four minutes remaining in the third quarter. On a 3rd-and-12 play, Aaron Rodgers dropped back to his own 45-yard line to make a pass, but Vikings defensive end Everson Griffen got a hand on Rodgers' arm, causing him to fumble; Munnerlyn scooped up the ball at the 55-yard line and with blocking support from safety Andrew Sendejo and linebacker Anthony Barr, ran <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way back for a touchdown (his first on a fumble recovery). Munnerlyn recorded 55 tackles, a sack, one fumble recovery for a touchdown, 2 interceptions, and 4 pass deflections in his second season in Minnesota.|$|E

5|$|As they {{continue}} walking, SpongeBob constantly sings {{a song about}} how the Krusty Krab pizza is the best pizza on the sea floor, which annoys Squidward. The two gradually become tired and hungry, so SpongeBob suggests they eat coral like the pioneers. Squidward immediately spits out the coral, disgusted by the taste, and demands SpongeBob hand over the pizza so he can eat it, having finally given up hope on getting back to civilization. SpongeBob refuses and a short chase ensues between the two. Just as Squidward is about to grab the pizza, SpongeBob notices a giant rock that he claims the pioneers drove for miles. Incredulous at this claim, Squidward tries to tell SpongeBob {{to forget about the}} pioneers, saying that there are none left because of their unusual travelling methods. He quickly changes his mind after SpongeBob runs him over with the rock and they drive <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to the customer's house.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, the Patriots {{had some}} success, earning a berth {{to the playoffs}} in 1976—as a wild card team—and in 1978—as AFC East champions. They lost {{in the first round}} both times. In 1985, they {{returned}} to the playoffs, and made <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to Super Bowl XX, which they lost to the Chicago Bears 46–10. Following their Super Bowl loss, they returned to the playoffs in 1986, but lost in the first round. The team would not make the playoffs again for eight more years. During the 1990 season, the Patriots went 1–15. They changed ownership three times in the ensuing 14 years, being purchased from the Sullivan family first by Victor Kiam in 1988, who sold the team to James Orthwein in 1992. Orthwein intended to move the team to his native St. Louis, Missouri (where it would have been renamed as the St. Louis Stallions), but instead sold the team in 1994 to its current owner Robert Kraft.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, however, Cincinnati's offense managed to begin moving the ball effectively. On Cincinnati’s first {{play of the}} second half, halfback Roger Stephens broke through the Virginia Tech {{defensive}} line for 26 yards, taking the ball inside Virginia Tech territory. Cincinnati's drive would overcome two 15-yard penalties and one five-yard penalty {{en route to a}} touchdown just a few plays later. On its next possession, Cincinnati's All-American Roger Stephens again broke off another long run, this time for 19 yards, setting up another Bearcats' touchdown. Virginia Tech countered with a long drive that reached the Cincinnati 23-yard line before an errant pass was intercepted by the Bearcats in the end zone. Virginia Tech managed a defensive stop, however, and marched down the field for a touchdown to climb within six points. Cincinnati sealed its victory, however, when Bearcats' halfback Harold Johnson intercepted a Virginia Tech pass late in the fourth quarter, returning <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to the Virginia Tech 25-yard line. That return set up a Cincinnati touchdown and put the Bearcats up by the game's final score, 18–6.|$|E

5|$|M-66 was {{extended}} southerly from Assyria through Battle Creek to the Indiana state line replacing sections of M-78 in 1965. M-66 turned {{south and west}} along M-60 and new highway to Colon. The segment of former M-78 not used by M-66 was transferred to local control. The final section of M-78's roadway given to M-66 extended <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to the state line, resulting in a north–south trans-peninsular highway from Lake Michigan near Charlevoix to Indiana. M-66 is the only such highway to run {{the length of the}} Lower Peninsula. The extension allowed the Green Arrow Association to promote the whole length of the Green Arrow Route with a single highway number. The next year, M-66 was rerouted through Battle Creek to use the completed I-194 freeway.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{are among}} the very few native species of Australia that are not harmed by the toxins of the cane toad, an {{invasive}} species. Most of the time, foraging workers target metamorph toads. Observations show that workers would forage around ponds and seize any toadlet. This normally starts with a single worker making contact with an individual and tracing its movements, followed by three or four workers capturing <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> participating ants would grab a limb and sever the legs, returning the prey item back to their nest. Most of the time these tactics do not work. For example, most toadlets are able to escape the ants by displaying aversion-like behaviour; an individual may escape by struggling erratically or forcing the ants to release their grip by returning to the water. This aversion behaviour leads to most toadlets remaining in the water or staying on objects such as water lilies, pieces of bark that the ants cannot access, or moving around on moist substrates. It is unknown if meat ant predation on the toadlets affected the population, but based on the population density of the toadlets within the studied site and the foraging time and efficiency, approximately 2,700 toadlets could be removed per day. As the toadlet population density is extremely high, the impact of meat ant predation is minor. However, the survivability of the toadlets may be affected if the ants prevent the toadlets from foraging into many areas of moist substrate.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility for the {{expedition}} {{was given to}} Sivert Klevan, an engineer with a good instinct for public relations.

Instead, 200kg blocks were cut out with a chainsaw, carried away on a sled, and flown by helicopter down to the town centre. There they were melted together to make a block of ice weighing 3,050kg. The block was placed in a specially constructed iron container, which was insulated with wood and glass wool. The container was placed on top of a truck that would carry <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to the Equator, accompanied by a van carrying equipment and a sedan with a film crew.|$|E
5|$|When the sinoatrial {{cells are}} resting, {{they have a}} {{negative}} charge on their membranes. However a rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane's charge to become positive. This is called depolarisation and occurs spontaneously. Once the cell has a sufficiently high charge, the sodium channels close and calcium ions then begin to enter the cell, shortly after which potassium begins to leave <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> ions travel through ion channels in the membrane of the sinoatrial cells. The potassium and calcium only start {{to move out of}} and into the cell once it has a sufficiently high charge, and so are called voltage-gated. Shortly after this, the calcium channels close and potassium channels open, allowing potassium to leave the cell. This causes the cell to have a negative resting charge and is called repolarization. When the membrane potential reaches approximately −60 mV, the potassium channels close and the process may begin again.|$|E
