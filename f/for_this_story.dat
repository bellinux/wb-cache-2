5|$|Written by Johnny Byrne, a plot outline <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> {{also known}} as The Place of Serenity, was {{submitted}} to the production office by Byrne in July 1983. The two-part story {{would have seen the}} Doctor visit the planet Serenity, {{which is part of the}} same union that Traken belonged to. The rulers of Serenity are assisted by a computer known as Prophecy and the villains of the piece, Auga and Mura, are attempting to overthrow the rulers. It was later adapted by Jonathan Morris for Big Finish as part of their The Lost Stories series in May 2012.|$|E
5|$|As Baz, {{the player}} {{searches}} for Reg and Tel. Timmy, a Smartie rescued {{in the first}} mission, functions {{as a guide for}} the player: introducing other Smartie characters, and providing exposition of the scenario. The plot portrays the Smarties as suffering under the reign of the Sea Reapers and their Queen Sappho. Alluding to the film, The Magnificent Seven, Baz gathers the separated Meccaryns, and takes on a quest to solve the Smarties' predicaments. In a climactic cut scene, Sappho sacrifices Timmy to Kabuto, and the young Smartie's grandfather, Borjoyzee, becomes the player's guide. Baz leads an escape from the area, and sets up a base to lead a counterattack. Thereafter Delphi becomes the player's character. Yan, the Samurai Smartie serves as the guide <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> segment, giving instructions on Delphi's abilities. After completing the training missions under Yan, Delphi attacks Sappho's base and the Reapers, eventually confronting the queen in a boss fight. When defeated, Sappho summons Kabuto to destroy the Smarties, but Kabuto eats her instead.|$|E
5|$|When {{a chance}} arose {{for him to}} escape to a safe country, Edwin chose to remain at Rædwald's court. He was then visited by a {{stranger}} who was aware of Rædwald's deliberations. The source <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> written at Whitby, stated that the stranger was Paulinus of York, {{a member of the}} Canterbury mission, who offered Edwin the hope of Rædwald's support and held out the prospect that Edwin might someday attain greater royal power than any previous English king. Paulinus was assured by Edwin that he would accept his religious teaching. His vision of Paulinus was afterwards made the means of his decision to embrace Christianity, on the condition that he survived and achieved power. If, as is supposed by some, Paulinus appeared to him in the flesh, the bishop's presence at Rædwald's court would throw some light on the king's position regarding religion.|$|E

25|$|The {{frequent}} {{allegation that}} Wagner {{had an affair}} with the singer Carrie Pringle, and that an argument about this with his wife Cosima precipitated his fatal heart attack, is discussed and dismissed as invention by the Wagner scholar Stewart Spencer, who demonstrates that there is no first-hand or documentary evidence <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E

25|$|In an {{open letter}} to De Volkskrant {{on the day of the}} Dutch elections, defense {{minister}} Kamp said the news about possible mistreatment was deceptive, and that the editor of De Volkskrant should feel being misused by the sources <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story.</b> The Department of Defense in the mean time is demanding a rectification of the story published by De Volkskrant.|$|E

25|$|In Vishnu Purana, Vayu Purana and Padma Purana, a curse that Durvasa laid upon Indra is {{described}} as the indirect reason for the famous churning of the ocean. The Srimad Bhagavata and Agni Purana also mention Durvasa's involvement in the episode in passing, without going into the details. Other sources <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> such as Ramayana, Mahabharata, Harivamsa and Matsya Purana, do not mention Durvasa's involvement at all and ascribe the incident to other causes, such as the devas' and asuras' desire for immortality.|$|E
25|$|Working titles <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> {{included}} Doctor Who and the Gift, The Friendly Invasion, The Axons, and The Vampire from Space. The last {{title was}} used through {{the production of}} the first two episodes, and was only changed by the time filming began on the third. The DVD release contains unused footage and cuts from the story that are packaged with the original title sequence – naming the story as The Vampire from Space. The serial was envisaged to be a six-parter, but the concept of the storyline changed as development progressed.|$|E
25|$|Peter Bryant, who had {{previously}} been assistant to Gerry Davis and been newly promoted to script editor on the preceding story, was allowed to produce this serial {{in order to prove}} that he could take over from Innes Lloyd as producer later on in the season. Bryant's own assistant, Victor Pemberton acted as script editor on this serial, but left the series after production of the serial was finished, deciding that he didn't want to be a script editor. When Bryant's eventual promotion to producer came, Derrick Sherwin would become script editor. The working titles <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> were The Ice Tombs of Telos and The Cybermen Planet.|$|E

25|$|Robot {{was written}} by Terrance Dicks, who had joined the series in 1968 as {{assistant}} script editor and took over the script editor position soon after. Dicks stated that a major influence <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> was King Kong. The initial script was written before Tom Baker had been cast as the Fourth Doctor, {{and there was some}} discussion of returning to an older actor. This would have required a younger character to handle the action scenes, so the character of Harry Sullivan was created. This was Sullivan's debut story, but he had been mentioned in the final episode of the preceding serial, when the Brigadier telephoned him, requesting medical help for the Doctor.|$|E
25|$|Journalist and {{historian}} Peter Hennessy {{has made an}} assertion, {{in one of his}} books, that a test that the commander of a British nuclear-missile submarine must use to determine whether the UK has been the target of a nuclear attack (in which case he has sealed orders which may authorise him to fire his nuclear missiles in retaliation), is to listen for the presence of Today on Radio 4's frequencies. If a certain number of days (said to be three) pass without the programme being broadcast, that is to be taken as evidence that the orders must be executed. The true conditions are of course secret, and Hennessy has never revealed his sources <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> leading Paul Donovan, author of a book about Today, to express some scepticism about it. However, the longwave signal of Radio 4 is capable of penetrating to surface depths where submarines can rise, although it does not have the range required to be heard at this depth far from the UK's coastal waters.|$|E
25|$|The Dæmons began {{life as an}} {{audition}} scene for the companion Jo Grant. The audition sequence went on {{to be written into}} episode four. Producer Barry Letts was keen to write for the show and decided that a story dealing in black magic would be interesting as well as frightening. Script editor Terrance Dicks had reservations however, stating that people may view it as Satanist, and so it was reworked as strictly scientific with occultist themes. The Master was originally intended to worship the demon in a church set, standing on an altar. However, owing to fears that this might upset religious viewers, the scenes were reset in a crypt. This was subsequently revised again, and the crypt was called a cavern, although the set clearly resembled a church crypt. Letts initially intended to write the story himself but found himself short of time due to producership duties. His wife suggested a friend of hers, Robert Sloman, who was a playwright and journalist. Together they worked on the script in the evening after work. At the time, however, the BBC frowned upon production staff writing for their own series and so Letts and Sloman decided on the pseudonym Guy Leopold - Sloman's son and Letts' middle name respectively. The working title <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> was The Demons, which was commissioned on 17 December 1970. The scripts were completed by mid-February 1971 and worked on by Dicks, who had barely completed work on them by the time the story went into pre-production in March.|$|E

5000|$|Go See Eddie was {{initially}} submitted to Story magazine and then Esquire before being accepted by The University Review, {{now known as}} New Letters.

500|$|The working titles <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> {{included}} [...] "The Crippingwell Horror" [...] and [...] "The Angels of Crippingwell". The original {{draft was}} grimmer, including {{details about the}} previous death of Gwyneth's younger brother, but in subsequent drafts the story became more of a [...] "romp". Gatiss stated that the name [...] "Gelth" [...] simply popped into his head. Gatiss was encouraged to personify the Gelth, which he originally questioned because he felt that monsters whispering [...] "Doctor" [...] was a cliché; producer Phil Collinson remarked that {{perhaps it was a}} cliché because it worked well. The Rift was added into the plot to simplify the Gelth's origins.|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} The Shooting Scripts, Russell T Davies {{claims that he}} had {{originally}} set out to write this episode from Adam's perspective, watching the adventure unfolding {{from his point of}} view (exactly as Rose did in [...] "Rose") and seeing both the Doctor and Rose as enigmatic, frightening characters. He even gave this outline a working title: [...] "Adam". Another working title <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> was [...] "The Companion Who Couldn't". According to Davies, the concept of [...] "The Long Game" [...] was originally written in the early 1980s and submitted to the Doctor Who production office. Whether it was ever read by the production team of the time is unclear, as Davies received a rejection from the BBC Script Unit, who advised him to write more realistic television about [...] "a man and his mortgage" [...] instead. Davies reworked the story for the new series.|$|E
500|$|Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier {{deemed the}} anti-Semitism a [...] "sad moment" [...] in the series, {{awarding}} the story {{one out of}} five stars. Nevertheless, they felt that the [...] "pre-apocalyptic ambiance is stark and believable", and that the giant mushrooms on the meteorite were a [...] "strange anticipation" [...] of the mushroom-clouds produced by the atomic bombings in 1945. Focusing on the characters of Professor Phostle and Philippulus, they asserted that both resembled Sophocles Sarcophagus from Cigars of the Pharaoh and that the former was [...] "in the Jules Verne tradition" [...] of eccentric professors. According to philosopher Pascal Bruckner, Tintin experts find Philippulus a caricature of Marshal of France Philippe Pétain, who demanded the French repent imaginary sins when he took power. Philippe Goddin stated that the strips <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> [...] "kept the reader daily on tenterhooks in a story replete with new twists and humour".|$|E

500|$|... {{wanted to}} do a frog story for some time, because it was amusing and offered the {{opportunity}} for the naturalist illustrations she delighted in... The story of a fisherman down on his luck reminded Beatrix of the 'fish stories' her father's friends had told in Scotland, as well as her brother's travails with rod and reel. She also recreated the gentlemen's club atmosphere absorbed from her father's reports of evenings spent at the Reform and the Athenaeum... The text and illustrations <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> {{are some of the most}} balanced and compatible of all her writing. Nature is described and illustrated truthfully: beautifully tranquil as well as unpredictably aggressive....Its carefully coloured botanical backgrounds of water plants, a frog with anatomically correct turned-out feet, a trout that any self-respecting fisherman would enjoy snagging, and a rather frighteningly rendered water-beetle who tweaks Jeremy's dainty toes, all made it a delight to look at as well as to read.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{writer for}} The Star-Ledger, said Michael acted so [...] "nakedly selfish and unfeeling" [...] {{that it made}} the episode unpleasant to watch: [...] "If last week's 'Blood Drive' gave us Michael at his most human and sympathetic, then 'Golden Ticket' showed how a human Michael {{could also be a}} monster." [...] However, Sepinwall said he did think the subplot involving Kevin receiving romantic advice was funny and sweet: [...] "Brian Baumgartner's just been aces the last two weeks, and if it hadn't been <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> I might have found 'Golden Ticket' unbearable." [...] Dan Hopper of VH1's Best Week Ever strongly criticized the episode and the behavior of the characters: [...] "Why was every single character on last night’s Willy Wonka episode acting like a complete idiot? Not 'idiot' {{in the sense that the}} characters are always dumb and goofy in an amusing way, but 'idiot' as in 'none of these human beings would ever act this way and this is really frustrating to watch? ...|$|E
500|$|John Keegan from Critical Myth {{gave the}} episode a largely {{negative}} review and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode was a disappointing sequel {{to one of}} the most popular episodes of the series. Bringing back Modell <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> was an ill-advised attempt to capitalize on impressions of continuity, especially since the character aspects of 'Pusher' were completely absent this time around. It's hard to believe that Vince and Tim, both strong writers on their own, were responsible for this material." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She called the entry [...] "tame" [...] compared to its original, although she understood the show's desire to write a sequel. Vitaris also criticized the fact that Modell never murdered anyone and called the episode's basic plot [...] "cheesy". She did, however, compliment several of the episode's set pieces, such as [...] "Nathan Bowman covered in cerulean blue paint"—which she called [...] "striking"—and the scene wherein [...] "Linda stops the heart of the suffering Modell", calling the latter [...] "sensately performed." ...|$|E
