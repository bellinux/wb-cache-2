5|$|The {{family had}} reached a {{significant}} position within their community: Ștefan sin Petre had made a steady income from his itinerant trade in wool, while his wife was the descendant of the Creangăs of Pipirig, a family of community leaders. The latter's members included Moldavian Metropolitan Iacob Stamati, as well as Smaranda's father, Vornic David, and her uncle Ciubuc Clopotarul, a monk at Neamț Monastery. Proud of this tradition, it was her who insisted for her son {{to pursue a career}} in the Church. According to his own recollection, the future writer was born on March 1, 1837—a date which has since been challenged. Creangă's other statements mention March 2, 1837, or an unknown date in 1836. The exactitude of other accounts is equally unreliable: community registers from the period gave the date of June 10, 1839, and mention another child of the same name being born to his parents on February 4, 1842 (the more probable birth date of Creangă's younger brother Zahei). The imprecision also touches other aspects of his family life: noting the resulting conflicts in data, Călinescu decided that it was not possible for one to know if the writer's parents were married to each other (and, if so, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> their first marriage), nor how many children they had together. At a time when family names were not legally required, and people were primarily known by various nicknames and patronymics, the boy was known to the community as Nică, a hypocorism formed from Ion, or more formally as Nică al lui Ștefan a Petrei ("Nică of Ștefan of Petru", occasionally Nic-a lui Ștefan a Petrei).|$|E
25|$|Insects {{that had}} evolved their proto-wings {{in a world}} without flying predators could afford to be exposed openly without risk, but this changed when {{carnivorous}} flying insects evolved. It is unknown when they first evolved, but once these predators had emerged they put a strong selection pressure on their victims and themselves. Those of the prey {{who came up with}} a good solution about how to fold their wings over their backs {{in a way that made}} it possible for them to live in narrow spaces would not only be able to hide from flying predators (and terrestrial predators <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> the ground) but also to exploit a wide variety of niches that were closed to those who couldn't fold their wings in this way. And today the neopterous insects (those that can fold their wings back over the abdomen) are by far the most dominant group of insects.|$|E
25|$|One {{conclusion}} of Black's 2011 report concerned the sickness benefits system. Black felt {{that too many}} claims for the out-of-work sickness benefit Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) {{did not meet the}} threshold for eligibility, yet a Work Capability Assessment (WCA) only took place after an 'assessment phase' lasting at least 13 weeks (during which, the claimant is nominally paid ESA but, in practice, receives {{the same amount of money}} as they would <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> Jobseekers Allowance). She was concerned that this phase might wrongly lead some patients to believe that they were too ill to work - because they were receiving 'assessment rate' ESA and because their GP had indicated that they were not fit for work on the medical certificate needed to initiate a claim - and that it represented a substantial delay in returning to work for those claimants who would later be judged able to work despite their chronic illness or disability; she therefore recommended that the assessment phase be abolished and that ESA only be considered after a WCA has taken place and the claimant has been found unfit for work.|$|E

500|$|Richard H. Kline {{served as}} the film's cinematographer. Working from sketch artist Maurice Zuberano's concepts, Wise would judge <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> the right track. Kline and Michelson would then discuss the look they wanted (along with Weldon, if effects were involved.) Each {{sequence}} was then storyboarded and left to Kline to execute. The cinematographer called his function to [...] "interpret [...] preplanning and make it indelible on film. It's a way of everybody being on the same wavelength." [...] Kline would recall {{that there was not}} a single [...] "easy" [...] shot to produce for the picture, as each scene required special consideration. The bridge, for example, was lit with a low density of light to make the console monitors display better. It was hard to frame shots so that reflections of the crew in monitors or light spilling through floor grilles were not seen in the final print.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{described}} the incident for Dolan in far more detail. He {{said that on}} 25 June he had finished his woodworking job at 15:00, refused to work overtime (having put in 62 hours that week), then drunk six beers at home during the afternoon and gone to sleep at 21:00. He woke up soon after, he said, and loaded his uncle's shotgun, intending to kill himself. [...] "Next thing I knew," [...] he continued, [...] "I was on the street." [...] He told Dolan {{that he had seen}} people [...] "as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> television". He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a voice that was not his own saying [...] "Put up your hands". He then remembered hearing the dim, far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street, seeing a girl's outline in a doorway and [...] "somehow" [...] shooting at her. Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that [...] "everything seemed unreal." [...] He said that the next thing he had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking [...] "what the hell am I in here for" [...] and leaving. He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of Pillette and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle's house.|$|E

There are fourteen numbered nodal stations. Lymph nodes considered {{to be in the}} mediastinum are stations 1-9, which are thus potential N2 or N3 locations, while stations 10-14 are hilar and peripheral nodes, and thus potential N1 locations.|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] "hyperlink" [...] {{was coined}} in 1965 (or {{possibly}} 1964) by Ted Nelson {{at the start}} of Project Xanadu. Nelson had been inspired by [...] "As We May Think", a popular 1945 essay by Vannevar Bush. In the essay, Bush described a microfilm-based machine (the Memex) in which one could link any two pages of information into a [...] "trail" [...] of related information, and then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> a single microfilm reel.|$|E

2500|$|Further {{criticism}} came in November 2007, when Bono's various charity campaigns {{were targeted}} by Jobs Selasie, head of African Aid Action. Selasie claimed that these charities had increased corruption and dependency in Africa because {{they failed to}} work with African entrepreneurs and grassroots organisations, and as a result, Africa has become more dependent on international handouts. Bono responded to his critics in Times Online on 19 February 2006, calling them [...] "cranks carping from the sidelines.

At some point in this 'assessment phase' - in theory, after thirteen weeks, but, since 2013, very much longer - a Work Capability Assessment will normally be carried out to determine whether the claimant: a) is disabled enough to qualify for a higher rate of ESA or b) does not, in fact, qualify for ESA at all. Each assessment usually takes {{about an hour and a}} half and costs the DWP around £190.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{educational}} setting, a PLC may include people from multiple {{levels of the}} organization who are collaboratively and continually working together {{for the betterment of}} the organization. Peter Senge believes [...] "it is no longer sufficient to have one person learning for the organization". A major principle of PLCs is that people learn more together than <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> their own, if conditions are right. Teachers may promote the idea of team learning to students in their classrooms, but teachers may not practice team learning in their professional lives; PLCs aim to help teachers practice the team learning that they preach. Senge suggests that when teams learn together there are beneficial results for the organization. Some school improvement evaluators have even claimed that [...] "high-quality collaboration has become no less than an imperative".|$|E
2500|$|Jeckeln {{convened a}} second {{planning}} session of senior commanders {{on the afternoon}} of Saturday, November 29, 1941, this time at the Ritterhaus.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the glass ceiling, which already is stopping women from climbing higher in success in the workplace, a parallel phenomenon called the [...] "glass escalator" [...] is occurring. This {{can be defined as}} how more men are joining fields that were previously occupied mainly by women, such as nursing and teaching, and within these job fields, the men are riding right past women and going straight to the top, similarly to <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> an escalator and a woman was taking stairs. Men are being offered more promotions than women and even though women have worked just as hard, they are still not being offered the same chances as men are in some circumstances. The chart from Carolyn K. Broner, Ph.D. shows an example of the glass escalator in favor of men for female-dominant occupations in schools. While women have mostly occupied the position of teachers, men are taking the higher positions in school systems as deans or principals.|$|E

She added, [...] "No preview, absolutely not". On December 20, 2009, Barr posted an entry on her Web site regarding what a possible Roseanne reunion would be like, which includes: DJ's being published, Mark's dying in Iraq; David's leaving Darlene for a woman half his age, Darlene coming out of the closet and meeting a woman and having a test tube baby with her, Becky's working at Walmart, Roseanne and Jackie's opening the first medical marijuana dispensary in Lanford, Arnie's becoming the best friend of the Governor of Illinois and remarrying Nancy, Bev's selling a painting for $10,000, Jerry and the grandsons forming a music group similar to the Jonas Brothers, Dan's reappearing alive after faking his death, and Bonnie's being arrested for selling crack.|$|E
2500|$|After a tackle, a ruck will {{sometimes}} form. This occurs when {{at least one}} player from each side bind onto each other with {{the ball on the}} ground between them. Additional players may join the ruck, but must do so from behind the rearmost foot of the hindmost team mate in the ruck (often referred to as [...] "coming through the gate") and bind onto the body of a team mate. The offside line for uninvolved players is perpendicular to the last feet of the rearmost player on their side of the ruck and they must remain behind this line until the ball emerges. In a ruck, no player may use their hands to win the ball, except <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> their feet and had their hands on the ball before the ruck formed. Teams try to win the ball by pushing the opposition off it or by using their feet to [...] "ruck" [...] it to their side. One player (in many cases the scrum-half) directly behind the ruck may reach in and retrieve the ball from the ruck provided they do not participate in the ruck (that is, they do not bind on to an opponent) and stay behind the offside line. [...] A player doing so may not be tackled or grasped by an opponent in the ruck until he or she has played the ball, as this would violate the laws on tackling players without the ball. Players in a ruck must stay on their feet and not deliberately ruck or step on players lying on the ground. Players who are on the ground at a ruck must not impede the ball as it emerges from the ruck. The ruck ends when the ball emerges, a player commits an offence and is penalised or it becomes unplayable and a scrum is awarded. An amendment to the laws on this point is currently being trialled, under which a team which is able to retrieve the ball from the ruck must do so within five seconds. [...] This is to prevent time-wasting; for instance by a team which is leading {{as the end of the}} game approaches.|$|E
