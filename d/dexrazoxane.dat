Our results show that <b>dexrazoxane</b> was not genotoxic at the tested doses.

Pretreatment of mice with <b>dexrazoxane</b> before epirubicin challenge restored these altered endpoints. We conclude that <b>dexrazoxane</b> may efficiently mitigate the epirubicin insult in male germ cells, and prevent the enhanced risk of abnormal reproductive outcomes and associated health risks.

Custom angiogenesis pathway microarrays were used to identify differentially expressed genes in endothelial cells after treatment with <b>dexrazoxane</b> vs a control.

Its activity has traditionally been attributed to the iron-chelating effects of its metabolite with subsequent protection from oxidative stress. However, <b>dexrazoxane</b> is also a catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase II (TOP 2). Therefore, we examined whether <b>dexrazoxane</b> and two other TOP 2 catalytic inhibitors, namely sobuzoxane (MST- 16) and merbarone, protect cardiomyocytes from anthracycline toxicity and assessed their effects on anthracycline antineoplastic efficacy. <b>Dexrazoxane</b> and two other TOP 2 inhibitors protected isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes against toxicity induced by both doxorubicin and daunorubicin.

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of the present study}} was to answer the question whether the catalytic topoisomerase-II inhibitor, <b>dexrazoxane,</b> can be used as a modulator of teniposide-induced DNA damage and programmed cell death (apoptosis) in the bone marrow cells in vivo. The alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis, scoring of chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei and mitotic activity were undertaken in the current study as markers of DNA damage. Apoptosis was analysed by the occurrence of a hypodiploid DNA peak and caspase- 3 activity. Oxidative stress marker such as intracellular reactive oxygen species production, lipid peroxidation, reduced and oxidised glutathione were assessed in bone marrow as a possible mechanism underlying this amelioration. <b>Dexrazoxane</b> was neither genotoxic nor apoptogenic in mice at the tested dose. Moreover, for the first time, it has been shown that <b>dexrazoxane</b> affords significant protection against teniposide-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in the bone marrow cells in vivo and effectively suppresses the apoptotic signalling triggered by teniposide. Teniposide induced marked biochemical alterations characteristic of oxidative stress including accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, enhanced lipid peroxidation, accumulation of oxidised glutathione and reduction in the reduced glutathione level. Prior administration of <b>dexrazoxane</b> ahead of teniposide challenge ameliorated these biochemical alterations.
