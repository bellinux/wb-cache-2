5|$|A {{defining}} and best-known {{feature of the}} Mortal Kombat series is its finishing move system called Fatality. An original idea behind it was to give gamers a free hit {{at the end of}} the fight. The basic Fatalities are finishing moves that allow the victorious characters to end a match in a special way by murdering their defeated, defenseless opponents in a gruesome manner, usually in the predefined ways exclusive for the given character. The only exception from this is Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, which instead features the Kreate-A-Fatality, allowing the players to perform their own Fatalities by conducting a series of violent moves chosen from a pool that <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> all characters.|$|E

After Jesus' death, many {{members of his family}} joined the Christian movement. Jesus' brother James became a leader of the Jerusalem Church.|$|E

5|$|Château Gaillard {{consists}} of three baileys—an inner, a middle, and an outer with the main entrance to the castle—and a keep, also called a donjon, in the inner-bailey. The baileys, which were separated by rock-cut ditches, housed the castle's stables, workshops, and storage facilities. It <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> extant castles {{to be the result}} of several phases of construction, and were adapted and added to over the period of their use; however Château Gaillard essentially is the result of one period of building. The division into three wards bears similarities with the design of Château de Chinon, built by HenryII in the mid-12thcentury on a promontory overlooking a town.|$|E
5|$|Convention {{programming}} includes presentations, panels, {{workshops and}} tutorials on anthropomorphic culture, from literature, fiction and art to science, technology and spirituality.

In diving accidents it <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications. Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and first aid and recognition of symptoms of diving disorders are important parts of diver education.|$|E

5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to be {{surrounded}} by a healthy quantity of bone.

5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E
5|$|Most {{churches in}} the {{prosperity}} movement are non-denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks.

Critics, including Sarah Posner and Joe Conason, maintain that prosperity teachers cultivate authoritarian organizations. They argue that leaders attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority. Jenkins contends that prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of pastors.|$|E
