5000|$|Previous to its {{junction}} {{with the}} frontal vein, it sends through the supraorbital notch into the orbit a branch which communicates with the ophthalmic vein; as this vessel {{passes through the}} notch, it receives the frontal <b>diploic</b> <b>vein</b> through a [...] {{at the bottom of}} the notch.|$|E
40|$|The {{course of}} the frontal <b>diploic</b> <b>vein</b> in the mole Talpa and the tree shrew Tupaia is {{described}} and compared to the frontal <b>diploic</b> <b>vein</b> of other mammals. The frontal <b>diploic</b> <b>vein</b> in Talpa and Tupaia connects the dorsal sagittal sinus to the veins of the orbit and has an emissary function. In certain other mammals it has a diploic function and may drain towards the orbit (e. g., Orycteropus) or towards the dorsal sagittal sinus (e. g., Didelphis). The frontal <b>diploic</b> <b>vein</b> of these mammals is not homologous to the vein of the human foramen caecum, but to the human frontal <b>diploic</b> <b>vein.</b> The vein of the formen caecum is a problematic structure: its incidence in embryos and children is not clear...|$|E
50|$|The <b>diploic</b> <b>veins</b> are large, {{thin-walled}} valveless veins that {{channel in}} the diploë between {{the inner and}} outer layers of the cortical bone in the skull. They are lined by a single layer of endothelium supported by elastic tissue. They develop fully by the age of two years. The <b>diploic</b> <b>veins</b> drain this area into the dural venous sinuses. The four major types of <b>diploic</b> <b>veins</b> found {{on each side of the}} head are frontal, anterior temporal, posterior temporal, and occipital <b>diploic</b> <b>veins.</b>|$|R

30|$|The diploic venous {{system is}} {{connected}} with both the intra- and extracranial venous systems via the dural sinuses and the emissary veins, respectively. It is involved in various vascular anomalies. Although its occurrence is rare, abnormal arteriovenous shunts to the <b>diploic</b> <b>vein</b> can be lethal. For instance, dural arteriovenous fistulas can cause intracerebral hemorrhage (Yako et al. 2016) and subdural hematoma (Rivera-Lara et al. 2015). Scalp arteriovenous malformation, which causes scalp swelling, headache, and recurrent bleeding (Chowdhury et al. 2013), can also drain to the <b>diploic</b> <b>vein</b> (Bekelis et al. 2011). On the other hand, the most common diploic venous anomaly is sinus pericranii. It is considered as an abnormal communication between the intra- and extracranial venous systems (Sakai et al. 1997) and typically presents as a soft scalp swelling. In some cases, this is accompanied by local pain, headache, nausea, and vertigo (Akram et al. 2012). In regards to other venous anomalies, {{there have been reports}} of cases of subepicranial varix with connections to diploic veins, but these varices had no connections to intracranial venous sinuses (Asano et al. 2000; Mori et al. 1976).|$|E

A 46 -year-old woman presented with headache and right pulsatile tinnitus for three weeks. The tinnitus started after yelling. Digital subtraction angiography revealed DAVF within the basal portion of right parietal bone along the middle meningeal artery (MMA) groove. The fistula was fed by frontal branch of right MMA and drained into right transverse sigmoid sinus junction through dilated middle meningeal vein. The intraosseous DAVF involving <b>diploic</b> <b>vein</b> was successfully obliterated with Onyx embolization via transarterial route...|$|E

30|$|Vascular {{anomalies}} accompanied {{with the}} <b>diploic</b> <b>veins</b> are rare. Among them, sinus pericranii, which {{is characterized by}} abnormal connections between intra- and extracranial venous systems, is relatively common. Besides sinus pericranii, a few cases of subepicranial varix with connections to <b>diploic</b> <b>veins</b> have been reported, but these varices had no connections to intracranial venous sinuses. Herein, we present a rare case of an expanding venous sac in the diploe which communicated with the intracranial sinus {{but not with the}} extracranial venous systems.|$|R
5000|$|The sigmoid sinus {{receives}} {{blood from}} the transverse sinuses, which receive {{blood from the}} posterior aspect of the skull. Along its course, the sigmoid sinus also receives blood from the cerebral <b>veins,</b> cerebellar <b>veins,</b> <b>diploic</b> <b>veins,</b> and emissary veins.|$|R
30|$|The diploic venous {{system is}} located between two compact tables of the skull. It {{communicates}} with the dural sinuses and pachymeningeal veins along the inner table, {{and with the}} pericranial veins on the outer table via the emissary veins (Hershkovitz et al. 1999). The <b>diploic</b> <b>vein</b> can be involved in various vascular anomalies although they are rare. Among these vascular anomalies, sinus pericranii is relatively common (Akram et al. 2012). Sinus pericranii typically presents as a soft swelling in the scalp which enlarges and deflates in response to increase and decrease in the intracranial pressure, respectively. It is characterized by abnormal connections between intra- and extracranial venous systems (Akram et al. 2012). Here in our report, we present a rare case of an expanding venous sac in the diploe that resembled sinus pericranii but did not communicate with the pericranial veins of the scalp. We also discuss the pathology of sinus pericranii.|$|E
5000|$|The veins anastomose {{frequently}} {{with each other}} and enter the <b>diploic</b> <b>veins</b> of the skull bones and the dural sinuses. This is an extra difficulty as the vein pattern differs. The scalp veins accompany the arteries and have similar names: ...|$|R
30|$|An adult woman {{presented}} {{to us with}} a minor transient headache. Although no abnormal appearances were found on her scalp, imaging studies showed a club-shaped venous sac in the left parietal diploe that communicated with the superior sagittal sinus and <b>diploic</b> <b>veins</b> on the medial and lateral sides, respectively. It was revealed that the lesion had expanded as compared with a previous computed tomography image. Surgery was performed to intercept venous supply from the <b>diploic</b> <b>veins,</b> and the lesion was filled with thrombi. In a follow-up of 15  months, there was no recurrence of abnormal venous flow. Histological examination showed the endothelial lining in the membranous wall of the sac, which is typically observed in sinus pericranii. However, no communication with the pericranial veins of the scalp was identified on the imaging studies and intraoperative observation. Accordingly, it was diagnosed as another entity “intradiploic varix”.|$|R
50|$|Most {{bones of}} the {{calvaria}} consist of internal and external tables or layers of compact bone, separated by diploë. The diploë is cancellous bone containing red bone marrow during life, through which run canals formed by <b>diploic</b> <b>veins.</b> The diploë in a dried calvaria is not red becausethe protein was removed during preparation of the cranium. The internal table of bone is thinner than the external table, and in some areas {{there is only a}} thin plate of compact bone with no diploë.|$|R
50|$|Sinus pericranii is a venous anomaly where a {{communication}} between the intracranial dural sinuses and dilated epicranial venous structures exists. That venous anomaly {{is a collection of}} nonmuscular venous blood vessels adhering tightly to the outer surface of the skull and directly communicating with intracranial venous sinuses through <b>diploic</b> <b>veins.</b> The venous collections receive blood from and drain into the intracranial venous sinuses. The varicosities are intimately associated with the periostium, are distensible, and vary in size when changes in intracranial pressure occur.|$|R
30|$|The {{patient in}} this case report also had a varix-like venous sac in the diploe that was {{continuous}} with the <b>diploic</b> <b>veins,</b> but it was covered by the outer table of the skull and isolated from the extracranial structures. Because of this distinct lack of communications with the extracranial venous system, it belonged to neither sinus pericranii nor subepicranial varix. Accordingly, it was diagnosed as another entity of venous anomaly that should be termed “intradiploic varix”. This entity has not reported previously maybe because it should be asymptomatic in general.|$|R
50|$|Pott's puffy tumor, first {{described}} by Sir Percivall Pott in 1760, {{is a rare}} clinical entity characterized by subperiosteal abscess associated with osteomyelitis. It is characterized by an osteomyelitis of the frontal bone, either direct or through haematogenic spread. This results in a swelling on the forehead, hence the name. The infection can also spread inwards, leading to an intracranial abscess. Pott's puffy tumor {{can be associated with}} cortical vein thrombosis, epidural abscess, subdural empyema, and brain abscess. The cause of vein thrombosis is explained by venous drainage of the frontal sinus, which occurs through <b>diploic</b> <b>veins,</b> which communicate with the dural venous plexus; septic thrombi can potentially evolve from foci within the frontal sinus and propagate through this venous system. This type of chronic osteomyelitis of the frontal bone is confused with acute sub-periosteal abscess of the frontal bone, which presents as a discrete collection over the frontal sinus.|$|R
30|$|The patient {{opted for}} {{surgical}} treatment. During surgery, {{a portion of}} the skull that was assumed to be on the lesion was exposed via a linear skin incision. Neither substantial changes nor deficits were found on the skull surface, but a part of the surface that was located around the lateral end of the lesion contained a reddish-blue tinge, suggesting the thinning of the outer table of the skull. The bluish part of the outer table of the skull was removed to expose a membrane of a sac-like structure which was filled with liquid. The membrane was not pulsating. The sac had several communications with the <b>diploic</b> <b>veins</b> that we assumed to be feeding vessels. By interrupting these inflows, the sac deflated. A section {{at the end of the}} sac was cut out and sent for histological examination. There was copious bleeding from multiple interdiploic venous channels, and it was controlled by the bone wax. On the other hand, bleeding from the edge of the sac was not so heavy, suggesting that main feedings no longer remained. The edge was then ligated and the scalp was closed in layers.|$|R
40|$|Villi arachnoidales {{undergoes}} in {{the course}} of life changes in relation to the skull bones and sinuses. Our aim was to determine the relations of the villi arachnoidales to the skull bone and/or sinuses from the neonatal period to adults. The investigations were performed on collection of 50 disarticulated macerated skull bones from the newborn to 30 years of age and on 20 skulls from individuals in the life period from 30 to 80 years of age. Villi arachnoidales produced imprints on the skull bones in the shape of holes and/or furrows corresponding to different shape of the villi arachnoidales. These imprints appeared very early in the period when the bony sprouts of the large skull bones received a thin covering of compact bone, the future lamina vitrea. At that time villi arachnoidales had no connection with the dural sinuses but with the diploe and with the <b>diploic</b> <b>veins.</b> By agglomeration of the villi in larger and large formations, granula meningea, Pacchionian granulations, the contact to sinuses was realized by means of short channels. The structural changes of villi arachnoidales may produce thrombophlebitis and hydrocephalus externus, especially in children. The fate and the relations of the villi arachnoidales are therefore of great importance for neurologist, neurosurgeon and otorhinolaryngologist...|$|R
40|$|A new {{experimental}} {{model of}} cerebral venous occlusion {{was developed and}} the cerebral hemodynamics and water content using this model were studied. An anatomical study of the cerebral venous system using methacyrl resin showed that the venous system was composed of superficial and deep veins. The superficial veins drained into the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). The SSS was connected to internal and external jugular veins via the transverse sinuses and <b>diploic</b> <b>veins</b> (DV), respectively. The cats were divided into three groups {{on the basis of}} the occlusion sites as follows; Group I : SSS occlusion, Group II : DV occlusion, Group III : occlusion of both the SSS and DV. Intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral blood volume (CBV, photoelectric method) were monitored continuously. Local cerebral blood flow (1 -CBF) and water content were measured by hydrogen clearance and gravimetric methods, respectively. Somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) was also recorded. Evans blue was injected intravenously to evaluate blood brain barrier permeability. There were no siginificant changes in ICP, 1 -CBF or N 1 latency of SEP after the occlusioon in Group I or II. However, in Group III, 1 -CBF decreased significantly 2 hours after the occlusion as ICP increased gradually. N 1 latency of SEP was prolonged and water content increased significantly. CBV increased immediately after the occlusion. There was no extravasated Evans blue. The increase in CBV and water content during sinus occlusion appeared to have led to intracranial hypertension and decrease of 1 -CBF, which resulted in neural dysfunction. The brain edema in this model seemed to be hydrostatic edema or cytotoxic edema...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Sinus pericranii {{is a rare}} {{vascular}} anomaly. It {{is characterized}} by abnormal communication between the extracranial and intracranial venous system, usually involving the superior sagittal sinus and occasionally the transverse sinus. Off the midline lesions are extremely rare. Multiplicity, associated venous lakes, venous angioma and lateral location are unusual and unique presentation of sinus pericranii. Case report. A case of multiple congenital off-midline sinus pericranii in the left frontotemporal and parietal region is presented. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an extracranial vascular anomaly connected with the intracranial venous system through abnormal <b>diploic</b> or emissary <b>veins.</b> The lesions were removed completely by surgery. Conclusion. Sinus pericranii is a rare vascular malformation with unique clinical and radiological features. Sinus pericranii may cause fatal complications, {{and it must be}} treated by surgical or endovascular procedures...|$|R
30|$|Selective brain cooling in {{the brain}} can be {{achieved}} via two distinct mechanisms: (1) direct surface cooling of superficial venous blood which in turn cools the blood {{in the brain}} via <b>diploic</b> and emissary <b>veins</b> to the brain and (2) precooling of arterial blood on-route to the brain by cooling venous blood in the facial and intranasal tissues and {{the surface of the}} head [26, 27]. In this study, we made use of the second mechanism by blowing cold air into the nasal cavities. Veins in the face, surface of the head, and nasal cavities drain into the cavernous sinus, a plexus of thin-walled veins, which closely intertwines with the internal carotid artery. This anatomical arrangement creates a favorable heat exchange mechanism for the transfer of heat from the warm blood in the carotid artery to the venous blood in the cavernous sinus.|$|R
