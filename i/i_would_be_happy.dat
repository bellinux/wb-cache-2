2500|$|On 11 August 2010, at {{a public}} forum Tony Abbott was asked a {{question}} about his views on {{the absence of an}} R18+ rating for video games and whether he has any policies relating to the subject. His reply was if the Coalition won the upcoming election he would be happy to examine the issue of an R18+ classification rating for video games. Although he admitted he did not know there had been a debate on the issue [...] "If what happens with video games is not roughly analogous to what happens in other areas, that seems silly," [...] he said. He added [...] "Instinctively I'm with you, and it's something I'd be happy to look at, if we are in Government," [...] finishing off with [...] "If you think there is a problem, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> to look at it."

60|$|Well, my dear, number One {{came just}} before lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic asylum man, {{with the strong}} jaw and the good forehead.

He spoke to me, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him, though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to help and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said he was a brute and would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if I could love him in time, and when I shook my head his hands trembled, and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one else. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman's heart was free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy,</b> and that If I ever wanted a friend I must count him one of my best.|$|E
