50|$|The site is {{situated}} on a west-facing slope of a shallow {{valley of the}} Cotswolds {{to the south of}} Bath and is underlain by Oolitic Limestone. The sward contains a population of the nationally rare <b>Field</b> <b>Eryngo</b> (Eryngium campestre).|$|E
50|$|These true bugs maily feed on Apiaceae, {{especially}} on parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), <b>field</b> <b>eryngo</b> (Eryngium campestre) and Peucedanum species. This species can be found, however, on spurge (Euphorbia spec.) and knapweeds (Centaurea spec.). Adults {{can be seen}} in June and July.|$|E
50|$|Eryngium campestre, {{known as}} <b>field</b> <b>eryngo,</b> is {{a species of}} Eryngium, which is used medicinally. A member of the Apiaceae family, Eryngo is a hairless, thorny perennial. The leaves are tough and stiff, whitish-green. The basal leaves are long-stalked, pinnate and spiny.The leaves of this plant are mined by the gall fly which is called Euleia heraclei.|$|E
5000|$|The {{nature park}} is habitat of diverse vegetation. Plants {{of the wood}} area are mainly Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), Oriental alder (Alnus orientalis), European {{hornbeam}} (Carpinus betulus) and Turkey oak (Quercus cerris). Shrubs present are common rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum), butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus), myrtle, (Myrtus communis), laurel (Laurus nobilis), heather (Erica arborea), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), blackberry (Rubus), pampas grass (Cortaderia selloana). Observed plants in sandy areas are species such as <b>field</b> <b>eryngo</b> (Eryngium campestre), alkanet (Alkanna tinctoria) and golden-flowered Onosma (Onosma taurica).|$|E
50|$|The sandy soils {{have been}} settled by nutrient-poor grasslands of Elijah Blue Fescue and Grey Hair-grass, the pioneer {{vegetation}} of open, sunny, sandy terrain outside littoral regions. The grasses are in places rich in colourful herbs such as Breckland Thyme (Thymus serpyllum), Sheep's-bit (Jasione montana) and Carthusian Pink (Dianthus carthusianorum). In the open areas of sandy soil {{there are also}} species of flower normally found in fields of crops and on roadsides. The vegetation is also characterised by numerous warmth-loving plants such as Viper's Bugloss (Echium vulgare), Flixweed (Descurainia sophia) and St. Lucie Cherry (Prunus mahaleb) {{as well as many}} common subcontinental species like Hoary Alison (Berteroa incana), <b>Field</b> <b>Eryngo</b> (Eryngium campestre), Field Mugwort (Artemisia campestris), Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) and Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis).The sandstone rocks themselves are lightly covered in crustose lichens.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study tracks local {{vegetation}} {{change in}} West Cornwall (South West England) within regional context, using historic herbarium (pre- 1900) and recent vegetation records (post- 1900). The focus centres on species lost {{from the region}} over the past century. For this study we used a collection of herbarium records published in 1909 (Davey’s “Flora of Cornwall”) and contemporary records from the “New Atlas of British and Irish Flora” downloaded from the National Biodiversity Network (NBN), online database. Both data sets were spatially analysed using ArcGIS in order to detect local scale species loss. Our results showed that species loss was highest in the south (11 plant species), compared to the loss from middle areas (6 plant species) and in the northern area (8 plant species) of West Cornwall. Results on species change at the local scale were different to {{the changes that are}} happening at the national scale. Loss from West Cornwall was detected for two plant species, Mountain Melick (Melica nutans) and <b>Field</b> <b>Eryngo</b> (Eryngium campestare). These key results amplify the importance of local scale research and conservation in order to protect ecosystems functioning, genetic diversity, ecosystem services and regional identity...|$|E
