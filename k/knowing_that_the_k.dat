60|$|It was {{not even}} buried in peace. It {{was about to be}} let down, in its Royal robes, into a tomb near the high altar, in {{presence}} of a great concourse of people, when a loud voice in the crowd cried out, 'This ground is mine! Upon it, stood my father's house. This King despoiled me of both ground and house to build this church. In the great name of GOD, I here forbid his body to be covered with <b>the</b> earth <b>that</b> is my right!' The priests and bishops present, knowing the speaker's right, and <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>King</b> had often denied him justice, paid him down sixty shillings for the grave. Even then, the corpse was not at rest. The tomb was too small, and they tried to force it in. It broke, a dreadful smell arose, the people hurried out into the air, and, for the third time, it was left alone.|$|R
500|$|The King's troops, led by John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey and Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, chased Lancaster to Tutbury and Kenilworth, {{capturing}} both {{towns and}} devastating {{the counties of}} Staffordshire and Derbyshire. [...] Holland, seeing the outcome of <b>the</b> battle and <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>King</b> had recently imprisoned his daughter at the Tower of London, openly acted against Lancaster. Holland's men attacked and robbed various supporters of Lancaster at Windley including Hugh de Audley and Lancaster's wife Alice de Lacy {{to the value of}} £1,000. [...] He also ordered the men raised in Cheshire to march towards Burton and prevent the escape of Lancaster's troops to the River Mersey. [...] Holland turned his troops over to <b>the</b> <b>King</b> at Derby on 13 March but was coldly received, his past alliance with Lancaster condemning him to imprisonment at Dover Castle and the loss of his estates. [...] He was beheaded by an unknown gang in 1328 and his head was given to Thomas Lancaster's brother Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster.|$|R
60|$|When <b>the</b> <b>King</b> {{set off for}} Hampton Court, {{the gentlemen}} and {{soldiers}} {{who had been with}} him followed him out of town as far as Kingston-upon-Thames; next day, Lord Digby came to them from <b>the</b> <b>King</b> at Hampton Court, in his coach and six, to inform them <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>King</b> accepted their protection. This, the Parliament said, was making war against the kingdom, and Lord Digby fled abroad. The Parliament then immediately applied themselves to getting hold of the military power of <b>the</b> country, well <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>King</b> was already trying hard to use it against them, and that he had secretly sent the Earl of Newcastle to Hull, to secure a valuable magazine of arms and gunpowder that was there. In those times, every county had its own magazines of arms and powder, for its own train-bands or militia; so, the Parliament brought in a bill claiming the right (which up to this time had belonged to <b>the</b> <b>King)</b> of appointing <b>the</b> Lord Lieutenants of counties, who commanded these train- bands; also, of having all the forts, castles, and garrisons in the kingdom, put into the hands of such governors as they, the Parliament, could confide in. It also passed a law depriving the Bishops of their votes. <b>The</b> <b>King</b> gave his assent to that bill, but would not abandon the right of appointing the Lord Lieutenants, though he said he was willing to appoint such as might be suggested to him by the Parliament. When the Earl of Pembroke asked him whether he would not give way on that question for a time, he said, 'By God! not for one hour!' and upon this he and the Parliament went to war.|$|R
