I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> like climbing the highest peak on your first climb - where do you go from there, where is the next peak?

500|$|Largely due to {{band member}} Régine Chassagne's Haitian ancestry, the band {{has tried to}} raise support and {{awareness}} for the socio-economic problems in Haiti throughout their career. The Haitian people had 15,000 dollars donated to them on November 5, 2005. On December 26, 2006, they supported Haitian charity organization Partners In Health by releasing the song [...] "Intervention" [...] on iTunes and donating the proceeds. However, they accidentally uploaded [...] "Black Wave/Bad Vibrations", the track after [...] "Intervention" [...] on Neon Bible. While the song was quickly removed once the problem was discovered, file sharers quickly circulated it on various P2P networks. On his blog, Win Butler quipped, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> sort of charming that we can send the wrong song {{to the whole world}} with a click of a mouse... Oh well." ...|$|E
500|$|Jordan meets Heer's younger sister, Mandy (Sanjana Sanghi), {{during one}} of his performances, and she asks him to help Heer - who has been {{diagnosed}} with Aplastic Anemia. Although he is initially asked to leave by Heer's mother Neena (Shernaz Patel), Jordan's presence causes Heer to recover somewhat. He starts disregarding his musical obligations as he spends more time with Heer, and soon Khatana asks Heer to persuade Jordan to attend his concerts. Heer accompanies him to a show, and the media links them as a couple, portraying her as having an affair despite being married. Heer asks Jordan to complete his tour and reunite with her once again. After JJ finishes his performances, both will have some intimate time. During this time, her condition worsens. She slowly slips into a coma and is discovered by their doctor to be pregnant; Neena and Mandy <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> because of Jordan. Mandy calls him and tells that Heer is pregnant but has gone into a coma. Jordon leaves another show right in the middle as he has done {{many times in the past}} and reaches ICU. He tries to wake her up by saying his usual funny dialogues when they meet; however, Jordan realizes that she will not survive, because she does not respond to any of his words nor emotional touches and kisses. Heer died or not it was not confirmed ...|$|E
