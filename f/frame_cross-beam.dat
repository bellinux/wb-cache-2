50|$|The {{support arm}} {{was a heavy}} steel forging {{reaching}} a few degrees forward of lateral from the front wheel support to {{as close to the}} centerline of the car as is practicable. An integral pad socketed the helical spring, whose upper end reached a high <b>frame</b> <b>cross-beam.</b> A tubular, hence lighter, steel torque arm was bolted to the support arm somewhat inboard of the wheel to permit a sufficient steering arc. It reached the frame nearly at the dashboard with a spherical rubber bearing. The upper A-arm was conventionally welded and oriented parallel to the lower one. Between it and the frame was an old-fashioned horizontal shock absorber whose two cylinders were side by side.|$|E
