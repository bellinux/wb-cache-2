You have been angry with me for everything I did for years; ever since you first spoke to me, in secret from old Giorgio, about your Linda. Husband to one and brother to the other, did you say?

40|$|At Biwako Seikei Sport College, {{about 60}} percent of {{students}} experience practice teaching to acquire a teacher's certificate every year. The {{purpose of this study}} is to obtain the data for examining and improving the contents and the method of the teacher training-related lesson in a university, or practice teaching prior to instruction by understanding the actual condition of learning and the change of a self-valuation result in student's practice teaching. 1. Actual Condition of Learning in Practice Teaching In order to discover the actual condition of a student's learning in practice teaching, a question paper investigation using the following free descriptions was conducted. (1) What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would study by practice teaching? (2) What did you notice by actually experiencing a lesson? (3) What did you master through practice teaching? (4) The subject of research after practice teaching? (5) A university lesson which was helpful for practice teaching? (6) Something you studied in a university lesson before practice teaching? (7) Comment which let the whole practice teaching pass It became clear from students' description to have studied many things in practice teaching. Moreover, in the lesson of a university, it also became clear before practice teaching. 2. About Change of Self-Evaluation Result in Practice Teaching The Self-Evaluation paper of practice teaching was distributed to students prior to instruction of practice teaching. The evaluation result was submitted after the end of practice teaching was totaled, and was considered as the data of consideration. By this study, the results have improved the contents and the method of practice teaching prior to instruction was able to be checked. However, furthermore, it became clear that it is also necessary to improve. Also in order to solve the problems pointed out by the evaluation comments from the school for practice teaching, it is necessary to do this research continuously...|$|E
40|$|What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> were doing?” Was the {{question}} {{posed by the}} conference organizers to me as the inventor and constructor of the first working Tangible Interfaces over 40 years ago. I think {{the question}} was intended to encourage {{me to talk about}} the underlying ideas and intentionality rather than describe an endless sequence of electronic bricks and that is what I shall do in this presentation. In the sixties the prevalent idea for a graphics interface was an analogue with sketching which was to somehow be understood by the computer as three dimensional form. I rebelled against this notion for reasons which I will explain in the presentation and instead came up with tangible physical three dimensional intelligent objects. I called these first prototypes “Intelligent Physical Modelling Systems” which is a really dumb name for an obvious concept. I am eternally grateful to Hiroshi Ishii for coining the term “Tangible User Interfaces” - the same idea but with a much smarter name. Another motivator was user involvement in the design process, and that led to the Generator (1979) project with Cedric Price for the world’s first intelligent building capable of organizing itself in response to the appetites of the users. The working model of that project is in MoMA. And the same motivation led to a self builders design kit (1980) for Walter Segal which facilitated self-builders to design their own houses. And indeed as the organizer’s question implied, the motivation and intentionality of these projects developed over the years in step with advancing technology. The speaker will attempt to articulate these changes with medical, psychological and educational examples. Much of this later work indeed stemming from the Media Lab where we are talking. Related topics such as “tangible thinking” and “intelligent teacups” will be introduced and the presentation will end with some speculations for the future. The presentation will be given against a background of images of early prototypes many of which have never been previously published...|$|E
