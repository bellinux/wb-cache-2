5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century the {{writings}} of Humphrey Repton (1752–1818) were highly influential in {{the return of the}} formal garden near to the house. His sons were directly involved in the restructuring of the landscape at Valleyfield, Fife. Walter Scott's dislike of the sweeping away of the old formal gardens was also influential in creating an emphasis on preservation and restoration. His ideas were taken up by John Claudius Loudon (1783–1843), the most prolific gardening author of the century in Britain, and were highly influential throughout the world. By 1850 ambitious formal gardens had been recreated at Drummond Castle, Dunrobin and Drumlandrig. New plants from around the world, often discovered and sampled by Scots, such as the rhododendron and monkey puzzle tree, meant that Victorian and Edwardian gardens were characterised by an <b>eclectic</b> <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> the formal, picturesque and gardenesque. By {{the end of the century}} the ideas of William Robinson (1838–1935), Gertrude Jekyll (1843–1932) and the Edinburgh-based Frances Hope (d. 1880), arguing for informal flower-based gardens, had begun to dominate. They resulted in a revival of the seventeenth-century mixed flower and kitchen garden, as carried out at Kellie Castle, and Earlshall, Fife by Robert Lorimer.|$|E

5|$|Novelist {{and social}} {{commentator}} Walter Besant proposed a 'Palace of Delight' with concert halls, reading rooms, picture galleries, an art school and various classes, social rooms and frequent fêtes and dances. This {{coincided with a}} project by the philanthropist businessman, Edmund Hay Currie {{to use the money}} from the winding up of the 'Beaumont Trust', together with subscriptions to build a 'People's Palace' in the East End. Five acres of land were secured on the Mile End Road, and the Queen's Hall was opened by Queen Victoria on 14 May 1887. The complex was completed with a library, swimming pool, gymnasium and winter garden, by 1892, providing an <b>eclectic</b> <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> populist entertainment and education. A peak of 8000 'tickets' were sold for classes in 1892, and by 1900, a Bachelor of Science degree awarded by the University of London was introduced. In 1931, the building was destroyed by fire, but the Draper's Company, major donors to the original scheme, invested more to rebuild the technical college and create Queen Mary's College in December 1934. A new 'People's Palace' was constructed, in 1937, by the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, in St Helen's Terrace. This finally closed in 1954.|$|E

50|$|Steele {{had served}} {{in the office of the}} famous Chicago {{architect}} Louis Sullivan (1856-1924) prior to settling in Sioux City in 1904. Sullivan criticized the then-dominant styles of architecture based on historical revivals or <b>eclectic</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>of</b> historical features, championing instead progressive architecture based on concepts such as elimination of historical styles, simplification, functional and “true” expression of a building’s purpose, embrace of new technology, and the frank use of materials without disguise. Another of Sullivan's protégés, Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959), was inspired by Sullivan to pioneer the Prairie Style of architecture at the turn of the 20th Century. However, Steele had been relatively unsuccessful in interesting clients in the Sioux City area in his progressive ideas about architecture, although he had designed a number of mildly progressive American Craftsman bungalows and the Davidson Building (Sioux City, 1912-1913), a Sullivanesque office block.|$|R
