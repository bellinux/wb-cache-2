5|$|Unlike many celebrities Sheldon has met, James Earl Jones welcomes his company, {{and the two}} {{spend the}} night doing various activities; they go to an ice-cream parlor, a carnival, a strip club, and a sauna. Sheldon asks Jones {{questions}} about himself and he confirms that he was functionally mute for eight years, he was a pre-med in college, and that sound designer Ben Burtt used scuba equipment to create the sound of Darth Vader's breathing. They also sing at a karaoke club and prank Carrie Fisher by knocking on <b>her</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> running away.

5|$|An {{employee}} named Nasir (Haaz Sleiman) {{has taken}} explicit {{photos of the}} two, and Amira’s father will disown her if the father finds out. Veronica goes to a photo-developing store and retrieves the photos, but one is stuck in the printer and Nasir gets it. Amira’s father shows up at <b>her</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> angrily berates her and fires Veronica, although she says that her real employer is his wife. Keith catches Wallace and Piz, out for {{a night on the}} town, in a bar, discovering that they have high-quality fake IDs from Veronica, leading Keith to reprimand her. Veronica discovers the true vandal after tracking a piece of bait. The vandal’s name is Derrick (Cole Williams), who vandalized after seeing Nasir distributing a piece of anti-American propaganda at a mall. Both owners want to meet Derrick before pressing charges. Keith sends Piz (Chris Lowell) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) with clearly fake IDs into a bar as a test of his subordinates. He finds that the deputy does not check closely and resents Keith as well. Due to this fact, Keith fires the people who disobeyed his orders.|$|E
50|$|As of 2007 most {{houses have}} burglar bars, {{and many have}} placed cameras {{at the corners of}} their houses. One woman {{installed}} motion sensors, rigged <b>her</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows, and booby trapped her backyard gate.|$|R
60|$|And so his Majesty flung out, seeking Katte; and vanished: Wilhelmina saw {{no more of}} him {{for about}} a year after; being ordered to her room, and kept {{prisoner}} there on low diet, with sentries guarding <b>her</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> no outlook but the worst horror her imagination pleased to paint.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I haven't closed this door, either,' he said. She walked swiftly {{across the}} room, <b>and</b> closed <b>her</b> <b>door,</b> softly, <b>and</b> locked it. Then she came back.|$|R
5|$|In June 2013, Dimitri {{received}} an Email from his old friend, and former lover, Brooke English. Brooke {{was shocked when}} Dimitri responded by showing up at <b>her</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> {{told him that she}} thought she'd never see him again. Dimitri revealed that he and Alex had divorced, and that he had not bothered remaining in touch with Edmund's family and had reverted to his reclusive ways, but that Europe was beginning to bore him and her timing couldn't have been better. Upon returning to town, he stopped by his former residence, Wildwind, only to find that the place was empty. Brooke explained that after its last occupant, Caleb Cortlandt, had moved out, Sam and Maddie, Edmund's children, had not bothered to rent the mansion out again. Dimitri told Brooke that, while at Wildwind, he stopped by the mausoleum and made amends to Edmund, who had died in a fire 8 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|In September 1858, the Brazier family accused Mrs Mole, a labourer's {{wife who}} lived in East Thorpe, Essex, of bewitching their {{daughter}} and livestock. Hoping to have the bewitchment removed, they consulted a local cunning-man known as Burrell, who lived at nearby Copford. When Burrell was unable to help, they proceeded to consult Murrell, inviting {{him to come to}} East Thorpe to remove the curse. Murrell's planned visit generated much anticipation in East Thorpe's community, with the local rector attempting to calm the situation by requesting that the parish relieving officer move the allegedly bewitched girl to the union-house, where she could be examined by the parish surgeon. Nevertheless, the officer of the poor refused to comply, asserting that Murrell's arrival would correct the problem. Persisting, the rector applied to the local magistrate to ensure that police would be in the village on the day of Murrell's arrival, to ensure that the crowd would be controlled. On the day itself, a crowd of two hundred had gathered, and proceeded to Mrs Mole's house with the intention of carrying out folk justice; concerned by this illegal behaviour, the rector stood outside of <b>her</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> forbade the crowd entry, prior to police arriving and dispersing the mob.|$|E
25|$|The {{apartment}} where Bembenek and Fred Schultz lived shared drainage with another apartment. In the shared drainpipe was found a brownish-red wig which matched {{some of the}} hairs found on the victim's body. The woman who occupied the other apartment testified that Judy Zess had knocked on <b>her</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> asked to use her bathroom; after Zess used the woman's bathroom, the plumbing was mysteriously clogged. Zess had also admitted to owning a brownish-red wig.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day, Mr. Funk, {{a friend}} of her late husband, appears at <b>her</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> pressures Hilde to join the Retiree's Union. She joins because Anton {{had been a member}} of the Austrian Socialist Party and he would have approved of her socializing with other members. Hilde assures Mr. Funk that she will attend the next evening social. Mr. Funk's visit forces another memory to resurface. She remembers her daughter asking what party Anton had belonged to during the period of National Socialism; Hilde recalled him being part of the Hitler Youth. The reader also discovers that Hilde's brother, Hannes, was killed by the Nazi Party. Erika's insolence upsets Hilde greatly.|$|E
25|$|Carrie, her {{obsession}} with the case renewed, ransacks Fatima's apartment and comes out with a satchel full of documents. After a pursuit by a Lebanese mob, Saul finds a hidden compartment in the satchel that it contains a memory card with Brody confessing to the aborted State Department bombing. When the mission is over, however, she realizes that {{she will not be}} permitted back into the CIA, and attempts suicide by overdosing on her medication. At the last minute, she changes her mind and vomits up the pills. Moments later, Saul shows up at <b>her</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> shows her Brody's confession.

During the meeting, Carrie intuits that he is on to her and blows her cover by confronting Brody about his treason, forcing Saul and Quinn to arrest him.|$|E
25|$|In the anime, a Mr. Mime {{lives with}} Delia Ketchum. He does {{housework}} {{for her in}} exchange for room and board. Ash dressed as a Mr. Mime to inspire a real Mr. Mime who worked for a circus. Delia knew about this, so when a wild Mr. Mime came to <b>her</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> wanted lunch, {{she thought it was}} Ash in costume, and provided it with food. When the real Ash showed up, still in costume, she was quite puzzled, but wound up keeping Mimey as her live-in maid. It will only listen to Delia, and if anyone else, even Ash, gives it orders, or asks it to do something, it will normally ignore them. It is unknown if Delia has actually captured Mimey, as she is never shown with its Poké Ball. When Ash and his friends returned to Pallet Town following the Orange Islands saga, it was revealed that Brock and Mimey had become rather competitive regarding household tasks while {{the two of them were}} sharing the house with Delia.|$|E

Lhermitte attacked Yasmin from behind as she entered the office, but Yasmin was able to dodge the knife by diving to the ground. After a struggle in which Yasmin suffered multiple stab wounds, Lhermitte stabbed her in the back and slashed her throat. With her children dead, Lhermitte then attempted to kill herself by falling on her knife. When she realized that the wound would not be fatal, she wrote [...] "call the police" [...] in red marker on <b>her</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> called emergency services to the house.

500|$|In {{order to}} prove his innocence to Veronica, Troy says that he left his name and number in Stacy's room, arguing that a rapist {{would not have done}} such a thing. Veronica checks Stacy's room and finds Troy's name half-erased. Stacy {{receives}} a box of someone else's hair outside <b>her</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> Veronica deduces that there have probably been other victims of the rapist, so she goes looking for someone who bought a wig recently, finding no one.
