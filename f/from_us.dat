5|$|What is now MD222 was {{originally}} designated MD268. MD 268 {{was replaced by}} a southern extension of US 222 <b>from</b> <b>US</b> 1 at Conowingo to US 40 (now MD 7) in Perryville in 1938. The Susquehanna River Road section of US 222 was transferred from state to county maintenance through a May 8, 1958, road transfer agreement. However, that section was returned to state control through an August 23, 1961, agreement after Cecil County requested it be returned to the state. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved rolling back {{the southern end of the}} US 222 designation <b>from</b> <b>US</b> 40 to US 1 at their April 1995 spring meeting. The Maryland State Highway Administration proposed and AASHTO approved the redesignation of US 222 to MD 222 <b>from</b> <b>US</b> 40 to US 1 in February 1996; however, the new designation had already been enacted officially and marked publicly in 1995. The redesignation did not apply to Aiken Avenue; indeed, Aiken Avenue's designation was changed <b>from</b> <b>US</b> 222 to MD 222 in 1972.|$|E
5|$|A metal-surfaced road <b>from</b> <b>US</b> 20 in Rushville {{to north}} of the Niobrara River was {{constructed}} between 1940 and 1948. It was extended south to north of Cravath Lake by 1953. The road {{was removed from the}} highway system map in 1957, and was re-added in 1960, as N-250. A narrow road was extended from N-250 to N-2 around 1981â€“82, but it was not part of N-250 until 1996. The routing has not changed significantly since.|$|E

5|$|A road <b>from</b> <b>US</b> 82 to MS 1 was {{constructed}} during 1940, and opened in 1941. The road was unsigned, and was already paved in concrete. It was designated as MS 454 by 1953. By 1999, US 278 became concurrent with US 82 through MS 454's western terminus. A bypass around Greenville has been planned in the 1990s, and construction began in 2008. It was partially built before funding stopped. A bridge for MS 454's future alignment has been built, with no roads connecting to it.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Japanese in the Battle of Sattelberg, Australian Army forces broke through the Japanese {{positions}} around Finschhafen. Constant pressure <b>from</b> <b>US</b> Navy PT boats, Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the Japanese logistical system to the brink of collapse, resulting in disease, malnutrition and privation for the Japanese soldiers. Meanwhile, the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate, particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea.|$|E

5|$|An initial {{attack on}} the city was called off after the Iraqi {{occupants}} opened up with heavy fire, prompting the Saudis to reinforce the 7th Battalion with two more companies from adjacent Saudi units. The attempt to retake the city had been preceded by a 15-minute preparatory fire <b>from</b> <b>U.S.</b> Marine artillery. However Iraqi fire did manage to destroy one Saudi V-150 armored personnel carrier.|$|E
5|$|Another study {{focusing}} on the Gulf of Mexico, using a mix of data <b>from</b> <b>US</b> pelagic longline surveys from the mid-1950s and observations from the late-1990s, estimated a decline in numbers in this location of 99.3% over this period. However, changes in fishing practices and data collection methods complicate estimates.|$|E

5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a {{globular}} cluster are at approximately the same distance <b>from</b> <b>us,</b> their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E
