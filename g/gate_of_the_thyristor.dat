50|$|When a {{turn-off}} {{negative voltage}} signal {{is applied to}} the MOSFET connected to the cathode, it turns off and transfers all the current away from the cathode (N-emitter of the NPN transistor in the thyristor) into the base gate via MOSFET connected to the <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thyristor.</b> This stops regenerative latching process and results in a fast turn-off. Both the MOSFET connected to the cathode and MOSFET connected to the <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thyristor</b> are not subjected to high-voltage stresses irrespective of the magnitude of the voltage on the ETO, due to the internal structure of the thyristor containing a P-N junction. The drawback of connecting a MOSFET in series is that it has to carry the main thyristor current and it also increases the total voltage drop by about 0.3 to 0.5V and its corresponding losses. Similar to a GTO, the ETO has a long turn-off tail of current {{at the end of the}} turn-off and the next turn-on must wait until the residual charge on the anode side is dissipated through the recombination process.|$|E

The input voltage for these two half-wave converters are 180 {degrees} apart. The two full-wave converters are connected in parallel through a third interphase transformer.
