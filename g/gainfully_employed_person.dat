40|$|Based on West German {{data of the}} Socio-economic Panel (SOEP), the {{job entry}} of Dual System leavers is analyzed. All those are {{selected}} who successfully completed the Dual System {{during the period from}} 1984 - 1992. A short time after finishing their apprenticeship, every sixth <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> is working overqualified, i. e. at an inadequate job. Half of them are working in jobs which need absolutely no qualification. The number of persons working in inadequate positions exceeds the number of unemployed persons. The selection process leading to those jobs is influenced by labour market circumstances as well as by personal characteristics. Transitions from inadequate to adequate work within a period of one year are rare; the corresponding transition rate for unemployed persons is even higher. The starting wages in inadequate work are higher than those received in adequate jobs; however, the wage difference is compensated in just one year by much higher wage growth rates of those people working continually in adequate jobs.

30|$|To {{calculate}} the average actual hours worked and {{the volume of}} work, the number of <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed</b> <b>persons</b> is calculated and their structure is considered. The number of <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed</b> <b>persons</b> comprises employees subject to social insurance contributions, marginally <b>employed</b> <b>persons,</b> civil servants, and persons in work opportunities (Personen in Arbeitsgelegenheiten, so-called One-Euro-Jobs) as well as self-employed persons and family workers (for further details see Appendix B). The quarterly and annual figures stem from the Employment Accounts (cf. Lüken 2012). As there is no specific subdivision in the Employment Accounts according to working time, one fundamental element of the AZR is the allocation of employees into part-time or full-time employees. For calculating the part-time rate, different statistics are combined in the AZR.|$|R

30|$|It is {{also likely}} that the {{structure}} of the wage data plays a role in this case. The wage data of <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed</b> <b>persons</b> and the legal censorship in the upper income range probably do not represent an ideal measurement, particularly with regard to the OF of ‘managing directors, auditors, management consultants’ and ‘legal occupations’. In the case of ‘health-care occupations not requiring a medical practice license’, for example, which also show a higher proportion of self-employed persons and a higher income, no positive elasticities can be demonstrated. Nevertheless, because of the absence of a more exact database, it seems appropriate to use the elasticities as given in Table  4 for the baseline projection.|$|R
30|$|Official data on {{hours worked}} in Germany are {{provided}} by the Working Time Measurement Concept (Arbeitszeitrechnung, AZR) of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). The AZR is the key data product on working time in Germany and underlies the German national accounts figure on labour input. The two key indicators provided by the AZR are the hours worked per <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> and the labour volume, which {{is the product of}} hours worked per <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> and the number of persons in employment (Reyher and Kohler 1986; Kohler and Reyher 1988). 1 Because the AZR is based on a componentwise accounting system, changes in working hours due to collective agreements and economic fluctuations are brought together with shifts in employment structure and produce a differentiated picture of the scope, structure and development of the annual working time of <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed</b> <b>persons.</b> The results of the AZR on hours worked and the labour volume offer a unique basis for the evaluation of labour market developments and further perspectives.|$|R

It is {{the main source of}} information for the population structure with regard to age, sex, qualification level, employment status and training occupation (Maier and Helmrich 2012). It also provides data on the distribution of <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed</b> <b>persons</b> over industries and exercised occupations for the years 2005 to 2011 and can, therefore, also be used to analyse occupational switches. Furthermore, it contains data on self-employed and civil servants. No other survey delivers a more complete picture for all these characteristics.|$|R

Their instruments for capturing job tasks conceptually draw on comparable instruments from the German Microcensus (Henninges et al. 1977), which however only refer to a respondent’s main job task (and hence are not a good data source for analyses {{in the tradition of}} the Task-Based Approach). All datasets have sample sizes between 20, 000 and 30, 000 respondents. Data for the earlier studies until 1998 / 99 were collected jointly by the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (Bundesinstitut für Berufsbildung/BIBB) and the Institute for Employment Research (Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung/IAB). Data for the later studies were collected by the BIBB and the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (Bundesanstalt für Arbeitsschutz und Arbeitsmedizin/BAuA).

Summary: That {{opportunities}} for <b>gainfully</b> <b>employing</b> <b>persons</b> with severe mental illness should be maximized is a position around which there is virtual unanimity. But identifying obstacles to this goal and ways to overcome them is another matter – one that, in different forms, has engaged members {{of a number of}} disciplines. In this volume we bring together diverse disciplinary perspectives from psychology, psychiatry, statistics, occupational therapy and psychiatric rehabilitation research, sociology and labor economics to discuss a range of topics related to employment and mental illness. The papers included here span a range of domains, from “person – level” questions of person-environment fit to the broad societal effects of labor markets. Evaluative perspectives on various approaches that the mental health community has taken in seeking to advance the employment of persons with serious mental illness are also examined. While we will not claim to have represented every perspective currently in play in research on employment for persons with mental illness, we feel this volume represents the multi-disciplinary flavor of the small but growing research establishment in this area.

40|$|Background: Agricultural {{workers are}} exposed to organic dust {{containing}} endotoxins, mites, and moulds. Aims: To compare the occurrence of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) among male and female livestock and agricultural workers with <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed</b> {{men and women in}} Sweden. Methods: Male and female livestock and agricultural workers were identified in the Swedish National Censuses of 1970 and 1990 and were followed until the end of 1995. The IHD mortality among the livestock and agricultural workers was compared with that of <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed</b> men and women. Information of smoking habits was gathered from a previous national survey. Results: Male as well as female livestock workers had slightly higher standardised mortality ratios (SMR) regarding IHD compared with all <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed</b> men and women in Sweden. The SMR for male workers was 1. 06 (95 % CI 0. 95 to 1. 18). The SMR for female workers was 1. 10 (95 % CI 0. 98 to 1. 23). Agricultural workers had lower SMRs. Adjustments for smoking habits would further increase the SMRs by about 9 % in male workers and about 5 % in female workers. Conclusion: The present data suggest a slightly increased risk for IHD among both male and female livestock workers, which {{may be the result of}} organic dust exposure...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: This study {{intends to}} {{contribute}} to a research tradition that asks how causal attributions of illnesses affect coping behavior. Causal attributions are understood as the most important element of illness representations and coping as a means to preserve quality of life. The issue is applied to a condition so far often neglected in research on illness representations-back pain-and a third concept is added to the picture: culture. AIM: The aim of this study is (a) to explore the causal factors to which persons with back pain attribute the further course of their illness, (b) to find out whether the attributed causes are predictors of coping maxims, and (c) to find out whether cultural factors affect attributions and coping and moderate the relationship between the two. METHODS: A total of 1259 <b>gainfully</b> <b>employed</b> or self-employed <b>persons</b> with recent episodes of back pain were recruited in the three language regions of Switzerland. They were asked to complete a structured online interview, measuring among many other variables attributed causes, coping maxims, and affiliation to one of the Swiss micro-cultures (German-, French- or Italian-speaking). RESULTS: Attributed causes of the illness that can be influenced by a patient go along with more active coping styles. Cultural affiliation impacts on coping maxims independently, but culture moderates the relationship of attributed causes and coping maxims only in two of twenty possible cases. IMPLICATIONS: The results show that cultural differences can be analytically incorporated in the models of illness representations. Results may help to improve healthcare providers' communication with patients and plan public health campaigns. The approach to micro-cultural differences and the substantive relationships between alterability of causes and activity in coping may help the further development of models of illness representations...|$|R
