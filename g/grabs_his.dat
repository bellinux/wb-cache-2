5|$|The {{fourth and}} final entry in the Uncharted series, , was showcased at E3 2014, during Sony's press conference. A trailer {{features}} a wounded Drake washing ashore an island. He rises, <b>grabs</b> <b>his</b> gun, and checks its ammo before walking into a jungle-like area, as the camera pans to show hanging cages with skeletons inside. The trailer also features a conversation between Drake and Sully, where Drake asks for Sully's help, having seemingly just laid out a plan. Sully warns Nate against it, but Nate responds {{that he has no}} choice, and asks if he can count on Sully one last time, who confirms that he can. A Thief's End takes place three years after the events of Drake's Deception. Drake has retired from fortune hunting, and is seemingly still married to Elena, as he still wears his ring in the trailer, but is dragged back into the profession by his thought dead older brother, Sam Drake (voiced by Troy Baker), after the latter discovers a lead to the semi-mythical anarchist colony of Libertalia and with it, the possible location of the treasure stolen by the legendary pirate captain Henry Avery.|$|E

When Debelzaq comes to relieve him of the watch, Johann says how much she remind him of his dead daughter, {{then goes on to}} speak of the {{politics}} of her trial, and how the Church cannot have her not be guilty. Johann decides to give up the mission and goes to convince the others to do the same, leaving Anna alone with Debelzaq. Anna becomes hysterical at the prospect of being left alone with Debelzaq. She attacks him and <b>grabs</b> <b>his</b> key to the cage, then escapes, fleeing toward a nearby village. The search for her leads the group to a mass grave, where Eckhart has visions of his dead daughter. Chasing the visions, he impales himself on Kay's sword and dies. When they recapture her, the tearful Anna explains that she only ran away for fear of Debelzaq. However the group gradually becomes less trusting of her. They cross a rickety rope bridge, where Anna saves Kay from falling to his death by grabbing him with one hand, showing unnatural strength. The group enters the dark forest called Wormwood, where Hagamar attempts to kill Anna so that the group can go home, only to be stopped by the others.

500|$|The track {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Ken Barnes of USA Today described the song {{as being a}} [...] "hopelessly sappy ballad oozing with fuzzy sentiments. I'd say it's more like caterpillars." [...] Frank Kogan of The Village Voice, citing the lyrics, [...] "I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true/Oh baby you give me butterflies" [...] wrote [...] "so, would he give her, like, caterpillars in exchange? birds?" [...] and added that what <b>grabs</b> <b>his</b> attention about a song like [...] "Butterflies" [...] is not the [...] "melody but the weirdly ringing wrench-against-faucet clang on the backbeat." [...] Christie Leo of the New Straits Times gave the track a more positive review, calling the song a [...] "luxuriant" [...] ballad. Pop music critic Robert Hilburn, writing for the Los Angeles Times, described [...] "Butterflies", and another song from Invincible ("Speechless"), as being [...] "as woefully generic as their titles". A journalist of the same publication felt that track was about romantic [...] "jitters".|$|E
500|$|Things soon {{begin to}} fall apart for Rashad; Ant is arrested for selling weed, and later Rashad finds out the truth about Erin. He no longer speaks to his friends, realizing that Esquire knew about Erin the whole time. Esquire, feeling guilty {{about the way he}} {{obtained}} the letter, decides to return it to Garnett, and reveals the truth about himself and his background. He, Brooklyn, and Teddy attempt to make peace with Rashad and ask him to attend Skate Wars, Cascade's annual skate competition, with them; Rashad, however, refuses their offer. Just as he decides that he will go, after being persuaded by his uncle, he finds out that Marcus is looking for Ant on the streets, searching for cash that Ant owes to him. Rashad tracks the two down and throws the money that Ant owes Marcus in his face. Marcus then holds Rashad at gunpoint and makes a rude comment. Rashad knocks the gun off of Marcus's hand, it goes off, and they fight briefly until Rashad gets up to leave. Rashad tells Ant to get into the car while Marcus <b>grabs</b> <b>his</b> gun and ends up shooting Ant (later revealed) in the chest.

500|$|An X-ray machine {{scanning}} Halloween candy malfunctions {{and gives}} Bart {{the ability to}} stretch his body like rubber and Lisa super strength. They become a superhero duo, calling themselves [...] "Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl". Later, Lucy Lawless (dressed as Xena) addresses fans at a science fiction convention. Comic Book Guy, who has styled himself as a villain called [...] "The Collector", kidnaps her using a magnet to attract her metal breast plate. Lawless tries to remove the breastplate but stops after she notices that her horny nerd fans have cameras ready. The Collector takes her to his lair, where he puts her in an aluminized PET film bag for [...] "safekeeping" [...] and imprisons her in a room of other similarly-captured celebrities. Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl then enter the fray {{in an attempt to}} free Xena, but they are soon captured as well. The Collector suspends the duo over a vat of [...] "Lucite". After feigning interest in the villain, Lawless starts clobbering him. The Collector <b>grabs</b> <b>his</b> limited edition double edged lightsaber from [...] (which was released a few months before the episode) and ignites the blades, but when Lawless reminds him that he has removed it from its original packaging, he panics and ends up falling into the Lucite.

You gonna hit me with your purse?" [...] after which his friends start hitting Rook with a chair. The first obviously gay character featured by DC was Extraño, an effeminate Peruvian man whose name means [...] "strange" [...] in Spanish, created by Steve Englehart and Joe Staton, and appeared in Millennium and New Guardians in 1987. New Guardians was not successful, but during its short run it also featured one team member, Jet, contracting AIDS. The series was controversial, as several characters on the team were infected with HIV through the scratch of a character called the Hemo-Goblin. Many angry letters were printed in response to this misinformation about HIV transmission, along with some gay readers complaining that Extraño was too stereotypical. An official aftermath to Millennium, The Spectre (vol. 2) #11, depicted a [...] "mostly male and mostly gay" [...] AIDS rally. Several characters, including the Enchantress (describing them as [...] "filthy disgusting men") and a police helicopter pilot named Ed (screaming about [...] "fags") are influenced into attempting to crush the rally by a seven-headed spirit. Thanks to the actions of the Spectre, Doctor Fate, Deadman, Madame Xanadu (later herself revealed to be bisexual), and Ben Turner, the men are saved.|$|E

He {{attempts}} to give her some [...] "happy dust" [...] despite her claims that she's given up drugs, but Porgy <b>grabs</b> <b>his</b> arm and scares him off. Sportin' Life leaves, reminding Bess as he goes that her men friends come and go, but he will be there all along. Bess and Porgy are now left alone, and express their {{love for each other}} ("Bess, You Is My Woman Now"). The chorus re-enters in high spirits as they prepare to leave for the picnic ("Oh, I can't sit down"). Bess is invited to the picnic by Maria, but she demurs as Porgy cannot come (due to his disability, he cannot get on the boat), but Maria insists.
