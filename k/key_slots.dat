40|$|MEMO No CFD/THERMO- 47 - 2004 Date: 4 th March 2004 Abstract: The {{effect of}} a surface {{roughness}} on heat transfer is studied in two electric-motor-related cases. A flow in a clearance and between the cooling fins of the ABB HXR 400 L electric motor is simulated numerically. The clearance is simplified to a two dimensional slot and, therefore, the calculation is not valid in {{the ends of the}} rotor. Furthermore, the clearance is modelled utilizing symmetry and only a sector of 30 ◦ is modelled. The air flow around the cooling fins is modelled by calculating one fin space and its surroundings. FINFLO flow solver, developed at Helsinki University of Technology, is used in the simulations. For the turbulence modelling k-ω model is utilized. Main result: A surface sand-roughness of 46 µm is used in a case of the clearance of an electric motor. The improvement of the equivalent conductivity is 0. 4 % with open <b>key</b> <b>slots</b> and 4 % with filled <b>key</b> <b>slots.</b> A surface roughness of 1. 5 µm has no effect on the heat transfer coefficient in a flow around the cooling fins while a roughness of 260 µm improves heat transfer coefficient by 1. 8 %...|$|E

A rotating eddy current probe has been developed in an ongoing exploratory development program for advanced NDE methods, {{which is based on}} a YIG (Yttrium Iron Garnet) ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) probe.

A laboratory breadboard signal processor system has been fabricated which converts the active FMR probe output into voltage levels corresponding to it’s frequency and amplitude. It has been demonstrated in previous work 2 that flaw and liftoff information can be generated with phase separation from the frequency and amplitude of an active FMR probe. The data presented in this paper, however, is processed only from the amplitude signal. Due to the physical restrictions put on the fabrication of the small radius active FMR probe, we were unable to achieve flaw/liftoff separation by mixing the frequency and amplitude signals as in our previous work. However, we feel that flaw/liftoff separation from the physically small probes is possible with some redesign in the oscillator circuit...|$|R
