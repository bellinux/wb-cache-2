40|$|Abstract. Programming {{multicore}} shared-memory {{systems is}} a challenging combination of exposing parallelism in your program and communicating between the resulting parallel paths of execution. The burden of communication can introduce complexity {{that is hard}} to separate from the pure expression of the algorithm and can negate the performance that is gained from parallelism. We are extending the Scala language with dataflow for creating parallelism and transactions for the controlled mutation of shared state. We take <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>look</b> at applying this work to Lee’s algorithm for routing circuit boards and consider the potential benefits of programming with this system with regard to the elegance of expression and the resulting performance. We show how our approach reduces the number of lines of code and synchronisation operations needed, {{at the same time as}} improving real-world performance. ...|$|R
