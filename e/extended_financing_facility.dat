40|$|To {{encourage}} the private funding and {{provision of infrastructure}} services, governments have used specialized <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> to offer financial support to investors, often {{in the form of}} grants, soft loans, or guarantees. The authors present case studies of infrastructure <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> in various stages of development in Colombia, India, and Pakistan. They also present case studies of government-sponsored <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> (not of infrastructure) in Argentina, and Moldova. They find that these facilities have often fallen short of their objectives for two main reasons. First, the environment was not conducive to private participation in infrastructure because of poor sector policies, an unstable macroeconomic environment, and inadequate financial sector policies, among other reasons. Second, the facility was faulty in design - in terms of sectors targeted, pricing of instruments, and consistency of objectives, and instruments.
