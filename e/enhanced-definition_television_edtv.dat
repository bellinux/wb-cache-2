5000|$|... 480p {{does not}} qualify as high-definition {{television}} (HDTV); {{it is considered}} <b>enhanced-definition</b> <b>television</b> (<b>EDTV).</b> FWVGA is only used for 854&times;480. FFmpeg uses wvga or hd480 as abbreviations for 852&times;480.|$|E
50|$|With doubled {{temporal}} resolution, 480p60 {{is considered}} <b>enhanced-definition</b> <b>television</b> (<b>EDTV).</b> It can be transported by both major digital television formats, ATSC and DVB. The frames are doubled (from either a 30 frame or 24 frame pull-down source) on broadcast (to avoid flicker) for display devices that lack {{any kind of}} frame doubling ability. Widescreen 16:9 material has only the width scaled down to fit 720 pixels instead of an unscaled 848 width.|$|E
50|$|With doubled {{temporal}} resolution, 576p50 {{is considered}} <b>enhanced-definition</b> <b>television</b> (<b>EDTV),</b> {{regardless of the}} image being scaled {{the same way as}} an interlaced frame. In some countries, such as Australia, the 576p resolution standard is technically considered high-definition and was in use by the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS TV) (16:9 the format has aspect ratio 1.468), eventually replaced by 720p for its high-definition subchannel; SBS later changed to using 1080i. The Seven Network initially used 576p for its high-definition subchannel, but now uses 1080i instead.|$|E
50|$|Plasma screens {{are made}} out of glass. This may cause glare from {{reflected}} objects in the viewing area. Currently, plasma panels cannot be economically manufactured in screen sizes smaller than 82 cm. Although a few companies {{have been able to}} make plasma <b>enhanced-definition</b> <b>televisions</b> (<b>EDTV)</b> this small, even fewer have made 32 inch plasma HDTVs. With the trend toward large-screen television technology, the 32 inch screen size is rapidly disappearing. Though considered bulky and thick compared with their LCD counterparts, some sets such as Panasonic's Z1 and Samsung's B860 series are as slim as 2.5 cm thick making them comparable to LCDs in this respect.|$|R
50|$|<b>Enhanced-definition</b> <b>television,</b> or extended-definition <b>television</b> (<b>EDTV)</b> is an American Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) {{marketing}} shorthand {{term for}} certain digital television (DTV) formats and devices. Specifically, this term defines formats that deliver a picture superior {{to that of}} standard-definition television (SDTV) but not as detailed as high-definition television (HDTV).|$|R
50|$|The console {{can supply}} video through several {{different}} accessories. The console came with A/V cables, considered {{at the time}} to be the standard for video and audio connectivity. Sega and various third parties also manufactured RF modulator connectors and S-Video cables. A VGA adapter allows Dreamcast games to be played on computer displays or <b>Enhanced-definition</b> <b>television</b> sets in 480p.|$|R
50|$|Standard-definition {{television}} (SDTV or SD) is {{a television}} system {{that uses a}} resolution that is {{not considered to be}} either high-definition television (720p, 1080i, 1080p, 1440p, 4K UHDTV, and 8K UHD) or <b>enhanced-definition</b> <b>television</b> (<b>EDTV</b> 480p). The two common SDTV signal types are 576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution, derived from the European-developed PAL and SECAM systems; and 480i based on the American National Television System Committee NTSC system. SDTV and high definition television (HDTV) are the two categories of display formats for digital television (DTV) transmissions, which are becoming the standard.|$|E
50|$|Standard-definition {{television}} or SDTV refers to two different resolutions: 576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution, {{derived from the}} European-developed PAL and SECAM systems; and 480i based on the American National Television System Committee NTSC system. SDTV is a television system that uses a resolution that is {{not considered to be}} either high-definition television (720p, 1080i, 1080p, 1440p, 4K UHDTV, and 8K UHD) or <b>enhanced-definition</b> <b>television</b> (<b>EDTV</b> 480p). In North America, digital SDTV is broadcast in the same 4:3 aspect ratio as NTSC signals with widescreen content being center cut. However, {{in other parts of the}} world that used the PAL or SECAM color systems, standard-definition television is now usually shown with a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the transition occurring between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s. Older programs with a 4:3 aspect ratio are shown in the US as 4:3 with non-ATSC countries preferring to reduce the horizontal resolution by anamorphically scaling a pillarboxed image.|$|E

40|$|Terrestrial {{broadcasting}} {{has brought}} entertainment and media information to mass audiences {{around the world}} for nearly a century. In the last two decades, the demand for consumption of multimedia services anywhere anytime has increased greatly. Because the spectrum resource is limited, a new spectrum efficient broadcasting technology is required to meet this demand. Digital broadcast technologies, such as the European Digital Video Broadcast- Terrestrial (DVB-T), moved terrestrial broadcast into the digital age. While analog broadcast can only deliver one programme per channel, digital broadcast namely DVB-T allows multi-programme broadcasting where 2 to 4 standard definition TV (SDTV) programmes can be transmitted with time division multiplexing in a single 8 MHz channel. The bandwidth of DVB-T (from 12 to 24 Mbit/s) can be allocated to offer different TV qualities, such as enhanced definition <b>television</b> (<b>EDTV,</b> re-quiring about 10 to 12 Mbit/s per programme) or high definition TV (HDTV, requiring about 24 Mbit/s per programme) [1].

50|$|The Grand Alliance (GA) was a {{consortium}} created in 1993 {{at the behest}} of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to develop the American digital <b>television</b> (SDTV, <b>EDTV)</b> and HDTV specification, with the aim of pooling the best work from different companies. It consisted of AT&T Corporation, General Instrument Corporation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Philips Consumer Electronics, David Sarnoff Research Center, Thomson Consumer Electronics, and Zenith Electronics Corporation. The Grand Alliance DTV system is the basis for the ATSC standard.|$|R
50|$|As EDTV signals {{require more}} {{bandwidth}} (due to frame doubling) than is feasible with SDTV connection standards (such as composite video, SCART or S-Video), higher bandwidth media {{must be used}} to accommodate the additional data transfer. To achieve EDTV, consumer electronic devices such as a progressive scan DVD player or modern video game consoles must be connected through at least a component video cable (typically using 3 RCA cables for video), a VGA connector, or a DVI or HDMI connector. For over-the-air <b>television</b> broadcasts, <b>EDTV</b> content uses the same connectors as HDTV.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{detection}} of shot changes {{in order to improve}} H. 264 compression efficiency. This improvement is achieved by inserting intra frames when cuts occur and coding the rest of the frames using interframe prediction. In previous works, the proposed algorithm has demonstrated to be a fast and robust method for low delay and very low bitrate video coding, based on the comparison of the number of intra-coded macroblocks with two thresholds, one fixed and the other adaptive. In this paper, the optimization of the algorithm to be applied to high quality and low delay video coding is discussed and the results with Enhanced Definition <b>Television</b> format sequences (<b>EDTV)</b> are presented. This algorithm is also compared with another recent method based on the same measure, with results favoring our approach.
