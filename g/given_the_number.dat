5|$|Alonso's {{second season}} at Real Madrid {{started with the}} arrival of a new manager, José Mourinho. He was <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> 14 jersey after the {{departure}} of vice-captain Guti. He did not score any goals that whole season but was vital. While he believed that Real Madrid would win the league, the club only managed to win the Copa del Rey.|$|E

5|$|<b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of {{navigation}} algorithms calculating simultaneously {{to provide all}} the information in real time, {{research has been conducted}} to improve the computation time of some numerical methods using field-programmable gate arrays. The research focused on visual perception. The first part was focused on the simultaneous localization and mapping with an extended Kalman filter that estimates the state of a dynamic system from a series of noisy or incomplete measures. The second focused on the location and the detection of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|In 1723, {{after taking}} up his post as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, Bach set {{the text of}} the Magnificat in a twelve {{movement}} composition in the key of E-flat major. For a performance at Christmas he inserted four hymns (laudes) related to that feast. This version, including the Christmas interpolations, was <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> BWV 243a in the catalogue of Bach's works.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Governor Ryan {{placed a}} {{moratorium}} on executions in Illinois after courts exonerated and freed 13 death row inmates who had been wrongfully convicted. Ryan also promised to review the cases of all Illinois death row inmates. <b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of cases of alleged brutality to be investigated, inmates {{who claimed to have}} been abused and gave coerced confessions were offered reduced sentences in exchange for dropping charges. A plea agreement was reached with one convicted victim. Illinois State's Attorney Devine made a broader offer to several inmates. Aaron Patterson rejected the plea deal.|$|E

5|$|On 23 August 2012, Smith {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with Cardiff City {{for an estimated}} fee of £350,000. He was <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> 14 shirt, and made his debut two days later on 25 August 2012, in a 2–4 away defeat against Bristol City. On 23 October, Smith suffered a hamstring injury against Watford, which eventually meant that he missed the remainder of 2012. His first goal for Cardiff City came on his first start after returning from his injury on 19 January, and was the winning goal in a 2–1 victory at Blackpool.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 2009, Robben {{moved to}} Bayern Munich for around €25million. He was <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> 10 shirt, last worn by his fellow Dutchman, Roy Makaay. On 9 March 2010, Robben scored the {{deciding}} goal in Bayern's 2–3 defeat (4–4 on aggregate over two legs) against Fiorentina, taking them {{through to the}} quarter-finals of the 2009–10 Champions League on away goals.|$|E
5|$|The Freedoms were {{published}} {{in a series of}} four full-color, full-page editions, each accompanied by an essay of the same title. The panels {{were published}} in successive weeks in the order corresponding to Roosevelt's speech: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6), and Freedom from Fear (March 13). For the authors of the accompanying essays, Hibbs had numerous options <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of regular contributors to The Post.|$|E
25|$|Another, easier {{equation}} {{that can}} be applied to get the correct molecular formula of the CFC/R/Freon class compounds is this to take <b>the</b> <b>numbering</b> and add 90 to it. The resulting value will <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of carbons as the first numeral, <b>the</b> second numeral <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of hydrogen atoms, and <b>the</b> third numeral <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of fluorine atoms. The rest of the unaccounted carbon bonds are occupied by chlorine atoms. The value of this equation is always a three figure number. An easy example is that of CFC-12, which gives: 90+12=102 -> 1 carbon, 0 hydrogens, 2 fluorine atoms, and hence 2 chlorine atoms resulting in CCl2F2. The main advantage of this method of deducing the molecular composition in comparison with the method described in the paragraph above is that it <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of carbon atoms of the molecule.|$|R
25|$|The contact graph of an {{arbitrary}} finite packing of unit balls is the graph whose vertices {{correspond to the}} packing elements and whose two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding two packing elements touch each other. The cardinality of the edge set of <b>the</b> contact graph <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of touching pairs, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of 3-cycles in <b>the</b> contact graph <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of touching triplets, and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of tetrahedrons in <b>the</b> contact graph <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of touching quadruples (in general for a contact graph associated with a sphere packing in n dimensions that the cardinality of the set of n-simplices in <b>the</b> contact graph <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of touching (n+1)-tuples in the sphere packing). In the case of 3-dimensional Euclidean space, non-trivial upper bounds on <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of touching pairs, triplets, and quadruples were proved by Karoly Bezdek and Samuel Reid at the University of Calgary.|$|R

5|$|The club played Warrington {{over the}} 2008 Christmas holidays, as a {{pre-season}} friendly to Wigan's 2009 season. Tomkins claimed a hat-trick {{as the team}} swept aside a young and inexperienced Warrington side 44–4. Tomkins also featured in the club's two other fixtures during the pre-season, firstly against Huddersfield and then against Leigh. For 2009, Tomkins was <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> 25 jersey.|$|E
5|$|When the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941, she {{was located in}} the Bay of Kotor along with the three other submarines of the flotilla. On 10 April, Hrabri and Osvetnik received orders for an operation against the Italian enclave of Zara on the Dalmatian coastline, but the mission did not proceed. She was later captured by the Italian XVII Corps at the Bay of Kotor. She was <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> N3 but was not commissioned and was scrapped later that year due to her poor condition.|$|E
5|$|After two {{unsuccessful}} seasons, Barcelona were {{in need of}} an overhaul, {{leading to}} the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter's departure, Messi was <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> 10 shirt. He signed a new contract in July 2008 on an annual salary of €7.8million, becoming the club's highest-paid player. Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined {{for a total of}} eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential. Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.|$|E

5|$|After {{two years}} with Inter, Baggio decided not to renew his expiring {{contract}} due to his conflicts with Marcello Lippi, making him a free agent at age 33. He was linked with smaller Serie A clubs such as Napoli and Reggina, and also several Premier League and La Liga clubs, including Barcelona. Baggio ultimately transferred to Serie A newcomers Brescia, under head coach Carlo Mazzone, aiming to save them from relegation, and staying in Italy {{in order to have}} a greater opportunity of being called up for the 2002 World Cup. He was made captain and was <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> 10 shirt, playing as an attacking midfielder.|$|E
5|$|Ben Arfa officially joined Marseille on 1 July 2008 for €12million, {{with future}} {{incentives}} {{to be included}} later, after an agreement was reached between Marseille and Lyon in a meeting organized by the Ligue de Football Professionnel. As {{a result of the}} disagreement over the transfer, in December 2008, Ben Arfa told the local Lyon newspaper Le Progrès that his former team lacked class and was not a great team. Ben Arfa was presented to the media and had his first training session with the club the same day. He was <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> 20 shirt. On 16 July, Ben Arfa was involved in another training session bust-up, this time with striker and France international Djibril Cissé. Cissé later joined English club Sunderland on loan.|$|E
5|$|For {{technical}} advice, {{the journalists}} engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles GC, a retired British Army {{officer who was}} regarded as an expert in explosives and ballistics. Styles believed {{that it would have}} been obvious to the authorities that Savage's car was unlikely to contain a bomb as the weight would have been obvious on the vehicle's springs; he also expressed his opinion that a remote detonator could not have reached the car park from the scenes of the shootings <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of buildings and other obstacles between the locations. As the government refused to comment on the shootings until the inquest, the documentary concluded by putting its evidence to a leading human rights lawyer, who expressed his belief that a judicial inquiry was necessary to establish the facts surrounding the shootings.|$|E

5|$|In 1883 Gaudí was put {{in charge}} of the {{recently}} initiated project to build a Barcelona church called Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família (Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family, or Sagrada Família). Gaudí completely changed the initial design and imbued it with his own distinctive style. From 1915 until his death he devoted himself entirely to this project. <b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of commissions he began receiving, he had to rely on his team to work on multiple projects simultaneously. His team consisted of professionals from all fields of construction. Several of the architects who worked under him became prominent in the field later on, such as Josep Maria Jujol, Joan Rubió, Cèsar Martinell, Francesc Folguera and Josep Francesc Ràfols. In 1885, Gaudí moved to rural Sant Feliu de Codines to escape the cholera epidemic that was ravaging Barcelona. He lived in Francesc Ullar's house, for whom he designed a dinner table as a sign of his gratitude.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, KKR was one {{of seven}} private equity firms {{involved}} in the buyout of SunGard in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. KKR's partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Blackstone Group, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1988. SunGard was the largest buyout of a technology company until the Blackstone-led buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction was notable <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of firms involved in the transaction, the largest club deal completed to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Warelwast's {{background}} or family before 1087. Later in life {{he was involved in}} founding Augustinian houses of canons, which– according to historian – implies that he was an Augustinian canon or spent some of his early years in a house of such canons. Several medieval chroniclers hostile to Warelwast, including Eadmer, claim that he was illiterate, but his career suggests otherwise, as it involved the extensive use of written documents. He must also have been an accomplished speaker, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of times he was used as a diplomat. He was possibly educated at Laon, where later in life he sent his nephew, Robert Warelwast, to school. Another nephew, William, became the bishop's steward.|$|E
