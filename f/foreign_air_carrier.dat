50|$|Less than a {{year after}} the December 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, the President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism {{recommended}} improvements in FAA security bulletins, leading to the creation of Security Directives and Information Circulars.

For the United States, the recent recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Provisions in the Senate's proposed postal reform legislation, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, seek to address longstanding concerns about the Department of Transportation's (DOT) role in setting transportation rates for certain segments of the U. S. Postal Service's (USPS) international mail. Specifically, these rates are what <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> charge USPS for transporting letter-class and military mail to international destinations. The methodology DOT uses to set these rates was established by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) in a rate proceeding that concluded in the late 1970 s. The transportation of this mail is subject to various statutory requirements, such as having DOT set the rates that USPS is to pay to U. S. <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> for transporting international mail and a duty to carry provision that requires the <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> to provide facilities and services for transporting this mail. DOT, USPS, and U. S. <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> have raised concerns about the current rate process, particularly because the rate-setting methodology has not been comprehensively updated since the late 1970 s. Some stakeholders view the current rate-setting process as an anachronism in today's increasingly deregulated international mail and transportation marketplace. USPS has stated that this system results in excessive rates, which negatively affects its financial position and impedes its ability {{to compete in the}} international postal marketplace. Some U. S. passenger carriers, however, are concerned that eliminating the current system would exacerbate their existing financial difficulties. Although the stakeholders made efforts over the past year to improve the current rate-setting process, they were not able to reach a consensus. The proposed legislation would eliminate DOT's rate-setting authority and allow USPS to negotiate contracts with U. S. and <b>foreign</b> <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> for its international mail transportation rates and services. Therefore, {{to gain a better understanding}} of the rate-setting process and the potential impact of the provisions in the recently introduced postal reform bill related to setting rates for international mail air transportation, our objectives were to (1) describe the current process DOT uses in setting international mail air transportation rates, how the mail transportation market has changed over time, and the possible implications of these market changes for the current rate-setting process; (2) describe applicable S. 662 provisions and the key stakeholders' views of these provisions; and (3) assess these provisions against key principles of postal reform [...] flexibility, efficiency, and fairness. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{entry into}} force, on January 1 st, 2012, of the European Union Directive 2008 / 101 /EC {{extending}} the European Emission Trading System to {{domestic and international}} civil aviation has taken the dispute regarding its legitimacy to unprecedented heights. The choice of the EU legislator to include <b>foreign</b> <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> and their CO 2 emissions that occurred beyond EU airspace infuriated third countries, while {{the fact that the}} directive applies the same treatment to all airline operators whatever their nationality met vivid criticism from developing countries, in particular China and India. This paper investigates the reasons why the environmental objective pursued by the EU Aviation ETS does not seem sufficient to render its unilateral adoption acceptable to the international community, despite staging multilateral negotiations and despite the flourishing national transplants of the ETS system in other jurisdictions. Thereby it provides a preliminary assessment of what the current row implies for the global governance of climate change. Devoting particular attention to the positions of the EU and China in this dispute, it argues that the opposition to EU endeavour finds its roots in the normative frictions between the climate change regime and the international aviation regime, while the lack of process legitimacy of EU unilateralism provoked third countries’ claims to the infringement of their national sovereignty. Thus, it concludes that in the current international system, the harmonization of regimes’ normative goals and principles must result from a political choice, the absence of which can effectively frustrate the achievement of multilateral cooperation goals. Moreover, in such context, the unilateral imposition of an alternative path involving the other regime members against their consent, to palliate multilateral norm-making, is likely to meet increasingly strong opposition from an increasing number of powerful countries. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{certification}} {{and implementation of}} the Future Air Navigation System (FANS- 1) was based on the benefits of reduced separation minima, ability to optimize flight plans enroute, and the prompt transmission and reception of messages between oceanic controllers and 747 - 400 aircraft transiting the Pacific. In addition, FANS was intended to supersede High Frequency (HF) radio which has been the staple, yet problematic, long distance communication link for years. However, in the three initial years of operation, FANS has revealed its own unique operational issues. Although some technical and engineering problems have been studied and addressed, little research has been conducted on human factors issues {{associated with the use of}} FANS on the flight deck. This lack of prior data on the operational use of FANS prompted a joint NASA/Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) inquiry into FANS datalink. In addition, two <b>foreign</b> <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> and their respective safety agencies were recruited to participate. This international FANS research effort consisting of three aviation safety agencies and three international commercial air-carriers has provided a unique opportunity for conducting human factors research in an operational environment. An ASRS 'callback' format was chosen for the study as a practical and viable method for capturing FANS events on the flight deck. Initially, 747 - 400 pilots were encouraged to submit reports to their respective safety agencies if they had experienced any positive or negative incidents with the use of FANS. Upon receipt of a report, it was evaluated and if deemed pertinent to the study, a telephone interview or 'callback' was conducted on the FANS incident to elicit further details, capture the key events, and gather contextual information. Once the operational data collection phase was completed, the reports and interviews were analyzed with two purposes in mind: primarily to identify and address problematic human factors issues with current FANS technology, and, secondarily, to provide 'lessons learned' for future datalink systems and implementation...|$|R
