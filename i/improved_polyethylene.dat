XLPE has been studied extensively in vitro [11, 12], and in a Boston hip simulator it was shown that the linear wear rate of electron beam XLPE was extremely low and independent of femoral head size for standard size femoral heads (22 – 32  mm) [13]. Preliminary clinical studies of XLPE in small series of patients undergoing THA have confirmed these promising findings with a 45 – 99 % reduction in wear compared with conventional polyethylene at 3 – 5  years [14 – 20].

40|$|Abstract: Ultra-high {{molecular}} weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) remains {{the gold standard}} acetabular bearing material for hip arthroplasty. Its successful performance has shown consistent results and survivorship in total hip replacement (THR) above 85 % after 15 years, with different patients, surgeons, or designs. As THR results have been challenged by wear, oxidation, and liner fracture, relevant research on the material properties {{in the past decade}} has led to the development and clinical introduction of highly crosslinked polyethylenes (HXLPE). More stress on the bearing (more active, overweighted, younger patients), and more variability in the implantation technique in different small and large Hospitals may further compromise the clinical performance for many patients. The long-term in vivo performance of these materials remains to be proven. Clinical and retrieval studies after more than 5 years of in vivo use with HXLPE in THR are reviewed and consistently show a substantial decrease in wear rate. Moreover, a second generation of <b>improved</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> is backed by in vitro data and awaits more clinical experience to confirm the experimental improvements. Also, new antioxidant, free radical scavengers, candidates and the reinforcement of polyethylene through composites are currently under basic research. Oxidation of polyethylene is today significantly reduced by present formulations, and this forgiving, affordable, and wellknown material is still reliable to meet today’s higher requirements in total hip replacement...|$|R

The reaction employed stereoselective transesterification of (S) -benzoin with lipase TL® from Pseudomonas stutzeri and racemization of (R) -benzoin with Metal-TUD- 1, a metal-associated acidic meso-porous silicate, in pure organic solvent. Enzyme performance was improved by immobilization on Accurel MP 1001 (yielding Acc-LipTL), and Zr-TUD- 1 (Si/Zr = 25) {{was identified as}} most effective racemization catalyst.

40|$|International audienceContrary to {{many other}} viruses, the initial steps of the {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) infection, including attachment to hepatocytes, specific receptor interactions, and membrane fusion, are unsolved. Using HepaRG cells as an in vitro cell culture system, we here report that HBV entry into hepatocytes depends on the interaction with the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains of cell-surface-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Binding to GAGs requires {{the integrity of the}} pre-S domain {{as a part of the}} large (L-) viral envelope protein. HBV infection was abrogated by incubation of virions with heparin, but not the structurally related GAGs chondroitin sulfate A, B, and C. Infection was also abolished by suramin, a known inhibitor of duck hepatitis B virus infection or highly sulfated dextran sulfate. Polycationic substances such as poly-L-lysine, polybrene, and protamine also prevented infection, however, by addressing cellular components. Enzymatic removal of defined acidic carbohydrate structures from the cell surface using heparinase I/III or the obstruction of GAG synthesis by sodium chlorate inhibited HBV infection of HepaRG cells and, moreover, led to a reduction of HBV cell surface binding sites. The biochemical analysis showed selective binding of L-protein-enriched viral particles (virions or filaments) to heparin. GAG-dependent binding of HBV was <b>improved</b> by <b>polyethylene</b> glycol, a substance that specifically enhances HBV infection. Conclusion: HBV infection requires the initial attachment to the carbohydrate side chains of hepatocyte-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans as attachment receptors.

40|$|Endothelial {{function}} is impaired by oxidative stress in chronic heart failure (HF). Mechanisms that protect against increases in oxidative stress in HF are not clear. The {{goal of this}} study was to determine whether manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) plays a key role in protecting against endothelial dysfunction in HF. Endothelial function and gene expression were examined in aorta from wild-type mice (MnSOD+/+) and mice deficient in MnSOD (MnSOD+/−) 12 wk after ligation of the left coronary artery (LCA). LCA ligation produced similar size myocardial infarctions in MnSOD+/+ and MnSOD+/− mice and reduced ejection fraction to ∼ 20 % in both groups. Maximal relaxation in response to acetylcholine was 78 ± 3 % (mean ± SE) and 66 ± 8 % in sham-operated MnSOD+/+ and MnSOD+/− mice, respectively. Expression of antioxidant enzymes increased in MnSOD+/+ mice with HF, and maximal relaxation to acetylcholine was slightly impaired (68 ± 4 %). Greater endothelial dysfunction was observed in MnSOD+/− mice with HF (46 ± 5 %, P < 0. 05), which was significantly <b>improved</b> by <b>polyethylene</b> glycol-catalase but not Tempol. Incubation with the nonspecific cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin or the COX 1 inhibitor valeryl salicylate, but not the COX- 2 inhibitor NS- 398, significantly improved relaxation to acetylcholine in HF mice (maximum relaxation = 74 ± 5, 91 ± 1, and 58 ± 5 %).

40|$|Ph. D.,Dept. of Orthopaedic Surgery, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, 2009. Total hip {{replacement}} (THR) {{is an effective}} method of treatment for patients with hip disability. The procedure is capable of providing long-term functional improvement with excellent control of pain and restoration of function. Sir J Charnley developed a concept of low friction arthroplasty, {{which was based on}} use of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene acetabular and stainless steel femoral components. The components were attached to bone with the use of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement. This concept has been very successful, and is considered the gold standard of THR. Aseptic loosening of the prosthetic components remains the single most important reason for failure of THRs. Wear to the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) acetabular cup is a well-known cause of osteolysis and aseptic loosening of the components. Thus, substantial improvement to the wear resistance of UHMWPE could extend the clinical life span of total {{hip replacement}}s. In an attempt to reduce polyethylene wear and subsequent osteolysis, a method was developed in the early seventies in South Africa to <b>improve</b> <b>polyethylene</b> quality by means of gamma ray cross-linking. The acetabular cup was irradiated with 100 Kilogray in an acetylene environment, which was used as a cross-linking gas material, resulting in improvement of UHMWPE wear resistance. Influenced by the world trend and with the advent of a ceramic bearing surface, the Project of cross-linking was, to a certain extent, forgotten. Patients followed up in the late 1990 s, showed minimal or total absence of wear after 15 years or longer. 3 Based on my preliminary studies, and anticipating the world trend of acceptance of cross- link UHMWPE, the aim of this research is to consolidate the results from the largest long term group of patients with acetylene cross-link UHMWPE, to study polyethylene gamma irradiated {{in the presence of a}} cross-linking acetiylene gas and the effects of it, in vitro, using a hip simulator. I was planning to communicate with as many patients as possible from the group operated on from 1977 until 1983 in whom cross-link UHMWPE was used. This group of over thousand patients represents the largest group of patients with cross-linked UHMWPE acetabular components in the world, with the longest clinical follow up of over 20 years on average. The first part of the research is a retrospective study: The goal was to contact as many patients as possible who were operated on during the period 1977 to 1983 when cross-linked polyethylene was used. To qualified for the study each patient had to have an early postoperative and the latest follow up radiograph. The radiological study consisted of the radiological measurement of wear. For this purpose the Hip Analysis Suite program was used. This is a software program designed by Dr John M. Martell from the University of Chicago, which is widely used and internationally accepted for that purpose. Image analysis offers significant improvements in reproducibility and accuracy when compared to manual analysis. 4 The final results were compared with results of polyethylene wear in patients in whom conventional UHMWPE was used. For this comparison only patients with acetabular components made from the same UHMWPE material and from the same supplier were used. The conventional UHMWPE is a component of the gold standard of hip replacement surgery. World-wide published follow up studies of 15 years and longer using conventional UHMWPE were compared to the cross-link UHMWPE group. If revision surgery was indicated for whatever reason in patients in with cross-linked UHMWPE acetabular components, the retrieved prosthesis was analyzed. The analysis consisted of examination of the articular surface of the cross-linked acetabular component for micro wear phenomena using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). In order to perform an objective analysis of the retrieved components, two independent laboratories were used, namely: Peterson Tribology Laboratory, Loma Linda University, California, and Biomechanical Laboratory, Faculty of Engineering, University of Pretoria. The analyses were possible thanks to collaboration with Dr Ian Clark from Peterson Tribology Laboratory and Dr NDL Burger in charge of the Biomechanical Laboratory at the Department of Engineering, University of Pretori...|$|R

To <b>improve</b> our design, <b>poly(ethylene</b> glycol) diacrylate based hydrogel system was utilized as a blank slate to study the phenotypic regulation by cell material interactions. Fibrinogen, fibronectin, laminin and collagen type IV were incorporated into the hydrogel to mimic the stimuli from extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Surprisingly, no significant effect was detected on induction of smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation marker expression, activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases pathway, or alteration of surface integrin expression profile. However, fibronectin showed repression of undesired phenotypes in SMC differentiation. In contrast to ECM proteins, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) showed more influence on regulating SMC phenotype. By using a scaffold environment intended to be mimetic of early atherosclerosis, the impact of GAG identity on SMC foam cell formation was explored. We focused on chondroitin sulfate C (CSC), dermatan sulfate (DS), and an intermediate molecular weight hyaluronan (HA_IMW, ~ 400 kDa), the levels and/or distribution of which are significantly altered in atherosclerosis. CSC and DS hydrogels were associated with greater SMC phagocytosis of apolipoprotein B than HA_IMW gels. However, only SMCs in DS constructs maintained increased expression of adipocyte marker A-FABP relative to HA_IMW gels over 35 days of culture. Combined, our results suggested interesting roles for fibronectin and HA_IMW in repression of undesired phenotypes in SMC differentiation, which could give insights into rational design of novel biomaterials for vascular tissue engineering applications...|$|R

The first section (Chapters 2 - 4) reports the formation of mesoporous silica films with spherical, cylindrical and bicontinuous pores up to 40 nm in diameter through replicating the morphologies of the solid block copolymer (BCP) templates, polystyrene-b-poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PS-b-PtBA), via phase selective condensation of tetraethylorthosilicate in supercritical CO 2. Next, directed self-assembly was used to control the orientation of cylindrical domains in PS- b-PtBA templates. Large-area aligned mesochannels in silica films with diameters tunable between 5 and 30 nm were achieved through the replication of oriented templates via scCO 2 infusion. The long-range alignment of mesochannels was confirmed through GISAXS with sample stage azimuthal rotation. ^ In the second section (Chapters 5 - 6), enantiopure tartaric acid {{was used as an}} additive to dramatically <b>improve</b> ordering in <b>poly(ethylene</b> oxide-block- tert-butyl acrylate) (PEO-b-PtBA) copolymers. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray scattering were used to study the phase behavior and morphologies within both bulk and thin films. With the addition of a photo acid generator, photo-induced disorder in the PEO-b-PtBA/tartaric acid composite system was achieved upon UV exposure which deprotected the PtBA block to yield poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), which is phase-miscible with PEO. Area-selective UV exposure using a photo-mask was applied with the assistance of trace amounts of base quencher to achieve high-resolution hierarchical patterns. Helical superstructures were observed by TEM in this BCP/chiral additive system with 3 D handedness confirmed by TEM tomography. ^ In the last section (Chapter 7), ultra-high loadings of nanoparticles into target domains of block copolymer composites were achieved by blending the block copolymer hosts with small molecule additives that exhibit strong interactions with one of the polymer chain segments and with the nanoparticle ligands via hydrogen bonding. The addition of 40 wt% D-tartaric acid to poly(ethylene oxide-block-tert-butyl acrylate) (PEO-b-PtBA) enabled the loading of up to 150 wt% of 4 -hydroxythiophenol functionalized Au nanoparticles relative to the mass of the target hydrophilic domain. This was equivalent to over 40 % Au by mass of the resulting well ordered composite as measured by thermal gravimetric analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract As mobile {{communication}} moves from 3 G to 4 G, the bandwidth used will be extended from 2 GHz to 5 GHz. The propagation loss {{is related to}} the 2. 6 :th power of frequency, thus a large increase in power consumption may be expected. The dielectric properties of the insulation in coaxial cables are of increasing importance for the propagation losses at high frequencies. “Electrically clean” polyethylene grades have very good dielectric properties up to 1 GHz after which the dielectric losses can increase. Foaming of <b>polyethylene</b> <b>improves</b> the dielectric properties even further. The aim of the present work is to gain an improved understanding of the dielectric losses in polyethylene foams. The dielectric properties of solid high density polyethylene (HDPE) as well as foamed blends of low density polyethylene (LDPE) with HDPE were evaluated at medium and high frequencies using a broadband high-resolution dielectric spectrometer, a split post dielectric resonator and a cavity resonator equipped with a rectangular waveguide. The foamed samples were prepared by extrusion through a slit die using a laboratory scale single screw extruder. It was found that foaming reduced both the dielectric constant and the dielectric loss factor at medium and high frequencies and increasing porosity led to a better performance. However, increasing the porosity further than 50 % would require improved strain hardening properties of the melt. Useful die temperatures for foaming were between 195 °C and 210 °C. Incorporation of the chemical blowing agent azodicarbonamide increased significantly the dielectric loss factor of both the processed and unprocessed foaming blends. Deformation of foam cells occurred when the consolidating melt was subjected to drawing and compression. The cells became elongated and flattened which can reduce the dielectric losses. In order to study the dielectric properties of solid HDPE, eight technical grades differing in molecular characteristics, catalyst types, co-monomer types and additive content were used. Samples were prepared by compression moulding the materials into plaques. The dielectric losses, as given by the dielectric loss tangent, decreased more or less linearly with an increasing degree of crystallinity for this series of polyethylenes. Lower dielectric losses were also associated with a higher melting point. An increased dielectric loss tangent could furthermore be related to a higher content of carbonyl and trans-vinylene groups. To some extent, this could be associated with a corresponding reduction in the crystallinity. Key words: Dielectric properties, polyethylene, frequency, foaming, crystallinity, porosity...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} carried out in the {{facilities}} of Dynasol Elastomers in Gajano, Cantabria, Spain, and the main aim was to study the influence of rubber manufactured in Dynasol when they are added to prepare polyethylene films. The low-density polyethylene {{is one of the most}} demanded polymers in Europe after polypropylene. Each year, 8, 2 million tons of low density polyethylene are sold only in Europe. If these data were extrapolated for all the world, it could be 6 times greater. On the other hand, packaging (films, bags) is the area that demands the highest amount of plastics, about 40 %, and particularly, the most used polymer for packaging is low density polyethylene. For these reasons, for rubber manufacturers like Dynasol Elastomers, it is very important to know how different types of rubber (SBS, SEBS) affect low density polyethylene films. If rubber could improve the mechanical and optical properties of films, its market opportunities would greatly be expanded. In addition, it is necessary to point out that there is a lack of information about SBS or SEBS / LDPE or LLDPE blends. The literature review that {{was carried out}} revealed that there were no information published about the influence of SBS or SEBS rubber (in low percentages) in the mechanical and optical properties of low density polyethylene blown films. Therefore, to fill this gap, this work analyses the influence of three types of rubber (linear SBS, linear and decoupled SBS and linear SEBS) manufactured by Dynasol Elastomers in the properties of common low density polyethylene used in the production of blown film. To evaluate the mechanical properties of blown film produced from SBS or SEBS / LDPE or LLDPE blends, four different types of tests were carried out (percent elongation and tensile strength at break, tear strength, tensile set and sealability) following the international standards. The addition of rubber C 500 and CH 6180 X when preparing polyethylene blown film resulted in very successful values of percent elongation and tensile strength at break of 522 % and 14, 8 MPa, respectively, which clearly improved the values of pure polyethylene (290 % and 10, 4 MPa, respectively). One of the most successful and relevant results in this work is the significant decrease of tension set under constant elongation, which means a better elastic recovery. Particularly, for blown films from blends with a 10 % of rubber CH 6180 X, the recovery capacity is increased by 20 % in comparison to pure polyethylene results. To evaluate optical properties three tests were carried out (opacity, haze and gloss) following the international standards. The results reported in this work prove that the optical properties of the films are kept, which is especially noteworthy. Generally, optical properties of films are worsened in these mixing processes. However, rubber CH 6180 X and LDPE blend is able to keep and even to improve the optical properties of films, specially haze and opacity, while, at the same time, improving mechanical properties. It must be emphasized that this work can provide new market opportunities for types of rubber like CH 6180 X and, even, C 500, since this kind of rubber have <b>improved</b> the low-density <b>polyethylene</b> film mechanical properties as well as the optical properties. This fact confirms that mechanical qualities can be improved without deteriorating the optical properties by adding rubber as main component to modify low density polyethylene. These improvements can become very relevant information for any kind of packaging market, like more resistant bags for heavy stuff where a big amount of polymer is commercialized, but moreover, this can also be important for sanitary instrumentation where very strict properties are required or for specialized packaging like in the food area.
