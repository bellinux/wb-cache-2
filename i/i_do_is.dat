25|$|This is a {{book that}} clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; {{but that is not}} a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and {{refreshing}} to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it, because it is supposed to infuriate people like me, and the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book as much as <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

"Some joyous shagging songs, though, are paltry {{excitement}} {{beside that}} of seeing an artist of such fame, long held as iconic without enough genuinely exciting music {{to back it}} up, reach her full throttle of awesomeness. The video for 'Ghost' sums it up best, Beyonce glaring and writhing defiantly as she speak-sings 'I'm climbing up the wall ’cause all the shit I hear is boring/All the shit <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> boring/All these record labels boring'. Let's hope Beyonce keeps {{finding new ways to}} amuse herself – there could be some very interesting times ahead." ...|$|E

[...] In April, he wrote an article for The Players' Tribune titled [...] "Letter to My Younger Self", describing his NFL career and life after its end.|$|E
500|$|So {{this song}} is about me {{basically}} saying that just because {{all of those things}} are there [...] doesn't mean that there is not sort of the same person underneath. And then, also that these veils, they are really just protecting me from the thing that I held the most sacred, which is my creativity ... My Aura is the way that I deal with my insanity and I feel quite insane, so this song sounds very insane ... Everyone thinks that everything <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.|$|E

500|$|Kavner {{was then}} {{cast as a}} sidekick to Tracey Ullman in The Tracey Ullman Show, which debuted on Fox in 1987. Kavner {{described}} the show as, [...] "like being back in school, {{a chance to play}} a wide variety of characters, some really vicious people, to not rest on laurels, to not play it safe". Kavner commented, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> not mimicry or an impersonation, but more of an assimilation. [...] {{we did a lot of}} looking at people to find out who to base our characters on. We did our homework on our lunch hour." [...] She received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Best Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.|$|E
500|$|Today they {{finished}} shooting my {{portion of the}} picture and I am certainly glad it's over with. [...] All <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> sing [...] "Hate to Get Up in the Morning" [...] as I did in the show, but the camera is a severe judge and I am afraid even with the great amount of care and fuss they can't improve what the Fates decreed to be a homely face. [...] As for my voice, I made a recording. [...] When the record was first played on the set, one of the electricians, who didn't know whose voice it was, said, [...] "If the guy who wrote that song could hear the record, he would turn over in his grave"--which gives you a fair idea. [...] However I am hoping it won't be too bad.|$|E
500|$|Beresford also clashed on {{set with}} Brimley. On {{the very first}} day of filming, he asked the actor to [...] "pick up the pace", {{prompting}} Brimley to reply, [...] "Hey, I didn't know anybody dropped it." [...] On another occasion, when Beresford tried to advise Brimley on how Harry would behave, Duvall recalled Brimley responding, [...] "Now look, let me tell you something, I'm Harry. Harry's not over there, Harry's not over here. Until you fire me or get another actor, I'm Harry, and whatever <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> fine 'cause I'm Harry." [...] Duvall said he believed the on-set wrangling resulted in a combination of the director's and actors' visions and ultimately improved the picture. Likewise, Beresford said he did not feel the fights negatively affected the film because he and Duvall never disagreed on the interpretation of the Mac Sledge character.|$|E
50|$|What Should <b>I</b> <b>Do?</b> <b>was</b> a {{short-lived}} educational series focusing on moral topics originally produced in animation {{during the late}} 1960s and early 1970s by The Walt Disney Company's educational media division.

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Arthur Pierson, and was produced by Glenn Goodwin, while Wayne Isham {{was in charge of}} photography. At the time of the song's release, Madonna's style of dress was catching on as a fashion statement among club kids and her fans. The most prominent among her fashion accessories were the crucifixes she wore as earrings and necklaces. Madonna commented that wearing a rosary and a crucifix is [...] "kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, the crucifixes seem to go with my name." [...] In reality, she was trying to find a separate image for herself, being inspired by then artists like Boy George, Cyndi Lauper and David Bowie, and their constantly shifting image and persona. Madonna realized the importance of her music videos and its popularity via MTV—launched in 1981—was instrumental in popularizing her image.|$|E

[...] He reiterated his contention of Jewish control over the media, {{as well as his}} prior stance on Holocaust denial, and said that his aim was to [...] " [...] political power so as to be able to institute changes, to undo the population shift which has taken place since 1948 with the first Immigration Act, to peacefully and as humanely as possible reverse that and to return Britain to being a homogeneous white nation".|$|E
500|$|According to a 2009 {{article in}} The New York Times, Tolle is [...] "not {{identified}} with any religion, but uses teachings from Zen Buddhism, Sufism, Hinduism and the Bible".

[...] Tolle has mentioned texts such as the Tao Te Ching, the Bhagavad Gita and other Hindu scriptures, the Buddhist scriptures, the Old Testament, the New Testament, and A Course in Miracles; he has mentioned various individuals such as Zoroaster, Lao Tzu, Mahavira, Gautama Buddha, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Jesus, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Rumi, Meister Eckhart, Hafiz, Rinzai Gigen, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Carl Gustav Jung; and he has emphasized the mystical schools within religions such as Gnosticism in Christianity, Sufism in Islam, Hasidism and Kabbala in Judaism, Advaita Vedanta in Hinduism, and Zen and Dzogchen in Buddhism.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] was {{directed}} by Alex De Rakoff in early November 2004. Clarkson told MTV that she conceived {{the idea of the}} video after assuming that revenge is what every girl wants to do when their boyfriend cheats on them. She added, [...] "You know, 'Why don't I just go trash her house? [...] And so I do it in the video. All <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> break stuff. It's a cool job. I could get used to this." [...] Clarkson expressed that in the music video, viewers would get to see her act out of character. She explained, [...] "In the beginning, I'm like tipping things over and smearing mud all over the walls and it seems like my apartment, but it ends up being the other girl's that he's with, so it's a humorous video." [...] The music video premiered on Total Request Live on November 16, 2004.|$|E
500|$|For Pink Friday, Minaj created another alter ego: Roman Zolanski, [...] "a demon inside her", Minaj's [...] "twin brother" [...] whose {{character}} she assumes {{when she}} is angry. Roman {{has been compared to}} Eminem's alter ego Slim Shady, and on [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] Minaj and Eminem collaborate as their alter egos. On her next album, she said {{that there would be a}} lot of Roman: [...] "And if you're not familiar with Roman, then you will be familiar with him very soon. He's the boy that lives inside of me. He's a lunatic and he's gay and he'll be on there a lot." [...] Roman has a mother, Martha Zolanski, who appeared on [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] with a British accent and singing on [...] "Roman Holiday" [...] for the first time. Martha appeared in the [...] "Moment 4 Life" [...] video as Minaj's apparent fairy godmother.

While Ludacris wore a black vest similar to in the [...] "How Low" [...] video, Minaj's attire was from the [...] "My Chick Bad" [...] video, as she donned a pink wig and similar clothing as in the Freddy Kruger-lair scene. Ludacris and Minaj performed the song at MTV's Spring Break 2010 in Acapulco, Mexico, featuring Minaj donning a blonde wig. The duo also performed the song at the 2010 BET Awards on June 27, 2010, {{as a part of}} a medley with the remix of [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Is</b> Win", featuring Ludacris in a mask, flanked by violin players, and Minaj with a spiraling blonde wig seated in a medieval chair, similar to her scene in the music video.
