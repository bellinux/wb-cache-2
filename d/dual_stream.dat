50|$|In {{situations}} where the network bandwidth is severely limited, recording at the edge is a savior for high quality recorded video {{but it does not}} solve the challenge of needing to view live video over a restricted network. Some encoders support <b>dual</b> <b>streaming.</b> This is a concept that enables the encoder to deliver two totally independent streams of video, separately configured for different frame rates and video resolutions. Typically for limited bandwidth networks one high quality stream is used for local recording, and a lower quality, which translates to a lower bit rate, is used for viewing live. Conversely for high bandwidth networks, the same stream will be used to record locally and centrally, and Automatic Network Replenishment is used to fill any gaps in the centralized recording dues to network interruptions.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} how to help ensure that children considered to have special needs within the primary school context are enabled to overcome the difficulties they are facing. The premise of this dissertation {{is that this is}} most effectively achieved when the child, her teacher and her parents have a genuine role within the decision-making process concerning how to meet such needs. The functioning of the two key relationships in addressing these needs form the focus of this study. Specifically, these are the relationships between the child and her teacher, and her parents and her teacher. The literature relating to these relationships is explored. It seeks to blend the <b>dual</b> <b>streams</b> of literature relating to such relationships in the special needs context with that of the everyday relationships of primary school life. It explores the literature relating to the effect of the process of the Individual Education Plan on these relationships. It notes that the majority of such literature focuses on statemented children and often does not have a specific focus on the primary aged child at the earlier, school based stages of the Code of Practice (1994). This perceived "gap" in the research literature forms the rationale for the research study which follows. The research is within the practitioner-researcher tradition and is located withm the school that I am a teacher at. It is qualitative in nature with a focus on a detailed exploration of a small sample. It utilises an interview technique to gain its data. The study argues that while genuine involvement is often sought, and even presumed, the context of the primary school, the processes of special education and the attitudes of the participants to the relationships tend to result in the teacher retaining the dominant role within the decision making process. It also suggests that the process of the Individual Education Plan may have a somewhat different effect on functioning of the two relationships from that which is often described within the literature. The dissertation concludes by drawing out the factors which appear to determine whether such relationships are genuinely involving, or not. These are described. It then suggests one way in which the findings of the research may be practically applied to enhancing the quality of the two relationships which form the basis of this study and so ensure that the needs of the children within the primary school context are most effectively met...|$|R

The geometry {{may be a}} single or a <b>dual</b> flowing <b>stream.</b> The interior grid points are computed using the unsplit MacCormack scheme.

Typical problems that can be solved concern nozzles, inlets, jet powered afterbodies, airfoils, and free jet expansions.

40|$|Previous {{proposals}} for implementing instruction-level temporal redundancy in out-of-order cores have reported a performance degradation of upto 45 % in certain applications {{compared to an}} execution which {{does not have any}} temporal redundancy. An important contributor to this problem is the insufficient number of ALUs for handling the amplified load injected into the core. At the same time, increasing the number of ALUs can increase the complexity of the issue logic, which has been pointed {{out to be one of}} the most timing critical components of the processor. This paper proposes a novel extension of a prior idea on instruction reuse to ease ALU bandwidth requirements in a complexity-effective way by exploiting certain interesting properties of a dual (temporally redundant) instruction stream. We present microarchitectural extensions necessary for implementing an instruction reuse buffer (IRB) and integrating this with the issue logic of a <b>dual</b> instruction <b>stream</b> superscalar core, and conduct extensive evaluations to demonstrate how well it can alleviate the ALU bandwidth problem. We show that on the average we can gain back nearly 50 % of the IPC loss that occurred due to ALU bandwidth limitations for an instruction-level temporally redundant superscalar execution, and 23 % of the overall IPC loss.

In the context of a {{supervisory}} control system for the JSC Robonaut humanoid robot, we have developed an 'intelligent assistant' that integrates an Artificial Intelligence planner (JSHOP 2) with execution monitoring of the state of both the human supervisor and the remote robot. The assistant reasons simultaneously about the world state {{on both sides of the}} time delay, which represents a novel application of this technology. The purpose of the assistant is to provide advice to the human supervisor about current and future activities, derived from a sequence of high-level goals to be achieved. To do this, the assistant must simultaneously monitor and react to various data sources, including actions taken by the supervisor who is issuing commands to the robot (e. g. with a data glove), actions taken by the robot, and the environment of the robot, both as currently perceived over the time delay, along with the current sequence of goals. We have developed a 'leader/follower' software architecture to handle the <b>dual</b> time-shifted <b>streams</b> of execution feedback.
