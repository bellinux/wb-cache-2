25|$|A baler is a {{piece of}} farm {{machinery}} used to compress a cut and raked crop (such as hay, straw, or silage) into compact bales that are easy to handle, transport and store. Several different types of balers are commonly used, each producing a different type of bales – rectangular or cylindrical (round), of various sizes, bound with twine, netting, or wire. The round <b>hay</b> <b>baler</b> was invented by Ummo F. Luebben of Sutton, Nebraska, which he conceived with his brother Melchior in 1903, and then patented in 1910. The invention of the round <b>hay</b> <b>baler</b> revolutionized the laborious task of haying into a one-man, low-cost operation with a machine that automatically gathered the hay, rolled into a round bale, and ejected it.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, Australia, {{and around}} the world, baling wire was used in {{mechanical}} <b>hay</b> <b>balers</b> pulled behind a tractor. The automated balers used a wire twister that first cut then twisted {{the ends of the}} wire such that the bale kept its shape after the baler had pressed the hay into a tight rectangular bale. These <b>hay</b> <b>balers</b> were in common use up until the late 1980s. When the hay was fed to livestock the wire was cut and often hung in bundles or stored in barrels or metal drums around the farm. Farmers used the soft wire for temporary repairs of almost everything you could think of on the farm, from fences, old leather horse harnesses, head stalls and bridles, to pins to keep castellated nuts in place on the tractor. Even tiny screwdrivers were made by cutting a short length of wire and looping one end for grip. The other end was then flattened and shaped to make a screwdriver for specialized tasks like replacing the tiny screws in reading glasses.|$|R

50|$|In {{agricultural}} equipment an overrunning clutch is typically used on <b>hay</b> <b>balers</b> {{and other equipment}} with a high inertial load, particularly when {{used in conjunction with}} a tractor without a live power take-off (PTO). Without a live PTO, a high inertial load can cause the tractor to continue to move forward even when the foot clutch is depressed, creating an unsafe condition. By disconnecting the load from the PTO under these conditions, the overrunning clutch improves safety. Similarly, many unpowered 'push' cylinder lawnmowers use a freewheel to drive the blades: these are geared or chain-driven to rotate at high speed and the freewheel prevents their momentum being transferred in the reverse direction through the drive when the machine is halted.|$|R

50|$|Stone pickers {{are used}} in farming and landscaping, where stones need {{to be removed from}} the soil and ground surface to prevent damage to other farm {{machinery}} (such as <b>hay</b> <b>balers,</b> combines, and mowers), improve the soil for crop production, or improve the appearance of the ground surface in preparation for a lawn or a golf course. Surface stones and large rocks often left from plowing can damage a hay bailer, the header or reciprocating knives on a combine, and blades on a rotary mower. Land with rock instead of fine soil are often less useful for crops. Thus, removing stones from the soil also ensures a more consistent yield. Additionally, using stone pickers is particularly useful for crops forming tubers (such as potatoes) in the ground.|$|R

5000|$|Not all {{stationary}} {{wire tying}} balers used 2 wires. It {{was not uncommon}} for the larger bale size (usually 17" [...] x 22") machines to use 'boards' that had three slots for wires and hence tied three wires per bale. Most North American manufacturers produced these machines as either regular models or as size options. 'Small square' three wire tying pick-up balers were available from the early 1930s, principally from J. I. Case & Co. and Ann Arbor. These machines were hand tying and hand threading machines. Although New Holland credits itself with inventing the 'successful small square twine tying baler', it produced such machines {{for the first time}} in 1940 after acquiring Ed Nolte and his baler. This baler baled successfully from 1937 onwards. Certainly the quality of the New Holland machines, popularised twine tying <b>hay</b> <b>balers.</b> In Europe, in as early as 1939, both Claas of Germany and Rousseau SA of France had automatic twine tying pick-up balers. Most of these produced low density bales though. The first successful pick-up balers were made by the Ann Arbor Company in 1929. Ann Arbor were acquired by the Oliver Farm Equipment Company in 1943. Despite their head start on the rest of the field, no Ann Arbor balers carried automatic knotters or twisters. Oliver introduced these in 1949.|$|R

40|$|From 1945 to 1972 Iowa farmers remade their {{landscape}} {{in the image}} of an industrial model characterized by large-scale production, the substitution of capital for labor, strict cost accounting, specialization, and efficiency. Farm families were leaders in adopting new technology to solve their problems in the post World War II period, a contrast to the pre-war years when experts such as college educated professionals, journalists, and industry leaders advocated the application of industrial ideals to agriculture. Many farmers industrialized production because of a persistent postwar farm labor shortage and a cost-price squeeze in which the prices farmers paid for products increased faster than prices they received for commodities. They used pesticides, fertilizer, and feed additives to boost yields and livestock gains as well as altered crop rotations and traditional cycles of livestock production. They purchased, borrowed, or hired new machines, remodeled existing structures or built new ones. Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s landscape of the early 1970 s was still dedicated to agriculture, but new agricultural production techniques resulted in changed land use patterns and work cycles that would have been unrecognizable to farmers who lived from 1900 to 1945.;By 1972 pesticides, fertilizers, feed additives, <b>hay</b> <b>balers,</b> and combines were common on Iowa farms. While a minority of producers used combines for harvesting shelled corn and confinement feeding systems, the value of these practices for lowering unit costs and maximizing production was proven. Many new techniques that increased production simultaneously created problems. Farmers learned that success in controlling pest species allowed new pest species that were resistant to pesticides to thrive. Public concern over pesticide, fertilizer, feed additives, and manure runoff also led to government regulation that limited farmers 2 ̆ 7 technological choices. Furthermore, as farmers invested more money in pesticides and fertilizer, they found that they needed expensive new harvesting and grain storage techniques to reduce harvest losses.

40|$|Individuals {{engaged in}} farming have higher risks of injury and death from trauma {{than many other}} workers. Fatalities most often involve tractor-related {{incident}} such as roll-overs. Although it is also recognized that farm machinery may result in serious injuries and death, little has been reported on problems associated with hay baling, transport and storage. Case 1 : A 43 -year-old man trying to dislodge jammed hay in a <b>hay</b> <b>baler</b> had either been pulled, or had fallen, into the baler, {{where he had been}} crushed, rotated and then cocooned within a hay bale. The body showed extensive blunt trauma to the head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis and limbs, with burning from a fire that subsequently started within the overheated machine. Case 2 : A 58 -year-old man was crushed between the moving arms of a hay shuttle and a safety fence. Death was attributed to blunt chest and abdominal trauma with crush asphyxia. Case 3 : A 56 -year-old man fell some distance from the top of stacked hay bales fracturing his neck and causing virtual transection of his cervical spinal cord. These cases demonstrate rare forms of farm deaths that may be associated with the creation (baling), moving (shuttling) and storage of hay bales. All forms of farm machinery should be treated circumspectly, given the possibility that serious injury or death may result from inattention or inappropriate handling.

40|$|Precision Agriculture is {{continuously}} {{trying to}} address the sources and factors affecting the in-field variability and taking appropriate managerial decisions. One of the popular research focuses in the recent three decades {{has been on the}} development of new approaches to making yield variability maps. Advancement in development of sensors and the importance of quality factor in high value crops has motivated scientists to investigate real-time and nondestructive testing methods. This study tried to introduce and evaluate a new approach to concurrent yield mapping and to estimate some nutritional qualitative factors of alfalfa production. In this study, yield quantity was determined by measurement of added hay slice in every hay compression cycle by employing a new star wheel and integrating its output with positioning data from Global Positioning System. To predict some nutritional quality properties, measurement of specific shear energy applied on the cutting blade and compressive energy on plunger head of a <b>hay</b> <b>baler</b> in field conditions were also evaluated. The results of statistical analysis of yield quantity measurement data showed a very good correlation between the suggested approach and yield mass (r= 0. 96 and R 2 = 0. 92). The results of using specific shear energy for estimation of crude fiber and cumulative index RFV with regard to field conditions were rated as acceptable. Using specific compression energy was suitable only for estimating the dry matter. None of the suggested methods was able to estimate the hay crude protein.
