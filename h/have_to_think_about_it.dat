25|$|Much of what I {{did with}} my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a {{different}} body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember {{to get rid of}} the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{creating}} a reality series originated in 2006 when Kris Jenner showed an interest in appearing on a television show together with her family. Jenner commented: [...] "Everybody thinks that [...] could create a bunch of drama in their lives, but it's something that I felt I didn't even <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> <b>It</b> would be natural." [...] Producer Ryan Seacrest, who had his own production company, decided to develop the idea, having the popular family-based show The Osbournes in mind. He hired a camera man to visit the Kardashian's family home to film them having a Sunday barbeque: [...] "They were all together [...] as crazy and as fun as loving as they are," [...] Seacrest described the family after seeing the tape. He later initiated the series by sharing the tape with E!, an American cable network which features mostly entertainment-related programming, and reality television series; the show was eventually picked up. In August 2007, {{it was announced that}} the Kardashian and Jenner families would star in a yet-to-be-titled reality show on E! described as a [...] "new non-scripted family sitcom", being produced by Ryan Seacrest and Bunim/Murray Productions. The series' announcement came one week after Paris Hilton and her friend Nicole Richie announced that their popular E! series, The Simple Life, was ending.|$|E

2500|$|Hopper paid {{particular}} attention to geometrical design and the careful placement of human figures in proper balance with their environment. He was a slow and methodical artist; as he wrote, [...] "It {{takes a long time}} for an idea to strike. Then I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for a long time. I don't start painting until I have it all worked out in my mind. I'm all right when I get to the easel". He often made preparatory sketches to work out his carefully calculated compositions.

50|$|In {{a passage}} from Hell's Angels: Long Nights, Ugly Days, Orgy of the Doomed... Thompson sums up his fascination {{with the world of}} writing:I found out then that writing is a kind of therapy.

You might be wrong, but you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> very intensely to write about it. So I use writing as a learning tool.|$|E

50|$|Virtual {{engineering}} allows {{engineers to}} work with objects in a virtual space without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the objects' underlying technical information.

Engineers must also be able to create a picture of the system, the various parts of the system, and how the parts will interact with each other. When engineers can focus on the making decisions for particular engineering issues rather than the underlying technical information, design cycles and costs are reduced.|$|R
