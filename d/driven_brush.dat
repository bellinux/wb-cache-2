Different modes of brushing (manual, powered, rotary-oscillatory or sonically driven) influence the SCF in different ways. Our objectives were to compare boundary lubrication of SCFs after different modes of brushing and {{to explain their}} lubrication {{on the basis of}} their roughness, dehydrated layer thickness, and degree of glycosylation. A pilot study was performed to relate in vitro lubrication with mouthfeel in human volunteers. Coefficient of friction (COF) on 16 -h-old SCFs after manual, rotary-oscillatory, and sonically <b>driven</b> <b>brushing</b> was measured using colloidal probe atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM was also used to assess the roughness of SCFs prior to and after brushing. Dehydrated layer thicknesses and glycosylation of the SCFs were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this article}} is to provide a review of common power {{toothbrush}} technologies with a focus on the oscillating-rotating motion used in a novel toothbrush; describe features to drive compliance such as the “SmartGuide™ ” innovation; and finally recommend steps to motivate patients to adopt a power toothbrush as part of their home care regimen. Background: Contemporary power toothbrushes are available with various modes of actions, bristle designs, and features. Clinical research shows these factors can impact the effectiveness of a toothbrush by altering its ability to remove plaque, particularly in areas that are difficult to access. An independent systematic review of power toothbrush technologies showed toothbrushes with a rotation-oscillation motion provided significant advantages over manual toothbrushes for plaque removal and gingivitis reduction. No other powered toothbrush technology showed results as consistently superior to manual toothbrushes. Conclusions: Recently, an advanced oscillating-rotating toothbrush was introduced, the Oral-B ® Triumph™ with SmartGuide ™ (Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, OH, USA), using clinically proven oscillating-rotating technology and incorporating a unique wireless remote display to <b>drive</b> good <b>brushing</b> technique and increase brushing time.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} study of the fully reversible assembly of oppositely charged colloidal particles in aqueous solutions. Our polystyrene colloids are charged by a grafted polyelectrolyte brush on their surface and stabilized at all salt concentrations by a neutral adsorbed polymer layer. Below a critical salt concentration oppositely charged colloids form clusters and gels with a fractal nature. The fractal dimension of those aggregates increases with increasing salt concentration. Above the critical salt concentration no aggregation takes place, due to the stabilizing neutral adsorbed polymer. Moreover, the aggregated structures are fully reversible and can be redispersed by simply increasing the salt concentration above the critical concentration. We confirm that time-dependent interaction forces are at {{the basis of the}} formation of clusters in the present system by atomic force microscopy measurements as a function of salt concentration and contact time.

40|$|With recent {{technological}} improvements, {{fabrication of}} integrated circuit elements on shrinking scales {{is required to}} meet the demand for massive storage and fast data processing. As the fabrication of high resolution patterns requires short wavelength radiation sources, extreme ultraviolet and electron beam techniques have been developed as radiation sources for next-generation lithography. Advancements of lithography techniques accompany the evolution of resist materials for the synchronous fulfillment of high sensitivity, high resolution, and high structural integrity. Our strategy for nanofabrication is a combination of bottom-up synthesis and top-down lithography. The use of cylindrical brush polymers, which can vertically align on substrates, affords access to electron-beam-generated patterns with the minimum pixel size determined by the cylinder diameter. Cylindrical brush polymers for negative- and positive-tone photoresist materials were synthesized by controlled radical and olefin metathesis polymerization. Macromonomers with well-defined size variations were prepared by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization of monomers having surface energy reducing, substrate adhesion enhancing, and lithographically functioning moieties. Then, sequential ring-opening metathesis polymerization of the macromonomers via a ?grafting-through? strategy allows precise control of concentric and lengthwise dimensions and compositions in the brush polymer structures. The brush polymers consist of a rigid polymeric backbone with covalently tethered side chains which allow facile access to a cylindrical morphology due to their steric repulsion. Low surface energy of fluoropolymers at one end and the high polarity of groups at the other end <b>drive</b> the cylindrical <b>brush</b> polymers to vertically align on the polar silicon wafer substrate as characterized by surface analysis techniques. The stretched conformation of the brush polymers facilitates their assembly by reducing chain entanglement. The chemically amplified resists from the brush polymers exhibit high lithographic performance with a few tens of nanometer resolution. The brush polymers with poly(p-hydroxystyrene) s yielded negative-tone features by crosslinking chemistry, while those having acid-labile tertiary esters gave positive-tone features. Cylindrical brush polymer based resists showed their superior lithographic performance over linear block copolymer precursors in both resolution and sensitivity by having each vertically aligned molecule act as a molecular pixel. As a result, the tuning of composition and dimension using bottom-up synthetic strategy allows the fine tuning of top-down lithographic performance.

50|$|In March 2014, Neato Robotics {{released}} an expanded model dubbed BotVac developed over several years, {{with a side}} brush previously available only on the limited distribution Vorwerk Kobold models in Germany (see below). BotVacs were initially priced about 20 {{percent higher than the}} older XV models. The new model featured additional major changes re-arranging the internal construction with larger filter area and dust bin, for less frequent servicing and covering larger premises, and the battery compacted into a single compartment instead of two separate compartments in the older models. The main front brush was made longer and closer to the wall, with a new more closely fitting bump sensor construction. Along with the side brush this cleans the margin against walls much more closely than the older models, which left a two inch wide strip untouched. The longer brush covers a wider swath of floor on each pass and the unit runs much quieter. The casing was modernized with more snap-fit fastenings and fewer screws. Internal electronics were upgraded and refined, and new commercial embedded systems operating system used. The <b>brush</b> <b>drive</b> belt was covered by a cowling with a new mounting method. A major improvement in efficiency was made with a lower voltage 10-cell 12v battery but higher in Ampere-Hours capacity than the older 12-cell battery, reflecting advances in battery manufacture over years. The battery remains NiMh compared to the Lithium battery used in Germany (and avoiding all hazard concerns with Lithium Ion batteries). However, the new Botvac Connected has a lithium battery. The BotVac is sold in several packages differing in accessories included such as extra filters and different brush types, same as the previous XV models were packaged.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the idle}} zone and/or high {{pressure}} arch (if applicable) is the friction zone. In the friction zone, {{a variety of}} brushes are used to clean all of the vehicle's surfaces. Wrap-around brushes (wraps) clean the front, sides, and rear of a car. A set of wraps consists of two offset brushes which are attached to overhead arms which are generally mounted over {{the center of the}} tunnel. Some wrap-around brush designs use jointed side-mounted arms to increase the brush's front and rear contact time. Wraps typically rotate with the vehicle's direction of travel. Some wrap-around brushes are capable of switching direction while cleaning the front of a car to prevent customers' license plates from being bent. Wraps are supplemented by side brushes (ranging in size from 18 inches cm up to 63 inches cm tall or higher). Side brushes may be either top or bottom mounted. To conserve space, side brushes are often staggered in the space occupied by a set of wraps or placed under top surface cleaning components, such as top brushes or mitters. Side brushes rotate against the vehicle's direction of travel to increase cleaning power. Top brushes are rotating brush assemblies which clean the vehicle's top surfaces. A top brush can face either the entrance or exit of the tunnel to assist in cleaning the car's front or rear. Some specialized top brushes are designed to achieve more contact time with the front or rear of vehicles. To prevent damage, a top brush can be programmed to retract if an ultrasonic pick-up truck bed detection system detects a pick-up truck with an open bed. In many car washes, top brushes are either supplemented by or replaced with mitters. Mitters are components which suspend cloth strips or sheets over the tunnel while utilizing motion to increase friction against the car's surface. A mitter's motion can be front to back, side to side, rotational, circular, or diagonal. The friction zone may also include specialized front grill and rear brushes. Front grill brushes clean the front, and in many cases, the sides of vehicles. They often appear as side washers with an unusually long and bent arm. Instead of bent arms, some front grill brushes use jointed arms. Like standard side washers, a grill brush may be either top or bottom <b>driven.</b> Rear <b>brushes</b> appear as a specialized tall side washers with long arms that face the entrance of the tunnel. Once a car's mirror passes a rear brush, the brush makes contact with the vehicle's side, where it then continues to engage until the assembly cleans the rear of the car. Additional high pressure components may also be present in the main friction zone.|$|R

Today's world, power converters, motor drivers, voltage regulators are have a very wide usage. From defence industry to home appliances, from automative to medical electronics, power electronic circuits are everywhere. Since power electronic devices have this popularity, their parameters like lifetime or efficiency become more important. Most of the people working on this field try to focus on improving the lifetime or efficiency of the power electronic circuits rather than inventing a new topology. Especially for home appliances industry, lifetime and efficiency of the system is very important because of the government regulations. For example, compressor motor and motor control circuit for a refridgator should have a very hig efficiency like  more than 90 %  to classify the system as a high-end product.   For the reasons above, brushless DC motors or permanent magnet synchronous motors are getting popular everyday. Since they have a good efficiency-torque-speed relationship, their usage in all industries are increasing rapidly. Although this motors are very efficient, they can not work directly with the AC mains. These kind of motors need a motor control circuit to operate and efficiency of this controller is also becomes important. Usually, BLDC or PMSM motors are producted as 3 -phase motors and so, they are controlled with a 3 -phase inverter circuit. A 3 -phase inverter circuit for controlling a motor usually has a harmonic eliminating circuit to obey the regulations. Then an AC to DC converter is used for gathering DC voltage from mains. After that, a six switch inverter is used for controlling the motor. Also there is a low voltage side for the microcontroller, integrated circuits and other peripheral components which is needed to gather the information from the motor and decide the next signal for inverter.  It is important to know the basic power electronics circuits topologies to understand how a six switch inverter controlls the motor in terms of speed or torque or both of them. Everything starts with a buck converter, which is used for decreasing the voltage value of the input and gives to the output. Buck circuit is a very simple circuit, just has one switch, one diode, one inductance and one capacitor.   Also boost converter is a main converter type, which increases the voltage of the input for the output. Boost converter is again very simple, has the same components with buck, just connected in a different way.   In todays power electronics world, most of the circuits derived from buck converter and boost converter. The most obvious example of that is the buc-boost converter. This converter type is used to increase or decrease the voltage, which is needed. Bridge type converters are the basics of motor control circuits. Simply, one can use a buck converter to <b>drive</b> a <b>brushed</b> DC motor, but only operates in one direction since the current flows only one direction. But in a bridge converter, current path can be changed so the direction of the rotation can be changed. That is the reason why the bridge type converters are important in motor control. These converters are based on buck converter, which means they decrease the input voltaage for the output. A half bridge converter includes two switches and two capacitors, whereas a full bridge converter includes four switches to have a perfect control on the current direction. A six switch inverter is based on the half bridge topology. Actually, it is nothing more than three half bridge converters. The middle points of the half brigde converters are connected to the load.   In a six switch inverter circuit which is used for a motor control, switches are the most important elements in terms of efficiency. Basicly, one can say that switches decide the efficiency level of the circuit. That is the reason why most of the scientists are working to increase the switching elements performance. There are a few ways to increase the switching performance, like using a new semiconductor technology or parallel switching. Superior semiconductors are the new era for electronics. Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Galium Nitride (GaN) are the most important technologies for today. Most of the semiconductor companies are trying to product a new, cheap and better superior semiconductors.   GaN is the main focus point of the companies. SiC technologies are complicated and expensive, but GaN production is easy and cheap. People in the industry says that procedure for production of the GaN may be cheaper than standard Silicone.  Many of the market predicters state that by the end of 2010 's GaN will replace the Si in semiconductors. A GaN switch has very good switching and conducting performance. To show this in this thesis, a Si based circuit and a GaN based circuit compared in terms of losses in calculation. After that, a motor control circuit is modified for GaN and new switches implemented. Than comparison re-done in the same load conditions, in terms of heating and losses. Results are given. Parallel switching is another way for increasing the efficiency of the circuit. Researchers are working on this technology since the early 90 's. Yirming Jiang, Guichao Hua and Fred C. Lee are the founders of the concept with their publication" which shows that it is possible to work with parallel switches. After this work, a lot of researchers worked on this topic and publicated their job. Sakhon Woothipatanapan, Anuwat Jangwanitlert and Phop Cancharoensook, show that a parallel switching method increases the efficiency on motor drives in their publication. This publication is the first in this field for 3 -phase implementation of the parallel switching method.   Parallel switching needs a very good gate driving circuit in terms of timing. Since a bad gate signal may cause a short circuit, designer must be very careful. For gate driving of parallel switches, there are not many offers.  People usually uses two microcontroller outputs for this. Bu it is not an efficient way for gate driving.   An ASIC can be a solution for gate drive timing. H. P. Yee, and Dean Liu published "An ASIC to Control the Paralleling of an IGBT with a MOSFET" article and designed an IC for closing time delay. There are some other methods like FPGA based design. But common problem is the high costs of new gate driving circuits. Cheap solutions can not provide opening delay which is important for switching losses. In this thesis, two RC based delay circuits are offered for opening delay and closing delay. Opening delay is for IGBT opening signal and closing delay is for MOSFET closing signal. By this way, IGBT never produces a switching loss ideally since it is under soft switching conditions. Also MOSFET never produces a conduction loss if it is selected correctly. At first, concept design of the circuits are made and explained. After that, switching elements are selected and delay times are desired. Than some calculation for delay times are done and values of the components are given.   Simulations are done on these designs via PSpice. It is shown that calculations and simulations are supporting each other. After that, a schematicof the circuit has designded and PCB has drawn.   With the real circuit, timing tests are done. A 200 kHz PWM is generated from a microcontroller and given to the delay circuits. Results are measured with a high speed-high resolution ossiloscope. In the end, it can be stated that, future of the power electronics lies in superior semiconductors. But since that time, parallel switching method is a good alternative for increasing the efficiency.

40|$|Tez (Yüksek Lisans) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2015 Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Mobil robotlar günümüzde tarım, mayın tarama, askeri uygulamalar, uzay araştırmaları ve insanların erişemediği veya nükleer santraller gibi insanlara zararlı ortamlarda kullanılmaktadırlar. Ancak bu robotların bazıları bir operatörden bağımsız olarak, diğer bir deyişle otonom olarak çalışmaktadırlar. Dünyada çeşitli alanlarda kullanılmak üzere otonom robot geliştirmek için bir yarış vardır.   Bu tezde çeşitli alanlarda kullanılmak üzere (öncelikli olarak tarım alanında) otonom robot ve kontrol ünitesi tasarlanmıştır ve gerçekleştirilmiştir. Projede tasarım yapılırken modülerlik, düşük maliyet, yerli üretime katkı, çevre şartlarına uygunluk ve özgünlük özelliklerine sahip bir robot tasarlanmaya çalışılmıştır. Robotun kontrol ünitesinin robotun taşıyıcı {{platform}}undan bağımsız olmasına dikkat edilmiştir. Çünkü projede kullanılan platformun amaca ve kullanılacağı araziye uygun olarak değiştirilebilmesi istenmektedir.   Tasarlanan kontrol ünitesi içinde batarya kontrol sistemi, bütün sensör verilerini işleyen, diğer kartlarla haberleşen ve robotun motorlarını süren bir anakart ve görüntü işleme görevlerini yerine getirebilecek olan bir mini bilgisayar bulunmaktadır. Anakart açı ve konum sensörleri, mesafe sensörleri, tekerlek hızını ölçen sensörler ve diğer kartlardan bilgiler alarak robotun tekerleklerini motor sürücü vasıtasıyla sürmektedir. Robot platformu altı tekerlek ve alüminyum bir iskeletten oluşmaktadır. Her tekerlek ayrı bir motor tarafından sürülmektedir. Robot kızaklı yönlendirme metodunu kullanarak hareket etmektedir. Yani robotun sağ üç motoru ayrı, sol üç motoru ayrı kontrol edilmektedir. Kızaklı yönlendirme metodu, diferansiyel yönlendirme metoduna çok benzemektedir. Robotun küçük ve modüler olması istendiği için robot tasarımı üç ayrı seviye halinde yapılmıştır. Bu seviyeler sırasıyla gövde seviyesi, kontrol birimi seviyesi ve ek birimler seviyesidir. Gövde seviyesinde robotun iskeleti, motorları ve bataryaları bulunmaktadır. Gövde seviyesine araç geliştirilirken değişiklik yapılması istenmeyen parçalar yerleştirilmiştir. Ayrıca gövde seviyesi, platforma özgü bir seviyedir. Gövde seviyesi paletli, dört tekerlekli, altı tekerlekli bir platform olabilir. Hatta diferansiyel yönlendirme ile kontrol edilebilen bir deniz aracı bile olabilir. Kontrol birimi seviyesinde, robot için tasarlanmış olan kontrol ünitesi bulunmaktadır. Kontrol birimi seviyesi için kısaca robotun beyni denilebilir. Ek birimler seviyesinde ise amaca uygun parçalar bulunmaktadır. Örneğin, aracın açık arazilerde otonom hareket etmesi istendiği için ek birimler seviyesine açı ve konum sensörleri eklenmiştir. Ek birimler seviyesi, gelecekte robota dâhil edilebilecek birimlerin ekleneceği seviye olarak tasarlanmıştır. Sonuç olarak, çeşitli amaçlara uygun olan bir otonom mobil robot ve kontrol ünitesi tasarlanmış ve gerçekleştirilmiştir. Şu anda robot manuel kontrol ve merkez ile haberleşme görevlerini yerine getirmektedir. İlerleyen çalışmalarda görüntü işleme ve kontrol yöntemleri uygulanarak robotun otonom hareket etmesi sağlanacaktır. Robotun ilk olarak tarım alanlarındaki ürün sıraları arasında otonom hareket edebilmesi için açı, konum ve mesafe sensörlerinden aldığı bilgileri, görüntü işleme kartından gelen bilgiler ile birleştirmesi hedeflenmektedir. Mobile robots {{are used}} at agriculture, land mine searching and disarming, military, space explorations, and other applications where {{the environment is}} dangerous or inaccessible to human. In some of these applications, robots perform tasks autonomously. These robots are called autonomous robots. Today in the World, there is race to develop autonomous robot in diversity of fields. In this thesis, an autonomous robot and its control unit {{are designed to be}} used in various fields (especially in agriculture). At the design stage, aim is to create a robot that is modular, low–cost to manifacture, contributing to domestic production, suitable against environmental conditions and original. Control unit of robot has been noted to be independent from the carrier platform. Because it is desired to change robot platform according to intended use and environmental conditions. Designed control unit consists of battery management system, main board and beaglebone (a mini computer board). In every vehicle, robot or electronic device that powered by Lithium Polymer (LiPo), or similar chemistry batteries must be used with battery management system. Because these battery types have operating voltage, current and temperature range. Out side of this operating range can be dangerous or could result battery death. For example, if LiPo battery is overheated because of high current drawn, it may be explode or burn. Another example, if battery is overdrained, it may die and never work again. To avoid these situations battery pack must be monitored all time.   In this thesis, battery management system is implemented on power board. Power board has ARM Cortex – M 3 processor powered LPC 1343 micro controller unit. MCU monitors battery voltages, battery temperatures and current that drawn by other parts of robot. Power board always monitors battery state and sends monitored data to mainboard. Power board also controls separated charger. Beacause of limited time, power board only controls connection between charger and battery pack. If input voltage, which comes externally to robot, is sufficient, then power board connects charger to battery. In future, charge operations will be implemented on power board. Another part of control unit is main board. Main board acts as the brain of the robot. Main board reads all sensors’ data, communicates with station, angle and position sensors board, power board and beaglebone, and controls the motors via the motor driver board according to calculations. Main board has ARM Cortex – M 3 processor powered LPC 1769 MCU. This MCU is faster and has more peripheral than power board’s MCU.   Robot platform consists of an aluminium chassis on six wheels. Three wheels on the right and left. Every wheel is <b>driven</b> by one <b>brushed</b> dc motor. <b>Drive</b> method of robot is skid – steering method. Skid – steering is very similar to differential drive. In short, main board separately controls the three motors on the left and the three motors on the right to steer robot. Advantages of skid – steering method is less moving parts means there is no explicit steering mechanism and this method has more traction. Disadvantages are straight – line travel can be difficult to achieve and skidding cause wheels to lose contact with the ground, which means odometry sensors, cannot accurately track the position of the vehicle. In addition, robot platform has suspensions at every wheel and wheels are suitable for field conditions. As described earlier, control unit was designed independently from robot platform. This means control unit can drive any skid-steering vehicle and any type of control algorithm can be implemented on control unit. Main board gathers data from eight distance sensors, two quadrature encoder sensors, angle and position sensors, power board, beaglebone and station via wireless communicaiton board. Also sends data and last state to station. Distance sensors are placed to cover every side of the robot. Distance sensors are used for environment awareness and collision avoidance. These sensors use soundwaves to measure distance. To prevent interference between sensors, all sensors are used in chain algorithm. Quadrature encoders are attached to middle left and middle right motors to implement PID control with using feedback. By using PID control, motors on the left and right side can be driven more accurately.   Angle and positions sensors board consists of three parts. First one is inertial measuring unit (IMU) sensors board. IMU board has three axis gyroscope, three axis accelerometer and three axis magnetometer chips. Position sensor is well – known global positioning system (GPS), which finds longitude and latitude of robots position. Third part is MCU board. On this board there is a ATMEGA 328 P MCU, which can be programmed by Arduino. MCU board gathers data from IMU and uses sensor fusion algorithm to find Euler angles of robot, encodes GPS sensor packets to find position, and sends these gathered and calculated data to main board. There is a many IMU and GPS applications and programs on the internet. In thesis, these programs are adjusted for the IMU and GPS chips. Also some filter algorithm are implemented to get more stable values.   Main board and power board MCU’s are programmed from register level to system level. These MCU’s programmed from low level to use MCU’s at high speed, efficient and gain control of program at any level. For both MCU, peripheral libraries are created or pre-built libraries are reprogrammed.   Last part of the control unit is beaglebone black board. This board is mini computer. This board added to control unit because of image processing tasks. But image processing will be implemented in the future.   Hardware design of robot is performed in three levels. Because, one of the design criteria was modularity and there was too many parts. This levels are body level, control unit level and additional units level. Body level consists of robot chasis, motors, batteries and some sensors. Parts in the body level are stationary and unique to robot platform. Control unit level act as a brain of robot. Control unit level is detechable, so that changes can be made. Additional unitss level was designed application specific. Angle and position sensors board, live video transmitter, charger and cameras for image processing are added to additional units level. Every level connected to each other by power or signal cables.   Now, robot can be controlled manually from station. In manual control operator sends directions to robot from station by using joystick or keyboard. Robot calculates movement according to operator directions and sensor data. First autonomous application of robot will be IMU and GPS controlled movement at open fields. This section is prepared, but not tested.   As a result low-cost and modular robot and control unit was designed and implemented. In the first stage, project goal was design a robot which acts as a development platform. Next stage of the work will be implement control algorithms or methods, such as sliding mode control or fuzzy logic control methods on control unit. Also image processing capabilities will be added to robot. The robot is initially intended to be used to collect data in the fields of agriculture. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
