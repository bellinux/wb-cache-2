One hundred and twelve pregnant women with and without anaemia were enrolled in the study at the antenatal clinic of the hospital.

40|$|Background. <b>Intestinal</b> {{parasitic}} <b>infestations</b> pose one of {{the biggest}} health problems of the contemporary world. Objectives. The aim of this article was to present the prevalence of intestinal parasites among children living in a large urban agglomeration. Material and methods. 1823 children (916 girls and 907 boys), aged 3 – 6, attending 31 different pre-schools in Warsaw, were examined in 2014. Stool specimens were tested in the Department of Epidemiology and Tropical Medicine of the Military Institute of Medicine by light microscopy using three different diagnostic methods (direct smear in Lugol’s solution, decantation with distilled water, Fülleborn’s flotation). The material for testing, fixed in 10 % formalin, was collected three times at 2 – 3 -day intervals. Results. Parasitological examination of the stool specimens showed <b>intestinal</b> parasitic <b>infestations</b> in 47 children (2. 57 % of the study group). Only 7 children were infested with pathogenic parasites (6 cases of giardiasis and 1 enterobiasis) and required antiparasitic treatment. 17 children were infested with potentially pathogenic protozoa (Blasocystis sp.) and 26 with non-pathogenic protozoa (Entamoeba coli, Endolimax nanai), but because of lack of gastrointestinal symptoms (asymptomatic carriage) they did not require a treatment. Conclusions. Performed examination show low infection rates among children from a large urban agglomeration. In the absence of epidemiological surveillance over the prevalence of the majority of intestinal parasitic diseases in Poland, and because some diagnostic centres generate positive test results using valueless methods, the propagation of parasitological diagnostics in light microscopy in direction of prevalence of <b>intestinal</b> parasitic <b>infestations,</b> especially among patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, is strongly recommended...|$|R

In an effort to understand the host-parasite interaction to acquired immunity to H. nana infection, studies were conducted to investigate the types of immune responses elicited by 5 - 10 week-old male mice repeatedly infected with low-dose level of H. nana eggs. The results revealed that the immunized host is capable of mounting a measurable immune response attributable to the cumulative antigenic stimulation which sensitized the immunocompetent cells. It is noteworthy that the elimination of challenge infection occurred to an equal extent in all the immunized groups, regardless of the size of immunisation. The failure of the challenge oncospheres to penetrate the intestinal mucosa of immunized hosts might be a result of the local hypersensitivity reaction occurring in situ due to {{the increase in the number}} of eosinophils.

Four species each of helminthes and protozoan parasites and three species of coccidian parasites were isolated from the stool of both HIV-seropositive and seronegative subjects. The prevalence of these parasites was two and a halve times higher among the HIV seropositive patients than the seronegative ones.

Computed tomography (CT) was done in 15 of these 37 patients; the attenuation of the stones was found to be only slightly above that of liver. The evidence that Ascaris lumbricoides was the cause of IH stones in our patients was that: they came mainly from communities in which A. lumbricoides infestation is virtually universal at some stage of childhood, and none from communities in which it is infrequent; their average age was younger than that of patients with conventional gall-stones, fitting with the fact that infestation is predominantly in childhood; A. lumbricoides is the only parasite in our region that invades the biliary system; the histories of the first 12 of the 37 patients had been investigated for <b>intestinal</b> <b>infestation,</b> and were all positive; and 12 of the 37 showed evidence at some time of roundworms or remnants in the biliary system, either within the US appearance of the stones ('bundles' and 'pipes') or separately on US, surgery or duodenoscopy.
