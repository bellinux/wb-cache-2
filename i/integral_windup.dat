Because of the <b>integral</b> (reset) <b>windup,</b> however, delay or overshoot sometimes occurred in feedback FES control, which was considered to cause inappropriate ANN learning and to limit the feasibility of the FEL controller for FES to controlling 1 -DOF movements stimulating 2 muscles. In this paper, an FEL-FES controller was developed applying antireset windup (ARW) scheme that worked based on total controller output. The FEL-FES controller with the ARW was examined in controlling 2 -DOF movements of the wrist joint stimulating 4 muscles through computer simulation.

50|$|<b>Integral</b> <b>windup,</b> {{also known}} as {{integrator}} windup or reset windup, refers {{to the situation in}} a PID feedback controller where a large change in setpoint occurs (say a positive change) and the integral terms accumulates a significant error during the rise (windup), thus overshooting and continuing to increase as this accumulated error is unwound (offset by errors in the other direction). The specific problem is the excess overshooting.|$|E
50|$|<b>Integral</b> <b>windup</b> {{particularly}} {{occurs as}} {{a limitation of}} physical systems, compared with ideal systems, due to the ideal output being physically impossible (process saturation: {{the output of the}} process being limited at the top or bottom of its scale, making the error constant). For example, the position of a valve cannot be any more open than fully open and also cannot be closed any more than fully closed. In this case anti-windup can actually involve the integrator being turned off for periods of time until the response falls back into an acceptable range.|$|E

A SIMULINK model was obtained to implement Back calculation combined with Conditional Integration.

But the traditional PI controller has characteristic of nonlinear saturation, what {{will make the}} control performance of actual system become worse. In order to improve system control performance, this paper adopts a new type Anti-Windup PI controller, This method separately control the integral state by feed backing {{the output of the}} integrator to the input port of the integrator according to whether the controller output is saturated or not, which can make the system leaving saturation as soon as possible. As a result, the overshoot and settling time of the system are reduced. Simulation and experimental results show that this method can significantly suppress the <b>integral</b> <b>windup</b> phenomenon as well as reduce the overshoot and shorten the settling time.

All the controllers have the same three terms gains, but the ith controller operates on the future error signal at time (t+i). A known future set point and dead time can be easily incorporated and the input constraints can be handled via the solution of constrained MPC problem or <b>integral</b> <b>windup</b> techniques. The stability of the closed loop system is studied and the optimal values of PID gains are derived.

40|$|Abstract—The {{most common}} type of {{controller}} being used in the industry is PI(D) controller which has been used since 1945 and is still being widely used due to its efficiency and simplicity. In most cases, the PI(D) controller was tuned without taking into consideration of the effect of actuator saturation. In real processes, the most common actuator which is valve will act as constraint and restrict the controller output. Since the controller is not designed to encounter saturation, the process may windup and consequently resulted in large oscillation or may become unstable. Usually, an antiwindup compensator is added to the feedback control loop to reduce the deterioration effect of <b>integral</b> <b>windup.</b> This research aims to specifically control processes with constraints. The proposed method was applied to two different types of food processes, which are blending and spray drying. Simulations were done using MATLAB and the performances of the proposed method were compared with other conventional methods. The proposed technique was able to control the processes and avoid saturation such that no anti windup compensator is needed.

40|$|Feedback {{control system}} with PID Controller is an {{important}} technique that is widely used in the process industries. Their main advantage is that corrective action occurs {{as soon as the}} controlled variable deviates from the set point, regardless of the source and type of disturbance. Again if process conditions change, retuning the controller usually produces satisfactory control. The degree of convergence of the output waveform of PID controller is depending upon proper tuning of the controller. In this paper the control parameters (KP, KI, KD) of a PID controller are tuned to their optimum value. The controller algorithm is simulated by using LabVIEW (G language) software and usefulness of this controller for controlling different process variables is studied using proper tuning. The designed virtual instrument includes all the necessary components and facilities necessary for PID controller to function properly and to control any linear process. All the issues related to <b>integral</b> <b>windup,</b> derivative overrun, output signal limits and sampling interval ∆t are well considered. The created Sub VI program may be used as a controller in a closed loop which is able to control a process. ...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we {{successfully}} developed {{a model of}} a two link, 3 D flexible manipulator, linearized it before developing an inverse model. The inverse model was augmented with order n = 2 filter and used as a feedforward controller. The filter and the inverse model were integrated in an already existing Matlab model and the experiments carried out in dSPACE control environment. Comparing with a system without the inverse controller, the results presented show a significant reduction of the link vibration while closely tracking the desired joint angles as facilitated by the inverse controller. We found that the links velocities were dependent on the value of the filter time constant λ whose careful choice could yield high operation speeds and minimal link vibrations. The contribution of this article is the development of a filter augmented inverse controller and the application of this controller in vibration control akin to input shaping technique. The merit of this technique is that the trajectory is not fixed like in classical input shaping methods. Except for disturbance handling capabilities, the filtered inverse controller is simple to implement and accurate without the known limitations affecting other methods like PID, i.e. <b>integral</b> <b>windup</b> and high frequency noise amplification. To improve on the disturbance handling capabilities of the filtered inverse controller, this work can be extended to internal model control (IMC) system.|$|E
40|$|The {{examples}} of controls in a high-precision scientific laboratory are countless and most scientific applications rely on controls {{of the powerful}} proportional-integral-derivative (PID), first introduced by Minorsky in 1922. In recent years a novel Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) has been proposed. The ADRC is a linear, simple, intuitive, and inherently robust form of control. It {{is based on a}} linear extended state observer (LESO) that estimates and compensates the disturbance of the system in real time with a certain bandwidth. The bandwidths of the control and of the observer are the only parameters needed for tuning. The design of the ADRC is model independent and requires only some approximate knowledge of the fast frequency response of the system. We applied the ADRC to the stabilization of the temperature of optical ultra-stable cavities. Such cavities are used for laser frequency stabilization for high-resolution spectroscopy and in optical clocks. In our case a 578 nm yellow laser is locked to the cavities and it will be used for the spectroscopy of ytterbium atoms. The temperature of the cavities has to be stabilized to prevent drift in their length and thus in the frequency of the laser. We will present the details of the ADRC and show the performance of the temperature stabilization. The ADRC shows attractive features that motivates our choice: it is easy to design and to implement digitally, insensitive to environmental changes, and avoids typical problems encountered with PID like overshoots and <b>integral</b> <b>windup...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{real-time}} dynamic {{feedback control}} system is developed. An improved PID algorithm, called the integral separated piecewise PID scheme, {{is used in the}} control system. This algorithm is able to limit the contribution of the integral component in the PID calculation to avoid <b>integral</b> <b>windup.</b> In addition, it could use different PID parameters to adapt to different segments within one punch motion cycle. Hence, the error of the punch motion, either resulting from the machine assembly or from the machine dynamics, can be compensated by tuning the velocity of the servomotor. This is a unique feature of the new press that ensures its accuracy. Based on the novel structure, the detailed design is then carried out, which includes the mechanical design, kinematics and inverse kinematics analysis, static force analysis, parametric design and the other related designs. A calibration method based on the experiment and computer simulation is proposed for the new press, which is also useful for the parallel mechanisms. Cooperated with Guangdong Metal Forming Machine Works Co. Ltd., a 250 KN prototype has been built and tested. In order to ensure the desirable performance, dynamic control is necessary. The thesis uses two dynamic modeling methods to study the dynamics of the press. One is the kineto-static method. It is also called D'Alembert principle which rearranges Newton's second law and transfers a dynamic problem to an equivalent static problem by adding the inertial forces and inertial torques onto the system. The model can then be analyzed easily and exactly as a static system subjected to the inertial forces and torques and the external forces. The other method is the Lagrangian method which derives the dynamic model from the energy perspective. Based on the model, the dynamics of the press is studied by means of computer simulation and is validated experimentally. In this thesis, a controllable hybrid mechanical metal forming press is developed, which is driven by a CSM with a flywheel and a servomotor. From a mechanism point of view, it is a closed-loop 2 -DOF parallel planar five-bar mechanism with four resolute joints and one prismatic joint. Thanks to the usage of the servomotor, the punch motion of the new press can be controlled by tuning the velocity of the servomotor. Accordingly, desired punch motions for different stamping processes can be obtained. In other words, the new press is flexible and controllable like the servo mechanical press and the hydraulic press. Moreover, the CSM with flywheel provides the main power during the stamping operation, and hence, it is energy efficient. In addition, it is not expensive to build, as it uses only a small servomotor. Metal forming {{is one of the oldest}} production processes and yet, is still one of the most commonly used processes today. Everyday, millions of parts are produced by metal forming ranging from battery caps to automobile body panels. Therefore, even a small improvement may add to significant corporative gain. The thesis also describes the trajectory planning method for the press, which is based on the combination of the inverse kinematics and cubic spline interpolation. The trajectory is optimized under multiple constraints on velocity, acceleration and jerk of the servomotor. It guarantees the new press is controllable and energy efficient. Two typical stamping processes, drawing and forging, are taken as examples for the operations of the new press. The results of the simulation and the experiment match well. Based on the simulation and experiments, it is found that the CSM provides the main power for the metal forming operations, while the servomotor is mainly responsible for overcoming the inertia forces to realize the desired punch motion. The experiments show that the new press is energy efficient, fast, controllable and inexpensive to build. It combines the advantages of both mechanical press and hydraulic press and has a good performance. It is expected the new press will have a great potential for the metal forming industry.
