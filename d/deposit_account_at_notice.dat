When the treasuries fluctuated in value, banks had to recall loans or borrow from other banks or clearinghouses. The second problem was that the system created seasonal liquidity spikes.

When combined liquidity demands were too big, the bank again had to find a lender of last resort.|$|R

The author describes characteristics of savings behavior of Ukrainian citizens {{during the period of}} financial crisis. According to data of the “Tsentr” analytical group opinion poll (2009), the structure of population’s savings preferences has not gone through noticeable changes. Obtaining a positive savings experience as bank institu tions clients, people keep on considering such form of money savings as the best one. Even the fact that accounts of many Ukrainian depositors have been frozen at some credit and savings banks found on verge of bankruptcy did not ward them off. In such a case, people are disappointed rather in a concrete bank agency than in a hole banking system. The impacts which can attract the population’s deposit money to problematical banks after their “sanation” are also studied in the article. The author carries out an operational classification of motivational structure of population’s deposit activity. In particular, the deposit savings of population can serve not only as the mean of resolving both current and future financial problems, but as a kind of stabilizing factor regarding social and psychological state of a concrete person...|$|R

30|$|The {{main line}} of inquiry, in this context, is the {{analysis}} of the elasticity of the demand for currency to nominal interest rates. As noted by Attanasio et al. (2002) interest rates on deposits and the demand for currency overall display a remarkable degree of regional variation that can be exploited to estimate the relevant elasticity of currency. To our knowledge, these studies have not considered either the effects of debit and/or credit POS transactions or the interaction between ATM and POS transactions in the demand for currency. 9 In order to achieve this goal, our dataset is transformed into a regional dataset. In particular, in a first step, the demand for currency, deposit interest rates and nondurable consumption in Eq. (4) are computed as weighted averages of the different banks in that region using the distribution of assets as a weighting factor. In a second stage, these variables are re-computed at the consumer level as ratios of the number of depositors of the banks operating in these territories. 10 Since the available data only permit to analyze consumers holding <b>deposits</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>at</b> each bank, our estimations of the demand for currency are restricted to depositors while non-depositors are not considered. 11 Additionally, when averaging the variables we assume that, on average, all depositors make both ATM and debit and credit POS transactions. As we are analyzing the effects of ATM and POS transaction volumes at the regional level, we do not distinguish between the issuer and the acquirer sides as we are focusing on the aggregate effect. The variables are computed on an annual basis for the 17 administrative regions in Spain which yields 187 panel observations.|$|R

The bank itself {{was nothing new}} as it was simply an imitation of the successful public deposit banks of Amsterdam and Hamburg, however Palmstruch himself added two important innovations. The first of these was to use money <b>deposited</b> into <b>accounts</b> <b>at</b> the bank to finance loans, however this soon became a problem as the deposits were usually short-term and the loans long-term, meaning that deposited money was unavailable to be withdrawn by account holders. Palmstruch's second innovation, and his solution to this problem, was the introduction in 1661 of Kreditivsedlar ("credit paper"), the first European banknotes, which would be exchangeable at any time for the gold and silver coins they were replacing. [...] These were very successful, but the bank began lending more than it could afford and printed too many banknotes without the necessary collateral, leading to the bank's collapse in 1668.|$|R
