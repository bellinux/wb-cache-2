5|$|Although {{precursors}} to {{this table}} exist, its invention is generally credited to Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Mendeleev invented {{the table to}} illustrate recurring ("periodic") trends in {{the properties of the}} elements.

5|$|In 64 BCE, the {{military}} expedition of the Roman general Pompey {{put an end}} to the anarchy prevailing in the Seleucid Empire, and Phoenicia became part of the Roman world. But Roman civil wars continued to disrupt the region until 31 BCE, after which, with the reign of Augustus, the pax romana <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> the area. The pax romana favored international trade, and local industries in silversmithing, glass, textiles and ceramics developed.|$|E

Almost all were poor, and housed in overcrowded and insanitary conditions. Lang knew something of the area from his undergraduate activities at Toynbee Hall, and his conscience was troubled by the squalor that he saw as he travelled around the district, usually by bus and tram.|$|E
5|$|Modern SR410 was {{parts of}} various state wagon roads until 1926 when US410 was established, {{extending}} from Aberdeen to Lewiston, Idaho. US410 was decommissioned after US12 was <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> {{the majority of}} the highway in 1967, bypassing Olympia and Chinook Pass. A segment of former US410 from Elma to Olympia became SR8 and the Tacoma to Naches segment became SR410. The highway was later shortened to end in Sumner and was replaced by SR167 from Tacoma to Sumner.|$|E

After December 1908 these services terminated at Earl's Court. The locomotives {{were used to}} haul District trains, one coupled to each end of a rake of four trailer cars. From 1910 the locomotives were used on London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT) trains <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> the District line, taking over from steam locomotives at Barking.|$|E
5|$|Trapping {{of newly}} emerged insects: By sealing the storage facilities, newly emerged adults from seeds could be {{prevented}} from escaping to their overwintering sites {{to decrease the}} pest pressure at the next season. B. rufimanus could then be trapped and later killed, e.g., by fire. Healthy and damaged seeds can be sorted using an optic sorter. Additionally, a storage <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> two years enables all developing B. rufimanus to emerge before sowing and therefore avoids emergence in the field from contaminated seeds.|$|E
5|$|A pupil {{like myself}} had {{to submit to}} Balakirev a {{proposed}} composition in its embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try {{hard to make the}} author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> {{a long period of time}} under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, MD410 was {{extended}} even further east and saw significant improvement on its extant sections. By 1946, MD410 was <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> Ager Road, Hamilton Street, 38th Avenue, and Jefferson Avenue, roads then designated MD209, {{to a new}} eastern terminus at US 1 in Hyattsville. In addition, the pre-1946 course saw completion of efforts to widen the road to 40 feet. The highway between Connecticut Avenue (then MD193) and Georgia Avenue (US29) was widened in 1946 and 1947. The two segments between Wisconsin Avenue (US 240) and Connecticut Avenue (MD193) and between MD650 in Takoma Park and US1 in Hyattsville were widened in 1950.|$|E

5|$|By 1978, the {{frontage}} roads between Five Mile Line Road and NY250 in Webster were completed. NY104 was rerouted eastward {{along the}} roadways while NY404 was <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> NY104's old alignment to NY250 in Webster. The section from NY250 {{to the existing}} expressway at the Wayne County line {{was built in the}} late 1970s while the main carriageway of NY104 between Five Mile Line Road and NY250 was completed in the early 1980s. NY404 was extended east along the former alignment of NY104 to the county line upon the total completion of the Five Mile Line Road–NY250 segment.|$|E

In 1847 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert travelled through Fleetwood {{on their way to}} London from Scotland, but that year saw the decline of the town's importance on the route to Scotland. More powerful locomotives were now able to travel over hilly terrain, and the railway was <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> Shap Fell all the way to Scotland; Fleetwood was no longer needed as a sea link.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 {{with the}} {{extension}} of the US131 freeway west of Big Rapids to the interchange with 19Mile Road, the former route of US131 through Big Rapids on State Street and Northland Drive north of Perry Street was designated as a business loop, using M-20 (Perry Street) to connect back to the freeway on the southern end. At the time, 19Mile Road between the freeway Northland Drive was used by the mainline to connect to its pre-existing routing north of Big Rapids to Reed City. The US131 freeway was completed north of 19 Mile Road in 1986, and Bus. US131 was <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> the 19 Mile Road portion of US131 to connect with its parent route at exit 142 northwest of Big Rapids.|$|E
5|$|In a 1983 study, R. J. Kaufmann {{suggests}} that Shaw {{was a key}} forerunner—"godfather, if not actually finicky paterfamilias"—of the Theatre of the Absurd. Two further aspects of Shaw's theatrical legacy are noted by Crawford: his opposition to stage censorship, which was finally ended in 1968, and his efforts which <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> many years to establish a National Theatre. Shaw's short 1910 play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets, in which Shakespeare pleads with Queen Elizabeth I for the endowment of a state theatre, was part of this campaign.|$|E

5|$|NY424 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It went unchanged until April1, 1980, when ownership and maintenance of the route was transferred from the state of New York to Chautauqua County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The other routes given to the county were the portion of NY380 between NY424 and U.S. Route20 (US20), the entirety of NY428, and two reference routes in Dunkirk and Fredonia. In return, the state assumed control of NY394 between NY5 and US20, US62 from NY394 to NY60, and Forest Avenue south of Jamestown. The NY424 designation was officially removed on August7, 1980, and its former routing is now part of CR58, which was <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> the length of the state highway.|$|E
5|$|The I-75/US10/US23 freeway was {{completed}} between Saginaw and Bay City in late 1960 or early 1961; M-47 was relocated {{to the former}} US10 between Saginaw and Midland, and M-84 was redesignated along the former M-47 between M-81 at Saginaw and the freeway in Bay City. A new BL I-75 was created {{at the same time}} along the former M-47 in Bay City. This business loop would be split in half in 1971 resulting in a new business spur; M-84 was <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> the southern section between M-25 and I-75/US10/US 23.|$|E
5|$|The burial {{practices}} of the archbishops did change after Cuthbert, {{but it is not}} clear whether this was intended by Cuthbert, as a Post-Conquest Canterbury cartulary has it, or due to other reasons, unconnected with Cuthbert. Although Sonia Hawkes argues that the change in burial customs, which <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> most of Britain, resulted from Cuthbert's mandating burial in church yards, instead of outside the city limits as had been the custom previously. However, the main evidence for this theory is a 16th-century tradition at Canterbury and the archaeological evidence of a change in burial patterns. Although a change did occur, the archaeological evidence does not give a reason why this change happened, and given the late date of the Canterbury tradition, the theory cannot be considered proven.|$|E
