5|$|Tanguay is {{best known}} for his playmaking skills and ability to set his {{teammates}} up for scoring opportunities. His speed and passing skills are considered <b>his</b> <b>strongest</b> attributes. Calgary teammates Olli Jokinen and Jarome Iginla both praised his ability to find a way to pass the puck to them in difficult plays.|$|E
5|$|Carruthers is left-footed and is versatile, {{being able}} to play as a left back, left wing-back and left midfielder, {{although}} he has stated <b>his</b> <b>strongest</b> position is at left back. He has also played in a more attacking role as a left winger. He predominantly played as a left back for Northampton and Bristol Rovers, but on his arrival at York he was converted to playing in left midfield.|$|E
50|$|Sobolewicz {{attributes}} {{his survival}} mainly to sheer luck and coincidence, {{as so many}} of his comrades perished along the way, but also to <b>his</b> <b>strong</b> will to survive, the help of God, <b>his</b> <b>strong</b> desire to reunite with his mother and family, and <b>his</b> <b>strong</b> desire to bear witness to the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany, in the hope that they may never be repeated.|$|R

5|$|Nevin in 2002 played first base, {{which was}} {{considered}} <b>his</b> <b>strongest</b> defensive position. But injuries shortened his 2002 and 2003 seasons. In 2002, he missed {{time with a}} strained left elbow. Three games after returning from the elbow injury, he broke his arm diving for a ground ball, causing him to miss another six weeks. After being heckled by a fan during a September 2002 game, Nevin gave the fan the finger, for which he apologized.|$|E
5|$|Rivalry between Brooks and Clayton predated the 1868 election. Clayton saw Brooks as <b>his</b> <b>strongest</b> {{competitor}} for {{preference and}} distinction {{and did not}} want him to become too entrenched with the party leadership. Brooks felt that his ability and service to the party were not being recognized or appreciated, and he grew bitter and resentful of the other Republicans, including Clayton.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Queen Tripurasundari in 1832, <b>his</b> <b>strongest</b> supporter, and the {{adulthood}} of King Rajendra, weakened {{his hold on}} power. The conspiracies and infighting with rival courtiers (especially the Pandes, who held Bhimsen Thapa {{responsible for the death}} of Damodar Pande in 1804) finally led to his imprisonment and death by suicide in 1839. However, the court infighting did not subside with his death, and the political instability eventually paved way for the establishment of the Rana dynasty.|$|E
50|$|He started 2010-11 in fine form, and <b>his</b> <b>strong</b> {{performances}} in November 2010 saw him {{nominated for the}} League Two player of the month award. <b>His</b> <b>strong</b> performances continued throughout the season, and he was rewarded with the club's Player of the Year award.|$|R

5|$|Edler {{plays in}} the style of an {{offensive}} defenseman. One of <b>his</b> <b>strongest</b> offensive assets is his slapshot. At the Canucks' 2008 SuperSkills event, he beat the team's reigning hardest shooter, Sami Salo, with a 99.3 mile-per-hour shot and has gone on to win the competition in 2009 and 2010, as well. He is also known for his poise and confidence with the puck, allowing him to make strong first passes out of the defensive zone to forwards. Many within the Canucks organization, such as Assistant Coach Rick Bowness, have asserted this as a reflection of his calm off-ice demeanor.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{opposed the}} {{military}} escalation {{in response to}} {{events such as the}} Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs invasion, but <b>his</b> <b>strongest</b> opposition was to U.S. involvement in South Vietnam. His opposition grew in strength after he retired from the military in 1963; he was hostile to both the strategy of the conflict and the excessive influence of corporations and military officials upon foreign policy. His high-profile criticism later spread to include the military industrial complex and what he saw as a pervasive militarism in American culture. Historians consider Shoup's statements opposing the war to be among the most pointed and high-profile leveled by a veteran against the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, {{which was}} {{by that point}} {{pursuing}} the British battlecruisers, had not yet encountered the Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his ships to torpedo boat attack. He had not yet made a decision when his leading battleships encountered {{the main body of}} the Grand Fleet. This development made it impossible for Scheer to retreat, for doing so would have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron, while using his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat would have subjected <b>his</b> <b>strongest</b> ships to overwhelming British fire. Instead, Scheer ordered his ships to turn 16 points to starboard, which would bring the pre-dreadnoughts to the relative safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line.|$|E

5|$|Ida {{insisted that}} McKinley {{continue}} his increasingly successful career {{in law and}} politics. He attended the state Republican convention that nominated Hayes for a third term as governor in 1875, and campaigned again for his old friend in the election that fall. The next year, McKinley undertook a high-profile case defending a group of coal miners arrested for rioting after a clash with strikebreakers. Lynch, McKinley's opponent in the 1871 election, and his partner, William R. Day, were the opposing counsel, and the mine owners included Mark Hanna, a Cleveland businessman. Taking the case pro bono, he was successful in getting {{all but one of}} the miners acquitted. The case raised McKinley's standing among laborers, a crucial part of the Stark County electorate, and also introduced him to Hanna, who would become <b>his</b> <b>strongest</b> backer in years to come.|$|E
5|$|In December 1996, Patton {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to consider the}} issue of worker's compensation reform. Both Patton and the state's legislators believed that the generous benefits provided under Kentucky state law created an unfavorable business climate in the state. The reform measures adopted in the special session included a substantial reduction in benefits, including those to coal miners who developed black lung disease. Patton's support of this measure alienated labor leaders, especially in eastern Kentucky's coal mining communities – which had previously been among <b>his</b> <b>strongest</b> supporters. As the law began to take effect, Patton himself agreed that it had gone too far, and his Secretary of Labor worked with representatives from organized labor to draft changes in the law. Those changes were eventually made in the 2002 legislative session.|$|E
5|$|In The King of Fighters XIII, Iori's {{gameplay}} mechanics were {{modified to}} {{be a close}} range fighter. Despite losing his flaming techniques, he was given brutal moves using his nails to emphasize his character's ferociousness. <b>His</b> <b>strongest</b> technique in the game, , is a new move that focuses on violent combos {{and serves as a}} reference to the character's ending from The King of Fighters '96 in which he brutally murders his teammates. Iori's 10th color scheme in the game matches his classic outfit's scheme, and during development of the game, details were added to increase the similarities. The ending of the character {{at the end of the}} game was also pointed by developers as something to look forward to. His version, featuring his classic techniques, was designed with the intention of not surpassing the current Iori so that players would choose the fighting style they prefer in the game. This was further emphasized in the console version of The King of Fighters XIII where Iori had his moveset adjusted for better balancing by not using flaming techniques.|$|E

5|$|In a later arc, Hitsugaya leads a {{group of}} Soul Reapers {{assigned}} to defend Karakura Town against the Arrancar that Aizen has enlisted to his cause. He defeats Shawlong Qufang, and Luppi Antenor, and upon learning that Orihime Inoue has followed the Arrancars back to their home world, Hitsugaya returns to Soul Society {{to help in the}} preparation for the war against Aizen. At Karakura Town, he engages the Espada Tier Halibel before she is mortally wounded by Aizen. From there, Hitsugaya engages Aizen, and is tricked into stabs Momo in the chest with Aizen taking advantage of the youth's rage of being tricked to cut his left limbs off. After Aizen's defeat and healed, Hitsugaya resolves to train so that he can more freely use <b>his</b> <b>strongest</b> move as a Soul Reaper, bankai, to protect Hinamori.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in Tokyo, Kenshin {{establishes}} lifelong relationships with many people, including ex-enemies, {{such as the}} former Shinsengumi member Saitō Hajime. Saitō's arrival is a test ex-Ishin Shishi Ōkubo Toshimichi made in order see Kenshin's power {{to see if he}} can defeat Shishio Makoto. Shishio is the brutal, once-successor to Kenshin's position as Chōshū's hitokiri, masterminds a movement seeking to overthrow the Meiji Government, Kenshin leaves Tokyo to stop him. To defeat such a foe, Kenshin is forced to resume his training and mend his relationship with his teacher Hiko Seijūrō, who taught and took care of him as a child. He learns the , which deals nine simultaneous strikes to the fundamental targets of swordsmanship. The Kuzu-ryūsen, however, is a by-product used for the initiation in learning <b>his</b> <b>strongest</b> technique: , a battōjutsu that surpasses the speed of the Kuzu-ryūsen. Even if the technique is defeated, it can generate a vacuum in its wake and sucking the opponent in; as this happens, the body is spun around for a second stronger strike. Throughout the training, Kenshin increasingly wants to survive to any combat so that Kaoru will not be shocked by his death. After finishing his training, Kenshin's friends reunite with him and help him defeat Shishio and his army.|$|E
