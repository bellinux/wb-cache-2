5|$|Peter wakes in the hospital, {{learning}} from Olivia {{that they saw}} a man safely cross the bridge and taken by Newton. When Walter arrives to see Peter, Peter tells him he has realized the truth: because he, like {{the man on the}} bridge, was not affected by the same shockwave that killed the FBI agent, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> from the parallel universe. Walter is unable to deny Peter's accusations. The next day, Walter is devastated to learn that Peter has discharged himself and has disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The NCAA recognizes five All-America lists in the {{determination}} of both consensus and unanimous All-America selections: the AP, AFCA, the FWAA, TSN and the WC. In order for an honoree to earn a consensus selection, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> selected as first team {{in three of the}} five lists recognized by the NCAA, and unanimous selections must be selected as first team in all five lists. As such, for the 2012 season both Milliner and Warmack were unanimous selections and Jones and Mosley were consensus selections.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of this}} {{association}} of delinquents, Mussolini, while yellow with rancour and fear and trying to cross the Swiss frontier, has been arrested. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> handed over to a tribunal of the people so it can judge him quickly. We want this, even though we think an execution platoon is {{too much of an}} honour for this man. He would deserve to be killed like a mangy dog.|$|E

5|$|Graham visits Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) and {{describes}} his visions, to which Henry replies that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> the queen's Huntsman. The Huntsman {{was hired by}} the Evil Queen to remove Snow White's heart and bring it back to her, but when he does not do so, she removes his heart. Graham later attempts to explain to Emma that he could not feel anything with Regina because he does not have a heart. Graham and Emma then encounter the wolf from Graham's visions, and follow it to a graveyard and vault marked with a symbol Graham saw in his visions and in Henry's book. Looking for his heart, Graham fervently searches the vault, which {{turns out to be the}} tomb of Henry Mills. Regina arrives to place flowers on her father's grave and is furious to find them there.|$|E
5|$|Heroes {{will appear}} {{at various points}} and times, {{sometimes}} accompanied by a tunneller dwarf, who, like imps, are able to dig. The dungeon can be protected from being breached by having the imps fortify the walls. Heroes include giants, wizards, and samurai warriors. Most levels have a 'Lord of the Land', a heavily armoured knight, who must be defeated. In the final level, the Avatar (resembling the Avatar from Ultima VIII), the most powerful hero, appears as the Lord of the Land, and is resurrected after being defeated. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> defeated again when he reappears with a large army.|$|E
5|$|If he accepts, and {{is already}} a bishop, he {{immediately}} takes office. If {{he is not a}} bishop, however, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> first consecrated as one before he can assume office. If a priest is elected, the Cardinal Dean consecrates him bishop; if a layman is elected, then the Cardinal Dean first ordains him deacon, then priest, and only then consecrates him as bishop. Only after becoming a bishop does the pope-elect take office. These functions of the Dean are assumed, if necessary, by the sub-Dean, and if the sub-Dean is also impeded, they are assumed by the senior cardinal-bishop in attendance. In 2005 the Dean himself—Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger—was elected pope. In 2013, the Dean and sub-Dean were not in attendance (over the age limit), and these functions were assumed by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{investigation}} has found traces of this {{drug in the}} other victims, with Black believing that the killer not only has access to it through his occupation but is likely consuming it himself while committing his crimes in order to readily act on his sexual fantasies. Black follows up on this, and investigates Nesbitt's pharmacy. Nesbitt is not working at the time, but Black realizes <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> the killer. He interviews Nesbitt's wife (Barbara Howard), finding {{that they have not}} had sex in eighteen years of marriage—however, Nesbitt has recently become interested in trying again.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon is seen wearing {{clothing}} {{appropriate for}} his location: over his uniform {{he wears a}} long topcoat which is wrapped firmly around him, in which he keeps his gloveless right hand warm. He retains {{a piece of his}} dignity in the gold-trimmed black bicorne he wears on his head. The mule Napoleon rides is undernourished, tired from its ordeal in struggling through the Alps. On the left of the mule is his guide, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who must constantly push himself and the mule forward, and who leans heavily on the shaft of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward. His clothes are weather-beaten, his face ruddy from the cold. He is not allowed the luxury of riding an animal, for <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> able to navigate independently, on the ground.|$|E
5|$|To have {{qualified}} for the national team under IIHF rules, a player must have met several criteria. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> {{a citizen of the}} nation, and be under the jurisdiction of that national association. Players are allowed to change which national team they represent, providing they fulfill the IIHF criteria. If participating {{for the first time in}} an IIHF event, the player was required to have played two consecutive years in the national competition of the new country without playing in another country. If the player has already played for a national team before, he may switch countries if he is a citizen of the new country, and has played for four consecutive years in the national competition of the new country. This switch may happen only once in the player's life.|$|E

5|$|After {{tying up}} Ms. Botz, the kids find all their {{telephones}} disabled (which Ms. Botz had done earlier) {{and go to}} a nearby payphone to alert the authorities. Meanwhile, Marge tries to call home to check up on the kids but because there is no answer, she and Homer decide to cancel their motel reservation and go home. They find Ms. Botz bound and gagged in front of the TV. Homer, thinking his children have gotten the best of another babysitter and unaware of her true identity, frees her and pays her handsomely. After advising Homer to keep both eyes on Bart, Ms. Botz makes a clean getaway, just seconds before the kids arrive with the police and news media to arrest her. As Bart tries to lead the police to the house, Homer attempts to berate him for his behavior towards Ms. Botz, only to be informed by a news reporter about Ms. Botz's true identity and that he just freed her. Realizing his mistake, a humiliated Homer attempts to save face by claiming he fought Botz and she escaped, then warning her on camera never to show her face to him again. Later that night, Homer moans about his blunder on TV, but Marge cheers him up by saying that if he raised three children who can hogtie a perfect stranger, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> doing something right.|$|E
5|$|Augustine's Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, {{which partly}} {{touches on the}} problem of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself {{considered}} four years earlier, in Free Will). Quoting the New Testament, Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature. Augustine replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar to the formation of habits. This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin. Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} {{solstice}} meeting, the gods are finally convinced by Artemis {{to take action against}} the Titans. Thalia is also asked by Artemis to become an immortal Huntress, and her acceptance {{is the only thing that}} prevents the onset of the Great Prophecy. Percy is told by his father that Luke is somehow not dead, and he and Annabeth return to Camp Half-Blood worried about the future. Before he can relax, however, Percy is forced to explain Bianca's death to Nico. Nico blames Percy, and when a group of spartoi arrive to attack the son of Poseidon, Nico banishes them to the realm of Hades, and Percy realizes that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> a son of Hades. Nico runs away, and the only people Percy tells the truth are Annabeth and Grover. They promise to hide this fact from everyone else, especially the Titan's army.|$|E

5|$|Jigsaw then leads Tapp to the asylum's crematorium, {{where he}} informs Tapp {{that some people}} {{actually}} desire his tests, much to Tapp's surprise. At the crematorium is Obi Tate, an arsonist who had put advertisements in the newspaper seeking for Jigsaw to test him. Tapp saves him from a burning furnace, but Obi is still frustrated {{because he wanted to}} survive his own test. Feeling that Tapp is throwing away a gift from Jigsaw, Obi runs away. Tapp then ventures through a theater, where he finds evidence that a former Jigsaw victim being held there. He soon finds that it is Jeff Thomas, the man who was saved by Sing while he and Tapp were in Jigsaw's lair. Jeff has since become suicidal from Tapp's incessant questioning, and has been recaptured by Jigsaw. Tapp saves Thomas from a wall of spikes. Thomas is still frustrated, so he runs away, wounded. As this was the last victim in the asylum, Tapp is free to pursue Jigsaw, but encounters Pighead again. Jigsaw informs Tapp that Pighead wishes to surpass Jigsaw and sabotage Tapp's game, so <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> stopped. Tapp confronts and kills Pighead; Jigsaw rhetorically asks him if he's a murderer, {{in order to get a}} key to proceed.|$|E
5|$|Robert Silverberg connects {{this account}} with {{historical}} events of 1141, when the Kara-Khitan Khanate under Yelü Dashi defeated the Seljuk Turks near Samarkand. The Seljuks ruled over Persia {{at the time}} and were the most powerful force in the Muslim world, and the defeat at Samarkand weakened them substantially. While the Kara-Khitan at the time were Buddhists and not Christian, {{and there is no reason}} to suppose Yelü Dashi was ever called Prester John. However, several vassals of the Kara-Khitan practiced Nestorian Christianity, which may have contributed to the legend, as well as the possibility that the Europeans, who were unfamiliar with Buddhism, assumed that if the leader was not Muslim, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> Christian. The defeat encouraged the Crusaders and inspired a notion of deliverance from the East, and it is possible Otto recorded Hugh's confused report to prevent complacency in the Crusade's European backers; according to his account, no help could be expected from a powerful Eastern king.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{mounted a}} third attack {{late in the}} afternoon, around 3:00. Several times German {{soldiers}} attempted to penetrate the American lines. The Americans left their foxholes and in close combat fired on the attackers to push them back down the hill. At one point PFC Milsovech spotted a medic working on and talking to a soldier he felt certain was already dead. As mortar fire on his position got more accurate, Milsovech noticed a pistol on the supposed medic's belt, and decided <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> calling in fire on their position. He shot and killed him. Bouck contacted Regimental Headquarters once more, seeking reinforcements. At 3:50, Fort sent the unit's last update to Regimental headquarters in Hünningen. He reported they were still receiving some artillery fire but were holding their position against an estimated enemy strength of about 75, who were attempting to advance from Lanzerath towards the railroad to the northwest.|$|E
