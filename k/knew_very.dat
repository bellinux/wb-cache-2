5|$|Francis Bok {{was raised}} in a large Catholic family of cattle herders in the Dinka village of Gurion in Southern Sudan. His father, Bol Buk Dol, managed several herds of cattle, sheep and goats. When Bok was {{captured}} at the age of 7 on May 15, 1986, he could not count beyond 10 and <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> little of the outside world.|$|E
5|$|The Life is {{difficult}} to follow and extremely vague on any facts. Typically the author takes facts and traditions known to him and transfers them to the saint himself. Thus there was in the twelfth century a holy relic at Llanbadarn {{believed to have been}} Padarn's staff, Cyrwen, which could well be the origin of the place name Llangorwen. The writer obviously <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> little indeed about Padarn, except that he was seen as a contemporary of David and Teilo, who certainly lived during the sixth century.|$|E
5|$|As marine {{creatures that}} reside {{in either the}} depths or the poles, humans <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> little about whales {{over the course of}} history; many feared or revered them. The Nords and various arctic tribes revered the whale as they were {{important}} pieces of their lives. In Inuit creation myths, when 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. In an Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but during the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Siegel, an {{attorney}} from Florida, {{learned of the}} case and felt that a hearing should be held about Eve's welfare. In January 2003, he initiated legal proceedings, seeking to bring the clone's parents to court so its health could be verified. Raël and Boisselier attacked the filing as an attempt to take a child from loving parents and announced that, in protest, they would not provide DNA for testing. An arraignment occurred on January 24 and was televised live on CNN; Boisselier and Clonaid's vice president, Thomas Kaenzig, were subpoenaed in lieu of the child's parents. In courtroom testimony, the vice president of Clonaid said he <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> little about the clone, and that Boisselier controlled all the information. She did not attend the hearing, and Kaenzig provided little information, angering the judge, who threatened contempt of court charges. Boisselier attended a second hearing on January 29, telling the court that the child was in Israel. The judge then ruled that the court had no jurisdiction. In late January, the science editor announced that he suspected the cloning announcements were a hoax. Around that time, Boisselier held a press conference at which she announced that the cloned baby's parents had cut off contact with her and would never speak to the press.|$|E
5|$|The total {{population}} of the English colonies at the time has been estimated at 250,000, with Virginia and New England dominating. The population centers of these colonies were concentrated along the coast, with small settlements inland, sometimes reaching {{as far as the}} Appalachian Mountains. Most European colonists <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> little of the interior of the continent, {{to the west of the}} Appalachians and south of the Great Lakes. This area was dominated by Indian tribes, although French and English traders had penetrated the area. Spanish missionaries in La Florida had established a network of missions to convert the indigenous inhabitants to Roman Catholicism. The Spanish population was relatively small (about 1,500), and the Indian population to whom they ministered has been estimated to number 20,000. French explorers had located the mouth of the Mississippi River, near which they established a small colonial presence in 1699 at Fort Maurepas (near present-day Biloxi, Mississippi). From there they began to establish trade routes into the interior, establishing friendly relations with the Choctaw, a large tribe whose enemies included the British-allied Chickasaw. All of these populations had suffered to some degree from the introduction of Eurasian infectious diseases such as smallpox by early explorers and traders.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, {{in a civil}} ceremony, Horowitz married Toscanini's {{daughter}} Wanda. Although Horowitz was Jewish and Wanda Catholic, {{this was}} not an issue, as neither was observant. As Wanda knew no Russian and Horowitz <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> little Italian, their primary language became French. They had one child, Sonia Toscanini Horowitz (1934–1975). It has never been determined whether her death in Geneva, from a drug overdose, was accidental or a suicide.|$|E
25|$|For today's botanists, Ellis Rowan’s {{painting}} {{has limited}} scientific research value {{because they are}} lacking the critical details that {{is necessary for the}} botanical illustrations.

Although Ellis confessed that she <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> little about plants, she maintained her passion and love to discovering the botanical world, dried many specimens as her collections.|$|E

25|$|Vainio {{succeeded in}} his {{preparation}} for his home championships excellently. The 10,000 metres final {{was held on}} the third day of the Championships. Despite the slow race which culminated in the last lap, Vainio finished fourth with the time 28:01.37, missing the gold medal by only 0.33 seconds and bronze by 0.11 seconds. The home audience was very impressed with his achievement, since they <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> well that he was not at his best in the slow races. The gold medal was won again by Alberto Cova.|$|E
25|$|Louis spent 12 years {{growing up}} in rural Alabama, where little is known of his childhood. He {{suffered}} from a speech impediment and spoke very little until {{about the age of}} six. Munroe Barrow was committed to a mental institution in 1916 and, as a result, Joe <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> little of his biological father. Around 1920, Louis's mother married Pat Brooks, a local construction contractor, having received word that Munroe Barrow had died while institutionalized (in reality, Munroe Barrow lived until 1938, unaware of his son's fame).|$|E
25|$|Rowell {{was born}} in Portland, Maine, on May 10, 1959.

Rowell <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> little about her father. Dorothy, who suffered from schizophrenia, took a taxi to a hospital {{to give birth to}} Rowell, leaving a son and two small daughters unsupervised. When she was 16 days old, Rowell, along with her two sisters, Sheree and Lori, was surrendered to child services.|$|E

25|$|He was {{admitted}} to the Protestant European School, like his brothers and sisters, in January 1902. He continued his studies at this school which was run by the Baptist Mission up to 1909 and then shifted to the Ravenshaw Collegiate School. Here, we was ridiculed by his fellow students because he <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> little Bengali. The day Subhas {{was admitted}} to this school, Beni Madhab Das, the headmaster, understood how brilliant and scintillating his genius was. After securing the second position in the matriculation examination in 1913, he got admitted to the Presidency College where he studied briefly.|$|E
25|$|His last {{project on}} the ground, Government of Ukraine {{building}} in Kiev, was approved for construction in 1934. This 10-story building, the earliest example of true Stalin's Empire Style, was hailed as the way to build and spawned numerous imitations. A peculiar feature is the quilt-like ornament on the columns. Fomin <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> well that a 25-meter bare column will look unnatural; the quilt warms up an otherwise dull shape. Column capitals also differ from their Corynthian prototypes: at this height, he reasoned, fine Greek details would be lost, so he simplified and enlarged leaves of his ornament.|$|E
25|$|The {{ideas of}} 19th-century German {{philosophers}} Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietzsche {{have often been}} compared, and many authors have discussed apparent similarities in their writings, sometimes raising the question of influence. In Germany, {{during the early years}} of Nietzsche's emergence as a well-known figure, the only thinker discussed in connection with his ideas more often than Stirner was Schopenhauer. It is certain that Nietzsche read about Stirner's book The Ego and Its Own (Der Einzige und sein Eigentum, 1845), which was mentioned in Lange's History of Materialism (1866) and Eduard von Hartmann's Philosophy of the Unconscious (1869), both of which young Nietzsche <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> well.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, Silvio Berlusconi, {{previously}} {{very close}} to Bettino Craxi and even having appeared in commercials for the Italian Socialist Party, was studying the possibility of making a political party of his own to avoid {{what seemed to be}} the unavoidable victory of the left wing at the next elections. Only three months before the election, he presented, with a televised announcement, his new party, Forza Italia. Supporters believe he wanted to avert a Communist victory; opponents that he was defending the ancien regime by rebranding it. Whatever his motives, he employed his power in communication (he owned, and still owns, all of the three main private TV stations in Italy) and advanced communication techniques he and his allies <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> well, as his fortune was largely based on advertising.|$|E
25|$|Ethel's {{original}} character outline {{states that}} {{she was born in}} 1920. However, during the series this was altered to 1916 and for many years her birthday fell on 19 February. When Ethel came back to Walford to die in 2000, she revealed to Dot that she had lied about her age for many years. She was actually 86, not 85 (the character was aged two years, in a dramatic technique known as SORAS making her birthday fall in 1914). Ethel died on what she claimed was the night of her 86th birthday in September 2000, and although Dot <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> well her birthday was in February, she organised a party at Ethel's request to give her one last 'birthday' before she died. 19 February is also the day that EastEnders was first broadcast.|$|E
