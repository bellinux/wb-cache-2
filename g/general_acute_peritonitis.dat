40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> is {{the most}} {{frequent}} complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), and nitric oxide (NO) is thought {{to play a role}} in the structural and permeability changes observed in this condition. We have used a combination of expression, enzymatic and pharmacological studies to substantiate the potential role(s) played by NO during peritonitis. METHODS: The peritoneal equilibration test was performed in control rats and rats with <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> (originating from skin flora), using standard dialysate supplemented or not with the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(G) -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). In parallel, peritoneal NOS enzymatic activities were measured and expression studies for NOS isoforms and S-nitrosocysteine reactivity performed in the peritoneum. RESULTS: In comparison with controls, rats with <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> were characterized by inflammatory changes, increased S-nitrosocysteine immunoreactivity, and increased NOS activities in the peritoneum, due to the up-regulation of endothelial and inducible NOS. In parallel, rats with <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> showed increased permeability for small solutes; decreased sodium sieving; loss of ultrafiltration (UF); and increased protein loss in the dialysate. Addition of L-NAME to the dialysate did not induce permeability changes in control rats, but significantly improved UF and reversed permeability modifications in rats with peritonitis. The effect of L-NAME was reflected by a mild but consistent increase in blood pressure during PD exchange. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that local generation of NO, secondary to up-regulation of NOS isoforms, plays an important role in the regulation of peritoneal permeability during <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> in rats.

40|$|The loss of {{ultrafiltration}} (UF) {{that accompanies}} <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> {{is a common}} problem in peritoneal dialysis (PD). It {{has been suggested that}} changes in nitric oxide (NO) -mediated vascular tone and permeability might be involved in the loss of UF, whereas channel-mediated water permeability should not be affected. This study used a model of <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> in rats to characterize changes in PD parameters, in correlation with: (1) expression studies of water channel aquaporin- 1 and NO synthase (NOS) isoforms and (2) enzymatic assays for NOS in the peritoneum. Compared with controls, rats with peritonitis had a higher removal of plasma urea, a faster glucose absorption, and a loss of UF. Additional changes, including high protein loss, elevated leukocyte counts in dialysate, positive bacterial cultures, edema, and mononuclear infiltrates, were similar to those observed in PD patients with <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis.</b> <b>Acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> in rats induced a major increase in total NOS activity, which was inversely correlated with free-water permeability. The increased NOS activity was mediated by both inducible (Ca 2 +-independent) and endothelial (Ca 2 +-dependent) NOS isoforms and was reflected by increased peritoneal staining for nitrotyrosine. In contrast, aquaporin- 1 expression was unchanged in rats with peritonitis. These findings cast light on the pathophysiology of permeability changes and loss of UF that characterize <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis.</b> In particular, these data suggest that a local production of NO, mediated by different NOS isoforms, might {{play a key role in}} these changes...|$|R

Previous studies have suggested a major role for nitric oxide (NO) in the permeability changes and loss of ultrafiltration induced by <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis.</b> In this study, we further investigated the potential role of NO in a mouse model of peritonitis induced by Escherichia coli Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A 2 -hour peritoneal equilibration test was performed in control and LPS-treated mice using 7 % glucose dialysate supplemented or not with the NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). The levels of NO metabolites in the dialysate were maximal 18 hours after LPS injection. At that time, <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> induced by LPS was reflected by an increased recruitment of leukocytes, an increased intraperitoneal release of interleukin- 6, {{a significant increase in}} the peritoneal permeability for small solutes, a loss of sodium sieving, and a loss of ultrafiltration in comparison with controls. Addition of L-NAME in LPS-treated mice significantly reversed permeability modifications and prevented the release of NO metabolites into the dialysate.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> is {{the most}} {{frequent}} complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Increased nitric oxide (NO) release by NO synthase (NOS) isoforms has been implicated in <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis,</b> but {{the role played by}} the NOS isoforms expressed in the peritoneum is unknown. METHODS: We investigated the structural and functional consequences of <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> induced by LPS in wild-type (WT) mice versus knockout mice (KO) for the endothelial NOS (eNOS), the inducible NOS (iNOS) or the neuronal NOS (nNOS). RESULTS: The level of NO metabolites (NOx) in the dialysate was maximal 18 h after LPS injection. LPS induced {{a significant increase in the}} transport of small solutes and decreased ultrafiltration in WT mice. These changes, which occurred without vascular proliferation, were paralleled by the upregulation of nNOS and eNOS, and the induction of iNOS. The transport modifications induced by LPS were significantly reversed in eNOS KO mice, but not modified in mice lacking iNOS or nNOS. In contrast, the increase of dialysate NOx was abolished in iNOS KO mice and significantly reduced in eNOS KO mice, but left unchanged in mice lacking nNOS. Mice lacking iNOS also showed more severe inflammatory changes, and a trend towards increased mortality following LPS. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate specific roles for NOS isoforms in the peritoneal membrane and suggest that selective eNOS inhibition may improve peritoneal transport during <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis...</b>|$|R

Exposure of C 57 BL/ 6 mice to standard dialysate yielded a transport of urea and glucose, a sodium sieving, and a net ultrafiltration that were remarkably similar to the values obtained in rats. In comparison with controls, mice with catheter-induced peritonitis were characterized by structural changes in the PM (mononuclear cells infiltrate, vascular proliferation), upregulation of endothelial and inducible NOS, increased permeability for urea and glucose, decreased ultrafiltration, and increased protein loss in the dialysate.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ultrafiltration failure (UFF) in {{continuous}} ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is a transient phenomenon during <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> and a permanent complication in long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). The high solute transport rates during <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> are probably {{caused by an}} increased number of perfused peritoneal capillaries. Long-term PD is {{associated with an increased}} number of peritoneal microvessels, leading to an enlargement of the anatomic vascular surface area. This leads to high mass transfer area coefficients (MTAC) and to UFF. Impaired conductance to glucose, leading to a reduction in free-water transport, may be a contributing factor to UFF in long-term PD. We hypothesized that UFF during <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> is, in the absence of permanent structural changes, only caused by an increased vascular surface area, while in long-term patients it is often the result of an increased surface area in combination with an impaired conductance to glucose. Therefore, the peritoneal transport parameters of patients with <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> were compared to those in long-term PD patients. METHODS: A standard peritoneal permeability analysis (SPA) was done in 10 PD patients during the first 48 hours after the diagnosis of peritonitis. The results were compared to those obtained in 10 long-term PD patients matched for the MTAC creatinine. In addition, the results of 8 peritonitis patients were compared with SPA results of 8 recently started PD patients, matched for MTAC creatinine. RESULTS: Peritonitis patients had a deeper maximal dip in D/P sodium, corrected for diffusion, than long-term patients (0. 058 vs. 0. 039, P < 0. 05). Most parameters of peritoneal fluid transport were not different, except that t 50 (i. e., the time to reach 50 % of the maximum transcapillary ultrafiltration) was reached earlier during the dwell in peritonitis than in long-term PD- 128 versus 175 minutes, P < 0. 05.

On the other hand, in the surgical domain, especially {{in case of}} <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis,</b> {{known as one of}} the prineipal surgical disease, we have very little or no literature on this subject at home and abroad. So the author performed the following experiments witn regard to the hourly change of vitamin C content in the suprarenal gland of guinea-pigs, suffering from <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis</b> through artificial infection of bac. coli. For the quantitative determination of vitamin C, strict care was taken to avoid harmful factors, which make the results uncertain, eg. only male guinea-pigs (400 - 500) were used, and the "methylenblue method" after Martini and Bonsignore was adopted, which Ammon and Hinsberg had recommended. As a control, he took preliminary experiments on the effect of starvation to the vitamin C content and confirmed that it diminished as in the case of scurvy. Then in the case of <b>acute</b> <b>peritonitis,</b> this decrease was much more pronounced than that of both former cases. At the same time, he measured variations of the weight of this organ and confirmed that vitamin C was relatively richer in the smaller organ of normal animal and that the vitamin C content and the weight of the organ were in inversed proportion in some cases of peritonitis. Also he observed that the organ of guinea-pigs was generally larger in the left side than in the right. From the fact that the vitamin C content in the suprarenal gland of guinea-pigs, though it diminished as the time passes through starvation, showed a remarkable decrease in the case of peritonitis, it may be concluded that there exists an intimate relation between the inflammation and vitamin C, so far as other conditions are constant...|$|R
