At 18:30, the {{aircraft}} was out of beer, so Huseby made an agreement that he would throw the <b>gun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the window in exchange for more beer. This was delivered by a civilian police officer. The aircraft was then immediately stormed by special forces and Huseby arrested. No-one was injured in the hijacking.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1957, Stompanato visited Turner in England, where she was filming Another Time, Another Place (1958), co-starring Sean Connery. In her autobiography, Turner said that she {{arranged}} for Stompanato's visit because she was lonely and having a difficult time filming. Their reunion was initially happy, but the two soon began fighting. Stompanato became suspicious when Turner would not allow him to visit the set and, during one fight, he choked her, causing her to miss three weeks of filming. Turner later wrote {{that she and her}} makeup man, Del Armstrong, called Scotland Yard in order to have Stompanato deported. Stompanato got wind of the plan and showed up on the set with a gun, threatening her and her co-star Sean Connery, whom he warned to keep away from Turner. Connery answered by grabbing the <b>gun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Stompanato's hand and twisting his wrist, causing him to run off the set sheepishly. Turner and Armstrong later returned with two Scotland Yard detectives to the rented house where she and Stompanato were staying. The detectives advised Stompanato to leave and escorted {{him out of the house}} and also to the airport, where he boarded a plane back to the United States.|$|E

At the time of writing the script, the troubles had just begun in Northern Ireland and the BBC were reluctant to broadcast the production. An appeal by the author to David Attenborough (Director of Programming for the BBC at that time) resulted in the play eventually being broadcast; Attenborough took the view that the imperatives of free speech could not be compromised in the cause of political expediency.|$|E
25|$|On 23 August 1918, McCarthy {{performed}} {{what was}} later {{described in the}} official history as being the most effective piece of individual fighting {{in the history of}} the AIF, next to Albert Jacka's Military Cross-winning feat at Pozières. Near Madam Wood, east of Vermandovillers, France, the battalion was heavily opposed by well-posted German machine-guns. McCarthy, realizing the situation, dashed across the open ground with two men to the nearest post, where, having out-distanced his companions, he put the <b>gun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action, then continued fighting his way down the trench. Later, having been joined by one of his men, together they bombed their way along the trench until contact was established with an adjoining unit.|$|E

His <b>gun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> reach, the hunter suddenly finds himself cornered by the grizzly, who rears and roars {{at the sight of the}} man. Faced with certain death, the hunter cowers in fear. The grizzly, seemingly affected by the hunter's distress, turns and leaves. The young hunter, impressed by the bear's act of mercy, attempts to scare him off more quickly by shooting his gun into the air. When the hunter's companion joins him, having heard the gunshots, the younger man tells him that the bear is dead. However, spying the bear ascending a scree, the older man raises his rifle to shoot, only to be stopped by the other man. The three hunters return to their camp empty-handed, where they free the young cub and then ride off into the wilderness.|$|E

500|$|German machine gunners had {{occupied}} a commanding vantage overlooking the sunken road, {{and began to}} rain down heavy fire around Towner's position. One of the bullets struck his helmet, inflicting a gaping wound to his scalp. Refusing to be evacuated for medical treatment, Towner continued firing his gun as the German pressure increased and the situation grew critical. Eventually the Australian infantry were forced to retire a short distance, but with all its crew having become casualties, one gun was left behind. Alone, Towner dashed out over no man's land and retrieved the weapon. With this gun he [...] "continued to engage the enemy whenever they appeared", putting a German machine <b>gun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action with his accurate fire.|$|E

[...] In {{the course of}} this action, Baskeyfield's crew was killed or wounded and Baskeyfield himself was badly injured. [...] However he refused to be evacuated and in a later German attack he worked his gun alone, loading, laying and firing it himself. [...] He fired round after round until enemy fire put his <b>gun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action, and crawled to the second gun, whose crew had similarly been disabled. From here he engaged another self-propelled gun, dispatching it with two rounds, but was killed shortly afterwards by fire from another German tank.|$|E

Jeff Lapointe of MTV News viewed that it [...] "depicts the darker side of human nature as Usher drives up to his girlfriend/ex-girlfriends house to discover another vehicle, another man, another side of his love. In the realization of fury and anger, images distort Usher's reality with thoughts of taking his gun and shooting the intruder. Thoughts of running away with the girl. Thoughts of driving off to never be seen." ...|$|E

500|$|In Joe Macbeth (1955), {{the first}} film to {{transpose}} Macbeth into a gang and Mafia-like setting, Fleance {{is replaced by a}} character named Lenny. Lenny's father, Banky, is killed, but Lenny escapes, and gathers a group of angry mobsters to overthrow Macbeth, who has, through a series of murders, made himself the kingpin gangster in the area. Lenny is successful in killing Macbeth in the end, but only after Macbeth has murdered most of his family. In another gangster adaptation, Men of Respect (1991), Fleance is replaced by a character named Phil, who similarly helps overthrow Mike (Macbeth) after his father, Bankie (Banquo), is murdered. Phil is inducted into the gang {{at the end of the}} film, when Mal (Malcolm) has taken over, suggesting that the violent gang culture will continue through generations. This sentiment echoes into the final scenes of Penny Woolcock's Macbeth on the Estate. Macduff shoots Macbeth and takes a ring (representing his high status) off Macbeth's finger. Entering a bar, he flips it to Malcolm, saying, [...] "Hail, king." [...] Malcolm puts it on with some show and elbows his way to the front of the bar. One of the characters he elbows is Fleance (a skinhead), who makes a mock <b>gun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his fingers and [...] "shoots" [...] at the back of the darker-skinned Malcolm's skull. Again this makes it clear that the violence will not end with the new generation.|$|E
500|$|The alien creatures were {{featured}} in 39 cuts {{of the film}} through five scenes. The first scene was {{in the beginning of}} the film where the aliens emerge from their spacecraft into the desert to shoot Neill's character. Two matte set-ups were used for effects, including one used to create the illusion of depth with Neill's character in the foreground and the aliens in the background. The sequence where Neill's character shoots the <b>gun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the hand of one of the aliens was done through wire-supported animation. In the second and third sequences, the two aliens are on board their spaceship, which is a miniature set designed by Dave Carson. The aliens speak with their commander through a monitor in the second sequence, and animations of the commander alien were shot separately and implemented into the scene using a rear projection effect. Both sequences also used rear projection to show footage of Billy and his destruction on Earth. The fourth sequence shows the aliens on Earth, looking at a burnt-out car destroyed by Billy. Footage of the car was rear projected behind the alien models; however, the projected footage was shot at night and the scene took place between two daytime live-action scenes, thus creating a continuity error in the film. The final scene is the shortest, and features a confrontation between the aliens and Billy. Matting was again used for the sequence where Billy is shot with a gun by one of the aliens from the top of a building. [...] The aliens then fly off in their spaceship at the end of the scene through a cutout animation effect.|$|E
2500|$|Stangensteuerung gears for [...] "stationary" [...] (i.e. in-line) engines, {{worked from}} a small cam {{immediately}} behind the propeller itself (see illustration). This produced a basic dilemma: a short, fairly robust push rod meant that the machine gun had to be mounted well forward, putting the breech of the <b>gun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the pilot's reach for the clearing of jams. If the gun was mounted in the ideal position, within easy reach of the pilot, a much longer push rod was required, which tended to bend and break.|$|E
