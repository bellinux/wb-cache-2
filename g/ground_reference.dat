2500|$|On 15 April, {{during the}} Battle of Arras, VI Corps {{forwarded}} to Allenby {{a report that}} a conference of the commanders of the 17th Division, 29th Division and 50th Division and the corps Brigadier-General General Staff (BGGS), had resolved that the recent piecemeal attacks should stop and that larger coordinated actions should be conducted after a pause to reorganise, which Allenby accepted. On 17 April, the 56th Division commander objected to an operation planned for 20 April, due to the exhaustion of his troops. The division was withdrawn instead, when the VI and VII corps commanders and General Horne, the First Army commander also pressed for a delay. VI Corps delegated the barrage arrangements for the attack on 23 April, to the divisions involved, which included variations in {{the speed of the}} barrage, to be determined by the state of the <b>ground.</b> <b>Reference</b> was made in Third Army Artillery Instructions No.12 (18 April) to [...] Instructions on the Use of Lethal and Lachrymatory Shell and an Army memo, regarding low flying German aeroplanes, called attention to [...] Notes on Firing at Aircraft with Machine Guns and Other Small Arms.

In contrast, the billows cover only a certain portion of the sky, so a correction measured at any one ground station is only really useful for receivers located nearby. To make the corrections accurate over a large area, one would need to deploy many <b>ground</b> <b>reference</b> stations and broadcast {{a considerable amount of}} data for finely divided locations.

40|$|A look-point {{aircraft}} coordinate estimator (LACE) {{consisting of}} a windshield runway symbol projector, pilot input controls, microprocessor, and eye-alignment device is described. The estimator is used by a pilot to determine his aircraft's position relative to a runway or other visible terrain or target. The pilot initially superimposes and then corrects the superposition of the runway symbol over the runway during approach during periods when the runway is visible. Using the pilot's inputs the microprocessor calculates {{the position of the}} aircraft in terms of runway coordinates, then generates an approach trajectory and issues instructions to an autopilot. The microprocessor contains a model of the aircraft's dynamics and calculates a theoretical aircraft trajectory. The theoretical position of the aircraft is then used to drive the runway symbol, with the pilot's input being additive. The system thus acts as an aid in making low visibility approaches and landings when only an occasional glimpse of the runway is possible and no <b>ground</b> <b>referenced</b> landing systems are available. The system can also be used as an independent landing monitor for <b>ground</b> <b>referenced</b> landing systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} approach to language understanding that treats all ambiguity resolution as a problem of <b>reference</b> resolution: <b>grounding</b> <b>references</b> to episodic memory. This model of language understanding is evaluated with an implementation of DMAP (Direct Memory Access Parsing) called REDMAP (Reference resolution in Episodic memory for DMAP). DMAP is a language understanding model that recognizes its input by mapping phrasal patterns to existing knowledge structures, updating memory with new information only as needed. REDMAP works with a large logic based memory (evaluated with ResearchCyc 1. 28 million assertions). It uses lexically driven rules to form candidate sets of assertions, and queries memory to <b>ground</b> <b>references</b> in those assertions to existing instances. Assertions from subsequent sentences are merged with running interpretations by identifying how new references are mapped to existing references. Mappings are evaluated by propagating remindings to existing instances to the new references. These instances are substituted into the new assertions, and memory is queried for their existence. If found these assertions support the reference mapping. Additionally, these queries will simultaneously ground any new unmapped references...|$|R

40|$|Three {{types of}} head-up display format are investigated.

Formats are {{generated}} by computer and presented by reflecting collimation against a simulated forward view in flight. Pilots, holding commercial licenses, fly approaches in the instrument flight mode {{and in a}} combined instrument and visual flight mode. The approaches are in wind shear with varied conditions of visibility, offset, and turbulence. The displays are equivalent in pure tracking {{but there is a}} slight advantage for the unreferenced director in poor conditions. Flight path displays are better for tracking in the combined flight mode, possibly because of poor director control laws and the division of attention between superimposed fields. Workloads is better for the type 2 displays. The flight path and referenced director displays are criticized for effects of symbol motion and field limiting. In the subjective judgment of pilots familiar with the director displays, they are rated clearly better than path displays, with a preference for the unreferenced director. There is a fair division of attention between superimposed fields...|$|R
40|$|The {{instrumentation}} {{and practical}} circuitry {{required for the}} detection of negative ions exiting the mass analysis section of a mass spectrometer is examined. The potentials needed to bias the electron multiplier when detecting negative ions from a low ion-energy mass spectrometer, e. g., a quadrupole, are contrasted with the biasing requirements of a mass spectrometer having high ion-energies, e. g., a magnetic sector. Methods of decoupling the biasing high voltage on the signal lead of the multiplier in pulse counting measurements are discussed in detail so that normal, <b>ground</b> <b>referenced</b> input, pulse preamplifiers may be used. Easily understood, practical rules for determining the values of circuit components are given together with a simplified theory of transferring pulse signals from multiplier collector to pulse preamplifier. The changes in circuitry needed when attempting to detect ions by current measurement methods from an electron multiplier area detailed. The effects of leakage currents into athe input of the current preamplifier and their avoidance bay using triaxial shielding on vacuum feed-throughs are explained.
