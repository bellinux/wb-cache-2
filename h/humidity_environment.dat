2500|$|As a group, springtails {{are highly}} {{sensitive}} to desiccation, {{because of their}} tegumentary respiration. although some species with thin, permeable cuticles {{have been shown to}} resist severe drought by regulating the osmotic pressure of their body fluid. The gregarious behaviour of Collembola, mostly driven by the attractive power of pheromones excreted by adults, gives more chance to every juvenile or adult individual to find suitable, better protected places, where desiccation could be avoided and reproduction and survival rates (thereby fitness) could be kept at an optimum. Sensitivity to drought varies from species to species and increases during ecdysis. Given that springtails are moulting repeatedly during their entire life (an ancestral character in Hexapoda) they spend much time in concealed micro-sites where they can find protection against desiccation and predation during ecdysis, an advantage reinforced by synchronized moulting. The high <b>humidity</b> <b>environment</b> of many caves also favours springtails and there are numerous cave adapted species, including one, Plutomurus ortobalaganensis living [...] down the Krubera Cave.|$|E

A humidity control system was installed on a tensile-mode fatigue tester equipped with an electrostatic force grip. A specimen and a griping device were inserted into a small chamber and the humidity was controlled by air flow from a temperature and humidity chamber. The humidity stability was within ± 2 %RH for humidities in the range 25 – 90 %RH for eight hours of testing. Fatigue tests were performed on single-crystal silicon (SCS) specimens in constant <b>humidity</b> <b>environments</b> and laboratory air for up to 106 cycles. The gauge length, width, and thickness of the SCS specimens were 100 or 500 [*]μm, 13. 0 [*]μm, and 3. 3 [*]μm, respectively. The average tensile strength was 3. 68 GPa in laboratory air; this value decreased in high <b>humidity</b> <b>environments.</b> Fatigue failure was observed during cyclic loading at stresses lower than the average strength. A reduction in the fatigue strength was observed at high relative humidities. Different fracture origins and fracture behaviors were observed in tensile tests and fatigue tests, which indicates that the water vapor in air affects the fatigue properties of SCS specimens...|$|R

50|$|Summers peak in May and June. Rain starts around {{third week}} of June. Renukoot is 1,400 feet above sea level, with nearby hills {{exceeding}} 2000 feet. This makes the weather in Renukoot much less humid than in the nearby plain cities such as Varanasi and Mirzapur. Renukoot is also surrounded by thick well-preserved forests that keeps the temperatures down, especially after the rain. Temperature tends to fall in the evening after sunset in the summer, making it much more pleasant in May and June as compared to cities such as a Varanasi and Lucknow. Once the rains start in July, the weather becomes much milder than in the plains of U.P, with low humidity, and pleasant temperatures in the evening falling into the low 20s. Daytime summer is very bearable due to guaranteed power-supply from Hindalco to the Hindalco colony, clean roads, lots of shades and trees, and desert coolers that work well in the low <b>humidity</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
50|$|Canopy {{temperature}} {{depression is}} highly suitable for selecting physiologically superior lines in warm, low relative <b>humidity</b> <b>environments</b> where high evaporative demand leads to leaf cooling {{of up to}} 10 °C below ambient temperatures. This permits differences among genotypes to be detected relatively easily using infrared thermometry. However, such differences cannot be detected in high relative <b>humidity</b> <b>environments</b> because the effect of evaporative cooling of leaves is negligible. Nonetheless, leaves maintain their stomata open to permit the uptake of CO2, and differences {{in the rate of}} CO2 fixation may lead to differences in leaf conductance that can be measured using a porometer. Porometry can be used to screen individual plants. The heritability of stomatal conductance is reasonably high, with reported values typically in the range of 0.5 to 0.8. Plants can be assessed for leaf conductance using a viscous flow porometer that is available on the market (Thermoline and CSIRO, Australia). This instrument can give a relative measure of stomatal conductance in a few seconds, making it possible to identify physiologically superior genotypes from within bulks.|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} alternative binders are playing an increasing role in carbon dioxide (CO 2) abatement in green construction and the repair of traditionally built structures. Natural Hydraulic Lime (NHL) has better environmental credentials than Portland Cement (PC) {{due in part}} to its lower calcination temperature and its ability to absorb CO 2 during carbonation. However, NHL is more sensitive to climatic conditions during the setting and hardening processes and this is especially pronounced in high humidity climates. This research investigated the influence of various types of calcitic fillers (oyster shells, limestone, marble and precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC)) modifications to NHL mortars subjected to high temperature and <b>humidity</b> <b>environments</b> and evaluated the subsequent effect on early development of various chemical and physical properties. Primary mortar parameters such as moisture loss, pH, carbonation depth, flexural strength, compressive strength, sorptivity and microscopy analysis (SEM images) were studied. The results showed that the setting and hardening of those mortars with precipitated calcium carbonate worked most effectively in high <b>humidity</b> <b>environments.</b> The purity and crystallinity of the mineral ‘seeding’ materials was attributed to the positive benefits in the physical characteristics. Additionally, curing at higher temperatures greatly accelerated the hydration reaction of the mortar. It is evident from the findings that modified mortars can increase the performance especially in terms of carbonation rate, flexural strength, compressive strength and sorptivity. Whilst the precipitated calcium carbonate showed positive benefits in early stage setting reactions it did not significantly influence the long term physical characteristics of the mortars. This situation is meaningful for our understanding of modified lime mortars and the seeding materials. This research can be used to influence the specification and product design of NHL materials in high temperature and high <b>humidity</b> <b>environments</b> and this is especially important for its early stage use that has been traditionally associated with reduced set characteristics...|$|R
5000|$|In 1880, Camille Alphonse Faure {{patented}} {{a method}} of coating a lead grid (which serves as the current conductor) with a paste of lead oxides, sulfuric acid and water, followed by curing phase in which the plates were exposed to gentle heat in a high <b>humidity</b> <b>environment.</b> The curing process caused the paste to change to a mixture of lead sulfates which adhered to the lead plate. Then, during the battery's initial charge (called [...] "formation") the cured paste on the plates was converted into electrochemically active material (the [...] "active mass"). Faure's process significantly reduced the time and cost to manufacture lead-acid batteries, and gave {{a substantial increase in}} capacity compared with Planté's battery. Faure's method is still in use today, with only incremental improvements to paste composition, curing (which is still done with steam, but is now a very tightly controlled process), and structure and composition of the grid to which the paste is applied.|$|E
50|$|Prawn {{crackers}} {{are made}} by mixing prawns, tapioca flour and water. The mixture is rolled out, steamed, sliced and sun-dried. In the traditional way, to achieve maximum crispiness, raw crackers are usually sun-dried first before frying, to eliminate the moisture. Once dry, they are deep-fried in oil (which must be at high heat before cooking). In {{only a few seconds}} they expand from thumb-sized semi-transparent chips to white fluffy crackers, much like popcorn, as water bound to the starch expands as it turns into steam. If left in the open air {{for more than a few}} hours (depending on humidity), they start to soften and become chewy and are therefore ideally consumed within a few hours of being fried. Storing the crackers in a low <b>humidity</b> <b>environment</b> or an airtight container will preserve the crispness. Packets of unfried prawn crackers may be purchased in oriental stores, or stores that specialise in Asian cuisine. In the Netherlands, Belgium, Suriname, France, Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom they are also widely available in general supermarkets.|$|E

Some contemporary arts, like Sand art, are also close related to capability of water to bridge particles. In Atomic force microscopy, when one works in higher <b>humidity</b> <b>environment,</b> his studies might {{be affected by the}} appearance of nanosized capillary bridges. These bridges appear when the working tip approaches the studied sample. Capillary bridges also play important role in soldering process.Capillary bridges also widely spread in living nature. Bugs, flies, grasshoppers and tree frogs are capable to adhere to vertical rough surfaces because of their ability to inject wetting liquid into the pad-substrate contact area. This way is created long range attractive interaction due to the formation of capillary bridges. Many medical problems involving respiratory diseases, and the health of the body joints depend on tiny capillary bridges. Liquid bridges are now commonly used in growth of cell cultures because of the need to mimic work of living tissues in scientific research.|$|E

5000|$|The Industrial Revolution in Great Britain caused {{extensive}} pollution, {{and industrial}} {{cities such as}} Manchester and Birmingham were covered with black soot. R.S. Edleston {{was the first to}} identify the unusual black peppered moth in 1848 in Manchester. By the end of the century, it was recorded that the black moth, the carbonaria type, outnumbered (90% in some regions) the natural white ones, named typica. There were conflicting ideas as to the biological basis of this so-called industrial melanism. <b>Humidity,</b> <b>environment,</b> heredity, disease, temperature and protection (such as camouflage) were the factors put forward. J. W. Tutt was the first to come up with natural selection as an explanation, and stated in 1894 that the phenomenon was due to selective predation by birds. With the rise of evolutionary statistics, the theoretical background was set. For example, J.B.S. Haldane estimated in 1924 the rate of evolution by natural selection in the peppered moth in his first series of A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection. He estimated that for the peppered moth having reproductive cycle in a year, it would take 48 generations to produce the dominant (melanic or black) forms, and the melanic population could dominate the entire moth population after 13 generations. He concluded that [...] "the only probable explanation is the not very intense degree of natural selection". University of Oxford zoologist E. B. Ford supported the bird-predation hypothesis. To experimentally investigate the issue he recruited Bernard Kettlewell in 1952 under a grant from Nuffield Foundation.|$|E

40|$|The {{strength}} of a corrugated container is usually determined and reported as crush strength under progressively increasing top-to-bottom compressive load. 1 The test is performed in seconds in a controlled constant temperature and relative <b>humidity</b> <b>environment.</b> However, a dynamic strength test under controlled conditions cannot account for the reduction in load-carrying ability inherent in the extended duration and changing <b>humidity</b> <b>environment</b> of actual warehousing and storage.

Apparently, other means are needed to effectively measure and predict the long-term, load-carrying ability of corrugated board and containers in the actual service environment. 2 - 4 ASTM Method D 4577 - 66 5 has been approved for the testing of containers, but suitable standards have not been set for testing paperboard and corrugated board. In 1987, Considine and Gunderson 6 described a method for mechanical testing of paperboard during compressive creep in a cyclic <b>humidity</b> <b>environment.</b> The USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory (FPL), recently developed a device for evaluating corrugated board (the composite of linerboard faces and fluted corrugating medium) under conditions of constant load in a cyclic <b>humidity</b> <b>environment.</b> In this new device, corrugated board specimens can be loaded in either edgewise compression or flat-wise bending. Corrugated board performance in these two modes is generally accepted as the dominant factor in determining container strength in dynamic tests. ’ Because our constant load tests are necessarily of extended duration, testing multiple specimens at the same time is most efficient.
