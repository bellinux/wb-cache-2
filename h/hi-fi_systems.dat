25|$|Sales of {{pre-recorded}} music cassettes in the U.S. {{dropped from}} 442 million in 1990 to 274,000 by 2007. Another record low was registered in 2009, with 34,000 cassettes sold. Most {{of the major}} U.S. music companies had discontinued production of cassette tapes by 2003. However, , blank cassettes were still being produced and are still sold at some retail stores, while facilities for cassette duplication remain available. Cassette recorders and players are gradually becoming more scarce, but are still widely available and featured in some <b>hi-fi</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E
25|$|Notches {{on top of}} the {{cassette}} shell indicate the type of tape. Type I cassettes have only write-protect notches, Type II have an additional pair next to the write protection ones, and Type IV (metal) have a third set near the middle of the top of {{the cassette}} shell. These allow later cassette decks to detect the tape type automatically and select the proper bias and equalization. Virtually all recent <b>hi-fi</b> <b>systems</b> (with cassette decks) lack this feature; only a small niche of cassette decks (hi-fi separates) have the tape type selector. Playing Type II and IV tapes on a player without detection will produce exaggerated treble, {{but it may not be}} noticeable because such devices typically have amplifiers that lack extended high-frequency output. Recording on these units, however, results in very low sound reproduction, and sometimes distortion and noise is heard. Also, these cheaper units cannot erase high bias or metal bias tapes. Attempting to do so will result in an incomplete erasure. This is due to the fact that the bias levels for high and metal position require greater levels.|$|E
