5|$|After the Scilly naval <b>disaster</b> <b>of</b> 1707 {{where four}} ships ran aground due to navigational mistakes, the British {{government}} offered a large prize of £20,000, equivalent {{to millions of}} pounds today, for anyone who could determine longitude accurately. The reward was eventually claimed in 1761 by Yorkshire carpenter John Harrison, who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks.|$|E
5|$|In 1721, the {{economic}} <b>disaster</b> <b>of</b> the South Sea Bubble allowed Walpole {{to rise to}} the pinnacle of government. Walpole and his Whig Party were dominant in politics, as the king feared that the Tories would not support the succession laid down in the Act of Settlement. The power of the Whigs was so great that the Tories would not come to hold power for another half-century.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong {{served on}} two spaceflight {{accident}} investigations. The first was in 1970, after Apollo 13, where {{as part of}} Edgar Cortright's panel, he produced a detailed chronology of the flight. Armstrong opposed the report's recommendation to re-design the service module's oxygen tanks, {{the source of the}} explosion. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the Rogers Commission which investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger <b>disaster</b> <b>of</b> that year.

5|$|In contrast, the {{excellent}} {{performance of the}} infantry, both comitatenses and limitanei, is a recurrent feature of Ammianus' history. At the Persian siege of Amida, Ammianus' eye-witness account describes the city's defence by limitanei units as skilful and tenacious, if ultimately unsuccessful. At Strasbourg (357), the infantry showed remarkable skill, discipline and resilience throughout, saving the day at two critical moments.(see Battle of Strasbourg for a detailed account). Even at the <b>disaster</b> <b>of</b> Adrianople, the Roman infantry fought on, despite being abandoned by their cavalry and surrounded on three sides by overwhelmingly superior numbers of Goths.|$|E

The {{hurricane}} produced Jamaica's deadliest natural <b>disaster</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century, causing more than 152 deaths and $50,000,000 in damages. The hurricane {{was described as}} Tampico's worst tropical cyclone since 1936, and it caused more than 100 fatalities in the surrounding areas. Many bodies were not recovered after flooding. The hurricane produced peak gusts of 160mph (260km/h) at the airport, and its strongest sustained winds were unmeasured in mainland Mexico, suggesting {{that it may have}} been a Category4 hurricane at landfall.|$|E
5|$|It {{was opened}} as Ibrox Park in 1899, but {{suffered}} a disaster in 1902 when a wooden terrace collapsed. Vast earthen terraces {{were built in}} its place, while a main stand, which is now a listed building, was built in 1928. A British record crowd of 118,567 gathered in January 1939 for a league match with Celtic. After the Ibrox <b>disaster</b> <b>of</b> 1971, the stadium was largely rebuilt. The vast bowl-shaped terracing was removed and replaced by three rectangular, all-seated stands by 1981. After renovations were completed in 1997, the ground was renamed Ibrox Stadium.|$|E

5|$|On 15–16 January 1974, Suharto faced a {{significant}} challenge when violent riots {{broke out in}} Jakarta during visit of Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka. Students demonstrating against increasing dominance of Japanese investors was encouraged by General Sumitro, deputy commander of armed forces. Sumitro was an ambitious general who disliked the strong influence of Suharto's Aspri inner circle. It was reported to Suharto that the riots were engineered by Sumitro who wished to destabilize the regime utilizing the student unrest, resulting in Sumitro's dismissal and forced retirement. This incident is referred as Malari Incident (Malapetaka Lima Belas Januari / <b>Disaster</b> <b>of</b> 15 January). However, Suharto also disbanded Aspri to appease popular dissent.|$|E
5|$|The BR Standard Class 8 was a {{class of}} 4-6-2 Pacific steam {{locomotive}} designed by Robert Riddles for use by British Railways. Only the prototype was constructed, which was named Duke of Gloucester.

5|$|The Scilly naval <b>disaster</b> <b>of</b> 1707, {{in which}} a fleet {{commanded}} by Sir Cloudesley Shovell foundered, highlighted mismanagement at the Admiralty, for which George was nominally responsible. Pressure grew to replace Admiral Churchill with someone more dynamic. By October 1708, five powerful politicians, known as the Whig Junto—Lords Somers, Halifax, Orford, Wharton and Sunderland—were clamouring {{for the removal of}} both Prince George and Churchill. Marlborough wrote to his brother telling him to resign, but Churchill refused, protected by Prince George.|$|E

5|$|The {{death toll}} was {{increased}} {{by the lack}} of early warnings, unwise land use, as villages were built in the likely path of lahars, and the lack of preparedness in communities near the volcano. Colombia's worst natural disaster, the Armero tragedy (as it came to be known) was the second-deadliest volcanic <b>disaster</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century (surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée). It was the fourth-deadliest eruption recorded since 1500 AD. Its lahars were the deadliest in volcanic history.|$|E

5|$|Toxicology testing became {{important}} in the 20th century. In the 19th century, laws regulating drugs were more relaxed. For example, in the U.S., the government could only ban a drug after a company had been prosecuted for selling products that harmed customers. However, {{in response to the}} Elixir Sulfanilamide <b>disaster</b> <b>of</b> 1937 in which the eponymous drug killed more than 100 users, the U.S. congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed. Other countries enacted similar legislation. In the 1960s, in reaction to the Thalidomide tragedy, further laws were passed requiring safety testing on pregnant animals before a drug can be sold.|$|E

5|$|All {{but one of}} the 22 {{people to}} manage Scotland had played the game professionally. The {{exception}} is Dawson Walker, who was placed in interim charge of the team while Matt Busby was recovering from the effects of the Munich air <b>disaster.</b> <b>Of</b> the 21 Scotsmen to hold the post of manager, ten were never capped for the senior Scotland team as a player (Walker, Stein, Prentice, MacDonald, MacLeod, Ferguson, Roxburgh, Brown, Smith and Stark), although some of them did represent the Scottish Football League (Stein, Prentice, MacDonald and Ferguson). Of the 11 that played for Scotland, six earned at least 10 caps: McColl (14), Docherty (25), McLeish (77), Burley (11), Levein (16) and Strachan (50). Four also served as Scotland captains; Docherty (8), McLeish (8), Levein (1) and Strachan (5). Berti Vogts, the only foreign manager to hold the post, earned 96 caps for West Germany and was part of their 1974 World Cup winning side.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{competed in}} the UEFA Cup in the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons and {{departed}} {{in the first and}} second round to FC Winterslag and Spartak Moscow respectively. The Heysel Stadium <b>disaster</b> <b>of</b> May 1985, during the 1985 European Cup Final between Liverpool and Juventus resulted in UEFA, and later FIFA, imposing a 'worldwide' ban on English teams from participating in European club competitions, initially for an indefinite period. Under George Graham, Arsenal returned to the European Cup in the 1991–92 season, having won the league championship a season earlier. They went out in the second round to Portuguese team Benfica in November 1991. The ban arising from the Heysel disaster had prevented Arsenal from competing in the European Cup when they won the league title two years previously, as well as preventing them from competing in the UEFA Cup on two occasions.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin III finally seized Ascalon in 1153, {{which brought}} Egypt into {{the sphere of}} conflict. Jerusalem {{was able to make}} further {{advances}} into Egypt, briefly occupying Cairo in the 1160s. However, relations with the Byzantine Empire were mixed, and reinforcements from Europe were sparse after the <b>disaster</b> <b>of</b> the Second Crusade. King Amalric I of Jerusalem allied with the Byzantines and participated in a combined invasion of Egypt in 1169, but the expedition ultimately failed. In 1171, Saladin, nephew of one of Nur ad-Din's generals, was proclaimed Sultan of Egypt, uniting Egypt and Syria and completely surrounding the crusader kingdom. Meanwhile, the Byzantine alliance ended with the death of emperor Manuel I in 1180, and in 1187, Jerusalem capitulated to Saladin. His forces then spread north to capture all but the capital cities of the Crusader States, precipitating the Third Crusade.|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to assess the ability to resist <b>disasters</b> <b>of</b> urban power grid, find the vulnerabilities of system and put forward the evaluation results and improvements. Firstly, according to the actual <b>disaster</b> relief demand <b>of</b> urban power grid, the fault tree analysis method is proposed in this paper to analyze the causes of the accident and in accordance with this to establish the evaluation index system of capacity to prevent <b>disasters</b> <b>of</b> urban power grid. Secondly, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) which is based on exponential scale is used to collate and calculate the indicators in the evaluation process <b>of</b> <b>disaster</b> resistance <b>of</b> urban power grid. The research achievement is helpful to recognize the grid’s vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of accidents caused by disasters in urban power grid’s planning and construction <b>of</b> <b>disaster</b> resistance...|$|R
