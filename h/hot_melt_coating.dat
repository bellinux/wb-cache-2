Solvent evaporation technique was employed to prepare films of different combinations of polymers, plasticizer, and a modal drug sulindac to narrow down on a few polymer-plasticizer-sulindac combinations. The sulindac-polymer-plasticizer combination that was stable with good film forming properties was processed by <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> mixing, a technique close to <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion, to predict its behavior in a <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion process. <b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> mixing is not a substitute to <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion but is an aid in predicting the formation of molecularly dispersed form of a given set of drug-polymer-plasticizer combination in a <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion process.

40|$|In {{metallic}} hot {{dip coating}} processes, {{the formation of a}} thin continuous and uniform alloy layer is critical in providing the vital metallurgical bond at the substrate-coating melt interface. When the alloy layer isn't uniform, bare spots or uncoated areas are formed which greatly affect the corrosion resistance and surface appearance of the coated product. Direct and indirect dynamic measurements of mass transfer during metallic coating are difficult, if not impossible. However, the concept of interfacial resistance to mass transfer is analogous to that of interfacial resistance to heat transfer. Using this concept, measurements based on dynamic reactive wetting and thermal interfacial resistance were performed at millisecond resolution to study the effects of low carbon substrate oxidation on the formation of 55 Al-Zn- 1. 6 Si {{hot dip coating}}s.

40|$|Hot-melt {{adhesives}} {{have been}} commercially {{available for a}} long time and they are used in a wide range of applications. In recent years, packaging industry prefers to use <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive based on polyolefin because polyolefin provide ease of processing, low off-taste, low smell and heat seal ability. In this research, it is intended to develop the formulation for Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) based <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive with the same properties of polyolefin based <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive since EVA offers low cost than polyolefin. To develop new formulation of EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive (HMA), EVA copolymers with various melt index were blended together with resin, wax and antioxidant in the molten state. The performance of new formulations was compared with commercial polyolefin <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive. Three formulations of EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive have been developed. The thermal properties such as glass transition temperature and melt viscosity were studied by using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and Brookfield Viscometer. From DSC curve, the result indicated that three new formulations and commercial polyolefin has a glass transition temperature between - 20 0 C and - 25 0 C. Implying, the EVA copolymer blend with resin is compatible. The peak observed on the heating curve corresponded to the melting point, Tm. EVA-HMA 1 and EVA-HMA 3 is comparable with commercial polyoelfin based on identical broad peak. The melt viscosity of all EVA HMA formulation and commercial polyolefin HMA decrease with increasing the temperature. <b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive with lower viscosity will have more flexibility to flow out, indicating that it has better wetting properties when applied to the substrate. EVA-HMA 3 have the best performance to be made the <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive for the packaging industry because of comparable thermal properties and viscosity at desired temperature with commercial polyolefin adhesive.

40|$|A multi-unit {{floating}} {{drug delivery}} system containing pellets with lipid coating were fabricated. Coated pellets were prepared by a fluid bed <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>coating</b> technique with drug-lipid dispersion. Metoprolol tartrate {{was used as a}} water soluble model drug and hydrogenated soybean oil (HSO) was used as a lipid carrier. The drug was dispersed in molten HSO and the mixture was directly sprayed on inert nonpareils in a fluid bed chamber. No major interaction between drug and HSO was observed, nevertheless, the drug could be partially dissolved in the molten HSO. Increasing coating amount or adding an inert substance, Aerosil R 972, in the coating mixture reduced the initial burst release as well as the total drug release.

40|$|Several {{thermoanalytical}} {{methods were}} used to assess the compatibility of EBA (copolymer of ethylene and n-butyl acrylate) <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> containing tackifiers of different nature (pentaerythritol rosin ester, polyterpene resin, aliphatic hydrocarbon resin, aromatic hydrocarbon resin, and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon resin). The influence of the compatibility of EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> on their rheological, viscoelastic, and adhesion properties to polar (aluminum foil) and nonpolar (polypropylene film) substrates were analyzed. The viscosity and shear thinning at 160 °C of EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> varied significantly by changing the tackifier nature; however, at 180 °C all EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> showed similar viscosities and shear thinning was absent because of the rupture of physical interactions between their components.

Compatibility was assessed by softening point and cloud point measurement, and dynamical mechanical thermal analysis. The most compatible EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> were obtained with rosin ester, polyterpene and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon tackifiers and they showed the highest tack and adhesion. On the contrary, the less-compatible EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> were obtained with aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon tackifiers, and they showed the lowest adhesion.

This method allows estimation of adsorption (k 1) and desorption (k 2) microrate constants. It was found that k 1 varied exponentially with water activity for the polymeric film showing predictive utility of such a relationship. The dramatic influence that film thickness and temperature may have on water sorption of films has been demonstrated. Results from application of theoretical models and thermodynamic analysis were not always consistent. Established models are useful for quantitative analysis, whereas thermodynamic analysis allows qualitative insights into water-excipient film interaction. Young 2 ̆ 6 Nelson model was successful in accurately modeling the hysteresis phenomena but did not offer any information on the mechanistic details. Computation of isoteric heats of adsorption confirmed hydrogen bonding as the reason for hysteresis and allowed determination of number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule. Comparison of weighted relative partial molal free energies of excipient film and water showed that assumption of adsorbent to be an inert participant in the sorption process as being incorrect for both excipients at all temperatures. In conclusion, (a) <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>coating</b> methods {{are an interesting}} alternative to aqueous coating techniques (b) dynamic vapor sorption is very useful in investigation of water-excipient film interactions, and (c) it is necessary to apply both theoretical models and thermodynamic concepts for complete characterization of water interaction with excipient films...|$|E

Differential scanning calorimetry was used to simulate the coating and tempering conditions prior to the processing and to characterize polymorphic change together with powder X-ray diffractometry and hot stage microscopy. Coated pellets possessed three polymorphic forms of HSO but only the stable form was dominant after tempering. Tempered pellets presented crystal growth of HSO with 1 - 2 mu m microstructure elements. This morphological change led to the reduced porosity and increased surface area of the pellets as well as the increased drug release.
