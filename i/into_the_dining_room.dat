5|$|The {{general layout}} of the home's {{interior}} has remained basically the same throughout the remodelings; the rooms on each floor are accessed via a large central hallway which ends in an elegant rotunda. However, {{some of the changes}} made in 1910 and 1911 did alter the interior appearance. The parlor was converted into the library and the library was converted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> after an extension was added on. In the home's northwest corner a large kitchen was added, on the second-floor, the room above the kitchen became servant's quarters.|$|E

One incident recounted in White's autobiography, was that upon being unsatisfied with the remaining portions of cheese as the Maître'd was attempting to take the trolley <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> for the evening service, the chef threw each cheese in turn {{against the wall of the}} kitchen while berating him for not replacing them.

5|$|Alliance {{with his}} father-in-law, Władysław I the Elbow-high, King of Poland, became a {{permanent}} element of Charles's {{foreign policy in}} the 1320s. After being defeated by the united forces of the Teutonic Knights and John of Bohemia, WładysławI sent his son and heir, Casimir, to Visegrád in late 1329 to seek assistance from Charles. During his stay in Charles's court, the nineteen-year-old Casimir seduced Claire Záh, who was a lady-in-waiting of Charles's wife, Elisabeth of Poland, according to an Italian writer. On 17April 1330, the young lady's father, Felician Záh, stormed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> of the royal palace at Visegrád with a sword in his hand and attacked the royal family. Záh wounded both Charles and the queen on their right hand and attempted to kill their two sons, Louis and Andrew, before the royal guards killed him. Charles's revenge was brutal: with the exception of Claire, Felician Záh's children were tortured to death; Claire's lips and all eight fingers were cut before she was dragged by a horse through the streets of many towns; all of Felician's other relatives within the third degree of kinship (including his sons-in-law and sisters) were executed, and those within the seventh degree were condemned to perpetual serfdom.|$|E

500|$|According to Taylor's recollection, he {{was visiting}} McCartney {{at his home}} in St John's Wood, London, and asked the Beatle how he went about writing a song. In response, McCartney took Taylor <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> where they both sat at a harmonium; McCartney then began playing the {{instrument}} and asked Taylor to call out the opposite to each word he happened to sing. Author Steve Turner writes of the result: [...] "And so it went – black and white, yes and no, stop and go, hello and goodbye." [...] Taylor later reflected: [...] "I've no memory at all of the tune... I wonder whether Paul really made up [...] that song as he went along or whether it was running through his head already." ...|$|E
500|$|From his youth, Sinatra {{displayed}} {{sympathy for}} African Americans and worked both publicly and privately {{all his life}} to help them win equal rights. He blamed racial prejudice on the parents of children. Sinatra {{played a major role}} in the desegregation of Nevada hotels and casinos in the 1950s and 1960s. At the Sands in 1955, Sinatra went against policy by inviting Nat King Cole <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> and in 1961, after an incident where an African-American couple entered the lobby of the hotel and were blocked by the security guard, Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr. forced the hotel management to begin hiring black waiters and busboys. On January 27, 1961, Sinatra played a benefit show at Carnegie Hall for Martin Luther King, Jr. and led his fellow Rat Pack members and Reprise label mates in boycotting hotels and casinos that refused entry to black patrons and performers. According to his son, Frank Sinatra, Jr., King sat weeping in the audience at one of his father's concerts in 1963 as Sinatra sang [...] "Ol' Man River", a song from the musical Show Boat that is sung by an African-American stevedore.

[...] The chairs and tables were made locally as well, of Oregon ash with burl maple veneer.|$|E

John McMahon, one of Owen's sons, said [...] "Four of the five men were dressed in the uniform of the RIC but, from their appearance, I know they are Specials, not regular RIC". All of the men had hidden their faces. The four men in police uniform rushed up the stairs and herded the males <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> The women were taken into another room. Eliza [...] "got down on her knees and pleaded for mercy, but was struck {{on the side of the}} head and fell to the floor". When Owen asked why his family was being singled-out, one of the gunmen said it was because he was [...] "a respected papist".

[...] One {{of the most}} {{important}} events of the Moscow social life was the meeting of the great composer with writers, musicians and philosophers which took place in the Club on May 6, 1843. A famous critic Stepan Shevyrev, who knew Liszt very well through his concerts in Europe and Saint-Petersburg, made a speech of welcome at the banquet. The musician was treated to Russian cuisine. The two-meter sturgeon carried <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> by several men moved Liszt to applause. A real artist of a cook named Vlas, who once served at the house of Pushkin’s uncle, had to come out to the applause. The Sokolov’s choir performance which enraptured Liszt was an inspiration for his studies of gypsy music. He once performed an improvisation on the themes of gypsy songs at a concert in Moscow, and later published an article on the nature of gypsy art in “Le Figaro”.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} entrance {{was formerly}} through the porch {{on the south}} front, but its large doors caused too many draughts.

The overmantel of the fireplace contains sculptures depicting St George slaying the dragon and, on each side, personifications of Hope and Patience, with appropriate inscriptions. [...] The Drawing Room is in a different style from the other rooms on the ground floor, being plastered rather than panelled, and it contains much gilding. [...] The room is devoted to the memory of Rowland Egerton-Warburton and contains a number of family portraits. [...] Its coved ceiling, also designed by Latham, has a frieze depicting birds eating grapes. [...] The final room on the ground floor open to the public is the Small Dining Room. [...] It has a barrel-shaped ceiling, again designed by Latham. [...] In the room is a virginal dated 1675 by Stephen Keene, {{and is one of the}} oldest surviving English keyboard instruments. Its front is decorated with portraits of Charles II and Queen Catherine. [...] The Grand Staircase is considered to be Latham's finest work in the house. The staircase itself and the doorways are made of oak, and the decoration is in plasterwork and strapwork. Above the staircase is a glass-walled domed ceiling.|$|E
