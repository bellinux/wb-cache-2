Some drying tubes have a glass sinter to prevent desiccant falling into the reaction vessel. Drying tubes are often prepared in advance and the desiccant can be replaced when exhausted. Reactions which are being heated, or which evolve gases, must never be sealed because an overpressure may shatter the vessel. Drying tubes are usually fitted on top of the reflux condenser, allowing the pressure to be relieved while excluding atmospheric moisture.|$|E

The ability of the fibres to induce haemolysis in sheep erythrocytes, to release lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from rat alveolar macrophages (AM) and to increase the production of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PML) was studied. To assess the relative cytotoxicity of MMVFs, their toxicity was compared with that induced by quartz, chrysotile or titanium dioxide. MMVFs induced a modest, but dose-dependent, increase of haemolysis at doses of 0. 5, 2. 5 and 5. 0 mg ml" 1. The amount of haemolysis and LDH release induced by MMVFs was generally similar to that induced by titanium dioxide. <b>Glasswool</b> fibre MMVF 10 induced less LDH release from rat AM than rockwool MMVF 21 or slagwool MMVF 22 fibres, whereas <b>glasswool</b> fibre MMVF 11 induced less LDH release than slagwool fibre MMVF 22 (P< 0. 05). All fibres also dose-dependently increased the production of ROMs at doses between 25 and 500 ug ml ~ '. The shapes of the time-courses of MMVF-induced production of ROMs suggest that the mechanisms whereby the different fibres induce ROM production may exhibit similar features.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{investigates the}} {{utilization}} of mineral wool (<b>glasswool</b> and rockwool) as precursor with metakaolin in geopolymerization. In 2015, mineral wool waste in Europe {{is estimated to be}} 2. 4 metric tonnes, and it is currently landfilled. The utilization of this waste in geopolymer composites is one of the motivation towards this study. Indeed, addition of these mineral wools to metakaolin-based geopolymers matrices showed significant improvement in the mechanical properties. The literature section of this thesis describes the previous knowledge on geopolymerization, the materials used in geopolymer and the factors affecting the mechanical strength. In the experimental part, the first goal was to achieve mix composition with highest mechanical strength and also a workable paste of geopolymers. This was done with the following factors held constant: SiO₂/Al₂O₃ = 3. 8 and Na₂O/Al₂O₃ = 1, and varying the following: H₂O/Na₂O from 10 to 13, SiO₂/Na₂O from 3. 21 to 4. 02, mineral wool/metakaolin mass ratio from 0 – 1, and water/binder (w/b) mass ratio from 0. 42 to 0. 55. The different mix compositions was calculated at varying substitution (10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 %) of metakaolin with mineral wool using both <b>glasswool</b> and rockwool in different matrices to determine the effect of mineral wool substitution on the properties of the geopolymer. Mechanical strength tests were done {{to determine the effects of}} mineral wool addition in the geopolymer. Results from the test shows maximum compressive strength of 33 MPa when 20 % of the metakaolin was substituted with mineral wool. Further substitution was observed to reduce the mechanical properties of the geopolymer. Also, optimization of <b>glasswool</b> and rockwool in different compositional mixes was done to select a particular mineral wool to be used further in the course of the study. <b>Glasswool</b> precursor with metakaolin showed better compressive strength using the chosen SiO₂/Al₂O₃ and Na₂O/Al₂O₃-ratios, compared to rockwool and was continued as the co-binder with metakaolin during reinforcement with fibres. Additionally, during the investigation the matrices were cured at various temperatures (50, 60, 80 and 100 °C). Results showed best mechanical strength was achieved when the geopolymer matrices were cured at 50 °C. XRD and TGA where used to characterize the behaviour of the raw materials and geopolymer samples and to verify geopolymer formations and its thermal stability respectively. Geopolymers in general during testing experiences brittle failure, this limitation can be corrected using fibre reinforcement.

40|$|Dissolution of fibers in {{the deep}} lung may involve both {{extracellular}} and intracellular mechanisms. This process was modeled in vitro for each environment using an experimental flow-through system to characterize both total dissolution and specific chemical changes for three representative MMVF's: a <b>glasswool,</b> a slagwool, and a refractory ceramic fiber (RCF). Synthetic physiological fluids at pH 4 and at pH 7. 6 were used to simulate macrophage intraphagolysosomal, and extracellular environments, respectively. Actual commercial fiber, sized to rat-respirable dimension, having an average fiber diameter of 1 pm and an average length between 15 and 25 pm, {{was used in the}} experiments. Fiber dissolution was monitored through change in chemistry of the fluid collected after percolation at a constant rate through a thin bed of sample. There are great differences in total fiber dissolution rates for the different fibers. Slagwool and RCF dissolve more rapidly at pH 4 than at pH 7. 6, while the reverse is true for <b>glasswool.</b> Dissolution is sometimes accompanied by a noticeable change in fiber morphology or dimension, and sometimes by no change. There is strong dependency on pH, which affects not only total fiber dissolution, but also the leaching of specific chemical components. This effect is different for each type of fiber, indicating that specific fiber chemistry largely controls whether a fiber dissolves or leaches more rapidly under acidic or neutral conditions. Both total dissolution rates and calculated fiber composition changes are valuable guides to interpreting in vivo behavior of manmade vitreous fibers, and demonstrate the usefulness of in vitro acellular experiments in understanding overall fiber persistence. - Environ Healt...|$|E

Insulation woods: <b>glasswool</b> (GW), rockwool (RW), slagwool (SW), glass microfibers (GMF), glass filaments (GFiI), and refractory ceramic fibers (RCF) {{have been used}} in experimental animals and in in vitro cell systems. A large heterogeneous number of fibers, methods of fiber preparation, size selection, aerosolization, fiber size, and fiber burden measurement were noted, rendering difficult a comparison between results. By inhalation, RCF and asbestos used as positive controls produced a significant tumor increase. In some studies, a low tumor yield was found after inhalation of insulation wools; when all inhalation data were gathered, a significant tumor increase was found with GW. However, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions on the potential of other fiber types because, in addition to the different compositions of the fibers, differences in fiber number and sizes existed, especially in comparison with asbestos. Moreover, experiments using inoculation, especially by the intraperitoneal route revealed a carcinogenic potential of all fibers types but GFiI and SW. In these two groups a small number of animals has been investigated and the fiber characteristics were sometimes irrelevant. So far, a relationship between the carcinogenic potency and fiber dimensions has been established. Other fiber parameters may be of importance (surface chemistry, biopersistence, fiber structure, for example) but further investigations are necessary to determine the correlations between these parameters and tumor incidence.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the dissolution of}} mineral fibers in simulated physiological fluids (SPF), and the parameters that affect the solubility measurement in a dynamic test where an SPF runs through a cell containing fibers (Scholze and Conradt test). Solutions simulate either the extracellular fluid (pH 7. 6) or the intracellular fluid (pH 4. 5). The fibers have various chemical compositions and are either continuously drawn or processed as wool. The fiber solubility {{is determined by the}} amount of SiO 2 (and occasionally other ions) released in the solution. Results are stated as percentage of the initial silica content released or as dissolution rate v in nm/day. The reproducibility of the test is higher with the less soluble fibers (10 % solubility), than with highly soluble fibers (20 % solubility). The influence of test parameters, including SPF, test duration, and surface area/volume (SA/V), has been studied. The pH and the inorganic buffer salts have a major influence: industrial <b>glasswool</b> composition is soluble at pH 7. 6 but not at pH 4. 5. The opposite is true for rock- (basalt) wool composition. For slightly soluble fibers, the dissolution rate v remains constant with time, whereas for highly soluble fibers, the dissolution rate decreases rapidly. The dissolution rates believed to occur are v 1, initial dissolution rate, and v 2, dissolution rate of the residual fibers. The SA of fibers varies with the mass of the fibers tested, or with the fiber diameter at equal mass. Volume, V, is the chosen flow rate. An increase in the SA/V ratio leads to a decrease in the dissolution rate. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E

At day 204, a piece of omentum was removed at autopsy, ashed and analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) to identify the elements remaining in the fibers. Silicon and aluminium were retained in the fibers from all samples at day 204. Losses in calcium, sodium, magnesium, and sulfur were observed, but these elements were not studied in the urine samples because they are naturally present in relatively high concentrations in rat cells and biological fluids. Although there was a loss of zinc from the glass microfibers, no corresponding difference was observed between the zinc levels excreted by the treated animals and by the controls. Similarly, despite the loss of manganese from the rockwool fibers al day 204, none was detectable in the urine samples. Titanium, present at the 0. 3 % level in rockwool, was not detectable by EDXA at day 204, but small quantities were detected in the first 2 weeks in the urine samples of rats treated with rockwool. The barium content of the retained glass microfibers (JM 100) had decreased at day 204, and this element was detectable in the corresponding urine samples, It was considered that Ti and Ba could be suitable biomarkers of exposure to rockwool and glass microfibers (JM 100) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the influence of convection on the thermal performance of loose-fill attic insulation under realistic climate conditions. In order to achieve this, a large-scale attic test model has been constructed in a climate chamber. Heat flows through the attic floor have been determined with a metering box and temperatures on the upper and lower surface of the attic floor have been measured to detect air movements and to determine the thermal resistance of the attic floor. The performance of the attic test model has been assured by gradually increasing the complexity of the studied attic floor. Measurements have been made both with and without joists, with and without attic ventilation and on rockwool boards, rockwool loose-fill insulation and low-density, <b>glasswool</b> loose-fill insulation. The upper surface of the attic floor has been subjected to conditions representing Swedish winter and the lower surface to indoor conditions. When natural convection occurs, it leads to an increase in heat loss through the insulation and, thus, to a decrease in the thermal resistance of the insulation. A number of factors influence natural convection, such as temperature difference over the attic floor, the thickness of the insulation and permeability of the insulation material. Measurements of natural convection showed that the critical modified Rayleigh number for attic insulation, in the studied set-up, was approximately 22. At a modified Rayleigh number of 34, the thermal resistance of the insulation in the attic test model was only 75 % of that obtained at the onset of convection. This means that there was a substantial increase in heat loss through the insulation due to convection. The measurements of natural convection have been compared to simulations and similar tendencies were obtained. There was no indication of a decrease in the total thermal resistance of the whole attic floor due to attic ventilation...|$|E
