50|$|Another {{use of the}} Sandmeyer {{reaction}} is for cyanation which allows {{for the formation of}} benzonitriles, an important class of organic compounds. A key intermediate in the synthesis of the anti-psychotic drug, <b>Fluanxol,</b> is synthesized by a cyanation through the Sandmeyer reaction.|$|E
50|$|Flupentixol (INN), {{also known}} as {{flupenthixol}} (former BAN), marketed under brand names such as Depixol and <b>Fluanxol</b> is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene class. It was introduced in 1965 by Lundbeck. In addition to single drug preparations, it is also available as flupentixol/melitracenâ€”a combination product containing both melitracen (a tricyclic antidepressant) and flupentixol.Flupentixol is not approved {{for use in the}} United States. It is, however, approved for use in the UK, Australia, Canada, Russian Federation, South Africa, New Zealand, Philippines and various other countries.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} patient with {{proximal}} myotonic myopathy who was treated with neuroleptics because of exacerbating schizophrenia. Under therapy with <b>fluanxol,</b> the patient developed muscle stiffness and oculogyric cramps. Treatment with both amisulpride and olanzapine lead to markedly elevated serum creatine kinase levels. An in-vitro contracture test was positive for halothane. Thus, in patients {{with all kinds of}} multisystemic myotonic myopathies, a susceptibility for malignant hyperthermia and intolerance towards neuroleptics should be taken into account.
