25|$|In April 2006, after a {{headlining}} {{tour with}} Mendeed and <b>God</b> <b>Forbid</b> as openers, Trivium entered {{the studio with}} Suecof and Heafy producing again. The band played the Download Festival for a second time, again on the main stage, with Korn and Metallica. Trivium released The Crusade in October 2006. Debuting at number 25 on the Billboard 200, the album sold over 32,000 copies in its first week of sales. Heafy's vocals had changed from the metalcore scream of the previous albums to actual singing. This new singing style, along with the band's thrash metal music, were criticised as sounding too much like Metallica, who was {{a major influence on}} the band.|$|E

25|$|This is {{something}} that a Muslim gynecologist can tell you {{if you need to}} or not… There used to be a lady who used to do this for women, or, I mean, young girls. She is expected to cut only the tip of the sexual sensitive part in the girl, so that she is not hypersexually active. This is the purpose... you see in societies where circumcision of girls is completely prohibited, hypersexuality takes over the entire society, and a woman is not satisfied with one person, or two, or three. This, <b>God</b> <b>forbid,</b> is now happening even in Muslim societies where they prohibit circumcision. They use a mistake in practice to prohibit the tradition, and they end up causing a lot of damage on the extreme side of the sexual life of the woman.|$|E
25|$|On 26 June 2008, Children of Bodom {{played their}} first show in Auckland, New Zealand {{with support from}} local scene acts Dawn of Azazel and Subtract at the Transmission Room. In 2008, Children of Bodom's first three studio albums, as well as Tokyo Warhearts, were remastered and re-released with bonus tracks. In September and October 2008, the band toured the U.S. {{supporting}} Blooddrunk with support from The Black Dahlia Murder and Between the Buried and Me. Testament also made a special guest appearance in the main support slot at the tour's New York City date. In November and December 2008, the band toured in Europe supporting Slipknot and Machine Head. From late January to early March 2009, the band also co-headlined the European tour with Cannibal Corpse with Diablo opening for them. On 2 April 2009, Children of Bodom embarked on the No Fear Energy Tour headlined by Lamb of God with main support from As I Lay Dying and themselves, and rotating opening slots with <b>God</b> <b>Forbid</b> and Municipal Waste, but dropped off the tour a week before it was finished following a serious injury Alexi suffered after falling from the top bunk of his tour bus on 26 April 2009, after the show in Palladium Ballroom, Dallas, Texas. In addition to the injury, on 8 May 2009, at Roseland Ballroom in New York City, Alexi and Children of Bodom were forced to quit playing after {{a few of their}} songs because of Alexi's previous injury. Laiho originally planned to continue touring despite his injury, but was forced to cancel last six dates when any efforts to alleviate the pain failed. All summer festival dates went down as planned and were unaffected by Alexi's injury.|$|E

In 1987 the couple could no longer afford to live in Spain, so they moved back to London. They lived in a series of rented properties before ending up in a three-room, unfurnished charity flat, where they lived with financial assistance from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. Richard Briers was one of his first visitors at the flat, and was shocked by the change he saw: [...] "itting there, motionless, he was just a mere shadow. A crippled, crushed, shadow.

The band performed this song live, confirming the song's title [...] "No End in Sight". Not long after the album was confirmed, the song was streamed publicly again. In October 2012, with Jesse back at the helm, Killswitch Engage announced they would be celebrating the ten year anniversary of their seminal album Alive or Just Breathing with a US Tour through November/December 2012, in which the band played the album live in its entirety.

500|$|She {{graduated}} from high school in 1918, and began working as a stenographer at a local law office. There she met Bernard Nevelson, co-owner with his brother Charles of the Nevelson Brothers Company, a shipping business. Bernard introduced her to his brother, and Charles and Louise Nevelson were married in June 1920 in a Jewish wedding at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston. Having satisfied her parent's hope that she would marry into a wealthy family, she and her new husband moved to New York City, where she began to study painting, drawing, singing, acting and dancing. She also became pregnant, and in 1922 she gave birth to her son Myron (later called Mike), who grew up to be a sculptor. Nevelson studied art, despite the disapproval of her parents-in-law. She commented: [...] "My husband's family was terribly refined. Within that circle you could know Beethoven, but <b>God</b> <b>forbid</b> if you were Beethoven." ...|$|E

500|$|Musically True Blue was a {{different}} direction for Madonna. Her previous efforts had her singing in a high pitched voice. With this album, Madonna toned it down for a more bubblegum-pop voice. The songs on the album reflect this {{and a number of}} instruments were used in the songs to bring out the different moods which the lyrics emphasized. [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] features acoustic, electric, and rhythm guitars, keyboards, and string arrangements. The song samples Beethoven's Appassionata sonata. A continuous percussion filled structure was used in [...] "Open Your Heart". [...] "White Heat" [...] sampling of the film's quotation was included with speech and gunshots. It is an uptempo dance song with synth bass and double-tracked vocals supported by male voices in the chorus. [...] "I don't write dance music and I don't see it as contributing to the cultural growth of the world," [...] grumbled Pat Leonard in 1992. [...] "At the time we were doing the groove stuff on the True Blue album, it was semi-innovative. There wasn't a precedent that made you gag. <b>God</b> <b>forbid</b> that I might have contributed to the mess we're in now." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrical themes on Dig Me Out {{deal with}} issues of heartbreak and survival. The song [...] "One More Hour" [...] is about the breakup of Tucker and Brownstein's romantic relationship. Before {{the release of the}} album, Spin {{published}} a controversial article discussing Tucker and Brownstein's personal relationship without their permission. Brownstein felt that [...] "it was a complete invasion of privacy. My parents didn't know Corin and I were going out. They didn't know I had ever dated a woman before. It was horrible. I was pissed at Spin, really mad. Luckily my parents are great people, but <b>God</b> <b>forbid</b> I would have some family that would disown me over something like that. And I would have totally held Spin responsible for that." [...] The song features a lot of vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein. Chris Nelson of Addicted to Noise noted that [...] "one can almost hear Tucker crying in the studio as she wails, 'I needed it', while behind her Brownstein offers her attempts at consolation". In her 2015 memoir Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl, Brownstein also states that almost all the songs on Dig Me Out are about either her or Tucker's future husband, Lance Bangs.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Davis of Korn said {{he respects}} Metallica as his {{favorite}} band; he said, [...] "I love that they've done things {{their own way}} and they've persevered {{over the years and}} they're still relevant to this day. I think they're one of the greatest bands ever." [...] Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said Metallica has been the biggest influence on the band, stating, [...] "they really changed my life when I was 16 years oldI'd never heard anything that heavy". Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, The Blackening, [...] "What we mean is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that album Master of Puppetsand the staying powera timeless record like that". Trivium guitarists Corey Beaulieu and Matt Heafy said that when they heard Metallica they wanted to start playing guitar. M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold said touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said, [...] "Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting your idols Metallica". <b>God</b> <b>Forbid</b> guitarists Doc and Dallas Coyle were inspired by Metallica as they grew up, and the band's bassist John Outcalt admires Burton as a [...] "rocker". Ill Niño drummer Dave Chavarri said he finds early Metallica releases are [...] "heavy, raw, rebellious. It said, 'fuck you'", and Adema drummer Kris Kohls said the band is influenced by Metallica.|$|E
