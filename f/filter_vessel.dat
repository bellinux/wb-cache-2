40|$|In this project, a {{computational}} modeling {{approach for}} analyzing flow and ash transport and deposition in filter vessels was developed. An Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for studying hot-gas filtration process was established. The approach uses an Eulerian analysis of gas flows in the <b>filter</b> <b>vessel,</b> and {{makes use of}} the Lagrangian trajectory analysis for the particle transport and deposition. Particular attention {{was given to the}} Siemens-Westinghouse <b>filter</b> <b>vessel</b> at Power System Development Facility in Wilsonville in Alabama. Details of hot-gas flow in this tangential flow <b>filter</b> <b>vessel</b> are evaluated. The simulation results show that the rapidly rotation flow in the spacing between the shroud and the vessel refractory acts as cyclone that leads to the removal of a large fraction of the larger particles from the gas stream. Several alternate designs for the <b>filter</b> <b>vessel</b> are considered. These include a vessel with a short shroud, a <b>filter</b> <b>vessel</b> with no shroud and a vessel with a deflector plate. The hot-gas flow and particle transport and deposition in various vessels are evaluated. The deposition patterns in various vessels are compared. It is shown that certain <b>filter</b> <b>vessel</b> designs allow for the large particles to remain suspended in the gas stream and to deposit on the filters. The presence of the larger particles in the filter cake leads to lower mechanical strength thus allowing for the back-pulse process to more easily remove the filter cake. A laboratory-scale <b>filter</b> <b>vessel</b> for testing the cold flow condition was designed and fabricated. A laser-based flow visualization technique is used and the gas flow condition in the laboratory-scale vessel was experimental studied.

40|$|Early {{observations}} of the Advanced Particulate Filter (APF) at the Tidd PFBC Demonstration Plant led {{to the conclusion that}} tenacious ash deposits formed in the <b>filter</b> <b>vessel</b> and induced stresses that resulted in bent or broken ceramic candle filter elements. The proximity of these bent and broken candle filter elements to large, strong ash deposits emphasized the need to prevent or control the growth of these deposits, facilitate their on-line removal, and/or to develop filter design criteria to minimize their effects on individual filter elements. The chemical characteristics of the ashes collected in the Tidd APF combined with the environment within the <b>filter</b> <b>vessel</b> tend to cause ash deposits formed in the <b>filter</b> <b>vessel</b> to consolidate and strengthen. One theory that may explain the growth and strengthening of these deposits is based on the formation of eutectics such as various calcium aluminosilicate compounds. These eutectics form when primary coal ash particles come into physical contact with sorbent-derived ash particles which contain relatively large amounts of magnesium and/or calcium. Aluminosilicate compounds in the coal ash particles react with alkali metals in the sorbent ash particles to form eutectics that melt at relatively low temperatures. The surface tension of the near-liquid layer on the particles pulls adjacent ash particles closer together, thereby eventually consolidating the structure of the entire ash agglomerate. The optimum solution to the problems caused by the ash aggregates that have been consolidated and strengthened by pervasive eutectic formation is the removal of these aggregates from the APF before the eutectics have had enough time to develop. The approach that proved most successful in eliminating the deposits was the total bypassing of the cyclone upstream of the APF. This increased the size distribution of the particles forming the various ash deposits, thereby decreasing their inherent cohesivity...|$|E

40|$|Two {{different}} {{technologies that}} are being considered for generating electric power {{on a large scale}} by burning coal are Pressurized Fluid Bed Combustion (PFBC) systems and Integrated Gasification and Combined Cycle (IGCC) systems. Particulate emission regulations that have been proposed for future systems may require that these systems be fitted with large scale Hot Gas Clean-Up (HGCU) filtration systems that would remove the fine particulate matter from the hot gas streams that are generated by PFBC and IGCC systems. These hot gas filtration systems are geometrically and aerodynamically complex. They typically are constructed with large arrays of ceramic candle filter elements (CFE). The successful design of these systems require an accurate assessment of the rate at which mechanical energy of the gas flow is dissipated as it passes through the <b>filter</b> containment <b>vessel</b> and the individual candle filter elements that make up the system. Because the filtration medium is typically made of a porous ceramic material having open pore sizes that are much smaller than the dimensions of the containment vessel, the filtration medium is usually considered to be a permeable medium that follows Darcy's law. The permeability constant that is measured in the lab {{is considered to be a}} function of the filtration medium only and is usually assumed to apply equally to all the <b>filters</b> in the <b>vessel</b> as if the flow were divided evenly among all the filter elements. In general, the flow of gas through each individual CFE will depend not only on the geometrical characteristics of the filtration medium, but also on the local mean flows in the <b>filter</b> containment <b>vessel</b> that a particular filter element sees. The flow inside the CFE core, through the system manifolds, and inside the containment vessel itself will be coupled to the flow in the filter medium by various Reynolds number effects. For any given <b>filter</b> containment <b>vessel,</b> since the mean flows are different in different locations inside the vessel, the flow of gas through an individual CFE will adjust itself to accommodate the local mean flows that prevail in its general location.

The direct firing of coal produces particulate matter which must be removed to meet both environmental and process limitations. The ceramic candles increase {{the efficiency of the}} advanced power generation systems and protect downstream equipment from erosion and impingement of particulate matter in the hot exhaust gases. Ceramic candle filters are rigid, closed-ended (capped on one side) porous cylinders which generally have a flange on the open-ended side. The flange at the open end allows the candle to be suspended by a tubesheet in the <b>filter</b> <b>vessel.</b> Candle filters have shown promise, but have also encountered durability problems during use in hostile, high-temperature environments. Limitations in the candle lifetime lower the economic advantages of using candle filters for this application. Candles typically fail by cracking at the flange or {{in the body of the}} candle. The objective of this project was to test and analyze ceramic candle filter materials and to evaluate the degradation mechanisms. The tests were conducted such that the effects of each degradation mechanism could be examined. Separately. The overall objective of the project was to: (a) develop a better understanding of the thermal and chemical degradation mechanisms of ceramic candle filter materials in advanced coal utilization projects, (b) develop test procedures, and (c) recommend changes to increase filter lifetime. 15 refs., 67 figs., 17 tabs...|$|E
40|$|Ceramic filters have {{revealed}} {{to have good}} thermal resistance and chemical corrosion resistance, but they are brittle and lack of toughness, and liable to rupture under large temperature swings. Metallic filters with their high strength and toughness and good heat conduction ability have showed good thermal shock resistance, 310 S and FeAl intermetallic filter elements have exhibited additionally good chemical corrosion resistance in oxidizing and sulfidizing atmosphere(Sawada 1999 and Sunil et al. 1999). The behavior of metallic filter elements at high temperature was investigated and the filtration efficiency of the filter units for hot gas from a coal gasifier unit was tested. Pulse-jet cleaning of filter elements is a key component {{in the operation of}} the filtration unit. The pulse-jet is introduced into the filter element cavities from the clean side, and the dust cakes on the outer surfaces of the filter elements are detached and fall into the <b>filter</b> <b>vessel.</b> Sequential on-line cleaning of filter element groups yields a filter operation with no shutdown for filter regeneration. Development of advanced technologies in the design and operation of the pulse cleaning is one of the important tasks in order to increase the system reliability, to improve the filter life and to increase the filtering performance. The regeneration of filter element in gas filtration at high temperature plays a very important role for the operation of the process. Based on experimental observation and field operation, a numerical model is set up to numerically simulate the momentum and heat transport phenomena in the regeneration process, which is essential for understanding of the process, the optimization of process parameters and improvement of the design of the structure of venturi nozzle and the configuration of the apparatus...|$|E
40|$|In a Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustion (PFBC) /cyclone/filter {{system ground}} coal and sorbent are {{injected}} as pastes into the PFBC bed; the hot gases and entrained fine particles of ash and calcined or reacted sorbent are {{passed through a}} cyclone (which removes the larger entrained particles); and the very-fine particles that remain are then filtered out, so that the cleaned hot gas can be sent through a non-ruggedized hot-gas turbine. The 70 MWe Tidd PFBC Demonstration Plant in Brilliant, Ohio was completed in late 1990. The initial design utilized seven strings of primary and secondary cyclones to remove 98 % of the particulate matter. However, the Plant also included a pressurized <b>filter</b> <b>vessel,</b> placed between the primary and secondary cyclones {{of one of the}} seven strings. Coal and dolomitic limestone (i. e, SO{sub 2 } sorbent) of various nominal sizes ranging from 12 to 18 mesh were injected into the combustor operating at about 10 atm pressure and 925 {degree}C. The cyclone removed elutriated particles larger than about 0. 025 mm, and particles larger than ca. 0. 0005 mm were filtered at about 750 {degree}C by ceramic candle filters. Thus, the chemical reaction times and temperatures, masses of material, particle-size distributions, and chemical compositions were substantially different for particulates removed from the bed drain, the cyclone drain, and the filter unit. Accordingly, we have measured the particle-size distributions and concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sulfur, silicon, and aluminum for material taken from the three units, and also determined the chemical formulas and predominant crystalline forms of the calcium and magnesium sulfate compounds formed. The latter information is particularly novel for the filter-cake material, from which we isolated the ``new`` compound Mg{sub 2 }Ca(SO{sub 4 }) {sub 3 }...|$|E
40|$|Ceramic hot gas candle {{filters are}} {{currently}} under development for hot gas particulate cleanup in advanced coal-based power systems. The ceramic materials for these filters include nonoxide monolithic, nonoxide-fiber-reinforced composites, and nonoxide reticulated foam. A {{concern is the}} lack of reliable data on which to base decisions for reusing or replacing hot gas filters during plant shutdowns. The work in this project is aimed at developing nondestructive evaluation (FIDE) technology to allow detection, and determination of extent, of life-limiting characteristics such as thermal fatigue, oxidation, damage from ash bridging such as localized cracking, damage from local burning, and elongation at elevated temperature. Although in-situ NDE methods are desirable in order to avoid disassembly of the candle <b>filter</b> <b>vessels,</b> the current vessel designs, the presence of filter cakes and possible ash bridging, and the state of NDE technology prevent this. Candle filter producers use a variety of NDE methods to ensure as-produced quality. While impact acoustic resonance offers initial promise for examining new as-produced filters and for detecting damage in some monolithic filters when removed from service, it presents difficulties in data interpretation, it lacks localization capability, and its applicability to composites has yet to be demonstrated. Additional NDE technologies being developed and evaluated in this program and whose applicability to both monolithics and composites has been demonstrated include (a) full-scale thermal imaging for analyzing thermal property variations; (b) fret, high-spatial-resolution X-ray imaging for detecting density variations and dimensional changes; (c) air-coupled ultrasonic methods for determining through-thickness compositional variations; and (d) acoustic emission technology with mechanical loading for detecting localized bulk damage. New and exposed clay-bonded SiC filters and CVI-SiC composite filters have been tested with these additional NDE methods...|$|R
50|$|When red cells {{reach the}} end of their life due to aging or defects, they are removed from the {{circulation}} by the phagocytic activity of macrophages in the spleen or the liver or hemolyze within the circulation. Free hemoglobin is then cleared from the circulation via the hemoglobin transporter CD163, which is exclusively expressed on monocytes or macrophages. Within these cells the hemoglobin molecule is broken up, and the iron gets recycled. This process also produces one molecule of carbon monoxide for every molecule of heme degraded. Heme degradation {{is one of the few}} natural sources of carbon monoxide in the human body, and is responsible for the normal blood levels of carbon monoxide even in people breathing pure air. The other major final product of heme degradation is bilirubin. Increased levels of this chemical are detected in the blood if red cells are being destroyed more rapidly than usual. Improperly degraded hemoglobin protein or hemoglobin that has been released from the blood cells too rapidly can clog small blood vessels, especially the delicate blood <b>filtering</b> <b>vessels</b> of the kidneys, causing kidney damage.Iron is removed from heme and salvaged for later use, it is stored as hemosiderin or ferritin in tissues and transported in plasma by beta globulins as transferrins. When the porphyrin ring is broken up, the fragments are normally secreted as a yellow pigment called bilirubin, which is secreted into the intestines as bile. Intestines metabolise bilirubin into urobilinogen. Urobilinogen leaves the body in faeces, in a pigment called stercobilin. Globulin is metabolised into amino acids that are then released into circulation.|$|R
