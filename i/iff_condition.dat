40|$|Abstract. In quantum {{mechanics}} the statistics of {{the outcomes of}} a measuring apparatus is described by a positive operator valued measure (POVM). A quantum channel transforms POVM’s into POVM’s, generally irreversibly, thus loosing {{some of the information}} retrieved from the measurement.

In this article we consider two popular types of arithmetic inequalities, (X op Y) and (X op C), where X and Y are attributes, C is a constant of the domain or X, and op � {�, �, �, �, �, �}. These inequalities are most frequently used in a database system, inasmuch as the former type of inequality represents a �—join, and the latter is a selection. We study the satisfiability and implication problems under the integer domain and the real domain, as well as under two different operator sets ({�, �, �, �, �} and {�,�,�,�,�,�}). Our results show that solutions under different domains and/or different operator sets are quite different. Out of these eight cases, excluding two cases that had been shown to be NP-hard, we either report the first necessary and sufficient conditions for these problems as well as their efficient algorithms with complexity analysis (for four cases), or provide an improved algorithm (for two cases). These <b>iff</b> <b>conditions</b> and algorithms are essential to database designers, practitioners, and researchers. These algorithms have been implemented and an experimental study comparing the proposed algorithms and those previously known is conducted. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithms are more efficient than previously known algorithms even for small input.

40|$|Component-based {{software}} development has posed {{a serious challenge}} to system verification since externally-obtained components could be {{a new source of}} system failures. This issue can not be completely solved by either model-checking or traditional software testing techniques alone due to several reasons: (1) externally obtained components are usually unspecified/partially specified; (2) it is generally difficult to establish adequacy criteria for testing a component; (3) components may be used to dynamically upgrade a system. This paper introduces a new approach (called modelchecking driven black-box testing) that combines model-checking with traditional black-box software testing to tackle the problem in a complete, sound, and automatic way. The idea is to, with respect to some requirement (expressed in CTL or LTL) about the system, use model-checking techniques to derive a condition (expressed in a communication/witness graph) for an unspecified component such that the system satisfies the requirement <b>iff</b> the <b>condition</b> is satisfied by the component. The condition’s satisfiability can be established by testing the component with test-cases generated from the condition on-the-fly.

40|$|Path {{diversity}} {{works by}} setting up multiple parallel connections between the end points using the topological path redundancy of the network. In this paper, Forward Error Correction (FEC) is applied across multiple independent paths to enhance the endto-end reliability. Internet paths are modeled as erasure Gilbert-Elliot channels [1], [2]. First, it is shown that over any erasure channel, Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes achieve the minimum probability of irrecoverable loss among all block codes of the same size. Then, based on the adopted model for Internet paths, we prove that the probability of irrecoverable loss for MDS codes decays exponentially for the asymptotically large number of paths. Moreover, it is shown that in the optimal rate allocation, each path is assigned a positive rate iff its quality is above a certain threshold. The quality of a path {{is defined as the}} percentage of the time it spends in the bad state. In other words, including a redundant path improves the reliability <b>iff</b> this <b>condition</b> is satisfied. Finally, using dynamic programming, a heuristic suboptimal algorithm with polynomial runtime is proposed for rate allocation over the available paths. This algorithm converges to the asymptotically optimal rate allocation when the number of paths is large. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm approximates the optimal rate allocation very closely for the practical number of paths, and provides significant performance improvement compared to the alternative schemes of rate allocation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Nonimprovable, in general, {{estimates}} of the number of necessary and sufficient conditions for two Hermitian operators to be unitarily equaivalent in a unitary space are obtained when the multiplicities of eigenvalues of operators can be more than 1. The explicit form of these conditions is given. In the Appendix the concept of conditionally functionally independent functions is given and the corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions are presented. Let P, Q be the operators from a unitary n-dimensional space U n in U n, and P, Q be the matrices of these operators in some orthonormal basis. Description of a system of invariants of these matrices which enables one to find out whether the given operators are unitarily equivalent is the classical problem of the theory of invariants (see, e. g., [1, § 2. 2], [2] and the references cited therein). In the author’s paper [3] it is shown that two matricess P, Q ∈ Mn(C) are unitarily equivalent <b>iff</b> the following <b>conditions</b> are fulfilled: tr { P l +P−P m + P 2 }...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the effects of}} lexical {{information}} in processing left clause boundaries in Japanese. Miyamoto (2002) proposed a mechanism in which the parser creates a left clause boundary before it processes a verb by using information of case-markers. I claim that the parser uses not only information of case-markers but also lexical information in processing left clause boundaries in Japanese. A self-paced reading experiment is conducted to verify this claim. The results are not easily reconcilable with a model that uses chiefly information of case-markers in processing left clause boundaries but fit with a model where left clause boundaries are created on lexical information in addition to information of case-markers. As for a mechanism in which the parser uses lexical information, I claim that the parser refers to a tentative theta-role (TTR), which was proposed by Sakamoto & Walenski (1998), {{and the creation of}} a left clause boundary is restricted by the sequence of case-markings and TTRs.

40|$|We prove {{a version}} of the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing, which applies to Kabanov’s {{approach}} to foreign exchange markets under transaction costs. The financial market is modelled by a d × d matrix-valued stochastic process (Σt) Tt= 0 specifying the mutual bid and ask prices between d assets. We introduce the notion of “robust no arbitrage”, which is {{a version of}} the no arbitrage concept, robust with respect to small changes of the bid ask spreads of (Σt) Tt= 0. Dually, we interpret a concept used by Kabanov and his co-authors as “strictly consistent price systems”. We show that this concept extends the notion of equivalent martingale measures, playing a well-known role in the frictionless case, to the present setting of bid-ask processes (Σt) Tt= 0. The main theorem states that the bid-ask process (Σt) Tt= 0 satisfies the robust no arbitrage <b>condition</b> <b>iff</b> it admits a strictly consistent pricing system.

40|$|To {{predict the}} {{location}} {{of natural resources and}} reduce the cost of exploration, geophysicists rely on various techniques to map the internal structure of the earth. One common mapping method probes the earth's interior using an acoustic energy source (sound waves). The acoustic waves reflect when they impinge on a location where the acoustic velocity field oscillates rapidly (on the scale of a wavelength). When the waves reflect back to the surface, they carry kinematical information about {{the location of}} the oscillatory velocity field. A linearized wave equation models the scattering process and its solution operator is a Fourier integral operator. As such, the scattering operator has a canonical relation Λ which describes how the operator maps oscillatory velocity fields to oscillatory wave fields at the surface. The goal of linearized inversion is to obtain an inverse operator (with inverse canonical relation) for the scattering operator. We give a geometrical condition on Λ that is equivalent to the existence of a linearized inversion operator. Since the L 2 -adjoint of the scattering operator has inverse canonical relation, geophysicists often apply it to the scattered field to obtain a map of the subsurface. I analyze the scattering operator using high-frequency asymptotics and show that if the geometrical condition fails, the scattering canonical relation is not injective. Therefore, application of the adjoint operator to the scattered wave field can produce artifacts in the resulting map of the subsurface. I demonstrate this effect numerically. I also prove that the scattering operator is continuous between a certain domain and range space <b>iff</b> the geometrical <b>condition</b> on Λ holds. Furthermore, I have shown {{that it is possible to}} map an experiment where the geometrical condition fails into another experiment where it holds...|$|R
