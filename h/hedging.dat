5|$|Before its scandal, Enron was lauded for its {{sophisticated}} {{financial risk}} management tools. Risk management was crucial to Enron {{not only because of}} its regulatory environment, but also because of its business plan. Enron established long-term fixed commitments which needed to be hedged to prepare for the invariable fluctuation of future energy prices. Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and special purpose entities. By <b>hedging</b> its risks with special purpose entities which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions. This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.|$|E

No-till cotton with grass <b>hedges,</b> no-till cotton without grass <b>hedges,</b> conventional-till cotton with grass <b>hedges,</b> and conventional-till cotton without grass <b>hedges</b> produced four-year average annual soil losses of 1. 8, 2. 9, 4. 0, and 30. 8 t/ha, respectively, and produced four-year average runoff amounts of 226, 364, 338, and 738 mm, respectively. The ratio of annual soil loss with grass <b>hedges</b> to without <b>hedges</b> averaged 0. 62 for no-till. The ratio of annual soil loss with grass <b>hedges</b> to without <b>hedges</b> was 0. 13 for conventional-till. Averaged over all plots (with and without grass <b>hedges),</b> no-till plots reduced soil loss from conventional-till plots by 86 %. No-till plots without grass <b>hedges</b> had 90 % less soil loss than conventional-till plots without grass <b>hedges.</b> Grass <b>hedges</b> effectively reduced soil loss on erosion plots with similar cropping practices {{as compared to}} plots without <b>hedges.</b> Other studies of contoured grass <b>hedges</b> on field-sized areas are being conducted to determine their applicability on larger areas with greater concentrations of runoff...|$|R

We investigated the response of farmland vs. woodland birds at two degrees of isolation of <b>hedges</b> from forest and to vegetation structure. We surveyed 200 m long sections of six forest edges, six <b>hedges</b> connected to forests and six isolated <b>hedges.</b> Species richness and abundance of farmland birds were higher in <b>hedges</b> than in forest edges, species richness and abundance of woodland birds were lower in <b>hedges</b> than in the forest edges. Species richness and abundance of both groups did not differ between connected and isolated <b>hedges.</b> Width and height of <b>hedges</b> and edges did not affect the species richness and abundance of either farmland or woodland birds. Furthermore, bird community composition differed between habitat types (<b>hedge</b> vs. forest edge) and also between <b>hedge</b> isolation levels (<b>hedges</b> connected to forest vs. isolated <b>hedges).</b> Based on our results, we emphasize the importance of <b>hedges</b> in conserving farmland birds and encourage policy makers to support <b>hedge</b> creation and maintenance with landscape-wide management strategies supporting a diverse <b>hedge</b> structure. Both connected and isolated <b>hedges</b> play an important role as they harbour different bird communities...|$|R

Reasons for pre-booking include wanting one's ashes to be close to those of loved ones, and <b>hedging</b> against higher prices for niches in future. The bodies of foreigners (regardless of where they die) can be cremated in Singapore, but their ashes have to be placed in private columbaria.

5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate (also referred to as forward rate or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for <b>hedging</b> purposes. The {{forward exchange}} rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{is forced}} to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) set up Kelly and Ravi, CeCe's pediatrician, in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several {{attempts}} to get back with Kelly, though everyone finds the attempts pathetic because he can not even say he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits he would prefer she not be with anyone else if she {{is not going to be}} with him. Pam eventually says that he is not a nice person, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly <b>hedging</b> terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem. Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Tearing up, Jim informs the camera crew that Ryan can never know of the incident.|$|E

5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at which}} a commercial bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The {{forward exchange}} rate is a type of forward price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract to lock in a {{forward exchange rate}}. <b>Hedging</b> with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E
