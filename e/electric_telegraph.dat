5|$|The 1852, the Isle of Wight Electric Company laid a specially-armoured {{telegraph}} cable {{to link the}} castle with Keyhaven on the mainland and Sconce Point on the island; two years later, the <b>Electric</b> <b>Telegraph</b> Company linked the castle to Southampton. Hurst used flags to pass on telegraphic messages to and from shipping entering the Solent.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>electric</b> <b>telegraph</b> network expanded, {{allowing}} for the more rapid dissemination of warnings, a national observational network was developed, which could then be used to provide synoptic analyses. Instruments to continuously record variations in meteorological parameters using photography were supplied to the observing stations from Kew Observatory – these cameras had been invented by Francis Ronalds in 1845 and his barograph had earlier been used by FitzRoy.|$|E
5|$|The {{inventor}} of the <b>electric</b> <b>telegraph,</b> Francis Ronalds, lived on Chiswick Lane from 1833 to 1852. Another engineer, John Edward Thornycroft was born in Chiswick in 1872; his father, John Isaac Thornycroft, had founded the Chiswick-based John I. Thornycroft & Company shipbuilding company in 1864, which Thornycroft later joined and developed. The artist Montague Dawson, {{regarded as one of}} the best 20th-century painters of the sea, was born in Chiswick in 1895.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{invention}} of the <b>electric</b> <b>telegraph</b> in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began. Before that, the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 100 miles per day (160km/d), but was more typically 40–75 miles per day (60–120km/day) (whether by land or by sea). By the late 1840s, the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously, allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further upwind.|$|E
5|$|The first chess match by <b>electric</b> <b>telegraph</b> {{took place}} in 1844, between Washington and Baltimore. In April 1845 Staunton and Captain Kennedy {{travelled}} to Gosport to play two games by telegraph against a group in London. Staunton took a long-term interest in this solution to the difficulties of travel, and reported telegraph games in The Illustrated London News. In 1871 his report of a telegraphic match between Sydney and Adelaide calculated that the 74 moves of the longest game had travelled a total of 220,000miles (not {{much less than the}} distance between Earth and Moon).|$|E

Even in the Civil War, the wigwag system, restricted to line-of-sight communications, was waning in the face of the <b>electric</b> <b>telegraph.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In the United States {{the first}} optical {{telegraph}} {{was built by}} Jonathan Grout. It was a 104 km line connecting Martha's Vineyard with Boston, and its purpose was to transmit news about shipping. One of the principal hills in San Francisco, California is also named [...] "Telegraph Hill", after the semaphore telegraph which was established there in 1849 to signal the arrival of ships into San Francisco Bay. The semaphores were successful enough that Samuel Morse failed to sell the electrical telegraph to the French government; however, France finally committed to replace semaphores with <b>electric</b> <b>telegraphs</b> in 1846. <b>Electric</b> <b>telegraphs</b> are both more private and almost completely unaffected by weather; they also work at night. Many contemporaries predicted the failure of <b>electric</b> <b>telegraphs</b> because [...] "they are so easy to cut." [...] The last stationary semaphore link in regular service was in Sweden, connecting an island with a mainland telegraph line. It went out of service in 1880.|$|R

25|$|The <b>electric</b> <b>telegraph,</b> in {{addition}} to visual signaling, became a Signal Corps responsibility in 1867. Within 12 years, the corps had constructed, and was maintaining and operating, some 4,000 miles of telegraph lines along the country's western frontier.|$|E
25|$|Wheatstone {{abandoned}} {{his idea of}} transmitting intelligence by the mechanical vibration of rods, and took up the <b>electric</b> <b>telegraph.</b> In 1835 he lectured on the system of Baron Schilling, and declared that the means were already known by which an <b>electric</b> <b>telegraph</b> could be made of great service to the world. He made experiments with a plan of his own, and not only proposed to lay an experimental line across the Thames, but to establish it on the London and Birmingham Railway. Before these plans were carried out, however, he received a visit from Mr William Fothergill Cooke at his house in Conduit Street on 27 February 1837, which had an important influence on his future.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of the telegraph had so far advanced that, on 2 September 1845, the <b>Electric</b> <b>Telegraph</b> Company was registered, and Wheatstone, by his deed of partnership with Cooke, received a sum of £33,000 {{for the use of}} their joint inventions.|$|E
25|$|From this point, {{the use of}} the <b>electric</b> <b>telegraph</b> {{started to}} grow on the new {{railways}} being built from London. The London and Blackwall Railway (another rope-hauled application) was equipped with the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph when it opened in 1840, and many others followed. The one-needle telegraph proved highly successful on British railways, and 15,000 sets were still in use {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century. Some remained in service in the 1930s. In September 1845, the financier John Lewis Ricardo and Cooke formed the <b>Electric</b> <b>Telegraph</b> Company, the first public telegraphy company in the world. This company bought out the Cooke and Wheatstone patents and solidly established the telegraph business.|$|E

[...] She also notes that visitors [...] "could watch the entire process of cotton production from spinning to finished cloth. Scientific instruments were found in class X, and included <b>electric</b> <b>telegraphs,</b> microscopes, air pumps and barometers, as well as musical, horological and surgical instruments." ...|$|R

50|$|When the Earl of Derby became Prime Minister in February 1852, Montrose was {{appointed}} Lord Steward of the Household, a post he retained until the government fell in December {{of the same}} year. He again served under Derby as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster between 1858 and 1859 and under Derby and later Benjamin Disraeli as Postmaster General between 1866 and 1868, although he was never {{a member of the}} cabinet. As Postmaster-General he introduced the <b>Electric</b> <b>Telegraphs</b> Bill which resulted in the transfer of British telegraph companies to the Post Office.|$|R
25|$|The Russian–American Telegraph, {{also known}} as the Western Union Telegraph Expedition and the Collins Overland Telegraph, was a $3,000,000 (equivalent to $ in present-day terms) {{undertaking}} by the Western Union Telegraph Company in 1865–1867, to lay an <b>electric</b> <b>telegraph</b> line from San Francisco, California to Moscow, Russia.|$|E
25|$|Brunel {{was quick}} to see the {{possible}} advantages of the early <b>electric</b> <b>telegraph</b> system for use in running the railway. In 1838 he persuaded Sir Charles Wheatstone and William Fothergill Cooke to install their five-needle telegraph system between Paddington Station and West Drayton and to carry out experiments. It proved to be useful, so the viaduct thus carried the world's first commercial electrical telegraph, on 9 April 1839.|$|E

50|$|The Mount Morris Park tower {{went into}} service in 1857 in {{response}} to Harlem residents’ demand. The towers gave volunteers a perch from which to watch for fires that were common in the wooden structures that then made up much of New York City, and the watchers then spread the word via bell ringing. Later, <b>electric</b> <b>telegraphs</b> were installed but the bell provided local alarms. When pull boxes and other technological advances rendered the fire watchtowers obsolete, the system was discontinued and the other towers eventually were destroyed. Harlem’s, protected {{in the middle of}} a park, endured.|$|R
