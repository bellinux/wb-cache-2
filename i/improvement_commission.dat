25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the reason}} for employing keelmen was the poor state of the navigation on the Tyne and Wear, which prevented ships from moving up river without danger of grounding. As time went by this situation gradually worsened. Colliers arriving at the river mouth would have a ballast of sand {{that had to be}} disposed of. The correct method of doing this was to deposit the sand on specified areas on the riverbank provided for the purpose or by depositing the sand in the sea. The Wear had ballast keels that were used to unload the ballast from colliers and take it out to sea. There were penalties for depositing ballast in the river, but this often occurred. The result was that the riverbed became silted up, causing even more navigational difficulties. Additionally, industry on the riverbanks often deposited its waste products in the river. The situation on the Tyne became so bad that in 1850 the Tyne Navigation Act was passed, which gave control of the river to the Tyne <b>Improvement</b> <b>Commission.</b> This body began an extensive program of dredging to substantially deepen the riverbed. This program was completed in 1888 so that the largest colliers could pass right up to Newcastle and beyond. This deepening of the river meant that colliers could load coal from the staithes without the need for keels to complete the work. In 1876 the existing bridge at Newcastle was replaced by the Swing Bridge, which rotated to allow ships to pass up and down river. This allowed colliers to be loaded from staithes above Newcastle and so further sealed the fate of the keelmen.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} Commission was revived in 1810, {{and later}} in the decade Sheffield finally {{followed}} the model adopted by several other towns in petitioning for an Act to establish an <b>Improvement</b> <b>Commission.</b> This eventually led to the Sheffield Improvement Act 1818, which established the Commission and included several other provisions. In 1832 the town gained political representation with the formation of a Parliamentary borough. A municipal borough was formed by an Act of Incorporation in 1843, and this borough was granted the style and title of [...] "City" [...] by Royal Charter in 1893.|$|E
500|$|Consequently, in 1846 an Act of Parliament {{authorised}} {{the building}} of a new toll bridge on the site of an ancient ford exactly [...] downstream of Battersea Bridge. The approach road on the southern side was to run {{along the side of the}} new park, while that on the northern side was to run from Sloane Square, through the former Chelsea Waterworks site, to the new bridge. Although previous toll bridges in the area had been built and operated by private companies, the new bridge was to be built and operated by the government, under the control of the Metropolitan <b>Improvement</b> <b>Commission,</b> despite protests in Parliament from Radicals objecting to the Government profiting from a toll-paying bridge. It was intended that the bridge would be made toll-free once the costs of building it had been recouped.|$|E

2500|$|The {{conservation}} of the Tyne has been handled by various bodies {{over the past}} 500 years. Conservation bodies have included: Newcastle Trinity House, and the Tyne <b>Improvement</b> <b>Commission.</b> The Tyne <b>Improvement</b> <b>Commission</b> conservation lasted from 1850 until 1968. The 1850-1950 era was the worst period for pollution of the river. The Tyne <b>Improvement</b> <b>Commission</b> laid the foundations for what has become the modern day Port of Tyne. Under {{the management of the}} Tyne Improvement Commissioners, over a period of the first 70 years the Tyne was deepened from 1.83 to 9.14 meters and had 150 million tonnes dredged from it. Inside these 70 years, the two Tyne piers were built; Northumbrian, Tyne and Albert Docks were built as well as the staithes at Whitehill and Dunston. This infrastructure enabled millions of tonnes of cargo to be handled by the Port by 1910. As of [...] the tidal river is now managed by the Port of Tyne Authority, and has been managed by the Port of Tyne Authority since 1968.|$|E
2500|$|In 1901, the Senate Park <b>Improvement</b> <b>Commission</b> of the District of Columbia (the [...] "McMillan Commission"), which Congress {{had formed}} the {{previous}} year, formulated the McMillan Plan, an architectural {{plan for the}} redevelopment of the National Mall. The commission was inspired by L'Enfant's 1791 plan for the city, which had not been fully realized. The members of the commission also sought to emulate the grandeur of European capitals such as Paris, London, and Rome. They were also strongly influenced by the City Beautiful movement, a Progressive ideology that intended to build civic virtue in the poor through important, monumental architecture. Several of the Commission members, including Daniel Burnham and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. had in fact participated in the 1893 World Columbian Exposition, which was widely popular and helped to spread interest in the City Beautiful movement.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{several other}} {{national}} capitals, such as Paris and Washington, D.C., Ottawa was never built to a master plan. However, several commissions {{have played a}} role in determining the shape of the city. Colonel By envisioned building several grand boulevards but the difficulties of expropriation and demolition prevented this from happening. In the late 1880s, Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier developed a 50-year vision of the city's future development and created the Ottawa <b>Improvement</b> <b>Commission</b> (OIC). The early years of the OIC under the direction of Montreal-born architect Frederick Todd saw the removal of industry along the canal, [...] the definition of Patterson Creek and the transfer of Rockcliffe Park to the federal government. In 1913, Sir Robert Borden appointed the Sir Henry Holt Commission which was the first to state the need for a national capital region and also the removal of railway lines from the downtown core.|$|E

2500|$|Ottawa's former {{industrial}} {{appearance was}} vastly altered by the 1950 Greber Plan. Prime Minister Mackenzie King hired French architect-planner Jacques Greber to design an urban plan for managing {{development in the}} National Capital Region, {{to make it more}} aesthetically pleasing and thus more befitting a location serving as Canada's political centre. Greber's plan included the creation of the National Capital Greenbelt, the Parkway, the Queensway highway system, the relocation of downtown Union Station (now the Government Conference Centre) to the suburbs, the removal of the street car system, the decentralization of selected government offices, the relocation of industries and removal of substandard housing from the downtown and the creation of the Rideau Canal and Ottawa River pathways {{to name just a few}} of its recommendations. In 1958 the National Capital Commission was established as a Crown Corporation from the passing of the National Capital Act to implement the Greber Plan recommendations-which it successfully accomplished during the 1960s and 1970s. In the previous 50 years, other commissions, plans and projects had failed to implement plans to improve the capital such as the 1899 Ottawa <b>Improvement</b> <b>Commission</b> (OIC), The Todd Plan in 1903, The Holt Report in 1915 and The Federal District Commission (FDC) established in 1927. In 1958 a new City Hall opened on Green Island near Rideau falls where urban renewal had recently transformed this former industrial location into green space. Until then, City Hall had temporarily been located for 27 years (1931–1958) at the Transportation Building adjacent to Union Station and now part of the Rideau Centre. In 2001, Ottawa City Hall moved back downtown to a relatively new building (1990) on 110 Laurier Avenue West, the prior home of the now defunct Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton. This new downtown location was very close to Ottawa's first (1849–1877) and second (1877–1931) City Halls. [...] This new city hall complex also contained an adjacent 19th century restored heritage building formerly known as the Ottawa Normal School.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{organisational}} improvement approach in NHS commissioning using the principles of continuous improvement and Lean. This report presents the development and installation of a novel NHS <b>Commissioning</b> <b>Improvement</b> Framework (CIF) within a primary care trust context and evaluates the impacts made in practice. Through a programme of action research, this study has been able to show how the principles of Lean can be introduced into the day-to-day practice of a commissioning organisation and deliver measurable benefits to both patient and the organisation through the application of the CIF. For the past two decades (DH, 2000), it could be argued that the improvement agenda in the NHS has been the 'silent' partner in delivering performance targets; focusing efforts on improving access to treatment In my experience, the basic fundamental of improving patient experience has been overshadowed by the performance agenda. In recent years, there has also been a drive for <b>improvement</b> from a <b>commissioning</b> perspective. However, <b>improvement</b> processes are more suited to the needs of healthcare providers, thus commissioner-orientated improvement methodologies are somewhat lacking. The major contribution made by this study is a new <b>commissioning</b> <b>improvement</b> model (the CIF) that integrates the principles of continuous improvement and Lean into NHS commissioning. Structured into three main domains: Position, Process and Drivers, the new model highlights the importance of a high degree of workforce engagement and staff development. The action research process used was an intuitive part of the change process and provided a prospective view of what was required to further embed <b>improvement</b> into <b>commissioning</b> practice. Complemented by a programme of practice development and classroom education; an increase in workforce improvement understanding and capability has been seen to deliver a number of measured improvements for both patient services and commissioning organisation alike.
