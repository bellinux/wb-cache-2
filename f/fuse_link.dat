50|$|Cutouts are {{typically}} mounted about 20 degrees off vertical {{so that the}} center of gravity of the fuse holder is displaced and the fuse holder will rotate and fall open under its own weight when the fuse blows. Mechanical tension on the <b>fuse</b> <b>link</b> normally holds an ejector spring in a stable position. When the fuse blows, the released spring pulls the stub of the <b>fuse</b> <b>link</b> out of the fuse holder tube to reduce surge duration and damage to the transformer and fuse holder. This quenches any arc in the fuse holder.|$|E
50|$|The LSI-1 was {{superseded}} by the LSI-2 which implemented the same architecture using standard TTL logic. The LSI-2 comprised a single full card with two piggyback half cards, on the lefthand side {{viewed from the}} back was the card containing the microcode in <b>fuse</b> <b>link</b> bipolar Proms, on the right the options card with the bootstrap Proms and serial interface for current loop teletype or RS. 232 device. There {{were a couple of}} speed options of processor available, the 2/10 with a 10 MHz clock and 2/20 with a 20 MHz clock. Another option was the 2/60 which used different microcode on the half card to support an enhanced instruction set used uniquely by Computer Automation’s SyFa (System For access) data processing systems. There were two types of console available, the operators console which merely had enough functionality to enable an operator to boot the system, and a programmer’s console which would enable data entry for bootstrap routines, etc. Memory options included magnetic core of between 4 and 16k and later semiconductor memory of up to 32k in a variety of formats, full card and half card. Memory banking where blocks of memory could be switched in or out to a degree bypassed the restrictions of a 16 bit address buss. The buss format for input output devices remained the same as Alpha 8 and Alpha 16 therefore many of the I/O devices for the earlier product could still be used. However the LSI 2 had a different dual card hard disk controller and a number of different options for half card floppy controllers. The chassis available was a five slot with internal PSU or nine slot with external PSU.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid polymer-network gels {{built by}} both {{physical}} and covalent polymer crosslinking combine the advantages of both these crosslinking types: they exhibit high mechanical strength along with excellent fracture toughness and extensibility. If these materials are extensively deformed, their physical crosslinks can break such that strain energy is dissipated and irreversible fracturing is restricted to high strain only. This mechanism of energy dissipation {{is determined by the}} kinetics and thermodynamics of the physical crosslinking contribution. In this paper, we present a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) based material toolkit to control these contributions in a rational and custom fashion. We form well-defined covalent polymer-network gels with regularly distributed additional supramolecular mechanical <b>fuse</b> <b>links,</b> whose strength of connectivity can be tuned without affecting the primary polymer-network composition. This is possible because the supramolecular <b>fuse</b> <b>links</b> are based on terpyridine–metal complexation, such that the mere choice of the fuse-linking metal ion adjusts their kinetics and thermodynamics of complexation–decomplexation, which directly affects the mechanical properties of the hybrid gels. We use oscillatory shear rheology to demonstrate this rational control and enhancement of the mechanical properties of the hybrid gels. In addition, static light scattering reveals their highly regular and well-defined polymer-network structures. As a result of both, the present approach provides an easy and reliable concept for preparing hybrid polymer-network gels with rationally designed properties...|$|R

5000|$|A {{lightning}} rod (or lightning protector) is a metal strip or rod connected to earth through conductors and a grounding system, {{used to provide}} a preferred pathway to ground if lightning terminates on a structure. The class of these products are often called a [...] "finial" [...] or [...] "air terminal". A {{lightning rod}} or [...] "Franklin rod" [...] in honor of its famous inventor, Benjamin Franklin, is simply a metal rod, and without being connected to the lightning protection system, as was sometimes {{the case in the}} old days, will provide no added protection to a structure. Other names include [...] "lightning conductor", [...] "arrester", and [...] "discharger"; however, over the years these names have been incorporated into other products or industries with a stake in lightning protection. Lightning arrester, for example, often refers to <b>fused</b> <b>links</b> that explode when a strike occurs to a high voltage overhead power line to protect the more expensive transformers down the line by opening the circuit.

40|$|Background and purpose: Multi-atlas {{segmentation}} {{can yield}} better results than single atlas segmentation, but practical applications {{are limited by}} long calculation times for deformable registration. To shorten the calculation time pre-calculated registrations of atlases could be linked via a single atlas registered in runtime to the current patient. The primary purpose of this work is to investigate and quantify segmentation quality changes introduced by such linked registrations. We also determine the optimal parameters for <b>fusing</b> <b>linked</b> multi-atlas labels using probabilistic weighted fusion. Material and methods: Computed tomography images of 10 head and neck cancer patients were used as atlases, with parotid glands, submandibular glands, the mandible and lymph node levels II-IV segmented by an experienced radiation oncologist following published consensus guidelines. The change in segmentation quality scored by Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for linking free-form deformable registrations, modeled by B-splines, was investigated for both single-and multi-atlas label fusion by using a leave-one-out approach. Results: The median decrease of the DSC was in the range 2. 8 % to 8. 4 % compared to direct registrations for all structures while reducing the computer calculation time {{to that of a}} single deformable registration. Linking several registrations showed a DSC decrease almost linear to the number of links, suggesting that extrapolation to zero links provides an observer independent measure of the inherent precision with which the segmentation guidelines can be applied. Conclusions: Linking pre-made registrations of multiple atlases via a runtime registration of a single atlas provides a feasible method for reducing computation time in multi-atlas registration...|$|R
