A mouse model was successfully established to investigate the effects on the aortic valve in subjects with elevated 5 HT levels along with cardiovascular hypertension. For each two-week trial, eight C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were divided into the following expermental groups: control, 5 HT, angiotensin II, and 5 HT+angiotensin II. The drug was delivered to the mice via osmotic pumps (Ang II: 0. 4 ng/g/min, 5 HT: 0. 0025 ng/g/min) or direct injections(Ang II: 0. 1 mg, 5 HT: 2. 12 mg, every other day) and the blood pressure of the mice was continually monitored via the CODA tail cuff system. The direct injection model {{was determined to be}} a more effective model as the drug delivery was more controllable and there were far less adverse events with the mice.

40|$|Herein {{we present}} a {{methodology}} for improving the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells made by photoactive layers of poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) and phenyl-C 61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) of non-optimized microstructure. In our study we achieve a 47 % improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device by utilizing a thiophene-based quinoid (QBT) moiety as the third component in the P 3 HT:PCBM:QBT photoactive layers. Based {{on a set of}} independent characterization experiments we address the QBT composition dependent photophysical, electrical, thermal, structural and morphology-related properties of the ternary photovoltaic P 3 HT:PCBM:QBT system for elucidating the origin of the PCE improvement. In small amounts (0. 3 - 0. 6 wt%), QBT serves as a nucleation agent, it enlarges the size of the P 3 HT crystallites by 15 % and it increases the fraction of well-ordered P 3 HT chains in the P 3 HT:PCBM:QBT layer. The improved microstructure of the photoactive layer in combination with the QBT-assisted photo-induced hole transfer step from PCBM to P 3 <b>HT,</b> <b>lead</b> to an increase of the charge photogeneration yield in the P 3 HT:PCBM:QBT triple bulk heterojunction. The relatively small optical gap of QBT facilitates a resonant energy transfer step from the photoexcited PCBM to the QBT followed by a charge transfer process between QBT and the P 3 HT matrix. Based on these findings we propose general guidelines for the design of next generation functional additives to be used in organic photovoltaics. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|An organic {{solar cell}} based on a bulk {{heterojunction}} (BHJ) of a polymer and a methanofullerene ([60]PCBM or [70]PCBM) exhibits a complex morphology that controls both its photovoltaic and mechanical compliance (robustness, flexibility, and stretchability). Methanofullerenes are excellent electron acceptors; however, they have relatively high cost and production energy (in the purest samples) compared to other small-molecule semiconductors. Moreover, [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM-typical of van der Waals solids-can be stiff and brittle. Stiffness and brittleness may lower the yield of working modules in roll-to-roll manufacturing, shorten the lifetime against mechanical failure in outdoor conditions, and jeopardize wearable and portable applications that demand stretchability or extreme flexibility. This paper tests the hypothesis that technical grade PCBM (incompletely separated but otherwise pure blends containing >= 90 % [60]PCBM or [70]PCBM) could {{lower the cost of}} manufacturing {{organic solar cell}}s while simultaneously increasing their mechanical stability. Measurements of the tensile modulus of five methanofullerene samples, technical grades and 99 % grades of both [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM, and a 1 : 1 mixture [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM, along with their blends with regioregular poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 <b>HT),</b> <b>lead</b> to two important conclusions: (1) films of pure [70]PCBM are approximately five times more compliant than films of pure [60]PCBM; BHJ films with [70]PCBM are also more compliant than those with [60]PCBM. (2) BHJ films comprising technical grades of [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM are approximately two to four times more compliant than are films made using 99 % grades. Tensile modulus is found to be an excellent predictor of brittleness: BHJs produced with technical grade methanofullerene accommodate strains 1. 4 - 2. 2 times greater than those produced with 99 % grades. The smallest range of stretchability was found for BHJs with 99 % [60]PCBM (fracture at 3. 5 % strain), while the greatest was found for technical grade [70]PCBM (11. 5 % strain). Mechanical properties are correlated to the microstructures of the blended films informed from analyses of UV-vis spectra using the weakly interacting H-aggregate model. Photovoltaic measurements show that solar cells made with technical grade [70]PCBM have similar efficiencies to those made with higher-grade material but with decreased cost and increased mechanical robustness...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of the microstructure of poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) on its photodegradation upon exposure to UV-visible light was studied. High-regioregular (> 98 %) and low-regioregular (< 95 %) P 3 HTs with different molecular weights, dispersities and purities were submitted to irradiation under accelerated artificial ageing conditions. While the molecular weight {{had no effect on}} the photodegradation rate, a linear relationship was observed between the photodegradation rate and the regioregularity. The higher photo-instability of low-regioregular P 3 HTs, which have low crystalline phase content, could be {{due to the fact that}} the radical chain oxidation occurs predominantly in the amorphous phase of the polymer. Low-regioregular P 3 HTs also have a higher number of impurities, especially Fe residues, which are well known for their photocatalytic effect. The results also show that, at low concentrations, oxidation products are able to quench the singlet state of P 3 HT by acting as electron traps, and that the shortest wavelengths of solar light are the most harmful. Finally, the photooxidation of P 3 <b>HT</b> <b>leads</b> to the formation of low-molecular-weight carboxylic acids that can easily diffuse and migrate out of low-regioregular P 3 HT thin films. These results are therefore relevant to the preparation, storage and lifetimes of P 3 HT-based organic solar cells...|$|R

The microscopically structured P 4 VP(25) -b-PS(I) (350) brush was converted into the respectively patterned P 4 VP-PS(I) -g-P 3 HT one using KCTP. We also demonstrated that KCTP from functional block copolymers is an attractive option for nanostructuring with polymer brushes.

30|$|Today {{wireless}} {{local area}} networks (WLANs) are very popular, and {{this trend is}} growing in an ubiquitous fashion. The penetration of WLANs is recorded as almost more than 70 % in household and business enterprises and about 30 % in public sectors such as transport, leisure, events, and streets, ([URL] Meanwhile, the growing use of multimedia services with heterogeneous hardware such as iPhones, laptops, HDTV, tablets, and the dependency of enterprises on WLANs for mission-critical networks have made WLANs dynamic in topologies, complex in irregular traffic patterns, and challenging from an architectural view point. Measurements from production LANs [1] show that collisions of frames in WLANs are bound to happen, where transmission loss due to interference among 50 % of sender receiver pairs suffer a 2.5 % probability of transmission loss. While IEEE 802.11 carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) with ready to send/clear to send (RTS/CTS) has become a de-facto mechanism to avoid collisions, there exist inherent limitations as to how it treats interference at the receiver related to the carrier sensing at the transmitter. However, {{the fact is that}} successful transmissions mostly depend on an interference-free condition at the receiver. Theoretical and experimental work on CSMA/CA [2, 3] show that the CSMA/CA mechanism degrades performance due to poor spatial reuse. Besides, it also fails to address the hidden terminal (HT) problem [4] and capture effect [5] issues. Nonetheless, HT nodes (that do not sense each other’s transmission though they interfere with each other at the intended receiver causing decoding failure) are an inevitable phenomenon in WLANs and their impact on network throughput cannot be overlooked.

40|$|Background and objective. In Poland, {{the sale}} of {{antihypertensive}} drugs has significantly increased since 2000. According to that fact, the aim of our {{study was to determine}} if the increased use of antihypertensive drugs correlates with the decreasing mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including hypertension (HT). Methods. The analysis is based on data on annual national sales (million units) of four types of antihypertensive drugs in 2000 – 2010. For the same period standardized mortality rates were calculated based on the data available from the Central Statistical Office in Poland. Data analysis involved correlation analysis between annual mortality rates due CVD and HT and country-wide annual sales of antihypertensive drugs (2000 – 2010). Results. In the period 2000 – 2010, standardized mortality rates of CVD in the whole population followed a decreasing trend. Analysis of correlation of CVD with specific drug provided the following findings: diuretics (r=- 0. 97; p< 0. 0001) beta-blockers (r=- 1. 0; p< 0. 0001) renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (r=- 0. 72 p= 0. 01) calcium-channel blockers (r=- 0. 82; p= 0. 001) Standardized mortality rates for the HT showed fluctuating trend. Correlations of that mortality with global sale of these drugs were no longer negative: r= 0. 54; p= 0. 08, r= 0. 56; p= 0. 08 r= 0. 55; p= 0. 07; r= 0. 63; p= 0. 03, respectively. Conclusions. In Poland, in 2000 – 2010, an improved access to pharmacological control of HT was associated with an apparent reduction in mortality from CVD but not from HT.

40|$|Although most polymer/fullerene-based {{solar cells}} are cast from {{a blend of}} the {{components}} in solution, {{it is also possible}} to sequentially process the polymer and fullerene layers from quasi-orthogonal solvents. Sequential processing (SqP) not only produces photovoltaic devices with efficiencies comparable to the more traditional bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells produced by blend casting (BC) but also offers the advantage that the polymer and fullerene layers can be optimized separately. In this paper, we explore the morphology produced when sequentially processing polymer/fullerene solar cells and compare it to the BC morphology. We find that increasing polymer regioregularity leads to the opposite effect in SqP and BC BHJ solar cells. We start by constructing a series of SqP and BC solar cells using different types of poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) that vary in regioregulary and polydispersity combined with [6, 6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric-acid-methyl-ester (PCBM). We use grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering to demonstrate how strongly changes in the P 3 HT and PCBM crystallinity upon thermal annealing of SqP and BC BHJ films depend on polymer regioregularity. For SqP devices, low regioregularity P 3 HT films that possess more amorphous regions allow for more PCBM crystallite growth and thus show better photovoltaic device efficiency. On the other hand, highly regioregular P 3 <b>HT</b> <b>leads</b> to a more favorable morphology and better device efficiency for BC BHJ films. Comparing the photovoltaic performance and structural characterization indicates that the mechanisms controlling morphology in the active layers are fundamentally different for BHJs formed via SqP and BC. Most importantly, we find that nanoscale morphology in both SqP and BC BHJs can be systematically controlled by tuning the amorphous fraction of polymer in the active layer. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{the role}} of the low {{temperature}} seed layer in more detail is discussed, by analyzing layers grown at a range of temperatures and as function of layer thickness with a combination of analysis techniques including high resolution TEM, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The aim of the LT seed is to accommodate all of the lattice mismatch, leaving the HT layer fully relaxed. In practice there is some residual compressive strain which, as the growth temperature is increased for the <b>HT</b> layers, can <b>lead</b> to island formation at the start of these HT layers. These Ge islands can act as sources for further dislocation nucleation and promote dislocation annihilation within their restricted volume. This influences both the dislocation network during the growth and the surface morphology of the final high temperature layer. However, the continued high temperature growth leads to a smoothing effect as the mobile dislocations annihilate and a smooth surface of less than 2 nm rms, although the threading dislocations can also dissociate into stacking faults for (111) oriented growth leading to surface steps...|$|R
40|$|Electronic Design Automation (EDA) {{industry}} heavily reuses {{third party}} IP cores. These IP cores {{are vulnerable to}} insertion of Hardware Trojans (HTs) at design time by third party IP core providers or by malicious insiders in the design team. State of the art {{research has shown that}} existing HT detection techniques, which claim to detect all publicly available HT benchmarks, can still be defeated by carefully designing new sophisticated HTs. The reason being that these techniques consider the HT landscape to be limited only to the publicly known HT benchmarks, or other similar (simple) HTs. However the adversary is not limited to these HTs and may devise new HT design principles to bypass these countermeasures. In this paper, we discover certain crucial properties of <b>HTs</b> which <b>lead</b> to the definition of an exponentially large class of Deterministic Hardware Trojans $H_D$ that an adversary can (but is not limited to) design. The discovered properties serve as HT design principles, based on which we design a new HT called 'XOR-LFSR' and present it as a 'proof-of-concept' example from the class $H_D$. These design principles help us understand the tremendous ways an adversary has to design a HT, and show that the existing publicly known HT benchmarks are {{just the tip of the}} iceberg on this huge landscape. This work, therefore, stresses that instead of guaranteeing a certain (low) false negative rate for a small constant set of publicly known HTs, a rigorous HT detection tool should take into account these newly discovered HT design principles and hence guarantee the detection of an exponentially large class (exponential in number of wires in IP core) of HTs with negligible false negative rate.

40|$|This thesis {{improves}} {{our understanding}} of the charge-transfer dynamics in organic materials employed in dye-sensitized and nanotube-thiophene solar cells. For the purpose of this work, a femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy setup was built. Additionally, microsecond transient absorption spectroscopy was utilised to explore dynamics on a longer time-scale. In the first study, the dependence of dye regeneration and charge collection on the pore- filling fraction (PFF) in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is investigated. It is shown that while complete hole transfer with PFFs as low as ~ 30 % can be achieved, improvements beyond this PFF are assigned to a stepwise increase in the charge-collection efficiency in agreement with percolation theory. It is further predicted that the chargecollection efficiency saturates at a PFF of ~ 82 %. The study is followed by an investigation of three novel hole-transporting materials for DSSCs with slightly varying HOMO levels to systematically explore the possibility of reducing the loss-in-potential and thus improving the device efficiency. It is shown that despite one new HTM showing a 100 % hole-transfer yield, all devices based on the new HTMs performed worse than those incorporating spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the design of the HTM has an additional impact on the electronic density of states present at the TiO 2 electrode surface, and hence influences not only hole- but also electron-transfer from the sensitizer. Finally, a study on a polymer-single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) molecular junction is presented. Results from femtosecond spectroscopic techniques show that the polymer poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) is able to transfer charges to the SWNT within 430 fs. Addition of excess P 3 <b>HT</b> polymer <b>leads</b> to long-lived free charges making these materials a viable option for solar cells. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} organic bulk-heterojunction {{solar cells}} {{based on an}} absorber blend of poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) and [6, 6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) by electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A strong neck in the modulus plot of the EIS-spectra indicates that the absorber {{is divided into two}} regions of different conductivities. A similar behaviour was observed for pure P 3 HT-diodes. Hence, it can be concluded that the PCBM:P 3 HT absorber is p-doped by impurities of P 3 HT, so that a Schottky-like contact with aluminium is formed. It is known from literature, that annealing of PCBM:P 3 <b>HT</b> solar cells <b>leads</b> to drastic improvement of the photovoltaic performance. We compared the current-voltage characteristics and impedance spectra before and after consecutive annealing steps. After the annealing an expansion of the depletion region was observed, indicating that volatile dopants were evaporated out of the absorber. This contributes to an improved photovolta ic performance as the separation of the generated charges in the depletion region is more efficient than in the non-depleted region. Also an improved rectification behaviour might be caused by a lower doping level...|$|R
40|$|Transformation with ras oncogenes {{results in}} {{increased}} radiation sur vival in many {{but not all}} cells. In addition, prenyltransferase inhibitors which inhibit ras proteins by blocking posttranslational modification radiosensitize cells with oncogenic ras. These findings suggest that oncogenic ras contributes to intrinsic radiation resistance. However, because introduction of ras oncogenes does not increase radiation survival in all cells and because prenyltransferase inhibitors target molecules other than ras, these studies left the conclusion that ras increases the intrinsic radi ation resistance of tumor cells in doubt. Here we show that genetic inactivation of K- or N-ras oncogenes in human tumor cells (DLD- 1 and <b>HT</b> 1080, respectively) <b>leads</b> to increased radiosensitivity. Reintroduction of the activated N-ras gene into the HT 1080 line, having lost its mutant allele, resulted in increased radiation resistance. This study lends further support to the hypothesis that expression of activated ras can contribute to intrinsic radiation resistance in human tumor cells and extends this finding to the K- and N- members of the ras family. These findings support the development of strategies that target ras for inactivation {{in the treatment of}} cancer...|$|R
40|$|Samplers often {{distrust}} model-based {{approaches to}} survey inference due to concerns about model misspecification {{when applied to}} large samples from complex populations. We suggest that the model-based paradigm can work very successfully in survey settings, provided models are chosen that {{take into account the}} sample design and avoid strong parametric assumptions. The Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator is a simple design-unbiased estimator of the finite population total in probability sampling designs. From a modeling perspective, the HT estimator performs well when the ratios of the outcome values and the inclusion probabilities are exchangeable. When this assumption is not met, the HT estimator can be very inefficient. In Zheng and Little (2002 a, 2002 b) we used penalized splines (p-splines) to model smoothly -varying relationships between the outcome and the inclusion probabilities in one-stage probability proportional to size (PPS) samples. We showed that p-spline model-based estimators are in general more efficient than the HT estimator, and can be used to provide narrower confidence intervals with close to nominal confidence coverage. In this article, we extend this approach to two-stage sampling designs. We use a p-spline based mixed model that fits a nonparametric relationship between the primary sampling unit (PSU) means and a measure of PSU size, and incorporates random effects to model clustering. For variance estimation we consider the empirical Bayes model-based variance, the jackknife and balanced repeated replication. Simulation studies on simulated data and on samples drawn from public use microdata in the 1990 census demonstrate gains for the model-based p-spline estimator over the HT estimator and linear model-assisted estimators. Simulations also show the variance estimation methods yield confidence intervals with satisfactory confidence coverage. Interestingly, these gains can be seen in an equal probability design, where the first stage selection is PPS and the second stage selection probabilities are proportional to the inverse of the first stage inclusion probabilities, and the <b>HT</b> estimator <b>leads</b> to the unweighted mean. In situations that most favor the HT estimator, the model-based estimators have comparable efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Hyphenating high {{temperature}} high performance liquid chromatography (HT-HPLC) with {{high temperature}} {{size exclusion chromatography}} (HT-SEC) (high temperature two dimensional liquid chromatography (HT-HPLC x HT-SEC or <b>HT</b> 2 D-LC)) <b>leads</b> to an isocratic elution in the second dimension, which in turn enables to use IR detector (quantitative detection) for monitoring the eluting polymers. Experimental data obtained from HT 2 D-LC with IR detector are usually presented as contour plots, which can be mathematically described in matrices. Quantitative data about chemical composition, molar mass and concentration of all the segments, which are present in a polymer, can be obtained, after calibrating the HPLC separation (HPLC elution volume vs chemical composition), SEC separation (SEC separation vs molar mass) and response of the IR detector (IR response vs mass of the polymer). A new procedure based on subtraction and addition of matrices is described, which enables quantitative comparison of different polymer materials. This procedure enables to determine, which components are present in both materials (i. e., identical components or segments) and which are present only in one from both the materials (i. e., unique segments). Moreover, molar mass distribution, as well as chemical composition distribution of both identical and unique segments is evaluated from experimental data.

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado al International Symposium Cell Proliferation and Genome Integrity, celebrado en Santander (España) del 3 al 4 de abril de 2014. p 27 KIP 1 (p 27 herein after), {{member of}} the KIP/CIP family of CDK inhibitors, accumulates in the nucleus of {{quiescent}} cells provoking cell cycle arrest at the G 1 phase by inactivating Cyclin E-A/CDK 2 and Cyclin D/CDK 4 - 6 complexes. Upon mitogenic stimulation, expression of p 27 is downregulated leading to cell cycle progression. The best characterized pathway leading to p 27 downregulation involves phosphorylation at threonine 187, an event that targets p 27 for SCFSKP 2 mediated ubiquitination and degradation in proteasomes. The only kinase known so far to mediate this phosphorylation is the Cyclin E/CDK 2 complex. Myc is known to antagonize the inhibitory effect of p 27 on the cell cycle. Moreover, there is a correlation between high levels of Myc expression {{with low levels of}} p 27 in many human tumors. However, the mechanisms by which Myc decreases p 27 levels are not well understood. We have previously shown that Myc induces the expression of SKP 2 as well as the phosphorylation of p 27 at Thr 187 (Bretones et al., J Biol Chem, 2011). To explore the mechanisms involved we used the Kp 27 MER cell line, a K 562 derivative cell line carrying a ZnSO 4 -inducible p 27 construct and the chimerical MycER protein which can be activated by 4 -hydroxy-tamoxifen (4 HT). We first showed that induction of p 27 in Kp 27 MER cell line inhibited less efficiently the kinase activity of CDK 1 whereas it completely inhibited CDK 2. Activation of Myc by 4 <b>HT</b> <b>leads</b> to an increase of phospho-T 187 -p 27 and the induction of Cyclin A. Also, Myc activation increases the in vitro kinase activity of immunocomplexes containing CDK 1 and CDK 2 Interestingly, CDK 1 complexes from cells overexpressing p 27 were able to phosphorylate p 27 at T 187 in vitro upon Myc activation, but CDK 2 complexes were not. The result is consistent with the weak CDK 1 inactivation exerted by p 27 in these cells. Cyclin B/CDK 1 has been reported to phosphorylate p 27 in vitro, but the involvement of Cyclin A is unknown. As this cyclin is induced by Myc in our model, we asked for the role of Cyclin A/CDK 1 in p 27 phosphorylation. In vitro kinase assays performed with immunoprecipitated Cyclin A complexes showed the same p 27 phosphorylation pattern as the observed with CDK 1 complexes. Altogether these results suggest that Myc induction of p 27 -T 187 phosphorylation can be carried out not only by Cyclin E/CDK 2 as previously reported, but also by Cyclin A/CDK 1. This phosphorylation of p 27 is so far unreported. To confirm these results, we used three mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) derived cell lines lacking functional CDK genes: CDK 2 -/-, Cyclin E-/- and TKO (CDK 2 -/-; CDK 4 -/-; CDK 6 -/-). Overexpressing Myc-stable cell lines were generated for each cell line to study p 27 phosphorylation. CDK 1 and Cyclin A complexes from CDK 2 -/- MEFs subjected to in vitro kinase assays showed increased phospho-T 187 -p 27 when Myc was overexpressed. Similarly, CDK 1, CDK 2 and Cyclin A complexes from Cyclin E-/- MEFs also showed increased phospho-T 187 -p 27 when Myc was overexpressed. CDK 1 complexes from TKO MEFs were unable to phosphorylate p 27 in vitro while overexpression of Myc induced this phosphorylation. Purvalanol A (a CDK 1 inhibitor) abolished the p 27 phosphorylation in vitro but not CDK 9 inhibitors. Consistent with the in vitro data, extracts from CDK 2 -/- and TKO MEFs showed higher levels of phospho-T 187 -p 27 levels when Myc was activated and silencing of Myc in Myc-TKO MEFs decreased phospho-T 187 -p 27, dismissing CDK 2, CDK 4 or CDK 6 as responsible for this phosphorylation in this model. In conclusion, Myc promotes p 27 degradation by inducing its phosphorylation at the Thr 187, which is mediated not only by Cyclin E/CDK 2 complexes, but also by Cyclin A/CDK 1 complexes.
