40|$|Abstract – Feed <b>forward,</b> back <b>propagation</b> neural {{networks}} {{are known to}} be universal approximators in a certain theoretical sense. They can be time-consuming to train and require significant parameter tuning. Decision trees are generally faster and simpler to train, but are widely assumed to not offer predictive accuracy as good as feed <b>forward,</b> back <b>propagation</b> {{neural networks}}. We have noticed in previous work that decision trees tended to outperform feed <b>forward,</b> back <b>propagation</b> neural networks on a certain dataset. We provide a description of a class of problems that are extremely difficult for feed <b>forward,</b> back <b>propagation</b> neural networks but relatively simple for Decision trees. Experiments with synthetic datasets illustrate the class of problems. The importance of this result lies in making decisions about when to employ what type of classifier in practice...|$|R

50|$|Phonon-polaritons {{generated}} in ferroelectric crystals propagate nearly laterally to the excitation pulse {{due to the}} high dielectric constants of ferroelectric crystals, facilitating easy separation of phonon-polaritons from the excitation pulses that generated them. Phonon-polaritons are therefore available for direct observation, as well as coherent manipulation, as they move from the excitation region into {{other parts of the}} crystal. Lateral propagation is paramount to a polaritonic platform in which generation and propagation take place in a single crystal. A full treatment of the Cherenkov-radiation-like terahertz wave response reveals that in general, there is also a <b>forward</b> <b>propagation</b> component that must be considered in many cases.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two major}} types of {{problems}} in uncertainty quantification: one is the <b>forward</b> <b>propagation</b> of uncertainty (where the various sources of uncertainty are propagated through the model to predict the overall uncertainty in the system response) {{and the other is}} the inverse assessment of model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty (where the model parameters are calibrated simultaneously using test data). There has been a proliferation of research on the former problem and a majority of uncertainty analysis techniques were developed for it. On the other hand, the latter problem is drawing increasing attention in the engineering design community, since uncertainty quantification of a model and the subsequent predictions of the true system response(s) are of great interest in designing robust systems.|$|E
50|$|CED-12 also {{functions}} in cell migration processes, which is {{regulated by the}} same interactions as the apoptotic phagocytosis pathway. It {{functions in}} distal tip cell migration in gonad development in C. elegans. Distal tip cells are somatic cells located {{at the tip of}} developing gonadal arms, and are responsible for the elongation of the gonadal arm as well as controlling mitotic and meiotic cell division of gonadal cells throughout development and adulthood. As C. elegans develops, the distal cells undergo a series of migrations in order to complete morphological changes, which define both gonad shape and size. This process occurs when integrins {{on the surface of the}} distal tip cells meet chemoattractants located on the extracellular matrix. The integrins form focal adhesions at the sites of the chemoattractants, which causes the localization of CED-5 to the adhesion points. CED-12 and CED-2 form the GEF-trio with CED-5 and activate the CED-10 Rac-GTPase in order to rearrange the actin cytoskeleton and promote the <b>forward</b> <b>propagation</b> of the distal tip cells.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{plausible}} model for learning by back-error propagation in biological neurons. <b>Forwards</b> <b>propagation</b> occurs as action potentials propagate signals along branching axons and transmit those signals across axo-dendritic synapses, whereupon post-synaptic neurons sum their incoming signals. In our model, back-error propagation is proposed to occur via signals within intraneuronal cytoskeletal microtubules. These signals modify the effective strengths of synapses during learning. Differences between network output and desired (target) outputs are computed at synapses or by synaptic complexes. Biophysical mechanisms are suggested for the summing of errors and {{the propagation of}} errors backwards through microtubules within each neuron of the network.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that good {{correlation}} exists between large-scale, high level signal returns of bottom acoustic reverberation and bathymetric ridge structures. The ultimate goal of this type of analysis would be the removal of propagation effects resulting in a large-scale mapping of scattering strengths. Furthermore, analysis with a quasi-CW propagation model suggests a strong correlation between the small-scale fluctuations in the reverberation signal and the bottom acoustic ensonification, thereby suggesting that uncertainties in the predictions of <b>forward</b> <b>propagation</b> may limit the resolution of such mapping. By employing broadband modeling techniques, a valid representation of the complete time domain <b>forward</b> <b>propagation</b> is provided. Diffuse secondary bottom interactions appear to affect the resolution of the primary, direct-path interaction at ranges beyond a few water depths. Analysis of data recorded by near- bottom vertical line arrays (VLA's) confirms the existence of these secondary, multipath interactions in the <b>forward</b> <b>propagation.</b> The exact, two-way travel times from all bottom interactions are modeled and the influence of the secondary interactions is quantified.

The well-known Rayleigh parameter, which characterizes the degree of roughness of a corrugated surface for the case of reflection on a rough surface, is presented.

This extended Rayleigh parameter allows then to calculate the <b>forward</b> radar <b>propagation</b> over oil slicks on sea surfaces, using the Ament model.

(2) The Backtracking Problem: given the results of a <b>forward</b> <b>propagation,</b> and given a set of essential compounds that are not produced {{as a result of the}} <b>forward</b> <b>propagation,</b> what precursors must be supplied to produce those essential compounds?

The inputs to the program are a description of the metabolic network of an organism (EcoCyc), a set of nutrients corresponding to a known minimal growth medium, and a list of essential compounds to be produced. The program &quot;fires &quot; the microorganism's metabolism contained in the database and predicts all synthesized and nonsynthesized essential compounds, along with the missing precursors required to produce the latter.
