50|$|By {{increasing}} the contact {{area of the}} ball bearings on the shaft to approximately 45 degrees, the side load and direct load carrying capabilities are greatly increased. Each nut can be individually preloaded at the factory to decrease the available radial play to ensure rigidity. This process not only increases the contact area, increasing <b>direct</b> <b>loading</b> capabilities, but it also restricts any radial movement, {{increasing the}} overhung moment capabilities. This creates a sturdier structure that can handle a very strenuous working environment.|$|E
50|$|The name Iron Knob first {{appeared}} on pastoral lease maps of 1854, and the first mineral claim in the area was pegged by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company in 1897.

In 1901 a tramway from Iron Knob to Hummock Hill (later renamed Whyalla) was completed, followed by wharves in 1903.

50|$|The {{transportation}} of part-load goods that {{are susceptible to}} the weather in boxes, sacks and barrels is the main function of G class wagons.

Today the majority of part-load goods are moved in ISO containers, for which special flat wagons are available.

This was due to the immense pressure exerted on the suspension arms and the wheels by the ground effect, causing them to fail under hard braking.

50|$|The first fishing dock (later No.1 Fish Dock) was {{authorised}} in late 1854, and {{the construction}} contract awarded to Sissons at £6,996; the dock was completed early 1856. It was constructed {{to the east of}} the Royal Dock, and incorporated the flood gates of the original cofferdam at lock gates. The dock's lock was 80 by 20 ft with a depth at high spring tides of 15.5 ft. As built the dock's sides were of chalkstone covered sloped clay at with a 1 in 3 rise, at the south side a 400 ft timber wharf was built, which was rail connected by a sunken line allowing <b>direct</b> <b>loading</b> of wagons from the wharf. A timber pier was built to the east of the dock's entrance. The dock was built at a cost of £12,000, with a water area of approximately 6 acre.|$|E
50|$|The {{column of}} water in a large and deep {{artificial}} lake alters in-situ stress along an existing fault or fracture. In these reservoirs, {{the weight of the}} water column can significantly change the stress on an underlying fault or fracture by increasing the total stress through <b>direct</b> <b>loading,</b> or decreasing the effective stress through the increased pore water pressure. This significant change in stress can lead to sudden movement along the fault or fracture, resulting in an earthquake. Reservoir-induced seismic events can be relatively large compared to other forms of induced seismicity. Though understanding of reservoir-induced seismic activity is very limited, it has been noted that seismicity appears to occur on dams with heights larger than 330 ft. The extra water pressure created by large reservoirs is the most accepted explanation for the seismic activity. When the reservoirs are filled or drained, induced seismicity can occur immediately or with a small time lag.|$|E

40|$|This work proposes three {{switched}} control {{strategies for}} aggregated heating, ventilation, {{and air conditioning}} (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings to track the automatic generation control (AGC) signal in smart grid. The existing control strategies include the <b>direct</b> <b>load</b> control strategy and the setpoint regulation strategy. The <b>direct</b> <b>load</b> control strategy cannot track the AGC signal when the state of charge (SOC) of the aggregated thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) exceeds their regulation capacity, while the setpoint regulation strategy provides flexible regulation capacity, but causes larger tracking errors. To improve the tracking performance, we took {{the advantages of the}} two control modes and developed three switched control strategies. The control strategies switch between the <b>direct</b> <b>load</b> control mode and the setpoint regulation mode according to different switching indices. Specifically, we design a discrete-time controller and optimize the controller parameter for the setpoint regulation strategy using the Fibonacci optimization algorithm, enabling us to propose two switched control strategies across multiple time steps. Furthermore, we extend the switched control strategies by introducing a two-stage regulation in a single time step. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed switched control strategies can reduce the tracking errors for frequency regulation...|$|R

50|$|At {{one time}} there was a branch that spurred off from the northerly edge of the station and passed behind the {{carriage}} shed and the goods yard and on to the harbour side, terminating near the market square. This branch was used exclusively for wagons carrying ore from Foxdale Mines to ships for transport to Great Britain and Ireland and ran parallel to the road; at one time it stretched as far as the site of today's Ellan Vannin public house at {{the far corner of the}} square. The extension was positioned directly along the quayside, making it convenient for <b>direct</b> <b>loading</b> and unloading onto boats. During the 1930s it was in decline, though sections of rail remained in situ for a number of years after this. In 1988 a commemorative stamp featuring an artist's impression of a train on this extension was issued by the Isle of Man Post Office as part of a set showing old railway and tramway views of the island. A further extension to the southwest of the station also existed at Milntown and this was installed in the railway's last year of operation in 1968 in an effort to increase rail traffic. This siding ensured that limited non-passenger services continued into 1969 when trains ran to collect oil wagons for delivery to Douglas, these being the very last services on this line.|$|E
5000|$|Called [...] "UDAR" [...] for UniDirectional Auto Reverse. Used on the Nakamichi RX {{series of}} decks. With {{the advent of}} {{auto-reverse}} (playing the tape in both directions), Nakamichi had long recognized that {{the angle of the}} tape passing over the playback head was not the same if the tape head was rotated in the opposite direction and its first approach was to track the azimuth on the tape itself by moving the head slightly—a very complex affair which led to the design of the Dragon with its NAAC. Nakamichi subsequently abandoned this approach and set its engineers in search of a more elegant solution. Nakamichi soon developed its UDAR mechanism, which mimicked the way people had manually turned over their tapes in the past: a mechanical system that would eject the tape, spin it around and reload it into the deck. It was available on all Nakamichi RX series of tape decks, i.e., the RX-202, RX-303 and RX-505. The 'top of the range' RX-505 was made after the Dragon. Its operation was elegantly simple, easy to set up, easy to calibrate, and easy to use, with only one rewind and forward operation in a unique unidirectional auto-reverse deck. It also had an updated and simpler drive system that was more <b>direct</b> <b>loading,</b> had updated and quieter electronics, and its revised capstan is essentially what Nakamichi used for its 1988 Nakamichi 1000 DAT recorder.|$|E

These actions {{also have a}} positive influence on the distribution system reliability along with the increase of load rate. Thus, in order to make further research on the impact of DLC on distribution system reliability, a mathematical model of DLC on the basis of linear programming method should be set up firstly. Then, according to the change of load rate, establishing a cubic spline interpolation function represents the reliability index changing with load rate. Finally, the validity of above model and the method are studied through numerical tests on modified RBTS BUS 6 test system. As the result shows, the effectively <b>direct</b> <b>load</b> control can improve the distribution system reliability...|$|R
