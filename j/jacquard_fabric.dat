40|$|The current {{industry}} {{practice for}} producing <b>jacquard</b> <b>fabrics</b> uses computer-aided design (CAD) systems that provide visual simulations {{of the final}} color appearance of actual fabrics prior to production. This digital process is fundamentally based on the prediction of combined weave-color effects, which can be successfully achieved by accurate color mixing models and the structural details of the fabrics. With the accurate models used in CAD systems, designers would see simulations more closely resembling fabrics to be produced. By checking the previews, the designers can easily modify, that is, recolor, the designs on the display monitor without doing repetitive physical sampling with the adjustment of the weaves and the yarn colors. However, there is no ready applicable accurate color mixing model for woven structures and {{there has not been}} sufficient investigation of the color prediction despite its usefulness for the current digital CAD process. Our study investigated the, color prediction of <b>jacquard</b> woven <b>fabrics</b> designed based on the principle of optically subtractive color mixing with the use of CMY colors. The color prediction was firstly done through the application of the six color mixing models previously developed for various other applications including fiber blending and printing. The performance of each model was evaluated by calculating the difference between the predicted and the measured colorimetric data, using ΔECMC(2 : 1). The average color difference from the models was 11. 93 ΔECMC(2 : 1), which is hardly acceptable in textile industry. In order to increase the accuracy in color prediction, the six models were then optimized. As a result, substantial improvements for all models were obtained with a decrease in color difference to 4. 83 ΔECMC(2 : 1) on average after the optimizations. Among the six optimized color mixing models, the optimized Warburton-Oliver model, that is, W-O model, was found to have the lowest average ΔECMC(2 : 1) value of approximately equaling to 2, which is considered potentially useful to be applied to the current digital fabric color prediction.

40|$|International audienceFast {{and easy}} preview of a fabric {{without having to}} produce samples would be very {{profitable}} for textile designers, but remains a technological challenge. As a first step towards this objective, we study the possibility of making images of a real sample, and changing virtually the colors of its yarns while preserving the shine and shadow texture. We consider two types of fabrics: Jacquard weave fabrics made of polyester warp and weft yarns of different colors, and satin ribbons made of polyester and metallic yarns. For the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>fabric,</b> we make a color picture with a scanner on a sample in which the yarns have contrasted colors, threshold this image in order to distinguish the pixels corresponding to each yarn, and accordingly modify their hue and chroma values. This method is simple to operate but do not enable to simulate the angle-dependent shine. A second method, tested on the satin ribbon made of black polyester and achromatic metallic yarns, is based on polarized imaging. We analyze the polarization state of the reflected light which is different for dielectric and metallic materials illuminated by polarized light. We then add a fixed color value to the pixels representing the polyester yarns and modify the hue and chroma of the pixels representing the metallic yarns. This was performed for many incident angles of light, in order to render the twinkling effect displayed by these ribbons. We could verify through a few samples that the simulated previews reproduce real pictures with visually acceptable accuracy...|$|E
30|$|The fabric {{design and}} {{construction}} can also impact the flammability of soft furnishings. For <b>jacquard</b> woven <b>fabrics,</b> the design can affect the peak heat release rate (PHRR) even if the basic yarn composition within the fabric remains unchanged. For example, design patterns with large motifs may have different burning characteristics than those with small motifs ([Horrocks et al. 2001]). This is extremely important as the PHRR is often a critical performance metric for soft furnishing standards/regulations. One of the approaches to prevent heat transfer through the fabric (to the highly flammable foam core) is to use “pile” fabric structure that have raised fibers on the base fabric. Ignition of pile fibers creates what is called “surface flashing”, {{which is a very}} rapid spread of flames {{across the surface of the}} soft furnishing due to the easy ignitability and rapid consumption of these fibers. With low heat generating fibers, the flame spreads rapidly and consumes the raised fibers without igniting the base fabric. Pile or velvet fabrics are examples of such materials commonly used in residential upholstered furniture.|$|R
30|$|The {{most common}} tickings used in current {{mattresses}} are pile <b>fabrics,</b> knits, and <b>jacquard</b> woven <b>fabrics.</b> With an increased focus on allergies, physiological comfort, and fire safety, {{a variety of}} functional coatings (e.g., water-proof, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and/or FR finishes) are now applied to mattress tickings. The majority of modern ticking materials have a high polypropylene and/or polyester fiber count, with the fiber content varying significantly with the fabric structure and design pattern. These tickings are highly flammable, but are not necessarily a greater fire threat, as these synthetic fabrics tend to melt away from the ignition source and self-extinguish. Cotton tickings are often considered “sacrificial”, as they pyrolyze quickly and generate low heat, thereby resulting in little heat transfer to the inner layers of the mattress. While cotton, polyester and polypropylene fibers dominate the ticking industry, blends of luxury fibers (e.g., wool and silk) are becoming more prevalent. Wool and silk are inherently low flammability fibers. Fibers made from renewable resources (e.g., corn, soybean and bamboo) are also gaining popularity as more environmentally friendly alternatives. Viscose rayon derived from bamboo is of particularly high interest because of its inherent anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties and its good breathability and moisture absorption ([Ticking 2005]). However, very {{little is known about}} the flammability of these ‘green’ alternatives.|$|R
25|$|The {{biggest change}} to the room was in the window treatments. Jacqueline Kennedy {{specifically}} asked for new curtains for the East Room consisting of opaque silk undercurtains and yellow drapes. Boudin oversaw the design of new draperies, with silk provided by Maison Jansen. A draft design of the drapes and valances was not ready until mid-1963. Boudin, apparently wishing {{to draw attention to}} the center window between the fireplaces, designed a valance for the center window while putting all other drapes behind window boxes. For the drapes, Boudin suggested a braid border and tie-backs made of ball fringe covered in satin. Kennedy disapproved of Boudin's proposal for the valance and window boxes, as it did not make use of the historic 1902 gilt window cornices. She did, however, approve of the fabric and tie-backs. Made of a custom-manufactured gold and cream silk lampas, the fabric contained a non-repetitive design of birds, butterflies, cupids, flowers, medallions, roosters, and wheat and featured heavy fringe at the bottom. The drapes were hung in straight panels from the carved and gilded 1902 wooden cornices. The design of the valances was not finalized until April 1964. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson asked Jacqueline Kennedy to assist her in finalizing the design. Originally, they were to be of brocatelle, a <b>jacquard</b> weave <b>fabric</b> similar to brocade but thicker and heavier and with designs in high relief. But this design was countermanded by Boudin. Instead, gold lampas, trimmed with braid and hemmed with gilt, spun-metal twisted fringe at the bottom, was installed in flat panels from behind each cornice. The curtains and valances took nearly three years to design and manufacture, and were not hung in the room until the Johnson administration in 1965. The drapes and valances cost $26,149. The cost was covered by sales of Jacqueline Kennedy's guidebook to the White House, which by 1965 was in its fourth edition.|$|R
