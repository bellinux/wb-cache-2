The objective of the work presented in this paper was to study the influence of a long-term heat treatment (i. e. 1200 °C/ 2000 h) on different characteristics of atmospheric plasma sprayed TBCs. Two zirconia feedstock materials were evaluated, namely yttria partially stabilised zirconia and <b>dysprosia</b> partially stabilised zirconia.

Microstructure analyses revealed that the coating microstructure was significantly dependent on both operating conditions and heat treatment conditions.

Introduction of a second rare-earth oxide, like ytterbia or <b>dysprosia</b> led to an important increase of 'stability' towards the CO 2 -laser irradiation.

The relative density of samples with Dy 2 O 3 content of 6 and 10 mol% was over 95 % when sintered at 1050 °C under 500 MPa for holding times as short as 5 min.

30|$|There {{are some}} {{different}} ways for synthesis of <b>dysprosia</b> nanoparticles like homogenous precipitation and wet chemical methods. In this paper, combustion method for {{the preparation of}} Dy 2 O 3 nanoparticles is reported. This method is generally employed to prepare oxide materials. The process involves the exothermic reaction between an oxidizer such as metal nitrates and organic fuel, like urea (H 2 NCONH 2), carbohydrazide (CO(NHNH 2) 2), or glycine (C 2 H 5 NO 2). The combustion reaction is initiated in a muffle furnace or on a hot plate at temperatures {{of the order of}} 500  °C or less. In a typical reaction, the precursor (mixture of water, metal nitrates, and fuel) on heating decomposes, dehydrates, and ruptures into a flame. The resultant product is a voluminous, foamy powder, which occupies the entire volume of the reaction vessel [1]. The chemical energy released from the exothermic reaction between the metal nitrates and fuel can rapidly heat the system to high temperatures without an external heat source. Nanomaterials synthesized by combustion route are generally homogeneous, contain fewer impurities, and have higher surface areas than powders prepared by conventional solid-state methods. The major advantage of this method is that large-scale production can be made at relatively low temperatures. This method is very flexible and promising as it is relatively simple, reproducible, and economically feasible. By using combustion route, for preparing Dy 2 O 3, the final product is obtained in a very short time. The innovative aspect of this method is preparation of Dy 2 O 3 nanoparticles without applying calcination temperature. Although the product of the combustion method with no calcination temperature was Dy 2 O 3 nanoparticles, for further study on the effect of the heating and annealing on the structural and optical properties of <b>dysprosia,</b> three different calcination temperatures, T =  450, 550, and 650  °C were applied on the initial product (no-calcined sample). Samples structural and morphological properties are investigated via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).|$|R

40|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} (TBC’s) {{are used to}} provide both thermal insulation and oxidation protection to high temperature components within gas turbines. The development of turbines for power generation and aviation has led to designs where the operation conditions exceed the upper limits of most conventional engineering materials. As a result {{there has been a}} drive to improve thermal {{barrier coatings}} to allow the turbine to operate at higher temperatures for longer. The focus of this thesis has been to design thermal barrier coatings with lower conductivity and longer lifetime than those coatings used in industry today. The work has been divided between the development of new generation air plasma spray (APS) TBC coatings for industrial gas turbines and the development of suspension plasma spray (SPS) TBC systems. The route taken to achieve these goals with APS TBC’s has been twofold. Firstly an alternative stabiliser has been chosen for the zirconium oxide system in the form of <b>dysprosia.</b> Secondly, control of the powder morphology and spray parameters has been used to generate coating microstructures with favourable levels of porosity. In terms of development of SPS TBC systems, these coatings are relatively new with many of the critical coating parameters not yet known. The focus of the work has therefore been to characterise their lifetime and thermal properties when produced in a complete TBC system. Results demonstrate that <b>dysprosia</b> as an alternative stabiliser gives a reduction in thermal conductivity. While small at room temperature and in the as produced state; the influence becomes more pronounced at high temperatures and with longer thermal exposure time. The trade-off for this lowered thermal conductivity may be in the loss of high temperature stability. Overall, the greatest sustained influence on thermal conductivity has been from creating coatings with high levelsof porosity. In relation to lifetime, double the thermo-cyclic fatigue (TCF) life relative to the industrial standard was achieved using a coating with engineered porosity. Introducing a polymer to the spray powder helps to generate large globular pores within the coating together with a large number of delaminations. Such a structure was shown to be highly resistant to TCF testing. SPS TBC’s were shown to have much greater performance relative to their APS counterparts in thermal shock life, TCF life and thermal conductivity. Columnar SPS coatings are a prospective alternative for strain tolerant coatings in gas turbine engines...|$|R

5000|$|Early works {{considered}} {{the integration of}} luminescent materials as erosion sensors in TBCs. The notion of a [...] "thermal barrier sensor coating" [...] (sensor TBC) for temperature detection was introduced in 1998. Instead of applying a phosphor layer on the surface where the temperature needs to be measured, it was proposed to locally modify {{the composition of the}} TBC so that it acts as a thermographic phosphor as well as a protective thermal barrier. This dual functional material enables surface temperature measurement but also could provide a means to measure temperature within the TBC and at the metal/topcoat interface, hence enabling the manufacturing of an integrated heat flux gauge. First results on yttria-stabilized zirconia co-doped with europia (YSZ:Eu) powders were published in 2000. They also demonstrated sub-surface measurements looking through a 50 μm undoped YSZ layer and detecting the phosphorescence of a thin (10 µm) YSZ:Eu layer (bi-layer system) underneath using the ESAVD technique to produce the coating. The first results on electron beam physical vapour deposition of TBCs were published in 2001. The coating tested was a monolayer coating of standard YSZ co-doped with <b>dysprosia</b> (YSZ:Dy). First work on industrial atmospheric plasma sprayed (APS) sensor coating systems commenced around 2002 and was published in 2005. They demonstrated the capabilities of APS sensor coatings for in-situ two-dimensional temperature measurements in burner rigs using a high speed camera system. Further, temperature measurement capabilities of APS sensor coatings were demonstrated beyond 1400 °C. Results on multilayer sensing TBCs, enabling simultaneous temperature measurements below and {{on the surface of the}} coating, were reported. Such a multilayer coating could also be used as a heat flux gauge in order to monitor the thermal gradient and also to determine the heat flux through the thickness of the TBC under realistic service conditions.|$|R
40|$|Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) {{are used}} to reduce the actual working {{temperature}} of the high pressure turbine blade surface. Knowing the temperature across a TBC and at the interface with the thermally grown oxide (TGO) under realistic conditions is highly desirable. As the major life#controlling factors for TBC systems are linked with temperature, this would provide useful data for {{a better understanding of}} these phenomena and to assess the remnant life#time of the TBC. This would also enable the design of advanced cooling strategies in the most efficient way using a minimum amount of air. Further the integration of a sensor coating into an on#line temperature detection system will enable the full potential of TBCs to be realised due to improved precision in temperature measurement and early warning of degradation. This in turn will increase fuel efficiency and reduce CO 2 emissions. The concept of sensing TBCs was patented by Choy et al. [114] in 1998 and consists of locally modifying the composition of the TBC so that it acts as a thermographic phosphor. As a result, the temperature dependence of the lifetime of the laser induced phosphorescence process can be used for temperature measurements. The purpose of this work was to develop a multilayer sensing TBC deposited by electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB#PVD) which could be used to remotely measure the temperature at different depths in the coating. In this study, the reader is introduced to the theory of luminescence sensing and its TBC application. Several yttria partially stabilised zirconia TBCs, co#doped with rare earth oxides (YSZ:RE) phosphors, were studied and it was shown that <b>dysprosia</b> doped YSZ has the highest temperature sensitivity. The influence of dopant concentration, layering and high temperature aging on the phosphorescence process were also researched. During the project, a novel, non#destructive, method to monitor the high temperature degradation of the TBC using phosphorescence measurements was found. Alternative phosphor compositions, based on yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) material, were successfully deposited by EB#PVD and it was shown that doped YAG TBC compositions could further improve the maximum temperature measurement capability of current sensing TBCs. A multilayer EB#PVD coating comprising of two different phosphor layers was deposited and tested in order to demonstrate that such systems could be used to remotely measure the temperature at two different depths in the TBC simultaneously and therefore to monitor the thermal gradient in the coating, permitting the direct measurement of heat flux under thermal gradient conditions, for example in service...|$|R
