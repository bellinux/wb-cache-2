5|$|Bede relates that Paulinus told Edwin {{that the}} birth of his and Æthelburg's {{daughter}} at Easter 626 was because of Paulinus' prayers. The birth coincided with a foiled assassination attempt on the king by a group of West Saxons from Wessex. Edwin promised to convert to Christianity and allow his new daughter Eanflæd to be baptised if he won a victory over Wessex. He did not fulfill his promise immediately after his subsequent military success against the West Saxons however, only converting after Paulinus had revealed the details of a dream the king had before he took the throne, during his exile at the court of King Rædwald of East Anglia. In this dream, according to Bede, a stranger told Edwin that power would be his in the future when someone laid a hand on his head. As Paulinus was revealing the dream to Edwin, <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>his</b> hand on the king's head, which was the proof Edwin needed. A late seventh-century hagiography of Pope Gregory I claims that Paulinus was the stranger in the vision; if true, it might suggest that Paulinus spent some time at Rædwald's court, although Bede does not mention any such visit.|$|E
500|$|Zappa {{later found}} out that when the {{material}} was recorded, Wilson had taken LSD. [...] "I've {{tried to imagine what}} [...] must have been thinking", Zappa recounted, [...] "sitting in that control room, listening to all that weird shit coming out of the speakers, and being responsible for telling the engineer, Ami Hadani (who was not on acid), what to do." [...] By the time Freak Out! was edited and shaped into an album, Wilson had spent $25–35,000 of MGM's money. In Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that [...] "Wilson was sticking his neck out. <b>He</b> <b>laid</b> <b>his</b> job on the line by producing the album. MGM felt that they had spent too much money on the album." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the account}} in , he was blinded {{for three days}} and had to be led into Damascus by the hand. During these three days, Saul took no food or water and spent his time in prayer to God. When Ananias of Damascus arrived, <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>his</b> hands on him and said: [...] "Brother Saul, the Lord, [...] Jesus, that {{appeared}} unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost." [...] His sight was restored, he got up and was baptized. This story occurs only in Acts, not in the Pauline epistles.|$|E
2500|$|In the summer, {{during the}} Council {{debate over the}} {{appointment}} of the next military commander for Ireland, Essex {{turned his back on}} the Queen, and she lost her temper, striking him across the head. <b>He</b> <b>laid</b> <b>his</b> hand on the hilt of his sword, but was held back by the Lord Admiral. Before leaving the chamber Essex (again, according to Camden) said, [...] "he neither could nor would put up so great an affront and indignity, neither would he have taken it at King Henry the Eighth his hands". Tradition has it that he also called the Queen, [...] "as crooked in her disposition as in her carcass".|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecutor}} provided embarrassing {{details of}} the crime to the jury. He described how Hitchen and Williamson moved from Royal Oak in the Strand to Rummer Tavern {{and came to the}} Talbot Inn, where the under-marshal ordered a bedroom. Along the way in each bar Hitchen offered either beer or wine and showed disgraceful manners. Williamson said he wanted to leave the marshal but was not allowed to, being forced to leave his hat with him and receiving a little money in return. According to Williamson's testimony he was persuaded to follow the marshal into the room, where he [...] "did all that a beastly appetite could prompt him to". Williamson reported going to his relative, Joseph Cockrost, who took him back to the tavern and asked to be informed as soon as the prisoner appeared, which happened the following Saturday. In his testimony Cockrost mentioned knocking at the door after seeing [...] "filthy actions" [...] through the keyhole. When opening the door he took the marshal by the collar and threatened him, saying, [...] "I'll whip you through the Gills" [...] when <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>his</b> hand on the sword. Testimonies were given by a servant of the tavern proving to have seen the same scene with the prosecutor, a constable, John Carter, watchmen and some character witnesses. Interestingly, the constable opposed the watchmen, who were probably trying to accuse Williamson of inventing the story. At last, the prisoner was acquitted of actual sodomy and found guilty on the second charge, assault. For [...] "sodomitical practices" [...] Hitchen was fined [...] £20 and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment and standing in the pillory near the end of Catherine Street, in the Strand.|$|E

2500|$|The first Australian wicket fell {{before a}} run {{was on the}} board {{for the third time}} in the series, but it was Ken Archer who succumbed to Alec Bedser when he glanced the third ball of the day to Denis Compton at short fine-leg, though he hung about the wicket even after he was given out by Umpire Barlow. Having livened up the crowd the bowlers had a tough day as the Adelaide Oval was up to its usual standards. Arthur Morris batted a very careful and {{composed}} innings, the highest of his Test career as <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>his</b> reputation as [...] "Bedser's Bunny" [...] to rest. He made 206 out of Australia's 371 before he was the last man out, spending 7 hours and 42minutes at the crease and striking 23 boundaries in the process. He passed 2,000 runs in Tests and made his seventh Ashes century in four years, overtaking Victor Trumper and Bill Woodfull placing him behind only Sir Donald Bradman on the list of Australian century-makers against England. No other Australian batsman made 50, but he added 95 runs for the second wicket with Lindsay Hassett (43), 110 for the third wicket with Neil Harvey (44) and 76 for the fourth wicket with Keith Miller (44). Thereafter wickets fell sharply, the last five falling for 14 runs, and the innings ended when he was bowled by Roy Tattersall (3/95). The young Lancashire off-spinner had an impressive debut which justified his selection even though he had to borrow E.W. Swanton's boots because his feet had swollen on the flight. He began by conceding only 5 runs from his first 6 overs and spun the ball so much that it floated across the wicket before turning on the unhelpful wicket. He dismissed fellow debutant Jim Burke with a ball that he bowled at the leg stump so that Burke went down on one knee to sweep it, but it floated over the wicket and knocked over the off-stump. He also bowled Don Tallon, getting his three wickets without any help from the fielders. Alec Bedser returned figures of 3/74, but Hassett protected Morris early in his innings and Miller hit his first over of the second day for 15. Doug Wright took 4/99 and only Morris, a noted player of spinners, was able to master him, but John Warr (0/63) could still not take a wicket.|$|E
