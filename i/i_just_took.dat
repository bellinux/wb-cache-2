500|$|The {{wedding dress}} was a Vera Wang {{original}} dress from {{a while ago}} that I actually wore on a certain occasion and had it in storage and when {{we came up with}} the concept for the video that had the element of a wedding in it, I said, ‘well, I do have my old wedding dress,’. 'It’s still worth [...] for me ’cause I can’t believe I was ever married but whatever, end of story. And I knew that we wouldn’t {{be able to get a}} fabulous dress like in two days so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> that dress out of the storage – it has a 27-foot train and it was just all hand-beaded and stuff and so I figured we might as well get a use out of it.' ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{also helped}} the Red Hot Chili Peppers earn a {{dedicated}} cult fanbase in Los Angeles. [...] One of these fans was John Frusciante, {{who would later}} join the band as guitarist after Slovak's death. [...] Frusciante recalled: [...] "The first time I saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers live was at the Variety Arts Center, {{and that was really}} amazing ... They were going for this real hard sound. [...] Hillel was doing all this awesome feedback and stuff. [...] It was the most magical experience I ever had in the experience of a show." [...] Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovak's work, and explained, [...] "I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel's playing and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> it sideways from there." ...|$|E
500|$|The band wasn't {{without a}} guitarist for very long. In October 1988, Kiedis and Flea found a {{replacement}} for McKnight in teenage guitarist, John Frusciante. Flea had originally directed Frusciante to audition for the band Thelonious Monster. An avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, Frusciante was, according to Flea, [...] "a really talented and knowledgeable musician. He [...] knows all the shit I don't know. I basically know nothing about music theory and he's studied it to death, inside and out. He's a very disciplined musician—all he cares about are his guitar and his cigarettes." [...] Frusciante was also not very familiar with the funk genre: [...] "I wasn't really a funk player before I joined the band. I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel [...] playing and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> it sideways from there." ...|$|E
5000|$|Miller {{was also}} quite {{stressed}} on the court.

500|$|The {{story of}} [...] "In the Presence of Enemies" [...] was {{inspired}} by a Korean manhwa named Priest, as Petrucci explains that not being a manga fan, precisely, [...] " [...] I like it though. This one, I just stumbled upon and I really liked the content. It inspired me to take a different approach lyrically. You have to keep things interesting for yourself when writing new material so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> this and ran with it. [...] Those types of lyrics are fun to write, you know? The dark subject matter, the dark master stuff. It's another way of writing, a fresh one to me." [...] He also summarizes the lyrics: [...] "It's a story about somebody who loses himself and end struggles with the darkness, symbolized by the Dark Master. And the story ends up really being the darkness within and goes through the different phases where he has to fight demons and things like that.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Comic Book Resources, Wolfman stated that Santa Monica suggested the use of two time periods, with past events affecting the narrative in the present. He introduced new characters, including Kratos' wife—who appeared in the games but was never named. He stated the final script {{was a combination of}} his ideas and Santa Monica's character-appropriate dialog. Series artist Andrea Sorrentino stated, [...] "it was clear from the start that for this project Sony and DC [...] wanted something a bit different from a 'classical' comic. So <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> my usual style and added to it something new, like new colors from the videogame palette." [...] She stated that the games have strong, epic images, and that she easily adapted her style to Wolfman's writing as he [...] "did really good work showing both dramatic and epic scenes." [...] Sorrentino used color to give importance to each scene, adding hot colors (red, orange, or brown) in action scenes and cold ones (green or light blue) in others so that readers could immediately have an emotional reaction.|$|E
500|$|However, Frusciante was not {{familiar}} with the funk genre of Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound: [...] "I wasn't really a funk player before I joined the band. I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel [...] playing and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> it sideways from there." [...] Several weeks into the band's new lineup, Peligro, whose performance was suffering due to extreme drug abuse, was fired. Soon after, Chad Smith was added as the group's new drummer and the new lineup began recording their first album, 1989's Mother's Milk. Frusciante focused on emulating Slovak's signature style, rather than imposing his own personal style on the group. Producer Michael Beinhorn disagreed, and wanted Frusciante to play with an uncharacteristic heavy metal tone, largely absent from the band's three preceding records. Frusciante and Beinhorn fought frequently over guitar tone and layering, and Beinhorn's idea ultimately prevailed as Frusciante felt pressured by the producer's much greater knowledge of the studio. Kiedis recalls that [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." ...|$|E

[...] He added to Katie Couric that his jumpy condition, as he spoke to her, {{reflected}} [...] "a dearth of medication — not by design. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> it, and it kicks in when it kicks in." [...] He further laughed, [...] "That's funny — the notion that you could calculate it for effect." ...|$|R

"Do it?--nothing simpler! <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> my Seven-league Boots, {{run over}} to Rome, pick up Prince Charles, {{put him on the}} magic carpet, fly to London, clap the Cap of Darkness on him so that nobody can see him, set him down on the throne of his fathers; pick up the Elector, carry him over to his beloved Hanover, and the trick is done--what they call a bloodless {{revolution}} in the history books." ...|$|R
500|$|After {{the success}} of Dallas, Jacobs' {{presented}} his initial idea again and created Knots Landing, with some alterations of his original script. In an interview, Jacobs explained: [...] " [...] Well, that's pretty good, but you know-and then {{he pulled out the}} pages that we'd left for them a few years ago on Knots Landing, or a year before on Knots, and he said, 'Is there any way we can make this a spin-off?' [...] <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> one of the couples and made it, you know, Val and Gary who had already been created on the parent series and putting them into the mix, but when you have four couples and you change one, you sort of have to change the dynamic all the way around. However, once I wrote the script, remarkably little changed from the script and the pilot as you would see it." [...] Gary Ewing was originally played by actor David Ackroyd, but Ackroyd was unable to sign on for the spin-off, and Ted Shackelford assumed the role. Initially, it was presumed that Charlene Tilton would be joining Knots Landing as Gary and Val's daughter, but the network decided to keep her on Dallas {{in order to keep the}} two shows separate. She did, however, make a guest appearance in the first season.|$|E
500|$|Slovak's {{work was}} one of the major {{contributing}} factors to the Red Hot Chili Peppers' early sound. When Kiedis and Flea were searching for a new guitarist to replace Slovak, Kiedis likened the experience to [...] "shopping for a new Mom and Dad" [...] because of his influence over the band. [...] Flea, who originally listened exclusively to jazz, added that Slovak introduced him to a new genre of music, saying that [...] "it was Hillel who first got me into hard rockin. He was also a huge influence on a young John Frusciante, who would later replace him as guitarist in the band. Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovak's work, and explained, [...] "I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel's playing and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> it sideways from there." [...] Just like Slovak before him, Frusciante developed a heroin addiction. Unlike Slovak, Frusciante eventually managed to break and defeat the habit. The songs [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] (from Mother's Milk), [...] "My Lovely Man" [...] (from Blood Sugar Sex Magik), [...] "This is the Place" [...] (from By the Way), and [...] "Feasting on the Flowers" [...] (from The Getaway) were written about or as tributes to Slovak. The band's 1987 cover version of Jimi Hendrix's song [...] "Fire", recorded with Slovak and previously only released on the [...] "Fight Like a Brave" [...] single and The Abbey Road EP, was included on 1989's Mother's Milk along with and image of one of Slovak's paintings inside the album's booklet. In 1999, a book titled Behind the Sun: The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak was published. The book was authored by Slovak's brother, James Slovak, and features writings from his brother's diaries, paintings, photos and hand-written notes from Kiedis and Flea.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} some {{historical}} controversy over whether Albert Einstein {{was aware of the}} Michelson–Morley results when he developed his theory of special relativity, which pronounced the aether to be [...] "superfluous." [...] In a later interview, Einstein said of the Michelson–Morley experiment, [...] "I was not conscious it had influenced me directly... I guess <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> it for granted that it was true." [...] Regardless of Einstein's specific knowledge, the experiment is today considered the canonical experiment in regards to showing the lack of a detectable aether.|$|E

5000|$|The {{accusations of}} Mencia's {{plagiarism}} were referenced in [...] "Fishsticks," [...] the April 8, 2009 {{episode of the}} animated TV series South Park, in which Mencia takes credit for a joke that Jimmy Valmer writes in the episode. When {{faced with the prospect}} of being assaulted, he admits, [...] "I took credit for it because I'm not actually funny!... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> jokes and repackage them with a Mexican accent!" [...] The character is then killed by Kanye West.|$|R
2500|$|In a 1995 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Jagger said, [...] "I {{think that was}} taken from an old idea of Baudelaire's, I think, but I could be wrong. Sometimes when I look at my Baudelaire books, I can't see it in there. But it was an idea I got from French writing. And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> a couple of lines and expanded on it.

2500|$|The {{brothers}} toured with Buddy Holly in 1957 and 1958. According to Holly's biographer Philip Norman, {{they were}} responsible for persuading Holly and the Crickets to change their outfits from Levi's and T-shirts to the Everlys' Ivy League suits. Don said Holly wrote and composed [...] "Wishing" [...] for them. [...] "We were all from the South," [...] Phil observed of their commonalities. [...] "We'd started in country music." [...] Although some sources say Phil Everly was one of Holly's pallbearers in February 1959, Phil said in 1986 that he attended the funeral and sat with Holly's family, but was not a pallbearer. Don did not attend, saying, [...] "I couldn't go to the funeral. I couldn't go anywhere. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> to my bed." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1976 Ginn {{formed the}} punk rock band Panic. Panic {{recorded}} eight songs in January 1978, but no labels {{were interested in}} releasing the music aside from Los Angeles, California record label Bomp! Records. By late 1978 Bomp had still not formally agreed to release the music on record, so Ginn decided he had enough business experience with SST to release it himself. Pressing records {{turned out to be}} a simple matter; [...] "I just looked in the phone book under record pressing plants and there was one there", Ginn recalled, [...] "and so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> it to them and I knew about printing because I had always done catalogs." [...] SST Records released the music recorded by Ginn's band (now named Black Flag) as the Nervous Breakdown EP in January 1979.|$|E

In a November 2015 interview Noodles said that he hoped the album would be released in 2016. However, in an August 2016 interview with EMP LIVE TV, Noodles said they had five or six songs done and they would release one or two songs soon. In the same interview, Noodles hoped the album would be finished by the end of 2016. In an October 2016 interview with Alaska Dispatch News, Noodles stated that the band was [...] "planning on getting in the studio soon" [...] to record the album, planned for release in 2017.
