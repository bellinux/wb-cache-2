5|$|Harveys Lake {{has been}} the subject of {{scientific}} studies since the late 1940s, when C. B. Reif conducted limnological studies on it. By the 1960s, Harveys Lake began to develop environmental problems. It was the subject of a number of studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These studies indicated that the lake was <b>eutrophic.</b> Algae blooms caused it to be closed to swimming in 1981 and 1990. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection completed a phosphorus TMDL for the lake in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The lake is {{surrounded}} with fringing reedbeds, carr woodland and grassland, which are managed by Bristol Water. The water conditions are <b>eutrophic</b> with run off from local fields and streams. Open-water plant communities are rather sparse, largely comprising fennel pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus), lesser pondweed (Potamogeton pusillus), opposite-leaved pondweed (Groenlandia densa) and water-crowfoot (Ranunculus spp.). On neutral soils around the reservoir, pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus), burnet-saxifrage (Pimpinella saxifraga) and devil's-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis) occur, and on calcareous soils fairy flax (Linum catharticum), dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule) and salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor subspecies minor) are found.|$|E
5|$|Native Silver perch and {{introduced}} brown trout were released in 1981–83 and 1987–89 respectively, {{but have not}} been stocked since. Silver perch stockings resulted in almost no captures. Introduced rainbow trout have been released sporadically, approximately once a decade, but have not been released since 2002–04, due to unacceptably low survival rates. According to a government report, {{the reason for the}} low survival rate is unknown, but the dominance of carp in the competition for food is one suggested theory. However, the <b>eutrophic</b> nature and high water temperatures of the lake in summer are more probable reasons. Golden perch and Murray cod have accounted for around four fifths of the released fish in the last three decades and have been the only fish stocked in the last five years. The government plans to stock only these two species for the five years leading up to 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecosystem}} of Dal is ecologically rich in macrophytes, submerged macrophytes, floating macrophytes and phytoplankton. Macrophyte flora {{recorded in}} the lake's aquatic and marshland environment consists of 117 species, belonging to 69 genera and 42 families. The lake is noted in particular for its Nelumbo nucifera (lotus flowers) which bloom in July and August. The prolific growth of Ceratophyllum demersum in the <b>eutrophic</b> zones has been reported, with Myriophyllum spicatum and Potemogetton lucens cited as dominant species. Other macrophytes discerned in different zones of the lake include Typho angustata, Phragmites australis, Myriophyllum, Sparganium evectum and Myriophyllum verticillatum, which contribute {{to the production of}} macrophites. The rooted variety of the floating leaf type consists of Neelambium nucifera, Nymphaea alba, N.Tertagonia, N.Candida, Nymphoides peltatum, Salvinia natans, Hydrocharis dubia, Nymphaea sp. and Potamogeton natans, all of which occupy 29.2% of the lake. Phytoplanktons include Navicula radiosa, Nitzschia accicularis, Fragilaria crotonensis, Diatoma elongatum, Scenedesmus bijuga, Pediastrum duplex, Tetraedron minimum, Microcystis aeruginosa and Merismopedia elegans.|$|E
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation {{of the lake}} by water hyacinth, has substantially impeded water circulation and caused an increase in siltation and deposit of pollutants in the lake ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a <b>eutrophic</b> condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E

However, in Britain at least, P. praelongus is now predominantly found in oligotrophic to mesotrophic waters.|$|E
25|$|Enhanced {{growth of}} aquatic {{vegetation}} or phytoplankton and algal blooms disrupts normal {{functioning of the}} ecosystem, causing a variety of problems such {{as a lack of}} oxygen needed for fish and shellfish to survive. The water becomes cloudy, typically coloured a shade of green, yellow, brown, or red. Eutrophication also decreases the value of rivers, lakes and aesthetic enjoyment. Health problems can occur where <b>eutrophic</b> conditions interfere with drinking water treatment.|$|E
25|$|Eutrophication is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in coastal waters. In contrast to freshwater systems, nitrogen is more commonly the key limiting nutrient of marine waters; thus, nitrogen levels have greater importance to understanding eutrophication problems in salt water. Estuaries tend to be naturally <b>eutrophic</b> because land-derived nutrients are concentrated where run-off enters a confined channel. Upwelling in coastal systems also promotes increased productivity by conveying deep, nutrient-rich waters to the surface, where the nutrients can be assimilated by algae.|$|E
25|$|As {{organic matter}} decays under low-oxygen (or hypoxic) {{conditions}} (such as in swamps, <b>eutrophic</b> lakes or dead zones of oceans), sulfate-reducing bacteria {{will use the}} sulfates present in the water to oxidize the organic matter, producing hydrogen sulfide as waste. Some of the hydrogen sulfide will react with metal ions in the water to produce metal sulfides, which are not water-soluble. These metal sulfides, such as ferrous sulfide FeS, are often black or brown, leading to the dark color of sludge.|$|E
25|$|Estuaries {{tend to be}} {{naturally}} <b>eutrophic</b> because land-derived nutrients {{are concentrated}} where runoff enters the marine environment in a confined channel. The World Resources Institute has identified 375 hypoxic coastal zones around the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly in Japan. In the ocean, there are frequent red tide algae blooms that kill fish and marine mammals and cause respiratory problems in humans and some domestic animals when the blooms reach close to shore.|$|E
25|$|Eutrophication {{may cause}} {{competitive}} release by making abundant a normally limiting nutrient. This process causes {{shifts in the}} species composition of ecosystems. For instance, an increase in nitrogen might allow new, competitive species to invade and out-compete original inhabitant species. This {{has been shown to}} occur in New England salt marshes. In Europe and Asia, the common carp frequently lives in naturally <b>Eutrophic</b> or Hypereutrophic areas, and is adapted to living in such conditions. The eutrophication of areas outside its natural range partially explain the fish's success in colonising these areas after being introduced.|$|E
25|$|Bacteria are {{the chief}} agents of {{transformation}} of DOM and POM into bioavailable carbon through the microbial loop. This mechanism {{is particularly important}} in nutrient limited marine systems, where bacteria release nutrients from sinking detritus, allowing it to be recycled back to the photic zone. Little work {{has been applied to}} the function of the microbial loop in the San Francisco Estuary, but {{it may be that the}} role of bacteria is not critical for recycling nutrients in a <b>eutrophic</b> system. Rather, they may provide an alternative food chain through direct grazing by flagellates, rotifers and ciliates.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to human}} development, Flushing Meadows was {{originally}} a tidal marsh, with Flushing Creek receiving south-flowing waters from the tides of Flushing Bay. Although the lakes were built as freshwater lakes and dammed to mitigate tidal effects, flooding continues {{to effect the}} park. The lakes are also highly <b>eutrophic,</b> due to nutrients such as phosphorus from the former marshland seeping into the water, leading {{to the death of}} fish in the lakes. The regular tidal action that would filter the lakes is prevented by the dam. In addition, the lakes are subject to pollution and storm runoff from the nearby highways, via pipes which feed into the lakes.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen is {{required}} by all aerobically respiring plants and animals and it is replenished in daylight by photosynthesizing plants and algae. Under <b>eutrophic</b> conditions, dissolved oxygen greatly increases during the day, but is greatly reduced after dark by the respiring algae and by microorganisms that feed on the increasing mass of dead algae. When dissolved oxygen levels decline to hypoxic levels, fish and other marine animals suffocate. As a result, creatures such as fish, shrimp, and especially immobile bottom dwellers die off. In extreme cases, anaerobic conditions ensue, promoting growth of bacteria such as Clostridium botulinum that produces toxins deadly to birds and mammals. Zones where this occurs are known as dead zones.|$|E
25|$|Lakes can be also {{categorized}} on {{the basis}} of their richness in nutrients, which typically affect plant growth. Nutrient-poor lakes are said to be oligotrophic and are generally clear, having a low concentration of plant life. Mesotrophic lakes have good clarity and an average level of nutrients. <b>Eutrophic</b> lakes are enriched with nutrients, resulting in good plant growth and possible algal blooms. Hypertrophic lakes are bodies of water that have been excessively enriched with nutrients. These lakes typically have poor clarity and are subject to devastating algal blooms. Lakes typically reach this condition due to human activities, such as heavy use of fertilizers in the lake catchment area. Such lakes are of little use to humans and have a poor ecosystem due to decreased dissolved oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{clarifier}} effluent {{was discharged}} directly to <b>eutrophic</b> natural wetlands for decades before environmental regulations discouraged the practice. Where adequate land is available, stabilization ponds with constructed wetland ecosystems {{can be built}} to perform secondary treatment separated from the natural wetlands receiving secondary treated sewage. Constructed wetlands resemble fixed-film systems more than suspended growth systems, because natural mixing is minimal. Constructed wetland design uses plug flow assumptions to compute the residence time required for treatment. Patterns of vegetation growth and solids deposition in wetland ecosystems, however, can create preferential flow pathways which may reduce average residence time. Measurement of wetland treatment efficiency is complicated because most traditional water quality measurements cannot differentiate between sewage pollutants and biological productivity of the wetland. Demonstration of treatment efficiency may require more expensive analyses.|$|E
500|$|The {{water in}} Hart Lake is quite murky due to {{suspended}} particles stirred {{up from the}} shallow bottom by wave action. [...] However, water clarity {{is not a good}} indicator of the lake's trophic state. [...] The amount of nutrients in the lake is very high; nitrate and phosphorus levels indicate a hypereutrophic condition. [...] This is counterbalanced by the chlorophyll level and related phytoplankton growth, which are typical of a mesotrophic lake. [...] This [...] is due to the reduced light level in the lake's cloudy waters, so overall, the lake is classified as <b>eutrophic,</b> with very high turbidity.|$|E
500|$|Dragonflies {{as a group}} {{occupy a}} {{considerable}} variety of habitats, but many species, and some families, have their own specific environmental requirements. Some species prefer flowing waters, while others prefer standing water. For example, the Gomphidae (clubtails) live in running water, and the Libellulidae (skimmers) live in still water. Some species are found in temporary water pools and are capable of tolerating changes in water level, desiccation, and the resulting variations in temperature, but some genera such as Sympetrum (darters) [...] have eggs and larvae that can resist drought and are stimulated to grow rapidly in warm, shallow pools, also often benefiting from the absence of predators there. Vegetation and its characteristics including submerged, floating, emergent, or waterside are also important. Adults may require emergent or waterside plants to use as perches; others may need specific submerged or floating plants on which to lay eggs. Requirements may be highly specific, as in Aeshna viridis (green hawker), which lives in swamps with the water-soldier, Stratiotes aloides. The chemistry of the water, including its trophic status (degree of enrichment with nutrients) and pH can also affect its use by dragonflies. Most species need moderate conditions, not too <b>eutrophic,</b> not too acid; a few species such as Sympetrum danae (black darter) and Libellula quadrimaculata (four-spotted chaser) prefer acidic waters such as peat bogs, while others such as Libellula fulva (scarce chaser) need slow-moving, <b>eutrophic</b> waters with reeds or similar waterside plants.|$|E
500|$|Free oxygen also {{occurs in}} {{solution}} in the world's water bodies. The increased solubility of [...] at lower temperatures (see Physical properties) {{has important implications}} for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content. Water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce the [...] content in <b>eutrophic</b> water bodies. Scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water's biochemical oxygen demand, or the amount of [...] needed to restore it to a normal concentration.|$|E
