5|$|Spirited Away {{contains}} critical {{commentary on}} modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues. Chihiro <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a representation of}} the shōjo, whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post-war Japan.|$|E
5|$|Although the Act {{was largely}} ineffective, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{the first piece}} of Health & Safety legislation, leading the way to {{subsequent}} regulations covering industrial workplaces; its requirement for factory walls to be whitewashed continued to be a legal requirement until the Factories Act 1961.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} Ronaldinho in 2003, and Barcelona's {{subsequent}} success in La Liga and Champions League, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> crucial {{to an increase}} in the national, and worldwide, fan-base of the club. This development of a larger national fan-base has created friction between the Catalan nationalist supporters, who wish to secede from Spain, and the club's other Spanish supporters.|$|E

5|$|A WiiWare launch {{title in}} all regions, it was {{released}} on March 25, 2008 in Japan, May 12, 2008 in North America, and May 20, 2008 in Europe. The game costs 1500 Wii Points. Reviews of the game were generally favorable, and it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the most}} innovative games released on the WiiWare service. A followup, , was announced at a Nintendo keynote speech at the Game Developers Conference 2009, and was a tower defense game that was also met with positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|An {{alcoholic}} and womanizer, Kunichika also portrayed women deemed beautiful (bijinga), contemporary social life, {{and a few}} landscapes and historical scenes. He worked successfully in the Edo period, and carried those traditions into the Meiji period. To his contemporaries and now to some modern art historians, this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a significant achievement during a transitional period of great social and political change in Japan's history.|$|E
5|$|Branch's music {{regularly}} expresses {{religious and}} political themes emphasizing American exceptionalism. Her music has been well received among conservative commentators {{and members of the}} Tea Party movement for its political message. The use of Branch's music in the campaigns of Cain and Santorum <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an indication of its appeal among outsider candidates. She has released nine singles and an EP, and is working on her debut album for release in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Malawi <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a {{haven for}} {{refugees}} from other African countries, including Mozambique and Rwanda, since 1985. These influxes of refugees have placed a strain on the Malawian economy but have also drawn significant inflows of aid from other countries. Donors to Malawi include the United States, Canada, Germany, Iceland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Ireland, the UK and Flanders (Belgium), as well as international {{institutions such as the}} World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, the African Development Bank and UN organisations.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} nineteenth century the rhyme <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the most popular}} and well known in the English-speaking world. It has also been {{referenced}} in both literature and popular culture. It was used by T. S. Eliot at the climax of his poem The Waste Land (1922). The final line of the verse was probably the inspiration for the title of Lerner and Loewe's 1956 musical My Fair Lady. The tune is often used by English football supporters as the basis for chants.|$|E
5|$|The British Army {{maintains}} a standing liability {{to support the}} civil authorities in certain circumstances, usually in either niche capabilities (e.g. explosive ordance removal) or in general support of the civil authorities when their capacity is exceeded. In recent years this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> Army personnel supporting the civil authorities {{in the face of}} the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak, the 2002 Firefighters strike, widespread flooding in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2013 and 2014 and most recently supporting the security services on Operation Temperer following the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle at}} Catraeth <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{an attempt to}} resist the advance of the Angles, who had {{probably}} by then occupied the former Votadini lands of Bryneich in modern north-eastern England and made it their kingdom of Bernicia. At some time after the battle, the Angles absorbed the Gododdin kingdom, possibly {{after the fall of}} their capital Din Eidyn in 638, and incorporated it into the kingdom of Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|The third letter openly {{incorporates}} Swift's {{argument that}} political authority {{stems from the}} consent of a population. As such, the third letter <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a response {{in part to the}} Declaratory Act, which had undermined the independence and the authority of Irish legislature and judiciary in favour of the British. The Declaratory Act removed the ability for any in Ireland to speak for the people of Ireland, and it was necessary for the act to be removed before the people could be heard.|$|E
5|$|White's Natural History {{was at once}} well {{received}} by contemporary critics and the public, and continued to be admired by a diverse range of nineteenth and twentieth century literary figures including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas Carlyle, Charles Darwin, John Ruskin, Virginia Woolf, and W. H. Auden. His work <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an early contribution to ecology and in particular to phenology. The book has been enjoyed for its charm and apparent simplicity, {{and the way that}} it creates a vision of pre-industrial England.|$|E

5|$|Aborigines were {{represented}} by eight members out of 225 {{seats in the}} Legislative Yuan. In 2008, the number of legislative seats was cut in half to 113, of which Taiwanese aborigines are represented by six members, three each for lowland and highland peoples. The tendency of Taiwanese aborigines to vote {{for members of the}} pan-blue coalition has been cited as having the potential to change the balance of the legislature. Citing these six seats in addition with five seats from smaller counties that also tend to vote pan-blue <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> giving the pan-blue coalition 11 seats before the first vote is counted.|$|E
5|$|Allan Ramsay {{studied in}} Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he {{established}} himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility and he undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, including his friend the philosopher David Hume and the visiting Jean-Jacques Rousseau. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was Principal Painter in Ordinary to George III. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors. His work <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> anticipating the grand manner of Joshua Reynolds, but many of his early portraits, particularly of women, are less formal and more intimate studies.|$|E
5|$|As a character, Spencer <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an everyman figure, his blank {{expression}} and plain dress keeping him a simple archetype. Spencer displays a pacifistic and fatalistic inactivity throughout the film, simply allowing events to unfold around him without taking control. This passive behavior culminates in his sole act of instigation at the film's climax; his apparent act of infanticide {{is driven by}} his life of being domineered and controlled. Spencer's inactivity has also been seen by film critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc as a precursor to Lynch's 1983–92 comic strip The Angriest Dog in the World.|$|E

5|$|Kiarostami's {{style is}} notable {{for the use}} of long shots, such as in the closing {{sequences}} of Life, and Nothing More... and Through the Olive Trees, where the audience is intentionally distanced physically from the characters to invite reflection on their fate. Taste of Cherry is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is in conversation with a passenger. The physical distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{judgment}} {{has been}} criticised as being unusually short-sighted because {{he failed to}} see that while his decision was correct for that particular case, the precedent it would set would create an unfair monopoly for the booksellers and publishers. This {{was one of only}} a small number of cases in which Mansfield was overruled; in his entire career only six of his judgments were overturned by a higher court. Mansfield's judgement here <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> part of a wider agenda; along with other legal figures such as Sir William Blackstone, he was personally in favour of a perpetual copyright.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{reaching}} {{its peak in}} the first half of the sixteenth century, between the reigns of James IV and the deposition of Mary Queen of Scots. The loss of the church as a source of patronage in the 1560s and the court in 1603, changed and limited the further development of Renaissance ideas. In the same period civic humanism began to give way to private devotion and retreat from the world influenced by Stoicism. In art and architecture, Renaissance proportion began to give way to Mannerism and the more exaggerated style of the Baroque from about 1620.|$|E
