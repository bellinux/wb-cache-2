40|$|Increasing egg storage {{duration}} affects egg internal quality, especially albumen quality by increasing pH and decreasing Haugh Unit (HU). But, {{in most of}} African contexts, egg producers, sellers and consumers store the eggs in different conditions regardless of quality deterioration. In this study, 1920 eggs produced by Lohmann layer flocks of 48 weeks and 58 weeks of age were investigated. The eggs were divided randomly and equally in 4 groups and stored at 3 different conditions for 21 days at: 1) Room Conditions (RoC); 2) Super Market Conditions (SmC) and 3) Refrigerator Conditions (RfC). During storage, all the eggs were weighed and Resonant Frequency (RF) were measured at day 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 according to flock age and storage condition. Then at the same days, sample of 30 eggs per flock and per storage condition were used to measure albumen pH and HU. The results indicate that eggs weight decreased significantly with {{storage duration}} (P< 0. 001). But, egg relative weight loss was lower (P< 0. 01) for eggs of RfC group than that of SmC and RoC groups. There was a positive linear relationship between RF and storage duration. But, daily increase in RF was affected by layer flock age. The highest daily increase was obtained in RoC group or SmC group, respectively for flock of 48 weeks of age or flock of 58 weeks of age. Eggs of RfC groups had the highest albumen HU and the lowest albumen pH (P< 0. 001).

The mixture was cooled and then stored <b>in</b> a <b>refrigerator</b> for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> eight months to allow natural fermentation to take place. All ingredients were sourced from retail outlets. The Toroi was examined at intervals over eight months {{for a range of}} pathogens (seven in all) that have been related to incidents of food poisoning in ready-to-eat foods in New Zealand. The survival of a faecal contamination indicator, the laboratory grown strain Escherichia coli NZRM 916, was mapped over eight months. Two strategies to prevent the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in Toroi were also investigated. Only one of the seven pathogens sought was recovered from any sample. This pathogen was Bacillus cereus, a spore-former known to be associated with vegetables. All batches contained B. cereus on the day of preparation but after two weeks refrigerated storage there was no further recovery from any sample. There was a very low incidence of natural E. coli in the Toroi, consistent with levels permitted in mussels sold in retail outlets. The laboratory grown strain, E. coli declined substantially over two months and was not recovered from any samples at eight months. A laboratory grown strain of Listeria monocytogenes, (L 70) was added to Toroi and grew well with an increase in concentration of about seven-fold, over 19 days storage <b>in</b> a <b>refrigerator.</b> A bacteriocin producing lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus sake Lb 706, was added in combined culture with L. monocytogenes to Toroi.

When a purified bacteriocin; nisin, was added, a concentration of 10 mg g- 1 in the Toroi was required to eliminate L. monocytogenes. The inhibition study results suggest that unacceptably high inocula or purified bacteriocin would be required to prevent the growth of L. monocytogenes in Toroi. The results of this suggest that Toroi be prepared from mussels either purchased from a retail outlet or harvested from sites known to be free from contamination. Toroi should be safe to eat if prepared carefully, chilled promptly and thoroughly and allowed to ferment for at least two weeks. In addition, care should be taken to maintain Toroi at refrigerated temperatures until it is eaten...|$|R

Once the environment is split into three;a hot, cold and work reservoirs a heat engine can operate.

Reversing the operation transforms the device into a quantum refrigerator. The quantum tricycle, a device connected by three external leads to three heat reservoirs is used as a template for engines and refrigerators. The equation of motion for the heat currents and power can be derived from first principle. Only a global description of the coupling of the device to the reservoirs is consistent with the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Optimisation of the devices leads to a balanced set of parameters where the couplings to the three reservoirs are of the same order and the external driving field is in resonance. When analysing refrigerators special attention is devoted to a dynamical version of the third law of thermodynamics.

By adjusting the thermostat, the maximum and minimum temperature achieved during the system operation are changed, and also the range between them. Having all that in mind, the aim of this study is to optimize the temperature range <b>in</b> a domestic <b>refrigerator</b> <b>in</b> order to make power consumption as low as possible while maintaining a given maximum temperature that cannot be exceeded in order to keep the food properly preserved. The refrigerator was modeled as a first order plus time delay system. A hysteretic relay test was used to estimate the system parameters. The system model was employed to develop mathematical relations to set the temperature amplitude inside the refrigerator, given a maximum temperature, in order to minimize the total energy consumption. Preliminary results indicated that, for the <b>refrigerator</b> studied <b>in</b> this work, the optimal amplitude should be set at approximately 7 Â°C, when the refrigerator is half loaded. This amplitude could save <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 15 % of energy when compared to 2 Â°C amplitude or 35 % when compared to 1 Â°C amplitude. Further tests will be conducted on the refrigerator to identify the system, as well as to measure the power consumption when different temperature ranges are set. ...|$|R

50|$|Commission D1 Refrigerated Storage {{deals with}} the storage of all {{products}} which require temperature control, such as food and pharmaceuticals. Industrial, commercial and residential storage are also taken into account so that, in cooperation with Commission D2 Refrigerated Transport, the entire cold chain is treated, from raw materials to the final product at our home. Refrigeration plays an essential role for perishable products. While the estimated capacity of refrigerated warehouses was over 500 million cubic meters worldwide in 2014, in some countries global food losses {{due to the lack}} of a cold chain are still very important and can reach as much as 20% of the global food supply. At the same time, in heavily industrialised countries, the use of commercial and domestic <b>refrigerators</b> accounts for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 6% of global electricity consumption.|$|R
50|$|A quantum {{heat engine}} is {{a device that}} generates power from the heat flow between hot and cold reservoirs. The {{operation}} mechanism of the engine can be described {{by the laws of}} quantum mechanics. The first realization of a quantum heat engine was pointed out by Geusic, Schultz-DuBois and Scoville., showing the connection of efficiency of the Carnot engine and the 3-level maser.Quantum refrigerators share the structure of quantum heat engines with the purpose of pumping heat from a cold to a hot bath consuming powerfirst suggested by Geusic, Bois and Scoville. When the power is supplied by a laser the process is termed optical pumping or laser cooling, suggested by Weinland and Hench.Surprisingly heat engines and <b>refrigerators</b> can operate <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the scale of a single particle thus justifying the need for a quantum theory termed quantum thermodynamics.|$|R

With its large superconducting particle accelerators and detector magnets, CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, has become a major world center in helium cryogenics, with several large helium <b>refrigerators</b> having capacities <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 18 kW @ 4. 5 K. Combining a small fraction of these resources with the expertise of three laboratories at the forefront of turbulence research, has led to the design, swift implementation, and successful operation of GReC (Grands Reynolds Cryogéniques) a large axisymmetric turbulent-jet experiment. With flow-rates <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 260 g/s of gaseous helium at ~ 5 K and atmospheric pressure, Reynolds numbers <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 107 have been achieved in a 4. 6 m high, 1. 4 m diameter cryostat.
