5|$|For 1966, {{the engine}} {{capacity}} limit in Formula One was doubled from 1.5litres (92cuin) to 3litres (183cuin). It was not feasible to enlarge existing 1.5-litre engines to take <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> {{of the higher}} limit and Climax chose not {{to develop a new}} 3-litre motor, leaving many teams without a viable engine for 1966.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Peart began taking <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of the {{advances}} in electronic drum technology, primarily incorporating Roland V-Drums and {{continued use of}} samplers with his existing set of acoustic percussion. His digitally-sampled library of both traditional and exotic sounds has expanded over the years with his music.|$|E
5|$|This time Thomas {{planned to}} launch {{simultaneous}} sorties from four gates. The main sector {{was to be}} again the Thomas gate, to take <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of the exhausted Muslim corps stationed there. The attacks from the other gates—Jabiya Gate, the Small Gate and the Eastern Gate—were intended to tie down the other Muslim corps {{so that they could}} not aid Shurhabil's corps at the Thomas gate.|$|E

5|$|Arnhem {{restored}} much of Model's self-confidence, {{which had}} been shaken by the experience of Normandy. From September to December, he fought another Allied thrust to a standstill, this time by Omar Bradley's U.S. 12th Army Group into the Hürtgen Forest and Aachen. While he interfered less in the day-to-day movements of his units than at Arnhem, he still kept himself fully informed on the situation, slowing the Allies' progress, inflicting heavy casualties and taking <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of the fortifications of the Westwall, known to the Allies as the Siegfried Line.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, Menem sported an image {{similar to the}} old caudillos, such as Facundo Quiroga and Chacho Peñaloza. He groomed his sideburns in a similar style. His presidential inauguration was {{attended}} by several gauchos. Contrary to Peronist tradition, Menem did not prepare huge rallies in the Plaza de Mayo to address {{the people from the}} balcony of the Casa Rosada. Instead, he took <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of mass media, such as television.|$|E
5|$|The Crimson Echoes {{project was}} {{launched}} by ZeaLitY in 2004. The development team, dubbed Kajar Laboratories, primarily consisted {{of members of}} the Chrono fansite Chrono Compendium. The team was led by a game director, Agent 12, and two co-directors, ZeaLitY and Chrono'99. To create a story that was compatible with Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross, the team took <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of the Chrono Compendium's encyclopedia and the fandom's knowledge and analysis of the series.|$|E

5|$|The Glidden barn is of {{pole and}} beam construction. The second-floor {{interior}} {{is dominated by}} two large transverse wooden beams. It is of the three-bay, English tradition, the west bay containing a space for a stairwell leading to a hayloft and seven stalls. It is constructed of red brick and stands on a foundation of limestone. Glidden's barn took <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of the term vernacular; the brick was locally manufactured and the limestone locally quarried.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} envisioned to take <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of the hardware, without the {{imposition}} of porting to older platforms like the PlayStation 3. The hardware let developers improve the particle system that lights Delsin's face up while he draws neon power from billboards and add detailed reflections to the game world. The increased memory bandwidth let the team render characters with higher fidelity. They found the PS4's simplified architecture so {{easy to work with}} {{that they were able to}} reach very high graphical quality even though the hardware was new.|$|E
5|$|Although Howe {{was in a}} {{favourable}} position, Villaret had {{not been}} idle during the night. He had attempted, with near success, to distance his ships from the British fleet; when dawn broke at 05:00 he was {{within a few hours}} of gaining enough wind to escape over the horizon. Allowing his men to breakfast, Howe took <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of his position on the weather gage to close with Villaret, and by 08:12 the British fleet was just four miles (6km) from the enemy. By this time, Howe's formation was strung out in an organised line parallel to the French, with frigates acting as repeaters for the admiral's commands. The French were likewise in line ahead and the two lines began exchanging long-range gunfire at 09:24, whereupon Howe unleashed his innovative battleplan.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} assumption that plug-in recharging {{will take place}} overnight at home, residents of cities, apartments, dormitories, and townhouses do not have garages or driveways with available power outlets, and they might {{be less likely to}} buy plug-in electric vehicles unless recharging infrastructure is developed. Electrical outlets or charging stations near their places of residence, in commercial or public parking lots, streets and workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of PHEVs, {{and in the case of}} EVs, to avoid the fear of the batteries running out energy before reaching their destination, commonly called range anxiety. Even house dwellers might need to charge at the office or to take advantage of opportunity charging at shopping centers. However, this infrastructure is not in place and it will require investments by both the private and public sectors.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{attempts}} at peaceful negotiation by FRELIMO were abandoned and, on September 25, 1964, Eduardo Mondlane began to launch guerrilla attacks on targets in northern Mozambique from his base in Tanzania. FRELIMO soldiers, with logistical {{assistance from the}} local population, attacked the administrative post at Chai Chai {{in the province of}} Cabo Delgado. FRELIMO militants were able to evade pursuit and surveillance by employing classic guerrilla tactics: ambushing patrols, sabotaging communication and railroad lines, and making hit-and-run attacks against colonial outposts before rapidly fading into accessible backwater areas. The insurgents were typically armed with rifles and machine pistols, and the attackers took <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of the monsoon season in order to evade pursuit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} {{the signing of the}} peace, the two states responsible for its structure, Persia and Sparta, took <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of the gains they had made. Persia, freed of both Athenian and Spartan interference in its Asian provinces, consolidated its hold over the eastern Aegean and captured both Egypt and Cyprus by 380 BC. Sparta, meanwhile, in its newly formalized position atop the Greek political system, took advantage of the autonomy clause of the peace to break up any coalition that it perceived as a threat. Disloyal allies were sharply punished—Mantinea, for instance, was broken up into five component villages. With Agesilaus {{at the head of the}} state, advocating for an aggressive policy, the Spartans campaigned from the Peloponnese to the distant Chalcidic peninsula. Their dominance over mainland Greece would last another sixteen years before being shattered at Leuctra.|$|E
25|$|The poles used on trolleybuses are {{typically}} longer than those used on trams, {{to allow the}} bus to take <b>fuller</b> <b>advantage</b> of its not being restricted to a fixed path in the street (the rails), by giving a degree of lateral steerability, enabling the trolleybus to board passengers at curbside.|$|R

5|$|Just as {{the battle}} began, the Swedish {{flagship}} Kronan sank, taking with it almost the entire crew, including the Admiral of the Realm and commander of the Swedish navy, Lorentz Creutz. The allied force {{under the leadership of}} the Dutch admiral Cornelis Tromp took <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of the ensuing disorder on the Swedish side. The acting commander after Creutz's sudden demise, Admiral Claes Uggla, was surrounded and his flagship Svärdet battered in a drawn-out artillery duel, then set ablaze by a fire ship. Uggla drowned while escaping the burning ship, and with the loss of a second supreme commander, the rest of the Swedish fleet fled in disorder.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the war was a {{complete}} Byzantine victory, and Tzimiskes decided to take <b>full</b> <b>advantage.</b> Although he initially recognized Boris II as the legitimate Bulgarian tsar, after the fall of Dorostolon his intentions changed. This became evident during his triumphal return to Constantinople, where the emperor entered the Golden Gate behind a wagon carrying an icon of the Virgin Mary as well as the Bulgarian regalia, with Boris and his family following behind Tzimiskes. When the procession reached the Forum of Constantine, Boris was publicly divested of his imperial insignia, and at the church of Hagia Sophia, the Bulgarian crown was dedicated to God.|$|E
5|$|The {{project is}} a {{continuation}} of the Norwegian National Rail Administration's plan to build four tracks along the three main corridors out of Oslo; the Gardermoen Line was completed in 1998, and the Asker Line has been completed in 2011. Between 1989 and 1996, the Østfold Line south of Ski to Moss was upgraded to double track and higher speeds. To take <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of this and allow the rest of the Østfold Line to be upgraded for high speeds, it is necessary to increase capacity through the bottleneck from Oslo to Ski. The first plans for the Follo Line were launched in 1995, and also included an intermediate station at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The new line is predicted to increase rush hour rail ridership 63%, and increased freight on rail would remove 750 trucks daily from European Route E18.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} running jokes {{throughout}} the series. Established in Goldfinger is Q's continuing disgust at how his equipment is often lost, {{damaged or destroyed}} by Bond during missions. Another is how easily distracted Bond is in the lab ("Now pay attention") as Q rattles off details {{about the use of}} the equipment which Bond needs to commit to memory. Another part of the customary byplay between Q and Bond is Bond's amused reaction to the latest devices and the Quartermaster's indignant response ("I never joke about my work"). There are also sight gags showing prototype equipment. In the field, however, Bond always remembers the details and takes <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of the tools supplied.|$|E
5|$|In 118 BC, King Micipsa of Numidia (current-day Algeria and Tunisia) died. He was {{succeeded by}} two {{legitimate}} sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal, and an illegitimate son, Jugurtha. Micipsa divided his kingdom between these three sons. Jugurtha, however, {{turned on his}} brothers, killing Hiempsal and driving Adherbal out of Numidia. Adherbal fled to Rome for assistance, and initially Rome mediated {{a division of the}} country between the two brothers. Eventually, Jugurtha renewed his offensive, leading to a long and inconclusive war with Rome. He also bribed several Roman commanders, and at least two tribunes, before and during the war. His nemesis, Gaius Marius, a legate from a virtually unknown provincial family, returned from the war in Numidia and was elected consul in 107 BC over the objections of the aristocratic senators. Marius invaded Numidia and brought the war to a quick end, capturing Jugurtha in the process. The apparent incompetence of the Senate, and the brilliance of Marius, had been put on full display. The populares party took <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of this opportunity by allying itself with Marius.|$|E
5|$|Optically, the HST is a Cassegrain {{reflector}} of Ritchey–Chrétien design, as {{are most}} large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, {{is known for}} good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes {{that are hard to}} fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited to take <b>full</b> <b>advantage</b> of the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light. On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.|$|E
50|$|This concept emerges {{due to the}} {{enormous}} design freedom provided by AM technologies. To take <b>full</b> <b>advantages</b> of unique capabilities from AM processes, DFAM methods or tools are needed. Typical DFAM methods or tools includes topology optimization, design for multiscale structures (lattice or cellular structures), multi-material design, mass customization, part consolidation, and other design methods which can make use of AM-enabled features.|$|R
