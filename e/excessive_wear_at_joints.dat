40|$|The {{implementation}} of the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) forces the small and medium enterprises {{to have a high}} competition between the manufacturer from China and the ASEAN member countries. One of the competitions occurs on the market of centrifugal pump for fisherman ship. The SME product, made in Tegal, has a lower price but also has a short lifespan. The imported product is now preferred by the fisherman due to its better performance and its longer lifespan. The main problem of the SME pump comes from the <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> <b>at</b> the pump shaft, indicated by a collection of deep scratch at two locations in pump shaft. This paper investigates the cause of the <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> <b>at</b> the SME pump shaft and compares the quality of the SME and imported shaft by conducting material characterization, mechanical testing, and design evaluations. The chemical composition, hardness property, tensile strength, geometrical analysis and bearing design of the both shaft products are compared. Results show that the SME product uses a higher quality material shaft but ignores the good engineering design in developing the fisherman pump shaft product. The absence of the bearing mounting design on the shaft, the lack of lubricant volume and the low quality of the seals on the SME pump product induce the undesirable wear on the pump shaft. The improvement of the shaft design is required to increase the quality of the SME pump...|$|R

From the experiments, the following results are mainly attained: (1) The reasons of tool wear in the low cutting speed will be not attributed to chemical interaction between tool and work due to temperature, but the actions of mechanical attrition. (2) The amount of wear in water base cutting fluids is remarkably different from dry or cutting oils, which is attributed to the differences of falling type of the built-up-edge and type of chip flow. (3) The selections of suitable cutting conditions and tool materials for the work materials are the most significant for using water base cutting fluids at the low cutting speed...|$|R

In the approach, the flexible component was modeled by using absolute nodal coordinate formulation-based element, while the rigid component {{was described by}} employing the natural coordinate formulation. The clearance joint was modeled as a dry contact pair, in which the continuous contact force model proposed by Lankanrani and Nikravesh was applied to evaluate the normal contact force, and the friction effect was considered using the LuGre friction model. The calculation of wear was performed by an iterative wear prediction procedure based on Archard’s wear model. Using this approach, a planar slider–crank mechanism including a flexible rod and clearance joint was numerically investigated as a demonstra-tive example. Furthermore, {{the effects of the}} flexibility of the mechanism and the clearance size on the <b>wear</b> <b>at</b> clearance <b>joint</b> were also studied...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturers of wind {{turbines}} have observed {{a new phenomenon}} that appears in high power {{wind turbines}}: <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> in the teeth located at 0 º in the pitch bearing. In order to design more efficient wind turbines, manufacturers are increasing the rotor diameter to capture more kinetic energy from the wind to generate more energy, therefore the stress in the joints/unions is increased, {{which leads to the}} elastic deformation of the system. These stresses and deformations increase {{in all parts of the}} wind turbine, the foundations and the tower, yaw, nacelle, drive train and blade unions. All these cases are mainly static unions, except the drive train that transmits torque, the yaw system that turns the nacelle and the pitch system that turns each blade around its axis. The weight of the blades under movement, always working in the most efficient position, causes micro-movements allowed by the elastic deformations and the backlash of the gear transmission that induce an <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> <b>at</b> the zero degree position. The same phenomenon is observed in the yaw system, though to a lesser extent. Despite the manufacturer's efforts, a solution that could be implemented in the near future or easily retrofitted in the wind turbines does not yet exist. The aim of this PhD project is to improve the lubrication of the pitch and yaw gear systems of wind turbines through the use of a novel lubrication system based on an array of micro-fabricated channels fitted at the gears' root (dedendum). A micro-nozzle to continuously inject fresh grease in between the teeth in contact has been designed, manufactured and installed in a test bench of a 2 MW wind turbine pitch system. The test bench has been used to characterize the fatigue behavior of the gear surface using conventional wind turbine greases under real cyclic loads, showing a delay of 2 x 10 ^ 4 cycles in the appearance of wear. The proposed micro-nozzle is expected to be compatible with and easily implemented into both newly designed and in-market models. This novel lubrication system will inject fresh lubricant to the gear contact area even when the wind turbine is generating electricity. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} nickel {{additions}} to tune the wear performance of Cu 45. 5 Zr 51 Al 3. 5 at. % alloy {{has been studied}} to present a new strategy for preventing <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> rate <b>at</b> high loads in metallic glass composites. This strategy consists of proper selection of a doping element in controlled concentrations {{with the ability to}} decrease the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the alloy so that the friction temperature during sliding is close to the Tg. This enables the formation of crystalline phases and their subsequent oxidation (lubricating layer) on the contact surface during sliding thus enhancing the wear resistance. Proper doping can also contribute towards the wear resistance when the content of the doping element promotes the martensitic transformation. The results show that the main wear mechanism for the three studied alloys (Cu 45. 5 Zr 51 Al 3. 5, Cu 44. 5 Zr 51 Al 3. 5 Ni 1 and Cu 43. 5 Zr 51 Al 3. 5 Ni 2 at. %) is governed by delamination and the mass loss increases with increasing load from 1 to 10 N. However, for the maximum load of 15 N, the calculated friction temperature is close to Tg for the Ni-containing alloys and partial crystallization and oxidation take place resulting in a mass loss decrease from about 2. 6 mg (at 10 N) to about 2. 1 mg (at 15 N) ...|$|R

To use the full technological potential of this solution, roughness models and a technology database have to be developed in order to enable process planning on an industrial level. Diamond turning is an established manufacturing process for finishing operations with a high geometrical freedom. Conventional turning is limited to non-ferrous, a few crystalline and plastic materials. The affinity between the carbon of the diamond and materials, like iron, leads to <b>excessive</b> tool <b>wear</b> even <b>at</b> very short cutting distances. The technology of ultra-sonic assisted diamond turning enables the direct machining of e. g. steel and combines the advantages of diamond turning with a higher range of machinable materials.
