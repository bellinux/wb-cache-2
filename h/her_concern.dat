5|$|On {{his way to}} a meeting, Webber {{goes through}} a red light, and collides with another vehicle, {{resulting}} in him becoming T-boned.

25|$|Despite her {{increasing}} {{deviation from}} orthodox Freudian doctrine, she practiced and {{taught at the}} Berlin Psychoanalytic Society until 1932.

25|$|Talbot {{advocated}} {{a much more}} active and scientific approach to home economics than prevailed in subsequent decades.

25|$|Kelly's {{interest}} in skepticism derives {{in part from}} <b>her</b> <b>concern</b> about how fake mediums and psychics exploit gullible or vulnerable people.
