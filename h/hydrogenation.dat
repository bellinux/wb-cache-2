5000|$|Most {{processes}} involving hydrogen rely on metal-based catalysts. Whereas bulk <b>hydrogenations,</b> e.g. margarine production, rely on heterogeneous catalysts, For {{the production}} of fine chemicals, such <b>hydrogenations</b> rely on soluble organometallic complexes or involve organometallic intermediates. [...] Organometallic complexes allow these <b>hydrogenations</b> to be effected asymmetrically.|$|R
40|$|Dihydrogen {{reactions}} are mainly reaction-center-mediated. In a systematic approach, these {{reactions are}} divided into the steps of splitting of H- 2 and H-atom transfers with homolytic and heterolytic splitting at mono- and dinuclear reaction centers, and further homopolar H transfers in Wilkinson-type <b>hydrogenations</b> (insertion and reductive elimination) and heteropolar transfers in ionic <b>hydrogenations</b> (hydride before proton, proton before hydride, simultaneous hydride/proton transfers). Based on these categories, transfer <b>hydrogenations</b> are also surveyed. A separate class of reactions is one-electron reactions of dihydrogen...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} of chiral alcohols and amines by using iridium catalysis is reviewed. The methods presented include {{the reduction of}} ketones or imines by using hydrogen (<b>hydrogenations),</b> isopropanol, formic acid, or formate (transfer <b>hydrogenations).</b> Also dynamic and oxidative kinetic resolutions leading to chiral alcohols and amines are included. Selected literature reports from early contributions to December 2012 are discussed. AuthorCount: 3;</p...|$|R
5|$|The best-known rhodium-halogen {{compound}} is the Wilkinson's catalyst chlorotris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium(I). This catalyst {{is used in}} the hydroformylation or <b>hydrogenation</b> of alkenes.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{complexes}} {{are being}} investigated as catalysts for asymmetric <b>hydrogenation.</b> These catalysts {{have been used}} in the synthesis of natural products and able to hydrogenate certain difficult substrates, such as unfunctionalized alkenes, enantioselectively (generating only one of the two possible enantiomers).|$|E
5|$|Nickel and its alloys are {{frequently}} used as catalysts for <b>hydrogenation</b> reactions. Raney nickel, a finely divided nickel-aluminium alloy, is one common form, though related catalysts are also used, including Raney-type catalysts.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Takasago's Professor Ryōji Noyori won the 2001 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for {{the study}} of chirally catalyzed <b>hydrogenations.</b>|$|R
50|$|Urushibara nickel is not pyrophoric. It can be {{used for}} most <b>hydrogenations</b> where W-7 grade Raney nickel {{can be used}}.|$|R
50|$|Tetraarylcyclopentadienones are a well studied {{class of}} ligands in {{organometallic}} chemistry. The Shvo catalyst, useful for certain <b>hydrogenations,</b> {{is derived from}} tetraphenylcyclopentadienone.|$|R
5|$|Several {{chromium}} compounds {{are used}} as catalysts for processing hydrocarbons. For example, the Phillips catalyst, prepared from chromium oxides, {{is used for the}} production of about half the world's polyethylene. Fe-Cr mixed oxides are employed as high-temperature catalysts for the water gas shift reaction. Copper chromite is a useful <b>hydrogenation</b> catalyst.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{production}} difficulty and high price, lutetium has very few commercial uses, especially {{since it is}} rarer {{than most of the}} other lanthanides but is chemically not very different. However, stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation, <b>hydrogenation,</b> and polymerization applications.|$|E
5|$|Shale oil {{extraction}} process decomposes oil shale and converts its kerogen into shale oila petroleum-like synthetic crude oil. The process is conducted by pyrolysis, <b>hydrogenation,</b> or thermal dissolution. The efficiencies of extraction processes are often evaluated by comparing their yields {{to the results}} of a Fischer Assay performed on a sample of the shale.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hydrogenations</b> using {{a variety}} of {{catalysts}} (e.g. Raney nickel or Platinum dioxide) or specific reductions (e.g. named reactions such as Rosenmund reduction).|$|R
50|$|Many {{catalytic}} cycles operate via complexes that {{alternate between}} 18-electron and square-planar 16-electron configurations. Examples include Monsanto acetic acid synthesis, <b>hydrogenations,</b> hydroformylations, olefin isomerizations, and some alkene polymerizations.|$|R
50|$|Palladium {{on carbon}} {{is used for}} {{catalytic}} <b>hydrogenations</b> in organic synthesis. Examples include reductive amination, carbonyl reduction, nitro compound reduction, and the reduction of imines and Schiff bases.|$|R
5|$|Rhenium in {{the form}} of rhenium-platinum alloy is used as {{catalyst}} for catalytic reforming, which is a chemical process to convert petroleum refinery naphthas with low octane ratings into high-octane liquid products. Worldwide, 30% of catalysts used for this process contain rhenium. The olefin metathesis is the other reaction for which rhenium is used as catalyst. Normally Re2O7 on alumina is used for this process. Rhenium catalysts are very resistant to chemical poisoning from nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus, and so are used in certain kinds of <b>hydrogenation</b> reactions.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} ignores {{energy and}} deals {{only with the}} molecular complexity estimated by the information entropy index. It speculates that the points of several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, dihydroxyacetone, uracil, cytosine, glycine, and alanine) fall into {{the range of the}} values typical for the known interstellar molecules that indicates high probability of their detection in interstellar environment. Additionally the molecules with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the interstellar set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of the molecules with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) chemical structures, so the detectable molecules with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) fullerene molecules supports this assumption. It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of <b>hydrogenation</b> of interstellar entities: the molecules with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.|$|E
5|$|Nickel {{is one of}} four {{elements}} (iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium) {{that are}} ferromagnetic at approximately room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is valuable in modern times chiefly in alloys; about 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, 9% in plating and 4% in other applications, including the fast-growing battery sector. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for <b>hydrogenation,</b> cathodes for batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.|$|E
50|$|Type II rearrangements often involve double {{hydrogen}} {{migration in}} a carbon skeleton. This reaction type {{can be found}} in certain transfer <b>hydrogenations.</b> An example is hydrogen transfer in syn-sesquinorbornenedisulfones.|$|R
40|$|Research into {{directed}} <b>hydrogenations</b> for acyclic stereocontrol {{peaked in}} the 1980 s. 1 Much {{of that work}} involved 1, 1 -disubstituted alkenes that are sterically noncongested and easy to hydrogenate. Examples involving trisubstituted alkenes are rarer and tend to feature homoallylic alcohols. 2 In these cases, high diastereoselec-tivities are possible because simultaneous coordination of the metal to the hydroxyl and alkene gives rigid, chairlike intermediates. However, there are relatively few examples of useful acyclic stereocontrol in <b>hydrogenations</b> of trisubstituted alkenes that are allylic alcohols, or where no alcohol at all is present. There is {{a good reason for}} this. Most of the work on directed <b>hydrogenations</b> has featured rhodium and iridium catalysts of the type MP 2 where P 2 is a chelating diphosphine ligand, and these do not hydrogenate trisubstituted alkenes at a significant rate if a directing group is not present. This is not so, however, for Crabtree’s catalyst 3 – 6 an...|$|R
50|$|The {{transient}} iminium intermediate is chiral {{which is}} transferred to the reaction product via chiral induction. The catalysts {{have been used in}} Diels-Alder reactions, Michael additions, Friedel-Crafts alkylations, transfer <b>hydrogenations</b> and epoxidations.|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} use of {{platinum}} is {{as a catalyst}} in chemical reactions, often as platinum black. It has been employed as a catalyst since the early 19th century, when platinum powder was used to catalyze the ignition of hydrogen. Its most important application is in automobiles as a catalytic converter, which allows the complete combustion of low concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst {{in a number of}} separate processes, but especially in catalytic reforming of straight-run naphthas into higher-octane gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as Adams' catalyst, is used as a <b>hydrogenation</b> catalyst, specifically for vegetable oils. Platinum also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and it is used in fuel cells as a catalyst for the reduction of oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Catalytic <b>hydrogenation</b> has diverse {{industrial}} uses. Most frequently, industrial <b>hydrogenation</b> {{relies on}} heterogeneous catalysts.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, Calvin {{discovered}} that copper(II) complexes oxidized H2. The 1960s witnessed {{the development of}} well defined homogeneous catalysts using transition metal complexes, e.g., Wilkinson's catalyst (RhCl(PPh3)3). Soon thereafter cationic Rh and Ir were found catalyze the <b>hydrogenation</b> of alkenes and carbonyls. In the 1970s, asymmetric <b>hydrogenation</b> was demonstrated in the synthesis of L-DOPA, and the 1990s saw the invention of Noyori asymmetric <b>hydrogenation.</b> The development of homogeneous <b>hydrogenation</b> was influenced by work started in the 1930s and 1940s on the oxo process and Ziegler–Natta polymerization.|$|E
40|$|AbstractUsing nonequilibrium Greenʼs {{functions}} {{in combination with}} the density functional theory, we investigated the electronic transport behaviors of zigzag graphene nanoribbon (ZGNR) heterojunctions with different edge <b>hydrogenations.</b> The results show that electronic transport properties of ZGNR heterojunctions can be modulated by <b>hydrogenations,</b> and prominent rectification effects can be observed. We propose that the edge dihydrogenation leads to a blocking of electronic transfer, as well as the changes of the distribution of the frontier orbital at negative/positive bias might be responsible for the rectification effects. These results may be helpful for designing practical devices based on graphene nanoribbons...|$|R
25|$|Endocyclic imines do {{not suffer}} from {{complications}} due to syn/anti isomerization; however, {{this has not}} {{proven to be a}} significant advantage in enantioselective <b>hydrogenations.</b> 3-Hydroindoles may be reduced with hydrogen gas and an iridium catalyst.|$|R
50|$|Platinum {{on carbon}} {{is used for}} {{catalytic}} <b>hydrogenations</b> in organic synthesis. Examples include carbonyl reduction, nitro compound reduction, secondary amine production via nitrile reduction, {{and the production of}} saturated heterocycles from their respective aromatic compound precursors.|$|R
25|$|In {{the second}} step, the metallointermediate formed is a {{saturated}} compound that can rotate and then break down, again detaching the alkene from the catalyst. Consequently, {{contact with a}} <b>hydrogenation</b> catalyst necessarily causes cis-trans-isomerization, because the isomerization is thermodynamically favorable. This {{is a problem in}} partial <b>hydrogenation,</b> while in complete <b>hydrogenation</b> the produced trans-alkene is eventually hydrogenated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrogenation</b> – {{to treat}} with {{hydrogen}} – is a chemical reaction between molecular hydrogen (H2) and another compound or element, {{usually in the}} presence of a catalyst such as nickel, palladium or platinum. The process is commonly employed to reduce or saturate organic compounds. <b>Hydrogenation</b> typically constitutes the addition of pairs of hydrogen atoms to a molecule, often an alkene. Catalysts are required for the reaction to be usable; non-catalytic <b>hydrogenation</b> takes place only at very high temperatures. <b>Hydrogenation</b> reduces double and triple bonds in hydrocarbons.|$|E
25|$|The largest scale {{application}} of <b>hydrogenation</b> {{is for the}} processing of vegetable oils. Typical vegetable oils are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (containing more than one carbon-carbon double bond). Their partial <b>hydrogenation</b> reduces most, but not all, of these carbon-carbon double bonds. The degree of <b>hydrogenation</b> is controlled by restricting the amount of hydrogen, reaction temperature and time, and the catalyst.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} alkene and alkyne <b>hydrogenations,</b> both the homogeneously and heterogeneously catalyzed versions, is that hydrogen addition occurs with [...] "syn addition", with hydrogen entering from the least hindered side.

40|$|N-ethyl {{riboflavin}} efficiently catalyzes the hydrazine mediated {{reduction of}} carbon-carbon double bonds. This strategy allows chemo-selective reductions in complex molecules that {{are prone to}} racemization, olefin isomerization, or hydrogenolysis in transition metal-catalyzed <b>hydrogenations.</b> The high functional group tolerance of this methodology is demonstrated as well. ...|$|R
