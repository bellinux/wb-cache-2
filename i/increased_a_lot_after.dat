40|$|Abstract“Local Culture” {{has become}} one of the most {{interesting}} fields for many studies, as it has always been referred to in some of its phases as the main cause of social and environmental defects. This research is highlighting the impacts of the 25 th revolution on both of local culture and environmental behavior during the revolution and up till now, and pointing out the different environmental attitudes those have been noticed within cities and rural areas. The research also focuses on certain phenomena concerning both natural & built environment such as the huge and uncontrolled increasing in informal buildings and building on agriculture lands which <b>increased</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>after</b> the revolution...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: After {{the liberation}} of Selective Availability (S/A) several GPS {{receivers}} started to have enough accuracy or precision for work with grid sampling in Precision Agriculture. There are few articles describing the accuracy and precision of these receivers. The objective of this work was compared and calculated the accuracy of two models very used for grid sampling in Brazil. The study was done in a flat surface, common in the Cerrados region. The geographical reference was determined by DGPS collecting data for 10 hous. The tested models (Garmin GPSIII Plus and Garmin etrex Vista) were evaluated for 5 days {{in the period of}} 7 a. m. to 17 p. m. The concept of Circular Error Probability (CEP) was uded for the accuracy and precision calculation. The model Garmin GPSIII Plus presented CEP 50 % = 3, 6 m, CEP 90 % = 6, 7 m, CEP 95 % = 7, 4 and CEP 98 % = 8, 2 m. The model Garmin etrex Vista presented CEP 50 % = 3, 3 m, CEP 90 % = 6, 2 m, CEP 95 % = 6, 2 and CEP 98 % = 7, 6 m. Both models presented different error patterns, while the model GPSIII Plus presented aleatory error the etrex Vista presented systematic error (several points overlapped). It was also noticed that the GPS error <b>increased</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>after</b> 15 p. m. for both. In the Cerrados region the grid sampling used by the farmers is much larger than this; therefore the accuracy and precision are enough for grid sampling. 200...|$|E

40|$|Speech {{recognition}} {{is very popular}} field of research and speech classification improves the performance for speech recognition. Different patterns are identified using various characteristics or features of speech to do there classification. Typical speech features set consist of many parameters like standard deviation, magnitude, zero crossing representing speech signal. By considering all these parameters, system computation load and time will <b>increase</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> so there is need to minimize these parameters by selecting important features. Feature selection aims to get an optimal subset of features from given space, leading to high classification performance. Thus feature selection methods should derive features that should {{reduce the amount of}} data used for classification. High recognition accuracy is in demand for speech recognition system. In this paper Zernike moments of speech signal are extracted and used as features of speech signal. Zernike moments are the shape descriptor generally used to describe the shape of region. To extract Zernike moments, one dimensional audio signal is converted into two dimensional image file. Then various feature selection and ranking algorithms like t-Test, Chi Square, Fisher Score, ReliefF, Gini Index and Information Gain are used to select important feature of speech signal. Performances of the algorithms are evaluated using accuracy of classifier. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as the learning algorithm of classifier and it is observed that accuracy is improved <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>after</b> removing unwanted features...|$|R
