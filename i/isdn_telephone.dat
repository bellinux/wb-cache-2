2500|$|... "Cryptophon" [...] (or [...] "Cryptofon") was {{the name}} Floricic chose for his {{prototype}} of an <b>ISDN</b> <b>telephone</b> with integrated voice encryption. It {{was created in the}} winter term 1997–1998 as part of his diploma thesis, titled [...] "Realisierung einer Verschlüsselungstechnik für Daten im ISDN B-Kanal" [...] (German, meaning, [...] "Implementation of Cryptography for Data contained in the ISDN Bearer channel"), [...] at the Technische Fachhochschule Berlin. Floricic focused on making the Cryptophon cheap and easy to build for hobbyists. The phone encrypts telephone calls using the symmetric encryption algorithm IDEA. As IDEA is patented, the cipher was implemented on a replaceable daughter module which would have allowed the user to exchange IDEA for another (probably patent-unencumbered) algorithm. In addition, the system was about to be supplemented with a key exchange protocol based on the asymmetric algorithm RSA in order to achieve security against compromised remote stations.|$|E

[...] The DOTS, upgraded and frequently referred to as [...] "DOTS +", permits airlines to save fuel by flying random routes, in contrast to structured routes, and permits the air traffic controller to achieve lateral spacing requirements more efficiently. [...] The DOTS generates flexible oceanic tracks that are optimized for best airspace utilization and best time/fuel efficiency. [...] Flexible tracks are updated twice a day using forecasted winds aloft and separation (vertical and lateral) requirements. [...] The DOTS oceanic traffic display gives a visual presentation of tracks and weather. [...] The DOTS sends traffic advisories and track advisories to users and receives aircraft progress reports from the commercial communications service providers (CCSP). [...] These external data exchanges are achieved through interfaces with the National Airspace Data Interchange Network (NADIN) Packet Switch Network (PSN) for Position Reports, Air Traffic Management (ATM) messages, Pilot Reports (PIREPS), and the Anchorage FDP2000.

McGlaughlin often voices the same narration section multiple ways, attempting to find the most concise and entertaining way to present the information, which also gives the producers editing options when they finalize each show.|$|R

Significant events at the most high-profile games - almost always in the Premier League - are described by the studio panel who each watch a game on a monitor.

50|$|Morton {{pioneered the}} use of <b>ISDN</b> digital <b>telephone</b> {{technology}} to broadcast nationally {{from his home in}} the Shetland Islands. For several years his radio show came mostly from The Radiocroft, an ISDN-equipped crofthouse in the remote north of Shetland's Mainland. However, in December 2008, after months of unreliability, the local exchange was struck by lightning during a broadcast and the Tom Morton show went off air. A decision was taken to move the show to the BBC studios in Lerwick, at local radio station BBC Radio Shetland. During frequent visits to the UK mainland, the show came from BBC studios in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen, Oban, Inverness, Wick, Ayr, Tunbridge Wells, Stranraer and other temporary ISDN linked studios.|$|R
50|$|In public networks, {{the maximum}} cable length of an U bus is between 4 and 8 km, and the maximum length of an S0-bus is 900 meters for Point-to-Point {{configuration}} and about 150-300m for point-to-multipoint configurations. The Up0-bus has, depending on cable quality, a reach of between 2 and 4 km, {{far more than}} the S0-bus. This allows the use of <b>ISDN</b> <b>telephone</b> equipment in large private networks.

5000|$|Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) {{is a set}} of {{communication}} standards for simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data, and other network services over the traditional circuits of the public switched telephone network. It was first defined in 1988 in the CCITT red book. [...] Prior to <b>ISDN,</b> the <b>telephone</b> system was viewed as a way to transport voice, with some special services available for data. The key feature of ISDN is that it integrates speech and data on the same lines, adding features that were not available in the classic <b>telephone</b> system. The <b>ISDN</b> standards define several kinds of access interfaces, such as Basic Rate Interface (BRI), Primary Rate Interface (PRI), Narrowband ISDN (N-ISDN), and Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN).|$|R
