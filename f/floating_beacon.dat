50|$|Fitzball {{was educated}} in Newmarket, was apprenticed to a Norwich printer in 1809. He {{produced}} some dramatic pieces {{at the local}} theatre, and eventually the marked success of his Innkeeper of Abbeville, or The Ostler and the Robber (1820), together with the friendly acceptance {{of one of his}} pieces at the Surrey Theatre by Thomas John Dibdin, induced him to settle in London. During the next twenty-five years, he produced a great number of plays, most of which were successful. He had a special talent for nautical drama. His <b>Floating</b> <b>Beacon</b> (Surrey Theatre, 19 April 1824) ran for 140 nights, and his Pilot (Adelphi, 1825) for 200 nights. He also produced a seminal play on The Flying Dutchman and wrote the libretto for Edward Loder's Raymond and Agnes. His greatest triumph in melodrama was perhaps Jonathan Bradford, or Murder at the Roadside Inn (Surrey Theatre, 12 June 1833). He was at one time stock dramatist and reader of plays at Covent Garden, and afterwards at Drury Lane. He had a considerable reputation as a songwriter and as a librettist in opera. He wrote the librettos for William Vincent Wallace's operas Maritana and Lurline. The last years of his life were spent in retirement at Chatham, where he {{died at the age of}} 81.|$|E
30|$|Traditional turn-by-turn {{navigation}} {{systems as}} {{commonly found in}} smartphone apps provide an efficient means for guiding navigation through complex environments. However, they are also highly vulnerable to signal degradation due to urban canyons (i.e. tall buildings blocking satellite signals (Cui & Ge, 2003)), are readily jammed by portable consumer technologies (i.e. GPS denial (Coffed, 2014)), can distract attention away from other tasks (Lee et al., 2014), and severely limit memory for newly experienced environments (Bakdash, Linkenauger, & Proffitt, 2008; Chrastil & Warren, 2013; Gardony et al., 2015; Gardony, Brunyé, Mahoney, & Taylor, 2013). These limitations have encouraged research and development toward identifying novel methods for guiding pedestrian navigation through complex environments. For instance, beacon-based visual navigation aids can show the general direction and distance to a destination, without providing explicit instructions on which routes to take (Brunyé et al., 2016 a). In a series of virtual environment navigation experiments, we previously demonstrated the utility of a <b>floating</b> <b>beacon</b> overlaid onto a virtual scene, showing the direction and distance to a goal destination (Brunyé et al., 2016 a). In that work, the accuracy of beacon registration predicted {{the extent to which}} the beacon increased path efficiency and trust in the system. Similarly, vibrotactile beacons can accomplish a similar function by providing orientation-specific pulses around the torso or leg, guiding a pedestrian without occupying their visual modality (Boll, Asif, & Heuten, 2011; Cosgun et al., 2014; Van Erp et al., 2005). These innovative approaches to navigation guidance are intended to help pedestrians maintain attention on the environment and active engagement in the spatial decision process and thus reduce the negative impact of turn-by-turn navigation on spatial memory formation. They can also rely on inertial navigation data and compass direction to support beacon use during limited satellite reception (Woodman, 2007), for instance in urban canyons, unmapped subterranean areas, contested environments, and disaster-relief zones.|$|E
40|$|In 1820, the United States Government began funding {{construction}} and conversion of watercraft {{for use as}} lightships. <b>Floating</b> <b>beacons</b> utilized to mark dangerous shoals, reefs, and shifting channels in inland as well as open waters, lightships served where lighthouse construction was unfeasible. This study intends to examine the general history of U. S. lightships, improvements to construction design, technological modifications in illumination and signaling, venue of employment, as well as use, re-use, and the maritime cultural landscape associated with these craft.   M.

30|$|Sixty-nine {{individuals}} participated for monetary compensation; 19 participants {{failed to}} complete the task due to mild simulator sickness (n[*]=[*] 11) or difficulty performing the wayfinding task (i.e. not completing the task within 1.5  h; n[*]=[*] 8). The resulting sample consisted of 38 men and 12 women (Mage[*]=[*] 23.3). Each participant completed a sequence of 40 wayfinding trials, in a within-participants design. They were provided with several opportunities to view a <b>floating</b> on-screen <b>beacon</b> for 5  s, to show them the general direction of each destination. All procedures were approved by the institutional review boards at Tufts University and the U.S. Army (# 1310028).|$|R
50|$|He was {{collector}} of the ports of Cleveland, {{and built a}} lighthouse {{of which he was}} superintendent in 1831. The US Treasury paid him $4,997.00 on the lighthouse and $113.30 for expenditures for it. The land cost $1,000.00. He also built a lighthouse on Turtle Island, Lake Erie, Port Clinton OH in 1832 for which the US Government paid him $1,068.43. The US Government also paid him in 1831 for the support and maintenance of the lighthouses, <b>floating</b> lights, <b>beacons,</b> buoys, and stakeages. He also built or established a marine hospital on which the US Treasury paid him $147.17.|$|R
6000|$|These <b>floating</b> <b>beacons</b> are {{anchored}} {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the numerous sand-banks which lie off the mouths of some of the principal ports of the kingdom, especially in England, and on other parts of our shores. There are numerous floating lights around our coasts, marking shoals on which lighthouses could not easily be erected. Their importance to shipping is inconceivably great. The accompanying illustration shows a vessel passing the lightship at the Nore. The impossibility of shipping getting safely into or out of the port of London without the guiding aid of lightships, as well as of buoys and beacons, may be made clear by a simple statement of the names of some of the obstructions which lie in the mouth of the Thames. There are the Knock Shoals, the East and West Barrows, the John, the Sunk, the Girdler, and the Long Sands, all lying like so many ground sharks waiting to arrest and swallow up passing vessels, which, unfortunately, they too often accomplish despite the numerous precautions taken to rob them of their prey. Most people know the appearance of buoys, but we dare say few have seen a buoy or beacon resembling the one in our engraving, which is a sort of cage, fastened to a buoy, with a bell inside that rings by the action of the waves. It must have been something of this sort that was used at the famous [...] "Bell Rock" [...] in days of yore.|$|R
30|$|After {{completing}} the practice, participants were placed into the urban VE. The environment was unfamiliar {{to the participants}} and they received no information about it before the wayfinding task. Participants were instructed to use all available information to find each destination and were not specifically told to move quickly or efficiently through the environment. Movement controls {{were the same as}} in the practice task. They began the task directly facing their first landmark goal (Laundromat) and were instructed to “Find the Laundromat.” Once they navigated to within a 1 -m radius of a labelled sign positioned in front of the landmark, the sequence of 40 trials began. Trial order was fixed across participants and each landmark was used twice as a destination (except for one landmark, the market); trials were of variable length and complexity. The overall route visited the sequence of 40 landmarks in a fixed pseudo-random order with a minimum of five landmark destinations occurring before being instructed to revisit a landmark. During each of the 40 trials, the participants could request up to five <b>floating</b> <b>beacons</b> to help orient them toward the current destination’s general direction. They requested a beacon by pressing the spacebar and it remained on-screen for 5  s; participants could continue to move during this time. The beacon always pointed {{in the direction of the}} current destination and if it was outside of the participant’s current field of view a red arrow pointed left or right to indicate the beacon’s location. After the 5  s elapsed, the beacon disappeared; there was no minimum request interval, so beacons could be requested immediately after one another. As depicted in Fig. 1 b, the software always noted the number of beacons remaining for use and the current destination goal; it also depicted a compass rose in the upper right corner. Upon arrival at each successive destination, the next trial was triggered (e.g. “You have found the Laundromat. Now find the Pet Store.”). Once the participant successfully navigated between all 40 target destinations, the task finished. Finally, they completed the individual differences tasks and questionnaires.|$|R
30|$|In {{our first}} experiment, {{pedestrian}} navigation was simulated in a large-scale urban desktop virtual environment, with participants navigating point-to-point {{in the environment}} (e.g. first to the pet store, then to the laundromat, etc.). To ensure an uninformed search occurred, participants were completely unfamiliar with the environment, including its landmarks, road network, and structure. While wayfinding to each destination, participants could request a <b>floating</b> visual <b>beacon</b> overlaid onto the virtual environment, up to five times during each origin-to-destination trial, to help guide them in the correct direction. If wayfinders seek information to inform a decision before entering an intersection, navigation aid requests should occur in path segments, not in intersections; furthermore, requests should predict an approach to (rather than departure from) an intersection. Finally, if requesting a beacon facilitates a decision before entering an intersection, then executing a behavior (i.e. continuing straight or turning) in the intersection should be faster when a prior beacon was requested versus when it was not. These patterns of wayfinding behavior may be correlated with spatial abilities and strategies, for instance a higher spatial sense of direction {{might be related to}} higher path efficiency and perhaps lower beacon reliance overall.|$|R
50|$|Definitive prototypes of the Ka-25 {{incorporated}} {{mission equipment}} and corrosion {{protection for the}} structure. The rotor system introduced aluminium alloy blades pressurised with nitrogen for crack detection, lubricated hinges, hydraulic powered controls, alcohol de-icing and automatic blade folding. Power was supplied by two free-turbine engines sat atop the cabin, with electrically de-iced inlets, plain lateral exhausts with no Infra-Red countermeasures, driving the main gearbox directly and a cooling fan for the gearbox and hydraulic oil coolers aft of the main gearbox. Construction was of stressed skin duralumin throughout with flush-riveting, {{as well as some}} bonding and honeycomb sandwich panels. The 1.5m × 1,25m × 3.94m cabin had a sliding door to port flight deck forward of the cabin and fuel tanks underfloor filled using a pressure refueling nozzle on the port side. A short boom {{at the rear of the}} cabin had a central fin and twin toed in fins at the ends of the tailplane mainly for use during auto-rotation. The undercarriage consisted of two noncastoring mainwheels with sprag brakes attached to the fuselage by parallel 'V' struts with a single angled shock absorber to dissipate landing loads, and two castoring nosewheels on straight shock absorbing legs attached directly to the fuselage either side of the cockpit which folded rearwards to reduce interference with the RADAR, all wheels were fitted with emergency rapid inflation flotation collars. Flying controls all act on the co-axial rotors with pitch, roll and collective similar to a conventional single rotor helicopter. Yaw was through differential collective which has a secondary effect of torque, an automatic mixer box ensured that total lift on the rotors remained constant during yaw maneuvers, to improve handling during deck landings. Optional extras included fold up seats for 12 passengers, rescue hoist, external auxiliary fuel tanks or containers for cameras, flares, smoke <b>floats</b> or <b>beacons.</b>|$|R
60|$|These sand-sharks (if we may {{be allowed}} the expression) {{separate}} the main channels, which are named respectively the Swin or King's channel, on the north, and the Prince's, the Queen's, and the South channels, on the south. The channel through which the Nora passed was the Swin, which, though not used by first-class ships, {{is perhaps the most}} frequented by the greater portion of the coasting and colliery vessels, and all the east country craft. The traffic is so great as to be almost continuous; innumerable vessels being seen in fine weather passing to and fro {{as far as the eye}} can reach. To mark this channel alone there was, at the time we write of, the Mouse light-vessel, at the western extremity of the Mouse sand; the Maplin lighthouse, on the sand of the same name; the Swin middle light-vessel, at the western extremity of the Middle and Heaps sand; the Whittaker beacon, and the Sunk light-vessel on the Sunk sand--besides other beacons and numerous buoys. When we add that <b>floating</b> lights and <b>beacons</b> cost thousands and hundreds of pounds to build, and that even buoys are valued in many cases at more than a hundred pounds each, besides the cost of maintenance, it may be conceived that the great work of lighting and buoying the channels of the kingdom--apart from the light-house system altogether--is one of considerable expense, constant anxiety, and vast national importance. It may also be conceived that the Elder Brethren of the Corporation of Trinity House--by whom, from the time of Henry VIII down to the present day, that arduous duty has been admirably performed--hold a position of the highest responsibility.|$|R
40|$|A {{seafloor}} multi-sensor module with {{real-time data}} transmission, named CUMAS (Cabled Underwater Module for Acquisition of Seismological data), has been deployed in January 2008 in the Gulf of Pozzuoli, in the Campi Flegrei caldera (southern Italy), {{which is one}} of the most active volcanic areas in the world. The sensors installed in CUMAS were selected to monitor a set of signals related to the local seismicity as well as the ground uplift and subsidence of the seafloor that are related to the bradyseismic phenomenon. In particular, together with a broad-band three-component seismometer and a low-frequency hydrophone, a seafloor water-pressure sensor is used to assess the feasibility of measurements of the slow vertical movement of the seafloor (bradyseism). Further sensors are acquired by two embedded Linux computers, namely tilt and heading sensors for the measure of the actual module orientation on the seafloor, and status sensors that monitor the state of health of the vessel (e. g., internal temperature, power absorption, water intrusion). The underwater acquisition systems are linked to a support infrastructure, a <b>floating</b> buoy (elastic <b>beacon),</b> through an electro-mechanical cable with an Ethernet line. The buoy provides the needed power supply thanks to batteries charged by solar panels and a wind- generator. A Wi-Fi antenna on the buoy is used to transmit the seafloor data from the sea surface to the land acquisition centre in the city of Naples. A meteorological station is also mounted on the buoy, to allow the correlation of the air and seafloor data. CUMAS, although based on commercial sensors, relies on an original system for the centralized management of a wide set of geophysical and physical oceanographic sensors, that handles the continuous data acquisition and real-time data transmission. After the installation in the Gulf of Pozzuoli at about 100 m w. d., and after a test period, CUMAS uninterruptedly operated from May 2008 to June 2009, thus providing continuous geophysical data to the Monitoring Center of the Campi Flegrei volcanic areas, managed by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia. The long-term operational performance of CUMAS is presented here, together with the first results from the analysis of the geophysical long time-series acquired. Examples of the acquired signals, especially geophysical data, will be presented to point out the high quality in term of signal-to-noise ratio. In particular, earthquake recordings obtained from the hydrophone resulted of comparable quality to the seismic data acquired on land by the permanent network, thus demonstrating the suitability of hydrophones to monitor the seismic activity of the caldera...|$|R
