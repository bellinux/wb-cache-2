5|$|Commentators noted McCotter's lack of name {{recognition}} hindered his chances for nomination. When included in Republican presidential preference polls, he regularly received {{less than one}} percent support. Following a last place finish in the Ames Straw Poll and the lack of any invitation to presidential debates, he dropped his candidacy on September 22, 2011, and endorsed Mitt Romney. Thereafter, McCotter reportedly wrote a television pilot, which was released to the media prior to his resignation from Congress in July 2012 amid a <b>fraud</b> <b>investigation</b> surrounding his congressional re-election campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{legality}} of the bat'leth in the United States differs between states. In 2009, a replica bat'leth was used in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in two armed robberies.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered and seized a bat'leth as part of a cache of weapons in connection with a $4 million Medicare <b>fraud</b> <b>investigation</b> in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Apple {{was named}} among others as a {{defendant}} in a suit brought by plaintiff Typhoon Touch Technologies in the federal U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging patent infringement in portable touch screen technology. The suit illustrated the vagaries of litigating patent licensing and royalty collection issues in the commercial exploitation of intellectual property rights. Ultimately, Typhoon could not prevail against patent defense arguments of prior art and obviousness and earned itself {{a reputation as a}} patent troll. Typhoon acquired two pre-existing patents, (filed in 1993 and 1994 and issued in 1995 and 1997), in mid-2007 for $350,000 plus a percentage of collected licensing fees. The patents had languished for some time and were not being policed; shortly after Typhoon acquired the patents, it began enforcement by bringing suit against exploiters of the technology who had not paid licensing fees. Typhoon was successful in its patent infringement suits against some small companies, and then expanded its litigation to go after larger ones. Typhoon alleged that Apple and others used its patented technology inventions without permission. Typhoon originally filed the suit in December 2007 against Dell after settling with some smaller companies but, in mid-2008, amended its complaint to add Apple, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Lenovo, Panasonic, HTC, Palm, Samsung, Nokia, and LG. In 2010, Apple settled with Typhoon for an undisclosed sum and was then dismissed from the litigation as of September 2010. The other large companies were able to rebuff Typhoon's claims, and Typhoon ceased doing business in 2008 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suspended its trading in a <b>fraud</b> <b>investigation.</b>|$|E

500|$|Though McCotter {{had decided}} to run for reelection in his congressional district, he failed to qualify for his district's Republican primary after the {{majority}} of his petitions were declared fraudulent. An investigation of the campaign by the office of the Michigan Attorney General ensued. McCotter argued that [...] "somebody either panicked or it was sabotage... My gut tells me that we got lied to by someone we trusted." [...] Steve Kornacki suggested the fraud may have been related to the presidential campaign, if it [...] "caused him to take his eye off the ball on his House reelection," [...] but McCotter rejected this as an [...] "idiotic line of thinking." [...] He initially hoped to wage a write-in campaign, but decided against it, finding he could not run the campaign while cooperating with the investigation and serving the remainder of his term in Congress. A month later, he resigned from Congress, claiming this was needed to fully assist with the petition <b>fraud</b> <b>investigation.</b> The investigation found that in addition to the 2012 petitions, McCotter's Congressional reelection petitions from 2006, 2008, and 2010, also showed evidence of fraud. McCotter sued two aides accusing them of intentional sabotage. Eventually, four aides, including one who was sued, were charged and convicted of violations related to the fraud.|$|E
