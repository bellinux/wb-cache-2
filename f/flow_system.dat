Based on this thought relationships that characterize animate systems are tested in relation to cities and countries, and some conclusions are drawn...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Aeration is {{the process}} by which the area of contact between water and air is increased, either by natural methods or by {{mechanical}} devices. Proper aeration can make considerable improvements in a pond ecosystem. This paper investigates pond aeration by two phase <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> such as high head gated conduit <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> and two phase pipe <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> using venturi tubes. When the gate of a high head outlet conduit is partly opened or a minimal amount of differential pressure exists between the inlet and outlet sides of the venturi tube, air suction occurs at air vents. In two phase <b>flow</b> <b>systems,</b> air that is entrained into the water will be momentarily forced downstream in the form of small air bubbles. The dissolution of oxygen into the water results from the air suction downstream of high head gated conduit and venturi tube, and the rising air bubbles into pond. Moreover, high pressure in two phase <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> also facilitates the dissolution of oxygen into the water. Therefore, two phase <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> have an extremely high efficiency for transferring oxygen from air bubbles to water. It was observed from the results that two phase <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> were more efficient in deep ponds than in shallow ponds...|$|R

500|$|In 1990, {{the tidal}} <b>flow</b> <b>system</b> was {{abandoned}} and the Albert Bridge was converted back to two-way traffic. A traffic island was {{installed on the}} south end of the bridge to prevent larger vehicles from using it. In the early years of the 21st century the Chelsea area experienced a growth in the popularity of large four-wheel drive cars (so-called Chelsea tractors), many of which were over the two-ton weight limit; it was estimated that one third of all vehicles using the bridge were over the weight limit. In July 2006 the [...] wide roadway was narrowed to a single lane in each direction to reduce the load.

500|$|Death Valley National Monument was {{designated}} a biosphere reserve in 1984. On October 31, 1994, the monument was expanded by 1.3 million acres (5,300km2) and re-designated {{as a national}} park, via congressional passage of the California Desert Protection Act (Public Law 103-433). Consequently, the elevated status for Death Valley made it the largest national park in the contiguous United States. Many of the larger cities and towns within the boundary of the regional ground water <b>flow</b> <b>system</b> that the park and its plants and animals rely upon are experiencing some of the fastest growth rates of any place in the United States. Notable examples within a [...] radius of Death Valley National Park include Las Vegas and Pahrump, Nevada.

500|$|Sponges do {{not have}} {{distinct}} circulatory, respiratory, digestive, and excretory systems – instead the water <b>flow</b> <b>system</b> supports all these functions. They filter food particles {{out of the water}} flowing through them. Particles larger than 50micrometers cannot enter the [...] and pinacocytes consume them by phagocytosis (engulfing and internal digestion). Particles from 0.5μm to 50μm are trapped in the ostia, which taper from the outer to inner ends. These particles are consumed by pinacocytes or by archaeocytes which partially extrude themselves through the walls of the ostia. Bacteria-sized particles, below 0.5micrometers, pass through the ostia and are caught and consumed by choanocytes. Since the smallest particles are by far the most common, choanocytes typically capture 80% of a sponge's food supply. Archaeocytes transport food packaged in vesicles from cells that directly digest food to those that do not. At least one species of sponge has internal fibers that function as tracks for use by nutrient-carrying archaeocytes, and these tracks also move inert objects.|$|E

The new maneuvers employed in Dream Drop Distance are also meant to give a glimpse about how the next game in the series, Kingdom Hearts III, would look like. New worlds were included in the game as a result of multiple requests by fans. The switches between player characters Sora and Riku across the game are meant to contrast the style from Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep, which allowed the player to use three characters in their own campaigns, as well as explain the word [...] "Distance" [...] in the title because the two characters never interact across their stories. The Free <b>Flow</b> <b>system</b> was made using data from Birth by Sleep, which took nearly two weeks to obtain a form similar to the one from the game. The game originally intended to use returning Heartless and Nobodies as generic enemies. However, the setting gave the staff the idea of introducing new creatures, Dream Eaters, who would also join the player in fights. They were also inspired in part by Nintendogs + Cats—Nomura wished that his virtual dog could battle with other pets met through Streetpass and created the Dream Eaters based on this concept. They are used in the mini-game Flick Rush which originally intended to allow players to use a picture. Nomura did not approve of this idea.|$|E
