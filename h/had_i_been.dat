A guy that's been a lifer in prison has a different attitude toward life and death." [...] Other influences included Tony Todd, who had appeared as a Hirogen in the fourth season episode [...] "", and Hertzler subsequently compared the costumes that he and Todd wore in their roles, saying [...] "The frustrating thing for me was that Tony got to wear shoulder pads, a huge chest piece, a fabulous helmet. I didn't get any of that. I was in a skintight rubber suit. <b>Had</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> 23, I would have been much happier, but at 49?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1896, the English {{translation}} of Der Judenstaat appeared in London as The Jewish State. Herzl had earlier confessed {{to his friend}} Max Bodenheimer that he [...] "wrote what I had to say without knowing my predecessors, {{and it can be}} assumed that I would not have written it [...] <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> familiar with the literature".|$|E
2500|$|Lincoln {{later told}} Congressman Deming of Connecticut that he {{believed}} the war could have been terminated at Chancellorsville had Hooker managed the battle better: specifically, [...] "when Hooker failed to reinforce Sedgwick, after hearing his cannon..." [...] But, he added, [...] "I {{do not know that}} I could have given any different orders <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> with them myself. I have not fully made up my mind how I should behave when minie-balls were whistling, and those great oblong shells shrieking in my ear. I might run away." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brown had {{campaigned on}} fixing Oakland's schools, but [...] "bureaucratic battles" [...] {{dampened}} his efforts. He concedes {{he never had}} control of the schools, and his reform efforts were [...] "largely a bust". He focused instead {{on the creation of}} two charter schools, the Oakland School for the Arts and the Oakland Military Institute. Defending his support of a military charter school in Oakland, Brown once told KQED reporter Stephen Talbot, [...] "I believe that <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> sent to the military academy, as my mother and father threatened, I would have been president a long time ago." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{three and}} a half years I dodged the war as much as I could - and I regret not having had the courage shown by the great Karl Liebknecht to say No and refuse to serve in the military. Of this I am ashamed. I used many means not to get shot and not to shoot [...] not once the worst means. But I would have used all means, all without exception, [...] <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> forced to do so: I wouldn't have said no to bribery or any other {{punishable}} acts. Many did just the same.|$|E
2500|$|Tibbits {{himself was}} {{described}} by one later owner of Tibbits, Dennis Vanes, as [...] "the greatest 'pusher' in Michigan." [...] He added, [...] "Mr. Tibbits was a hustler by nature, broad minded and liberal and always ready to help the needy and suffering. [...] He was outspoken in his sentiments and sometimes gave offense where none was intended." [...] Barton {{was the son of}} Allen Tibbits, one of Coldwater's founders. [...] After returning to Coldwater after the Civil War to start his tobacco and cigar business, Tibbits found himself involved in a variety of local projects and buildings [...] "including the skating rink, cart factory, and oil stove industry. He even purchased a number of steamboats to navigate the local lakes." [...] According to Tibbits himself, the opera house was one of the costliest projects of his career. [...] He stated, [...] "I attribute to this enterprise the Opera House my downfall, and the sacrifice of a business, which <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> selfish, would today have made me a millionaire." [...] Indeed, the venture broke Tibbits financially {{by the end of his}} life.|$|E

If not, all professions of {{religion}} will avail me nothing. If not, let me confess my sins to God, and repent and amend at once, {{whatever it may}} cost me. The fulfilling these plain duties is the true test of my faith, the true sign and test whether I really believe in God and in Jesus Christ our Lord. Do I believe {{that the world is}} Christ's making? and that Christ is governing it? Do I believe that these plain family relationships are Christ's sacred appointments? Do I believe that our Lord Jesus was made very man of the substance of His mother, to sanctify these family relationships, and claim them as the ordinances of God His Father? ...|$|R

2500|$|Wanrow was {{an active}} speaker for the women's movement, which raised funds on her behalf. The American Indian Movement helped Wanrow, too, and took {{advantage}} of the opportunity to highlight unequal treatment of Native Americans by the criminal justice system. [...] Ellen Earth, a spokesperson of the Yvonne Wanrow Defense Committee, is quoted as saying that the committee wanted to [...] "make the trial last as long as possible" [...] in order to reeducate [...] "the jury about Indians". [...] Wanrow stated, [...] "The trial would not have taken place <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> an affluent white woman who killed an American Indian. [...] Instead, after one week, I was convicted by an all-white jury on May 13, 1973 (Mother's Day) for killing a known child molester. [...] I had heard about Wesler's background as a sex offender the night before the shooting, but was not allowed to bring up the information at trial. [...] The police tape played a role in bringing about the conviction [...] the jury was allowed to hear it two times." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometime during 1965 Ibárruri {{flew from}} Paris to Dubrovnik to {{apologize}} {{as president of}} the PCE to Josip Broz Tito. On May 17, 1948, the Cominform, successor to the ECCI, had expelled Yugoslavia from the community of Socialist countries and Ibárruri had lent her voice and pen to his censure. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held February 14–26, 1956, repudiated the charges against Yugoslavia. Now Ibárruri {{came face to face with}} the man she had slandered. She started to apologize profusely, but Tito cut her short and said, [...] "Do not vex yourself, Dolores, do not worry. I know very well how things worked in those days. I know it perfectly. Furthermore, believe me, I most likely would have done what you did <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> in your situation." [...] Ibárruri returned to visit Yugoslavia several times thereafter. In late December 1965 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR decorated Ibárruri with an Order of Lenin medal. A total of 431,418 decorations were given out between 1930 and 1991, but only seventeen went to foreigners.|$|E
2500|$|The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh {{arrived in}} England on 7 March 1874. The town of Windsor was {{decorated}} in their honour, with Union Jacks and Russian flags, and Maria {{was given a}} great welcome by the waiting crowds. Queen Victoria met them at the South-Western Station and recorded their arrival in her journal: [...] "I took dear Marie {{in my arms and}} kissed her warmly several times. I was quite nervous and trembling, so long <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> in expectation ... Dear Marie has a very friendly manner, a pleasant face, beautiful skin and fine bright eyes ... She speaks English wonderfully well." [...] Later on, [...] Queen Victoria described her new daughter-in-law as [...] "most pleasing natural, unaffected and civil" [...] even if [...] "she was not pretty or graceful and held herself badly". [...] "I have formed a high opinion of her," [...] Queen Victoria reported, impressed with [...] "her wonderfully even, cheerful, satisfied temper – her kind and indulgent disposition, free from bigotry and intolerance, and her serious, intelligent mind – so entirely free from everything fast – and so full of occupation and interest in everything, makes her a most agreeable companion. Everyone must like her." [...] The queen also noted that Marie was [...] "not a bit afraid of Affie and I hope will have the very best influence upon him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Through their {{interactions}} and their critiques of each other, Darcy and Elizabeth come to recognise their own faults {{and work to}} correct them. Elizabeth meditates on her own mistakes thoroughly in chapter 36: [...] "How despicably have I acted!" [...] she cried; [...] "I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust. How humiliating is this discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! <b>Had</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> in love, I {{could not have been}} more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself."Other characters rarely exhibit this depth of self-reflection—or, at least, are not given the space within the novel for this sort of development. Tanner notes that Mrs. Bennet in particular, [...] "has a very limited view of the requirements of that performance; lacking any introspective tendencies she is incapable of appreciating the feelings of others and is only aware of material objects." [...] Mrs. Bennet's behaviour reflects the society in which she lives, as she knows that her daughters will not succeed if they don't get married: [...] "The business of her life was to get her daughters married: it's solace was visiting and news." [...] This proves that Mrs. Bennet is only aware of [...] "material objects" [...] and not of her own feelings and emotions.|$|E
2500|$|Romney has not {{put forward}} a clear {{statement}} {{as to whether he}} supports and would have signed, or would have opposed, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require that employers prove that differences in pay are based on qualifications, not gender, and extends the statute of limitations for filing claims of wage discrimination. The legislation was opposed by all but two Republicans in the House of Representatives and five in the Senate; {{and it was the first}} piece of legislation signed into law by President Obama. Asked in an [...] April 2012 interview if he would have signed the bill had it come before him as president, Romney said, [...] "It’s certainly a piece of legislation I have no intention of changing. I wasn’t there three years ago.... I’m not going to go back and look at all the prior laws and say <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> there which ones would I have supported and signed, but I certainly support equal pay for women and — and have no intention of changing that law, don’t think there’s a reason to.” After the topic of equal pay for women was touched on during the second presidential campaign debate between Romney and Obama in October 2012, a top Romney campaign advisor told reporters that Romney was opposed to the passage of the bill at the time but had no plan to repeal it. The following day, the campaign adviser retracted his statement, saying that he was wrong when he said that Romney had been opposed to the act.|$|E
