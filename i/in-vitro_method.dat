These {{products}} contain two effective physical and chemical components, which protects the skin from sunlight. Sun protection factor (S. P.

F of sunscreens, various in-vivo and <b>in-vitro</b> <b>methods</b> have been established. In this study, two <b>in-vitro</b> <b>methods</b> were used. In 'Transpore tape' method, sunscreen product was dispersed uniformly on the substrate to obtain a surface coverage of 2 mg/cm 2 of the product. Transmittance measured spectrophotometerically, and then S. P. F was calculated. In the second method (solvent method) different concentrations of test products were prepared in methanol. The sample's transmittance were measured to evaluate S. P. F. &# 13; Results. Results of the first method indicated a good linear relationship between measured S. P. F and the labled S. P.

40|$|In risk {{assessments}} of soil bounded pollutants, the bioaccessibility {{is defined as}} the amount of solid-solubilized phase transition fraction of pollutants, which is actual available for oral, pulmonary and dermal uptake (absorption) by human. The bioaccessibility does not express the bioavailability of pollutants, thus, the effect on organism by uptake of pollutants. However, the bioaccessibility is an excellent benchmark for the potential bioavailable amount of pollutants in soils, because more than the bioaccessible fraction cause no effects on organism function. The results enhanced the knowledge about in-vitro extraction tests to determine the bioaccessibility of soil bounded pollutants for oral, pulmonary and dermal uptake. The applicability and validity of the approaches will be discussed for selected inorganic and organic pollutants. New applicable knowledge for the pulmonary and dermal exposition pathway in soil protection is summarized. The conclusion is that a risk assessment on basis of total content of pollutants in soil samples overestimate mostly the actual human health risk. The approved and practice-oriented <b>in-vitro</b> <b>method</b> DIN 19738 : 2004 - 07 for estimating the oral bioaccessibility exhibits a good ruggedness and validity particular for the priority metals As, Pb, and Cd in soils.

In the absence of any data on the bioaccessible mineral content from commercially available millet, two varieties namely Kalukombu (native) and Maharastra Rabi Bajra (hybrid) were germinated and its effect on the bioaccessible iron and calcium content was explored using an <b>in-vitro</b> <b>method</b> which simulates gastrointestinal digestion. The millet was germinated for 72 h to facilitate maximum mineral extraction. The bioaccessibility of iron and calcium was considerably enhanced upon sprouting. This higher bioaccessibility could be attributed to decrease in antinutritional factors like phytate and oxalate as a result of germination. Changes in mineral and antinutrient content during sprouting led to significant variations in the antinutrient/mineral molar ratios which had a positive impact on the bioaccessible mineral content. Use of tap water for soaking prior to germination revealed contamination of the millet with iron. Contaminant iron in Kalukombu variety appeared to be less accessible; while the same was potentially bioaccessible in Maharashtra Rabi Bajra variety.

Measurements of the dynamic coefficient of friction (DCoF) between corneal epithelium and contact lenses, associated frictional forces, frictional energy, and corresponding cell damage were made using SkinEthic (Lyon, France) human corneal epithelial (HCE) constructs and commercially available contact lenses. Five silicone hydrogels (SiHs) and two polyhydroxyethlymethacrylate (p-HEMA) lens types were employed. Frictional forces were measured while the lens was rubbed against a construct that was moistened using a tear-like fluid.
