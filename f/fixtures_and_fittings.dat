5|$|Pick {{wanted a}} new type of {{building}} for the more open sites of the stations on the Piccadilly line's extensions. To decide what this new type should look like, he and Holden made a short tour of Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands in July and August 1930 to see the latest developments in modern architecture. Pick was disappointed with much of the new architecture that he saw in Germany and Sweden, considering it either too extreme or unsatisfactorily experimental. The architecture in the Netherlands was much more to his liking, particularly buildings by Willem Marinus Dudok in Hilversum. Although the architecture in Denmark was not considered remarkable, Pick was impressed with the way in which designers there were often responsible for all elements of a building including the interior <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{the station}} {{building}} was constructed insufficient funds meant only two {{wings of the}} basic building could be completed. Many of the typical Victorian GWR station <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> also had to be omitted. The building design {{was based on the}} GWR Ross-on-Wye station building which opened in 1890.|$|E
25|$|Never fully completed, {{the house}} passed through a {{succession}} of owners. In 1910 it was standing empty and in 1914, it was requisitioned by the British Government as an army convalescent hospital. It was again sold in 1928 and quickly sold again. In 1929, following a failed attempt to dismantle and rebuild {{the house in the}} USA, it was stripped of many of its <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> and all but abandoned.|$|E

50|$|One {{evening in}} 1892 Chetwynd invited George Alexander Baird to dine {{with him at}} his London House, 36 Curzon Street. Baird {{expressed}} his admiration for the house and Chetwynd sold it {{to him on the}} spot with all <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting.</b> Baird woke next morning in the master bedroom, the new owner, confused and hung over.|$|R
2500|$|Baird {{acquired}} his London {{house at}} 36 Curzon Street during {{an evening of}} dining and drinking with its then owner Sir George Chetwynd, another man of the turf. [...] Baird expressed his admiration for the property, at which point Chetwynd sold it to him with all <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting.</b> [...] Baird woke next morning {{in the master bedroom}} with a hangover and was told that he was the new owner.|$|R
25|$|St Patrick's Cathedral became Wardell's life's {{work and}} his most notable commission. The {{original}} plans remained unaltered during construction. The nave and its aisles were completed just ten years later, {{and the building}} was finally consecrated for use in 1897. At {{the time of his}} death in 1899, Wardell was still working on designs for the minor altars and <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings.</b> The spires which today adorn the building are not by Wardell.|$|E
25|$|Most modern {{buildings}} {{performed as}} {{they were designed to}} do, preserving life rather than keeping the interior in good order. The City Council's own new Civic Building sustained some interior damage, mainly to <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> that delayed it being reopened for a week. Others, such as the city's International Antarctic Centre and Christchurch Art Gallery, the latter of which served as the Civil Defence Headquarters during the earthquake aftermath, suffered little or no damage and were able to be used immediately.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{direction}} of the Iliffes (later the 2nd Baron and Lady Iliffe), Basildon was completely restored and refurnished. This was achieved over a period of 25 years. Many <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> were purchased from similar houses in a greater state of dereliction prior to their demolition. While often the Iliffes found great bargains, obtaining 18th-century mahogany doors and marble fireplaces, at other times their luck was less favourable; Lady Iliffe recalled attending the Mentmore Towers auction of 1975 with the intention of buying marble topped console tables for Basildon, but through economic necessity returned with only a coal-scuttle.|$|E

50|$|The Brydges lost a {{significant}} part of their fortune when the South Sea Bubble burst and their finances never recovered. Following the death of the first Duke, the very fabric of Cannons, all its contents <b>and</b> every <b>fixture</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> were auctioned to satisfy debts. A twelve-day sale began on 16 June 1747 and the sale catalogue included works by Titian, Giorgione, Raphael and Guercino. Amongst the most notable paintings were Caravaggio's Boy Bitten by a Lizard (wrongly attributed to Guercino in the catalogue) which the National Gallery in London acquired in 1986, and Nicolas Poussin's The Choice of Hercules which was purchased at the sale by Henry Hoare for Stourhead, his house in Wiltshire, where it still hangs. Of the sculptures Grinling Gibbons' carved panel The Stoning of St Stephen is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and a statue claiming to be of George II by John van Nost is in Golden Square.|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the escalating rhetoric and bellicose actions emanating from the Korean peninsula in April 2013, the United States deployed Patriot Missile Systems at its overseas military bases {{in danger of being}} struck by a North Korean missile launch. Japan took similar precautionary measures. A more permanent <b>fixture</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> in terms of Missile Defence Systems (MDS) is Israel’s Iron Dome Shield—designed to intercept rocket attacks by Hamas militants albeit more so for strategic benefit and less so for defending the civilian population. Both defence shields / systems, however, are designed for the same purpose—to intercept missile attacks during the ‘free flight’ phase (noting that this is specifically used in the ‘Ballistic Missile Defence context’). This article examines whether use of missile defence shields help support the existence of a wider right of anticipatory self-defence. The article also addresses the point at which an‘automated’ response takes place. Does such a response fall within the barometers of necessity and proportionality that govern a state’s lawful recourse to self-defence under international law...|$|R
25|$|In 2010, a {{complete}} African mahogany pilaster {{from the first}} class lounge, fluted with an intricate gilt acanthus motif and intact rams head capital, was discovered and restored to its former glory. Since 2012, it has been on permanent display in the Discovery Museum's Segedunum Annex at Wallsend, {{just a few hundred}} yards from where it was carved and installed in the Swan Hunter fitting out basin, over a century earlier. Many examples of the liner's <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> exist in private collections as well, including large sections of moulding, panelling, ceilings, samples of her turbine blades and much more.|$|E
25|$|An {{auction of}} the ground's <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> {{took place in}} July 2003, raising £100,000, which was donated to {{community}} projects in the Moss Side area, which was undergoing a lengthy regeneration process. The two penalty spots and the centre spot {{were thought to be}} the most desired mementos, but all three had been cut out from the grass before the auction took place. The auction lasted for seven hours and 1,000 supporters attended the auction with interest from clubs such as Preston North End and Norwich City for the bigger lots which could be reused.|$|E
25|$|In 1932 Beaudesert {{and about}} 2,000 acres of {{adjoining}} land {{went on sale}} at auction in Lichfield. Sadly no buyer was found for the estate, although the nine lodges were all purchased. In 1935 a further sale was held to sell off {{the fabric of the}} hall and stables including <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings.</b> The sale for the whole of the fabric of the hall and stables recouped £8,000, and some 20,000ft2 of wood paneling were taken away to grace other buildings. Demolition began in 1935, however was not entirely completed as the demolition firm went bust during the work.|$|E
5000|$|A {{spokesman}} for Historic England said [...] "The site was remarkably well-preserved externally and internally. It displayed {{the hierarchy of}} rooms in their <b>fixtures,</b> <b>fittings</b> <b>and</b> decorative treatment and retained all its external signage. Few pubs were built at this date and fewer survive unaltered".|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{after an}} initial 'walk-round sale' or auction was carried out, <b>fixtures,</b> <b>fittings</b> (<b>and</b> {{occasionally}} whole rooms) were sold off to museums or for re-installation in other properties. The main buildings were then un-roofed or demolished (see Destruction of country houses in 20th-century Britain).|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{flexibility}} and supplement the transportation power packs around the battlefield, the British Army procured a quantity of dedicated CRARRV High Mobility Trailers (CRARRV HMT). Each CRARRV HMT enables a CRARRV to transport a single (Challenger, Titan or Trojan) power pack or two Warrior power packs by altering the configuration of dedicated <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> attachment of <b>fittings.</b>|$|R
25|$|Reverend H A Norris, (a former {{chaplain}} to the hospital) {{realized in}} the early 1980s that there were old records at hospital which were historically important and should join {{the others in the}} Greater London Council Records Library (now part of the National Archives). He feared these would be thrown out by staff, and volunteers formed the 'Museum Committee' to help. They recovered much of the hospital heritage. This also included mechanical restraints, ECT machines, and some of the old <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings.</b> The largest item by far was the last original 'seclusion room' with white stained leather-covered straw padding walls and floor, this was recovered from June Ward in J block.|$|E
25|$|The housemates were Cruz, Demet, Kara, and Harrison. The White Room and its <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> {{were all}} entirely white, and the housemates had only white clothes to wear. White Room housemates were {{provided}} with a white porridge which fulfilled all nutritional needs. In {{the centre of the}} room was a red button. At any time, a housemate could press the red button if they wished to leave. This decision to leave was final and the quitting housemate could not return to the Big Brother House or the White Room. The challenge was that the housemate who stayed in the White Room the longest without pressing the red button would become a legitimate Big Brother housemate and enter the main house {{with the rest of the}} housemates.|$|E
25|$|Pickering {{railway station}} {{is the current}} {{terminus}} of the railway and serves the busy market town of Pickering. The station has been restored to its 1937 condition {{with help from the}} Heritage Lottery Fund. Original <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> have been installed in the Booking Office and Parcels Office, {{as well as in the}} Tea Room. A park-and-ride service is provided to keep traffic out of the town during busy periods. The station is home to the railway's carriage workshops, and there is also a turntable. Originally the station had an overall roof designed by the architect G.T. Andrews. This roof was removed by British Railways in 1952 due to corrosion. A replacement roof was fitted to the station between January - April 2011, as part of the NYMR's Train of Thought project. Other work includes a Learning Centre and a Visitor Centre behind the down platform. Originally, the line continued south of Pickering to join the Malton to Scarborough Line at Rillington Junction but this track has since been lifted with the last trip to Malton running on 1 July 1966, the day the freight services were withdrawn.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> of {{the hotel}} were of the most modern and up-to-date of the era and providing the very latest in technology and building standards, whilst the design intent was to create {{the feel of a}} comfortable country mansion. The hotel was fully electrified and the staircases were fully fire-proofed. The hotel also had a large ventilation shaft included in the design. The storeys were also connected by lifts which were installed by Laurence Scott & Co, who also installed the lighting and bells. Some {{of the hotel}} windows were illuminated with stained glass windows which were made by the Norwich firm of J & J King stain glass painters. The heating system and the Kitchen cookers and equipment was supplied by R. and A. Mainof Edmonton, London. Boardman’s design gave the hotel a total of 65 guest rooms over four of the storeys with the semi- circular shape of the frontage creating the attic bedrooms to have angular corners and sloping ceilings. The hotel’s first floor dining room was to facilitate private dinners and wedding receptions and consisted of a suite which could accommodate twenty people. The basement floor contained the servants' hall, and included a pantry, pastry room and several kitchens along with a suite of rooms allocated to the plate man. There were also a plate room and office rooms, including a further bedroom.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{decision}} to list a building may {{be made on the}} basis of the architectural or historic interest of one small part of the building, the listing protection nevertheless applies to the whole building. Listing applies not just to the exterior fabric of the building itself, but also to the interior, <b>fixtures,</b> <b>fittings,</b> <b>and</b> objects within the curtilage of the building even if they are not fixed.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the corner}} section has been {{refitted}} as a nightclub on both floors. The ground floor extends into the adjoining section through openings framed by paired columns supporting an entablature, {{part of which}} is missing, with a deep cornice and surmounted by false arched fanlights. Cast iron columns, located centrally, bear plaques with the date 1895. Most <b>fixtures,</b> <b>fittings</b> <b>and</b> finishes are recent, including the staircase, ceilings, air conditioning, rear kitchen and toilets.|$|R
500|$|Added {{to the new}} stands {{were several}} new developments. The Conference and Banqueting Centre, which is located behind the Rainham End, {{comprises}} the Great Hall, which can accommodate up to 600delegates for events, and twenty smaller delegate rooms. [...] The Centre {{is connected to the}} Medway Stand, thus allowing views from the banqueting suite onto the pitch, and is also licensed for wedding ceremonies. [...] The Blues Rock Café nightspot, located within the Medway Stand, is open between four and five nights a week and stages live music and screenings of major sporting events. [...] The club purchased many of the <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> for these new developments at discounted prices when the furnishings of the Millennium Dome were sold off upon its closure.|$|E
500|$|Early skyscrapers {{were mainly}} {{made up of}} small office cubicles, {{commonly}} only [...] across, which were placed adjacent to one another along long corridors, following a pattern first invented in the Oriel Chambers building in England in 1864. This allowed the average small company to rent {{a small amount of}} space using one or two offices, but held out the option for future expansion by renting additional office cubicles if required at a later date. A skyscraper office relied on natural sunlight from the windows but if necessary was dimly lit from electric desk-top lamps. By the standards of the day, these offices were very modern, with radiators, air vents, and the latest <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings,</b> and modern communication systems, including telephone and pneumatic tubes were often installed. As a result, many businesses chose to move out of their older, low-rise offices in Chicago to take up tenancy in the new skyscrapers, which were felt to be more convenient and healthier.|$|E
500|$|The {{last major}} {{building}} work {{took place during}} the reign of King GeorgeV when, in 1913, SirAston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. GeorgeV, who had succeeded EdwardVII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919)– the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. GeorgeV's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, [...] long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.|$|E
50|$|St Patrick's Church and Graveyard remains highly {{intact and}} is {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a modest, late nineteenth century rural church complex comprising a simple timber church building, a separate outside earth closet, fenced churchyard with wide grassed areas and some trees, and graveyard. Set picturesquely on a slight rise overlooking a farming district, the place retains its early setting, extent, form, fabric and function, and {{is an excellent example}} of its type. The interior of the church building retains most of its early <b>fixtures,</b> <b>fittings</b> <b>and</b> furniture (1880s-1920s).|$|R
25|$|The {{windows and}} {{front door of}} Bag End were round, a typical feature of hobbit-architecture. Its tunnels and rooms, also typically, were all built on one level. However, only lavish smials like Bag End had many rooms and cellars, with {{high-quality}} <b>fixtures,</b> <b>fittings,</b> <b>and</b> furniture. Its front door (on the south) and the porthole-like windows (all on the west) opened onto Bag End's lawns and gardens, the Party Field, and the distant countryside beyond. The main entrance sat {{on the end of}} a gated path at the end of a lane leading from the Hill Road.|$|R

2500|$|Following {{closure of}} the Dome, some Zones were {{dismantled}} by the sponsoring organisations, {{but much of the}} content was auctioned. This included a number of artworks specially commissioned from contemporary British artists. A piece by Gavin Turk was sold for far below his then auction price though Turk stated that he did not think the piece had worked. The Timekeepers of the Millennium attraction was acquired by the Chessington World of Adventures theme park in Surrey. A unique record of the memorabilia and paraphernalia of the Millennium Experience is held by a private collector in the United States. [...] Many of the <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> were also purchased by Paul Scally, chairman of Gillingham F.C., for the club's stadium.|$|E

50|$|The {{front part}} of the {{building}} housed the showroom and the offices. The showroom was 96 ft wide and 36 ft deep, and large plate glass windows looked out onto the street. Rohrheimer-Brooks, Cleveland's top interior design studio, designed and decorated the showrooms and associated spaces. These included a public office, large and small private office, women's toilet and anteroom, men's toilet, and separate men's and women's reception areas. The showroom and offices were paneled in oak stained silver-grey, although the two end walls were painted grey smooth plaster. The ceiling was open beam, and decorative crests were carved into each oak wall panel. Large lighting fixtures with Frink reflectors hung from the showroom ceiling, and the floor was covered in ceramic tile in a checked pattern with an intricate border. The reception rooms were painted with a silver-grey paint to harmonize with the showroom, and the furniture, light <b>fixtures,</b> <b>and</b> most other <b>fittings</b> were finished to look like silver.|$|R
