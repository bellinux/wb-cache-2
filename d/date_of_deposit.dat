40|$|There are two {{essential}} {{components to}} an effective “Green” OA mandate (i. e., a mandate that generates {{as close to}} 100 % compliance, as soon as possible) : (1) 	The mandate must uncouple the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposit</b> from the date the deposit is made OA, requiring immediate deposit, with no exemptions or exceptions.

40|$|In {{the normal}} course of {{business}} a bank accepts customer deposits that include checks and similar items drawn on other banks or institutions. The receiving bank passes those checks on to the institution on which they are drawn and receives cash (or credit for cash) in return (referred to as the "collection process"). The term deposit float refers to the amount of deposited items that the bank has accepted but has not yet collected. The universally followed practice until the end of 1983 had been for the receiving bank to reflect the deposited checks as liabilities to customers and as cash. In most cases, the bank pays interest from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposit.</b> Two financial institutions netted at least some portion of those amounts in their December 31, 1983 financial statements. One financial institution justified its accounting by asserting that it is merely an agent for the customer until the checks are collected and therefore has no liability or asset.

40|$|In astrophysics, Kurtz {{found that}} {{articles}} that were self-archived by their authors in Arxiv were downloaded and cited {{twice as much}} as those that were not. He traced this enhanced citation impact to two factors: (1) Early Access (EA) : The self-archived preprint was accessible earlier than the publisher's version (which is accessible to all research-active astrophysicists as soon as it is published, thanks to Kurtz's ADS system). (Hajjem, however, found that in other fields, which self-archive only published postprints and do have accessibility/affordability problems with the publisher's version, self-archived articles still have enhanced citation impact.) Kurtz's second factor was: (2) Quality Bias (QB), a selective tendency for higher quality articles to be preferentially self-archived by their authors, as inferred {{from the fact that the}} proportion of self-archived articles turns out to be higher among the more highly cited articles. (The very same finding is of course equally interpretable as (3) Quality Advantage (QA), a tendency for higher quality articles to benefit more than lower quality articles from being self-archived.) In condensed-matter physics, Moed has confirmed that the impact advantage occurs early (within 1 - 3 years of publication). After article-age is adjusted to reflect the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposit</b> rather than the date of publication, the enhanced impact of self-archived articles is again interpretable as QB, with articles by more highly cited authors (based only on their non-archived articles) tending to be self-archived more. (But since the citation counts for authors and for their articles are correlated, one would expect much the same outcome from QA too.) The only way to test QA vs. QB is to compare the impact of self-selected self-archiving with mandated self-archiving (and no self-archiving). (The outcome is likely to be that both QA and QB contribute, along with EA, to the impact advantage. ...|$|E
40|$|Obvious {{examples}} include inequities in our {{criminal justice system}} and in school funding. Much has been written on those and other topics. This article focuses on another example, specifically on how a sweeping change to an obscure banking rule regulating the check collection process has negatively affected consumers in general, and minority groups in particular. U. S. check collections require a complex system comprised of a variety of institutions including commercial banks, savings and loans, savings banks, and credit unions, as well as the customers who rely upon them to collect payments from far and near. Traditionally, the check collection process, including the timing rules under U. C. C. Article Four, was inherently cumbersome and slow to honor the payee’s right to receive immediate payment of funds from the paying bank. Frustration among payees, which grew due to not having their funds available fast enough because of delays that were inherent within the system, led lawmakers and others to reform the check collection timing rules [...] It has now been more than twenty years since Congress passed the Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA), which empowered the Federal Reserve Board of Governors to regulate the speed with which commercial banks are required to make funds available to depositors after their checks were deposited for collection. There is evidence, however, that these reforms have had an negative impact on checking account customers as a whole, but in particular, a disproportionate impact on minority communities. Specifically, by reducing the maximum amount of waiting time between the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposit</b> and the date when funds are available to deposit customers, the reforms also reduced the time that the funds were available to the check-issuing consumer. Thus, in every checking transaction, checking account customers lost the benefit of the float that was built into every transaction under the traditional U. C. C. rules. It is my thesis, therefore, that recent reforms in the timing rules that regulate the speed of the check collection process have indeed reduced the wait time for funds to be available, but have also resulted in increases in the appetite for various risky cash management alternatives by consumers to obtain the money that under old timing rules would stay in their deposit accounts for a longer period. Put another way, consumers who issued checks liked float, too! To address this problem, I will propose two recommendations that can provide a remedy for consumers, at their option. First, that the definition of “check” should be changed under both state and federal commercial law to remove the limitation that all checks are due on demand. Second, I propose that the federal check collection timing rules should be amended to require banks to honor checks that are payable on a definite due date just as they honor those that are payable on demand...|$|E
40|$|Deltas where {{luminescence}} dating is {{most essential}} due to organic-poor geologic records are also those {{where it is}} often most challenging due to unsuitable luminescence properties of quartz grains, associated with rapid production of young clastic sediment. One example is the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta (GBMD), where Himalaya uplift drives erosion, production, and delivery to the delta plain of poorly sensitized quartz sand. Luminescence <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> fluvial <b>deposits</b> may be further complicated by partial bleaching prior to deposition. Here, we use GBMD quartz and polymineral sediment, including sand and silt fractions, with constrained depositional ages between {{a few years and}} a few centuries to test novel approaches to luminescence <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> fluvial <b>deposits</b> in an otherwise challenging setting. This produces the first delta-wide assessment of GBMD sediment luminescence dateability. We use a new multiple-signal SAR (MS-SAR) bleaching index (BI) to explore zeroing of the luminescence signals of sediment prior to deposition and to quantify the IR, pIRIR, and TL residual doses of GBMD polymineral silt with well-reset BSL signals. This test establishes BI values {{that can be used to}} identify sufficient bleaching of Holocene sediment with unknown depositional ages, thereby improving confidence in quartz silt dating. We find that GBMD quartz sand is unsuitable for luminescence dating in most localities. By contrast, GBMD silt is sufficiently bleached and has universally suitable luminescence characteristics, enabling <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> GBMD <b>deposits</b> up to the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings in the GBMD establish methodology for obtaining and validating luminescence ages for fluvial deposits in challenging settings with unsuitable quartz sand. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective – To {{test the}} {{assumption}} that authors familiar with subject-based repositories {{are more likely to}} self-archive to institutional repositories. Design – Comparative content analysis. Setting – Institutional repositories (IRs) from the following seven universities: Queensland University of Technology (QUT), University of Melbourne, University of Queensland, Lund University, University of Glasgow, University of Southampton, and University of Strathclyde. The IRs included in the study were {{selected on the basis of}} repository size and use of EPrints software. Faculty size data and IR deposit policies were drawn from universities’ Websites. Methods – Each IR was searched to determine the number of deposits in the disciplines of chemistry, physics, economics and sociology. Physics and economics were selected because these disciplines have established internationally renowned subject-based repositories, in contrast to chemistry and sociology, which have not. Deposits from the disciplines were identified from subject terms, keywords and departmental names in metadata records. A “deposit rate” for the four disciplines in each IR was calculated. The metadata records were examined for name of the depositor, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposit,</b> full-text availability, item type, and format. Information in the field “Deposited By” was used to identify the extent of self-archiving (that is, deposited by the author). Faculty size for the four disciplines at the seven universities was established from departmental Web site information. For the purposes of making comparisons between the IRs, these data were converted into “rates of faculty” size by dividing the number of faculty in the department by the total number of faculty at the institution. A weighted rate of deposits by discipline was calculated by dividing the rate offaculty size by the deposit rates. To take into account disciplinary differences in publication productivity, these rates were subjected to further analysis. Using an “average publications per year” calculation for each discipline (from a 1977 paper), a final weighted rate of depositing was calculated for the four disciplines in the seven IRs. Main Results – Without weighting for faculty size, deposit rates vary greatly between disciplines. In most institutions, deposit rates for chemistry and sociology were higher than rates for physics and economics. When faculty size is controlled for, the highest deposit rates in five IRs were for chemistry and sociology. Only two IRs were found to have the highest deposit rates for physics and economics. These results did not change overall when the weighting for publishing productivity was applied: the same five IRs had highest deposit rates for chemistry and sociology. Exceptions to these findings were the IRs at University of Melbourne and University of Queensland, where the highest deposit rates were for economics and physics. On examination of depositor information, it was found that only 2. 3 % of economics deposits in the Melbourne IR were self-archived. Administrative assistants and other staffwere responsible for depositing 97. 7 % of the IR’s economics holdings. Self-archiving of physics items to the Melbourne IR was 90 %; however, these deposits comprised student theses and dissertations only. Self-archiving practices were examined for:chemistry, physics and economics deposits at the University of Melbourne; chemistry and economics at the University of Queensland; and chemistry, physics and sociology at Queensland University ofTechnology (the only IR in the sample with a mandatory deposit policy). Like Melbourne, self-archiving of economics deposits at the University of Queensland was also low, at 17 %. Of the remaining economics deposits, a librarian was responsible for depositing 68 %. Chemistry deposits at both Melbourne and Queensland had much higher self-archiving rates, 76. 2 % and 100 % respectively, than those found for physics and economics. At QUT, where deposit into the IR is mandatory, self-archiving rates are high for the three disciplines for which findings are reported. The self-archiving rate for chemistry was 68. 3 %, sociology 46. 3 %, and physics 42. 9 %. A librarian was responsible for the majority of the remaining deposits. Conclusion – This research tested the proposition that disciplines familiar with subject-based open access repositories, such as physics and economics, are more likely to contribute to IRs. Its findings did not support this view. Instead, the study found no particular pattern of deposit rate across the four disciplines of chemistry, physics, economics and sociology in the seven IRs. Operational aspects of IRs, such as assisted and mandated deposit, appear to have a more significant effect on deposit rates. Assisted deposit, either through departmental administrative staff or librarians, accounted for relatively high deposit rates for economics in the Queensland and Melbourne IRs. Deposit date information in the Queensland IR suggests administrative staff of theeconomics department deposit to the IR on an ongoing basis. Students showed a high rate of self-archiving for theses and dissertations. It might be speculated that a mandate policy at Queensland University of Technology is responsible for the high self-archiving rates seen for economics, chemistry and sociology. However, librarians have assisted in the process, depositing over half the items for physics and sociology. The author recognises the value of both assisted and mandated deposit, but raises questions about how this will affect faculty use of IRs. For example, in cases where faculty have no role in contributing to an IR and therefore no familiarity with it, will they in fact use it? Another important consideration is the policy approach taken to temporary faculty and a mobile academic workforce. In conclusion, the author states,“Institutional repositories need a mandate policy to ensure success”...|$|E
