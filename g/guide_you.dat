500|$|According to the TES (formerly the Times Educational Supplement), [...] "From April, holly blue, peacock and {{brimstone}} butterflies abound. Following the illustrated <b>guide,</b> <b>you</b> wind among {{wild cherry}} and rowan, under archways of hazel branches to a pond where damsel-flies dance in early summer. A sparrow-hawk nests {{in a silver}} birch, a jay comes visiting, bees and wood-mice also live here." [...] The TES continues: [...] "There are open glades for picnics and, in autumn, blackberries to gather. The aim here is to manage the woodland as a natural piece of countryside in town, and if, from time to time, you glimpse a tube train, you hardly notice it, beyond the trees." ...|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{interpreted}} the song's lyrics during their reviews. Its theme was noted {{to be about}} freedom. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard {{said that in the}} song, Lee is [...] "trying to convince a romantic partner to stop 'spiraling down, down, down' and help her find a new beginning." [...] Kerrang! writer Steve Beebee wrote that Lee reaches a conclusion that [...] "Love will <b>guide</b> <b>you</b> home." [...] Talking about the lyrical content of the song, Laurie Tuffrey of NME opined: [...] "It's quite hard to tell what the song's about, with lots of references to 'the unknown' and 'the pain', and it confusingly switches between suggesting people 'do what you want you want, if you have a dream for better' in the first verse and the decidedly creepier final chorus where Lee seemingly gets an ex-lover on the blower, only to tell them 'Hello, hello, it’s only me, infecting everything you love'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Orthodox Church {{does not}} {{subscribe}} to the Protestant doctrine of sola scriptura. The Church has defined what Scripture is; it also interprets what its meaning is. Christ promised: [...] "When He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will <b>guide</b> <b>you</b> into all truth". The Holy Spirit, then, is the infallible guide for the Church to the interpretation of Scripture. The Church depends upon those saints who, by lives lived in imitation of Christ, achieving theosis, can serve as reliable witnesses to the Holy Spirit's guidance. Individual interpretation occurs within the Church and is informed by the Church. It is rational and reasoned, but is not arrived at only by means of deductive reasoning.|$|E

2500|$|A {{new life}} started for Ibrahim. His mission now {{was to call}} his people to monotheism. He started with his father, the closest person to him and whom he loved greatly. He said {{to him in the}} softest and kindest voice: [...] "O father! Why do you worship that which doesn't hear, doesn't see, and cannot avail you in anything? O father, I have got {{knowledge}} which you have not, so follow me. I will <b>guide</b> <b>you</b> to a straight path." [...] His father replied angrily: [...] "Do you reject my gods, O Ibrahim? If you don't stop I will stone you to death! Get away from me before I punish you!" [...] Ibrahim replied: [...] "Peace be on you! I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 1911 Richards {{was allowed}} to go to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for {{gallstone}} surgery and returning to the Hastings jail on August 10. Richards had long-standing intestinal troubles and never fully recovered from surgery. Bartlett Richards died while incarcerated at Hastings, Nebraska {{in the early morning hours}} of September 4, 1911 before his wife could arrive by train from the family home in Coronado, California. When Will Comstock first heard the news of the partner's death, he is reported to have said, [...] "May the angels <b>guide</b> <b>you</b> into Paradise, and may the martyrs come to meet you." [...] The next day William Comstock was released and his sentence commuted by order of President William Taft so as to attend the funeral of his business partner in San Diego.|$|E
2500|$|The New Testament {{contains}} warnings against teachings {{considered to}} be only masquerading as Christianity, and shows how reference was made to {{the leaders of the}} church to decide what was true doctrine. The Catholic Church believes it is the continuation of those who remained faithful to the apostolic leadership and rejected false teachings. Papal infallibility is the belief that when a pope speaks ex cathedra as head of the Church defining a doctrine concerning faith and morals to be held by the whole Church he does so without error because of the promises made by Jesus in his act of consecration of Peter as the foundation of his church. The church bases this belief on biblical promises that Jesus made to his apostles. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus tells Peter, [...] "...the gates of hell will not prevail against" [...] the church, and in the Gospel of John, Jesus states, [...] "I have much more to tell you, but you cannot bear it now. But when he comes, the Spirit of truth, he will <b>guide</b> <b>you</b> to all truth".|$|E

2500|$|Agnese appears, {{this time}} singing for a yet-unnamed love: Aria: Silenzio – E notte intorno / [...] "Silence and night all around. May {{the voice of}} the lute <b>guide</b> <b>you</b> to me, my love". [...] As she hopes that the {{anonymous}} letter, which she has sent, and now her song will guide him to her arms, Orombello suddenly appears, but he is attracted only by the sounds of sweet music. Since the letter was written to him, she assumes an attraction to her on his part, and he is somewhat confused over this turn of events. Somewhat bluntly, she moves towards asking if he is in love, and he decides to confide in her. He confesses that he is deeply in love and, when asked about a letter which she assumes to be the one she wrote to him, he reveals that he had written to Beatrice. At that point, she realises that she has a rival: (Duet: Sì: rivale… rival regnante / [...] "A royal rival"). Agnese's expectations collapse as Orombello reveals that it Beatrice with whom he is in love and he pleads for her to understand. She is furious; her tenderness turns to vitriol and in a dramatic finale, she explodes while he attempts to protect Beatrice's honour – and her life: (Duet: La sua vita? Ma la sola, ohime! / [...] "Her life? My life means nothing to you?").|$|E
