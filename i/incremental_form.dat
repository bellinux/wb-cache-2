40|$|Proceedings of the 2011 Annual Conference on Experimental and Applied MechanicsInternational audienceAn {{incremental}} formulation {{suitable for}} modelling of materials with damaging viscoelastic behaviours is proposed in this work. A constitutive law based on linear viscoelasticity coupled with strain dependent damage is developed. The viscoelastic model {{is represented by}} a generalized Maxwell's chain. It is governed {{by a set of}} internal stress variables attached to the branches of the Maxwell's chain. The damage evolution is governed by values gained by a pseudo strain. The coupled law is turned into an <b>incremental</b> <b>form</b> suitable for the numerical analysis of damaging time dependent structures. Taking advantage of the <b>incremental</b> <b>form,</b> the coupled damaging viscoelastic law is implemented as a step-by-step procedure. The calculation procedure consists of a damaging elastic step followed by a number of damaging viscoelastic steps. The damage variable is adjusted at each step, according to the value gained by the pseudo strain. Exemplary calculations are worked out for two cases of uniaxial and biaxial variable or cyclic loadings. The results show the efficiency of the incremental model. It is worth noticing that the time increment used for the calculations is not necessarily small. As a consequence, precise analysis of damaging time dependent structures can be performed for low calculation cost...|$|E

Because ETFE {{film is a}} kind of polymer materials, it shows both elasto-plastic and visco-elastic characteristics. Using FEM and experimental results of ETFE film, the authors developed the constitutive equation. First to investigate the elasto-plastic characteristics of ETFE, a biaxial tensile test was carried out. The elasto-plastic characteristics are formulated adopting the von Mises criterion under biaxial stresses. FEM analysis of the test of rectangular ETFE cushion under pressure showed the validity in presenting ETFE behaviour based on the proposed constitutive equation. Then to investigate the viscoelastic properties, an incremental formula of the constitutive equation was extended and introduced to FEM analysis. The test showed that uniaxial creep properties can be presented using the proposed constitutive equation. Furthermore, to present biaxial creep properties, the <b>incremental</b> <b>form</b> of the constitutive equation was extended and the confirmation was given for its validityIn this paper, also to investigate temperature dependency of the elasto-plastic characteristic, the following points are focused on: 1.
