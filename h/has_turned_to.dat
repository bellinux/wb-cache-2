5|$|In 1993, Lundgren starred {{opposite}} Kristian Alfonso and George Segal in Joshua Tree, {{directed by}} Academy Award and BAFTA-winning stunt coordinator Vic Armstrong. Lundgren plays Wellman Anthony Santee, a former racecar driver who <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> hauling exotic stolen cars {{with his friend}} Eddie Turner (Ken Foree). One day he is framed by police officer Frank Severance (Segal) {{for the murder of}} a highway patrolman, also killing his friend Eddie. Santee is sent to prison after recovering in a prison hospital, but escapes during transfer and takes a female hostage named Rita Marrick (Alfonso) at a gas station, not suspecting that she's a cop. On the run from the law, involving exotic cars and desert scenery, Santee must prove his innocence and prove Severance guilty of being involved in the car ring and for murder. Much of the film was filmed in the Alabama Hills of the Sierra Nevada and the desert of the Joshua Tree National Park of southeast California.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} causes Katarn {{to distance}} himself from the Force and return to mercenary missions with Jan Ors. In Jedi Outcast, Ors is captured by Desann, a former pupil of Luke Skywalker who <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the Dark Side. Katarn believes Desann to have killed Ors, and so he returns to the Valley of the Jedi in an attempt to reconnect to the Force so as to stop Desann. Eventually, it is revealed that Ors' death is a ruse by Desann {{for the express purpose of}} having Katarn return to the Valley, so Desann may learn of its location. Desann, in league with the Imperial Remnant, uses the power of the Valley to endow his troops with Force power, before using them to launch an attack on the Jedi Academy. However, Katarn defeats Desann and discovers his true path, becoming a tutor at the Academy. In Jedi Academy, Katarn takes on two students: Jaden Korr and Rosh Penin. The protagonist of the game is Jaden, who is dispatched on various peace-keeping missions across the galaxy, sometimes with Katarn, sometimes alone. Jaden eventually encounters a Sith cult led by Tavion (Desann's former apprentice) who plans to restore the Sith to power by using stolen Force energy to resurrect an ancient Sith Lord, Marka Ragnos. After learning that Rosh has betrayed the Jedi and joined Tavion, Jaden may either kill him and turn to the Dark Side or let him live and remain on the Light Side. If Jaden chooses to free Rosh, he ultimately faces and defeats both Tavion and the spirit of Ragnos. If he chooses the Dark Side, he kills Tavion, fights and defeats (but does not kill) Katarn, and then flees with Tavion's staff, which is capable of absorbing the Force. The game ends with Katarn setting out in pursuit of Jaden.|$|E

25|$|After Stoney Creek Bridge {{the line}} {{proceeds}} north-east {{along the northern}} side of the Stoney Creek Gorge, over two timber trestle bridges at 23.39km and 23.78km, plus a single span timber bridge at 23.89km and a single span steel bridge at 24.54km, before entering Tunnel 14 at 24.69km (curve left, 85m). Glacier Rock looms {{to the north of}} the line at this point. The line then passes the site of The Springs Station before cutting alongside The Red Bluff and entering the Barron Gorge. There is a single span steel bridge at 25.49km, and a modern footbridge over the line (Douglas Track) before two timber trestle bridges at 25. km and 25.95km. By this point the line <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the north-west.|$|E
25|$|Act Four {{takes place}} {{three months later}} in the town jail, early in the morning. Tituba, sharing a cell with Sarah Good, has gone insane {{from all of the}} hysteria, hearing voices and now {{actually}} claiming to talk to Satan. Marshal Herrick, depressed at having arrested so many of his neighbors, <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> alcoholism. Many villagers have been charged with witchcraft; most have confessed and been given lengthy prison terms and their property seized by the government; twelve have been hanged; seven more are to be hanged at sunrise for refusing to confess, including John Proctor, Rebecca Nurse and Martha Corey. Giles Corey was tortured to death by pressing as the court tried in vain to extract a plea; by holding out, Giles ensured that his sons would not be disinherited. The village has become dysfunctional with so many people in prison or dead, and with the arrival of news of rebellion against the courts in nearby Andover, whispers abound of an uprising in Salem. Abigail, fearful of the consequences, steals Parris's life savings and disappears on a ship to England with Mercy Lewis.|$|E
500|$|The Gulf Stream (1899), by the American artist Winslow Homer (1836–1910), {{replicates}} {{the composition}} of The Raft of the Medusa with a damaged vessel, ominously surrounded by sharks and threatened by a waterspout. Like Géricault, Homer makes a black man the pivotal figure in the scene, though here he is the vessel's sole occupant. A ship in the distance mirrors the Argus from Géricault's painting. The move from the drama of Romanticism to the new Realism is exemplified by the stoic resignation of Homer's figure. The man's condition, which in earlier works might have been characterised by hope or helplessness, <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> [...] "sullen rage".|$|E

500|$|In the song, Jackson {{tells the}} media to stop {{pressuring}} him and to stop misrepresenting the truth. Jon Pareles of The New York Times observed, [...] "fear <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> aggression. The music has polarized; it's either clipped, choppy and electronic or glossy and sumptuous, only occasionally trying to combine the two. Most of the time, Jackson sounds as if he's singing through clenched teeth, spitting out words in defiance of any and all persecutors". He believed that [...] "Scream" [...] had a similar sound {{to the music of}} Janet's acclaimed Rhythm Nation. It was Michael Jackson's first song that contained the word [...] "fucking" [...] in the lyrics [...] "Stop pressuring me/Stop pressuring me/Stop fucking with me"—which was thought of as an unusual choice for Jackson, considering his appeal with the younger audience. Other songs on HIStory contained words such as kike, shit, and from The Notorious B.I.G., the word [...] "nigga". [...] "Scream" [...] incorporates elements of pop, R, hip-hop, funk and rock.|$|E
500|$|Joe {{accepts the}} job, and sadly leaves his father.

[...] Joe himself is becoming careless due to the distractions; one mistake is caught by his nurse, Emily, who greatly admires the physician Joe could be ("The Gentleman Is a Dope"). [...] Denby congratulates Joe on his skills, both medical and social. [...] The elder doctor has less time for a nurse, Carrie Middleton, who has worked at his hospital for thirty years and once dated him, but who is involved in a labor protest—Denby orders her fired at the request of Lansdale, an influential trustee and soap manufacturer. [...] Charlie, Joe and Emily comment on the frenetic pace of the Chicago world in which they live ("Allegro").|$|E
500|$|... 4chan {{is one of}} the Internet's most trafficked imageboards, {{according}} to the Los Angeles Times. 4chan's Alexa rank is generally around 700, though it has been as high as number 56 at times. It is provided to its users free of charge and consumes a large amount of bandwidth; as a result, its financing has often been problematic. Poole acknowledges that donations alone cannot keep the site online, so he <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> advertising to help make ends meet. However, the explicit content hosted on 4chan has deterred businesses who {{do not want to be}} associated with the site's content. In January 2009, Poole signed a new deal with an advertising company; in February 2009, he was $20,000 in debt and the site was continuing to lose money. The 4chan servers were moved from Texas to California in August 2008, which upgraded the maximum bandwidth throughput of 4chan from 100Mbit/s to 1Gbit/s.|$|E

500|$|Boschman called Lessing's {{narrative}} [...] "ironic" [...] {{because it}} highlights {{the divide between}} who Alice is and who she thinks she is, and her efforts to pretend there is no discrepancy. Alice refuses to acknowledge that her [...] "maternal activities" [...] stem from her desire to win her mother's approval and, believing that her mother has [...] "betrayed and abandoned" [...] her, turns to Jasper {{as a way to}} [...] "continue to sustain her beliefs about herself and the world". Even though Jasper takes advantage of her adoration of him by mistreating her, Alice still clings to him because her self-image [...] "vigorously qualifies her perception of , and thus proliferates the denial and self-deception". The fact that Jasper <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> homosexuality, which Alice dismisses as [...] "his emotional life", [...] "suits her own repressed desires". Kuehn called Alice's obsession with the [...] "hapless" [...] and [...] "repellent" [...] Jasper [...] "just comprehensible", adding that she feels safe with his gayness, even though she has to endure his abuse.|$|E
500|$|The {{depiction}} of King's rape {{and its aftermath}} was compared to similar storylines on other shows. Arrow called it part of the [...] "rape-on-TV trend", linking King's rape with those of Gemma Teller Morrow of FX's crime drama Sons of Anarchy and Naomi Clark of the CW teen drama 90210. According to Arrow, all three characters were [...] "strong, no-nonsense ladies who generally dominate their environments" [...] and did not report their rape. She asked if each show's decision for the victim not to report the rape {{was part of a}} larger cultural belief that [...] "trusts in women who keep their silence". TV Fanatic Steve Marsi called the episode reminiscent of [...] in its presentation of events in real time and emphasis on character reactions. The Michigan Daily Alec Stern called sexual assault [...] "a crutch Shonda Rhimes <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> in all three of her series", writing that the development of King's character was superior to the storyline of Mellie Grant's rape on the ABC drama Scandal.|$|E
500|$|Deborah Wilker from The Day {{commented that}} [...] "Madonna's got an almost rabid energy about her, which she {{maintains}} {{for the duration}} of 90 minutes. In fact she rarely leaves the stage—preferring to change costumes in a phone booth instead. Boy can she change. One minute she's a 50's teenager in a party dress, next she's playing a speak-easy chanteuse. It's almost difficult to believe that a career as young as Madonna's could contain so much popular material that on stage the star can barely get to half of it." [...] Don McLeese from Chicago Sun-Times reviewed the performance at Soldier Field stadium said that [...] "'Shine' seems like a dim possibility for her Soldier Field performance this month, because Madonna invariably takes the stage after dusk <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> dark and brings back the sun again for the two hours that she played." [...] In another review, McCleese commented: [...] " [...] proceeded to show Soldier Field a few moves that would gain Walter Payton some yardage, while putting a whole new twist on the term 'backfield in motion'. The girl really knows how to cause a commotion." [...] Richard Harrington from The Washington Post felt that the tour [...] "would have played better to a full house at the Capital Centre or Merriweather Post Pavilion. But to her credit, Madonna performed last night as if the house was full, and the show is splendid pop theater. Madonna has described it as 'Broadway in a stadium', and with her nonstop dancing, costume changes, mini-dramas and dynamic pacing, it is sort of a 'Liza With an M.'" [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times reviewed the concert at Madison Square Garden in New York and felt that [...] "For all its effort and professionalism, the concert wasn't exactly moving; Madonna had to ask the audience to get up and dance twice. But as shallow, kitschy, pop entertainment—no big messages, no revelations, familiar sounds and images, plenty of catchy tunes—the show was easy to enjoy. [...] The tunes stick to her limited vocal range and usually use short phrases—the better to keep her from running out of breath as she dances across the stage. And her band knocked the songs out with solid precision, recreating the gleaming sound of her records.|$|E
