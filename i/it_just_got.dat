500|$|There {{were other}} factors at play. Balukas admits to having been under great pressure, {{much of it}} self-imposed. After she reached the {{pinnacle}} of her profession, [...] "That’s when I started getting nervous... that’s when I started {{putting a lot of}} pressure on myself." [...] "Playing against the men, I learned to lose,... but [...] hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time." [...] Ultimately Balukas states that her break with the sport [...] "...was a buildup of everything,... A little burnout, a little frustration. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> to a point where I had so much animosity toward the pool world. And that was my out. You know, you're going to fine me? Well, see you later. That was my excuse to finally say I need a break." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} escalated to {{the point}} where death threats were sent to Time-Warner executives, and stockholders threatened {{to pull out of the}} company. Finally, Ice-T decided to remove [...] "Cop Killer" [...] from the album of his own volition, a decision which was met by criticism from other artists who derided Ice-T for [...] "caving in to external pressure." [...] In an interview, Ice-T stated that [...] "I didn't want my band to get pigeon-holed as that's the only reason that record sold. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> outta hand and I was just tired of hearing it. I said, 'fuck it,' I mean they're saying we did it for money, and we didn't. I'd gave the record away, ya know, let's move on, let's get back to real issues, not a record, but the cops that are out there killing people." ...|$|E
500|$|Erotica {{remains the}} most rampantly {{misrepresented}} Madonna album with the biggest backlash of her career. Taraborrelli commented that {{it is unfortunate that}} Erotica has to be historically linked to other less memorable ventures in Madonna's career at this time. However, he quipped that the album should be considered on its own merits, not only as one linked to the other two adult-oriented projects, because it has true value. When asked to name her biggest professional disappointment, Madonna answered, [...] "The fact that my Erotica album was overlooked because of the whole thing with the Sex book. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> lost in all that. I think there's some brilliant songs on it and people didn't give it a chance." [...] Brian McNair observed that Madonna took a financial risk with the album and it was not until Ray of Light (1998) that her record sales recovered to pre-Erotica levels. He further asserted that [...] "what she lost in royalty payments, however, Madonna more than made up for in iconic status and cultural influence." ...|$|E

This is apparently {{the first of many}} Miss Spider iPad apps, which is good for my kid, bad for my credit card." ...|$|R
500|$|The episode also {{continues}} the storyline of Tom and Lynette's separation. Huffman enjoyed her character's storyline, stating: [...] "I'm {{sure there are}} things that they knew the viewers want, which is for Tom and Lynette to get back together. But I do like that it's kind of {{up in the air and}} maybe they won't." [...] Doug Savant commented, [...] "For many years on this show, we knew that Tom and Lynette were the grounding force on the street. They were the couple that most resembled most couples in America. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> to a point after so many years when [...] really wanted to explore the things that made this relationship work by first pulling it apart." [...] Both actors expressed their desire for the couple to reunite by the series' end. Charles Mesure made his debut as new neighbor Ben Faulkner, a self-made contractor and Renee's new love interest. According to Vanessa Williams, [...] "She’s working hard to make it happen and it’s not happening easily for her. And she’s not used to that and that’s where the comedy ensues and it gives her something to pursue." ...|$|E
500|$|Rinder {{told the}} Tampa Bay Times that interrogations [...] "would {{be carried out}} by whoever {{happened}} to be there– 20 people, 30 people, 50 people, all standing up and screaming at you, and ultimately it sort of devolved into physical violence, torture, to extricate these 'confessions' out of people." [...] According to Rinder, the confessions were sometimes dictated by Miscavige, but more usually the inmates of the Hole would force each other to confess: [...] "The 50 people there are all screaming at me, telling me I've got to confess– I've done that, why don't I just admit it? I stole money, I had affairs– people would just literally dream up bullshit and start screaming it out, and then the mob goes crazy: 'Oh yeah, it must have been that!'" [...] Tom De Vocht, who was also in the Hole, recalled that [...] "everybody in that damned room— people are wild and out of control, I punched somebody. Everybody was punched. And screaming and yelling. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> like, 'What {{the hell is going on}} here?'" [...] De Vocht rationalized his own involvement on the grounds of self-defense: [...] "If I don't attack I'm going to be attacked. It's a survival instinct in a weird situation that no one should be in." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{producers}} realised that Paul's behaviour {{had gone}} too far, they considered killing him off. Dennis commented [...] "As an actor, I had the best time because this character just got more evil and more sneaky, more of a cad and a womaniser and it just escalated where {{it got to the}} point where <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> silly. It was ridiculous for the supposed reality of the show." [...] The actor also said that he accepted the producers decision to kill his character off when they explained that they did not know where to take him. However, the show's then executive producer Ric Pellizzeri decided to save the character and redeem him by giving him a brain tumour. Following the removal of the brain tumour, Paul mellowed in his evil ways. Of Paul's dramatic change to his personality, post brain tumour, Dennis compared the differences stating: [...] "He's changed back to where he was 18 odd years ago. What he has become is the same Paul he was back then when he was a very ambitious young entrepreneur with Lassiters and Robinson Corporation. But the difference now is that he is older and wiser and therefore a lot more shrewd and a lot more careful. Post brain tumor, he is no longer evil, more ruthless than evil. Ruthless with a conscience and emotion." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because of the rowdiness of the fans, and {{the fact}} that many {{families}} began sitting in the more affordable bleachers, alcoholic beverages were banned from the bleachers in 2000.

2500|$|In November 2011, R3hab {{released}} a remix of [...] "We Found Love" [...] with a [...] "Halloween" [...] sound. He explained [...] "I made two versions ... one version is more melodic and euphoric. This [...] {{one is more}} dark because the lyrics [...] 'We Found Love' {{can also be seen}} as something dark. 'We are {{at the end of the}} world/ And I still found love.' So from there came the more darker chord progression and the more darker atmosphere, like Dracula is coming to get you. <b>It's</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> a lot of emotion and that worked out great for me." ...|$|R

2500|$|When {{you look}} through the {{financial}} history {{of most of the}} national festivals, the east coast has to subsidise events in Perth ... That's another reason why Big Day Out ticket prices were so high this year, because generally speaking you lose money in Perth. You've got two days to get there, three days to get back, all the trucking, all the production... a hotel room that you would pay $180 in Sydney is $320 a night in Perth in the same hotel chain. The price of hiring everything is ridiculous over there. Combine that will dropping public support for festivals over there and attendance figures and then for all your trouble you get a kicking from the local government and state government. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> to a point where it's become unbearable.|$|E
2500|$|Bruce Johnston {{explains}} that [...] "Brian really worked {{a lot on}} 'God Only Knows', and at one point, {{he had all the}} Beach Boys, Terry Melcher and two of the Rovell sisters [...] on it. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> so overloaded; it was nuts. So he was smart enough to peel it all back, and he held voices back to the bridge, me at the top end, Carl in the middle and Brian on the bottom. At that point, Brian's right move was to get subtler. He had a very tender track here. 'God Only Knows' is a very small masterpiece with a major heartbeat, and he was right to peel everybody back and wind up with the three parts. In fact, it's probably the only well-known Beach Boys track that has just three voices on it." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a UFC 128 post-fight {{interview}} with Ariel Helwani, Evans {{stated that he}} was done training at Jackson's Martial Arts in preparation for his fight with Jon Jones. [...] He then commenced training at Imperial Athletics in Boca Raton, Florida, at a new camp co-founded by Evans and several Brazilian fighters who had concomitantly left American Top Team due to a dispute over management services; these were later joined by some African-American fighters, {{and as a result}} the camp's members became known colloquially as the [...] "Blackzilians," [...] especially on Twitter. Evans gave further insight to MMAWeekly about his leaving Jackson's Submission Fighting, “When you get to a certain point, you really need a lot of time (with the coaches)… make sure you get the one-on-one, and you just need different things,” he explained. “After being at Jackson’s for a while, with so many people at the gym, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> harder and harder for me to get that time." ...|$|E

Because I play a lot like that guy does. My favorite style of drumming is on their records. I definitely model what I do after that. I mean, I don't try to do what they do, but that's just the way I like to play. <b>It's</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> that kind of '90s sound to it.

2500|$|Sharon Knolle of TV Squad stated [...] "From the {{inspired}} 'Tik Tok' musical opening sequence to {{the last}} gag, 'To Surveil With Love' {{ranks as one of}} the best 'Simpsons' episodes in years. I never expected the rest of the episode to live up to that killer opening, but, unbelievably, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> better as it went along." [...] Todd VanDer Werff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- and said [...] "I thought this was a strong episode of The Simpsons. I laughed frequently throughout, I thought both of the major storylines mostly made sense and concluded well, and I enjoyed some of the ways the episode turned satire on its ear. I particularly liked the idea of Lisa conforming by becoming a brunette after everyone made fun of her for being a blonde. Dumb blonde jokes are as old as time itself, but the way the episode turned the whole thing into a sly parody of diversity and conformity was winning." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former {{president}} of Starday Records Don Pierce told director Mark Hall in 1989 another story about Jones after Pappy Daily bailed {{him out of}} the drunk tank and got him a gig in Houston for $2,500. [...] The next day Jones came to Dailey's office broke again. [...] According to Pierce, an irritated Dailey said, [...] "Well, George, you just made $2,500 but I talked to some of the guys you were out partying with and they said you went and flushed it down the toilet." [...] "Pappy, that's a damn lie!" [...] Jones shot back. [...] "It wasn't but $1,200." [...] Jones explained to Country Weekly in his last ever interview two months before his death, [...] "I started on Cokes and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> the best of me.

2500|$|A {{particularly}} brutal session {{took place}} at Satellite Park Studio in Malibu.

[...] Maida even quit once after firing Rock at a group meeting. [...] "For me that was pretty much it. I was pretty much done with the band [...] [...] [...] It was really dark," [...] Maida Noted. Pressure was also coming from the band's management and the record company, who continued to fund the band's sessions. Raine commented, “I think we were at, like, 35 songs, and we all sat in a room and said, ‘Yeah, but there’s only eight that we all like.’ Everyone’s really frustrated.... And I think Bob had even lost perspective at this point. We’re sitting there in this shitty little studio in Malibu, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> a little aggressive and agitated in the room." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{effect the}} {{opposition}} to the war had was that the American soldiers in Vietnam began to side with the opposition and feel remorse for what they were doing. Zinn argues this with an example in which the soldiers in a POW camp formed a peace committee as they wondered who the enemy of the war was, because it certainly was not known among them. The statement of one of the soldiers reads, [...] "Until we got to the first camp, we didn't see a village intact; they were all destroyed. I sat down and put myself in the middle and asked myself: Is this right or wrong? Is it right to destroy villages? Is it right to kill people en masse? After a while <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> to me." [...] Howard Zinn provides that piece of evidence to reiterate how all of this destruction and fighting against an enemy that seems to be unknown has been taking a toll on the soldiers and that they began to sense a feeling of opposition as one effect of the opposition occurring in the United States.|$|E
