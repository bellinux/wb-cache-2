In January 2014, Batista returned to WWE after having left in May 2010, and promptly won the 2014 Royal Rumble match for a slot in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX.

At <b>Elimination</b> Chamber, Randy Orton successfully defended his championship in the <b>Elimination</b> Chamber match to set up Orton versus Batista (who still received a negative fan reaction at <b>Elimination</b> Chamber when he defeated Alberto Del Rio) for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX. Daniel Bryan also participated in the <b>Elimination</b> Chamber match, but was the last wrestler eliminated due to interference by Director of Operations Kane, who was affiliated with the Authority.|$|E
