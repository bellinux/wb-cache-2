25|$|New Zealand had the Chevette {{as well as}} the Isuzu Gemini, while {{neighbouring}} Australia {{had only}} the Isuzu Gemini-based Holden Gemini. The Vauxhall 1,256 OHV (from the Viva and Magnum) was the standard <b>engine</b> <b>unit</b> for all New Zealand Chevette models.|$|E
25|$|The Union-Garratt did {{not enjoy}} {{the success of the}} {{standard}} Garratt. It was soon evident that mechanical stokers could function perfectly across the connection between a Garratt's boiler and <b>engine</b> <b>unit,</b> making the rationale for the Union-Garratt obsolete. The Union-Garratts' extended boiler frames and the position of the bunker and hind water tank upon those frames meant that they suffered from many of the problems which beset the Mallet design; the SAR U and GH classes had much heavier axle-loadings than Garratts of comparable size, weight and power, and the movement of water at the extreme ends of the long main frames generated high wear on the hind pivot between the boiler and <b>engine</b> <b>unit.</b> The Union-Garratt, like the Golwe and Modified Fairlie, was not perpetuated on anything like the scale of the Garratt, and no known examples survive.|$|E
25|$|Once Earth {{received}} {{news of a}} habitable planet, {{the third}} and final part was done. Ten giant passenger discs, each carrying two hundred thousand colonists in stasis, were towed into space. Next came the <b>engine</b> <b>unit,</b> which was linked {{to the front of the}} discs, and then the colony ship was completed and ready to go.|$|E
50|$|The Kitson-Meyer was a {{development}} of the Meyer locomotive. On a Meyer locomotive, the two <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> were mounted close together, usually with the cylinder ends of the <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> facing {{each other at the}} centre of the locomotive. One disadvantage of this design was that the rear <b>engine</b> <b>unit's</b> cylinders were directly beneath the firebox, thereby limiting it in size.|$|R
50|$|On a Garratt locomotive, {{the shared}} boiler and cab are {{carried on a}} cradle frame which is {{suspended}} on pivot centres attached to the frames of the two <b>engine</b> <b>units,</b> which are both free to align itself to the track curvature. To accommodate the pivoting, the steam and exhaust pipes have flexible connections between the <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> and the central cradle.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} and railcars (with a few exceptions) {{used the}} standard steam lorry boilers and <b>engine</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
25|$|The systems used {{to supply}} air are {{compressed}} air systems which push air down a hose to a diving regulator breathing apparatus, are either 12-volt electrical air pumps, gasoline engine powered pumps, or several scuba tank floating systems with airlines to the diver. These hookah diving systems usually limit the hose length to allow less than 7 metres depth. The {{exception is the}} gasoline <b>engine</b> <b>unit,</b> which requires a much higher level of training and topside supervision for safe use.|$|E
25|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was greatly}} improved from the Class NG G11, with trailing wheels added to each <b>engine</b> <b>unit,</b> outside bar frames instead of plate frames, round-topped fireboxes instead of Belpaire fireboxes, and larger dimensions in most respects except the grate area. They were superheated and sported an extremely compact arrangement of Walschaerts valve gear and outside bar frames. The leading wheels were arranged as conventional pony trucks, while the inner carrying wheels were built to the Gölsdorf system which allowed the axle some lateral movement.|$|E
25|$|The N class {{feature a}} {{frame and body}} locally designed, but with {{imported}} Electro-Motive Division technology in the prime mover, generator and control unit, along with locally produced components such as the bogie frames by Bradford Kendall. The class {{was the first in}} the world to use the EMD D43 traction motor, similar to but smaller than that used in the C and G classes. Head end power is provided by a separate <b>engine</b> <b>unit</b> in a special compartment located at the number 1 end of the locomotive behind the electrical cabinet. The 240kW generator provides 415V 3-phase AC power for train lighting, air conditioning and other carriage requirements.|$|E
50|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>units</b> employ four {{direct current}} {{traction}} motors placed inside the bogies, two {{for each one}} of them.|$|R
50|$|The pivot {{bearings}} {{were also}} subject to quite rapid wear since they carried a considerable additional vertical load {{concentrated on the}} centre of the <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> {{as a result of their}} water and coal bunkers which were mounted on the main frame instead of on the <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> like those on the Garratt equivalent. This resulted in increased frequency of maintenance and, as a consequence, increased operating cost.|$|R
5000|$|Their <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> were {{arranged}} with their cylinders facing each other, rather than back-to-back as on most other Garratts.|$|R
25|$|Chapelon's aborted post-war {{locomotive}} replacement programme {{included a}} whole range of 3-cylinder Sauvage compounds. The only one to come into existence was 242A 1, a 4-8-4 prototype rebuilt in 1946 from an unsuccessful 4-8-2 3-cylinder simple. 242A 1 was probably the most important compound locomotive of all time, capable of developing a remarkable 5,300 cylinder horsepower (4,000kW) for an <b>engine</b> <b>unit</b> weighing just 145.6 metric tons. One of the most efficient steam locomotives ever built, coal consumption was just 850 g/hp (1.1 g/W) per hour and water consumption was 6.45 L/hp (8.6 mL/W) per hour at 3,000hp (2,200kW). A typical simple-expansion locomotive could consume approximately double these amounts to generate the same output.|$|E
25|$|The Garratt was, obviously, {{not alone}} {{in the field of}} {{articulated}} locomotives. Aside from the well-known Fairlie and Meyer types, the Garratt had contemporary and similarly-designed competition {{in the form of the}} Union-Garratt, Modified Fairlie and Golwé. Of these, the closest was the Union-Garratt, a type originally conceived owing to the perceived necessity for a rigid connection between a bunker or tender and a firebox fed by a mechanical stoker. Though it could be argued that the NZR G class locomotives were Union-Garratts (having their bunkers mounted on the boiler frames, rather than on the hind <b>engine</b> <b>unit),</b> a more concrete example can be seen in the two South African Railways Union Garratts of classes GH and U.|$|E
25|$|Drivers {{were only}} able to use five engines {{over the course of}} a season in 2014, down from eight in 2013. Drivers who used a sixth engine started the race from the pit lane, as opposed to the ten-place grid penalty handed down for going over the engine quota in {{previous}} season. Drivers were {{only able to}} use five individual components of each power unit element over the course of the season. If a driver went over this quota for any individual element, they incurred a ten-place grid penalty. They would receive a further five-place penalty for going over the five-unit allocation of any other element after the original ten-place penalty was applied in a bid to stop teams changing multiple elements of the <b>engine</b> <b>unit</b> after receiving a grid penalty.|$|E
50|$|During the trials, the {{locomotive}} gave some trouble due to broken plate frames on the <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> {{and it was}} also found that the absence of trailing carrying wheels on the <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> was a disadvantage since it led to excessive flange wear on the coupled wheels. As a result, no. 2140 remained the only representative of its Class. All subsequent Garratt models of the SAR were equipped with trailing Bissel trucks.|$|R
50|$|The 0-6-6-0 wheel {{arrangement}} was used mostly on Mallet locomotives, {{on which the}} <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> were mounted either in tandem or facing each other.|$|R
50|$|Being one of {{the three}} {{electric}} engine sheds in Southern Railway, various major and minor maintenance schedules of electric locomotives are carried out here. It has the sanctioned capacity of 175 <b>engine</b> <b>units.</b> Beyond the operating capacity, this shed houses a total of 221 <b>engine</b> <b>units,</b> including 118 WAP-4 and 85 WAG-7. It also housed a few WAG-6 temporarily. Electric loco Shed, Erode is now housing the largest fleet of WAP-4 in Indian Railways and it caters to many long distance electric trains.|$|R
25|$|K 159: Moorooduc, {{with the}} Mornington Railway. Was plinthed at Hamilton in Western Victoria until that council was {{approached}} by the Mornington railway, looking to swap around a series of locomotive parts in order to restore more engines. In 1997 the engine was transferred to Moorooduc; however the Hamilton City Council wanted to retain a K Class locomotive for display purposes, so the remaining parts from the Mornington swap were reassembled and delivered back to Hamilton in 1998. The true K 159 <b>engine</b> <b>unit</b> is currently used as a supply of spare parts to keep other engines in service, with a long-term intent to restore to operational condition. However, because K 174's tender tank was beyond restoration, this engine at Moorooduc has no tender tank attached to the tender frame. The current list of parts ex 159, 174 and 177 at Moorooduc is listed in the K 174 entry above.|$|E
25|$|K 183: Had been {{in service}} with Steamrail Victoria until 13 October 2002, when this {{locomotive}} {{was involved in}} a serious level crossing accident with a B-double semi-trailer near Benalla, Victoria, derailing after impact. Tragically, three people on the footplate died in the collision. The locomotive was extensively damaged and is currently stored out of service. As of 2013, the locomotive is still receiving insurance money from the accident in which will go towards the future restoration of the steam train to its former glory. Before then, the engine had been plinthed at Yarragon following withdrawal from the Victorian Railways; Yarragon council had selected that engine specifically, believing it to have spent a majority of its life in the region though it is not clear if this is actually correct. In 1982 the <b>engine</b> <b>unit</b> was swapped for K 162, though the tender units remained at Yarragon and Newport respectively. Around 1984, K 183 re-entered service under Steamrail, with the tender formerly attached to K 162, and in a dark blue with gold lining livery. Owned by Victrack.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{development}} continued, and {{a choice}} of engines was offered on all models from March 1963. Villiers modified and developed their [...] 2T twin-cylinder <b>engine</b> <b>unit</b> specifically for Bond and this new engine was designated the 4T. It produced (...) at 5,500rpm and top speed was now said to be [...] "just over" [...] with an average fuel consumption of [...] Saloon models were fitted with an opening boot from April 1964.|$|E
50|$|It is {{equipped}} with many different engines (both gas and Diesel), and comes in both 4x2 and 4x4 versions. Notable improvements over the years were the introduction of Romanian Diesel <b>engines,</b> <b>units</b> equipped with Toyota <b>engines,</b> and <b>units</b> equipped with Romanian-built turbo Diesel engines. The ARO-24s {{are no longer in}} production, as ARO was shut down.|$|R
50|$|Affordability {{is a key}} {{ingredient}} to Caterham Graduates racing. Strict regulations allow only limited modifications {{and work on the}} sealed <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> is limited to specified engine builders.|$|R
50|$|A similar wheel {{arrangement}} {{exists for}} Double Fairlie, Meyer, Kitson-Meyer and Garratt articulated locomotives, but on these types it {{is referred to}} as 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> are pivoting.|$|R
2500|$|The group {{experienced}} {{delays and}} was not fully manned or equipped until March 1944, when it began operations as a Replacement Training Unit (RTU) using single engine Bell P-39 Airacobras despite its designation as a two <b>engine</b> <b>unit.</b> [...] RTUs were oversized units whose mission was to train individual pilots or aircrews. [...] The group's 454th Fighter Squadron did not equip as an operational squadron, but served as an administrative unit that processed fighter pilots before they were assigned to RTUs. [...] This squadron was detached from the group in January 1944.|$|E
2500|$|Mallet {{also worked}} out schemes for {{compounds}} with independent divided drive for HP and LP, some {{with a single}} rigid chassis that were never built, others with a rigid rear chassis on which the HP cylinders were mounted and an articulated LP front <b>engine</b> <b>unit.</b> The latter arrangement was adopted worldwide. The first application {{was a series of}} 600mm gauge locomotives specially built by the Decauville Company for the Paris Exposition of 1889; the design was introduced to the North American railroading in 1900 with B No. 2400, and rapidly became popular there. US practice progressed to the [...] "simple Mallet", which used the same articulated arrangement but eliminated the compounding. Both simple and compound Mallet locomotives lasted to the end of steam.|$|E
2500|$|The Belphégor was a {{cantilever}} mid-wing monoplane. [...] The three part, high {{aspect ratio}} wing was strongly tapered in plan, mid-positioned and {{built around a}} single steel main spar with two auxiliary spars which were wooden in the outer sections. [...] The broad chord wing roots [...] were carefully faired into a near circular fuselage. The ailerons, fitted with tabs, were metal framed but fabric covered. Two part, hydraulically operated camber changing metal slotted flaps were fitted. Its semi-monocoque fuselage was in three sections; the metal forward part contained the [...] Daimler-Benz DB 610A [...] double <b>engine</b> <b>unit,</b> with its circular radiator in the nose and driving a single four blade propeller {{as well as the}} pressurization system. Behind it a tubular Dural structure supported the double skinned cabin and a final, wooden tail section. [...] The tail unit was conventional, with a single tall straight edged, round topped fin and rudder. All the flight controls, whether on the wings or the tail, were both dynamically and aerodynamically balanced. The tail wheel undercarriage had inward retracting main legs.|$|E
5000|$|Custom-made fire <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> {{consisting}} of two modified Toyota Hilux pickup trucks, parked at two different locations for quick access to the tunnel in case of fire on both carriageways.|$|R
50|$|As the {{requirement}} {{was to work}} with a trailer, George Hughes, the L&YR locomotive engineer redesigned the cars. Retaining the articulated concept, the <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> were given a larger locomotive style boiler and four coupled wheels giving a tractive effort of 8080 lbf kN. The carriage bodies seated 56 passengers and had corridor connections. Eighteen <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> and sixteen carriages were built between 1906 and 1911, the two original engines being withdrawn and replaced by ones of the new style in 1909. Twelve trailers, fitted with controls, were built. Being of the articulated type the ride quality was poor.|$|R
5000|$|A Crankshaft {{position}} sensor (in an automobile engine) {{is used to}} provide the angular position of the crankshaft to the <b>Engine</b> control <b>unit.</b> The <b>Engine</b> control <b>unit</b> can then calculate engine speed (angular velocity).|$|R
2500|$|The {{air-cooled}} Villiers 10D [...] engine had a {{unit construction}} three-speed manual gearbox without reverse. This had an output of [...] at 4,400rpm which the manufacturers claimed gave a power-to-weight ratio of [...] per ton unladen. The <b>engine</b> <b>unit</b> sat in an alloy cradle {{ahead of the}} front wheel, together forming part of its support. Both front wheel and engine were sprung {{as part of the}} trailing link front suspension system, which was fitted with a single coil spring and an Andre Hartford friction damper. The rear wheels were rigidly mounted to the body on stub axles with suspension provided by low pressure [...] "balloon" [...] type tyres. Starting was achieved by using a pull handle mounted under the dash panel and connected by cable to a modified kick-start lever on the engine. The steering comprised a system of pulleys and a cable usually referred to as [...] "bobbin and cable", connecting a conventional steering wheel to the front steering unit. The bobbin and cable steering arrangement was replaced by a rack and pinion system in October 1950. Brakes were provided on only the rear wheels; they were conventional drum brakes operated by a system of cables and rods.|$|E
2500|$|The steam {{generated}} in the boiler fills the space above {{the water in the}} partially filled boiler. Its maximum working pressure is limited by spring-loaded safety valves. It is then collected either in a perforated tube fitted above the water level or by a dome that often houses the regulator valve, or throttle, the purpose of which is to control the amount of steam leaving the boiler. The steam then either travels directly along and down a steam pipe to the <b>engine</b> <b>unit</b> or may first pass into the wet header of a superheater, the role of the latter being to improve thermal efficiency and eliminate water droplets suspended in the [...] "saturated steam", the state in which it leaves the boiler. On leaving the superheater, the steam exits the dry header of the superheater and passes down a steam pipe, entering the steam chests adjacent to the cylinders of a reciprocating engine. Inside each steam chest is a sliding valve that distributes the steam via ports that connect the steam chest {{to the ends of the}} cylinder space. The role of the valves is twofold: admission of each fresh dose of steam, and exhaust of the used steam once it has done its work.|$|E
5000|$|They were {{compound}} locomotives, {{with two}} high-pressure cylinders {{on the rear}} <b>engine</b> <b>unit</b> and two larger low-pressure cylinders on the front <b>engine</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} was superheated, with a Belpaire firebox, a plate {{frame and}} Walschaerts valve gear. It was erected in the Durban shops {{and placed in}} trial service on the Natal mainline. During the trials {{it was found that}} the absence of trailing carrying wheels on the <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> was a disadvantage, since it led to excessive flange wear on the driving wheels. As a result, the locomotive remained the only representative of its Class and all subsequent Garratt models of the SAR were equipped with trailing Bissel trucks on their <b>engine</b> <b>units.</b> The locomotive was withdrawn from service in 1938 because of a cracked frame and scrapped.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to K1 at the Welsh Highland Railway, the industrial Beyer-Garratt William Francis, built in 1937, is preserved at the Bressingham Steam Museum. This locomotive had its <b>engine</b> <b>units</b> arranged back-to-back {{in the usual}} Garratt fashion.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{demanding}} electronic parts of an automobile is the <b>engine</b> control <b>unit.</b> <b>Engine</b> controls demand {{one of the highest}} real time deadlines, as the engine itself is a very fast and complex part of the automobile. Of all the electronics in any car the computing power of the <b>engine</b> control <b>unit</b> is the highest, typically a 32-bit processor.|$|R
