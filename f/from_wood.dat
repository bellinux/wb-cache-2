5|$|Coke as fuel: By the 11th century, {{during the}} Song Dynasty (960–1279), {{the demands for}} {{charcoal}} used in the blast and cupola furnaces of the iron industry led to large amounts of deforestation of prime timberland; to avoid excessive deforestation, the Song Chinese began using coke made from bituminous coal as fuel for their metallurgic furnaces instead of charcoal derived <b>from</b> <b>wood.</b>|$|E

5|$|Polistes nests {{can be built}} <b>from</b> <b>wood</b> fiber {{which are}} {{collected}} from posts and plant stems. The fiber is formed into a paper like comb with hexagonal cells.

5|$|Antankarana {{homes are}} {{typically}} raised on stilts above ground level. Young men seeking {{to start a}} family typically leave their father's house and build their own <b>from</b> <b>wood</b> and thatch gathered locally. After marrying a young woman will leave her family's home to move into her husband's house, where she manages the household and assists in planting and harvesting rice. The husband is responsible for earning money for basic necessities and farming the family's land. A young couple typically receives furniture and other essentials as wedding gifts from friends, family and community members. Divorce and remarriage are common in Antankarana society.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} surge in coal use which {{accompanied}} the Industrial Revolution, energy consumption has steadily transitioned <b>from</b> <b>wood</b> and biomass to fossil fuels. The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20thcentury {{in the face of}} the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and petroleum.|$|E

5|$|Caesar's and Guy's Towers are {{residential}} {{and may have}} been inspired by French models (for example Bricquebec). Both towers are machicolated and Caesar's Tower features a unique double parapet. The two towers are also vaulted in stone on every storey. Caesar's Tower contained a grim basement dungeon; according to local legend dating back to at least 1644 it is also known as Poitiers Tower, either because prisoners from the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 may have been imprisoned there, or because the ransoms raised from the battle helped to pay for its construction. The gatehouse features murder holes, two drawbridges, a gate, and portcullises– gates made <b>from</b> <b>wood</b> or metal. The towers of the gatehouse were machicolated.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s various {{internal}} {{changes and}} improvements {{were made to}} the mechanics. In 1969 the hammer tips were changed to neoprene rubber instead of felt, to avoid the excessive need for regular maintenance, while in 1975 harp supports were changed <b>from</b> <b>wood</b> to aluminum. Although this made production cheaper, it changed the resonance of the instrument slightly. In 1977 the power amplifier design was changed from an 80 to a 100-watt model. The Mk II model was introduced in late 1979, which was simply a set of cosmetic changes over the most recent Mk I models. A new 54-note model was added to the range.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a woodcarving. It takes its form <b>from</b> <b>wood</b> (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E

5|$|Following post-storm surveys, it was {{determined}} that most of the severely damaged schools were built improperly and the upper-floors were not designed to bear typhoon-force winds. According to building codes in Thailand, structures are mandated to be able to withstand up to 120kgf/m2 of pressure from winds. In the years following the typhoon, studies by engineers were conducted in the hardest hit regions to determine how to best rebuild structures in the country. With many of the destroyed structures being constructed <b>from</b> <b>wood,</b> reinforced concrete structures were the suggested replacement. The new buildings could last up to 50 years with proper construction; however, sub-standard building would result in a need for repairs within five years.|$|E
5|$|For {{over three}} centuries during the Song Dynasty (960–1279) China {{experienced}} sustained growth {{in per capita}} income and population, structural change in the economy, and increased pace of technological innovation. Movable print, improved seeds for rice and other commercial crops, gunpowder, water-powered mechanical clocks, the use of coal {{as a source of}} fuel for a variety of industries, improved techniques for iron and steel production, pound locks and many other technological innovations transformed the economy. In north China, the main fuel source for ceramic kilns and iron furnaces shifted <b>from</b> <b>wood</b> to coal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century several duck decoys were {{built on the}} moor. These {{consisted}} of {{a pool of water}} leading from which are from one to eight curving, tapering ditches.

Parents donated pots and pans, and a newly hired cook prepared lunches, to be eaten at new tables and benches. The tables and benches were constructed by the custodian and the music teacher <b>from</b> <b>wood</b> of horse stalls formerly on the campus.

5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{occurs in}} all types of woodlands and is catholic in its diet, being capable of extracting seeds from pine cones, insect larvae from inside trees or eggs and chicks of other birds from their nests. It breeds in holes excavated in living or dead trees, unlined apart <b>from</b> <b>wood</b> chips. The typical clutch is four to six glossy white eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs, feed the chicks and keep the nest clean. When the young fledge they are fed by the adults for about ten days, each parent taking responsibility for feeding part of the brood.|$|E
