5|$|Naoi {{is a human}} {{originally}} {{thought to be a}} non-player character (non-human). After he died, Naoi developed hypnotic powers that allow him to control others and cause them to enter a dream-like state. In life, {{he was the son of}} a famous potter. However, it was his twin brother who had the talent in pottery and as a result, Naoi was ignored by everyone. When his brother died, he was made to replace him by his father and was given strict training in pottery. As a result, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> his own life was fake and all he wanted was to be acknowledged for his own existence. He later befriends Otonashi after he acknowledges him and joins the SSS. As acting student council president for a time and self-proclaimed God, Naoi is strict and arrogant, but this is quick to disperse when Otonashi chastises him. He is affectionate to Otonashi, much to the latter's chagrin, and always tries to earn his affection. He uses dual USP 45 handguns.|$|E
25|$|Although {{already an}} {{accomplished}} practitioner, in interview Okabayashi Shōgen stated that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{he had come}} to a technical road block in his training through which he could not pass. He could perform the techniques effectively but not at a speed necessary for them to be employed under the demands of real fighting. His teacher Hisa had become elderly and had suffered a dehabilitating stroke and so was moving to Tokyo to be cared for by his family. Okabayashi decided that he would give up the practise of Daitō-ryū. Hearing of this Hisa encouraged him rather to go study with Sōkaku's son, the current headmaster of the art, Tokimune Takeda, and gave him a letter of recommendation.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to active duty, Hathcock helped establish the Marine Corps Scout Sniper School, at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. Due to his extreme injuries suffered in Vietnam, {{he was in}} nearly constant pain, but he continued to dedicate himself to teaching snipers. In 1975, Hathcock's health began to deteriorate, and {{he was diagnosed with}} multiple sclerosis. He stayed in the Marine Corps, but his health continued to decline. And, just 55 days short of the 20 years that would have made him eligible for regular retirement pay, he received a permanent disability separation. Being medically discharged, he received 100 percent disability pay. He would have received only 50 percent of his final pay grade had he retired after 20 years. He fell into a state of depression when he was forced out of the Marines, because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the service had kicked him out. During this depression, his wife Jo nearly left him but decided to stay. Hathcock eventually picked up the hobby of shark fishing, which helped him overcome his depression.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> again <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she {{had torn}} {{him across the}} breast, dully, finally. He turned aside.|$|R
60|$|Lisle {{was quick}} {{of thought and}} prompt in action, but <b>he</b> {{sometimes}} <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Garnet took his breath away.|$|R
60|$|Harz bowed; but {{for some}} reason <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> annoyed, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been asked to part with {{something}} personal.|$|R
500|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Primus {{was free}} to leave under the Bosman ruling and {{received}} an offer from Luton Town which he accepted. Lennie Lawrence, the manager who bidded for Primus was sacked soon afterwards, however, and the deal was cancelled to the dismay of Primus who said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> [...] " [...] whole world had collapsed". In the aftermath, Pardew put him in contact with Portsmouth manager Tony Pulis and a trial was agreed.|$|E
500|$|Francis Bacon met George Dyer in a Soho pub. According to Bacon [...] "George {{was down}} {{the far end}} of the bar and he came over and said 'You all seem to be having a good time, can I buy you a drink?'" [...] (Francis Bacon quoted in: Michael Peppiat, Francis Bacon: Anatomy of an Enigma, London 2008, p. 259). From that point on, Dyer became devoted to Bacon. He admired his intellect and power and was in awe of his self-confidence. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had found a purpose, as the {{prominent}} artist's companion. Dyer was then about thirty years old and had grown up in the East End of London in a family steeped in crime. He had spent his life drifting between theft, juvenile detention center and jail. Typical of Bacon's taste in men, Dyer was fit, masculine, and not an intellectual.|$|E
500|$|Chrisye {{began work}} on a {{rearrangement}} of Badai Pasti Berlalu in 1999 {{at the request of}} Musica Studios– although he felt that the original album was fine– and once again teamed up with Gutawa. The new album, which retained the title Badai Pasti Berlalu, cost Rp.800 million (US$95,000) to produce and promote, in part owing to the cost of employing an Australian orchestra, the Victorian Philharmonic Orchestra. After its release, the album sold well, breaking even within three months and selling 350,000 copies. The album led to Chrisye's second sold-out solo concert at the Plenary Hall of Jakarta Convention Centre, known as the Badai concert, and he received numerous offers to perform at venues throughout the country. He later told Kompas that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had reached a dead end, having tried all genres available. He continued performing, singing [...] "Indonesia Perkasa" [...] at the opening ceremony of the 15th National Games on 19 June 2000 in Sidoarjo, East Java.|$|E
6000|$|... 'However unconventional,' said Merton, smiling. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> rather <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{were being}} treated like a quack doctor, to whom people (if foolish enough) appeal only as the last desperate resource.|$|R
60|$|Roberts {{shook his}} head. The matter was, to his mind, far too serious to be joked about, and <b>he</b> almost <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were {{acting in a}} treasonable sort of way in aiding to carry out such a project.|$|R
60|$|Merlin {{had become}} livid under the grime on his face. With this ill-kempt sansculotte giant {{in front of}} him, <b>he</b> almost <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were already arraigned before that awful, merciless tribunal, {{to which he had}} dragged so many {{innocent}} victims.|$|R
500|$|Curry {{stated that}} the [...] "first few drafts of [...] focused on a 12-year-old boy and a mother's trial {{of trying to get}} her son out of this boy's clutches, and gradually, it became {{something}} else". In the original script, Claire was [...] "happily married", but Curry chose to have her separated due to her husband's infidelity, so that she could be a [...] "more sympathetic character". Curry was influenced by the real-life story of Mary Kay Letourneau, a teacher who became involved with her underage student, causing her to be convicted for rape charges. Director Rob Cohen revealed that in Curry's draft, the character of Noah was younger, but he made the conscious decision to age him to 19, because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was [...] "not healthy" [...] and that audiences would lose sympathy for the protagonist. Explaining her character, Lopez stated that Claire was feeling [...] "worthless" [...] after her husband cheated, and [...] "People can understand that. They can understand making a mistake in a moment like that." ...|$|E
500|$|In Stanley Kubrick's 1968 {{science fiction}} film , {{astronaut}} David Bowman slowly disassembles {{the mind of}} an artificial intelligence named HAL by sequentially unplugging its memory banks. Carr likened the emotions of despair expressed by HAL as its mind is disassembled to his own, at the time, cognitive difficulties in engaging with long texts. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> someone was [...] "tinkering with [...] brain, remapping the neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory". HAL had also {{been used as a}} metaphor for the [...] "ultimate search engine" [...] in a PBS interview with Google co-founder Sergey Brin as noted in Carr's book The Big Switch, and also Brin's TED talk. Brin was comparing Google's ambitions of building an artificial intelligence to HAL, while dismissing the possibility that a bug like the one that led HAL to murder the occupants of the fictional spacecraft Discovery One could occur in a Google-based artificial intelligence. Carr observed in his essay that throughout history technological advances have often necessitated new metaphors, such as the mechanical clock engendering the simile [...] "like clockwork" [...] and the age of the computer engendering the simile [...] "like computers". Carr concluded his essay with an explanation as to why he believed HAL was an appropriate metaphor for his essay's argument. He observed that HAL showed genuine emotion as his mind was disassembled while, throughout the film, the humans onboard the space station appeared to be automatons, thinking and acting as if they were following the steps of an algorithm. Carr believed that the film's prophetic message was that as individuals increasingly rely on computers for an understanding of their world their intelligence may become more machinelike than human.|$|E
500|$|... "Silver and Gold" [...] {{was written}} {{in support of the}} Artists United Against Apartheid project, which protested the South African apartheid. In 1985, Bono participated in Steven Van Zandt's anti-apartheid Sun City project and spent time with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones. When Richards and Jagger played blues, Bono was embarrassed by his lack of {{familiarity}} with the genre, as most of U2's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid-1970s. Bono realised that U2 [...] "had no tradition", and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they [...] "were from outer space". This inspired him to write the blues-influenced song [...] "Silver and Gold", which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood. It was re-recorded by U2 for the [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] single while the band returned to Dublin during in May 1987 during a break {{between the first and second}} legs of The Joshua Tree Tour. The song was described by Musician as [...] "tough and raw, with Bono in husky and confident voice, underpinned by a sinuous bass line, and with The Edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in blues-based guitar." [...] "Silver and Gold" [...] was played live on The Joshua Tree Tour several times, one performance of which was featured on the band's 1988 album and rockumentary, Rattle and Hum. Both the studio recording and the Sun City versions were later featured on the bonus disc of the 20th anniversary edition of The Joshua Tree. The studio version was also included on the limited edition B-sides bonus disk of the band's first compilation album, The Best of 1980–1990.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} Goddess Shree Mariyamma {{can be traced}} back to nearly about 800 years. As per ancient {{folklore}} and the sayings of ancestors, a person from the 'chulli Gurikara' family, living in the Mogaveeras village of ancient Karnataka, had gone to the ghat area on business visit. While returning home, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that some divine power is following him and <b>he</b> also <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> his body started to shake and shiver <b>as</b> <b>if</b> in a trance known as 'Avesha' meaning Goddess entering a human body and speaking through him. <b>He</b> later <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> God said to him to take her along him to the place where he resides. He then reached Urwa and decided to build a temple to this Goddess.|$|R
60|$|There {{was just}} room for {{him under the}} low cover of the sledge; he hesitated no longer now, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> indeed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> nothing would tear him away from Gilda's side until she was safely home again in their father's arms.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Wentworth looked grave; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> awkwardly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all {{the company}} had come in and found him {{standing}} before the looking-glass. [...] "The Lord made it," [...] he said. [...] "I don't think it is for man to make it over again." ...|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} Oliver Meeker's friends from Indianapolis {{joined the group}} before the party left Iowa. They crossed the Missouri River at the small Mormon {{settlement}} of Kanesville (today Council Bluffs, Iowa). Meeker recounted that, as {{he stood on the}} far side of the Missouri, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had left the United States. As they journeyed westward along the Platte River in Nebraska Territory, there were such large numbers traveling that they were never out of sight of the tens of thousands of other pioneers journeying west that year. Sometimes several wagons advanced side by side. The Meekers chose a slow, steady pace, unlike many who sought to rush along as quickly as possible. Piles of abandoned possessions lined the way, cast aside to lighten loads. [...] As the party went further west, they passed some of those who had hurried past them, and whose wagons had broken down or whose oxen had died as a result of failure to care for them properly. Disease was an ever-present risk; at the present site of Kearney, Nebraska, Oliver Meeker was stricken with illness. This led to a division of the group when most of Oliver's friends, including later Idaho Territory governor David W. Ballard, refused to wait. Oliver recovered after four days, and was one of the lucky ones—his brother later estimated that one in ten of those who took the Trail perished during the journey. Ezra Meeker remembered meeting one wagon train, slowly moving east against the flow of traffic. That group had made it as far as Fort Laramie (today in Wyoming) before losing the last of its menfolk, and the women and children turned back, hoping to regain their homes in the East. [...] He never learned if they made it. According to local historians Bert and Margie Webber, [...] "all of these deaths made a great impression on the young man".|$|E
2500|$|Gable was {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Tarzan in Tarzan the Ape Man, but lost out to Johnny Weissmuller's more imposing physique and superior swimming prowess. However, Gable's unshaven lovemaking with braless Jean Harlow in Red Dust (1932) soon made him MGM's most important male star. After the hit Hold Your Man (1933), MGM recognized the goldmine of the Gable-Harlow pairing, putting them in two more films, China Seas (1935; with Gable and Harlow billed above Wallace Beery) and Wife vs. Secretary (1936) with Myrna Loy and James Stewart. An enormously popular combination, on-screen and off-screen, Gable and Harlow made six films together, the most notable being Red Dust (1932) and Saratoga (1937). Harlow died during production of Saratoga. Ninety percent completed, the remaining scenes were filmed with long shots or the use of doubles like Mary Dees; Gable said that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were [...] "in the arms of a ghost".|$|E
2500|$|Vase with Zinnias and Geraniums (F241) {{reflects}} {{the influence of}} Adolphe Monticelli (1824–1886) in its vivid color and impasto paint. [...] Van Gogh admired, and later collected, Monticelli's work. [...] Van Gogh had been introduced by his brother Theo to Monticelli's still life work with flowers in Paris. [...] He admired Monticelli's use of color as an expansion of Delacroix's theories of color and contrast. [...] Secondly he admired the effect Monticelli created by heavy application of paint called [...] "impasto". It was partially Monticelli, from Marseilles, who inspired Van Gogh's southerly move to Provence in 1888. [...] He felt such kinship for the man, and desire to emulate his style, that {{he wrote in a}} letter to his sister Wil that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were [...] "Monticelli's son or his brother." [...] The first owner in the provenance of this painting is [...] "C.M. van Gogh Gallery, Amsterdam, The Netherlands", which was owned by Van Gogh's uncle and an art dealer, Cornelius Marinus van Gogh (1824–1908).|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} Peggy, {{standing}} on the bottom stair, and back again at the envelope in his hand. His mood was changing with a violence that left him physically weak. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> dazed, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had wakened out of a trance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{tired of}} it," [...] said Pony; {{but when he}} put his mother off that way <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> badly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had told her a lie, and he let Trip come with him and began to train him again the next day.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, on Saturday afternoon, {{at about}} two o'clock, Joe {{received}} a bolt from the blue--a telegram: 'Meet me Belbury Station 6.00 p.m. today. M.S.' He knew at once who M.S. was. His heart melted, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> weak <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had had a}} blow.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2004, NBC {{executive}} Marc Graboff informed Ross of the conversations, and he in turn ran {{the idea}} of waiting four more years to O'Brien, who was immediately receptive. Zucker, along with top late-night executive Rick Ludwin, met with Leno in March at his Burbank studio to discuss the contract extension, and explained the network's stance on handing over the show to O'Brien. While Leno quietly felt both disappointed and befuddled, he noted {{he did not want}} to see himself and O'Brien go through the same dilemma he and Letterman faced twelve years earlier, and agreed to the plans. His only request was that NBC wait to announce O'Brien's installment as host well after the extension, to which the executives agreed. While Leno handled the news professionally (to Zucker's relief), he soon headed to Tonight Show producer Debbie Vickers' office to let her know <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had just been fired. NBC's announcement of the renewal inevitably led to press speculation on O'Brien's fate; to that end, O'Brien and his team went with the charade, peppering interviews with unclear, vague statements on his future. On September 27, 2004, O'Brien officially signed on to become the next host of The Tonight Show; NBC allowed the first comment aside from the press release to come from Leno on that night's show. [...] "'Cause this, you know, this show is like a dynasty,” Leno said. “You hold it, and then you hand it off to the next person. And I don’t want to see all the fighting and all the 'Who’s better?' and nasty things back and forth in the press. So right now, here it is—Conan, it's yours! See you in five years, buddy!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he {{had struck}} her {{directly}} he uttered that last word.|$|E
60|$|With that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were {{rooted to}} the spot and could not move.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> strangely interested. This Min Palmer must {{at least}} be {{different}} from the rest of the Cornerites, if only in the greater force of her wickedness. <b>He</b> almost <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> her sins on the grand scale were less blameworthy than the petty vices of her censorious neighbours.|$|R

6000|$|... "A warrant? What warrant?"

60|$|Mr Wegg replied, with literal exactness, that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{he had had}} a turn.|$|E
60|$|But <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{his blood}} was melting into tears, and he cried in terror and pain.|$|E
60|$|The room {{seemed to}} reel before Jimmy's eyes. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{a friend had}} wounded him in his tenderest feelings. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> some loved one had smitten him {{over the back of}} the head with a sandbag.

It was as if he had found her out in some terrible crime that {{revealed}} unsuspected flaws in her hitherto ideal character.|$|E
6000|$|This mishap made it {{necessary}} to get the dripping infants {{home as soon as}} possible; so the wagons were loaded up, and away they went, <b>as</b> merry <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the mountain air had really been [...] "Oxygenated Sweets not Bitters," [...] as Dr. Alec suggested when Mac said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> jolly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been drinking champagne instead of the current wine that came with a great frosted cake wreathed with sugar roses in Aunt Plenty's hamper of goodies.|$|R
60|$|This {{irruption}} of Nutty Boyd {{into his}} life was an omen. It meant that all was not yet over.
