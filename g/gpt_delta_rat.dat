We propose a model in which in vivo genotoxicity and short-term carcinogenicity assays are integrated with F 344 <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> transgenic <b>rats.</b> Using this model, the genotoxicity of chemicals can be identified in target organs using a shuttle vector l EG 10 that carries reporter genes for mutations; short-term carcinogenicity is determined by the formation of glutathione S-transferase placenta form (GST-P) foci in the liver. To begin validating this system, we examined the genotoxicity and hepatotoxicity of structural isomers of 2, 4 -diaminotoluene (2, 4 -DAT) and 2, 6 -diaminotoluene (2, 6 -DAT).

The tentative protocol for the GPG 46 model was developed {{based on the results}} of dose-response exposure to diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and treatment with phenobarbital over time following DEN ad-ministration. Briefly, <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> <b>rats</b> were exposed to various chemicals for 4 weeks, followed by a partial hepatectomy (PH) to collect samples for an in vivo mutation assay. The mutant frequencies (MFs) of the reporter genes were examined as an indication of tumor initiation. A single intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 10 mg/kg DEN was administered to rats 18 h after the PH to initiate hepatocytes. Tumor-promoting activity was evaluated based on the development of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) -positive foci at week 10. The genotoxic carcinogens 2 -acetylaminofluorene (2 -AAF), 2 -amino- 3 -methylimidazo [4, 5 -f] quinolone (IQ) and safrole (SF), the non-genotoxic carcinogens piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and phenytoin (PHE), the non-carcinogen acetaminophen (APAP) and the genotoxic non-hepatocarcinogen aristolochic acid (AA) were tested to validate the GPG 46 model.

However, there are few data on these particles in mammalian mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. To examine genotoxic effects by C 60, CB and kaolin, an in vitro micronuclei (MN) test was conducted with human lung cancer cell line, A 549 cells. In addition, DNA damage and mutations were analyzed by in vivo assay systems using male C 57 BL/ 6 J or <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> transgenic mice which were intratracheally instilled with single or multiple doses of 0. 2 mg per animal of particles. Results In in vitro genotoxic analysis, increased MN frequencies were observed in A 549 cells treated with C 60, CB and kaolin in a dose-dependent manner. These three nano/microparticles also induced DNA damage in the lungs of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice measured by comet assay. Moreover, single or multiple instillations of C 60 and kaolin, increased either or both of gpt and Spi - mutant frequencies in the lungs of <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> transgenic mice. Mutation spectra analysis showed transversions were predominant, and more than 60 % of the base substitutions occurred at G:C base pairs in the gpt genes.

Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) is a potent genotoxin that induces hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in many animal species and in humans. Whereas adult mice are insensitive to aflatoxin-induced carcinogenesis, mice treated with AFB 1 shortly after birth develop a high incidence of HCC in adulthood. Furthermore, the incidence of HCC in adult male mice treated as infants is much greater than in females, reasons for which are unclear. In this study, treatment with AFB 1 produced similar levels of DNA damage and mutations in the liver of newborn male and female <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> B 6 C 3 F 1 mice. Twenty-four hours after dosing with AFB 1 (6 mg/kg), the highly mutagenic AFB 1 -FAPY adduct was present at twice the level of AFB 1 -N 7 -guanine in liver DNA of males and females. A multiple dose regimen (3 × 2 mg/kg), while delivering the same total dose, resulted in lower AFB 1 adduct levels. Mutation frequencies in the gpt transgene in liver were increased by 20 - to 30 -fold. The most prominent mutations in AFB 1 -treated mice were G:C to T:A transversions and G:C to A:T transitions.

In the present study, we examined genotoxic effects of MGT using mice and revealed that DNA damage analyzed by a comet assay in the lungs of imprinting control region (ICR) mice intratracheally instilled with a single dose of 0. 05 or 0. 2 mg/animal of MGT was approximately two- to three-fold higher than that of vehicle-control animals. Furthermore, in <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> transgenic mice, <b>gpt</b> mutant frequency (MF) in the lungs of the group exposed to four consecutive doses of 0. 2 mg MGT was significantly higher than in the control group. Mutation spectrum analysis showed that base substitutions were predominantly induced by MGT, among which G:C to A:T transition and G:C to T:A transversion were the most significant. To clarify the mechanism of mutation caused by MGT, we analyzed the formation of DNA adducts in the lungs of mice exposed to MGT. DNA was extracted from lungs of mice 3, 24, 72 and 168 h after intratracheal instillation of 0. 2 mg/body of MGT, and digested enzymatically. 8 -Oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (8 -oxodG) and lipid peroxide-related DNA adducts were quantified by stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

In addition to oxidative stress- and inflammation related-DNA adduct formations, inflammatory cell infiltration and focal granulomatous formations were also observed in the lungs of MGT-treated mice.

Point mutations were increased in females infected for 12 mo. The mutation frequency in this group was 1. 6 -fold higher than in uninfected mice of both sexes (P < 0. 05). A:T-to-G:C transitions and G:C-to-T:A transversions were 3. 8 and 2. 0 times, respectively, more frequent in this group than in controls. Both mutations are consistent with DNA damage induced by oxidative stress. No increase in the frequency of deletions was observed. Females had more severe gastric lesions than males at 6 mo postinfection (MPI; P < 0. 05), but this difference was absent at 12 MPI. In all mice, infection significantly increased expression of IFNγ, IL- 17, TNFα, and iNOS at 6 and 12 mo, as well as H. pylori–specific IgG 1 levels at 12 MPI (P < 0. 05) and IgG 2 c levels at 6 and 12 MPI (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 001). At 12 MPI, IgG 2 c levels in infected females were higher than at 6 MPI (P < 0. 05) and also than those in infected males at 12 MPI (P < 0. 05). Intensity of responses was mediated by sex and duration of infection. Lower H. pylori colonization indicated a more robust host response in females than in males.

40|$|Gastric {{cancer is}} the 2 nd leading {{cause of cancer death}} {{worldwide}} and the 4 th most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. Helicobacter pylori infection is the major risk factor of gastric cancer, and as such, this bacterium has been classified as a type 1, or definite, carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. H. pylori infects the gastric mucosa of {{more than half of the}} world's population and promotes gastric carcinogenesis by inducing chronic inflammation. Over decades of persistent H. pylori infection and chronic inflammation, the stomach goes through a well characterized pathological progression involving chronic gastritis, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and ultimately cancer. Interestingly, there are strong gender differences in the development of gastric cancer, as men are twice as likely to develop the disease than women. Given the importance of H. pylori and chronic inflammation in gastric carcinogenesis, this thesis investigated the role of gender in modulating host immune responses to H. pylori. The aims of this thesis explored 1) the effect of gender on H. pylori's ability to induce mutations and 2) the effect of estrogen and the anti-estrogen, Tamoxifen, on H. pyloriinduced gastric cancer. For the first aim, the <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> mouse model, a murine mutational analysis model, was used to study chronic infection with H. pylori. Increased frequency of point mutations was observed in infected female mice at 12 months post infection. These mutations were not observed in infected male mice. Further analysis revealed that H. pylori induced a greater immune response in female mice in this model, as measured by increased severity of gastric lesions, decreased bacterial counts and the higher levels of Th 1 antibodies for H. pylori. The spectra of mutations pointed towards oxidative damage as the underlying cause of induction. This study revealed that gender differences in mutagenesis were mediated by the severity and duration of the immune response. In the second aim, 17 [beta]-estradiol prevented the formation of gastric cancer in the INSGAS mouse model, which develops gastric cancer in a male-predominant manner. Unexpectedly, this study led to the discovery that Tamoxifen may act as an agonist in this model of gastric cancer, as it was able to prevent gastric cancer using mechanisms similar to 17 [beta]- estradiol. Both compounds downregulated pathways associated with cellular movement and cancer. CXCL 1, a murine homolog of IL- 8, was downregulated by treatment at both local and systemic levels, which led to a decreased neutrophilic infiltrate. 17 [beta]-estradiol and Tamoxifen mediated the disruption of a positive feedback loop coupling CXCL 1 secretion with neutrophil recruitment, which dampened the activation of proinflammatory and oncogenic pathways, leading to protection against gastric cancer. In conclusion, these studies provide further insight into the role of gender modulation of host immune response in H. pylori-induced mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. by Alexander Sheh. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Kinase activity copurifies with transcription and DNA-dependent ATPase (dATPase) activities when delta is analyzed by anion- and cation-exchange HPLC as well as by sucrose gradient sedimentation, arguing that delta possesses all three activities. Phosphorylation of the largest subunits of both rat and yeast RNA polymerase II is stimulated by DNA, whereas phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide containing multiple copies of the carboxyl-terminal heptapeptide repeat is not. Although both ATP and GTP appear to function as phosphate donors, GTP is utilized less than 10 % as well as ATP.

To test this hypothesis, the activity of <b>rat</b> <b>Delta</b> 6 -desaturase expressed in COS- 7 cells was investigated. Recombinant Delta 6 -desaturase expression was analysed by Western blot, revealing a single band at 45 kDa. The putative involvement of this enzyme in the Delta 6 -desaturation of C(24 : 5) n- 3 to C(24 : 6) n- 3 was measured by incubating transfected cells with C(22 : 5) n- 3. Whereas both transfected and non-transfected COS- 7 cells were able to synthesize C(24 : 5) n- 3 by elongation of C(22 : 5) n- 3, only cells expressing Delta 6 -desaturase were also able to produce C(24 : 6) n- 3. In addition, Delta 6 -desaturation of [1 -(14) C]C(24 : 5) n- 3 was assayed in vitro in homogenates from COS- 7 cells expressing Delta 6 -desaturase or not, showing that Delta 6 -desaturase catalyses the conversion of C(24 : 5) n- 3 to C(24 : 6) n- 3.

Here we report the sequences of eIF 2 B beta and <b>delta</b> from <b>rat.</b> This paper focuses on sequence similarities between the alpha, beta and delta subunits of mammalian eIF 2 B. Earlier work showed that the amino acid sequences of the corresponding subunits of eIF 2 B in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (GCN 3, GCD 7 and GCD 2) exhibit considerable similarity. We demonstrate that this is also true for the mammalian subunits. Moreover, alignment of the eIF 2 B alpha, beta and delta sequences from mammals and yeast, along with the sequence of the putative eIF 2 B alpha subunit from Caenorhabditis elegans and eIF 2 B delta from Schizosaccharomyces pombe shows {{that a large number of}} residues are identical or conserved between the C-terminal regions of all these sequences. This strong sequence conservation points to the likely functional importance of these residues.

A strand displacement assay was used to show that highly purified preparation of BTF 2 had an adenosine triphosphate-dependent DNA helicase activity, in addition to the previously characterized carboxyl-terminal domain kinase activity. Amino acid sequence analysis of the tryptic digest generated from the 89 -kilodalton subunit of BTF 2 indicated that this polypeptide corresponded to the ERCC- 3 gene product, a presumed helicase implicated in the human DNA excision repair disorders xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome.

50|$|The use of steam, {{the high}} prices for whalebone, and the {{proximity}} of the whaling grounds brought the rise of San Francisco as a dominant whaling port in the 1880s. By 1893 it had thirty-three whaleships, of which twenty-two were steamers.At first, the steamers only cruised during the summer months, but with the discovery of bowheads near the Mackenzie River Delta in 1888-89 by Joe Tuckfield, ships begin to overwinter at Herschel Island. The first to do so was in 1890-91, and by 1894-95 there were fifteen such ships overwintering in the snug little harbor of Pauline Cove. During the peak of the settlement (1894-96) about 1,000 persons went to the island, comprising a polyglot community of Nunatarmiuts (Inuit caribou hunters, originating from the Brooks Range), Kogmullicks (Inuit who inhabited the coastal regions of the Mackenzie River <b>delta),</b> Itkillicks (<b>Rat</b> Indians, from the forested regions 200 miles south), Alaskan and Siberian ships' natives, whaling crews and their families, and beachcombers (the few whalemen whose tour of duty had ended, but chose to stay at the island). Ships continued to overwinter at Herschel into the 20th century, but by that time they focused more on trading with the natives than on whaling. By 1909 there were only three whaleships left in the Arctic fleet, with the last bowhead being killed commercially in 1921.|$|R

Here, we tested whether FA reduces myocardial ischemic dysfunction and postreperfusion injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wistar rats were pretreated with either FA (10 mg/d) or placebo for 1 week and then underwent in vivo transient left coronary artery occlusion for 30 minutes with or without 90 minutes of reperfusion (total n= 131; subgroups used for various analyses). FA (4. 5 x 10 (- 6) mol/L i. c.) pretreatment and global ischemia/reperfusion (30 minutes/ 30 minutes) also were performed in vitro (n= 28). After 30 minutes of ischemia, global function declined more in controls than in FA-pretreated <b>rats</b> (<b>Delta</b> dP/dtmax, - 878 +/- 586 versus - 1956 +/- 351 mm Hg/s placebo; P= 0. 03), and regional thickening was better preserved (37. 3 +/- 5. 3...|$|R
40|$|Delta 9 - {{tetrahydrocannabinol}} (Delta 9 - THC), given orally was {{studied for}} anticonvulsant activity against electroshock seizures, and for anticonvulsant activity {{as well as}} protection from lethality against subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), picrotoxin, and strychnine,and intraperitoneal lidocaine in <b>rats.</b> <b>Delta</b> 9 - THC in a dose-related fashion elevates the threshold for maximal electroshock seizures. A dose of 30 mg/kg of delta 9 - THC provides anticonvulsant activity against maximal PTZ seizures while the same dose does not protect against maximal seizures induced by strychnine or minimal seizures induced by electroshock, PTZ, lidocaine or picrotoxin. Further, delta 9 -THC at 30 mg/kg does not protect against lethality induced {{by any of the}} chemical convulsants used.

40|$|Despite {{widening}} {{interest in}} the possible association between infection/ inflammation and cancer development, knowledge of this issue in relation to oral cancer remains inadequate. This study aimed to determine the susceptibility of Apc-mutant Kyoto Apc <b>Delta</b> (KAD) <b>rats,</b> which are vulnerable to developing inflammation-associated colorectal carcinogenesis, to 4 -nitroquinoline 1 -oxide (4 -NQO) -induced tongue carcinogenesis in order to clarify the role of inflammation in oral cancer. KAD (20 males and 22 females) and F 344 /NS 1 c (22 males and 23 females) rats received drinking water with or without 4 -NQO (20 ppm) for eight weeks. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of the tongue were performed at week 20. Additionally, the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines in the tongue mucosa was determined at week 8. Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) developed in the KAD and F 344 /NS 1 c rats that received 4 -NQO. Regardless of gender, the incidence and multiplicity of tongue SCC were greater in the KAD rats than in the F 344 /NS 1 c rats. In addition, the multiplicity of tongue SCC in the female KAD rats was significantly greater than that observed in the male KAD (p < 0. 01) and female F 344 /NS 1 c rats (p < 0. 05). The levels of inflammation and the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines in the tongue in the 4 -NQO-treated female KAD rats were the highest among the rats given 4 -NQO. These results show that KAD rats, particularly females, are susceptible to 4 -NQO-induced tongue carcinogenesis, suggesting the utility of models employing KAD rats for investigating the pathobiology of oral (tongue) carcinogenesis associated with inflammation...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} vasopressin (VP) -potentiating {{effect of}} chlorpropamide (CPMD), we studied {{the effect of}} CPMD in vivo and in vitro in kidneys and in specific tubule segments of rats with hypothalamic diabetes insipidus, homozygotes of the Brattleboro strain (DI rats). Rats on ad lib. water intake were treated with CPMD (20 mg/ 100 g body wt s. c. daily) for 7 d. While on ad lib. water intake, the urine flow, urine osmolality, urinary excretion of Na +, K +, creatinine, or total solute excretion did not change. However, corticopapillary gradient of solutes was significantly increased in CPMD-treated rats. Higher tissue osmolality was due to significantly increased concentration of Na +, {{and to a lesser}} degree urea, in the medulla and papilla of CPMD-treated rats. Consequently, the osmotic gradient between urine and papillary tissue of CPMD-treated <b>rats</b> (<b>delta</b> = 385 +/- 47 mosM) was significantly (P less than 0. 001) higher compared with controls (delta = 150 +/- 26 mosM). Minimum urine osmolality after water loading was higher in CPMD-treated DI rats than in controls. Oxidation of [14 C]lactate to 14 CO 2 coupled to NaCl cotransport was measured in thick medullary ascending limb of Henle's loop (MAL) microdissected from control and CPMD-treated rats. The rate of 14 CO 2 production was higher (delta + 113 % +/- 20; P less than 0. 01) in CPMD-treated MAL compared with controls, but 14 CO 2 production in the presence of 10 (- 3) M furosemide did not differ between MAL from control and from CPMD-treated rats. These observations suggest that CPMD treatment enhances NaCl transport in MAL. Cyclic AMP metabolism was analyzed in microdissected MAL and in medullary collecting tubule (MCT). MCT from control and from CPMD-treated rats did not differ in the basal or VP-stimulated accumulated of cAMP. The increase in cAMP content elicited by 10 (- 6) M VP in MAL from CPMD-treated <b>rats</b> (<b>delta</b> + 12. 0 +/- 1. 8 fmol cAMP/mm) was significantly (P less than 0. 02) higher compared with MAL from control <b>rats</b> (<b>delta</b> + 5. 1 +/- 1. 0 fmol cAMP/mm). Preincubation of MAL dissected from Sprague-Dawley rats with 10 (- 4) M CPMD in vitro increased cAMP accumulation in the presence of VP, but no such enhancement was found in preincubated MCT. Adenylate cyclase activity, basal or stimulated by VP, 5 'guanylimidodiphosphate, or by NaF, assayed in isotonic medium did not differ between MAL or MCT from control rats and MAL or MCT from CPMD-treated rats. When assayed in hypertonic medium (800 mosM), the adenylate cyclase activity in the presence of 10 (- 6) M VP was significantly higher in MAL of CPMD-treated rats. MAL and MCT from control and CPMD-treated rats did not differ in the activities of cAMP phosphodiesterase. The rate of [(14) C]prostaglandin E 2 by medullary and papillary microsomes was not different between the control and CPMD-treated rats; likewise, {{there was no difference in}} accumulation of immunoreactive prostaglandin E 2 in the medium of in vitro incubated medullary or papillary slices prepared from control and CPMD-treated rats. Based on the findings recounted above, we propose a hypothesis that CPMD administration enhances the antidiuretic effect of VP, primarily by increasing medullary and papillary tonicity dye to increased NaCl reabsorption in MAL. There is no evidence that CPMD sensitizes collecting tubules to the action of VP, at least at the camp-generation step. Therefore, increased antidiuretic response to VP in the kidneys of CPMD-treated DI rats is due to enhanced osmotic driving force for water reabsorption (lumen-to-interstitium osmotic gradient) in collecting tubules, rather than due to increased VP-dependent water permeability of tubular epithelium...|$|R
40|$|The {{isoflavonoid}} genistein, the cyclic triterpene glycyrrhetinic acid, and salicylate induce mitochondrial {{swelling and}} loss of membrane potential (<b>Delta</b> Psi) in <b>rat</b> liver mitochondria (RLM). These effects are Ca(2 +) -dependent and are prevented by cyclosporin A and bongkrekik acid, classic inhibitors of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). This membrane permeabilization is also inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, butylhydroxytoluene, and mannitol. The above-mentioned pro-oxidants also induce an increase in O(2) consumption and H(2) O(2) generation and the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups, glutathione, and pyridine nucleotides. All these observations are indicative of the induction of MPT mediated by oxidative stress. At concentrations similar to those present in the cell, spermine can prevent swelling and Delta Psi collapse, that is, MPT induction. Spermine, by acting as a free radical scavenger, {{in the absence of}} Ca(2 +) inhibits H(2) O(2) production and maintains glutathione and sulfhydryl groups at normal reduced level, so that the critical thiols responsible for pore opening are also consequently prevented from being oxidized. Spermine also protects RLM under conditions of accentuated thiol and glutathione oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation, suggesting that its action takes place by scavenging the hydroxyl radica...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the impact of simulated rat damage on grain yield in irrigated lowland rice in An Giang province, in the Mekong <b>Delta</b> of Vietnam. <b>Rat</b> damage was simulated by making a 45 ° cut {{at the base of}} the rice tillers about 3 - 5 cm above the soil surface. 0 % (control), 5 %, 10 %, 25 % and 50 % of the tillers were removed at the tillering (25 days after sowing, DAS), panicle initiation (43 DAS), flowering (72 DAS) and ripening (87 DAS) stages. The total number of mature tillers, immature tillers and percent filled grains, the weight of 1000 grains and grain yields were recorded. The rice crop completely compensated by increased tillering and yield for tillers damaged up to 50 % at the tillering stage. However, the damage and yield loss were highly variable. The ability of the rice crop to compensate at later stages progressively reduced. The implications for managing rat damage to rice crops are (1) rodent control activities should be applied before 10 % of tillers are damaged at the tillering stage, and (2) a well balanced nitrogen supply during the tillering stage could potentially assist the rice plants to better compensate for rat damage. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

The novel cDNA had a long open reading frame encoding a protein of 380 residues with 59 % identity to the mouse delta receptor and topography consistent with a seven-helix guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor. COS- 1 cells transfected with the coding region of this clone showed high-affinity binding to kappa opioid receptor-selective ligands such as dynorphin A and U- 50, 488 and also nonselective opioid ligands such as bremazocine, ethylketocyclazocine, and naloxone. Not bound at all (or bound with low affinity) were dynorphin A-(2 - 13), enantiomers of naloxone and levophanol [i. e., (+) -naloxone and dextrorphan], and selective mu and delta opioid receptor ligands. Activation of the expressed receptor by kappa receptor agonists led to inhibition of cAMP. Finally, in situ hybridization revealed a mRNA distribution in rat brain that corresponded well to the distribution of binding sites labeled with kappa-selective ligands. These observations indicate that we have cloned a cDNA encoding a rat kappa receptor of the kappa 1 subtype...|$|R

The binding affinity measurements were performed in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines overexpressing the corresponding opioid receptor (mu and kappa opioid receptor were <b>rat,</b> <b>delta</b> opioid receptor were mouse sequence). Additionally we also examined the chronic effect of these compounds on mu, kappa and delta opioid receptor and also nociceptin peptide receptor mediated G-protein activity in [(35) S]GTPgammaS binding assays performed in mouse cortex and striatum membranes. Our results showed that KYNA and KYNA- 1 had no affinity towards any of the three classic opioid receptors. On the other hand the compounds significantly decreased opioid and nociceptin receptor mediated G-protein activity or in some cases enhanced the potency of the activating ligand. Moreover, the alterations were receptor and brain region specific. Accordingly, we conclude that KYNA and KYNA- 1 do not interact directly with the opioid receptors, but more likely alter the receptor functions intracellularly...|$|R

In contrast to the significant difference in the blood pressure of the spontaneously hypertensive <b>rats</b> (<b>delta</b> BP = 74 mm Hg), {{there was no difference in}} the renal alpha 1 -adrenergic receptor density.

40|$|Distribution of kappa opioid receptors was {{examined}} by EM radioautography in sections of guinea pig neostriatum with the selective 125 I-labeled dynorphin analog [D-Pro 10]dynorphin-(1 - 11). Most specifically labeled binding sites were found by probability circle analysis {{to be associated}} with neuronal membrane appositions. Because of limitations in resolution of the method, the radioactive sources could not be ascribed directly to either one of the apposed plasma membranes. Nevertheless, three lines of evidence favored a predominant association of ligand with dendrites of intrinsic striatal neurons: (i) the high frequency with which labeled interfaces implicated a dendrite, (ii) the enrichment of dendro-dendritic interfaces, and (iii) the occurrence of dendritic profiles labeled at several contact points along their plasma membranes. A small proportion of labeled sites was associated with axo-axonic interfaces, which may subserve the kappa opioid-induced regulation of presynaptic dopamine and acetylcholine release documented in guinea pig neostriatum. Although most membrane-associated kappa sites were found at extrasynaptic locations, approximately 23 % were associated with synaptic specializations. This proportion is markedly higher than that previously reported for either mu or <b>delta</b> sites in <b>rat</b> neostriatum.

Although several protocols to induce CRCs have been developed, the incidence and number of CRCs are not much enough for the efficient bioassay. Recently, we established the very efficient system to induce CRCs with a chemically induced-colon carcinogenesis-prone Apc -mutant <b>rat,</b> Kyoto Apc <b>Delta</b> (KAD) <b>rat.</b> Here, we applied the KAD rat to the chemotherapeutic bioassay for CRC and showed the utility of the KAD rat. Methods The KAD rat has been developed by the ENU mutagenesis and carries a homozygous nonsense mutation in the Apc gene (S 2523 X). Male KAD rats were given a single subcutaneous injection of AOM (20 [*]mg/kg body weight) at 5 [*]weeks of age. Starting at 1 [*]week after the AOM injection, they were given 2 % DSS in drinking water for 7 [*]days. Tumor-bearing KAD rats were divided into experimental and control groups on the basis of the number of tumors observed by endoscopy at week 8. The 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) was administrated intravenously a dose of 50 or 75 [*]mg/kg weekly at week 9, 10, and 11. After one-week interval, the 5 -FU was given again at week 13, 14, and 15. At week 16, animals were sacrificed and tumor number and volume were measured macroscopically and microscopically. Results In total 48 tumors were observed in 27 KAD rats with a 100 % incidence at week 8. The maximum tolerated dose for the KAD rat was 50 [*]mg/kg of 5 -FU. Macroscopically, the number or volume of tumors in the 5 -FU treated rats was not significantly different from the control. Microscopically, the number of adenocarcinoma in the 5 -FU treated rats was not significantly different (p Conclusion The use of the AOM/DSS-treated tumor-bearing KAD rats could shorten the experimental period and reduce the number of animals examined in the chemotherapeutic bioassay. The efficient bioassay with the AOM/DSS-treated tumor-bearing KAD rats would promote the development of new anti-tumor drugs and regimens. </p...|$|R
