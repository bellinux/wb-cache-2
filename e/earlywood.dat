5000|$|It's {{difficult}} for oaks to get infected in mid summer - after July 1 - because of reduced sporulation from red oaks and summerwood cell development. Two factors changed this around on July 1, 2011: the trillions of oak wilt spores carried in from upwind and the re-opening of oaks' 2011 <b>earlywood</b> cells. The oak wilt fungus {{is too large}} to fit within the smaller latewood cells, but can move upward through the much larger <b>earlywood</b> cells. This increased the chances of infection to storm damaged oaks 1,000 - 1,000,000 times the usual. Instead of one new infection per 1,500 acres, foresters were seeing one new infection per 10 acres.

[...] In latewood, the two spiral angle regions of cellulose fibrils are not continuous, meaning that there are two independent tracheid structures in “older” trees meeting different mechanical requirements. Moreover, longitudinally oriented fibrils improve tensile strength, whereas the addition of 20° tilted fibrils, exclusive to latewood tracheids, provides stability against compression.|$|E

40|$|<b>Earlywood</b> and {{latewood}} form during {{different parts}} of the growing season and therefore capture climate of distinct time intervals. Here we present a comparison of <b>earlywood</b> and latewood &#x 03 B 4; 18 O in tree rings from the Yulong Snowy Mountains of southwestern China, covering the period from 1902 to 2005. <b>Earlywood</b> and latewood &#x 03 B 4; 18 O exhibit different long-term behaviour obviously during the past century. Climate&#x 2013;response analysis indicates that the dominant parameters for <b>earlywood</b> &#x 03 B 4; 18 O are temperature and relative humidity during {{the early part of the}} monsoon season (May to July); however, for latewood, it is the moisture condition (precipitation and relative humidity) from August to October.

40|$|Summary The {{anatomical}} {{features of}} <b>earlywood</b> vessels of-ten reflect information about past climatic conditions. We ex-amined {{the relationships between}} mean monthly temperature and mean vessel lumen area (MVA) in various categories of <b>earlywood</b> vessels. Subsets of <b>earlywood</b> vessels of chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) were selected from a previously re-ported dataset based on several progressive size-related proce-dures. To include all <b>earlywood</b> vessels, the minimum size considered was 10, 000 µm 2. Changes in the correlations be-tween MVA and the mean air temperature in March are de-scribed and discussed. The results show that not all vessels embody the same information. The MVA of a proportion of the largest <b>earlywood</b> vessels in each annual ring was most closely related to March temperature, whereas MVA of the smallest <b>earlywood</b> vessels was better correlated with June temperature. This difference is probably {{a result of the}} vessels being formed at different times: early spring for the largest <b>earlywood</b> vessels and later in spring for the smallest <b>earlywood</b> vessels. Analyses combining large and small vessels yielded lower correlations between MVA and monthly temperature. The number, size and distribution of vessels can vary greatly from ring to ring. In making year-to-year comparisons, the best information is pro-vided by observations on vessels of contemporaneous onto-genesis. Criteria for the selection and analysis of vessels in the assessment of temperature during the season of wood forma-tion are proposed and discussed...|$|E

30|$|In {{deciduous}} ring-porous hardwoods, three-dimensional {{networks of}} the current year’s <b>earlywood</b> vessels {{play an important role}} in the movement of water. In the present study, we analyzed the formation of <b>earlywood</b> vessels along the main stem and leaf phenology in two deciduous ring-porous hardwoods, Quercus serrata and Robinia pseudoacacia. We introduced a dye in an effort to monitor the timing of initial water conduction through the network {{of the current}} year’s <b>earlywood</b> vessels.

Earlywood/late-wood ratio, trunk water potential (Y) and relative water content (RWC) were used to predict differences in conductivities and vulnerability to embolism. <b>Earlywood</b> has about 11 times the ks of latewood, and up to 90 % of the total ¯ow occurred through the <b>earlywood.</b> Earlywood's vulnerability to embolism fol-lowed the same trend as that of the whole wood, with 50 % loss of conductivity at ± 2. 2 MPa (P 50). Latewood was more vulnerable to embolism than <b>earlywood</b> at high Y, but as Y decreased, the latewood showed very little further embolism, with a P 50 <± 5. 0 MPa. The lowest trunk Y estimated in the ®eld was about ± 1. 4 MPa, indicating that latewood and <b>earlywood</b> in the ®eld experienced about 42 % and 16 % loss of ks, respectively. The higher vulnerability to embolism in latewood than in <b>earlywood</b> at ®eld Y was associated with higher water storage capacity (21. 8 % RWC MPa± 1 versus 4. 1 % RWC MPa± 1, latewood and early-wood, respectively).
