5|$|T-26 mod. 1939 in the Kubinka Tank Museum, Moscow Oblast (Russia): this {{tank with}} pressed turret front {{armoured}} plate is in drivable condition (the GAZ-41 engine from the BRDM-2 {{was installed in}} 2005). The tank has combat damage taken during the Great Patriotic War (many marks from armour-piercing bullets and a welded <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> {{the right side of}} the turret from a 50mm shell).|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} three {{swimming}} holes, known collectively as the Powder <b>Hole,</b> <b>on</b> Big Wapwallopen Creek. As of 2001, these {{have the highest}} injury and death rate of any swimming hole in the area. Between 1986 and 2001, at least three people died at the swimming holes and three others were severely injured.|$|E
5|$|Jennifer's Body is a 2009 supernatural horror black comedy film {{written by}} Diablo Cody and {{directed}} by Karyn Kusama. The film stars Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, Johnny Simmons, and Adam Brody. Fox portrays a demonically possessed high school girl who kills her male classmates, with her best friend striving to stop her. The film premiered at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival and was released in the United States and Canada on September 18, 2009. The title is {{a reference to the}} song of the same name by alternative rock band <b>Hole</b> <b>on</b> their album Live Through This. As a tie-in to the film, Boom! Studios produced a Jennifer's Body graphic novel, released in August 2009.|$|E
50|$|Small {{versions}} of this instrument, called bird flageolets, were also made and were used for teaching birds to sing. These tiny flageolets have, like the French flageolet, four finger <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> the front and two thumb <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> the back.|$|R
50|$|All entries played 36 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> {{the first}} day with all those within 19 strokes of the leader making the cut and playing 36 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> the final day, with the {{additional}} provision that the final day's field had to contain at least 32 professionals.|$|R
50|$|Qualifying {{took place}} on 20-21 June, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> the Eden Course and 18 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> the Old Course; the top 80 and ties qualified. Jock Hutchison led the field on 146; the {{qualifying}} score was 161 and 85 players advanced.|$|R
5|$|To avoid violating Edison's patents, Biograph cameras from 1895 to 1902 used a large-format film {{measuring}} 2-23/32 inches (68mm) wide, with {{an image}} area of 2 × 2½ inches, four times that of Edison's 35mm format. Biograph film was not ready-perforated; the camera itself punched a sprocket <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> {{each side of the}} frame as the film was exposed at 30 frames per second. Sherlock Holmes Baffled ran to 86.56 metres in length, giving the film a running time of 30 seconds (although in practice, due to the hand-cranked gearing of the Mutoscope this would have varied).|$|E
5|$|Vent: A thin tube on {{the near}} end of the cannon {{connecting}} the explosive charge inside with an ignition source outside and often filled with a length of fuse; always located near the breech. Sometimes called the fuse hole or the touch <b>hole.</b> <b>On</b> {{the top of the}} vent {{on the outside of the}} cannon is a flat circular space called the vent field where the charge is lit. If the cannon is bronze, it will often have a vent piece made of copper screwed into the length of the vent.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, a {{powerful}} squall line of thunderstorms with embedded supercells developed across New York and moved northeast through parts of northern New England and Quebec. Particularly hard hit was the Montreal region and its southern suburbs including Longueuil, Châteauguay, Brossard and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Barns were reported damaged and other structures sustained roof and siding damage; {{particularly in the}} Saint-Blaise-sur-Richelieu area where one home was pushed from its foundation. In Sainte-Catherine, the roof of an office was blown into a nearby residence punching a large <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> the back wall. On Montreal's Champlain Bridge, eight tractor trailers were overturned forcing {{the closure of the}} entire bridge in both directions. In addition, a window washing platform tumbled from a high rise building in downtown Montreal. The workers were able to get inside.|$|E

50|$|Qualifying {{took place}} on 9-10 July, and entries played 18 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> the Old Course at Troon Golf Club and 18 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> the Lochgreen Troon Municipal course. A maximum of 120 players qualified; the {{qualifying}} score was 154 and 119 players qualified. Eric Brown of Scotland led the qualifiers with 139, and Palmer was at 143. This was the last Open in which all players had to qualify; in 1963 a system of exemptions for the leading players was introduced. A maximum of 50 players could make the cut to play 36 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> the final day.|$|R
5|$|Rejecting {{this turn}} of events, Rin travels {{back into the}} {{artificial}} world again (this time created by Riki and Rin) and helps Riki overcome his weakness. Afterwards, {{the two of them}} go back to waking up at the crash site. This time, Riki and Rin work together to save everyone at the crash scene. Kyousuke, who sneaked onto the bus (as a third year he was not allowed to go), managed to block the leak <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> the gas tank to delay the explosion, despite his injuries being far greater than anyone else. Everyone in the bus recovers from their injuries, although Kyousuke's recovery takes longer due to extensive injuries. Finally, after Kyousuke returns, he rents a minibus, {{and the members of the}} Little Busters set out for a trip to the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Slavas draft had {{increased}} {{too much to}} allow her to use the dredged channel between Hiiumaa Island and Vormsi (Worms) Island so she was ordered to wait until all the other deep-draft ships had entered the channel and then scuttle herself at the channel entrance. However, the Sailors' Committee organized on the ship after the February Revolution had ordered the engine room abandoned for fear of sinking, and she grounded on a shoal southeast of the channel because {{there was no one to}} obey the captain's order to stop. A number of destroyers evacuated the crew before the rear 12-inch magazine exploded at 11:58. However this was not deemed sufficient and three destroyers were ordered to torpedo her. Only one of their six torpedoes worked and Slava settled on the shallow bottom with a <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> the starboard side near the funnel. She was officially struck off the Navy List on 29 May 1918 by the Soviets and scrapped in 1935 by the Estonians.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise was {{refurbished}} for its space shots, {{with its}} shiny exterior dulled down and extra detail {{added to the}} frame. Compared to the newly built Reliant, the Enterprise was hated by the effects artists and cameramen; it took eight people to mount the model, and a forklift truck to move it. The Reliant, meanwhile, was lighter and had less complex internal wiring. The ships were filmed on a blue screen with special film that does not register the color; the resulting shots could be added to effects shots or other footage. Any reflection of blue on the ship's hull would appear as a <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> the film; the gaps had to be patched frame by frame for the final film. The same camera used to film Star Wars, the Dykstraflex, was used for shots of the Enterprise and other ships.|$|E

5|$|The MOD {{commissioned}} {{a series of}} multi-beam sonar surveys to image the wreck and appraise its condition. The high-resolution sonograms showed Royal Oak to be lying almost upside down with her top works forced into the seabed. The tip of the bow had been blown off by U-47s first torpedo and a gaping <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> the starboard flank {{was the result of}} the triple strike from her second successful salvo. Following several years of delays, Briggs Marine was contracted by the MoD to conduct the task of pumping off the remaining oil. Royal Oaks mid-construction conversion to fuel oil had placed her fuel tanks in unconventional positions, complicating operations. By 2006, all double bottom tanks had been cleared and the task of removing oil from the inner wing tanks with cold cutting equipment began the next year. By 2010, some 1600 tonnes of fuel oil had been removed, and the wreck was declared to be no longer actively releasing oil into Scapa Flow. Operations continue at a reduced pace to tackle the oil known to be remaining (state for 2012).|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} break out of Normandy, the Allied armies {{developed}} a multi-stage operation. It started with a British and Canadian attack along the eastern battle line around Caen in Operation Goodwood on 18 July. The German Army responded by sending a large portion of its armoured reserves to defend. Then, on 25 July thousands of American bombers carpet bombed a 6000-metre <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> the western end of the German lines around Saint-Lô in Operation Cobra, allowing the Americans to push forces through this hole in the German lines. After some initial resistance, the German forces were overwhelmed and the Americans broke through. On 1 August, Lieutenant General George S. Patton was named the commanding officer of the newly recommissioned US Third Army—which included large segments of the soldiers that had broken through the German lines—and with few German reserves behind the front line, the race was on. The Third Army quickly pushed south and then east, meeting very little German resistance. Concurrently, the British and Canadian troops pushed south (Operation Bluecoat) in an attempt to keep the German armour engaged. Under the weight of this British and Canadian attack, the Germans withdrew; the orderly withdrawal eventually collapsed due to lack of fuel.|$|E
