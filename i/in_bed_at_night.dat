500|$|Steiger {{suffered}} from depression {{throughout much of}} his life. He described himself as [...] "incapacitated for about eight years with clinical depression" [...] before his Oscar win for In The Heat of the Night. His career problems from the 1970s onwards were often exacerbated by health issues. He underwent open-heart surgery in 1976 and 1979 and struggled with obesity, though certain roles, such as Napoleon, required him to intentionally gain weight. After the decline of his third marriage in 1979, a deep depression, partly {{a side effect of}} his surgery, during the 1980s negatively affected his career. He became increasingly reclusive during this period, often confining himself to his apartment, watching American football for several hours. He said of the experience: [...] "You begin to lose self-esteem. You don't walk, you don't shave and if no one was watching you'd go to the bathroom right where you were sitting". He would lie <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> thinking [...] "You'll never act again. Why bother? You're no good". Despite these challenges, Steiger continued to act into the 1990s and early 2000s. In one of his final interviews, he stated that there was a stigma wrongfully attached to sufferers of depression and that it was caused by a chemical imbalance, not a mental disease. He commented: [...] "Pain must never be a source of shame. It's a part of life, it's part of humanity." ...|$|E

[...] At home <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> he would acknowledge his reluctance to die and feel ashamed. After the war, he realized he had been taught lies and felt betrayed.

I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could have made me change my mind. When I said to the producers I wanted to go they told me they might have to recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on. I wouldn't want to go back at the moment - but never say never." ...|$|E

We'll miss you a whole lot." [...] However, he also said, [...] "For every (negative) post, there's somebody saying, 'You made my life a lot easier because I now have someone I can relate to on screen'." [...] Gay characters had been portrayed before on television, and at the time the popular sitcom Will & Grace was on the air. Lesbian-themed HBO special If These Walls Could Talk 2 won an Emmy. Twenty-three television shows depicted a gay character of some kind in 2000. However, these other characters were mostly desexualized, none were partnered or shown consistently affectionate towards the same person. Willow and Tara's relationship became the first long-term lesbian relationship on U.S. television. Jane magazine hailed Willow and Tara as a bold representation of gay relationship, remarking that [...] "they hold hands, slow-dance and lay <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> You won't find that kind of normalcy on Will and Grace." [...] Despite Whedon's intentions of not making Buffy about overcoming issues, he said Willow's exploration of her sexuality [...] "turned {{out to be one of}} the most important things we've done on the show".|$|E

He merely accomplishes each lesson as a task to be rid of as quickly as possible and I am sure that no lesson ever again enters his mind until the hours of study and recitation once more arrive. His sole interests seem to be feats of physical prowess and the reading of everything that he can get hold of relative to savage beasts and the lives and customs of uncivilized peoples; but particularly do stories of animals appeal to him.

60|$|Perhaps Philip {{would have}} settled down {{but for the}} {{agreement}} {{that if he did}} not like the work he could leave after a year, and get back half the money paid for his articles. He felt that he was fit for something better than to add up accounts, and it was humiliating that he did so ill something which seemed contemptible. The vulgar scenes with Thompson got on his nerves. In March Watson ended his year at the office and Philip, though he did not care for him, saw him go with regret. The fact that the other clerks disliked them equally, because they belonged to a class a little higher than their own, was a bond of union. When Philip thought that he must spend over four years more with that dreary set of fellows his heart sank. He had expected wonderful things from London and it had given him nothing. He hated it now. He did not know a soul, and {{he had no idea how}} he was to get to know anyone. He was tired of going everywhere by himself. He began to feel that he could not stand much more of such a life.

60|$|When Joseph Finsbury and {{his brother}} Masterman were little lads in white-frilled trousers, their father--a well-to-do {{merchant}} in Cheapside--caused them to join a small but rich tontine of seven-and-thirty lives. A thousand pounds was the entrance fee; and Joseph Finsbury can remember to this day the visit to the lawyer's, where {{the members of the}} tontine--all children like himself--were assembled together, and sat in turn in the big office chair, and signed their names with the assistance of a kind old gentleman in spectacles and Wellington boots. He remembers playing with the children afterwards on the lawn {{at the back of the}} lawyer's house, and a battle-royal that he had with a brother tontiner who had kicked his shins. The sound of war called forth the lawyer from where he was dispensing cake and wine to the assembled parents in the office, and the combatants were separated, and Joseph's spirit (for he was the smaller of the two) commended by the gentleman in the Wellington boots, who vowed he had been just such another at the same age. Joseph wondered to himself if he had worn at that time little Wellingtons and a little bald head, and when, <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> he grew tired of telling himself stories of sea-fights, he used to dress himself up as the old gentleman, and entertain other little boys and girls with cake and wine.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile {{her life}} {{proceeded}} with all outward regularity. She found {{it easy to}} deceive her friends, because it occurred to neither that her frequent absence was not due to the plausible reasons she gave. The lies which at first seemed intolerable now tripped glibly off her tongue. But though they were so natural, she was seized often with a panic of fear lest they should be discovered; and sometimes, suffering agonies of remorse, she would lie <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> and think with utter shame {{of the way she}} was using Arthur. But things had gone too far now, and she must let them take their course. She scarcely knew why her feelings towards him had so completely changed. Oliver Haddo had scarcely mentioned his name and yet had poisoned her mind. The comparison between the two was to Arthur's disadvantage. She thought him a little dull now, and his commonplace way of looking at life contrasted with Haddo's fascinating boldness. She reproached Arthur in her heart because he had never understood what was in her. He narrowed her mind. And gradually she began to hate him because her debt of gratitude was so great. It seemed unfair that he should have done so much for her. He forced her to marry him by his beneficence. Yet Margaret continued to discuss with him the arrangement of their house in Harley Street. It had been her wish to furnish the drawing-room in the style of Louis XV; and together they made long excursions to buy chairs or old pieces of silk with which to cover them. Everything should be perfect in its kind. The date of their marriage was fixed, and all the details were settled. Arthur was ridiculously happy. Margaret made no sign. She did not think of the future, and she spoke of it only to ward off suspicion. She was inwardly convinced now that the marriage would never take place, but what was to prevent it she did not know. She watched Susie and Arthur cunningly. But though she watched in order to conceal her own secret, it was another's that she discovered. Suddenly Margaret became aware that Susie was deeply in love with Arthur Burdon. The discovery was so astounding that at first it seemed absurd.|$|E
6000|$|There {{cannot be}} a {{religion}} without a cultus. We use this term {{for want of}} any other, for its nearest equivalent, worship, suggests a different order of ideas. We mean by it, a set of systematic observances, intended to cultivate and maintain the religious sentiment. Though M. Comte justly appreciates the superior efficacy of acts, in keeping up and strengthening the feeling which prompts them, over any mode whatever of mere expression, he takes pains to organize the latter also with great minuteness. He provides an equivalent both for the private devotions, and for the public ceremonies, of other faiths. The reader will be surprised to learn, that the former consists of prayer. But prayer, as understood by M. Comte, does not mean asking; it is a mere outpouring of feeling; and for this view of it he claims {{the authority of the}} Christian mystics. It is not to be addressed to the Grand Etre, to collective Humanity; though he occasionally carries metaphor so far as to style this a goddess. The honours to collective Humanity are reserved for the public celebrations. Private adoration is to be addressed to it in the persons of worthy individual representatives, who may be either living or dead, but must in all cases be women; for women, being the sexe aimant, represent the best attribute of humanity, that which ought to regulate all human life, nor can Humanity possibly be symbolized in any form but that of a woman. The objects of private adoration are the mother, the wife, and the daughter, representing severally the past, the present, and the future, and calling into active exercise the three social sentiments, veneration, attachment, and kindness. We are to regard them, whether dead or alive, as our guardian angels, [...] "les vrais anges gardiens." [...] If the last two have never existed, or if, in the particular case, any of the three types is too faulty for the office assigned to it, their place may be supplied by some other type of womanly excellence, even by one merely historical. Be the object living or dead, the adoration (as we understand it) is to be addressed only to the idea. The prayer consists of two parts; a commemoration, followed by an effusion. By a commemoration M. Comte means an effort of memory and imagination, summoning up with the utmost possible vividness the image of the object: and every artifice is exhausted to render the image as life-like, as close to the reality, as near an approach to actual hallucination, as is consistent with sanity. This degree of intensity having been, as far as practicable, attained, the effusion follows. Every person should compose his own form of prayer, which should be repeated not mentally only, but orally, and may be added to or varied for sufficient cause, but never arbitrarily. It may be interspersed with passages from the best poets, when they present themselves spontaneously, as giving a felicitous expression to the adorer's own feeling. These observances M. Comte practised to the memory of his Clotilde, and he enjoins them on all true believers. They are to occupy two hours of every day, divided into three parts; at rising, {{in the middle of the}} working hours, and <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> The first, which should be in a kneeling attitude, will commonly be the longest, and the second the shortest. The third is to be extended as nearly as possible to the moment of falling asleep, that its effect may be felt in disciplining even the dreams.|$|E

40|$|Mangroves and {{seagrass}} {{beds are}} important daytime shelter habitats for juvenile Caribbean reef fish species, but {{little is known}} about their relative importance as feeding grounds. In the present study, we tested the degree to which these 2 habitats are used as a feeding ground for 4 nocturnally active fish species on Curacao, Netherlands Antilles. Stable isotope analysis was used as a technique to distinguish between feeding in mangroves and seagrass beds. Individuals of the 4 species which were sheltering during the daytime in permanently inundated fringing mangroves subject to low tidal exchange showed a stable carbon isotope signature indicative of a mixed diet composed of crustaceans from mangroves as well as seagrass beds, with the contribution from mangrove food items lying between 57 and 92 %. However, individuals of the same species sheltering on adjacent (< 50 m distance) seagrass beds during the daytime showed a carbon signature indicative of almost exclusive feeding on seagrass beds. This indicates that 2 different subpopulations probably exist for the 4 species studied: a population of fishes sheltering in mangroves during the daytime and feeding primarily in the mangroves and secondarily <b>in</b> the seagrass <b>beds</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> and a population of fishes of the same species sheltering <b>in</b> adjacent seagrass <b>beds</b> during the daytime and feeding primarily <b>in</b> seagrass <b>beds</b> <b>at</b> <b>night...</b>|$|R
