5000|$|A {{turbidostat}} is {{a continuous}} microbiological culture device, {{similar to a}} chemostat or an auxostat, which has feedback between the turbidity of the culture vessel and the <b>dilution</b> <b>rate.</b> [...] The theoretical relationship between growth in a chemostat and growth in a turbidostat is somewhat complex, {{in part because they}} are similar. A chemostat has a fixed volume and flow rate, and thus a fixed <b>dilution</b> <b>rate.</b> A turbidostat dynamically adjusts the flow rate (and therefore the <b>dilution</b> <b>rate)</b> to make the turbidity constant. At equilibrium, operation of both the chemostat and turbidostat are identical. It is only when classical chemostat assumptions are violated (for instance, out of equilibrium; or the cells are mutating) that a turbidostat is functionally different.

Every changestat always starts as {{a continuous}} cultivation experiment (chemostat, turbidostat), but after reaching steady state, smooth and slow change of an environmental parameter is applied. Two most common changestat techniqies are accelerostat (A-stat) and <b>dilution</b> <b>rate</b> stat (D-stat).In case of A-stat the changing environmental parameter is <b>dilution</b> <b>rate</b> (D, h−1) that causes the increase of specific growth rate (μ, h−1).

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features of chemostats is that microorganisms can be grown in a physiological steady state under constant environmental conditions. In this steady state, growth occurs at a constant specific growth rate and all culture parameters remain constant (culture volume, dissolved oxygen concentration, nutrient and product concentrations, pH, cell density, etc.). In addition, environmental conditions can be controlled by the experimenter. Microorganisms growing in chemostats usually reach a steady state because of a negative feedback between growth rate and nutrient consumption: if a low number of cells are present in the bioreactor, the cells can grow at growth rates higher than the <b>dilution</b> <b>rate</b> as they consume little nutrient so growth is less limited by the addition of limiting nutrient with the inflowing fresh medium. The limiting nutrient is a nutrient essential for growth, present in the medium at a limiting concentration (all other nutrients are usually supplied in surplus). However, the higher the number of cells becomes, the more nutrient is consumed, lowering the concentration of the limiting nutrient. In turn, this will reduce the specific growth rate of the cells which will lead to a {{decline in the number of}} cells as they keep being removed from the system with the outflow. This results in a steady state. Due to the self-regulation, the steady state is stable. This enables the experimenter to control the specific growth rate of the microorganisms by changing the speed of the pump feeding fresh medium into the vessel.|$|E
