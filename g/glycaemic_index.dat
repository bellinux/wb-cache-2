5|$|The low <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> {{treatment}} (LGIT) is {{an attempt}} to achieve the stable blood glucose levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose {{may be one of the}} mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet, which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content. Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat), the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40–60g per day. However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is {{considered among the}} most significant events {{in the history of}} medicine. The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index,</b> the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis.

The before NICE-SUGAR cohort received mIIT (target glycaemic ranges 4. 4 to 7. 0 mmol/l), while the after NICE-SUGAR cohort received CGC (target glycaemic range 7. 1 to 9. 0 mmol/l). A total of 5202 patients were included in the study. With transition from mIIT to CGC, the mean time-weighted glucose increased from 6. 94 mmol/l to 8. 2 mmol/l (P < 0. 0001). A similar increase was observed in other <b>glycaemic</b> <b>indices</b> (mean, highest and lowest glucose values, P < 0. 0001 for all).

The thesis consists of a literature review (Chapter 1), general methods (Chapter 2), four experimental chapters (Chapter 3 -Chapter 6) and general discussion and conclusion (Chapter 7). Chapter 3 presents a pilot study aimed to investigate whether high carbohydrate meals with high and low <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> of foods present within meals developed by using the <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> values from the published <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> tables, produce significant differences in postprandial glucose response. Eight healthy active women consumed prescribed high carbohydrate diets with either high or low <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> in a randomised counterbalanced order. The experimental meals which consisted of breakfast, morning snack and lunch were consumed after an overnight fast. Plasma glucose responses were measured at baseline and every 30 minutes for 300 minutes after baseline. We concluded that high carbohydrate meals with high and low <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> prescribed using the <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> values from the existing <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> tables in the literature produced {{a significant difference in}} postprandial plasma glucose responses. Thus, for further studies high carbohydrate diets with high and low <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> were developed using <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> values from available <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> tables. The aim of Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 was to investigate {{the extent to which the}} <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> of high carbohydrate diets consumed for 5 days reduces the rate of fat oxidation during endurance exercise and exercise capacity during running conducted in the fasted state in men and women. To determine this, 9 healthy physically active men (Chapter 4) and 9 healthy physically active women (Chapter 5) performed three treadmill runs to exhaustion at 65 % max after their habitual diet, after 5 days on a high carbohydrate high <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> diet, and after 5 days on high carbohydrate low <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> diet, in a randomised counterbalanced order. Blood samples for the measurements of glucose, insulin, glycerol and non-esterified fatty acids, and expired air samples for the measurements of the rates of fat and carbohydrate oxidation were obtained at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 minutes and at the point of exhaustion. Running capacity was measured as time to exhaustion and distance covered. It was found that in both men and women, the extent to which high carbohydrate diets consumed for 5 days reduced the rate of fat oxidation during running in the fasted state was not influenced by the <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> of the diet, and that <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> of high carbohydrate diets consumed for 5 days had no impact on running capacity. Chapter 6 aimed to investigate the impact of the consumption of high carbohydrate diets with high and low <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> for 5 days on fasting plasma concentration of lipids, insulin sensitivity and biomarkers for endothelial function (i. e. intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1) in physically active individuals. Fasting blood was collected from 17 healthy individuals on three occasions in a randomised counterbalanced order: after consuming habitual diet, after 5 days on high carbohydrate high <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> diet and after 5 days on high carbohydrate low <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> diet. It was found that the extent to which high carbohydrate diets consumed for 5 days increases fasting plasma concentration of triglyceride and reduces the concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol was not influenced by the <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> of the diets. It was also found that <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> of high carbohydrate diets consumed for 5 days had no impact on insulin sensitivity or on biomarkers of endothelial activation. In conclusion, consideration of the <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> of high carbohydrate diets consumed by physically active healthy men and women for 5 days has no impact on insulin sensitivity and fasting concentration of plasma lipids, it does not influence the rate of fat oxidation induced by high carbohydrate diets during running conducted in the fasted state and has no influence on running capacity.

However, the mechanism behind this lowered insulin demand remains unknown. An improved insulin economy might contribute to the benefits seen in epidemiological studies with whole grain diets on metabolic risk factors and weight regulation.

Methods 12 healthy subjects were given flour based rye products made from endosperm, whole grain or bran, produced with different methods (baking, simulated sour-dough baking and boiling) as breakfasts in random order in a cross-over design. White wheat bread (WWB) was used as a reference. Blood glucose, serum insulin, plasma ghrelin and subjective satiety were measured during 180 minutes. To evaluate the course of post-meal glycaemia, a measure of the glycaemic profile (GP) was introduced defined as the duration for the incremental post-prandial blood glucose response divided with the blood glucose incremental peak (min/mM).

Cellular cholesterol was labeled with tracer [3 H]cholesterol during the incubation with acetylated LDL, and 5 % diluted pooled standard serum or autologous serum was then used to induce cholesterol efflux from the labeled cells for 4 hours. Plasma oxLDL and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were assayed by ELISA. The expression of ABCG 1 was decreased in diabetic patients (p In conclusion, the expression of ABCG 1 in monocytes is reduced in type 2 diabetes and is partly related to serum AGEs concentration. The reduction in ABCG 1 is associated with impairment in cholesterol efflux and may contribute to accelerated foam cell formation in diabetic patients...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: Increased glucose {{excursions}} and postprandial hyperglycaemia {{have been}} suggested as unique risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. Much of the evidence {{is based on a}} single 2 h glucose value after oral glucose tolerance testing in epidemiological studies. We examined the association between various indices of glycaemia measured during everyday activities and metabolic CVD risk factors in the A 1 C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study. METHODS: Participants (268 with type 1 diabetes, 159 with type 2 diabetes) completed 16 weeks of intensive continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). From these data, common indices of postprandial glycaemia, overall hyperglycaemia, glucose variability and HbA₁(c) were derived. The associations between <b>glycaemic</b> <b>indices</b> and known CVD risk factors (lipids, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and blood pressure) were explored in linear regression models. RESULTS: For both diabetes types, the overall strongest associations with CVD risk factors were seen for the measures of average glycaemia (mean blood glucose and HbA₁(c)). Associations between self-monitored postprandial and fasting glucose and CVD risk factors were weaker, but significant. Measurements of blood glucose variability showed non-significant associations. Overall, calculations based on CGM were not more informative than those based on frequent SMBG. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Mean glycaemia and HbA₁(c) show consistent and stronger associations with CVD risk factors than fasting glucose or postprandial glucose levels or measures of glucose variability in patients with diabetes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{elaborate}} a literature recherche on a given theme with focus on analytical methods to estimate the <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> of food. This bachelor thesis {{is divided into three}} main chapters. First chapter describes general characteristics of <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> of foods and influencing factors. In this chapter states the influence of high and low <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> foods on health, wellbeing and glycaemia in humans. Subsequent part of this chapter is dealing with many other factors that influence the absolute amount of glucose in blood in 2 hour interval after meal. Chapter two initiates into conventional and continual methods of glycaemia measurement. It highlights the advantages and limitations of each of these methods. Third, the most extensive chapter is dealing with methods of <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> assessment. This chapter is broken down into two parts. First part specifies clinical methods that are also called in vivo, and the second part is focusing on in vitro methods. Clinical methods require blood glycaemia measurement in healthy volunteers after consuming a test meal. With this method we are able to reliably state the <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> of certain foods. The limiting factor of this method is that it is rather time-consuming and it requires higher financial means. These measurements take place under a strict control, according to guidelines and only with the approval of ethical committee. Analytical methods are based on simulation of human digestion. In vitro methods use hydrolysis index to obtain the <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index.</b> The final values are only an assessment of <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> of given food. Other method that is described is measurement of fast and slowly available glucose and starch in given test foods. It is based on measurement of released glucose from the test food with HPLC method, time incubation and standardized conditions. Last method includes partitioning of a test food, and subsequent HPLC analysis of carbohydrates and sugar alcohols. The HPLC results are processed in artificial neural network to reveal <b>glycaemic</b> <b>index</b> values. The advantages and disadvantages of each mentioned method are stated in conclusion of this work. I compared and contrasted reliability, elaborateness, budget demands of analytical methods with clinical assessment methods...|$|E

40|$|Specific dietary {{patterns}} {{are associated with}} the risk of chronic disease. An in-depth understanding more reflective of lifestyle would be possible when assessing the synergistic effects of both diet and physical activity in pattern analysis. In the present study, we examined the biochemical markers of dysglycaemia and cardiometabolic risk in relation to lifestyle patterns using principal component analysis (PCA). Urban women (n 2800) aged 30 – 45 years were screened for dysglycaemia using cluster sampling from the Colombo Municipal Council area. All the 272 dysglycaemic women detected through screening and 345 randomly selected normoglycaemic women were enrolled. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire and a quantitative FFQ were used to assess physical activity and diet, respect-ively. Anthropometric measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis and biochemical estimations were carried out. Lifestyle patterns were identified based on dietary and physical activity data using exploratory factor analysis. PCA was used for the extraction of factors. A total of three lifestyle patterns were identified. Women who were predominantly physically inactive and consumed snacks and dairy products had the greatest cardiometabolic risk, with a higher likelihood of having unfavourable obesity indices (increased waist circum-ference, fat mass percentage and BMI and decreased fat-free mass percentage), <b>glycaemic</b> <b>indices</b> (increased glycosylated Hb (HbA 1 c) and fasting blood sugar concentrations) and lipid profile (increased total cholesterol/TAG and decreased HDL-cholesterol concentrations) and increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations. For the first time, we report lifestyle patterns and demonstrate the synergisti...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundIrisin, a myokine, {{expressed}} by muscle and adipose tissue, {{has been reported}} to stimulate conversion of white into brown adipose tissue. The beneficial health effects of exercise are thought to be mediated in part, via increased production of irisin. ObjectiveThe primary aim {{of this study was to}} assess the association between plasma irisin levels <b>glycaemic</b> <b>indices</b> in healthy adults. Associations between irisin and lipid levels, CRP and body composition were explored as secondary outcomes. MethodsA cross-sectional sample of forty nine (n =  49) free living healthy males (n =  28) and females (n =  21), between the ages of 18 and 65, with body mass index (BMI) within the healthy range, were recruited. Body weight, height, and body composition measurements were taken. Fasting blood samples were collected for the analysis of glucose, insulin and irisin levels. Insulin resistance score, HOMA-IR, was calculated using fasting blood glucose and insulin values. The relationship between plasma irisin levels and anthropometric measurements, glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR was determined using Spearman's bivariate correlation test. ResultsA significant inverse relationship was found between plasma irisin levels and insulin(r = − 0. 380; P =  0. 007) and HOMA-IR(r = − 0. 362; P =  0. 011). This relation was further strengthened in males when the data was stratified by gender. Circulating irisin levels were positively correlated with HDL-C (r =  0. 39; P =  0. 05) in male participants. Additionally, there was a significant negative correlation between percent body fat (r = − 0. 43, P <  0. 05) and body fat mass (r = − 0. 47, P <  0. 05) and circulating irisin levels in male participants. ConclusionsThis study reports a sex-dependent inverse relationship between plasma irisin levels and insulin resistance in healthy subjects...|$|R
40|$|Background: With {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} diabetes mellitus and colon cancer, {{the number of}} patients suffering from both diseases is growing, and physicians are being faced with complicated treatment decisions. Objective: To investigate the association between diabetes and treatment/course of stage III colon cancer and the association between colon cancer and course of diabetes. Materials and Methods: Additional information was collected from the medical records of all patients with both stage III colon cancer and diabetes (n= 201) and a random sample of stage III colon cancer patients without diabetes (n= 206) {{in the area of the}} population-based Eindhoven Cancer Registry (1998 – 2007). Results: Colon cancer patients without diabetes were more likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy compared with diabetic colon cancer patients (OR 1. 8; 95 % CI 1. 2 – 2. 7). After adjustment for age, this difference was borderline significant (OR 1. 6; 95 % CI 1. 0 – 2. 6). Diabetic patients did not have: significantly more side-effects from surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy; more recurrence from colon cancer; significantly shorter time interval until recurrence; or a poorer disease-free survival or overall survival. Age and withholding of adjuvant chemotherapy were most predictive of all-cause mortality. After colon cancer diagnosis, the dose of antiglycaemic medications was increased in 22 % of diabetic patients, resulting in significantly lower <b>glycaemic</b> <b>indexes</b> than before colon cancer diagnosis. Conclusions: Since diabetic patients did not have more side-effects of adjuvant chemotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy had a positive effect on survival for both patients with and without diabetes, diabetes alone should not be a reason for withholding adjuvant chemotherapy.
