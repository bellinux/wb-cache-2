25|$|Woods {{earned his}} 60th PGA Tour {{victory at the}} BMW Championship by {{shooting}} a course record 63 {{in the final round}} to win by two strokes.

He led the field in most birdies for the tournament, and ranked in the top five in driving accuracy, driving distance, putts per round, putts per green, and greens in regulation. Woods finished his 2007 season with a runaway victory at the Tour Championship to capture his fourth title in his last five starts of the year. He became the only two-time winner of the event, and the champion of the inaugural FedEx Cup. In his 16 starts on Tour in 2007, his adjusted scoring average was 67.79, matching his own record set in 2000. His substantial leads over the second, third, and fourth players were similar in 2000 (1.46 (Phil Mickelson), 1.52 (Ernie Els), 1.66 (<b>David</b> <b>Duval))</b> and 2007 (1.50 (Els), 1.51 (Justin Rose), 1.60 (Steve Stricker)).|$|E

She set or tied a total of 30 LPGA records en route to regaining the Vare Trophy and winning her fourth Player of the Year and Money List titles in 2001.

2500|$|The cut was at 144 (+4) and 73 players {{advanced}} to the weekend. Sixteen-year-old British Amateur Champion Matteo Manassero played with Watson and posted 141 and all but secured the silver medal as the leading amateur. Among those to miss the cut was world number one and pre-tournament favorite Tiger Woods. Going out in the afternoon, his 74 included two double bogeys on holes 10 and 13, and his 145 [...] missed the cut by a stroke. It was his first missed cut at the Open, and only the second missed cut in a major as a professional, after the 2006 U.S. Open. Other notables to miss the cut included Mike Weir (67–78=145), Ben Curtis (65–80=145), <b>David</b> <b>Duval</b> (71–76=147), and Geoff Ogilvy (75–78=153).|$|E
2500|$|By 1996, Greg Norman had {{regained the}} top spot and ended 1996 and 1997 {{narrowly}} ahead of first Tom Lehman, and then Tiger Woods and Ernie Els in the rankings, despite his rivals enjoying major victories in those years while he won none. Lehman, Els and Woods would all briefly become No. 1 during 1997, Lehman for a week – to date, the only player to hold the No. 1 ranking for just one week. In 1996, Colin Montgomerie also led the rankings in total points earned over the two-year period (but never on average points per event); in 1997 Els was top of a similar [...] "total points" [...] list. Those were the last occasions on which a player led on [...] "total" [...] points but not average points until 2016, when Dustin Johnson similarly had more points in total than the world number one Jason Day. Woods then finished 1998 narrowly ahead of Mark O'Meara even though the latter won two major titles that year while Woods won just once on the PGA Tour.
