The trend reversion effect is absent when a decline in <b>business</b> <b>investment</b> is associated with a banking crisis. As a consequence, normal recessions do not have significant permanent effects on the level of <b>business</b> <b>investment,</b> whereas banking crises have large and significant permanent effects.
