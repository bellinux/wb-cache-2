The color distribution in the image regions surrounding the annotation area determines the colors that make a good choice – i. e. capture a viewer’s attention, while remaining legible.

This tool works like a ―Magic Marker ‖ giving users the power to automatically choose a good annotation color, which can be varied based on their personal preferences...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to create a}} method for {{designing}} a scholarly journal by managing all design and print aspects of a Volume II, student produced, journal. The journal, Paideia, included student research papers and alumni successes in the workplace from California Polytechnic State University’s Political Science Department. Responsibilities included <b>inserting</b> <b>text</b> and photos from the Political Science committee, and making a cohesive layout and design with all elements given. Since a new volume of the journal will be assembled each year, a style guide was also produced alongside the journal, for future students to refer to when producing a new volume. The style guide ensures a cohesive brand for Paideia in the future years, as there will be new designers assigned to the journal each year. In addition, finding the best printing solution for Paideia, and obtaining price estimates for various quantities was important in terms of budget...|$|E
40|$|The study {{presented}} in this work is a first effort at real-time speech translation of TED talks, a compendium of public talks with different speakers addressing a variety of topics. We address the goal of achieving a system that balances translation accuracy and latency. In order to improve ASR performance for our diverse data set, adaptation techniques such as constrained model adaptation and vocal tract length normalization {{are found to be}} useful. In order to improve machine translation (MT) performance, techniques that could be employed in real-time such as monotonic and partial translation retention are found to be of use. We also experiment with <b>inserting</b> <b>text</b> segmenters of various types between ASR and MT in a series of real-time translation experiments. Among other results, our experiments demonstrate that a good segmentation is useful, and a novel conjunction-based segmentation strategy improves translation quality nearly as much as other strategies such as comma-based segmentation. It was also found to be important to synchronize various pipeline components in order to minimize latency. ...|$|E

40|$|Education is {{becoming}} {{a key factor in}} our everyday personal and professional life. For efficient and effective education we need a fast and high-quality information transfer, which is made possible by the World Wide Web. Therefore, the schools offer e-education or e-learning through the use of electronic media via network. Quality of e-resource is a very important factor for effective e-learning. The diploma work deals with the new web standard HTML 5. Initially, it presents the history and development of the World Wide Web, followed by a comparison between HTML 4 and HTML 5 standards. Afterwards, our focus is dedicated to the new standard and the innovations it brings. The use of the new badges is described and supported with some examples for each individual use. The badge canvas is the main part of diploma work study. The canvas and the possibilities of its use are explained in details – from drawing static elements to inserting and creating animations. Using the new web standard HTML 5 and badges we developed an e-teaching material which is intended for teachers of Design and Technology (DT). We presented the theme "Mechanical properties of wood-based materials. " in the interactive animation. We found that the animation is suitable for presentation in elementary school, because it was flexible. Other animations can also be presented to the students for the sake of curiosity or for {{a better understanding of the}} concept of stress. Use of animation contributes to a faster and more comprehensive learning of materials, especially at higher cognitive levels. Although the animation proved to be good, from assessment of its individual characteristics, improvements are always welcome. Teachers are not yet familiar with the new standard, but are willing to educate themselves about it and use it in their work. We also received the feedback that HTML 5 is suitable for making animations in elementary school. HTML 5 and badge have demonstrated selection capability. It allows the insertion of video and audio material, <b>inserting</b> <b>text</b> and creating animations. It contains all the characteristics needed to enable teachers to create e-learning materials. With the introduction of the new standard we want DT teachers to be aware of new technology, which they can use in their teaching. For online resources, it is important that the material is available and can be downloaded by the end user to a computer using Internet technologies. Sometimes, web plug-ins become obsolete, leading to difficulties in playing or obtaining e-resources. HTML 5 is a solution that can adequately replace web plug-ins and enable easier, faster and more efficient communication with students through virtual classrooms via e-teaching materials. ...|$|E
