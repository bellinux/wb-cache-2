Heavy glaciated during the Pleistocene period, glaciokarstic morphology dominates the higher portions of the mountain. Outstanding for intense precipitation averaging 5000mm/a (maxima >8000mm/a), Mt.

In a number of uses, one end of the hook is pointed, so that this end can pierce another material, which is then held by the curved or <b>indented</b> <b>portion.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} contour method determines {{one component}} of residual stress over the cross section of a part. The part is cut into two, the contour (topographic shape) of the exposed surface is measured, and Bueckner’s superposition principle is analytically applied to calculate stresses. In this paper, the contour method is extended to the measurement of multiple residual-stress components by making multiple cuts with subsequent applications of superposition. The theory and limitations are described. The theory is experimentally tested on a 316 L stainless steel disk with residual stresses induced by plastically <b>indenting</b> the central <b>portion</b> of the disk. The multiple-cut contour method results agree very well with independent measurements using neutron diffraction and with a computational, finite-element model of the indentation process...|$|R

The stress results are validated against independent measurements using neutron diffraction. The theory has implications beyond just multiple cuts. The contour method measurements and calculations for the first cut reveal how the residual stresses have changed throughout the part. Subsequent measurements of partially relaxed stresses by other techniques, such as laboratory x-rays, hole drilling, or neutron or synchrotron diffraction, can be superimposed {{back to the original}} state of the body...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The {{effects of}} ethanol {{exposure}} on synaptic structure were investigated in {{the nucleus of}} solitary tract (NST) in rats, using the horse-radish peroxidase (HRP) method. Methods: Eight-week-old experimental rats were allowed free access to a liquid diet containing ethanol for 3 weeks, while controls were given an isocaloric diet. Some of the control and experimental animals were given an injection of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated with HRP (WGA-HRP) into the vagus nerve {{toward the end of}} the treatment period. After the treatment, the neuropil region of the NST was examined under an electron microscope. Results: We observed that a few terminals were characterized by deep indentation of axodendritic membranes into the post-synaptic neurons. This appeared to be similar to that commonly seen in exocrine glands. Interestingly, the <b>indented</b> <b>portion</b> often contained various sizes of vacuoles and flattened cisternae. HRP-reaction product (RP) transported to terminals was recognized easily as an electron-dense lysosomal substance when lead citrate staining was omitted. Terminals containing HRP-RP also revealed quite a similar structure with indentation of axodendritic membranes as described earlier. The results are considered to confirm that terminals forming ‘apocrine-like structures’ observed in the ethanol-fed animals with no injection of WGA-HRP originate from afferent fibers of the vagus nerve. Conclusion: The present study suggests the possibility that the alteration of the synaptic structure induced by ethanol exposure can lead to the neuronal transcytosis of materials including proteins which is different from the normal vesicular exocytosis involved in chemical synaptic transmission...|$|E
