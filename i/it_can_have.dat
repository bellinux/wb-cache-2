5|$|Mephedrone {{is a white}} substance. It is sold most {{commonly}} as crystals or a powder, {{but also in the}} form of capsules or pills. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a distinctive odour, reported to range from a synthetic fishy smell to the smell of vanilla and bleach, stale urine, or electric circuit boards.|$|E

5|$|The Bates {{method has}} been criticized not only {{because there is no}} good {{evidence}} it works, but also because <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it: they might damage their eyes through overexposure of their eyes to sunlight, put themselves and others at risk by not wearing their corrective lenses while driving, or neglect conventional eye care, possibly allowing serious conditions to develop.|$|E

25|$|Hemolysis is {{the general}} term for {{excessive}} breakdown of red blood cells. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> several causes and can result in hemolytic anemia.|$|E
25|$|Hexokinase II/B {{constitutes}} the principal regulated isoform in many cell types and is increased in many cancers. It is the hexokinase found in muscle and heart. Hexokinase II is also {{located at the}} mitochondria outer membrane so <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> direct access to ATP.|$|E
25|$|It {{may also}} alter the {{effectiveness}} of combined oral contraceptive pills because of {{its effect on the}} gut flora. Erythromycin is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 system, which means <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a rapid effect on levels of other drugs metabolised by this system, e.g., warfarin.|$|E

25|$|Olanzapine is used therapeutically {{to treat}} serious mental illness. Occasionally <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> the {{opposite}} effect and provoke serious paradoxical reactions in a small subgroup of people, causing unusual changes in personality, thoughts or behavior; hallucinations and excessive thoughts about suicide have also been linked to olanzapine use.|$|E
25|$|Anyone {{involved}} in {{education should be}} concerned about how overemphasis on the SAT is distorting educational priorities and practices, how the test is perceived by many as unfair, and how <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a devastating impact on the self-esteem and aspirations of young students. There is widespread agreement that overemphasis on the SAT harms American education.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} or acute pancreatic necrosis is {{a sudden}} {{inflammation of the}} pancreas. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> severe complications and high mortality despite treatment. While mild cases are often successfully treated with conservative measures, such as fasting and aggressive intravenous fluid rehydration, severe cases may require admission to {{the intensive care unit}} or even surgery to deal with complications of the disease process.|$|E

25|$|Thus Bohr's {{assumption}} that angular momentum is quantised means that an electron can only inhabit certain orbits around the nucleus, and that <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> only certain energies. A consequence of these constraints {{is that the}} electron will not crash into the nucleus: it cannot continuously emit energy, and it cannot come closer to the nucleus than a0 (the Bohr radius).|$|E
25|$|Subjective {{tinnitus}} is {{the most}} frequent type of tinnitus. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> many possible causes, but most commonly it results from hearing loss. A frequent cause of subjective tinnitus is noise exposure that damages hair cells in the inner ear. Subjective tinnitus can only be heard by the affected person and is caused by otological and / or neurological conditions, including those triggered by infections or drugs.|$|E
25|$|The {{album is}} the first without {{founding}} bassist Mark McClelland and represents a step forward for the band. Simpson feels that the album is more confident that its predecessor, as the band pushed themselves {{more than ever before}} during its sessions, and had a better understanding of music. According to him, the album title does not mean anything specific and that <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> its own meaning to different people.|$|E

25|$|Elevated nitrate {{levels in}} {{groundwater}} {{can be caused}} by on-site sanitation, sewage sludge disposal and agricultural activities. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> therefore <b>have</b> an urban or agricultural origin.|$|R
25|$|Between {{two phases}} in {{equilibrium}} {{there is a}} narrow region where the properties are not that of either phase. Although this region may be very thin, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> significant and easily observable effects, such as causing a liquid to exhibit surface tension. In mixtures, some components may preferentially move toward the interface. In terms of modeling, describing, or understanding {{the behavior of a}} particular system, it may be efficacious to treat the interfacial region as a separate phase.|$|E
25|$|The EM rash {{associated}} with early infection {{is found in}} about 70–80% of people infected. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a range of appearances including the classic target bull's-eye lesion and nontarget appearing lesions. The 20–30% without the EM and the nontarget lesions can often cause misidentification of Lyme disease. Affected individuals can also experience flu-like symptoms, such as headache, muscle soreness, fever, and malaise. Lyme disease can progress to later stages even in {{people who do not}} develop a rash.|$|E
25|$|Unisexuality {{occurs when}} a species is all-male or all-female. Unisexuality occurs in some fish species, and can take complex forms. Squalius alburnoides, a minnow found in several river basins in Portugal and Spain, {{appears to be an}} all-male species. The {{existence}} of this species illustrates the potential complexity of mating systems in fish. The species originated as a hybrid between two species, and is diploid, but not hermaphroditic. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> triploid and tetraploid forms, including all-female forms that reproduce mainly through hybridogenesis.|$|E

5000|$|Ready-made, {{pre-cooked rice}} pudding sold in tin cans or pots is very widely {{available}} in most supermarkets and shops. Because <b>it</b> is <b>canned,</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a very long shelf life. The most popular brand is Ambrosia.|$|R
25|$|The {{suggested}} range {{given by}} enologists varies from 150mg/l YAN to 400mg of nitrogen per liter. Some {{studies have shown}} that maximum fermentation rates can be achieved with YAN in the 400 to 500mg N/L range. However, not all winemakers will want to have a fermentation going at maximum rate (in terms of yeast biomass, temperature and speed) due to the impact that <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> on other sensory aspects of the wine such as aroma development and fruit retention.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> {{more than}} a passing {{similarity}} to serfdom or indenture, particularly where associated with large debts at a plantation store that effectively tie down the workers and their family to the land. It has therefore been seen as an issue of land reform in contexts such as the Mexican Revolution. However, Nyambara states that Eurocentric historiographical devices such as 'feudalism' or 'slavery' often qualified by weak prefixes like 'semi-' or 'quasi-' are not helpful in understanding the antecedents and functions of sharecropping in Africa.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation along any {{portion of}} the GI tract can lead to colic. This leads to pain and {{possibly}} stasis of peristalsis (Ileus), which can cause excessive accumulation of fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. This is a functional rather than mechanical blockage of the intestine, but like the mechanical blockage seen with simple obstructions, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> serious effects including severe dehydration. Inflammation of the bowel may lead to increased permeability and subsequent endotoxemia. The underlying cause of inflammation {{may be due to}} infection, toxin, or trauma, and may require special treatment in order to resolve the colic.|$|E
