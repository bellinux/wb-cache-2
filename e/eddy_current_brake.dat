25|$|The disc is {{acted upon}} by {{two sets of}} coils, which form, in effect, a two phase {{induction}} motor. One coil is connected {{in such a way}} that it produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the voltage and the other produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the current. The field of the voltage coil is delayed by 90 degrees, due to the coil's inductive nature, and calibrated using a lag coil. This produces eddy currents in the disc and the effect is such that a force is exerted on the disc in proportion to the product of the instantaneous current, voltage and phase angle (power factor) between them. A permanent magnet acts as an <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>brake,</b> exerting an opposing force proportional to the speed of rotation of the disc. The equilibrium between these two opposing forces results in the disc rotating at a speed proportional to the power or rate of energy usage. The disc drives a register mechanism which counts revolutions, much like the odometer in a car, in order to render a measurement of the total energy used.|$|E

Performance is evaluated by measuring {{the movement of the}} manipulandum with an accelerometer while modulating the viscous force at high frequency. Key advantages of this technique include guaranteed passivity of the haptic synthesis, accurate results from the linear dynamics of these brakes, and elimination of the need to estimate or observe velocity...|$|R

5000|$|The linear <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>brake</b> {{consists}} of a magnetic yoke with electrical coils positioned along the rail, which are being magnetized alternating as south and north magnetic poles. This magnet does not touch the rail, but is held at a constant small distance from the rail of approximately 7 mm (the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>brake</b> {{should not be confused}} with another device, the magnetic brake, in wide use in railways, which exerts its braking force by friction of a brake shoe with the rail). It works the same as a disk <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>brake,</b> by inducing closed loops of eddy current in the conductive rail, which generate counter magnetic fields which oppose the motion of the train.|$|E

5000|$|The {{braking force}} of an <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>brake</b> is exactly {{proportional}} to the velocity V, so it acts similar to viscous friction in a liquid. The braking force decreases as the velocity decreases. When the conductive sheet is stationary, the magnetic field through each {{part of it is}} constant, not changing with time, so no eddy currents are induced, and there is no force between the magnet and the conductor. Thus an <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>brake</b> has no holding force.|$|E

We also show that a modulation rate of approximately 250 Hz can easily be achieved with off the shelf components. A method for decoupling the damping at the end effector is discussed. We discuss the results from haptic experiments for rendering viscosity, virtual walls and virtual friction.

50|$|In Belgium, {{the train}} was {{licensed}} in 2002 to run on the classic 3 kV DC lines with speeds up to 160 km/h and, from December 2004, also on the new 25 kV AC high-speed lines, but initially limited to 250 km/h instead of 300 km/h. Problems with flying gravel and its frictionless linear <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>brake</b> came up during testing. In order to limit the creation of tornado-like vortices that pick up gravel and to limit damage from flying gravel to the train, spoilers have been added under the car joints, under the carbody next to the bogies and under the powered axles on the bogies.The linear <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>brake,</b> which is required for higher speeds, cannot yet be used, because the magnetic field would rip off the magnetic covers of some trackside equipment; those covers {{will have to be}} replaced by non-magnetic ones according to the EU Technical Specifications for Interoperability for international rail traffic in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The {{conversion}} of input energy to heat {{is not always}} undesirable, however, as there are some practical applications. One is in the brakes of some trains known as <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>brakes.</b> During braking, the metal wheels are exposed to a magnetic field from an electromagnet, generating <b>eddy</b> <b>currents</b> in the wheels. This <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> is formed by {{the movement of the}} wheels. So, by Lenz's law, the magnetic field formed by the <b>Eddy</b> <b>current</b> will oppose its cause. Thus the wheel will face a force opposing the initial movement of the wheel. The faster the wheels are spinning, the stronger the effect, meaning that as the train slows the braking force is reduced, producing a smooth stopping motion.|$|R
