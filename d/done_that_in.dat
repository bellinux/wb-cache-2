500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{admitted}} {{his team}} had underachieved during the season, but took criticism of failing to challenge Manchester United {{in the league and}} progressing further in the UEFA Champions League as a [...] "compliment to the club". He spoke in favour of moving FA Cup ties midweek to prevent fixture congestion, because the current system was too demanding for the big clubs: [...] "In England a team that goes for the FA Cup automatically has a problem in the championship, especially if they play in the Champions League. There are then so many games something has to be sacrificed and I have sacrificed points in the championship to the FA Cup." [...] When asked whether reducing the number of teams in the UEFA Champions League would help, Wenger commented it [...] "...would mean less money and no one with the wages we pay can accept a drop in income. As for cutting the Premiership – they have <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> France and now those teams not involved in the cups are complaining." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jakša Ravlić in his discussions {{stressed}} that the bribed court was a [...] "court of public opinion" [...] {{as if it were}} a judgment of nobility, Gundulić would probably, being the member of the court and loyalist of the Dubrovnik Republic himself, tried to repair the embarrassing situation in which the court found itself, but he hasn't <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Dubravka, but he instead made it known to the general public. Thus, character of Grdan couldn't be an allegory for a nobleman, but for a member of another class, dangerous for the nobility, that nobility feared because of its richness and influence. Therefore, the question of Grdan in Dubravka is an internal matter of the Dubrovnik Republic.|$|E
2500|$|In his 2002 {{commencement}} address, {{he described}} his then-current NASA activities as follows: “I am drawing pictures of space vehicles on Mars, but now I'm living inside them, and actually pretending we are ON Mars. I've <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the High Arctic of Canada on Devon Island and more recently in the Utah desert, where I was the Station Commander for two weeks.” He said that “For thirty years we've waited to carry space exploration forward. We're in a transition zone, what I like to call 'Standing on Columbus' dock.'...Today we are called by adventure to another land....It's OUR new land, a new frontier. We're going to Mars....But when?...More practically, we're going within 20 years. Some of you could be walking on Mars before you are forty years old. You just have to believe. Your...attitude...matters. You must believe in discovery and adventure. If you let other people say 'it can't be done,' I can promise you, you will be 50 years old like me one day, and we will STILL be sending tin cans around the Earth, round and round going nowhere.” ...|$|E
