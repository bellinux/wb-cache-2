500|$|Harry Thompson has {{described}} this post-war period as the [...] "greatest upheaval" [...] of Hergé's life. Hergé later {{described it as}} [...] "an experience of absolute intolerance. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible,</b> horrible!" [...] He considered the post-war trials of alleged collaborators a great injustice inflicted upon many innocent people, and never forgave Belgian society for {{the way that he}} had been treated, although he hid this from his public persona.|$|E
500|$|Lucas came up {{with ideas}} that {{involved}} a religious cult devoted to child slavery, black magic and ritual human sacrifice. Lawrence Kasdan of Raiders of the Lost Ark was asked to write the script. [...] "I didn't want {{to be associated with}} Temple of Doom," [...] he reflected. [...] "I just thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible.</b> It's so mean. There's nothing pleasant about it. I think Temple of Doom represents a chaotic period in both their [...] lives, and the movie is very ugly and mean-spirited." [...] Lucas hired Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz to write the script because of their knowledge of Indian culture. Gunga Din served as an influence for the film.|$|E

500|$|The lyrical themes on Dig Me Out {{deal with}} issues of heartbreak and survival. The song [...] "One More Hour" [...] is about the breakup of Tucker and Brownstein's romantic relationship. Before {{the release of the}} album, Spin {{published}} a controversial article discussing Tucker and Brownstein's personal relationship without their permission. Brownstein felt that [...] "it was a complete invasion of privacy. My parents didn't know Corin and I were going out. They didn't know I had ever dated a woman before. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible.</b> I was pissed at Spin, really mad. Luckily my parents are great people, but God forbid I would have some family that would disown me over something like that. And I would have totally held Spin responsible for that." [...] The song features a lot of vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein. Chris Nelson of Addicted to Noise noted that [...] "one can almost hear Tucker crying in the studio as she wails, 'I needed it', while behind her Brownstein offers her attempts at consolation". In her 2015 memoir Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl, Brownstein also states that almost all the songs on Dig Me Out are about either her or Tucker's future husband, Lance Bangs.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible.</b> I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [...] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{mid to late}} 1980s {{were not}} a {{particularly}} happy time for Sulley, as she {{had to deal with}} the personal problems unexpected international fame brought her. Also, internal disputes and pressure to produce more hits caused conflict, and eventually splits, within The Human League. When asked in late 1995 to describe that period, Sulley said: [...] "I hated the 1980s, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible</b> … absolutely all of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2001, Hughes and Cumia {{began to}} host XFL Gameday, the pre-game show for Vince McMahon's startup American {{football}} league, the XFL, produced by NBC and aired in New York City. The show, taped weekly at the WWF restaurant in Times Square, featured analysis by sportscaster Bruce Beck and football coach Rusty Tillman and risque content; one such segment featured Hughes and Cumia as chefs inserting a cucumber in between two melons. The show was cancelled after four weeks; McMahon {{stated that he}} had no creative control, adding: [...] "I heard <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible.</b> Had I seen it, I would have shut it down." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 2014, Haye became vegan. He also {{launched}} his own range of vegan protein. Haye gave up eating animal products {{at the beginning}} of 2014 and was immediately open about his reasons for doing so. [...] "I watched a TV documentary about how animals are farmed, killed and prepared for us to eat," [...] he explained. [...] "I saw all those cows and pigs and realised I couldn't {{be a part of it}} any more. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible.</b> I did some research to make sure I could still obtain enough protein to fight and, once satisfied that I could, I stopped. I'll never go back." [...] He was named one of PETA's Sexiest Vegan Celebrities of 2014 in UK.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2008, {{she joined}} Carrie Underwood, a long-time {{vegetarian}}, in giving up eating meat. Pickler says she first {{decided to go}} vegetarian for health reasons, but a TV ad that vegetarian Pamela Anderson did for animal rights group PETA piqued her curiosity. [...] "One night I couldn't sleep and I was up and just Googling random stuff and I'm like, 'Hmmm, PETA.' I saw all the videos and I just thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible.</b> It's animal cruelty. A {{lot of it has}} to do with knowing what happens to the animals and it really bothered me and so I will not eat meat." [...] In May 2009, it was announced that Pickler was nominated for, and won, the title of [...] "World's Sexiest Vegetarian" [...] by PETA.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{literary}} efforts originated {{after the}} experience, according to her, of a life-defining moment on 29 December 2000. She, her son Benjamin, daughter Jemima {{and her two}} sons, plus her niece Lady Cosima Somerset and her two children were travelling to Kenya, when a passenger on their British Airways plane stormed into the cockpit and tried to seize the controls. The autopilot on the flight to Nairobi became temporarily disengaged and the jumbo was knocked off course, abruptly diving and plunging [...] below. [...] "Nobody on that plane thought, 'am I going to die?'" [...] she later recalled. [...] "They all thought, 'we are going to die'. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible,</b> horrible." [...] This near-death incident has been credited by Lady Annabel as the catalyst for her writings. [...] "I had always thought that I would write a book", she claimed, [...] "but writing my memoirs didn't really come into my head until after that flight." [...] In the introduction to Annabel, she wrote: ...|$|E
6000|$|The devouring {{hatred of}} his look was {{matched by the}} ferocious vindictiveness of his tone, as he spoke those words. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible</b> to see him; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible</b> to hear him.

6000|$|When a man commits a crime, society claps him in prison. A {{prison is}} one of the worst hotels imaginable. The people there are low and vulgar. The butter is bad, the coffee <b>is</b> green. Ah, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>horrible!</b> ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{tears were}} {{standing}} in his eyes. Demorest regarded him again with vacant wonder. Tears!--not for Joan's unfaithfulness to him--but for this silly girl's transitory sentimentalism. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible!</b> ...|$|E
60|$|Oh! <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible!</b> What could I say? How was I to stop him? How much dare I tell? I caught {{hold of his}} hands, {{and held}} them tightly.|$|E

6000|$|... "I daresay--though Nature {{does not}} mind waste, or {{what seems to}} be waste. But why should you think of living {{eternally}} at all? Many people live a great deal too long as <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>horrible</b> to believe that they go on for ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mirah {{is quite}} right to scold you, Hans. You are always taking Mr. Deronda's name in vain. And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>horrible,</b> joking {{in that way}} about his marrying Mrs. Grandcourt. Men's minds must be very black, I think," [...] ended Mab, with much scorn.|$|R
60|$|Eric sat in dismayed {{silence for}} a moment. That {{beautiful}} creature afflicted in such a fashion--why, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible!</b> Mingled with his dismay was a strange pang of personal regret and disappointment.|$|E
60|$|Mysteriously aching, nebulously sad, {{she slipped}} away, half-convinced but only half-convinced that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible</b> and unnatural, this {{postponement}} of release of mother-affection, this sacrifice to her opinionation {{and to his}} cautious desire for prosperity.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked down}} at the tangled wet hair, the wild, bare, animal shoulders. He was amazed, bewildered, and afraid. He had never thought of loving her. He had never wanted to love her. When he rescued her and {{restored}} her, he was a doctor, and she was a patient. He had had no single personal thought of her. Nay, this introduction of the personal element was very distasteful to him, a violation of his professional honour. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible</b> to have her there embracing his knees. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrible.</b> He revolted from it, violently. And yet--and yet--he had not the power to break away.|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} time, {{we want to}} be warlike tigers. That is the horror: the {{confusing}} of the two ends. We warlike tigers fit ourselves out with machinery, and our blazing tiger wrath is emitted through a machine. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> a <b>horrible</b> thing to see machines hauled about by tigers, at the mercy of tigers, forced to express the tiger. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> a still more horrible thing to see tigers caught up and entangled and torn in machinery. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>horrible,</b> a chaos beyond chaos, an unthinkable hell.|$|R
