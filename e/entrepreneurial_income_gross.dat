40|$|AbstractSet {{within the}} context of New Institutionalism, this article {{analyzes}} the impact of institutional change on Russian agriculture. Institutions are important because they create opportunity and incentives. The market-based institutional framework introduced in the 1990 s acted as an independent variable that facilitated growth in <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> and an increase in rural stratification. Further, institutions contributed to land expansion by a stratum of upper income households. As a dependent variable, indigenous factors influence the economic outcomes that flow from new institutions with a twofold effect: regional variance is significant for <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> and land expansion; and some households experienced much higher <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> and land expansion...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} {{decomposition}} analysis of inequality by income source {{to understand and}} explain particular aspects of income inequality in Greece. The results suggest that <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> {{is the most significant}} contributor to overall inequality in Greece. It is also shown that there is a weak redistributive impact of taxes and social security contributions and this is mainly attributed to tax evasion, particularly in <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income.</b> The decrease of the inequality of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> appears to be the most effective way of reducing total inequality. Overall this analysis may help to establish links between the functional and personal income distribution. Therefore, our ability to evaluate and predict the potential implications of particular growth policies to inequality, poverty and, consequently, to social development, is significantly improved.

40|$|Education is a {{well-known}} driver of (<b>entrepreneurial)</b> <b>income.</b> The measurement of its influence, however, suffers from endogeneity suspicion. For instance, ability and occupational choice are mentioned as driving both the level of (<b>entrepreneurial)</b> <b>income</b> and of education. Using instrumental variables can provide a way out. However, three questions remain: whether endogeneity is really present, whether it matters and whether the selected instruments make sense. Using Bayesian methods, {{we find that the}} relationship between education and <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> is indeed endogenous and that the impact of endogeneity on the estimated relationship between education and income is sizeable. We do so using family background variables and show that relaxing the strict validity assumption of these instruments does not lead to strongly different results. This is an important finding because family background variables are generally strongly correlated with education and are available in most datasets. Our approach is applicable beyond the field of returns to education for income. It applies wherever endogeneity suspicion arises and the three questions become relevant.

In this paper we try to shed light on this question by 1) comparing <b>gross</b> <b>incomes</b> in SILC with <b>gross</b> <b>incomes</b> reported on the fiscal form for the same individuals; 2) testing a re-calibration of <b>gross</b> <b>incomes</b> proposed by Immervoll and O’Donoghue (2001), to make them consistent with reported net incomes.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the taxation {{of small business}} and <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>incomes</b> in Poland. In both transition economies and existing West European market economies, the efficient taxation of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>incomes</b> presents particular difficulties, {{partly due to the}} absence of clearly defined `borderlines', for example between labour and capital incomes, and between business expenses and private consumption. The treatment of income volatility, of social insurance contributions, and of inheritance by the tax system can easily have a non-neutral impact on the balance between entrepreneurial investment and other investments. The paper considers how these problems could be addressed, and outlines a number of issues specific to the taxation of entrepreneurs in transition economies.

40|$|How {{valuable}} are {{cognitive and}} social abilities for entrepreneurs 2 ̆ 019 incomes {{as compared to}} employees? We answer three questions: (1) To what extent does a composite measure of ability affect an entrepreneur's earnings relative to employees? (2) Do different cognitive abilities (e. g. math ability, language ability) and social ability affect earnings of entrepreneurs and employees differently?, and (3) Does the balance in these measured ability levels affect an individual's earnings? Our individual fixed-effects estimates of the differential returns to ability for spells in entrepreneurship versus wage employment account for selectivity into entrepreneurial positions as determined by fixed individual characteristics. General ability has a stronger impact on <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>incomes</b> than on wages. Entrepreneurs and employees benefit from different sets of specific abilities: Language and clerical abilities have a stronger impact on wages, whereas mathematical, social and technical ability affect <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>incomes</b> more strongly.
