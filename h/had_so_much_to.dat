500|$|As the Arthurian legends do {{not reflect}} genuine {{historical}} events, not being set in any one singular period in time, the show's creators {{were more interested in}} conveying a world that felt [...] "real". Not constrained by [...] historical accuracy, they had many opportunities to build the world in which they set their series; for example, tomatoes were included despite being absent from Europe in the Medieval era, and there was never a dragon in the earliest texts involving Merlin. The series was intended to have an [...] "epic scale" [...] that would have a wide [...] "cross-generational" [...] appeal; films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark were cited as inspiration. Despite this, the creators strived to have smaller moments that the audience could relate to and comedy to lighten the darker tone. A fairy-tale aspect was also incorporated - highlighted in [...] "The Dragon's Call" [...] with the singing and cobwebs - to set the programme apart from others. Beauty and the Beast was an inspiration in this respect. Merlin was also influenced by the US show Smallville, about the early years of Superman; Murphy and Capps said that Smallville helped provide the idea of a [...] "Camelot that existed before its golden age". The creators wanted to show Merlin, Arthur, Gwen and Morgana in their youth, [...] "before they were famous". Murphy and Capps intended for the four young characters and situations to be relatable to young viewers. They also put the characters in unusual positions with respect to their later, well-known roles to make the audience wonder how they would reach those roles; for example, Guinevere, the future Queen of Camelot and wife of Arthur, is a servant with a romantic interest in Merlin. Looking back at [...] "The Dragon's Call", Murphy and Capps felt that it <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> introduce in terms of world and characters that there was not enough of the main plot of the episode.|$|E
2500|$|Following Ruby's March 1964 {{conviction}} for murder with malice, Ruby's lawyers, led by Sam Houston Clinton, {{appealed to the}} Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the highest criminal court in Texas. Ruby's lawyers argued {{that he could not}} have received a fair trial in Dallas because of the excessive publicity surrounding the case. A year after his conviction, in March 1965, Ruby conducted a brief televised news conference in which he stated: [...] "Everything pertaining to what's happening has never come to the surface. The world will never know the true facts of what occurred, my motives. The people who <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> gain, and had such an ulterior motive for putting me in the position I'm in, will never let the true facts come above board to the world." [...] When asked by a reporter, [...] "Are these people in very high positions, Jack?", he responded [...] "Yes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1949 Marcel Duchamp {{commented on}} Paul Klee: [...] "The first {{reaction}} {{in front of}} a Klee painting is the very pleasant discovery, what everyone of us could or could have done, to try drawing like in our childhood. Most of his compositions show at the first glance a plain, naive expression, found in children's drawings. [...] At a second analyse one can discover a technique, which takes as a basis a large maturity in thinking. A deep understanding of dealing with watercolors to paint a personal method in oil, structured in decorative shapes, let Klee stand out in the contemporary art and make him incomparable. On the other side, his experiment was adopted in the last 30 years by many other artists as a basis for newer creations in the most different areas in painting. His extreme productivity never shows evidence of repetition, as is usually the case. He <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> say, that a Klee never became an other Klee." ...|$|E

2500|$|By doing this, Hegelian critics accuse Kierkegaard {{of using}} the {{dialectic}} to disprove the dialectic, which seems somewhat contradictory and hypocritical. However, Kierkegaard would not claim the dialectic itself is bad, only the Hegelian premise that the dialectic {{would lead to a}} harmonious reconciliation of everything, which Hegel called the Absolute. Kierkegaard stated this most clearly in his book The Concept of Anxiety, Dogmatics must not explain hereditary sin but rather explain it by presupposing it, like that vortex about which Greek speculation concerning nature <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> say, a moving something that no science can grasp. That such is the case with dogmatics will readily be granted if once again time is taken to understand Schleiermacherâ€™s immortal service to this science. He was left behind long ago when men chose Hegel. Yet Schleiermacher was a thinker in the beautiful Greek sense, a thinker who spoke only of what he knew. Hegel, on the contrary, despite all his outstanding ability and stupendous learning, reminds us again and again by his performance {{that he was in the}} German sense a professor of philosophy on a large scale, because he a tout prix [...] must explain all things.
