After concluding a battle with Zerah of Egypt in the 10th year of his reign, there was peace in Judah (...) until the 35th year of Asa's reign (...) [...] In his 36th year he was confronted by Baasha, king of Israel. He formed an alliance with Ben-Hadad I, king of Aram Damascus, and using a monetary bribe, convinced him to break his peace treaty with Baasha and invade the Northern Kingdom. (...) He died greatly honoured by his people, and was considered {{for the most part}} a righteous king. He threw the prophet Hanani in jail and [...] "oppressed some of the people the same time" [...] (2 Chronicles 16:10). It is also recorded of Asa that in his old age, when afflicted with a <b>foot</b> <b>disease,</b> he “sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians”.|$|E
