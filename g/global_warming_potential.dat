5|$|Halogenated refrigerants, termed Freons in {{informal}} contexts, {{are identified}} by R-numbers that denote {{the amount of}} fluorine, chlorine, carbon, and hydrogen present. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) like R-11, R-12, and R-114 once dominated organofluorines, peaking in production in the 1980s. Used for air conditioning systems, propellants and solvents, their production was below one-tenth of this peak by the early 2000s, after widespread international prohibition. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were designed as replacements; their synthesis consumes more than 90% of the fluorine in the organic industry. Important HCFCs include R-22, chlorodifluoromethane, and R-141b. The main HFC is R-134a with {{a new type of}} molecule HFO-1234yf, a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) coming to prominence owing to its <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential</b> of less than 1% that of HFC-134a.|$|E

40|$|GWP and multi-GHG price {{instruments}} 2 <b>Global</b> <b>Warming</b> <b>Potentials</b> and multi-greenhouse {{gas price}} instruments Abstract. The paper revisits {{the concept of}} <b>Global</b> <b>Warming</b> <b>Potentials</b> (GWP) from an economic perspective. Multi-greenhouse gas issues are analyzed using a general, dynamic, welfare-maximizing framework. The results confirm that the GWP induces a bias when used as the economic equivalence rule between greenhouse gases. In the linear damage case, we underline the trade-off between the time horizon used in GWP computation and the social discount rate. The standard definition of the GWP is shown to implicitly define different discount rates for different gases. A geometric interpretation of the second-best GWP-based emission tax is provided. It is shown that {{the change in the}} emission mix is such that total CO 2 equivalent emissions are the same under first-best and GWP-based emission tax regimes only if damages are linear. In the quadratic damage case, emission trajectories and steady-stat...|$|R

25|$|The annual <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potential</b> of {{tropospheric ozone}} is between 918–1022 tons carbon dioxide equivalent/tons tropospheric ozone.

However, tropospheric ozone is a short-lived greenhouse gas, which decays in the atmosphere {{much more quickly than}} carbon dioxide.

40|$|To date, {{there is}} still a lack of {{reliable}} data about fluxes of greenhouse gases and <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potentials</b> for organic soils to determine the climatic relevance and supply the National Inventory Report for the German Greenhouse Gas Inventory. In this study, flux rates of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane and <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>potentials</b> for different organic soils in Northern Germany were achieved. The gas exchange was measured roughly monthly year-round with a closed chamber technique. Transparent and opaque closed chambers were used, to separate ecosystem respiration and gross primary production, and to include the vegetation in the measurements, to factor the influence of the plants into the gas exchange. The CO 2 exchange was modelled at high resolution with site parameters with the measured and modelled values fitting very well together. A recommended measure is to achieve a water level of a few centimetres below ground surface. A high intensity land use should be avoided.
