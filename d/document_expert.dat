2500|$|As media {{coverage}} widened and intensified, CBS at first attempted to produce additional {{evidence to support}} its claims. On September 11, a CBS News segment stated that <b>document</b> <b>expert</b> Phillip Bouffard thought the documents [...] "could have been prepared on an IBM Selectric Composer typewriter, available at the time." [...] The Selectric Composer was introduced in 1966 for use by typesetting professionals to generate camera-ready copy; according to IBM archives describing this specialized equipment, [...] "To produce copy which can be reproduced with 'justified', or straight left-and right-hand margins, the operator types the copy once and the composer computes the number of spaces needed to justify the line. As the operator types the copy a second time, the spaces are added automatically.") Bouffard's comments were also cited by the Boston Globe in an article entitled [...] "Authenticity backed on Bush documents." [...] However, the Globe soon printed a retraction regarding the title. CBS noted that although General Hodges was now stating he thought the documents were inauthentic, [...] "we believed General Hodges {{the first time we}} spoke with him."

50|$|Three {{months later}} Mackenzie {{published}} one old letter, supposedly from the poet Robert Burns, in the Cumnock Express newspaper.

50|$|Among the {{investigators}} were sceptic Joe Nickell and <b>document</b> <b>expert</b> Kenneth W. Rendell.

Written in a genuine Victorian scrapbook, but with 20 pages at the front end torn out, he also found this suspect as there was no logical explanation for the purported author to use such a book.|$|E

Kennedy to Marilyn Monroe and mobster Sam Giancana, and made use of typewriters owned by the Tytell's repair store. His son's expertise was utilized in the investigation of the Killian documents controversy, which involved six documents critical of President George W.

50|$|The General Assembly 1937 passed {{legislation}} that established the State Bureau of Identification and Investigation (SBII) which was directly {{overseen by the}} governor. To finance the bureau, every criminal case finally disposed of in the courts had a $1 additional cost assessed and paid to the State Treasurer of North Carolina. One-half of this amount was to be allotted to the bureau. In 1942 SBI Director Fred C. Handy wrote this the following in the News & Observer about the early months for the agency. “One year {{after the passage of}} the act, on March 15, 1938, the governor Clyde R. Hoey appointed a director with authority to proceed with the creation and operation of the bureau… On July 1, 1938, the first special agent was appointed, and during the same month a firearms identification and questioned <b>document</b> <b>expert</b> entered the services of the bureau. On Aug. 15, 1938, the first fingerprint expert was employed. Necessary scientific equipment for the bureau was secured during the following months and made ready for service to the enforcement agencies of the state…”Two years later in 1939 the legislature authorized the North Carolina Department of Justice, transferring the (SBII) responsibilities, materials, and funds into the department. In the following decades, the General Assembly passed and enacted several laws giving new roles to the Bureau, which included authorizing private detectives within the state, and investigating arson and damage to, theft of, or misuse of state-owned property.|$|E
