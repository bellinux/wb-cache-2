40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a primerless {{electrostatic}} spray deposition process (ESD) for coating thermoplastic (PA 66) substrates using epoxypolyester, metallic epoxy-polyester, and <b>epoxy</b> <b>powder</b> <b>paint.</b> A novel and never before used pretreatment system, based on a low speed cold spray of fine copper powders, applied a thin conductive film on the plastic substrate, which made the ESD possible. The focus of {{first part of the}} paper is on analyzing the influence of both electrical and aerodynamic process parameters on ESD process. Differences in behavior of the powders used were evident. Design of experiments (DOE) was used to plan experimental trials and related ANOVA tables were made and used as support instruments to interpret the experimental findings, process modeling, and to the understand physical phenomena involved in the deposition process. As a result, several process maps were produced in which consistent trends of coating thickness and average roughness vs. operative parameters are reported. Careful qualification of the polymeric films was also carried out using the most relevant performance indicators. The second part of the paper focuses on assessing the influence of exposure time on coating thickness and average roughness of the polymeric films, that is, once the electrical and aerodynamic parameters had been optimized.

40|$|According to the {{experimental}} results and the basic concept that the capacitive contribution of the coating/metal system to EIS can reflect the change occurring at interface sensitively, the quantitative relationship between the adhesion and the analytical result of EIS is established. The approach is using the transmission line model (CR circuit) to obtain the discrete capacitance values, analyzing the physical meaning of the slope at the region in which the discrete capacitances change linearly with the discrete characteristic frequency. The data handling method is also given in detail. The relationship is validated by experiments. The results show that under certain conditions, the slopes are mainly determined by the speed of instantaneous delamination at organic coating/metal interface and are not influenced by the corrosion product built up at the artificial defect, so they have good reproducibility despite the EIS of duplicate samples showing very different configuration. The analytical results from EIS are often {{higher than that of}} mechanical measurements when adhesion is strong. Explanation of the discrepancy shows that the results from EIS are more accurate and reasonable. In regard to <b>epoxy</b> <b>powder</b> <b>paints</b> and A(3) steel, the results also indicate that the pretreatment of substrate using silane with and without hot-dip galvanized or phosphate treatment can influence markedly the adhesion between substrate and coating...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} new paint {{systems that are}} less harmful to the {{environment}} and to man than traditional solvent-borne systems, but have identical anti-corrosive characteristics, is an issue of great interest at the present time. The authors of this work have taken advantage of the opportunity to use different natural atmospheres in the Ibero-American region to study the behaviour of new water-borne, high-solids and <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> systems, with and without pre-treatment. The study has involved coatings exposure in 7 natural atmospheres and different laboratory accelerated tests. It was completed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analysis, and adhesion, water up-take and electrochemical measurements. It has been concluded that water-borne acrylic paint systems incorporating primers pigmented with zinc phosphate and others show deficient behaviour in marine atmospheres, but better behaviour in industrial atmospheres. In marine atmospheres, water-borne epoxy paint systems, including zinc-rich primers, together with epoxy and epoxy-polyurethane high-solids paint systems, present the most efficient anti-corrosive behaviour. The coatings obtained with <b>epoxy</b> and epoxy-polyester <b>powder</b> <b>paints</b> only show good behaviour, when applied on an adequate pre-treatment, in atmospheres of low to medium corrosivity category (C 2 -C 3). Finally, the best correlation was observed between the results of natural exposure in marine atmospheres, salt spray and water up-take measurements. It was not possible to verify good correlation between natural exposure and prohesion, adhesion and electrochemical tests. The latter are highly sensitive to the chemical nature of coatings, and seem to be significantly more useful when comparing coatings with more identical nature. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 2001.

40|$|Both color keyed {{and color}} {{specific}} liquid primers {{have been used}} successfully in automotive paint application, reducing the use of costly topcoat materials. Generally, color keyed primer is close in color to the topcoat and {{is applied to the}} exterior surfaces of the vehicle body. Color specific primer identically matches the topcoat material color, and {{can be used as a}} replacement for topcoat on interior surfaces. Application of color <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> primer would provide for additional cost savings, more environment-friendly manufacturing, and higher customer satisfaction. Recent technology breakthroughs have led to the technical feasibility of applying multicolor <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> with full reclaim and therefore 100 % material utilization. The field feasibility of applying multicolor <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> in an automotive manufacturing facility is being assessed and validated by GM. More specifically, GM has developed the GM Canister <b>Powder</b> <b>Paint</b> Delivery System to meet the challenges of color <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> application. In anticipation of multicolor <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> application, GM is completing its Manufacturing Systems Qualification (MSQ) Process for the Canister System. Due to the newness of the enabling technology, GM is investigating all aspects of materials, process designs, facilities, operations, and people, for the implementation of color keyed/color specific <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> primer into new GM paint shops. Similar to GM's MSQ Process, qualification requirements in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry attest to the importance of validation in the implementation of new manufacturing technology. Beyond its technical purposes, validation can serve as a bridge between development and operation. During development, formal and relational contracts with(cont.) suppliers should be established to provide incentives for the supplier to perform throughout validation and commissioning. Involving the plant in validation along with suppliers is one means of education and thus empowerment, a key phase of organizational change as described by Professor Shoji Shiba. Leadership can use several change management techniques to help prepare the plant organization for operation of the new manufacturing technology. by Bevin Barberich. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Objectives: <b>Powder</b> <b>painting</b> is an {{alternative}} to solvent-based spray <b>painting.</b> <b>Powder</b> <b>paints</b> may contain organic acid anhydrides (OAAs), which are irritants to the airways and may cause sensitisation. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and immunological response among powder painters and to describe the exposure to OAAs. Methods: In all, 205 subjects in 32 enterprises participated: 93 exposed and 26 formerly exposed workers in 25 <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> shops and 86 unexposed workers. They completed a questionnaire about working conditions and symptoms and took part in a medical examination, which included a lung function test. Urine samples, for determination of two OAAs, and blood samples, for analysis of specific antibodies against the OAAs, were taken. In addition, 33 paint samples were analysed for nine OAAs. Results: The powder painters reported more work-related respiratory symptoms than unexposed subjects did. The prevalence of three or more symptoms was 24 % in subjects with low exposure, 44 % in highly exposed individuals, 46 % in formerly exposed subjects and 19 % in unexposed workers. Asthma symptoms were frequent, 7 %, 40 %, 15 % and 2 %, respectively. Regression analyses of the lung volumes did not show any influence of exposure. IgG, but not IgE, against the OAAs and metabolites of OAAs was found in some subjects, but no associations with the exposure could be observed. OAAs were found in only small amounts in the paint samples. Conclusions: The exposure to organic acid anhydrides was estimated to be low, and yet, IgG antibodies to OAA were observed in some subjects. The prevalence of work-related symptoms from the eyes and the airways was relatively high among the powder painters, and these symptoms, but not the lung volumes, were clearly related to exposure.
