6000|$|Now for my templar {{and poet}} in {{association}} for a libel, like the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in a <b>fiery</b> <b>sign.</b> What the one wants in wit, the other must supply in law. As for malice, their quotas are indifferently well adjusted; the rough draught, I take for granted, is the poet's, the finishings the lawyer's. They begin,--that {{in order to}} one Mr Friend's commands, one of them {{went to see the}} play. This was not the poet, I am certain; for nobody saw him there, and he is not of a size to be concealed. But the mountain, they say, was delivered of a mouse. I have been gossip to many such labours of a dull fat scribbler, where the mountain has been bigger, and the mouse less. The next sally is on the city-elections, and a charge is brought against my lord mayor, and the two sheriffs, for excluding true electors. I have heard, that a Whig gentleman of the Temple hired a livery-gown, to give his voice among the companies at Guild-hall; let the question be put, whether or no he were a true elector?--Then their own juries are commended from several topics; they are the wisest, richest, and most conscientious: to which is answered, ignoramus. But our juries give most prodigious and unheard-of damages. Hitherto there is nothing but boys-play in our authors: My mill grinds pepper and spice, your mill grinds rats and mice. They go on,--"if I may be allowed to judge;" [...] (as men that do not poetize may be judges of wit, human nature, and common decencies;) so then the sentence is begun with I; there is but one of them puts in for a judge's place, that is, he in the grey; but presently it is--men; two more in buckram would be judges too. Neither of them, it seems, poetize; that is true, but both of them are in at rhime doggrel; witness the song against the bishops, and the Tunbridge ballad[35]. By the way, I find all my scribbling enemies have a mind to be judges, and chief barons. Proceed, gentlemen:--"This play, as I am informed by some, who have a nearer communication with the poets and the players, than I have,--". Which of the two Sosias is it that now speaks? If the lawyer, it is true he has but little communication with the players; if the poet, the players have but little communication with him; for it is not long ago, he said to somebody, [...] "By G----, my lord, those Tory rogues will act none of my plays." [...] Well, but the accusation,--that this play was once written by another, and then it was called the [...] "Parisian Massacre." [...] Such a play I have heard indeed was written; but I never saw it[36]. Whether this be any of it or no, I can say no more than for my own part of it. But pray, who denies the unparalleled villainy of the papists in that bloody massacre? I have enquired, why it was not acted, and heard it was stopt by the interposition of an ambassador, who was willing to save the credit of his country, and not to have the memory of an action so barbarous revived; but that I tempted my friend to alter it, is a notorious whiggism, to save the broader word. The [...] "Sicilian Vespers" [...] I have had plotted by me above these seven years: the story of it I found under borrowed names in Giraldo Cinthio; but the rape in my tragedy of [...] "Amboyna" [...] was so like it, that I forbore the writing. But what had this to do with protestants? For the massacrers and the massacred were all papists.|$|E
60|$|Brighter it was {{than any}} star in our skies; {{brighter}} than the evening star at its brightest. It still glowed out white and large, no mere twinkling spot of light, but a small round clear shining disc, {{an hour after the}} day had come. And where science has not reached, men stared and feared, telling one another of the wars and pestilences that are foreshadowed by these <b>fiery</b> <b>signs</b> in the Heavens. Sturdy Boers, dusky Hottentots, Gold Coast Negroes, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Portuguese, stood in the warmth of the sunrise watching the setting of this strange new star.|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} case of blebitis that {{occurred}} 3 years later following a combined glaucoma and cataract surgery. It was an atypical presentation, as patient had no classical <b>fiery</b> looking <b>signs</b> of blebitis despite the isolated organism being Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Improvized surgical techniques like use of Mitomycin C, releasable flap sutures though considered {{as part of the}} recommended procedure for better surgical outcomes, their role as potential risk factors for visually blinding complications like endophthalmitis are often overlooked. This case report throws light on such risk factors for bleb associated infections and recommends removal or trimming of all releasable sutures and the need for a regular postoperative follow-up...|$|R
6000|$|The {{sun rose}} red and <b>fiery,</b> a sure <b>sign</b> [...] Of the {{continuance}} of the gale: to run [...] Before the sea until it should grow fine, [...] Was all {{that for the}} present could be done: [...] A few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine [...] Were served out to the people, who begun [...] To faint, and damaged bread wet through the bags, [...] And {{most of them had}} little clothes but rags.|$|R
6000|$|Not that Mollwitz kindled Europe; Europe {{was already}} kindled for some two years past;--especially {{since the late}} Kaiser died, and his Pragmatic Sanction was superadded to the other {{troubles}} afoot. But ever since that Image of JENKINS'S EAR had at last blazed up in the slow English brain, like a <b>fiery</b> constellation or <b>Sign</b> in the Heavens, symbolic of such injustices and unendurabilities, and had lighted the Spanish-English War, Europe was slowly but pretty surely taking fire. France [...] "could not see Spain humbled," [...] she said: England (in its own dim feeling, {{and also in the}} fact of things) could not do at all without considerably humbling Spain. France, endlessly interested in that Spanish-English matter, was already sending out fleets, firing shots,--almost, or altogether, putting forth her hand in it. [...] "In which case, will not, must not, Austria help us?" [...] thought England,--and was asking, daily, at Vienna (with intense earnestness, but without the least result), through Excellency Robinson there, when the late Kaiser died. Died, poor gentleman;--and left his big Austrian Heritages lying, as it were, in the open market-place; elaborately tied by diplomatic packthread and Pragmatic Sanction; but not otherwise protected against the assembled cupidities of mankind! Independently of Mollwitz, or of Silesia altogether, it was next to impossible that Europe could long avoid blazing out; especially unless the Spanish-English quarrel got quenched, of which there was no likelihood.|$|R
