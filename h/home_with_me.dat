25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E
2500|$|Also, {{following}} {{the end of}} the recording, Lennon can be heard saying, [...] "I think that was rather grand. I'd take one <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> OK let's track it. (Gasps) You bounder, you cheat!" [...] (This is a reference to the no-overdub policy that the Beatles had adopted for the Get Back project– [...] "tracking" [...] refers to double tracking the vocals on a recording.) The running time of the Anthology version is 4:05.|$|E
2500|$|In several interviews, Cheung stated {{he had had}} {{a fairly}} unhappy childhood. [...] "I didn't have a happy childhood. Arguments, fights and we didn't live together; I was brought up by my granny." [...] "What I would say most {{affected}} me as a child, was that my parents were not at <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> As a young kid, one could not always understand why his parents weren't at home. This made me depressed sometimes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And now," [...] he added, {{turning to}} Waldron, [...] "which {{would you rather}} do--go <b>home</b> to America <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> or stay here, and travel with Mr. George?" ...|$|R
2500|$|After [...] {{the release}} of his debut solo album Justified in 2002, Timberlake thought he [...] "lost his voice" [...] {{in the sense that}} he did not like what he was doing. He felt [...] "burnt out" [...] after Justified; this partly changed his career's direction, wherein he took a break from the music {{industry}} and instead appeared in films. [...] When he felt inspired to compose songs again, he did not choose to reunite with his former band NSYNC, although he considered doing it after his first record. Instead, he went to former Justified collaborator Timbaland's studio in Virginia Beach, Virginia to begin sessions for his second album. However, not one of them had an idea of what the album would be–no plan for it and even a title. [...] "LoveStoned / I Think She Knows" [...] was written by Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, and Nate [...] "Danja" [...] Hills as a sexual love song. In an interview with MTV News, while promoting his second album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, Timberlake revealed that the first half of the album generally focuses on sex. [...] "LoveStoned" [...] contains sexually suggestive lyrics, with the line, [...] "She's going <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> tonight".|$|E
2500|$|After four days, , Changing Woman, went to {{the summit}} of , the Giant Spruce Mountain, and sat on a rock near the spot where she had first felt {{the warmth of the}} sun deep within her body. [...] , the Sun, came and sat beside her. He tried to embrace her, but she stopped him. [...] "What do you mean by that?" [...] she said. [...] "I want you for my own," [...] he replied. [...] "Come to the west and make a <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> there." [...] "I wish no such thing," [...] she said. [...] "I am lonely," [...] said [...] [...] "What good is all that I do if I must endure my days and nights all alone?" [...] After a time a silence, [...] spoke. [...] "I am told you have a {{beautiful}} house in the east. I want such a house in the west. I want it built floating on the shimmering water, away from the shore, so that the Earth-Surface people will not bother me with their quarrels. I want white shell, and blue shell, and turquoise. I want haliotis. I want soapstone, agate, redstone, and jet. Because I will live there alone while you are gone each day, I want animals to keep me company. [...] Give me buffalo, and deer, and mountain sheep, jackrabbits, prairie dogs, and muskrats. Provide me with those things and I shall go with you to the west." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS GEORGE [rising promptly] Oh, indeed. Then {{youre not}} coming <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> young man. I'm sorry; for its {{refreshing}} {{to have met}} once in my life a man who wasnt frightened by my wedding ring; but I'm looking out for a friend and not for a French marquis; so youre not coming <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, here I am, John; {{and what}} is better, I have brought <b>home</b> some money <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> and I shall be able to allow you and the mother a guinea a week {{as long as you}} live.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'My dears, I want {{to drink}} your health and prosperity, and may every blessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with love and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your <b>home</b> here <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I have left to me neither chick nor child. All are gone, and in my will I have left you everything.' I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan {{and the old man}} clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall," [...] he said, [...] "stay in {{this valley}} for the winter; but I shall not keep {{more than a}} hundred, or {{a hundred and fifty}} men <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> The peasants will {{disperse}} to their <b>homes.</b> Those remaining <b>with</b> <b>me</b> will be the inhabitants of the towns; who could not safely return, as they might be denounced by the Spanish spies, in French pay, as having been out <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> We have plenty of supplies stored up here to last us through the winter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> then,' said Mr Crummles, 'and my boys shall go {{with you}} after dinner, and show you the most likely place.' ...|$|E

"I {{shall not}} be angry {{with him in the}} morning," [...] Godfrey said, [...] "because I do think that it is pardonable; but I shall talk seriously to him about it, and tell him that if he is coming <b>home</b> to England <b>with</b> <b>me</b> he must give up spirits. He has done without them so long that it can't be any hardship." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have cut}} your {{articles}} about San Marco {{out of a}} New York paper (Joe Twichell saw it and brought it <b>home</b> to <b>me</b> <b>with</b> loud admiration,) {{and sent it to}} Howells. It is too bad to fool away such good literature in a perishable daily journal.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘My daughter, I am old, and my hairs {{are growing}} gray; while I have no {{children}} {{to make my}} <b>home</b> cheerful. Come <b>with</b> <b>me</b> then, and you shall be a daughter {{to me and to}} my wife, and this babe shall be our grandchild.

Come <b>home</b> to supper <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> and I'll show you a sight that will gladden hearts and eyes," [...] he answered, {{shouldering}} his load and leading {{the way to a}} deserted hermitage, which had served many a fugitive for a shelter. As they went, Gaston poured out his story, and told how Yvonne was waiting for them in the wood.|$|R
60|$|The {{understanding}} {{of the change in}} her came <b>home</b> to <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a shock that must have left me, I think, something white about the lips. I was glad. She was what I had wished her to become. But I wanted the child Betty back; this womanly Betty seemed far away from me.|$|R
60|$|However, {{even though}} I {{knew it was}} the parrot, and that indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good while before I could compose myself. First, I was amazed how the {{creature}} got thither, and then how he should just keep about the place, and no where else: but as I was well satisfied it could be nobody but honest Poll, I got it over; and holding out my Hand, and calling him by his Name Poll, the sociable Creature came to me, and sat upon my Thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to me, Poor Robin Crusoe, and how did I come here? and where had I been? just {{as if he had been}} overjoyed to see me again; and so I carried him <b>Home</b> along <b>with</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I won't come away. I'm {{going to}} take him <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and send for the doctor to come and see him. He's going to be my dog.' ...|$|E

"Well, sirs, it {{happened}} that on the morning in question, I noticed that {{there was very little}} gin left in the bottle; for, though I could not see how much it contained, owing to its being of stone and not of glass, I judged from the manner in which I had to tip it upwards when pouring it out. In order to remember that I had to bring <b>home</b> some <b>with</b> <b>me</b> that day I tied a knot in my handkerchief; then, mounting my horse, I rode out towards the side on which the sun sets, little expecting that anything unusual {{was going to happen to}} me that day. But thus it often is; for no man, however learned he may be and able to read the almanac, can tell what a day will bring forth." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Now my pa is come, shan't I be a gentleman, {{and ride}} in a carriage?' were the sounds that greeted Phoebe's ears {{as she opened the}} door of the study, and beheld the small, lean child dressed in all his best; not one of the gray linen frocks that Lucilla was {{constantly}} making for him, but in a radiant tartan, of such huge pattern that his little tunic barely contained a sample of one of each portentous check, made up crosswise, so as to give a most comical, harlequin effect to his spare limbs and weird, black eyes. The disappointment that Phoebe had to inflict was severe, and unwittingly she was the messenger whom Mrs. Murrell was likely to regard with the most suspicion and dislike. 'Come <b>home</b> along <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> Hoing, my dear,' she said; 'you'll always find poor granny your friend, even if your pa's 'art is like the nether millstone, as it was to your poor ma, and as others may find it yet.' ...|$|R
