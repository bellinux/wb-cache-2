25|$|Borzois {{are born}} with {{specialized}} coursing skills, but these are {{quite different from the}} dog-fighting instincts seen in some breeds. It is quite common for borzois at play to course (i.e., run down) another dog, seize it by the neck and hold it immobile. Young pups <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> their littermates, trading off as to who is the prey. It is a specific hunting behavior, not a fighting or territorial domination behavior.|$|E

25|$|Note: This {{method is}} {{also called the}} chaos game, and {{is an example of}} an {{iterated}} function system. You can start from any point outside or inside the triangle, and it would eventually form the Sierpinski Gasket with a few leftover points (if the starting point lies on the outline of the triangle, there are no leftover points). It is interesting to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> pencil and paper. A brief outline is formed after placing approximately one hundred points, and detail begins to appear after a few hundred.|$|E

25|$|Belugas {{also show}} {{a great degree}} of curiosity towards humans in the wild, and {{frequently}} swim alongside boats. They also play with objects they find in the water; in the wild, they <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> wood, plants, dead fish, and bubbles they have created. During the breeding season, adults have been observed carrying objects such as plants, nets, and even the skeleton of a dead reindeer on their heads and backs. Captive females have also been observed displaying this behaviour, carrying items such as floats and buoys, after they have lost a calf; experts consider this interaction with the objects could be acting as a substitute behaviour.|$|E

25|$|Observe {{that the}} more {{fuel-efficient}} engines can use far less fuel; their mass is almost negligible (relative to {{the mass of the}} payload and the engine itself) for some of the engines. However, note also that these require a large total amount of energy. For Earth launch, engines require a thrust to weight ratio of more than one. To <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> the ion or more theoretical electrical drives, the engine would have to be supplied with one to several gigawatts of power, equivalent to a major metropolitan generating station. From the table {{it can be seen that}} this is clearly impractical with current power sources.|$|E

They <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> the help of Jammer. David discovers that he is the Space Core Commander (all this time, searching for himself). He leads the transmission back to Earth, and through a system of antennas, is processed, and as Jeana accesses the Web page of JPL, he flies through the screen and enters Jeana's eye.|$|E
25|$|Courts {{may receive}} Charter {{questions}} {{in a number of}} ways. Rights claimants could be prosecuted under a criminal law that they argue is unconstitutional. Others may feel government services and policies are not being dispensed in accordance with the Charter, and apply to lower-level courts for injunctions against the government (as was the case in Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)). A government may also raise questions of rights by submitting reference questions to higher-level courts; for example, Prime Minister Paul Martin's government approached the Supreme Court with Charter questions as well as federalism concerns in the case Re Same-Sex Marriage (2004). Provinces may also <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> their superior courts.

Ramos said that the editor of the newspaper had asked for the images of the children to be posted before learning that they were white. Ramos also stated that many Cypress Park residents believed that if one is not from Cypress Park, one should be concerned with crime in his or her own neighborhood rather than in Cypress Park.|$|E
25|$|Having {{surrendered}} a first innings {{deficit of}} 416, England {{now had to}} bat for two days to save the game. They were able to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> considerable assistance from the weather, which ensured that half the remaining available match time was wiped out. By the time the game was determined a draw late on day 5, England had reached 251/6 – a marked improvement on the first innings. Alastair Cook had scored 118, recording England’s first and solitary century on the tour. Sri Lanka, in contrast, had scored 4. England suffered a scare when 3 wickets fell in four balls, including a first ball run out for Ravi Bopara, but they managed to avoid a defeat – which many felt they shouldn’t have. This was {{in contrast to the}} first match in Kandy, when they did deserve to escape with a draw, but didn’t.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} {{addition}} of $800 million of state funds promised in 1978, {{less than half of the}} $600 million authorized in the 1967 bond issue for major construction had been spent. The MTA made improvements to tunnels, tracks, switches and signals. It had to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> a smaller amount of funding than available in the past due to the fiscal crisis, and keep the subway operating 24 hours a day. However, it had a major public relations problem. As people didn't see any improvements, they assumed that crime was out of control, and for a while it was, but this assumption was maintained even during periods of reduced crime. In an attempt to alleviate the crime situation and extend the service life of rolling stock, half-length trains began running during off-peak hours. Infrastructure was in such poor condition that even the 63rd Street and Archer Avenue subway projects were threatened by 1980. The 63rd Street Line was flooded with water, while the Archer Avenue Line could barely be built past Parsons Boulevard.|$|E
