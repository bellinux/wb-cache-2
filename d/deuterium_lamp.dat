50|$|The {{light from}} a mercury lamp is {{predominantly}} at discrete wavelengths. Other practical UV sources with more continuous emission spectra include xenon arc lamps (commonly used as sunlight simulators), <b>deuterium</b> arc <b>lamps,</b> mercury-xenon arc lamps, metal-halide arc lamps, and tungsten-halogen incandescent lamps.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the oldest}} and still most {{commonly}} used technique, particularly for flame AAS. In this case, a separate source (a <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamp)</b> with broad emission is {{used to measure the}} background absorption over the entire width of the exit slit of the spectrometer. The use of a separate lamp makes this technique the least accurate one, as it cannot correct for any structured background. It also cannot be used at wavelengths above about 320 nm, as the emission intensity of the <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamp</b> becomes very weak. The use of deuterium HCL is preferable compared to an arc lamp due to the better fit of the image of the former lamp with that of the analyte HCL.|$|E
50|$|The <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamp</b> emits {{radiation}} {{extending from}} 112 nm to 900 nm, although its continuous spectrum is only from 180 nm to 370 nm. The spectrum intensity does not actually decrease from 250 nm to 300 nm {{as shown in}} the spectrum plot above. The decrease in the plot is due to decreased efficiency at low wavelengths of the photo detector used to measure the lamp intensity. The deuterium lamp's continuous spectrum is useful as both a reference in UV radiometric work and to generate a signal in various photometric devices.|$|E
50|$|A <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamp</b> uses a {{tungsten}} filament and anode placed {{on opposite sides}} of a nickel box structure designed to produce the best output spectrum. Unlike an incandescent bulb, the filament is not the source of light in deuterium lamps. Instead an arc is created from the filament to the anode, a similar process to arc lamps. Because the filament must be very hot before it can operate, it is heated for approximately 20 seconds before use. Because the discharge process produces its own heat, the heater is turned down after discharge begins. Although firing voltages are 300 to 500 volts, once the arc is created voltages drop to around 100 to 200 volts.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the construction and}} performance of a VUV-simulator that {{has been designed to}} study degradation of materials under space conditions. It is part of the Complex Irradiation Facility at DLR in Bremen, Germany, that has been built for testing of material under irradiation in the complete UV-range as well as under proton and electron irradiation. Presently available UV-sources used for material tests do not allow the irradiation with wavelengths smaller than about 115 nm where common <b>Deuterium</b> <b>lamps</b> show an intensity cut-off. The VUV-simulator generates radiation by excitation of a gas-flow with an electron beam. The intensity of the radiation can be varied by manipulating the gas-flow and/or the electron beam. The VUV simulator has been calibrated at three different gas-flow settings in the range from 40 nm to 410 nm. The calibration has been made by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Berlin. The measured spectra show total irradiance intensities from 24 to 58 mW m− 2 (see Table 4. 2) in the VUV-range, i. e., for wavelengths smaller than 200 nm. They exhibit a large number of spectral lines generated either by the gas-flow constituents or by metal atoms in the residual gas which come from metals used in the source construction. In the range from 40 nm to 120 nm where <b>Deuterium</b> <b>lamps</b> are not usable, acceleration factors of 3 to 26. 3 Solar Constants are reached depending on the gas-flow setting. The VUV-simulator allows studies of general degradation effects caused by photoionization and photodissociation as well as accelerated degradation tests by use of intensities that are significantly higher compared to that of the Sun at 1 AU...|$|R
50|$|BioLab's Handling Mechanism (HM) is {{a robotic}} arm that {{provides}} an interface between the ECs and BioLab's analytical instruments, the microscope and spectrophotometer. BioLab's microscope, {{which can be}} controlled by investigators on the ground, has a resolution that ranges from 0.6 to 1.8 micrometers (μm) with a 0.25 μm and 1.0 μm diameter field of view, respectively. The spectrophotometer, which uses tungsten and <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamps,</b> can analyze light passed through the sample in the spectral range of 220 to 900 nm (ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared) with a resolution of 10 nm. Finally, the HM also allows automated transfer of samples from the incubator to the ATCS, which can maintain temperatures between -20 and 10 C with an accuracy of +/- 1 C.|$|R

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the behavior of}} the WFC 3 calibration system for the UVIS channel using data taken during SMOV. The results are compared to those obtained during the thermal-vacuum test 3 in 2008. The tungsten lamp shows a ∼ 10 % higher relative flux rate compared to TV 3, its output dropping at most a percent in most filters over ∼ 45 days. Ratios of the on-orbit to ground flats shows that the flats are stable with no obvious new features, though {{a small percentage of the}} droplets appear to have small subpixel shifts. The <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamp</b> shows a 3 - 8 % drop in the measured count-rates over the duration of SMOV. The deuterium ratios on-orbit to ground flatfields show small scale variations of a ∼ 2 % over the image attributed to contamination of the <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamp</b> surface. These features will limit the usefulness of the deuterium flats in generating difference flats for the calibration pipeline...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Synchrotron radiation, {{with its}} very nature of calculability, has long been {{established}} as a primary source standard for a broad spectral range from x-rays to infrared [1, 2]. In the UV and even shorter wavelength regions, synchrotron radiation stands out as the only standard source available to date since this wavelength region is out of reach to the widely used black body source standard. Transfer UV source standards, such as <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamps,</b> can be readily calibrated against synchrotron radiation. Most recently, such work was reported [3] using the Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility (SURF II) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) where SURF is a dedicated synchrotron source for radiometry. Since then, SURF has undergone a major upgrade to SURF III where the accuracy of all the storag...|$|R

40|$|A program {{exists at}} NIST to {{calibrate}} radiometric {{sources for the}} spectral range from 118 - 350 nm. These include <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamps,</b> hollow-cathode lamps, RF-excited dimer lamps, and wall-stabilized argon arcs. Sources have been calibrated for and used by researchers in solar physics, astrophysics, atmospheric physics (ozone measurements), magnetically controlled fusion, and photobiology. The argon arcs were developed in our laboratory, and provide intense sources of both radiance and irradiance. Calibrations are performed relative to two primary sources, a wall-stabilized hydrogen arc and a 12, 000 K black-body line arc, both developed in our laboratory. Also we recently have begun periodic calibrations on the NIST storage ring, SURF II, to insure consistency between our respective radiometric bases. Various sources have been calibrated for space' applications, including several which are flyable. Also, some development and testing of radiometers for semiconductor lithography were recently carried out with an intense argon arc source...|$|R

Although all the compounds studied showed enhanced fluorescence after photolysis, there were large differences in the absolute level, with the inherent response of the catechol CA 1 being {{much lower than the}} corresponding phenolic CA 4. Brief exposure to the <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamp</b> in a photodiode array detector also resulted in significant enhancement...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that photoemission spectra can be {{obtained}} by exciting the electrons with two phase-correlated wave trains. The phase-correlated wave trains are obtained by sending broad-band ultra-violet light, coming from a <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamp,</b> through a Michelson interferometer. It is possible to stabilize the interferometer within 20 nm on a time scale of a few minutes and is realized without active stabilization, The Fourier transform of the time-dependent electron yield from a polycrystalline silver sample is almost identical to the spectrum determined with the monochromator...|$|E
50|$|We have to {{distinguish}} between line source AAS (LS AAS) and continuum source AAS (CS AAS). In classical LS AAS, {{as it has been}} proposed by Alan Walsh, the high spectral resolution required for AAS measurements is provided by the radiation source itself that emits the spectrum of the analyte in the form of lines that are narrower than the absorption lines. Continuum sources, such as <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamps,</b> are only used for background correction purposes. The advantage of this technique is that only a medium-resolution monochromator is necessary for measuring AAS; however, it has the disadvantage that usually a separate lamp is required for each element that has to be determined. In CS AAS, in contrast, a single lamp, emitting a continuum spectrum over the entire spectral range of interest is used for all elements. Obviously, a high-resolution monochromator is required for this technique, as will be discussed later.|$|R
40|$|In the {{radiometry}} {{laboratory of}} the Physikalisch-Technische,Bundesanstalt at the Berlin electron storage ring BESSY I, radiation sources for radiometric applications in industry and basic {{research in the}} vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectral range are developed, characterized and calibrated. Established sources such as <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamps,</b> Penning and hollow cathode discharge sources have limited spectral ranges and in particular their stability and life time suffers from {{the erosion of the}} cathode material. To overcome these limitations we have developed a radiation source based on the principle of the electron cyclotron resonance ion source. ELISA is a 10 GHz monomode source with a compact design featuring a tunable cavity and axially positionable permanent magnets. The radiation emission of the source can be detected simultaneously in the VUV and X-ray spectral range via a toroidal grating monochromator and a Si(Li) -detector. The special design of the source allows spectroscopic investigations of the plasma in dependence on the cavity tuning and magnet position. A marked influence of tuning and magnet position on the radiant intensity of the VUV and X-ray emission was observed. Using the tuning potential of ELISA krypton plasmas with highly charged ions and intense VUV radiation are generated by very low power consumption in comparison to other VUV radiation sources...|$|R
40|$|Light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs) {{are known}} to be excellent light sources for detectors in liquid chromatography and capillary electromigration separation techniques, but to date only LEDs emitting in the visible range have been used. In this work, a UV LED was investigated as a simple alternative light source to standard mercury or <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamps</b> for use in indirect photometric detection of inorganic anions using capillary electrophoresis with a chromate background electrolyte (BGE). The UV LED used had an emission maximum at 379. 5 nm, a wavelength at which chromate absorbs strongly and exhibits a 47 % higher molar absorptivity than at 254 nm when using a standard mercury light source. The noise, sensitivity and linearity of the LED detector were evaluated and all exhibited superior performance to the mercury light source (up to 70 % decrease in noise, up to 26. 2 % increase in sensitivity, and over 100 % increase in linear range). Using the LED detector with a simple chromate–diethanolamine background electrolyte, limits of detection for the common inorganic anions, Cl–, NO 3 –, SO 42 –, F– and PO 43 – ranged from 3 to 14 µg L– 1, using electrostatic injection at – 5 kV for 5 s...|$|R

SUSpECS was comprised of approximately 180 samples that were suspended {{from the side of the}} International Space Station (ISS) for 18 months and returned to allow for pre- and post-flight comparisons. The sample with the most evident changes was a thin film of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MylarTM coated with Vapor Deposited Aluminum (VDA). The post- flight analysis showed evidence of atomic oxygen erosion of the VDA layer, UV-induced discoloration of the polymer, and a crater created by a micrometeoroid impact. This presentation focuses on the UV-induced discoloration and laboratory tests to simulate these effects. The UV tests expose similar polymers to varying intensities of vacuum UV radiation from <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamps</b> over a condensed time span and quantify the discoloration of the polymers through comparison of the UV/Vis/NIR reflection spectra.

40|$|Solar {{selective}} coatings {{are being}} considered for heat engine and thermal switching applications on minisatellites. Such coatings must have the combined properties of high solar absorptance and low infrared emittance. High solar absorptance is needed to collect solar energy as efficiently as possible while low infrared emittance is needed to minimize radiant energy loss at operating temperature. These properties are achieved in sputter deposited thin films {{through the use of}} molecular mixtures of metal and dielectric. Solar selective coatings having a solar absorptance to infrared emittance ratio of 9 have been successfully deposited using a mixture of nickel and aluminum oxide. The space environment, however, presents some challenges for the use of materials on the exterior of spacecraft, including durability to atomic oxygen and vacuum ultraviolet radiation. To address these concerns, several candidate solar selective coatings were exposed to atomic oxygen in a plasma asher and to ultraviolet radiation in a vacuum facility equipped with calibrated <b>deuterium</b> <b>lamps.</b> The optical properties of the coatings were monitored as a function of time to evaluate their performance over long term exposure to the simulated space environment. Several coatings were found to be durable to both the atomic oxygen and the vacuum ultraviolet environments...|$|R
