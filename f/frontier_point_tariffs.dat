It {{is based on the}} so-called <b>frontier</b> <b>points,</b> which are extracted from the outlines of an object. <b>Frontier</b> <b>points</b> provide 3 -d locations on the object surface where the surface normal is known. This information is exploited to infer the surface reflectance of the object and the light distribution of the scene both under varying illumination and fixed vantage point, and under varying vantage point and fixed illumination. We also show how to apply <b>frontier</b> <b>points</b> for shape recovery in photometric stereo. The effectiveness of <b>frontier</b> <b>points</b> for recovering reflectance, illumination and shape is confirmed by a number of experiments on both real and synthetic data. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{silhouette}} of a smooth 3 D object observed by a moving camera changes over time. Past work has shown how surface geometry can be recovered using the deformation of the silhouette when the camera motion is known. This paper addresses the problem of estimating both the full Euclidean surface structure and the camera motion from a dense set of silhouettes captured under orthographic or scaled orthographic projection. The approach relies on a viewpoint-invariant representation of curves swept by viewpoint-dependent features such as bitangents, inflections and contour points with parallel tangents. Feature points, which form stereo <b>frontier</b> <b>points</b> between non-consecutive images, are matched using this representation. The camera's angular velocity is computed from constraints derived from this correspondence along with the image velocity of these features. From the angular velocity, the epipolar geometry is ascertained, and infinitesimal motion <b>frontier</b> <b>points</b> can be detected. In turn, th [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{estimating}} the epipolar geometry from apparent contours of smooth curved surfaces with affine camera models. Since apparent contours are viewpoint dependent, the only true image correspondences are projections of the <b>frontier</b> <b>points,</b> i. e., surface points whose tangent planes are also their epipolar planes. However, <b>frontier</b> <b>points</b> are unknown a priori and must be estimated simultaneously with epipolar geometry. Previous approaches to this problem adopt local greedy search methods which are sensitive to initialization, and may get trapped in local minima. We propose the first algorithm that guarantees global optimality for this problem. We first reformulate the problem using a separable form {{that allows us to}} search effectively in a 2 D space, instead of on a 5 D hypersphere in the classical formulation. Next, in a branch-andbound algorithm we introduce a novel lower bounding function through interval matrix analysis.

In this paper, we limit the derivation to the case of an uncalibrated camera with possibly varying intrinsic parameters.

40|$|The {{frontier}} of a curved surface is the envelope of contour generators showing the boundary, at least locally, {{of the visible}} region swept out under viewer motion. In general, the outlines of curved surfaces (apparent contours) from different viewpoints are generated by different contour generators {{on the surface and}} hence do not provide a constraint on viewer motion. <b>Frontier</b> <b>points,</b> however, have projections which correspond to a real point on the surface and can be used to constrain viewer motion by the epipolar constraint.
