40|$|Acid β-glucosidase (GCase) is a soluble {{lysosomal}} enzyme {{responsible for}} the hydrolysis of glucose from glucosylceramide and requires activation by the small nonenzymatic protein saposin C (sapC) {{to gain access to}} the membrane-embedded glycosphingolipid substrate. We have used in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) with simultaneous confocal and <b>epifluorescence</b> <b>microscopies</b> to investigate the interactions of GCase and sapC with lipid bilayers. GCase binds to sites on membranes transformed by sapC, and enzyme activity occurs at loci containing both GCase and sapC. Using FRET, we establish the presence of GCase/sapC and GCase/product contacts in the bilayer. These data support a mechanism in which sapC locally alters regions of bilayer for subsequent attack by the enzyme in stably bound protein complexes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{emphasize}} the presence of biofilm on meat surfaces using <b>epifluorescences</b> <b>microscopy</b> and establishing the microbial contamination level by classical microbiological methods. The research was performed in a pork slaughterhouse. The presence of microbial biofilm and the level of contamination were performed on surfaces from pig carcasses and cut pieces. Clusters of microorganisms included in a biofilm matrix were found on the surface of carcasses on sternal region, coast region, coccigian region and on surfaces of cut pieces: chop, front of thighs. Microbial biofilm was present on carcasses and cut pieces at least 3 days length, in regions with high humidity and microbial contamination level ranged of 102 - 103 cfu/ cm 2. The microbial load of the surfaces was assessed using the following microbiological indicators: total viable count (TVC), the number of enterobacteria and Pseudomonas genus. The level of carcasses contamination ranged on average from 1. 3 x 10 cfu/ cm 2 (neck) to 2. 6 x 103 cfu/cm 2 (front of pulp). The proportion of Enterobacteriaceae-positive samples was 60 %, with a low level of contamination (less than 1 cfu/ cm 2). Germs of the Pseudomonas genus were absent in all the analyzed samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} of multilayer films based on poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) and carboxylic-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT-COOH) by electrostatic interaction using the layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition method is reported herein. The multilayer build-up, monitored by UV-Vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies, displayed a linear behavior {{with the number}} of PPV and SWNT-COOH layers deposited that undergo deviation and spectral changes for thicker films. Film morphology was evaluated by AFM and <b>epifluorescence</b> <b>microscopies</b> showing remarkable changes after incorporation of SWNT-COOH layers. Films without SWNT show roughness and present dispersed grains; films with SWNT-COOH layers are flatter and some carbon nanotube bundles can be visualized. The photoinduced charge transfer from the conducting polymer to SWNT-COOH was analyzed by PL quenching either by the decrease of the emission intensity or by the presence of dark domains in the epifluorescence micrographs. Photoelectrochemical characterization was performed under white light and the films containing SWNT-COOH displayed photocurrent values between 2. 0 mu A cm(- 2) and 7. 5 mu A cm(- 2), as the amount of these materials increases in the film. No photocurrent was observed for the film without carbon nanotubes. Photocurrent generation was enhanced and became more stable when an intermediate layer of PEDOT:PSS was interposed between the active layer and the ITO electrode, indicating an improvement in hole transfer to the contacts. Our results indicate that these multilayer films are promising candidates as active layers for organic photovoltaic cells...|$|R

50|$|Acridine orange is {{an organic}} compound. It {{is used as}} a nucleic acid-selective {{fluorescent}} cationic dye useful for cell cycle determination. Being cell-permeable, it interacts with DNA and RNA by intercalation or electrostatic attractions respectively. When bound to DNA, it is very similar spectrally to fluorescein, with an excitation maximum at 502 nm and an emission maximum at 525 nm (green). When it associates with RNA, the excitation maximum shifts to 460 nm (blue) and the emission maximum shifts to 650 nm (red). Acridine orange will also enter acidic compartments such as lysosomes and become protonated and sequestered. In these low pH conditions, the dye will emit orange light when excited by blue light. Thus, acridine orange can be used to identify engulfed apoptotic cells, because it will fluoresce upon engulfment. The dye is often used in <b>epifluorescence</b> <b>microscopy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Polony {{sequencing}} is {{an inexpensive}} but highly accurate multiplex sequencing technique {{that can be}} used to “read” millions of immobilized DNA sequences in parallel. This technique was first developed by Dr. George Church's group at Harvard Medical School. Unlike other sequencing techniques, Polony sequencing technology is an open platform with freely downloadable, open source software and protocols. Also, the hardware of this technique can be easily set up with a commonly available <b>epifluorescence</b> <b>microscopy</b> and a computer-controlled flowcell/fluidics system. Polony sequencing is generally performed on paired-end tags library that each molecule of DNA template is of 135 bp in length with two 17-18 bp paired genomic tags separated and flanked by common sequences. The current read length of this technique is 26 bases per amplicon and 13 bases per tag, leaving a gap of 4-5 bases in each tag.|$|E
40|$|Using {{microinjection}} of probes detectable by <b>epifluorescence</b> light <b>microscopy</b> and {{electron microscopy}} we have provided direct evidence that syncytiotrophoblast {{is a true}} syncytium. We have investigated the freedom of movement of probes injected into the syncytiotrophoblast. These probes appear to move relatively extensively within the cytosolic compartment which forms a ‘maze’ through the membrane-bounded organelles and reticula of the syncytium. Thus mathematical models of certain forms of transepithelial transport based on simple mean and harmonic mean histologically measured thickness of epithelia are unlikely to describe the transepithelial transport pathway of at least some larger molecules, particulates and organelles with great accuracy.

Significant correlations were found between the gluten deformation index and some Mixolab parameters (dough development time, work input at maximum consistency during stage 1) at all used mixing speeds. For each of the mixing speeds used, a mathematical model was developed using dough consistency and work input at different processing times (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 min) as variables. The dough consistency and time point parameters give the best explanation of the variation of the work input, at the same mixing speeds and times...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{membrane}} dye FM 1 - 43 {{has frequently}} {{been used to}} quantify exocytosis in neurons. In epithelia, intense lateral intracellular space staining and fluctuations in baseline labeling produced inconsistent results. Membrane retrieved {{in the presence of}} FM 1 - 43 retains the dye, however, and cells that undergo compensatory endocytosis during and following evoked exocytosis contain punctate, fluorescent particles after washout of external stain. As an alternative measure of trafficking, we quantified the fluorescent puncta retained after dye washout and tested our method on both coverslip-grown cell clusters and filter-grown intact monolayers. Images for analysis were acquired using serial sectioning with either <b>epifluorescence</b> or confocal <b>microscopy.</b> Tests with an intestinal goblet cell line that exhibits basal and ATP-stimulated granule trafficking confirmed that 1), the algorithm identified the same number of internalized particles with either <b>epifluorescence</b> or confocal <b>microscopy</b> acquired images; 2), low density clusters exhibited significantly more internalized particles per cell than either filter-grown monolayers or high density clusters; 3), ATP stimulation significantly increased the number of internalized particles in all preparations; and 4), the number of particles internalized was comparable to capacitance measurements of exocytosis. This method provides a single technique for quantifying membrane trafficking in both monolayers and unpolarized cells...|$|R
50|$|Light sheet {{fluorescence}} microscopy (LSFM) is a {{fluorescence microscopy}} technique with an intermediate optical resolution, but good optical sectioning capabilities and high speed. In contrast to <b>epifluorescence</b> <b>microscopy</b> only a thin slice (usually {{a few hundred}} nanometers to a few micrometers) of the sample is illuminated perpendicularly to the direction of observation. For illumination, a laser light-sheet is used, i.e. a laser beam which is focused only in one direction (e.g. using a cylindrical lens). A second method uses a circular beam scanned in one direction to create the lightsheet. As only the actually observed section is illuminated, this method reduces the photodamage and stress induced on a living sample. Also the good optical sectioning capability reduces the background signal and thus creates images with higher contrast, comparable to confocal microscopy. Because LSFM scans samples by using a plane of light instead of a point (as in confocal microscopy), it can acquire images at speeds 100 to 1000 times faster than those offered by point-scanning methods.|$|E

Now that picoplankton have been characterized, {{they have their own}} further subdivisions such as prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs and heterotrophs that are spread throughout the world in various types of lakes and tropic states. In order to differentiate between autotrophic picoplankton and heterotrophic picoplankton, the autotrophs could have photosynthetic pigments and the ability to show autofluorescence, which would allow for their enumeration under <b>epifluorescence</b> <b>microscopy.</b> This is how minute eukaryotes first became known. Overall, picoplankton play an essential role in oligotrophic dimicitc lakes because they are able to produce and then accordingly recycle dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a very efficient manner under circumstance when competition of other phytoplankters is disturbed by factors such as limiting nutrients and predators.Picoplankton are responsible for the most primary productivity in oligotrophic gyres, and are distinguished from nanoplankton and microplankton. [...] Because they are small, they have a greater surface to volume ratio, enabling them to obtain the scarce nutrients in these ecosystems.Furthermore, some species can also be mixotrophic. The smallest of cells (200 nm) are on the order of nanometers, not picometers. The SI prefix pico- is used quite loosely here, as nanoplankton and microplankton are only 10 and 100 times larger, respectively, although it is somewhat more accurate when considering the volume rather than the length.|$|E

These singularities, identified as crystal dislocations, were observed to terminate always either at a triple node of singularities or at the crystal surface, forming a three-dimensional network of crystal singularities (2. 0 x 10 (6) singularities cm(- 2)), identified as the Frank network.

40|$|Exocytosis in {{the budding}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs at {{discrete}} domains of the plasma membrane. The protein complex that tethers incoming vesicles to sites of secretion {{is known as}} the exocyst. We have used photobleaching recovery experiments to characterize the dynamic behavior of the eight subunits that make up the exocyst. One subset (Sec 5 p, Sec 6 p, Sec 8 p, Sec 10 p, Sec 15 p, and Exo 84 p) exhibits mobility {{similar to that of the}} vesicle-bound Rab family protein Sec 4 p, whereas Sec 3 p and Exo 70 p exhibit substantially more stability. Disruption of actin assembly abolishes the ability of the first subset of subunits to recover after photobleaching, whereas Sec 3 p and Exo 70 p are resistant. Immunogold electron <b>microscopy</b> and <b>epifluorescence</b> video <b>microscopy</b> indicate that all exocyst subunits, except for Sec 3 p, are associated with secretory vesicles as they arrive at exocytic sites. Assembly of the exocyst occurs when the first subset of subunits, delivered on vesicles, joins Sec 3 p and Exo 70 p on the plasma membrane.

40|$|International audienceBackground and Aims Condensed tannins (also called proanthocyanidins) are {{widespread}} polymers of catechins and {{are essential}} for the defence mechanisms of vascular plants (Tracheophyta). A large body of evidence argues for the synthesis of monomeric epicatechin on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum and its transport to the vacuole, although the site of its polymerization into tannins remains to be elucidated. The aim {{of the study was}} to re-examine the cellular frame of tannin polymerization in various representatives of the Tracheophyta. Methods Light <b>microscopy</b> <b>epifluorescence,</b> confocal <b>microscopy,</b> transmission electron microscopy (TEM), chemical analysis of tannins following cell fractionation, and immunocytochemistry were used as independent methods on tannin-rich samples from various organs from Cycadophyta, Ginkgophyta, Equisetophyta, Pteridophyta, Coniferophyta and Magnoliophyta. Tissues were fixed in a caffeine-glutaraldehyde mixture and examined by TEM. Other fresh samples were incubated with primary antibodies against proteins from both chloroplastic envelopes and a thylakoidal chlorophyll-carrying protein; they were also incubated with gelatin-Oregon Green, a fluorescent marker of condensed tannins. Coupled spectral analyses of chlorophyll and tannins were carried out by confocal microscopy on fresh tissues and tannin-rich accretions obtained through cell fractionation; chemical analyses of tannins and chlorophylls were also performed on the accretions. Key Results and Conclusions The presence of the three different chloroplast membranes inside vacuolar accretions that constitute the typical form of tannin storage in vascular plants was established in fresh tissues as well as in purified organelles, using several independent methods. Tannins are polymerized in a new chloroplast-derived organelle, the tannosome. These are formed by pearling of the thylakoids into 30 nm spheres, which are then encapsulated in a tannosome shuttle formed by budding from the chloroplast and bound by a membrane resulting from the fusion of both chloroplast envelopes. The shuttle conveys numerous tannosomes through the cytoplasm towards the vacuole in which it is then incorporated by invagination of the tonoplast. Finally, shuttles bound by a portion of tonoplast aggregate into tannin accretions which are stored in the vacuole. Polymerization of tannins occurs inside the tannosome regardless of the compartment being crossed. A complete sequence of events apparently valid in all studied Tracheophyta is described...|$|R

However, {{the lack of an}} adequate animal model has made it difficult to determine whether infected erythrocytes do indeed interact in vivo in microvessels. Therefore, we made use of an established model of human skin grafted onto severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice to directly visualize the human microvasculature by <b>epifluorescence</b> intravital <b>microscopy.</b> In all grafts examined, infected erythrocytes were observed to roll and/or adhere in not just postcapillary venules but also in arterioles. In contrast, occlusion of capillaries by infected erythrocytes was noted only in approximately half of the experiments. Administration of an anti-CD 36 antibody resulted in a rapid reduction of rolling and adhesion. More importantly, already adherent cells quickly detached. The residual rolling after anti-CD 36 treatment was largely inhibited by an anti–ICAM- 1 antibody. Anti–ICAM- 1 alone reduced the ability of infected erythrocytes to sustain rolling and subsequent adhesion. These findings provide conclusive evidence that infected erythrocytes interact within the human microvasculature in vivo by a multistep adhesive cascade that mimics the process of leukocyte recruitment.

40|$|AbstractThe {{structural}} dynamics of pulmonary surfactant was studied by <b>epifluorescence</b> light <b>microscopy</b> at the air-water interface of a bubble {{as a model}} close to nature for an alveolus. Small unilamellar vesicles of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol, {{a small amount of}} a fluorescent dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine-analog, and surfactant-associated protein C were injected into the buffer solution. They aggregated to large clusters in the presence of Ca 2 + and adsorbed from these units to the interface. This gave rise to an interfacial film that eventually became fully condensed with dark, polygonal domains in a fluorescent matrix. When now the bubble size was increased or decreased, respectively, the film expanded or contracted. Upon expansion of the bubble, the dark areas became larger to the debit of the bright matrix and reversed upon contraction. We were able to observe single domains during the whole process. The film remained condensed, even when the interface was increased to twice its original size. From comparison with scanning force microscopy directly at the air-water interface, the fluorescent areas proved to be lipid bilayers associated with the (dark) monolayer. In the lung, such multilayer phase acts as a reservoir that guarantees a full molecular coverage of the alveolar interface during the breathing cycle and provides mechanical stability to the film...|$|R

The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the accuracy of Hoechst staining observed under <b>epifluorescence</b> wide-field <b>microscopy</b> [living oocyte observation (LivOO) ]by comparison to a reference technique @DNA staining with ethidium homodimer- 2 under confocal microscopy; fixed oocyte observation ~FixOO!#. Four Hoechst 33342 concentrations ~ 200 ng, 500 ng, 1 mg, 2 mg/mL! were tested and 1 mg/mL was the lowest one with the lowest proportion of oocytes in which DNA was missed. At this concentration, LivOO procedure did not affect the degeneration rate. On 379 oocytes observed individually with the two techniques successively, diagnosis of meiosis resumption by LivOO was exact in 87. 3 % of the cases, but the meiosis resumption rate was underestimated ~ 23. 5 % versus 34. 3 % with FixOO; p, 0. 001 !. Diagnosis for metaphase II was exact in 80 % of the cases, but LivOO detected only 72. 7 % of the metaphase II oocytes present. Metaphase rates did not differ between LivOO and FixOO. This study contributes to a better interpretation of in vitro maturation results. The developmental potential of metaphase II canine oocytes sorted after Hoechst staining is to be evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterium}} Vibrio coralliilyticus {{has been}} implicated as the causative agent of coral tissue loss diseases (collectively known as white syndromes) at sites across the Indo-Pacific and represents an emerging model pathogen {{for understanding the}} mechanisms linking bacterial infection and coral disease. In this study, we used a mini-Tn 7 transposon delivery system to chromosomally label a strain of V. coralliilyticus isolated from a white syndrome disease lesion with a green fluorescent protein gene (GFP). We then tested the utility of this modified strain as a research tool for studies of coral host–pathogen interactions. A suite of biochemical assays and experimental infection trials {{in a range of}} model organisms confirmed that insertion of the GFP gene did not interfere with the labeled strain’s virulence. Using <b>epifluorescence</b> video <b>microscopy,</b> the GFP-labeled strain could be reliably distinguished from non-labeled bacteria present in the coral holobiont, and the pathogen’s interactions with the coral host could be visualized in real time. This study demonstrates that chromosomal GFP labeling is a useful technique for visualization and tracking of coral pathogens and provides a novel tool to investigate the role of V. coralliilyticus in coral disease pathogenesis.
