40|$|Stroke is {{a leading}} cause of death {{worldwide}} and the first cause of disability in the Western world. Over the last 20 years, antiplatelet agents have reduced overall stroke rates in primary and secondary prevention in men. However, this has not been the case for women. In this narrative review, the most widely used antiplatelet therapies for primary and secondary prevention in stroke, excluding cardioembolic stroke, will be outlined. First, the largest randomised controlled trials will be analysed as well as the <b>enrolment</b> <b>percentages</b> of women. Second, analyses on sex-interaction effects in each study will be examined. Moreover, the Authors will discuss the need to develop targeted antiplatelet therapies specifically for women. Based on current results, the most randomised clinical trials and meta-analyses on antiplatelet agents in cerebrovascular disease have not performed sub-analyses on sex-related differences and this is mainly because women were underrepresented. Despite this, antiplatelet agents are considered to be equally effective for both sexes in primary and secondary stroke prevention. Finally, aspirin is the most widely studied antiplatelet in women and has been shown to provide greater benefit for women as primary prevention of ischemic stroke without a significant increased risk in haemorrhage...|$|R

The considerable variation in <b>percentage</b> <b>enrolment</b> by electorate is {{explained in terms of}} an under-privileged and a privileged model, with the former being the more relevant.

Attempts to explain spatial variations in informal voting in terms of either a political illiteracy or a political literacy model are found to be inadequate. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper revisits {{the matter}} of {{attracting}} students to study economics, an issue that faces every Australian university economics department. While the Australian economy {{has been in a}} boom phase for some period it has not led to a relative increase in economic degree enrolments for local universities. While some of the Go 8 universities have seen a steady increase in economics degree enrolments between 1995 and 2007, the national picture, taken over a longer period, reveals that economic degree <b>enrolments</b> as a <b>percentage</b> of the overall student population is still falling. The paper concludes with the shy hope that, apart from improvement to the syllabus and teaching methodologies, the marked economic slowdown might elicit an increase in student interest in economics. The paper closes by suggesting that now might be an appropriate time for the regimen of the ideal economics degree offered by Australian universities to be re-examined.

40|$|Many governments set up {{large public}} {{preschool}} programs {{in order to}} expand ac- cess to early education (crowd-in). Public preschools, however, tend to crowd-out private preschool enrollment. This makes such programs less cost-effective because public finances are {{used to pay for}} preschool for children that would have been in (private) preschool oth- erwise. Making fees for public preschools increase with family income is a way to address this trade-off. Yet this creates adverse incentives for parental labor supply. Using methods of optimal nonlinear taxation, we derive a theory of income-contingent public preschool fees that optimally trade-off crowd-in, crowd-out and parental labor supply. The optimal shape of such a fee schedule depends on labor supply elasticities, crowd-in and crowd-out elasticities {{as well as on the}} progressivity of the pre-existing income tax schedule. The more progressive the income tax schedule is, the stronger are the adverse effects of a steep preschool fee schedule on labor supply. We calibrate our model to the U. S. and use in- formation on existing public preschool programs, enrollment rates and quasi-experimental evidence. We find that the government could increase overall preschool <b>enrolment</b> by 11 <b>percentage</b> points (19 percent) solely by targeting current subsidies more efficiently and without spending one single more dollar...|$|R

When making decisions about future consumption, people must make predictions about the utility they will derive from it. While economic theory typically assumes away any difficulty in making such predictions, abundant empirical work has shown that predicting future utility is actually quite difficult; for a review see Loewenstein and Schkade (1999). A particularly robust finding in this literature is that people tend to bias their estimates of future utility towards their current utility, a phenomenon labelled Projection Bias by Loewenstein et al. (2003). While it is sensible to bas...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{enrolment}} data in year 12 mathematics subjects across Australia for {{the years}} 2000 - 2004 are presented. Based on the Barrington and Brown (2005) year 12 mathematics subject categorisations, {{the focus is on}} examining enrolments in “Intermediate ” level subjects, the most likely pre-requisites for tertiary-level mathematics/science-related courses. Enrolment numbers are examined, as too are <b>enrolments</b> expressed as <b>percentages</b> of year 12 cohort sizes. Data for all Australian students, and by gender, are explored and state/territory comparisons are made. The findings have important implications for educational authorities, the tertiary sector, mathematics teachers, and their students. Background and context of the study For some years, there have been concerns nationally and internationally about the declining numbers of students enrolled in and completing tertiary courses in mathematics (e. g., Jensen, Niss, & Wedege, 1998). Thomas (2000) claimed that the “mathematical sciences in Australia are in crisis ” (p. 5), with “an acute shortage of appropriately qualified teachers across schools, falling enrolments in advanced level mathematics and statistics, inadequate support for mathematics education research and a brain drain of many of Australia’s best mathematics scientists ” (p. 6). Since school level mathematics is the basis for tertiary level studies, it seems important to continue to scrutinise enrolments in year 12 mathematics subjects...|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} use of foreign languages in schooling might {{have an important role}} to play in the poor educational outcomes observed on the African continent. Exploiting the Language policy change of 1994 in Ethiopia as a natural experiment, we estimate the effects of provision of mother tongue instruction on the largest ethnic group in the country. Our results suggest that provision of mother tongue education led to an increase of 0. 75 to 1 year of primary schooling in the affected cohort. Moreover the entire increase in the years of schooling {{can be attributed to the}} intensive margin of education. The language policy change, conditional on <b>enrolment,</b> increased the <b>percentage</b> of people completing 6 years or more of schooling by 31 %. Applying our findings to a set of African countries shows that even after accounting for the costs of provision, introduction of mother tongue instruction imply potentially large benefits and increases the percentage of population completing primary schooling by as much as 15 % points. These finding have important policy implications at a time when surging enrolment rates and already stretched educational budgets in the African continent imply need for solutions which can increase the quality of education without requiring huge capital or infrastructural outlays...|$|R
30|$|The {{systems with}} {{the highest levels of}} public {{expenditure}} are not the ones {{with the highest}} enrolment levels. Increasing public expenditure by one percentage point of GDP per capita relates to a decrease in <b>enrolment</b> of 0.65 <b>percentage</b> point. This may indicate a potential under-investment in some ‘crowded’ higher education systems in certain European countries. Moreover, the most research intensive systems also appear to be the ones with lower student enrolment. A one percent increase in enrolment corresponds to a decrease in top publications of 0.12 percentage points. This finding reflects the challenge of matching broad participation in education to ‘excellence’ in research. Going further, the systems with the broadest enrolment {{do not appear to be}} the most innovative ones with the highest levels of labor productivity and knowledge employment. A 1 % higher enrolment rate relates to a decrease of 0.33 Euros of GDP per capita produced per hour and 0.49 percentage points fewer employees in knowledge intensive activities. This finding seems to suggest that quality trumps quantity. In other words, providing students with a relevant teaching and learning experience, and supporting them to graduates, may be more important than simply increasing enrolment numbers. Once confirmed by more methodologically robust analyses, such a finding would have important implications in an era where public expenditures are still often calculated based on the number of students in institutions (although performance-based criteria have gained ground in some European countries).|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of various social and {{economic}} factors the tertiary education sector in New Zealand (as {{well as a number}} of other developed countries) experienced dramatic changes during the 1980 s and 1990 s. Neoliberal regimes advocated changes in higher education policy in order to decrease state resourcing and to align universities towards providing greater economic gains. During the 1990 s and early 2000 s a number of prominent critics argued that a natural consequence of these changes would be a decrease in enrolments in subjects that were seen to be non-vocational. In particular enrolments in subjects within the ‘liberal arts’ were felt to be at threat during the first decade of the new millennium as it was felt that students would employ neoliberal notions of economic rationalism in their selection of higher education, and opt for profitable vocational forms of higher education. By collecting, codifying, and analysing all enrolment figures for both Massey University, and for all universities across New Zealand, for the years 2001 to 2010 it was possible to determine whether liberal arts enrolments experienced a decline within Massey University and New Zealand. The results of this analysis showed that at the national level there is a slight incline in liberal arts subject <b>enrolments</b> as a <b>percentage</b> of overall <b>enrolments,</b> while the Massey data shows a greater incline. The counter-intuitive increase in expressly non-vocational enrolments is attributed to flaws in the argument that liberal arts enrolments would decrease as {{a result of}} the increasing entrepreneurial tendencies of students, and the continuing predilection of students to plan their course of study around personal interest, and not vocational aspiration...|$|R
40|$|In a {{developing}} oil-based economy like Libya {{the availability of}} finance is largely affected by the availability of oil revenues which are subjected to disturbances and shocks. Therefore, the decision to save and invest a certain ratio of the country's aggregate output is, to large extent, determined (and affected) by the shocks in the oil markets rather than the requirements of economic development. In this study an attempt is made to determine the optimal rate of saving and investment, both defined as a ratio of the aggregate output, {{according to the requirements}} of economic development. For this purpose, a neo-classical Ramsey-type model for Libya is constructed and applied to obtain theoretically and empirically the optimal saving and investment rate during the period (1965 - 1991). The results reveal that Libya was investing over the optimal level during the oil boom of 1970 s and less than the optimal level during the oil crisis of 1980 s. In addition, an econometric investigation of the determinants of actual investment by sector (agriculture, non-oil industry, and services) is carried out in order to shed lights on how possible it is for Libya to adjust actual investment towards its optimal level. It is found that, as expected, the most important factor which can be used in this respect is the oil revenues or, generally, the availability of finance. In addition, the study reveals that investment in agriculture is associated, during the period of study, with a very low marginal productivity of capital whereas marginal productivity was higher in both non-oil industry and services. Finally, the study investigates also the future potential saving and investment rates and concludes that the economy, which has already reached its steady state, can be pushed out towards further growth if the economy can be able to increase the level of per worker human capital, proxied by the secondary school <b>enrolment</b> as a <b>percentage</b> of population.
