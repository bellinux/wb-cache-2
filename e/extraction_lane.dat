40|$|Abstract: In this report, we {{introduce}} a mono-vision based lane detection method (pure mono-vision without the aide {{of any other}} sensor). The lane detection method consists of the sub-parts of lane mark segment <b>extraction,</b> <b>lane</b> model fitting, and lane tracking. The lane mark segment extractor is based on some criteria that are only related to the inherent physical properties of the lane marks. The lane model is parameterized in the world (the ground plane) reference instead of in the image reference. The lane tracking is {{carried out in the}} framework of the particle filter, including the evolution and the update of the lane state; a mechanism that executes on-line estimation of the vehicle pitch angle is naturally incorporated in the lane tracking process. Read-data tests are given to demonstrate the performance of the mono-vision based lane detection method.

40|$|Traveling {{safely in}} outdoor environments {{is one of}} the most {{challenging}} activities for vision-disabled people. To improve the mobility of these people, an assistive navigation system is necessary. This paper is a step towards developing this system. We propose a robust method to detect the pedestrian marked lane at traffic junctions. The proposed method involves three stages: patches of interest (POI) <b>extraction,</b> <b>lane</b> marker detection and lane detection. The POI extraction is first performed to detect image patches located on the lane marker boundaries using template matching. Potential lane markers are then formed by using shape and intensity information. Finally, the walkable lane region is determined by verifying pairs of detected potential makers. A probabilistic framework using multiple geometric cues is proposed for the verification step. We create a new dataset collected from diverse environments and evaluate the proposed method on this dataset. The experimental results under challenging conditions have illustrated the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method compared to conventional techniques. © 2012 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust and reliable <b>lane</b> <b>extraction</b> algorithm {{to navigate the}} wheelchair robot in real time in outdoor environments. Seven components have been cooperatively utilized to extract lane boundaries on roads with different conditions. Specifically, three features are efficiently extracted to represent two lane boundaries using the lane boundaries in the previous frame. Three weights related to the three features are computed offline by the genetic algorithm for more accurate <b>lane</b> <b>extraction.</b> Furthermore, the average road intensity in all previous frames {{is also used to}} aid the robot in steering to the right direction if the inference-based verification system indicates consistent discrepancies between the current and previous frames. The system has been extensively tested and experimental results demonstrate our system can accurately guide the wheelchair robot in the navigating tasks in real time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} novel block-based tech-niques for robust <b>extraction</b> of <b>lane</b> marking edges in complex scenarios, {{such as in}} the {{presence}} of shadows, vehicles, other road markings etc. The techniques are based on the properties of lane markings and involve a two-stage processing: (1) gen-eration of customized edge maps using histograms of gradient angles, and (2) directional signed edges in combination with Hough Transform to identify lane markings. It is shown that the proposed techniques show a detection accuracy of as high as 98 % on test data collected on real road scenarios, representing the various complex cases. I...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} report new results we have {{obtained}} in applying stereo vision algorithms {{to the problem}} of autonomous vehicle navigation on highways. The project consists of two parts: <b>lane</b> <b>extraction</b> and obstacle detection. Our <b>lane</b> <b>extraction</b> system is based on a parameterized model for the appearance of the lanes in the images. This model captures the position, orientation and width of the lane as well as the height and inclination of the stereo rig with respect to the road. A robust lane recognition procedure is employed to recover the position of the vehicle within the lane. This scheme is able to recover and track the lane markers in real time (20 Hz) even {{in the presence of a}} significant number of spurious lane features. We have developed a new real time stereo system (20 Hz) that has been optimized for use in a highway navigation system. The algorithm first extracts vertical line features from a subset of the scan lines in the left and right images. Correspondences are made betwe [...] ...|$|R

Lane 1, 50 -bp ladder; lanes 2 – 8, mummy samples; <b>lanes</b> 9, 10, <b>extraction</b> controls; <b>lane</b> 11, PCR controls. Lane 6 provides a positive amplification {{product of the}} expected size. Leishmania DNA–positive samples in the Nubian mummies (12. 9 %) suggests that leishmaniasis was endemic in Nubia during the Early Christian period and, {{in light of the}} data on the ancient Egyptian mummies, probably already several thousand years before. Taken together, our results support the theory that Sudan could have been indeed the original focus of visceral leishmaniasis (4). Our study shows a completely new aspect of molecular paleopathology. The detection of ancient pathogen DNA is not only used to identify a certain disease and gain information on its frequency and evolutionary origin but also to trace back cultural contacts and their role in the transmission and spread of infectious diseases...|$|R

At the same time, in order to extract the suitable shadow area {{at the bottom of the}} vehicle, the adjacent shadow lines in the y axis direction are merged and traversed row by row to obtain the shadow straight line. When|y 1 [*]−[*]y 2 |[*]<[*]T is met, the two rows are merged, and four pixels are taken as the value for T.|$|R

In this contribution, an approach to evaluate perception performance as a function of quality of the sensor data is presented. Standardized quality metrics support the imaging sensors performance measurement. Several imaging setups are analyzed with real world experiments. The output of each setup is processed offline to track down performance differences with respect to the quality of sensor data. An adapted measurement is calculated to measure the sensor performance with respect to the data quality for the involved perceptive components. The measured performance is assessed by processing the data of different simultaneously recorded imaging setups for the task of feature <b>extraction</b> of road <b>lanes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Lane {{detection}} is {{a crucial}} process in video-based transportation monitoring system. This paper proposes a novel method to detect the lane center via rapid extraction and high accuracy clustering of vehicle motion trajectories. First, we use the activity map to realize automatically the extraction of road region, the calibration of dynamic camera, and the setting of three virtual detecting lines. Secondly, the three virtual detecting lines and a local background model with traffic flow feedback are used to extract and group vehicle feature points in unit of vehicle. Then, the feature point groups are described accurately by edge weighted dynamic graph and modified by a motion-similarity Kalman filter during the sparse feature point tracking. After obtaining the vehicle trajectories, a rough k-means incremental clustering with Hausdorff distance is designed to realize the rapid online <b>extraction</b> of <b>lane</b> center with high accuracy. The use of rough set reduces effectively the accuracy decrease, which results from the trajectories that run irregularly. Experimental results prove that the proposed method can detect lane center position efficiently, the affected time of subsequent tasks can be reduced obviously, {{and the safety of}} traffic surveillance systems can be enhanced significantly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Article Information The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} was to reduce accidents by assisting the driver in various aspects of driving such as lane detection, pedestrian and car detection, driver drowsiness detection and rear view parking assistance. The methodology combines the computer vision techniques with pattern recognition, feature extraction, machine learning, object recognition, human computer interaction and parallel processing in a nutshell. The proposed system provides robust <b>extraction</b> of <b>lane</b> markings in various types and alerts the driver attempting to drift from the lane. It also detects the pedestrians and cars which are at a vulnerable distance {{to be hit by}} the vehicle and alarms the driver well ahead of time. The system uses eye closure based decision algorithm to detect driver drowsiness in all conditions and also warns by interactive voice early enough to avoid the accidents. It also assists the driver while reversing the vehicle, by providing a clear view of his blind spot areas. Computer vision algorithms like Hough’s Transform, Canny Edge detection and HAAR classifiers were applied to meet the objectives. The integrated module was analyzed and tested in different terrains and various lighting condition to produce an accurate and robust real-time assistance system (Sivaraman et al. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) is an {{important}} tool in genomic analysis. The result of PFGE is presented in an image. Each image contains several lanes. And each lane consists of bands. Two lanes are identical if the relative positions of bands are the same. We present a method that uses computer to extract the lanes and compare the lanes in the electrophoresis images. The presented method consists of two major steps. The first step is image processing and <b>lane</b> <b>extraction.</b> The second step is to convert a lane into chain code representation. The lane comparison is carried out through calculating the longest common subsequence between lanes. We define the distance between lanes in term of the LCS and the lengths of two lanes. Two lanes have smaller distance tend to have similar pattern. This method eliminates those very different patterns to help biologists reduce the lanes {{that need to be}} compared...|$|R
40|$|Road {{features}} extraction from remote sensed imagery {{has been}} a long-term topic of great interest within the photogrammetry and remote sensing communities for over three decades. The majority of the early work only focused on linear feature detection approaches, with restrictive assumption on image resolution and road appearance. The widely available of high resolution digital aerial images {{makes it possible to}} extract sub-road features, e. g. road pavement markings. In this paper, we will focus on the automatic <b>extraction</b> of road <b>lane</b> markings, which are required by various lane-based vehicle applications, such as, autonomous vehicle navigation, and lane departure warning. The proposed approach consists of three phases: i) road centerline extraction from low resolution image, ii) road surface detection in the original image, and iii) pavement marking extraction on the generated road surface. The proposed method was tested on the aerial imagery dataset of the Bruce Highway, Queensland, and the results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach...|$|R
