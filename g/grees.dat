40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe Group for the Respect of Ethics and Excellence in Science (<b>GREES)</b> {{organized}} {{a working group}} to assess the value of time to joint surgery as a potential therapeutic failure outcome criterion for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee {{in the assessment of}} potential structure modifying agents. MethodsPubMed was searched for manuscripts from 1976 to 2004. Relevant studies were discussed at a 1 -day meeting. ResultsThere are no accepted guidelines for ‘time to’ and ‘indications for’ joint replacement surgery. A limited number of trials have examined joint replacement surgery within the study population. Several parameters, particularly joint space narrowing (interbone distance), correlate with surgical intervention. However, {{at the level of the}} knee, none of the parameters have positive predictive value for joint replacement surgery better than 30 %. In contrast, lack of significant joint space narrowing has a strong negative predictive value for joint replacement surgery (> 90 %), that remains after controlling for OA pain severity. ConclusionAt this time, <b>GREES</b> cannot recommend time to joint surgery as a primary endpoint of failure for structure modifying trials of hip or knee OA–as the parameter has sensitivity but lacks specificity. In contrast, in existing trials, a lack of progression of joint space narrowing has predictive value of > 90 % for not having surgery. <b>GREES</b> suggests utilizing joint space narrowing (e. g., > 0. 3 – 0. 7 mm) combined with a lack of clinically relevant improvement in symptoms (e. g., ≥ 20 – 25 %) for ‘failure’ of a secondary outcome in structure modifying trials of the hip and knee...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Recent {{innovations}} in the pharmaceutical drug discovery environment have generated new chemical entities {{with the potential}} to become disease modifying drugs for osteoarthritis (DMOAD’s). Regulatory agencies acknowledge that such compounds may be granted a DMOAD indication, providing they demonstrate that they can slow down disease progression; progression would be calibrated by a surrogate for structural change, by measuring joint space narrowing (JSN) on plain X-rays with the caveat that this delayed JSN translate into a clinical benefit for the patient. Recently, new technology has been developed to detect a structural change of the OA joint earlier than conventional X-rays. Objective: The Group for the Respect of Ethics and Excellence in Science (<b>GREES)</b> organized a working party to assess whether these new technologies may be used as surrogates to plain x-rays for assessment of DMOADs. Methods: <b>GREES</b> includes academic scientists, members of regulatory authorities and representatives from the pharmaceutical industry. After an extensive search of the international literature, from 1980 to 2002, two experts meetings were organized to prepare a resource document for regulatory authorities. This document includes recommendations for a possible update of guidelines for the registration of new chemical entities in osteoarthritis. Results: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now used to measure parameters of cartilage morphology and integrity in OA patients. While some data are encouraging, correlation between short-term changes in cartilage structure observed with MRI and long-term radiographic or clinical changes are needed. Hence, the <b>GREES</b> suggests that MRI maybe used as an outcome in phase II studies, but that further data is needed before accepting MRI as a primary end-point in phase III clinical trials. Biochemical markers of bone and cartilage remodelling are being tested to predict OA and measure disease progression. Recently published data are promising but validation as surrogate end-points for OA disease progression requires additional study. The <b>GREES</b> suggests that biochemical markers remain limited to ‘proof of concept’ studies or as secondary end-points in phase II and III clinical trials. However, the <b>GREES</b> emphasizes the importance of acquiring additional information on biochemical markers in order to help better understand the mode of action of drugs to be used in OA. Regulatory agencies consider that evidence of improvement in clinical outcomes is critical for approval of DMOAD. Time to total joint replacement surgery is probably the most relevant clinical end-point for the evaluation of efficacy of a DMOAD. However, at this time, time to surgery can not be used in clinical trials because of bias by non disease-related factors like patient willingness for surgery or economic factors. At this stage, it appears that DMOAD should demonstrate a significant difference compared to placebo. Benefit should be measured by 3 co-primary end-points: JSN, pain and function. Secondary end-points should include the percentage of patients who are ‘responder’ (or ‘failure’). The definition of a ‘failure’ patient would be someone with progression of JSN> 0. 5 mm over a period of 2 – 3 years or who has a significant worsening in pain and/or function, based on validated cut-off values. The definition of the clinically relevant cut-off points for pain and function must be based on data evaluating the natural history of the disease (epidemiological cohorts or placebo groups from long-term studies). These cut-offs points should reflect a high propensity, for an individual patient, to later require joint replacement. Conclusion: <b>GREES</b> has outlined a set of guidelines {{for the development of a}} DMOAD for OA. Although these guidelines are subject to change as new information becomes available, the information above is based on the present knowledge in the field with the addition of expert opinion...|$|E
