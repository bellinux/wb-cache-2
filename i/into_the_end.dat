5|$|Following Florida State's kickoff and a 38-yard return, Virginia Tech's offense {{began work}} at its 45-yard line. On the second {{play of the}} drive, Noel {{completed}} a 55-yard pass to Andre Davis, who ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone for Virginia Tech's second touchdown of the game. The extra point kick was good, and Virginia Tech regained the lead, 1713, with 40seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Georgia's punt rolled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> {{zone for}} a touchback, and with 1:28 {{remaining}} in the game, Virginia Tech began the final drive on its own 20-yard line. Any tension was soon defused by the Georgia defense, which forced threeincompletions and a sack. Glennon's attempt at a Hail Mary pass fell short, giving Georgia the win with a final score of 31–24.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half, defense {{continued}} to dominate as Tech built a lead. The Hokies scored the only points {{of a third}} quarter as running back Lee Suggs ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone from one yard out, allowing Tech to take a 17–10 lead into the fourth quarter. The Falcons didn't give up easily, however. Air Force kicker Joey Ashcroft cut into the Tech lead with a 21-yard field goal. Tech matched the score later in the quarter to restore the one-touchdown lead. As time ran down, Air Force had one final chance {{to tie the game}} and send it into overtime. Beginning at its own 18-yard line with 4:11 left to play, the Falcons drove deep into Tech territory. With seven seconds remaining, Air Force quarterback Chance Harridge tried to scramble <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone, but was stopped before the goal line by Tech cornerback Ronyell Whitaker. The defensive stop preserved the 20–13 Hokie victory, and Tech quarterback Bryan Randall was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E
5|$|Maryland first scored with a halfback option, when Chris Turner {{pitched to}} Da'Rel Scott, who {{connected}} with Darrius Heyward-Bey for a nine-yard pass <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone. In {{the second and}} third quarters, Maryland placekicker Obi Egekeze made fourfield goals. In the final quarter, Danny Oquendo brought down a short pass from Turner and ran it in past two defenders for a touchdown totaling 50yards.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Egekeze {{attempted}} {{to kick the}} ball as it fell off the tee. This resulted in an unintentional squib that was returned 36yards to the Terps' nine-yard line. Nevada's Kaepernick attempted to rush but was stopped for no gain. On the next play, he threw the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone, but it was intercepted by Maryland safety Kenny Tate, resulting in a touchback. The Terps started on their own 20-yard line, and running back Davin Meggett rushed for 13yards and a first down. Turner then linked up with freshman receiver Ronnie Tyler for another first down at the Maryland 49-yard line. After a false start penalty, the Terps were unable to gain a first down and punted the ball away. The ball rolled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone for a touchback, and Nevada started the final drive of the quarter at its 20-yard line. Kaepernick then passed for two first downs, picked up another due to a pass interference call against Maryland, and scrambled for yet another. He then handed off to Taua, who rushed 17yards for a touchdown. Nevada re-took the lead, 14–13, with 46 seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|Several {{improvements}} {{were made}} to image filters and their theory of operation by Otto Zobel. Zobel coined the term constant k filter (or k-type filter) to distinguish Campbell's filter from later types, notably Zobel's m-derived filter (or m-type filter). The particular problems Zobel was trying to address with these new forms were impedance matching <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> terminations and improved steepness of roll-off. These were achieved {{at the cost of}} an increase in filter circuit complexity.|$|E

5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Florida State in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third down and five yards.

40|$|Smoke {{management}} {{design for}} buildings such as atria and multi-level complexes often requires consideration of smoke produced from a balcony spill plume. This work provides new experimental data to characterise entrainment of air into a balcony spill plume using {{the approach of}} physical scale modelling. For a balcony spill plume without entrainment of air <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends,</b> this work has demonstrated that existing simplified design formulae generally apply for plumes generated {{from a range of}} fire compartment geometries. A further simplified design formula is proposed for this type of plume. For a balcony spill plume with entrainment of air <b>into</b> <b>the</b> free <b>ends,</b> <b>the</b> rate of entrainment appears to be specifically dependent on the characteristics of the layer flow below the balcony edge. A simplified design formula is proposed by developing a general empirical expression to describe entrainment of air <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of <b>the</b> plume. This work goes some way to explain and reconcile differences in entrainment reported between previous studies and provides improved guidance to designers of smoke management systems...|$|R

5|$|The game's {{outcome was}} in doubt {{until the final}} minute of play. With 19seconds left on the game clock, Vince Young ran for a {{touchdown}} and regained the lead for the Longhorns. He followed up by running the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone for a two-point conversion. Leinart had time to attempt one pass but his pass fell out of bounds as time expired; UT beat USC by the score of 41–38.|$|E
5|$|The kick bounced out {{of bounds}} at the Clemson 44-yard line, and Virginia Tech's offense {{returned}} to the field. On the first play, Vick attempted a pass <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone.

5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Georgia Tech facing first down, in {{possession}} of the ball at the Clemson 18-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Dwyer gained 10 yards and a first down with a running play to the Clemson eight-yard line. Three plays later, Dwyer completed the Yellow Jackets' scoring drive with a run <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone.

5|$|Trailing by 11, {{and with}} time running down, Texas needed to score quickly. Brown threw an {{incomplete}} pass, then was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense. During the sack, Brown fumbled, {{and the ball}} {{was picked up by}} Virginia Tech's Jim Baron who returned it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone for a Virginia Tech defensive touchdown. The extra point was good, and Tech expanded its lead to 2810 with 5:06 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began its}} first full drive {{of the fourth}} quarter at its 41-yard line with 10:21 {{remaining}} in the game. Tech transitioned into a running strategy, maximizing {{the amount of time}} used off the game clock between each play. On the drive's first play, Stith was tackled for a one-yard loss. On its second play, Stith regained the lost yard. The third-down play was an incomplete pass by Clark, and the Hokies punted after going three and out. The kick rolled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone for a touchback, and Alabama's offense began at its 20-yard line. Alexander was tackled for a two-yard loss, then Zow threw an interception to Anthony Midget, who returned the ball all the way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone for a Virginia Tech defensive touchdown. The extra point was good, and Tech extended its lead to 387 with 7:33 remaining in the game.|$|E

Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort was converted to use as a caravan park the guard house was converted to an ablution block. A store and ablution block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall.|$|E

5|$|A one-yard rush was {{followed}} by a pass to running back Ken Oxendine that lost three yards. Following the negative-yardage play, North Carolina committed a five-yard penalty that gave the Hokies a third down and seven. Despite the extra yardage provided by the penalty, Clark's pass attempt on third down was incomplete and the Hokies again prepared to punt. During the kick, however, North Carolina defender Quinton Savage broke through the Virginia Tech offensive line and blocked the punt by Jimmy Kibble. Tar Heels' defender Dre Bly picked up the loose ball and ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone for North Carolina's second touchdown of the game. Following the play, North Carolina was penalized 15 yards for excessive celebration and the resulting 35-yard extra point kick was no good. Despite the missed kick, North Carolina extended its lead to 160 with 1:03 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|After Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff {{and a short}} return, Tennessee's offense {{started from}} its 31-yard line. A five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech was {{followed}} by a five-yard first-down run by Hardesty. Tennessee attempted to move its offense quickly in order to maximize the chances of closing Virginia Tech's lead by scoring fast. Crompton completed an 18-yard pass, advancing the Volunteers into Tech territory, but he was sacked by the Tech defense and Tennessee committed a five-yard false start penalty, forcing the Volunteers to punt. The kick rolled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone for a touchback, and Tech's offense returned to the field at its 20-yard line.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ball}} rolled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone for a touchback, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On {{the first play}} of the drive, Bryan Randall {{completed}} an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the extra point cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick {{in order to have}} a chance to get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free to run out the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to run out the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.|$|E
