40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{inhibitory}} effect of <b>Eucalyptus</b> globulus <b>oil</b> was evaluated against the E. coli and the {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) value of <b>Eucalyptus</b> globulus <b>oil</b> was calculated by agar dilution assay, which {{was found to be}} 1 Âµl/ml. The E. coli biofilm was formed on catheter surface and quantified by crystal violet staining system. The crystal violet quantification method showed maximum biofilm after 48 h. The effect of <b>Eucalyptus</b> globulus <b>oil</b> was evaluated against E. coli biofilm and was found to inhibit the biofilm by 62 %. To evaluate the effect of oil containing silica nanoparticle against biofilm system, the E. globulus oil was loaded in the silica nanoparticle. The synthesized nanoparticle (SNP) was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and data showed the average size of silica nanoparticle 1000 nm. The application of oil loaded silica nanoparticle was done against E coli biofilm system and biofilm quantification assay showed 81 % reduction in biofilm. The inhibition was further confirmed using light microscopic analysis of biofilm after staining with 0. 5 % crystal violet. The study is important which can be useful to use <b>Eucalyptus</b> globulus <b>oil</b> encapsulated inside the nanoparticle for its potential use in prevention and control of biofilm associated microbial infections and diseases.

40|$|Abstract Background In 1957, Tunisia {{introduced}} 117 {{species of}} Eucalyptus; {{they have been}} used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. Actually, <b>Eucalyptus</b> essential <b>oil</b> is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. A few investigations were reported on the biological activities of <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>oils</b> worldwide. In Tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. At that time {{it was not possible to}} evaluate their antimicrobial activities against clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. Methods The essential <b>oils</b> of eight <b>Eucalyptus</b> species harvested from the Jbel Abderrahman, Korbous (North East Tunisia) and Souinet arboreta (North of Tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. Results Twenty five components were identified by GC/FID and GC/MS. These components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. The chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. According to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % I, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>oils.</b> The cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within <b>Eucalyptus</b> species <b>oils.</b> Conclusions E. odorata showed the strongest activity against S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and against all the tested fungal strains. In addition, E. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. However, the best antiviral activity appeared with E. bicostata. Virus pretreatment with E. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (IC 50 [*]=[*] 0. 7 [*]mg/ml, SI[*]=[*] 22. 8) than cell-pretreatment (IC 50 [*]=[*] 4. 8 [*]mg/ml, SI[*]=[*] 3. 33). The essential oil of E. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. This activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of antibiotic resistant bacteria is of pressing concern {{as health care}} associated infections kill 99, 000 people {{a year in the}} U. S. alone. Researchers are currently looking for new antibiotics in alternative sources.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} the in vitro antimicrobial {{activity of the}} <b>Eucalyptus</b> globulus essential <b>oil,</b> and of the xylitol and papain substances against the following microorganisms: Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Samonella sp.; Staphylococus aureus; Proteus vulgaris; Escherichia coli and Candida albicans.

RESULTS The <b>Eucalyptus</b> globulus <b>oil</b> showed higher inhibition than chlorhexidine when applied to Staphylococcus aureus, and equal inhibition when applied to the following microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Candida albicans.

50|$|Around {{the turn}} of the 20th century, gold {{production}} began to diminish and a new form of employment was sought. The <b>eucalyptus</b> <b>oil</b> industry took hold when it was discovered that the leaves of the Blue Mallee, which grows abundantly around Inglewood but in few other places, produced some of the best quality <b>eucalyptus</b> <b>oil</b> in the world. In the early 20th century Inglewood became the centre for <b>eucalyptus</b> <b>oil</b> production in Victoria. The Valvoline Oil Company of the United States even had a distillery close to the town.

50|$|The Australian <b>eucalyptus</b> <b>oil</b> {{industry}} {{peaked in}} the 1940s, the main area of production being the central goldfields region of Victoria, particularly Inglewood; then the global establishment of eucalyptus plantations for timber resulted in increased volumes of <b>eucalyptus</b> <b>oil</b> as a plantation by-product.
