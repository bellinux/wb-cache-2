In 1901 he was awarded by the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry [...] "in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by {{the discovery of the}} laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions". After van 't Hoff, chemical kinetics deals with the experimental determination of reaction rates from which rate laws and rate constants are derived. Relatively simple rate laws exist for zero <b>order</b> <b>reactions</b> (for which reaction rates are independent of concentration), <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>reactions,</b> and second <b>order</b> <b>reactions,</b> and can be derived for others. Elementary reactions follow the law of mass action, but the rate law of stepwise reactions has to be derived by combining the rate laws of the various elementary steps, and can become rather complex. In consecutive reactions, the rate-determining step often determines the kinetics. In consecutive <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>reactions,</b> a steady state approximation can simplify the rate law. The activation energy for a reaction is experimentally determined through the Arrhenius equation and the Eyring equation. The main factors that influence the reaction rate include: the physical state of the reactants, the concentrations of the reactants, the temperature at which the reaction occurs, and whether or not any catalysts are present in the reaction.|$|R
