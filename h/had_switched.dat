5|$|Even though {{significant}} numbers of bus riders in Anacostia <b>had</b> <b>switched</b> to Metrorail by February 1992, WMATA nonetheless began running two- rather than four-car trains on the Green Line on Sundays and during slow periods in order to close a revenue shortfall.|$|E
5|$|For Browne and the Associated Press (AP), the {{pictures}} were a marketing success. Ray Herndon, the United Press International (UPI) correspondent who had forgotten to take his camera on the day, was harshly criticized in private by his employer.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the conflict, all naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean <b>had</b> <b>switched</b> to the trireme, a warship powered by three banks of oars. The most common naval tactics during the period were ramming (Greek triremes were equipped with a cast-bronze ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines. More experienced naval powers had by this time also begun to use a manoeuver known as diekplous. It is not clear what this was, but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.|$|E
5|$|Blackfish {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to Boonesborough and capture it, since it was now poorly defended, but Boone convinced him that {{the women and children}} were not hardy enough to survive a winter trek. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the following spring. Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly that many of his men concluded that he <b>had</b> <b>switched</b> his loyalty to the British.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Sanders and KFC used {{hydrogenated}} {{vegetable oil}} for frying, {{but in the}} 1980s the company began to switch to cheaper oils such as palm or soybean. In the 2000s {{it became apparent that}} these oils contain relatively high levels of trans fat, which increases the risk of heart disease. By April 2007, the chain <b>had</b> <b>switched</b> to trans fat-free soybean oil in all of its US outlets.|$|E

5|$|After a year's {{training}} at Gwelo under the Empire Air Training Scheme, Smith passed {{out with the}} rank of pilot officer in September 1942. He hoped to be stationed in Britain, but was posted to the Middle East instead; there he joined No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF, flying Hurricanes. In October 1943, in Egypt, Smith crashed his Hurricane after his throttle malfunctioned during a dawn takeoff. Suffering serious facial disfigurements, he also broke his jaw, leg and shoulder. Doctors and surgeons in Cairo rebuilt Smith's face through skin grafts and plastic surgery, and he was passed fit to fly again in March 1944. Turning down an offer to return to Rhodesia as an instructor, he rejoined No. 237 Squadron, which <b>had</b> <b>switched</b> to flying Spitfire Mk IXs, in Corsica in May 1944.|$|E
5|$|Because of Nintendo's solid {{infrastructure}} for the DS, Igarashi {{wanted to try}} the online components, and test for possible online game play, in future Castlevania titles. Igarashi commented the two player game play was homage to , his favorite Castlevania game. The anime style of artwork was retained from Dawn of Sorrow, which Igarashi <b>had</b> <b>switched</b> to in the previous title to appeal more to the younger demographics of the Nintendo handheld systems. Portrait of Ruins development cycle took roughly {{the same amount of}} time as Dawn of Sorrow did. Koji Igarashi stated that the schedule became tight due to Nintendo Wi-Fi difficulties, considering it was their first online enabled game.|$|E

5|$|Edzell was not {{affected}} by the campaigns of the Royalist Marquess of Montrose in the 1640s, although other properties of the Covenanting Presbyterian David Lindsay (son of Sir David), were attacked. During the Third English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell invaded Scotland and, in September 1651, his troops took Edzell, and were stationed there for one month. By {{the time of the}} Presbyterian settlement of 1689, the Lord of Edzell, David's son John Lindsay, <b>had</b> <b>switched</b> allegiances from Presbyterianism to Episcopalianism. Along with the parish minister, he was barred from the parish church, and Episcopal services were held in the great hall at Edzell.|$|E
5|$|Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958– June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He {{researched}} Mount St. Helens in the United States {{before and}} after its 1980 eruption, and blamed himself {{for the death of}} fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who <b>had</b> <b>switched</b> shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{video game}} website GameSpot {{reported}} that Duke Nukem Forever <b>had</b> <b>switched</b> to the Doom 3 engine. Many gaming news sites mailed Broussard, {{asking him to}} confirm or deny the rumor. After receiving no answer from him, they published the rumor as fact, but Broussard explicitly denied the rumor soon after. Soon after 3D Realms replaced the game's Karma physics system with one designed by Meqon, a relatively unknown Swedish firm. Closed-doors demonstrations of the technology suggested that the physics of Duke Nukem Forever would be a step up from the critically acclaimed Half-Life 2. Rumors suggested that the game would appear at 2005 E3. While 3D Realms' previously canceled Prey made an appearance, the rumors of Duke Nukem Forevers appearance proved false.|$|E

Around {{the start of the}} race, weather conditions were sunny, between , and no rain was expected. Gusty winds from the north created strong headwinds on the back straight. Kenny Farmer, chaplain of Las Vegas Motor Speedway, began pre-race ceremonies with an invocation. Actress Carol Linnae Johnson of the stage production Mamma Mia! performed the national anthem, and John Byers, co-director of UAW-Chrysler National Training Center, commanded the drivers to start their engines.

Instead of sleeping in the bedroom, he decides to sleep downstairs in an easy chair and watch pornography. When he is awoken by Joanne, he mumbles Scully's name. While changing his clothes, Mulder receives {{a telephone call from}} Smoodge, who explains that the military has surveyed the wreckage of the craft from the night before, finding one of the human pilots merged into a rock but still alive. Another soldier, Captain Robert McDonough, <b>had</b> <b>switched</b> bodies with an elderly Hopi woman, as evident from McDonough's aberrant behavior.|$|E
