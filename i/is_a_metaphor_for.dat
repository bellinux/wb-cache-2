5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape to a place where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its twists and turns, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> Tenar's exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E

25|$|It was {{composed}} in the 16th century by Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz, {{who was born}} in Thessaloniki and later became a Safed Kabbalist. As was common at the time, the song is also an acrostic, with the first letter of the first eight stanzas spelling the author's name. The author draws from the rabbinic interpretation of Song of Songs in which the maiden <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> the Jews and the lover (dod) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> God, and from Nevi'im, which uses the same metaphor. The poem shows Israel asking God to bring upon that great Shabbat of Messianic deliverance. It is one of the latest of the Hebrew poems regularly accepted into the liturgy, both in the southern use, which the author followed, and in the more distant northern rite.|$|E

25|$|Like Methuselah in Judaism, Bhishma {{among the}} Hindus is {{believed}} to have lived to a very advanced age and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> immortality. His life spans four generations and considering that he fought for his great-nephews in the Mahabharata War who were themselves in their 70s and 80s, it is estimated that Bhishma must have been between 130 and 370 {{years old at the time}} of his death.|$|E

Diwali is the celebration of this inner light over spiritual darkness, of knowledge over ignorance and right over wrong.

25|$|Their {{first attempt}} ends up recreating (after a liberal {{interpretation}} of the results) the Mary Magdalene conspiracy theory central to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Casaubon jokingly suggests that to create something truly new Belbo must look for occult connections in non-obvious contexts, such as by linking the Kabbalah to a car's spark plugs. (Belbo actually does this, and after some research concludes that the powertrain <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> the Tree of life.) Pleased {{with the results of}} the random text program, the three continue resorting to Abulafia whenever they reach a dead-end with their game.|$|E

Its lyrics address subject matter such as depression, self-worth, social networking, homophobia and domestic violence. It also encompasses themes of sexuality, including BDSM, masturbation, sexual orientation and same-sex relationships. Due to its sexually explicit content, the album reinforced Jackson's public image as a sex symbol and {{as one of the most}} erotic vocalists of the 1990s. Its incorporation of social issues regarding sexual orientation and combating homophobia also established her reputation as a gay icon and received a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music.|$|E

500|$|Reviewer Ian Watson {{states that}} the Athshean forest itself <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> {{consciousness}} in the novel. The Terrans, distanced from their own tangled subconscious, are afraid of the forest, and seek to tear it down. The Athsheans, in contrast, are integrated with it at a subconscious level. The entire forest is also seen as a collective Athshean consciousness. Although the forest in The Word for World is Forest is not actually sentient, Le Guin explores {{the idea of a}} sentient forest further in the short story [...] "Vaster than Empires and More Slow", which shares many thematic parallels with the former.|$|E

500|$|Den Shewman of Creative Screenwriting {{says the}} film asks how far one {{would go to}} devote oneself to an art. The {{character}} of Chung Ling Soo, according to Shewman, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> this theme. Film critic Alex Manugian refers to this theme as the [...] "meaning of commitment." [...] For example, Soo's pretense of being slow and feeble misdirects his audience from noticing the physical strength required to perform the goldfish bowl trick, {{but the cost of}} maintaining this illusion is the sacrifice of individuality: Soo's true appearance and freedom to act naturally are consciously suppressed in his ceaseless dedication to the art of magic.|$|E
500|$|Instruments {{played in}} the song include a guitar and piano, the latter of which has an F2-Eb5 range in {{scientific}} pitch notation. Jackson's vocal range on the track is C3-Bb5 and aspects of the song are performed in the key F minor. Genres that {{have been attributed to}} the song are dance, funk and new jack swing. Jackson incorporates many of the vocal traits associated with his work, such as hiccups and gasps. Neil Strauss of The New York Times suggests that the predatory woman in the title track, [...] "Susie", <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> AIDS. However, in an interview with Adrian Grant, Jackson denied that the song was about AIDS.|$|E

Despite the story's analogies to her own life, Niffenegger has forcefully stated that Clare is not a self-portrait; [...] "She's radically different.
