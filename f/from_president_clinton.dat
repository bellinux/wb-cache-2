500|$|On July 2, 1993, the White House {{issued its}} own 80-page {{report on the}} firings, one that the New York Times termed [...] "strikingly self-critical". [...] Co-written by Chief of Staff McLarty, it criticized five White House officials, {{included}} McLarty himself, Watkins, Kennedy, Cornelius, and another, for dismissing the Travel Office members improperly, for appearing to pressure the FBI into its involvement, and for allowing friends of the Clintons {{to become involved in}} a matter with which they had a business stake. [...] It said that the employees should instead have been placed on administrative leave. [...] However, the White House said no illegal actions had occurred, and no officials would be terminated; this did not satisfy Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, who called for an independent investigation. [...] As Chief of Staff McLarty personally apologized to the fired Travel Office employees — some of whom had all their personal documents and travel photographs related to years of service thrown out during the firing process — and said they would be given other jobs (which five of them were; Dale and his assistant director retired.) [...] The White House report also contained the initial indications of the First Lady's involvement in the firings, saying that she had taken an interest in the Travel Office's alleged mismanagement and had been informed two days in advance that the firings would take place. [...] There was no indication of involvement <b>from</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> himself, although he had earlier taken broad public responsibility for what had happened.|$|E

2500|$|In his book, The Oslo Syndrome, Harvard Medical School {{professor}} of psychiatry and historian Kenneth Levin summarized {{the failure of the}} 2000 Camp David Summit in this manner: [...] "espite the dimensions of the Israeli offer and intense pressure <b>from</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton,</b> Arafat demurred. [...] He apparently was indeed unwilling, no matter what the Israeli concessions, to sign an agreement that declared itself final and forswore any further Palestinian claims." [...] Levin argues that both the Israelis and the Americans were naive in expecting that Arafat would agree to give up the idea of a literal [...] "right of return" [...] for all Palestinians into Israel proper no matter how many 1948 refugees or how much monetary compensation Israel offered to allow.|$|E

Now, I {{have no idea how}} an 80 year old guy finds a vein, but {{he knew what he was}} doing. So we're all laying around high and stuff and then I notice in the pile of mail on the coffee table that there's a letter from the White House. I said 'Hey, this looks important.' and he replies 'Nah, it's probably just junk mail.' Well, I open the letter and it's <b>from</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, do you have any idea how big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was." ...|$|E
