500|$|Champion {{held out}} for several hours, {{wounding}} three of the vigilantes, and {{was said to have}} killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> so we could watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} Beyoncé as the female protagonist singing about {{her love for}} the [...] "huge ego" [...] of her lover. Jay Lustig of New Jersey On-Line further noted that the song may be an insight into Beyoncé's marriage to Jay-Z. In an interview with Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, Beyoncé clarified that [...] "Ego" [...] is on the Sasha Fierce disc because it is [...] "fun" [...] and very [...] "Sasha Fierce". She further explained that [...] "Ego" [...] reveals the story about someone being [...] "very confident and having [...] swagger when they walk and when they talk, and that {{being one of the}} reasons why [...] attracted to them." [...] The song explores the restrained vocals of Beyoncé singing [...] "I talk like this, cos I can back it up" [...] and consists of a piano breakdown. As Beyoncé sings, she lets out a slinky snarl in her voice. She describes the ego of her love interest as: [...] "It’s too big, it’s too wide, it’s too strong, it won’t fit, it’s too much." [...] The remix of the song features Kanye West rapping on it. He sings the lines, [...] "Now I’m standing next to Jay, who's standing next to B / Could have been anywhere in the world, but you're <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> / That's good for my ego... My ego is my imaginary friend / He was with me when I was only imagining." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Sacrifice", {{the first}} song of the album, {{contains}} [...] "rumbling guitars" [...] and a string section according to IGNs Ed Thompson. The main theme of the song is recovery from an abusive relationship, which also inspired all of the songs on Fallen. Jordan Reimer of The Daily Princetonian and Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said the song was written for Evanescence's former guitarist Ben Moody. [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] is a rock song that starts as a piano ballad before quickly becoming an alternative metal song that uses elements of nu metal, symphonic rock and pop music. Lee said she wrote the song for her ex-boyfriend Shaun Morgan of South African alternative metal band Seether. Described as a [...] "chick anthem", the song's protagonist explains the reasons {{the relationship between the}} pair will not work through the lyrics [...] "Don't cry to me…If you loved me, you would be <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> /...How could I have burned paradise? How could I…you were never mine". [...] "Weight of the World" [...] is a mixture of pop and metal, according to Stornoway Gazette. Inspired by the pressures of fame, it contains [...] "Eastern motifs" [...] and [...] "distorted vocals" [...] in the opening lines [...] "Feels like {{the weight of the world}} / Like God in heaven gave me a turn / Don't cling to me, I swear I can't fix you" [...] and in the chorus, [...] "If you love me, then let go of me / I won't be held down by who I used to be".|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Madonna has been {{involved}} in writing and producing most of her own music. Stuart Price, who worked on Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), said that [...] "You don't produce Madonna, you collaborate with her. She's a really good producer herself and obviously a great writer too. She has her vision and knows how to get it." [...] Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. According to author Carol Gnojewski, her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation, as Madonna said: [...] "I don't know where [...] came from. It was like magic. I'd write a song every day. I said 'Wow, I was meant to do this'." [...] Madonna later became the sole writer of five songs on her debut album, including [...] "Lucky Star" [...] which she composed on synthesizer. Rolling Stone has named her [...] "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics." [...] According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing [...] "incredible" [...] hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and its line [...] "Live out your fantasy <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> just let the music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, now I know you're mine." [...] Though Madonna has worked with producers across many genres, her songs have been consistently stamped with her own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail. Some of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre, which led to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars. Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame three times, for 2014, 2016 and 2017 ceremony. Rolling Stone listed Madonna at number 56 on the [...] "100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time".|$|E
2500|$|The song a midtempo ballad {{in which}} Alexander {{reflects}} on a past relationship and wonders why his girlfriend left him, eventually concluding that someday he'll know the answer. Rolling Stone called the song [...] "reflective," [...] while Consequence of Sound {{commented that the}} song is [...] "relatable to the ever-been-broken-hearted with lines like 'I’m speeding by the place that I met you for the 97th time tonight' and 'If I could ask God just one question: Why aren’t you <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> tonight?” ...|$|E
2500|$|Pabst {{was active}} in Philadelphia's large German-American community, and {{sponsored}} other emigrants, [...] "taking them into his household while they were studying and learning their way in the new country." [...] He {{was a member of}} the German Society of Pennsylvania, which published poems by him. He saw his heritage as integral to his success: [...] "I brought all of Germany <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> in my inward eye. The tall towers of Cologne, the wonders of Frankfurt-on-Main, the old grey castles perched in mid-air along the Rhine—they were all part of my work." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1977, Diamond {{released}} I'm Glad You're <b>Here</b> <b>With</b> <b>Me</b> Tonight, including [...] "You Don't Bring Me Flowers", {{for which}} he composed the music and on the writing of whose lyrics he collaborated with Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman. Barbra Streisand covered the song on her Songbird album, and later, a Diamond-Streisand duet, spurred {{by the success of}} radio mash-ups, was recorded. That version hit No. 1 in 1978, his third song to top the Hot 100. They appeared unannounced for the Grammy awards ceremony in 1980, where they performed a duet of the song to a surprised and rapturous audience.|$|E
2500|$|A month later, LaRouche held a {{press conference}} to accuse the Soviet government, British government, drug dealers, {{international}} bankers, and journalists of being involved in a variety of conspiracies. Flanked by bodyguards, he said, [...] "If Abe Lincoln were alive, he'd probably be standing up <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> today," [...] {{and that there was no}} criticism of him that did not originate [...] "with the drug lobby or the Soviet operation ..." [...] He said he had been in danger from Soviet assassins for over 13 years, and had to live in safe houses. He refused to answer a question from an NBC reporter, saying [...] "How can I talk with a drug pusher like you?" [...] He called the leadership of the United States [...] "idiotic" [...] and [...] "berserk," [...] and its foreign policy [...] "criminal or insane." [...] He warned of the imminent collapse of the banking system and accused banks of laundering drug money. Asked about the movement's finances, he said [...] "I don't know. ... I'm not responsible, I'm not involved in that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{song was}} then {{reworked}} by Nolan Lambroza who increased its tempo. Initially, {{there was no}} plan for the song to feature another artist. A fan of hip hop, Gomez felt constrained from incorporating the genre and collaborating with rappers on her previous released due to her age and young fanbase. However, for her second album, she reconsidered. Also a fan of R, the singer noticed that [...] "Good for You" [...] shared similarities to the genres, specifically in tempo and {{felt that it was}} the sound the song should have. At the time, she was also a fan of rapper ASAP Rocky's 2015 album At. Long. Last. A$AP — whose love she cited as [...] "influent" [...] in her decision to collaborate with him —, and thought [...] "Good for You" [...] had a vibe that was suited to Rocky's music. The rapper's participation happened organically; Gomez texted Rocky and sent him the song after receiving his contact details through Lambroza and her management. Rocky responded positively, having [...] "literally loved" [...] it and recording a verse the next day at Downtown Studios in New York City, New York. His vocals were produced by frequent collaborator Hector Delgado. This was the first time Gomez had collaborated with a rapper on one of her tracks. She also insisted that Rocky should experiment with the song beyond a rap verse. Consequently, he and Delgado co-produced it and added beats, instruments, as well additional bass and snares. Although this is a pop song, Rocky still used the same production process from his music. In an interview for MTV News, he explained: [...] "You just go in. Go for the kill. I mean, it wasn't the type of song you try to go into... It was just like me telling her, you sure you wanna go <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>me?</b> I gotta change the beat. I gotta talk my shit. My jiggy shit". Talking about Rocky's contribution, Gomez said: [...] "I was totally prepared for a 'No, I'm good, thank you', it was so great and he changed some of the production of the song, which made it better, and I let him have like full-on freedom with everything, it was really fun".|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, Jones {{released}} his last proper studio album on Epic, You Oughta Be <b>Here</b> <b>With</b> <b>Me.</b> [...] Although the album featured several stirring performances, including the lead single [...] "Hell Stays Open All Night Long" [...] and the Roger Miller-penned title song, the single did poorly and Jones made {{the switch to}} MCA, ending his relationship with Sherrill and what was now Sony Music after 19 years. [...] His first album with MCA, And Along Came Jones, was released in 1991 and, backed by MCA's powerful promotion team and producer Kyle Lehning (who had produced a string of hit albums for Randy Travis), the album sold better than his previous one had. [...] However, two singles, [...] "You Couldn't Get The Picture" [...] and [...] "She Loved A Lot In Her Time" [...] (a tribute to Jones' mother Clara), did not crack the top 30 on the charts as Jones lost favor with country radio as the format was altered radically during the early 1990s. [...] His last album to have significant radio airplay was 1992's Walls Can Fall, which featured the novelty song [...] "Finally Friday" [...] and [...] "I Don't Need Your Rockin' Chair," [...] a testament to his continued vivaciousness in old age. [...] Despite the lack of radio airplay, Jones continued to record and tour throughout the 1990s and {{was inducted into the}} Country Music Hall of Fame by Randy Travis in 1992. [...] In 1996, Jones {{released his}} autobiography I Lived To Tell It All with Tom Carter and the irony of his long career was not lost on him, with the singer writing in its preface, [...] "I also {{know that a lot of}} my show-business peers are going to be angry after reading this book. [...] So many have worked so hard to maintain their careers. [...] I never took my career seriously, and yet it's flourishing." [...] He also pulled no punches about his disappointment in the direction country music had taken, devoting a full chapter to the changes in the country music scene of the 1990s that saw him removed from radio playlists in favor of a younger generation of pop-influenced country stars. (Jones had long been a critic of country pop, and along with Wynette and Jean Shepard, he was one of the major backers of the Association of Country Entertainers, a guild promoting traditional country sounds that was founded in 1974; Jones's divorce from Wynette was a factor in the Association's collapse.) Despite his absence from the country charts during this time, latter-day country superstars such as Garth Brooks, Randy Travis, Alan Jackson, and many others often paid tribute to Jones while expressing their love and respect for his legacy as a true country legend who paved the way for their own success. [...] On February 17, 1998, The Nashville Network premiered a group of television specials called The George Jones Show, with Jones as host. [...] The program featured informal chats with Jones holding court with country's biggest stars old and new and, of course, music. [...] Guests included Loretta Lynn, Trace Adkins, Johnny Paycheck, Lorrie Morgan, Merle Haggard, Billy Ray Cyrus, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Charley Pride, Bobby Bare, Patty Loveless and Waylon Jennings, among others.|$|E
