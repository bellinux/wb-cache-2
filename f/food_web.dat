5|$|Food webs {{are often}} limited {{relative}} to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from <b>food</b> <b>web</b> microcosm studies are extrapolated to larger systems. Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which {{can be difficult to}} decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a <b>food</b> <b>web.</b> Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|A <b>food</b> <b>web</b> is {{the archetypal}} {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar energy {{and use it}} to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex <b>food</b> <b>web.</b> Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.|$|E
5|$|Dioxins from Agent Orange have {{persisted in}} the Vietnamese {{environment}} since the war, settling {{in the soil}} and sediment and entering the food chain through animals and fish which feed in the contaminated areas. The movement of dioxins through the <b>food</b> <b>web</b> has resulted in bioconcentration and biomagnification. The areas most heavily contaminated with dioxins are former U.S. air bases.|$|E
25|$|Within these categories, <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> can {{be further}} {{organized}} according to {{the different kinds of}} ecosystems being investigated. For example, human <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> agricultural <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> detrital <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> marine <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> aquatic <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> soil <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> Arctic (or polar) <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> terrestrial <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> and microbial <b>food</b> <b>webs.</b> These characterizations stem from the ecosystem concept, which assumes that the phenomena under investigation (interactions and feedback loops) are sufﬁcient to explain patterns within boundaries, such as the edge of a forest, an island, a shoreline, or some other pronounced physical characteristic.|$|R
40|$|Ecologists always meet complex <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> without clear {{hierarchical}} structure. At {{certain degree}} it will retard further analysis of <b>food</b> <b>webs.</b> In present study we transferred chaotic <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> into hierarchicalized <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> using Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM). As an example, the hierarchical structure of seven <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> was clearly identified and defined using ISM. ISM was thus {{proven to be}} effective...|$|R
5000|$|While they cannot {{characterize}} all interactions, soil <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> {{remain a}} useful tool for describing ecosystems. The interactions between species in the soil and their effect on decomposition continue to be well studied. Much remains unknown, however, about soil <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> stability and how <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> change over time. [...] This knowledge is critical to understanding how <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> affect important qualities such as soil fertility.|$|R
5|$|Frogs are primary {{predators and}} an {{important}} part of the <b>food</b> <b>web.</b> Being cold-blooded, they make efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into biomass. They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates, most of which feed on plants. By reducing herbivory, they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|There {{are reasons}} that seamounts are biologically important. They rise {{high in the}} water column, {{creating}} complex current patterns that support life on, around, and above the seamount. The surface of the seamount also provides a substrate upon which organisms can attach themselves and grow. This in turn supports the species that feed on them, in turn supporting the whole ecological <b>food</b> <b>web.</b> Scientists have found that seamounts often provide a habitat for endemic species that are not found anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other <b>food</b> <b>web</b> connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.|$|E
40|$|<b>Food</b> <b>webs,</b> {{describing}} the links among consumers and their prey in ecological communities, {{have a long}} history of study in ecology dating back to Charles Elton’s research in the 1920 s [1, 2]. Subsequently, however, experimental work on <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> has focused within habitats on the effects of species interactions (e. g. competition and predation) and physical factors (e. g. disturbance) on community composition and dynamics through time [3]. By contrast, food-web theory largely addressed architectural features of published <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> (connectance, species richness and food-chain length) that influenced system stability in models [4 – 7]. In the 1990 s, a renaissance occurred in research on <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> as better empirical data describing highly resolved <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> emerge...|$|R
40|$|Soil <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> {{influence}} {{organic matter}} mineralization and plant nutrient availability, {{but the potential}} for plants to capitalize on these processes by altering soil <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> has received little attention. We compared soil <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> beneath C 3 - and C 4 -grass plantings by measuring bacterial and fungal biomass and protozoan and nematode abundance repeatedly over 2 years. We tested published expectations that C 3 detritus and root chemistry (low lignin/N) favor bacterial-based <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> and root-feeding nematodes, whereas C 4 detritus (high lignin/N) and greater production favor fungal decomposers and predatory nematodes. We also hypothesized that seasonal differences in plant growth between the two grassland types would generate season-specific differences in soil <b>food</b> <b>webs.</b> In contrast to our expectations, bacterial biomass and ciliate abundance were greater beneath C 4 grasses, and we found no differences in fungi, amoebae, flagellates, or nematodes. Soil <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> varied significantly among sample dates, but differences were unrelated to aboveground plant growth. Our findings, in combination with previous work, suggest that preexisting soil properties moderate the effect of plant inputs on soil <b>food</b> <b>webs.</b> We hypothesize that high levels of soil organic matter provide a stable environment and energy source for soil organisms and thus buffer soil <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> from short-term dynamics of plant communities...|$|R
40|$|I use {{numerical}} {{and analytical}} techniques {{to study the}} dynamics of various models of plankton <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> with and without resource fluctuations. Plankton are ideal organisms because they are very small, fast-reproducing organisms so they can easily be used in lab-oratory experiments to verify any results. We can study simple <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> to develop {{a better understanding of}} more complex <b>food</b> <b>webs.</b> The three archetypical <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> are a single grazer with a resource (growth), multiple grazers with a common resource (competition), and one grazer and one predator with a base resource (predator-prey). ...|$|R
5|$|Allosaurus was {{the most}} common large {{theropod}} in the vast tract of Western American fossil-bearing rock known as the Morrison Formation, accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens, and as such was at the top trophic level of the Morrison <b>food</b> <b>web.</b> The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.|$|E
5|$|DDT {{pollution}} in the environment was {{a major cause of}} decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic <b>food</b> <b>web,</b> contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican’s primary food fish – the northern anchovy. Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive toxicant in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.|$|E
5|$|Food webs exhibit {{principles}} of ecological emergence through {{the nature of}} trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). Theoretical and empirical studies identify non-random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases <b>food</b> <b>web</b> stability. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.|$|E
50|$|Mathematical {{modeling}} in <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> {{has raised}} the question of whether complex or simple <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> are more stable. Until the last decade, it was believed that soil <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> were relatively simple, with low degrees of connectance and omnivory. These ideas stemmed from the mathematical models of May which predicted that complexity destabilized <b>food</b> <b>webs.</b> May used community matrices in which species were randomly linked with random interaction strength to show that local stability decreases with complexity (measured as connectance), diversity, and average interaction strength among species.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Food</b> <b>webs</b> are the road-maps through Darwin's famous 'entangled bank' {{and have}} a long history in ecology. Like maps of {{unfamiliar}} ground, <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> appear bewilderingly complex. They were often published to make just that point. Yet recent studies have shown that <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> {{from a wide range of}} terrestrial, freshwater, and marine communities share a remarkable list of patterns.|$|R
40|$|If the trophic niche {{of a kind}} of {{organism}} is a connected {{region in}} niche space, then it is possible for trophic niche overlaps to be described in a one-dimensional niche space if and only if the trophic niche overlap graph is an interval graph. An analysis of 30 <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> using the combinatorial theory of interval graphs, suggests that a niche space of dimension 1 suffices, with unexpectedly high frequency and perhaps always, to describe the trophic niche overlaps implied by real <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> in single habitats. Consequently, real <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> fall in a small subset of the set of mathematically possible <b>food</b> <b>webs.</b> That real <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> are compatible with one-dimensional trophic niche spaces, more often than can be explained by chance alone, has not been noticed previously...|$|R
5|$|Like mayflies, {{stoneflies}} and dragonflies, but to {{a somewhat}} lesser extent, caddisflies are an indicator of good water quality; they die out of streams with polluted waters. They {{are an important part}} of the <b>food</b> <b>web,</b> both larvae and adults being eaten by many fish. The newly hatched adult is particularly vulnerable as it struggles to the surface after emerging from the submerged pupa, and as it dries its wings. The fish find these new adults easy pickings, and fishing flies resembling them can be successful for anglers at the right time of year.|$|E
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal <b>food</b> <b>web</b> for soft tissue digestion. The same could be said for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{typically}} {{lay their}} eggs in water. The eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills. They have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous, omnivorous or planktivorous diets. The life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators {{and part of the}} <b>food</b> <b>web</b> dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is semi-permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in their breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviours to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.|$|E
50|$|But why {{are complex}} <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> more stable? Many of the {{barriers}} to top-down trophic cascades also promote stability. Complex <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> may be more stable if the interaction strengths are weak and soil <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> appear to consist of many weak interactions and a few strong ones. Donor controlled <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> may be inherently more stable, because {{it is difficult for}} primary consumers to overtax their resources. The structure of the soil also acts as a buffer, separating organisms and preventing strong interactions. Many soil organisms, for example bacteria, can remain dormant through difficult times and reproduce quickly once conditions improve, making them resilient to disturbance.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Food</b> <b>webs</b> can be {{controlled}} by bottom-up or top-down forces, which dictate whether a <b>food</b> <b>web’s</b> structure and population dynamics are regulated by nutrients (a supply of fixed carbon) and primary production or by top predators, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Our mothers {{teach us}} to grill our meats “well done” and chew them thoroughly. Even if mom {{did not know}} why she insisted, both are good {{precautions}} against parasites. Parasites may be in our food, but they are not in our <b>food</b> <b>webs.</b> Is it necessary to take the precaution of considering them? In this chapter, we argue that parasites affect important properties of <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> and that {{it may be difficult to}} fully understand ecosystems without considering parasites. <b>Food</b> <b>webs</b> depict trophic interactions among networks of consumers, producers, and non-living material. Units in <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> range from specific life-cycle stages of species to broad taxonomic/ functional groups. At the most basic level, <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> are static diagrams or matrices of who eats whom (topological <b>webs).</b> Some <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> track flows of energy and matter among links (bioenergetic <b>webs).</b> Other <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> denote the strengths of interactions among species (interaction webs). The food-web framework captures much of the current theory on how habitat heterogeneity, species richness, trophic cascades, indirect mutualism, apparent competition, intraguild predation, environmental change, ecosystem stability, nutrient dynamics, and productivity affect community structure (Paine 1988; Winemiller and Polis 1996). <b>Food</b> <b>webs</b> also aid applied research by providing a better understanding of pest control, environmental contamination, bioremediation, and fisheries management (Winemiller and Polis 1996). Published <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> vary considerably in quality and detail, but nearly all exclude consumers that are not readily detectable, such as endoparasites and other infectious agents (Polis 1991; Cohen et al. 1993). Indeed, perhaps because they are difficult to detect, typical parasites have been historically lacking from the bulk of ecological theory. However, parasitism is arguably the most prevalent lifestyle among animals (Price 1980; DeMeeûs and Renaud 2002). As ecologists increasingly consider the role of parasites in ecosystems, it is becoming clear that parasites are embedded in <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> and may need to be considered in food-web theory (Polis 1991; Cohen et al...|$|R
5|$|Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are {{commonly}} cited {{as an example}} of a keystone species; because, they limit the density of sea urchins that feed on kelp. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure. Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas). While the keystone species concept has been used extensively as a conservation tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, <b>food</b> <b>web</b> theory suggests that keystone species may not be common, so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be applied.|$|E
5|$|While Hesperornis is {{not thought}} to have left descendants, the {{earliest}} modern seabirds also occurred in the Cretaceous, with a species called Tytthostonyx glauconiticus, which seems allied to the Procellariiformes and Pelecaniformes. In the Paleogene the seas were dominated by early Procellariidae, giant penguins and two extinct families, the Pelagornithidae and the Plotopteridae (a group of large seabirds that looked like the penguins). Modern genera began their wide radiation in the Miocene, although the genus Puffinus (which includes today's Manx shearwater and sooty shearwater) might {{date back to the}} Oligocene. The highest diversity of seabirds apparently existed during the Late Miocene and the Pliocene. At the end of the latter, the oceanic <b>food</b> <b>web</b> had undergone a period of upheaval due to extinction of considerable numbers of marine species; subsequently, the spread of marine mammals seems to have prevented seabirds from reaching their erstwhile diversity.|$|E
5|$|The Morrison Formation records a {{time when}} the local {{environment}} was dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs. Dinosaurs known from the Morrison Formation include the theropods Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Ornitholestes, Saurophaganax, and Torvosaurus; the sauropods Brontosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus; and the ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, and Stegosaurus. Apatosaurus is commonly found at the same sites as Allosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, and Stegosaurus. Allosaurus accounted for 70–75% of theropod specimens and was at the top trophic level of the Morrison <b>food</b> <b>web.</b> Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are of the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks of the Lourinhã Formationmainly Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, and Torvosaurusor have a close counterpartBrachiosaurus and Lusotitan, Camptosaurus and Draconyx, and Apatosaurus and Dinheirosaurus. Other vertebrates that are known to have shared this paleo-environment include ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans, and several species of pterosaur. Shells of bivalves and aquatic snails are also common. The flora of the period has been evidenced in fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of tree ferns with fern understory (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.|$|E
40|$|Networks from a {{wide range}} of physical, biological, and social systems have been {{recently}} described as “small-world” and “scale-free. ” However, studies disagree whether ecological networks called <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> possess the characteristic path lengths, clustering coefficients, and degree distributions required for membership in these classes of networks. Our analysis suggests that the disagreements are based on selective use of relatively few <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> as well as analytical decisions that obscure important variability in the data. We analyze a broad range of 16 high-quality <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> with 25 – 172 nodes, from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. <b>Food</b> <b>webs</b> generally have much higher complexity, measured as connectance (the fraction of all possible links that are realized in a network), and much smaller size than other networks studied, which have important implications for network topology. Our results resolve prior conflicts by demonstrating that although some <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> have small-world and scale-free structure, most do not if they exceed a relatively low level of connectance. Although food-web degree distributions do not display a universal functional form, observed distributions are systematically related to network connectance and size. Also, although <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> often lack small-world structure because of low clustering, we identify a continuum of real-world networks including <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> whose ratios of observed to random clustering coefficients increase as a power–law function of network size over 7 orders of magnitude. Although <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> are generally not small-world, scale-free networks, food-web topology is consistent with patterns found within those classes of networks...|$|R
40|$|A goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} similarities in structure among <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> that are otherwise disparate with regard to species, population, and size. <b>Food</b> <b>webs</b> were examined as directed, unweighted graphs in order to normalize <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> with regard to biomass and population/species distinctions. The graphs were further normalized with regard to topological size and existence of circuits through the reduction of each strongly connected component to a single node. This had the added benefit of resulting in networks with more clear delineation between trophic levels. Finally, common induced subgraphs were considered for their obvious value in characterizing network structure. Through this study we determined not only that there are pairs of systems that are highly similar in structure once appropriately normalized for size, makeup, and geographical location, but also that a majority of <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> have similar structural components when compared with random <b>food</b> <b>webs.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Benthic diatoms {{are assumed}} to be of minor {{importance}} as food sources in sandy-beach <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> since they are typically scarce in sandy-beach sediments; whereas organic matter derived from land and sea is known to be more important in sandy-beach <b>food</b> <b>webs.</b> In order to test if benthic and planktonic diatoms play a minor or major role, respectively, in sandy-beach <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> a laboratory experiment was conducted. Labelled planktonic and benthic diatoms, enriched in the stable carbon 13 C isotope, were offered as food sources to sandy-beach macrofauna and meiofauna communities. Uptake of both types of diatoms occurred with most of the species, but benthic diatoms were preferentially consumed by two macrofaunal species and all meiofaunal species. This result reveals the importance of benthic carbon sources in both macrofaunal and interstitial <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> and suggests a link between both <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> through the common use of benthic diatoms...|$|R
5|$|Olson {{made many}} inferences on the paleoecology of the Texas Red beds {{and the role}} of Dimetrodon within its ecosystem. He {{proposed}} several main types of ecosystems in which the earliest tetrapods lived. Dimetrodon belonged to the most primitive ecosystem, which developed from aquatic food webs. In it, aquatic plants were the primary producers and were largely fed upon by fish and aquatic invertebrates. Most land vertebrates fed on these aquatic primary consumers. Dimetrodon was probably the top predator of the Red Beds ecosystem, feeding on a variety of organisms such as the large shark Xenacanthus, the aquatic amphibians Trimerorhachis and Diplocaulus, and the terrestrial tetrapods Seymouria and Trematops. Insects are known from the Early Permian Red Beds and were probably involved to some degree in the same <b>food</b> <b>web</b> as Dimetrodon, feeding small reptiles like Captorhinus. The Red Beds assemblage also included some of the first large land-living herbivores like Edaphosaurus and Diadectes. Feeding primarily on terrestrial plants, these herbivores did not derive their energy from aquatic food webs. According to Olson, the best modern analogue for the ecosystem Dimetrodon inhabited is the Everglades. The exact lifestyle of Dimetrodon (amphibious to terrestrial) has long been controversial, but bone microanatomy supports a terrestrial lifestyle, which implies that it would have fed mostly on land, on the banks, or in very shallow water. Evidence also exists for Dimetrodon preying on aestivating Diplocaulus during times of drought, with three partially eaten juvenile Diplocaulus in a burrow of eight bearing teeth marks from a Dimetrodon that unearthed and killed them.|$|E
25|$|Detritivores {{capitalize}} {{upon this}} energy source, creating an alternate and parallel <b>food</b> <b>web</b> of potentially large importance.

25|$|In 1927, Charles Elton {{published}} an influential synthesis {{on the use}} of food webs, which resulted in them becoming a central concept in ecology. In 1966, interest in food webs increased after Robert Paine's experimental and descriptive study of intertidal shores, suggesting that <b>food</b> <b>web</b> complexity was key to maintaining species diversity and ecological stability. Many theoretical ecologists, including Sir Robert May and Stuart Pimm, were prompted by this discovery and others to examine the mathematical properties of food webs. According to their analyses, complex food webs should be less stable than simple food webs. The apparent paradox between the complexity of food webs observed in nature and the mathematical fragility of <b>food</b> <b>web</b> models is currently an area of intensive study and debate. The paradox may be due partially to conceptual differences between persistence of a <b>food</b> <b>web</b> and equilibrial stability of a <b>food</b> <b>web.</b>|$|E
40|$|Recently {{the study}} of complex {{networks}} has received great attention.

In particular, comparison to other complex networks shows that <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> lack the scale-free properties observed in almost all other artificial and natural networks. That is, the frequency distribution for the degree (numer of different predators per species) does not display scale-free behavior. Nevertheless, we show here that self-similiar and universal behavior are still present. By considering <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> as transportation networks (for the flow of resources between species), we can recover scaling properties typical of other transportation system, such as vascular and river networks.

40|$|Biodiversity loss {{is one of}} {{the major}} threats to humanity. This has led to an {{increasing}} amount of research on biodiversity on genetic and species levels. Studies of diversity at the ecosystem level has however been neglected. An important aspect of ecosystems is <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> that describe the predation-prey interactions between species. Properties explaining the topological structure of <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> can be used to compare and highlight differences between ecosystems. In the present study, topological network properties are used to compare the diversity of network structures between groups of empirical <b>food</b> <b>webs.</b> Differences between 45 aquatic and 45 terrestrial <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> are compared as well as the effects of species richness on lake network structure diversity. Network structure diversity is measured as the average Euclidean distance from <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> to their group centroid in a multidimensional space of network properties. While the average network structure differs between aquatic and terrestrial <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> no significant difference in variation is found. For 128 Swedish and 48 North American lake <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> increasing species richness is shown to decrease network structure diversity.
