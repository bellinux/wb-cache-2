40|$|Job {{scheduling}} algorithm has {{a significant}} influence on grid computing performance. Characteristics of <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> resources {{to be used in}} evaluating the performance of the scheduling algorithm must reflect the dynamic nature of real grid environment. Static models of <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> resources cannot be used to generate <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> resources in simulating the grid environment because of the dynamic nature of the grid. This paper presents a new graph representation of <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> resources which is practical for hybrid metaheuristic model implementation such as ant colony optimization and genetic algorithm. A dynamic model that can generate <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> resources similar to the <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> resources in the real grid environment is also proposed. <b>Jobs</b> <b>and</b> resources may join in or drop out from the grid. Stochastic analysis is performed on the characteristics of <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> resources. A simulator based on the dynamic expected time to compute, has been developed and {{can be used as a}} benchmark. The simulator can generate <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> resources with the characteristics of <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> resources in the real grid environment. This will facilitates the evaluation of dynamic job scheduling algorithm...|$|R

Va-riables in this research were measured via a survey of 190 banking salespersons in D. I. Yogyakarta and Solo. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were used to examine the effects of job autonomy on work outcomes, job satisfaction on <b>job</b> performance, <b>and</b> <b>job</b> stress on job performance. Results showed that the estimated model in this research is acceptable based on its score of the goodness of fit index. The structural relationship showed that job autonomy significantly related to <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> performance, but not significant with job stress. It also showed that self efficacy partially mediated the relationship between <b>job</b> autonomy <b>and</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction, <b>and</b> <b>job</b> performance.
