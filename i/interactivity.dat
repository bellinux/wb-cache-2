5|$|Screensavers were {{designed}} {{to ensure that there}} would be no phosphor burn-in of images left on a CRT-based screen. Delrina added sound and basic <b>interactivity</b> with its series of screensaver products, arguably qualifying it as an early form of multimedia.|$|E
5|$|Ultima Underworld II began {{production}} in April 1992, {{shortly after the}} completion of Ultima Underworld; and it was developed in nine months. The team sought to improve upon the foundation laid by the game's predecessor, particularly by increasing the size and <b>interactivity</b> of the game world. The team reused and improved the first game's engine. Development was impeded by insufficient staffing and extensive playtesting, and the rapid production cycle led to burnout on the team.|$|E
5|$|A three-disc {{edition of}} Casino Royale on DVD was {{released}} in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2008, coinciding with the cinema release of the sequel, Quantum of Solace (the following week in the United States). As well as features present from the 2007 release, the collector's edition contains an audio commentary, deleted scenes, featurettes and a storyboard-to-film comparison. A two-disc Blu-ray version also followed in late 2008, featuring additional supplementary materials, enhanced <b>interactivity</b> through BD-Live, and the previous version's 5.1 PCM soundtrack was replaced with a similar 5.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|Chao have {{appeared}} in many games in the series, beginning with Sonic Adventure in 1998. They usually {{take the form of}} digital pets, but have also played parts in the story and figured into other gameplay elements. Most notably, the character Cream the Rabbit has a Chao named Cheese, whom she uses to attack enemies. They have also appeared in games outside the series, the Sonic the Hedgehog comics, and the Sonic X anime, as well as being featured in promotions and merchandise. Critics have given mixed opinions on Chao and their integration into Sonic gameplay, generally praising their worth as a diversion but criticizing Chao minigames' low <b>interactivity.</b>|$|E
5|$|End of Ages was {{positively}} received upon release. Despite complaints such as lessened <b>interactivity</b> compared to previous games and poorer graphics, publications including Macworld, Computer Gaming World, and The Washington Post judged the game a fitting {{end to the}} series. After End of Agess release, Cyan abruptly announced the end of software development and the layoff of most of its staff, but was able to rehire much of the development team a few weeks later. Including End of Agess sales, the Myst franchise had sold more than 12 million copies by November 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} adapted into a manga by Shiro Amano. The story follows {{the events that}} took place in the game with a few minor {{differences}} to account for the loss of <b>interactivity</b> a video game provides. Some events {{that took place in}} the Final Mix version were also included. The manga was originally serialized in Japan by Enterbrain's FamitsÅ« PS2, but has since been released worldwide in four volumes. The volumes have been published in English in the United States by Tokyopop. The first volume was released on October 11, 2005, and the fourth volume was released on July 10, 2006. The entire series was later released in a boxed set on October 10, 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} rather quickly as {{a sequel to}} the Nintendo 64 title Hey You, Pikachu! and to promote the Nintendo e-Reader accessory, and uses a novel 3D texturing effect. It was first showcased at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2003 and later through a month-long series of promotional events in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. It was released on July 18, 2003, in Japan, December 1 in North America, and April 2, 2004, in Europe. In Japan, the game sold 66,373 copies in its first year. It received mixed reviews, which generally criticized its low level of <b>interactivity</b> and repetitive sound effects, though its collecting aspects and visuals were somewhat better received.|$|E
5|$|The {{video games}} provide the {{canonical}} {{story of the}} series. The manga series is adapted by Shiro Amano and the novels are written by Tomoco Kanemaki and illustrated by Shiro Amano. The stories follow the events {{that take place in}} the video games with differences to account for the loss of <b>interactivity</b> that a video game provides. The manga and novel series are both divided up into three series based on each of the three main video games. Each series is further broken up into multiple volumes. The manga was originally serialized in Japan by Square's Monthly Shonen Gangan, but has since been released worldwide. The manga was released in the United States by Tokyopop near the end of 2005, but was discontinued in 2008.|$|E
5|$|According to John Carmack, {{the lead}} {{graphics}} engine developer at id Software, {{the technology of}} Doom 3 was supported by three primary features: unified lighting and shadowing, complex animations and scripting that showed real-time with fully dynamic per-pixel lighting and stencil shadowing, and GUI surfaces that add extra <b>interactivity</b> to the game. The key advance of the id Tech 4 graphics engine developed for Doom 3 is the unified lighting and shadowing. Rather than computing or rendering lightmaps during map creation and saving that information in the map data, most light sources are computed in real-time. This allows lights to cast shadows even on non-static objects such as monsters and machinery, which was impossible with static non-directional lightmaps. A shortcoming {{of this approach is}} the engine's inability to render soft shadows and global illumination.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, it was {{announced}} that VyRT would exclusively broadcast worldwide the performance scheduled on September 15 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. Sales for digital tickets began on September 3. VyRT provided access to several different experience packages featuring backstage <b>interactivity</b> with both bands and exclusive content. On September 15, before Thirty Seconds to Mars took to the stage, the VyRT platform was hacked and was a victim of a piracy. Jared Leto, founder of the streaming service, was forced to delay the performance by Thirty Seconds to Mars by an hour to resolve the issue. The audience eventually lost approximately three minutes of actual stage time, but the set list was shortened. The event included real-time social community engagement from audiences worldwide. A second broadcast of the show was later scheduled for September 17, 2014. The performance by Thirty Seconds to Mars became commercially available for download in October 2014 through VyRT. Footage recorded during the Carnivores Tour was uploaded to Linkin Park's official YouTube account.|$|E
5|$|The Last of Us: Left Behind {{is similar}} to the basic {{gameplay}} of The Last of Us. As such, it is an action-adventure survival horror game that uses a third-person perspective. The game involves gunfights, melee combat and a cover system. Players control Ellie. An added feature in combat is the ability to focus the attention of the Infected towards human enemies, by throwing objects to distract them. This results in a lower number of enemies to encounter, giving players a tactical advantage. Throughout the game, players encounter locations and activities around the mall, such as a carousel, photo booth, video arcade, mask store and water guns. All of these locations and activities have some level of <b>interactivity,</b> allowing players to use them in different ways; for example, the photo booth allows players to select different mannerisms in which to pose for a picture, while using the water guns prompts players to soak Riley.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} and graphics received positive reviews. Although IGN {{felt that the}} in-depth character traits in Final Fantasy IX could be generally found in other Final Fantasy games, it still found the characters to be engaging and sympathetic. GameSpot found the characters, up to their dialogue and traits, amusing and full of humor. IGN {{also noted that the}} Active Time Event system helps to expand the player's understanding of the characters' personalities as they question many ideas and emotions. Their semi-deformed appearance, which also covers monsters of every size, contain detailed animation and design. They gave praise to the pre-rendered backgrounds, noting the careful attention given to the artwork, movement in animations and character <b>interactivity.</b> The movies are seen as emotive and compelling, and the seamless transition and incorporation to the in-game graphics helped to move the plot well.|$|E
5|$|In land engagements, {{players have}} an 18th-century army {{consisting}} of units such as cavalry, musketeers, riflemen and artillery. Each {{has its own}} intrinsic advantages, disadvantages, cost, and overall effectiveness. Players must use 18th-century tactics and formations to defeat their enemies. The battlefield terrain and the weather are also important. Factions can lay siege to settlements, replacing open land battles with street fighting and close-quarter combat. Each unit has morale, which increases if the battle goes well, or decrease after heavy casualties, army losses, coming under artillery bombardment, or {{with the death of}} the general. Tactical situations such as attacking from a flank or the rear, or depriving a unit of allied reinforcements, also hit morale. When a unit's morale is sufficiently depleted, it will be routed and flee the battlefield. Depending on whether morale is merely broken or entirely shattered, the player may be able to rally the unit and regroup. Victory is achieved by causing every enemy unit to rout, or be annihilated. In addition, sieges can be won if the attacker manages {{to take control of the}} settlement's central square for a set amount of time. Empire: Total War also introduces several new battlefield elements to the Total War series. Units can take cover behind walls or in buildings, allowing increased <b>interactivity</b> with the terrain and making some buildings points of tactical importance. Field defences may be constructed on the battlefield. Infantry units can also scale small obstacles such as walls and fences. Each unit has different capabilities such as Square Formation, Wedge, Diamond, Equip bayonets, or Fire at will.|$|E
5|$|On 31 May 2012, a {{gameplay}} trailer {{was released}} online, showcasing more action-based gameplay along with varying plot elements. The trailer confirmed {{the presence of}} several other non-playable characters besides Lara on the island, many of which appear {{to be part of}} a menacing organization. On 4 June, at Microsoft's E3 2012 press conference, a new gameplay demonstration was shown, depicting environmental destruction and other <b>interactivity,</b> stealth combat using a bow and arrow, quick-time events and parachuting. During summer 2012, gameplay was shown of Lara hunting, exploring the island and killing for the first time. They were shown at Eurogamer Expo 2012 at London on 27 September. On 8 December, a new trailer was shown during Spike Video Game Awards. At the beginning, an introduction was made by Camilla Luddington and during the event, the trailer was followed by a musical orchestra, led by the music composer, Jason Graves. The next week, IGN presented: Tomb Raider Week. Each day from Monday to Friday, exclusive previews, features and trailers were released, showing more details for the upgrading system, survival tools and challenge tombs. Tomb Raider officially went gold on 8 February 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{tentatively}} titled Crash Team Racing 2 during its pre-production phase. The {{characters of the}} game were designed by series veteran Charles Zembillas, while the environments were designed by Joe Pearson (another veteran of the series), John Nevarez, Alan Simmons and Di Davies. The karts were designed by Perry Zombolis Jr. and Andy Lomerson. Recognizing that full motion video sequences have become the new norm in state-of-the-art video games, Universal Interactive decided that Crash Nitro Kart {{would be the first}} game in the Crash Bandicoot series to feature such cinematics. The cutscenes of Crash Nitro Kart were created by Red Eye Studios; pre-production of the cutscenes was handled by Epoch Ink. The screenplay of the cutscenes was written by Dan Tanguay. The studio's eight artists were given four months to create 32 minutes of pre-rendered cinematics. The actual animation phase was to be completed in 15 weeks, breaking down to almost five shots a day or 15 seconds of animation per day for each artist. The in-game versions of the character models were built using 3ds Max and were outfitted with full inverse kinematic setups, morph targets and UV texture maps by Vicarious Visions. These models could not be ported directly into the cinematics due to their lower resolution for optimal real-time <b>interactivity.</b> Instead, the artists of Red Eye Studios worked from concept sketches provided by Vicarious Visions and used Alias Systems' Maya (with which the artists were more familiar) to enhance the detail of the 27 character models in the game, including the Crash Bandicoot character.|$|E
25|$|<b>Interactivity</b> can be {{considered}} a central concept in understanding new media, but different media forms possess, or enable different degrees of <b>interactivity,</b> and some forms of digitized and converged media are not in fact interactive at all. Tony Feldman considers digital satellite television {{as an example of a}} new media technology that uses digital compression to dramatically increase the number of television channels that can be delivered, and which changes the nature of what can be offered through the service, but does not transform the experience of television from the user's point of view, and thus lacks a more fully interactive dimension. It remains the case that <b>interactivity</b> is not an inherent characteristic of all new media technologies, unlike digitization and convergence.|$|E
25|$|Hogfather won the <b>Interactivity</b> Award at the 2007 BAFTA TV Awards {{for its use}} of the {{interactive}} options available on digital television.|$|E
25|$|Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based {{vector image}} format for {{two-dimensional}} graphics with support for <b>interactivity</b> and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999.|$|E
25|$|When {{we think}} of <b>interactivity</b> and its meaning, we assume {{that it is only}} {{prominent}} in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does not allow us to see its existence in mediated communication forums. <b>Interactivity</b> is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of <b>interactivity</b> include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming. Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that we have today and {{there is no longer a}} limit to what we can do with our creativity.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in user created content and <b>interactivity</b> {{gives rise to}} issues {{of control over the}} game itself and ownership of the player-created content. This gives rise to fundamental legal issues, highlighted by Lessig and Bray and Konsynski, such as intellectual property and property ownership rights.|$|E
25|$|Apple dropped {{support for}} Flash content in QuickTime 7.3, {{breaking}} content that relied on Flash for <b>interactivity,</b> or animation tracks. Security concerns {{seem to be}} part of the decision. Flash flv files can still be played in QuickTime if the free Perian plugin is added.|$|E

25|$|At a Halloween {{party in}} 2000, Palmer met drummer Brian Viglione and {{afterwards}} they formed The Dresden Dolls. In {{an effort to}} expand the performance experience and <b>interactivity,</b> Palmer began inviting Lexington High School students to perform drama pieces at the Dresden Dolls' live shows. This evolved to The Dirty Business Brigade, a troupe of seasoned and new artists, performing at many gigs.|$|E
25|$|From 1994-1995 Iwai was an Artist-in-Residence at the ZKM (Center for Art and Media) in Karlsruhe, Germany. Around {{this time}} his work became {{increasingly}} {{focused on the}} relationship between sound and image, using <b>interactivity,</b> gestural interface and generative, interactive and aleatoric music. These interests are expressed in three key installation works, Resonance of 4, Piano - As Image Media and Composition on the Table.|$|E
25|$|An online {{extension}} of the series, Heroes 360 Experience, later rebranded as Heroes Evolutions, was created to explore the Heroes universe and provides insight into the show's mythology. Other official Heroes media include magazines, action figures, tie-in and interactive websites, a mobile game, a novel, clothing and other merchandise. In the fall of 2008, NBC Digital Entertainment released a series of online content for the summer, including more original web content, wireless iTV <b>interactivity,</b> graphic novels available for mobile viewing and webisodes.|$|E
25|$|The {{series has}} {{generally}} received positive reviews, {{with the original}} Red Faction and third installment Red Faction: Guerrilla getting the most acclaim, while Red Faction II and series low pointat least criticallyRed Faction: Armageddon having weaker scores. Some common flaws are that graphics are considered behind its time or unremarkable. Also, the scattered story and limited <b>interactivity</b> in the levels have also been criticized overall. On the positive side, the series has been deeply commended for its unique geometry modification capabilities, intelligent AI, and prevalent storytelling themes.|$|E
25|$|The Unix {{system had}} {{significant}} impact on other operating systems. It achieved its reputation by its <b>interactivity,</b> by providing the software at a nominal fee for educational use, by running on inexpensive hardware, and by being easy to adapt and move to different machines. Unix was originally written in assembly language (which had been thought necessary for system implementations on early computers), but was soon rewritten in C, a high-level programming language. Although this followed the lead of Multics and Burroughs, it was Unix that popularized the idea.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{feature of}} the library is its {{abstraction}} layer of the browser rendering model. The library uses Ajax for communicating with Ajax-capable browsers, while using plain HTML form post-backs for other user agents (for accessibility and search engines). Using a progressive bootstrap method, the user interface is initially rendered as plain HTML, and for Ajax-capable browsers, it is automatically upgraded to use Ajax for increased <b>interactivity.</b> In this way, {{it is the only}} server-side framework that implements progressive enhancement automatically, and the only Ajax framework with search engine optimization (SEO) qualities.|$|E
25|$|NBC Universal {{announced}} on April 2, 2008, that NBC Digital Entertainment would release {{a series on}} online content for {{the summer and fall}} of 2008, including more original web content and webisodes. Heroes webisodes are expected to air through an extension of the Heroes Evolutions in July. Other media and digital extensions announced include an online manhunts for the villains, the addition of more micro sites that allow the users to uncover more of the Heroes universe, wireless iTV <b>interactivity</b> and the ability to view the graphic novel on mobile platforms.|$|E
25|$|The game's MIDI {{musical score}} {{includes}} pieces from John Williams' Star Wars score {{in addition to}} original compositions. X-Wing is the first non-adventure game to use the iMUSE Interactive MUsic Streaming Engine, although the system's level of <b>interactivity</b> is reduced from previous iterations. For X-Wing, iMUSE provides musical cues in response to in-game events, such as the arrival of friendly or hostile ships. Music designers Michael Land, Clint Bajakian, and Peter McConnell used familiar elements of Williams' music to create these cues. The musical cues were designed to blend seamlessly {{with the rest of}} the in-game music soundtrack.|$|E
25|$|While most {{adventure}} games {{typically do}} not include any time-based <b>interactivity</b> by the player, action-adventure games are a hybrid of action games with adventure games that often require to the player to react quickly to events as they occur on screen. The action-adventure genre is broad, spanning many different subgenres, but typically these games utilize strong storytelling and puzzle-solving mechanics of adventure games among the action-oriented gameplay concepts. The foremost title in this genre was Adventure, a graphic home console game developed based on the text-based Colossal Cave Adventure, while the first The Legend of Zelda brought the action-adventure concept to a broader audience.|$|E
