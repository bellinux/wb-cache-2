5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two {{welfare reform}} bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed <b>for</b> <b>passage</b> of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.|$|E

5|$|While {{the bill}} had been {{proposed}} by Republican Senators Rick Santorum and Mel Martinez, {{it also had}} the support of Democratic Senator Tom Harkin due to disability rights concerns in the Schiavo case. Harkin had worked with disability rights groups for years and co-authored the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. American disability rights groups traditionally tend to ally themselves with Democrats and the political left; however, in the Schiavo case they joined pro-life organizations in opposing the removal of her feeding tube and supporting the Palm Sunday Compromise. According to Marilyn Golden, Harkin's support was necessary <b>for</b> <b>passage</b> of the bill, as any voice opposition by Democrats would have delayed it.|$|E
50|$|An {{advantage}} of making bridges moveable is the lower cost, {{due to the}} absence of high piers and long approaches. The principal disadvantage is that the traffic on the bridge must be halted when it is opened <b>for</b> <b>passages.</b> <b>For</b> seldom-used railroad bridges over busy channels, the bridge may be left open and then closed <b>for</b> train <b>passages.</b> <b>For</b> small bridges, bridge movement may be enabled without the need for an engine. Some bridges are operated by the users, especially those with a boat, others by a bridgeman (or bridge tender); a few remotely using video-cameras and loudspeakers. Generally, the bridges are powered by electric motors, whether operating winches, gearing, or hydraulic pistons. While moveable bridges in their entirety may be quite long, the length of the moveable portion is restricted by engineering and cost considerations to a few hundred feet.|$|R

Before this book was published, the CIA demanded that Marchetti remove 399 passages, but Marchetti resisted and only 168 passages were censored. It is the first book the federal government of the United States ever went to court to censor before its publication. The publisher (Alfred A.

The outer border of West Berlin, which was also the border between West-Berlin and the GDR, had also been closed down in 1952. During the night of 12 to 13 August 1961 the National People's Army, the German Border Police, the Volkspolizei and the Combat Groups of the Working Class locked down all passages between the Soviet sector and the three West sectors; construction of border protection facilities began.|$|E
5|$|As Secretary Upshur {{accelerated}} the secret treaty discussions, Mexican diplomats learned that US-Texas talks were taking place. Mexican {{minister to the}} U.S. Juan Almonte confronted Upshur with these reports, warning him that if Congress sanctioned a treaty of annexation, Mexico would break diplomatic ties and immediately declare war. Secretary Upshur evaded and dismissed the charges, and pressed forward with the negotiations. In tandem with moving forward with Texas diplomats, Upshur was secretly lobbying US Senators to support annexation, providing lawmakers with persuasive arguments linking Texas acquisition to national security and domestic peace. By early 1844, Upshur was able to assure Texas officials that 40 of the 52 members of the Senate were pledged to ratify the Tyler-Texas treaty, more than the two-thirds majority required <b>for</b> <b>passage.</b> Tyler, in his annual address to Congress in December 1843, maintained his silence on the secret treaty, {{so as not to}} damage relations with the wary Texas diplomats. Throughout, Tyler did his utmost to keep the negotiations secret, making no public reference to his administration's single-minded quest for Texas.|$|E
5|$|As {{a treaty}} {{document}} {{with a foreign}} nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required {{the support of a}} two-thirds majority in the Senate <b>for</b> <b>passage.</b> But in fact, when the Senate voted on the measure on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats. Tyler had anticipated that the measure would fail, due largely to the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.|$|E

5|$|Fury {{was built}} by J. Samuel White at its Cowes {{shipyard}} under the 1932 Naval Programme. The ship was laid down on 19 May 1933, launched on 10 September 1934, as the eleventh ship to carry the name, and completed on 18 April 1935. The ship cost 248,538 pounds, excluding Admiralty supplied equipment such as armaments and communications sets. Fury was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but was sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of her sister ships, during the Abyssinian crisis in June. On 11 December 1936, {{the day after his}} abdication broadcast to the nation, Fury embarked HRH The Duke of Windsor <b>for</b> <b>passage</b> to Boulogne-sur-Mer. After returning home, she remained there aside from deployments to Spanish waters to enforce the arms embargo imposed on both sides in the Spanish Civil War by the Non-Intervention Committee. The flotilla was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939, five months before the start of World War II. Fury remained assigned to it until June 1940, escorting the larger ships of the fleet and conducting anti-submarine patrols.|$|E
