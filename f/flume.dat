5|$|Storm Coaster is a Water Coaster {{located at}} the Sea World theme park on the Gold Coast, Australia. The ride is {{designed}} by German firm Mack Rides and combines the <b>flume</b> and splashdown elements of a log <b>flume,</b> with the chain lift hill and drops of a steel roller coaster.|$|E
5|$|After {{the train}} departs Main Street, U.S.A. Station, it crosses an access {{road in the}} Adventureland section, travels over a small bridge, enters a small tunnel, then crosses a second access road in the Frontierland section. After going through a tunnel through the Splash Mountain log <b>flume</b> attraction, the train stops at Frontierland Station.|$|E
5|$|Mining has {{historically}} {{been done in the}} watershed of Nanticoke Creek. This has substantially altered the hydrology and topography of the watershed. The period during which the watershed was mined lasted more than 100 years. A <b>flume</b> made of concrete has been constructed in the watershed of the creek.|$|E
50|$|Silver Bullet: Wild Waters only speed <b>flumes,</b> {{they were}} part of the Silver River <b>Flumes</b> area. Dual speed <b>flumes</b> ran side by side and ended in a large splash pool. Unlike newer speed <b>flumes,</b> the Silver Bullet did not go {{straight}} down from the top. The <b>flumes</b> had two dips, with plateaus in between them.|$|R
50|$|By the 1960's several {{different}} companies began to commercially offer Parshall <b>flumes.</b> These manufacturers have typically produce <b>flumes</b> from {{one type of}} material only (typically fiberglass/grp or steel), although currently a few, such as Openchannelflow, offer Parshall <b>flumes</b> {{in a variety of}} materials.|$|R

5|$|The city of Yonkers {{carried out}} a $48 million {{daylighting}} project in the 2010s to remove the <b>flume</b> that the river flows through under Yonkers and bring the river to the surface. The project uncovered the river for six blocks in Downtown Yonkers. The newly surfaced river {{is the centerpiece of}} an urban park in Getty Square, Downtown Yonkers.|$|E
5|$|A 2004-05 EPA {{study of}} the river rated the water quality 6 out of 100. The study also {{discovered}} that dissolved oxygen levels in the water were low because there were few organisms, poor sediment, and little plant life in the river. Although storm water from residential neighborhoods added dissolved oxygen, it also brought ammonia from fertilizer. The Army Corps of Engineers found that the channeling prevented aquatic life from sustaining itself; few fish naturally spawn in the river because of the cement casing and <b>flume</b> at its mouth.|$|E
5|$|After {{the journey}} restarts, the train enters a tunnel through the Splash Mountain log <b>flume</b> attraction, crosses a trestle {{bridge over the}} Critter Country section, wraps around the Rivers of America in the Frontierland section, and rolls through another tunnel before {{reaching}} Mickey's Toontown Depot between the Mickey's Toontown and Fantasyland sections. While the train is stopped at this station, a non-functioning water tower {{can be seen on}} the opposite side of the track to the station's depot building.|$|E
40|$|The {{calibration}} {{of small}} Parshall <b>flumes</b> for measuring flows ranging in magnitude from 0. 1 to 1. 1 {{cubic feet per}} second (cfs) was accomplished by A. R. Robinson (1960) at Colorado State University. The purpose of Robinson’s investigation was to accurately calibrate and standardize the design of small Parshall measuring <b>flumes.</b> The rated <b>flumes</b> were constructed of galvanized sheet metal. Data was collected for Parshall <b>flumes</b> having throat widths of 1 -, 2 -, and 3 - inches. Calibration tables or curves were prepared for both free and submerged flow. The dimensions of the Parshall <b>flumes</b> rated by Robinson are shown in Figure 1. The study reported herein was made to illustrate that the analysis of submergence developed at Utah State University (Hyatt, 1965) for trapezoidal <b>flumes</b> is applicable to small Parshall <b>flumes.</b> The data reported by Robinson (1960) is analyzed by the submergence parameters reported by Hyatt (1965) and the resulting equations and calibration curves are listed in this report...|$|R
50|$|Venturi <b>flumes</b> {{have two}} {{advantages}} over weirs where the critical depth {{is created by}} a vertical constriction. First, the hydraulic head loss is smaller in <b>flumes</b> than in weirs. Second, there is no dead zone in <b>flumes</b> where sediment and debris can accumulate; such a dead zone exists upstream of the weirs.|$|R
50|$|Smaller Montana <b>flumes</b> {{tend to be}} {{fabricated}} from fiberglass and {{galvanized steel}} (depending upon the application), while larger Montana <b>flumes</b> can be fabricated from fiberglass (sizes up to 160") or concrete (160"-600").|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} the year, {{plans were}} being made for {{construction}} of the freeway between <b>Flume</b> Drive east of El Cajon and Laguna Junction, and the portion of the freeway from Fairmount Avenue to Lake Murray Boulevard was contracted for $2.6 million. In January 1960, the Taylor Street to Cabrillo Freeway portions were under construction, including the interchange at the latter, and were scheduled to be complete by October, while the Cabrillo Freeway to Fairmout Avenue portion was up for bid; the next month, the contract was awarded for $4.6 million, with interchanges to be constructed at Texas Street and Ward Road to replace traffic signals. In July, the new I-8 designation for the road was announced, and plans to post signs were made. Another contract for the portion from Grossmont Summit near Chase Avenue to Ballantyne Avenue was awarded for $2.7 million in November.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{research}} at Dalhousie {{has become a}} large focus of the university, {{with many of the}} university's faculty members involved in some form of marine research. Notably, Dalhousie is the headquarters of the Ocean Tracking Network, a research effort using implanted acoustic transmitters to study fish migration patterns. Dalhousie houses a number of marine research pools, a wet laboratory, and a benthic <b>flume,</b> which are collectively known as the Aquatron laboratory. Dalhousie is one of the founding members of the Halifax Marine Research Institute, founded on 2 June 2011. The institute, which is a partnership between a number of private industries, government, and post-secondary institutions, was designed to help increase the scale, quality, internationalization and impact of marine research in the region. In 2011, the university, along with WWF-Canada, created the Conservation Legacy For Oceans, which aimed at providing scholarships, funding, curriculum development, and work placements for students and academics dedicated to marine research, law, management, and policy making.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Flume</b> (1979–2008)– Known as Ye Olde Log <b>Flume</b> {{until the}} early 1990s, the <b>Flume</b> was a log <b>flume</b> ride. The <b>Flume</b> was {{permanently}} closed and dismantled {{at the end of}} the 2008 season. Soak City waterpark (previously Whitewater Country waterpark) was extended in place of the <b>Flume</b> to accommodate the installation of Breakers Bay, a wave pool attraction.|$|E
50|$|Osceola's Revenge and Bunyan's Bend: Dual <b>flumes</b> {{that were}} part of the Silver River <b>Flumes</b> area. Both <b>flumes</b> begin at the same point, but did not run {{parallel}} and had different patterns. Both featured many drops and turns, and both end at the same splash pool. Osceola's Revenge had an extra drop, and was therefore rated with a higher thrill level than Bunyon's Bend.|$|R
5000|$|As with weirs, <b>flumes</b> {{can also}} {{have an effect on}} local fauna. Some species or certain life stages of the same species may be blocked by <b>flumes</b> due to {{relatively}} slow swim speeds or behavioral characteristics.|$|R

25|$|Most locks have a bypass <b>flume,</b> {{which allows}} water {{to bypass the}} lock to water the level below. If the <b>flume</b> was covered over with concrete, that {{generally}} meant that a roadway passed over the lock. Originally the locks 1-27, {{with the possible exception}} of Lock 13 did not have bypass flumes, using the culverts to divert water, but later the bypass flumes were put in (which is what we see today).|$|E

First, there is {{a search for a}} convenient profile in confusor for research and consequently to construct graphical dependences from which to read the value of the correction coefficient for many water depths in <b>flumes.</b> Then, there are constructed graphical dependences from which to read the value of measurement uncertainty for many flow rates in <b>flumes...</b>|$|R
50|$|The race now {{comprises}} {{on average}} a 1m deep ditch about 1.8m in width with a 2m wide bank on the downhill side {{made up of}} the excavated material - earth and small rocks. However, in some places the ditch is up to 2 metres deep. Sections where the race crosses gullies have been bridged with timber <b>fluming.</b> In the surveyed sections a number of the timber upright supports for the <b>fluming</b> remain standing, but no <b>fluming</b> has survived.|$|R

25|$|A {{campground}} {{was completed}} {{in time for the}} 1978 season and the park's well-known Lost World mountain debuted in 1979. Originally, the Lost World featured three rides: a <b>flume</b> ride called Voyage to Atlantis, a children's attraction mine ride known as Land of the Dooz, and a rotor called Time Shaft. Only a year later in 1980, the <b>flume</b> ride was rethemed Haunted River. Kings Dominion later expanded Old Virginia with the addition of the park's third wooden roller coaster, the Grizzly, in 1982 and a river rapids ride called White Water Canyon in 1983.|$|E
25|$|Most of Carlsbad's {{development}} {{was due to}} irrigation water. Local cattleman recognized the value of diverting water from the Pecos River to the grazing lands on Eddy's Halagueno Ranch. Many construction projects were undertaken to establish an irrigation system within the town. The Avalon Dam was constructed upstream of town, and canals diverted the water into town. Conflict arose when the canals met the river downstream; as a result, the Pecos River <b>Flume</b> was built, first out of wood and later concrete (the <b>flume</b> is often titled {{the only place where}} a river crosses itself).|$|E
