5|$|Brown lists {{among his}} {{achievements}} as a legislator his authorship of a 2007 law {{that created a}} check-off box on state income tax forms for veterans to <b>indicate</b> <b>whether</b> they served in Iraq or Afghanistan. The state uses the information to notify veterans of available services and benefits, including the Welcome Home Bonus that provides $1,000 for those returning from active duty in Afghanistan or Iraq.|$|E

5|$|CT scans, chest X-rays {{and other}} forms of imaging can help {{evaluate}} the heart's size, evaluate for signs of pulmonary oedema, and <b>indicate</b> <b>whether</b> there is fluid around the heart. They are also useful for evaluating the aorta, the major blood vessel which leaves the heart.|$|E
5|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} tests (NAATs), direct fluorescein tests (DFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) {{are highly}} sensitive tests that can identify specific pathogens present. Serology testing for antibodies {{is not as}} useful since {{the presence of the}} microorganisms in healthy people can confound interpreting the antibody titer levels, although antibody levels can <b>indicate</b> <b>whether</b> an infection is recent or long-term.|$|E
5|$|Paleoclimatology is {{the study}} of past climate over a great period of the Earth's history. It uses {{evidence}} from ice sheets, tree rings, sediments, coral, and rocks to determine the past state of the climate. It demonstrates periods of stability and periods of change and can <b>indicate</b> <b>whether</b> changes follow patterns such as regular cycles.|$|E

5|$|Breathing quality gases do not {{normally}} deteriorate during storage in steel or aluminium cylinders. Provided there is insufficient water content to promote internal corrosion, the stored gas will remain unchanged for years if stored at temperatures within the allowed working range for the cylinder, usually below 65°C. If {{there is any}} doubt, a check of oxygen fraction will <b>indicate</b> <b>whether</b> the gas has changed (the other components are inert). Any unusual smells would be {{an indication that the}} cylinder or gas was contaminated at the time of filling. However some authorities recommend releasing most of the contents and storing cylinders with a small positive pressure.|$|E
5|$|Ski orienteering {{is a form}} of {{cross-country}} skiing competition that requires navigation in a landscape, making optimal route choices at racing speeds. Standard orienteering maps are used, but with special green overprinting of trails and tracks to indicate their navigability in snow; other symbols <b>indicate</b> <b>whether</b> any roads are snow-covered or clear. Standard skate-skiing equipment is used, along with a map holder attached to the chest. It is one of the four orienteering disciplines recognized by the International Orienteering Federation. Upper body strength is especially important because of frequent double poling along narrow snow trails.|$|E
5|$|H.B. 444 was {{introduced}} in the Hawaii House of Representatives on January 26, 2009. It passed the Hawaii House Judiciary Committee on February 5, 2009, with 12members voting in favor and none opposed and was approved by the Hawaii House of Representatives on February 12, 2009, with 33 members voting in favor and 17 opposed, one vote fewer than the two-thirds vote needed to override a veto by the Republican Governor Linda Lingle, who did not <b>indicate</b> <b>whether</b> she considered a veto. It was referred to the Hawaii Senate on February 13, 2009. A hearing by the Committee on Judiciary and Government Operations (JGO) was held at the State Capitol on February 24, 2009, with the outcome of three senators supporting the bill and three opposed; the bill was not passed out of committee.|$|E

5|$|In late May 2007, 20th Century Fox {{struck a}} deal with the Franklin Mint to promote the movie by {{altering}} 40,000 U.S. quarters and releasing them into circulation. All of the altered quarters were minted in 2005 and honor the state of California as part of the 50 State Quarters program created by the U.S. Mint. The altered quarters feature the Silver Surfer on the reverse along with a URL to the movie's official website. Once the U.S. Mint became aware of the promotion, it notified the studio and the Franklin Mint that it was breaking the law by turning government-issued currency into private advertising. The federal mint did not <b>indicate</b> <b>whether</b> a penalty would be effected.|$|E
5|$|Surcharges {{imposed by}} the Irish post office on mail bearing {{insufficient}} pre-paid postage had the postage due collected {{by the use of}} these labels. Since 1925 there have been six series printed, with the design remaining the same until 1980, though the colour and watermarks have changed. The Irish word pingin, for penny, is used in both £.s.d and decimal currency, but because it has the same meaning in each, the value on the label does not <b>indicate</b> <b>whether</b> the label was issued before or after decimalisation. Hence, identifying the issue of a label requires further information: if collectors knows the date of use, the existence of a watermark and if so which type, and the specific colour, identification will be easier. For example, the 3d value was blue between 1940 and 1969, and stone colour from 1971 until 1980; it changed from a watermarked to a non-watermark paper in 1978. Additionally, the 1, 5 and 8 pence values are seen in two different colours depending on the issue, while the d, 1d, 2d and 6d are seen with both watermark varieties. Except for the sixth issue, which has the word Éire in the design, there is no explicit country identity on any of the others. The first four series use only Irish words.|$|E
5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to <b>indicate</b> <b>whether</b> the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E
