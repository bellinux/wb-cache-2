2500|$|Subsequently, Gomaco Trolley Company has won {{contracts}} {{from other}} operators to build or rebuild vintage streetcars and, unlike with the Lowell line, Gomaco's later products have mostly {{been used by}} public transit agencies, for regular service along city streets. [...] In 1991–92, the company provided four streetcars to TriMet, in Portland, Oregon, for use on the Portland Vintage Trolley service, which began operation in late 1991. Similar to the [...] "Lowell enclosed" [...] model, these were replicas of 1904 Brill-built, <b>double-truck</b> cars, patterned on streetcars that had been operated locally, in Portland. [...] However, in this instance the replicas would be sharing the tracks with modern light rail cars of TriMet's MAX system, so while Gomaco based the new bodies on the 1904 cars, the trucks were a younger style (1940s/'50s) which the company assembled from parts it acquired from Boston streetcars and Chicago rapid-transit cars. [...] The four Portland cars (511–514) also were equipped with modern features such as Automatic Train Stop.|$|E
5000|$|The company built many of {{the wooden}} {{electric}} overhead-trolley powered streetcars used throughout the United States primarily {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. Known for their workmanship and durability, some of the cars built by Perley A. Thomas Car Works in the early 1920s are still operating today in New Orleans. Thomas based the design of these cars on New Orleans' first order for double-ended, <b>double-trucked,</b> arch-roofed electric streetcars, the 400-series from Southern Car Works.|$|R
5000|$|The dream {{takes place}} in a strange land, and Phillips explores the land for a while before encountering railway tracks. On the tracks he finds [...] "a yellow, vestibuled car {{numbered}} 1852--of a plain, <b>double-trucked</b> type common from 1900 to 1910." [...] This car is ready to start and he climbs aboard, investigating it and searching for a lightswitch so that he can see better. He hears a noise behind him, and after turning to look, sees two men coming towards him (he assumes them to be the motorman and the conductor). The first man lifts his head to the sky, sniffs, and howls, while the second drops to all fours and runs toward the car and Phillips. Phillips immediately runs out of the car, continuing to flee until he is too tired to run any farther.|$|R
5000|$|A longer, <b>double-truck</b> {{version of}} the Birney car was {{developed}} in the 1920s, incorporating its most successful features. These were sold to a number of systems, including that of Tampa, Florida, and to the Texas Interurban Railway, which used them exclusively. [...] In addition to 11 <b>double-truck</b> passenger cars, which featured deluxe interior appointments and toilets for interurban service, the Texas Interurban operated 3 unusual Birney-based <b>double-truck</b> express cars without passenger seats or windows- the only cars of this type ever built.|$|E

50|$|There were 10 trams, 4 single-truck Boon cars (No.s 1-4), 3 <b>Double-truck</b> Boon cars (Nos 5-6 and 10) and 3 Birney Safety Cars {{introduced}} in 1921 (Nos. 7-9). These all lasted until {{closure of the}} system, at which time the bodies were auctioned off and sold. Only one tram body survives (Birney No 8) and is currently in Wanganui.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{rolling stock}} {{consisted}} of fifteen single-truck and ten bogie cars manufactured by J. G. Brill Company of Philadelphia. The single truck cars were equipped with two 35hp General Electric motors, and the <b>double-truck</b> cars with four motors {{of the same}} capacity. Five of the bogie cars were transferred to Perth in 1903, with five replacements delivered to Kalgoorlie in 1904. Seven trailer cars were purchased at the same time. In the 1930s an additional eight trams were bodied locally by the Kalgoorlie Electric Tramway.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, the Gomaco Trolley Company {{has built}} at least 18 replica Birney cars, {{in the style}} of the less-common <b>double-truck</b> Birney car design, since 1999. Gomaco fitted these with trucks from ex-Milan, Italy Peter Witt streetcars. These have been {{supplied}} to Tampa, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina; Little Rock, Arkansas and Memphis, Tennessee. [...] Gomaco also restored an original single-truck Birney car body in 2002-3 for the Fresno Metropolitan Flood Control District in Fresno, California; this was intended for static display in a local park.|$|E
5000|$|The Materfer trams {{began to}} arrive in mid-1988, with six {{delivered}} {{by the end of}} the year. Their electrical equipment was supplied by Siemens. Like the temporary cars rebuilt from metro cars, the Materfer/Siemens trams are <b>double-truck,</b> double-ended cars. [...] They have seating for 24 passengers and room for around 115 standees. They have three doors on each side. The low-platform stops along the line are long enough to accommodate only one car at a time, and multiple-unit operation is not planned, so the tramcars are not equipped with couplers.|$|E

50|$|In addition, an open {{streetcar}} {{built by}} the J. G. Brill Company in 1907 was acquired from the Texas Transportation Museum (in San Antonio, Texas) in 1995. It is ex-Veracruz, Mexico, No. 6.The Fort Smith and Veracruz cars are all single-truck cars, but in 1992 FSSRA acquired the body of Hot Springs Street Railway Company car 50 (St. Louis Car Company, 1904), a <b>double-truck</b> car which once operated in Hot Springs. The organization subsequently acquired trucks and motors for the car, and began working on restoring it to operating condition, a goal that was reached in 2016. Another Birney car in the collection is ex-Kansas City 1545, built in 1919.|$|E
50|$|Delivery of the Materfer cars was {{originally}} due {{to begin in}} mid-1987, but it soon became apparent {{that they would not}} be ready until mid-1988 or later, which would be well after construction of the line was completed. In order to avoid a long delay in the opening of the line, officials decided to create a temporary fleet by converting some 1913 metro cars into trams. They were <b>double-truck</b> (four-axle), non-articulated, double-ended (bidirectional) trams. A total of eight such cars were built, using new metal bodies manufactured in Buenos Aires by EMEPA S.A., mounted on the original 1913 Belgian-built La Brugeoise underframes. They were painted in a livery of all-over green. The first three of these inaugurated service on the first section of line E2 in April 1987.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the cars built were sold to streetcar operators in North America (including in Mexico and Cuba), a small number went to much more distant places, such as Australia and New Zealand. In the latter, Birney cars were imported for use by the provincial centres of New Plymouth in the North Island and Invercargill in the South Island, reputedly the world's most southerly tramway system. Cities in South America whose streetcar companies purchased Birney cars included Concordia and Paraná, in Argentina, while Guayaquil in Ecuador obtained Birneys secondhand from Trenton, New Jersey. The Colombian cities of Medellín and Pereira both were served by Birney streetcars, the former's fleet being made up entirely of Birney cars - 61 of them - of both single- and <b>double-truck</b> configuration. In 1930, Curitiba tramway system bought 20 second-hand Birney cars from Boston and these cars were converted to metre gauge.|$|E
50|$|For the {{interurban}} line, {{the original}} fleet consisted of five steam locomotives, nos. 1-3 built in 1892 and 4-5 built in 1895 and 1898. They hauled passenger trailers {{of two or}} four axles. Locomotives 2, 3 and 5 remained in the fleet until 1903. For the introduction of electric tram service on line 5 in 1902, TN acquired seven double-ended, <b>double-truck</b> (four-axle) tramcars and four matching trailers. All were built in 1902 by SWS, the motored cars being numbered 41-47 and the trailers 51-54; the latter were renumbered 121-124 in 1911. The 1902 cars remained in service for almost 80 years. In 1967-68, {{they were joined by}} four articulated trams acquired secondhand from Genoa, Italy. Built in 1942 by Breda, these had carried numbers 1101-1104 in the Genoa tram system's fleet, and they kept the same numbers in Neuchâtel until 1980. They were the only articulated trams ever included in the fleet, and were used exclusively on line 5.|$|E
5000|$|Subsequently, Gomaco Trolley Company has won {{contracts}} {{from other}} operators to build or rebuild vintage streetcars and, unlike with the Lowell line, Gomaco's later products have mostly {{been used by}} public transit agencies, for regular service along city streets.

5000|$|From 1902 onwards both Salford and Manchester tram systems, uniquely in Britain, {{employed}} uniformed [...] "trolley boys" [...] - over {{a thousand}} at their peak (Jan 1930) - whose job it was to assist guards on <b>double-truck</b> trams by giving the driver a bell signal at the stops and helping passengers on and off. Because by the early 1900s there were multiple organisations owning various sections of tramways in the Manchester and surrounding areas, Manchester {{took the lead in}} rebuilding and electrifying their routes so that they could be leased back for operational services. The largest boroughs (Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham and Salford) continued to operate their own lines and began their own modernisation. At Bury, Oldham and Rochdale, the steam services were also brought {{under the control of the}} local municipalities. In 1904 the Glossop Urban District Supply Company was set up to provide electric trams to Dukinfield, Glossop, Hyde, Mossley, and Stalybridge. The short 2.5 mile run in Trafford Park came under the joint control of the Corporations of Manchester and Salford.|$|E
