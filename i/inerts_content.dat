40|$|Nowadays the {{composting}} process has shown itself to be an alternative {{in the treatment of}} municipal solid wastes by composting plants. However, although more than 50 % of the waste generated by the Brazilian population is composed of matter susceptible to organic composting, this process is, still today, insufficiently developed in Brazil, due to low compost quality and lack of investments in the sector. The objective of this work was to use physical analyses to evaluate the quality of the compost produced at 14 operative composting plants in the Sao Paulo State in Brazil. For this purpose, size distribution and total <b>inert</b> <b>content</b> tests were done. The results were analyzed by grouping the plants according to their productive processes: plants with a rotating drum, plants with shredders or mills, and plants without treatment after the sorting conveyor belt. Compost quality was analyzed considering the limits imposed by the Brazilian Legislation and the European standards for <b>inert</b> <b>contents.</b> The size distribution tests showed the influence of the machinery after the sorting conveyer on the granule sizes as well as the <b>inert</b> <b>content,</b> which contributes to the presence of materials that reduce the quality of the final produc...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of electric field-activated self-propagating reactions is investigated using the combustion front quenching technique. In particular, previously published experimental results obtained through the Field Assisted Combustion Synthesis (FACS) of b-SiC, TaC, Ti 3 Al and B 4 C-TiB 2 are re-examined and compared. Pre-combustion and combustion stages involved during synthesis wave propagation are postulated for all systems. Subsequently, modeling results aimed at simulating the process where an electric field-activated self-propagating reaction takes place are presented. In particular, a one-dimensional model of FACS technique is developed {{to simulate the}} rapid quenching of the reaction during its progress as the applied field is turned off.

40|$|Waste {{combustion}} on a grate {{with energy}} recovery {{is an important}} pillar of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in the Netherlands. In MSW incinerators fresh waste stacked on a grate enters the combustion chamber, heats up by radiation from the flame above the layer and ignition occurs. Typically, the reaction zone starts {{at the top of}} the waste layer and propagates downwards, producing heat for drying and devolatilization of the fresh waste below it until the ignition front reaches the grate. The control of this process is mainly based on empiricism. MSW is a highly inhomogeneous fuel with continuous fluctuating moisture content, heating value and chemical composition. The resulting process fluctuations may cause process control difficulties, fouling and corrosion issues, extra maintenance, and unplanned stops. In the new concept the fuel layer is ignited by means of preheated air (T > 220 °C) from below without any external ignition source. As a result a combustion front will be formed close to the grate and will propagate upwards. That is why this approach is denoted by upward combustion. Experimental research has been carried out in a batch reactor with height of 4. 55 m, an inner diameter of 200 mm and a fuel layer height up to 1 m. Due to a high quality two-layer insulation adiabatic conditions can be assumed. The primary air can be preheated up to 350 °C, and the secondary air is distributed via nozzles above the waste layer. During the experiments, temperatures along the height of the reactor, gas composition and total weight decrease are continuously monitored. The influence of the primary air speed, fuel moisture and <b>inert</b> <b>content</b> on the combustion characteristics (ignition rate, combustion rate, ignition front speed and temperature of the reaction zone) is evaluated. The upward combustion concept decouples the drying, devolatilization and burnout phase. In this way the moisture and <b>inert</b> <b>content</b> of the waste have almost no influence on the combustion process. In this paper an experimental comparison between conventional and reversed combustion is presente...|$|R

Bibliography: leaves 103 - 107. vii, 107 l illusAn {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the <b>inert</b> gas <b>content</b> of Some mineral inclusions from volcanic rocks. Potassium-argon dating of these inclusions has shown that they contain radiogenic argon in excess of that predicted by geochronological methods. Inclusions from Hualalai (Hawaii), Salt Lake Crater (Oahu), dredged from the Puna Rift east of Kilauea (Hawaii), and from Bultfontein, Republic of South Africa were examined. Specimens investigated were dunite nodules and separated grains of olivine, mica, pyroxene, and feldspar. Existing gas extraction and mass spectrographic equipment was modified to allow helium analysis, and also to make the entire gas analysis more rapid and convenient. A technique was developed for the analysis of potassium in olivine by flame photometry. The results from this study indicate that a similarity exists in helium-to-argon ratios found in inclusions from different sources and that the absolute <b>inert</b> gas <b>content</b> varies significantly within individual samples. The excess argon found in the deep ocean tholeiite cautions against the use of similar samples for potassium-argon dating.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the conclusions of recent meta-analyses of the placebo effect in major depression, to explain the mechanism by which placebo exerts its effect, and to discuss whether placebo can be used in the treatment of patients with major depression in clinical practice. Recent meta-analyses have demonstrated that the placebo effect is estimated to account for 67 % of the treatment effect in patients receiving antidepressants, and furthermore that placebo is as effective as antidepressants in patients with mild to moderate major depression (reporting a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score lower than 25), whereas placebo is less effective than antidepressants in severely depressed patients. However, several limitations make the translation of these conclusions into clinical practice impracticable. Clinicians should learn from the "placebo lesson" to maximize the nonspecific effects of treatment when they prescribe an antidepressant, particularly in less severely depressed patients, who show a higher placebo response in randomized controlled trials. This strategy can increase the antidepressant effect and may reduce nonadherence with treatment. © 2013 Marchesi et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSmoldering {{combustion}} is the slow, low-temperature, flameless {{burning of}} porous fuels {{and the most}} persistent type of combustion. It is the driving phenomenon of wildfires in peatlands, like those causing haze episodes in Southeast Asia and Northeast Europe, but is poorly understood. In this work, we develop a comprehensive 1 -D model of a reactive porous media, using the open-source code Gpyro, to investigate smoldering combustion of natural fuels {{with an emphasis on}} the roles of the moisture and <b>inert</b> <b>contents.</b> The model solves the species, momentum, and energy conservation equations and includes heterogeneous chemical reactions. A previously developed 5 -step reaction scheme for peat, including evaporation of water, is adopted to describe the drying, thermal and oxidative degradation during the smoldering combustion. The model predicts the transient temperature, species, and reaction profiles during ignition, spread, and extinction. The predicted smoldering thresholds related to the critical moisture and inorganic contents for ignition show a good agreement with the experimental results in the literature {{for a wide range of}} peat types and organic soils. The influences of the kinetic parameters, physical properties, and ignition protocol are investigated. This is the first time that a physics-based model of smoldering peat fires is developed, thus helping to understand this important natural and widespread phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|South Africa {{remains the}} 5 th largest {{producer}} and 4 th {{largest exporter of}} coal in the world. It is also the largest supplier of coal to the European Union. This fact is significant as the European Union has recently supported the environmental lobby that threatens the combined full scale use of coal in Europe and other first world countries. This promotes the development of clean coal technologies in order to counter the ever increasing number of environmental constraints threatening the export market. One critical development in clean coal technologies is coal beneficiation, which allows the reduction of ash and <b>inert</b> <b>content.</b> Permian coals from South Africa have characteristically high ash and inertinite contents and therefore require further beneficiation. The Witbank coalfield No. 4 seam is no exception. It {{can be described as}} being more inert and having a higher mineral content compared to the No. 2 seam in the same coalfield also mined for export purposes. With the increase in environmental legislation and the push towards “clean coal” this raises a concern in terms of the performance and marketability of export coal produced from the No. 4 seam. This seam will in the future be economically significant and is still a great source for export steam coal. Due to the nature and composition of the No. 4 seam, coal beneficiation is essential to reduce the mineral and <b>inert</b> <b>content</b> to be in line with export quality specification levels. Washability characteristics of the No. 4 seam coal indicate that the No. 4 seam is difficult to beneficiate. Until recently the main clean-ability parameters evaluated in South African export coals as per customer specification included mainly heating value, moisture and ash reduction with little to no work being done on trace element concentration reduction. This paper focuses on the partitioning of the trace elements within the seam in relation to the organic and inorganic affinity of the trace elements and possible methods of trace element reduction by removal using coal beneficiation techniques. The techniques investigated include reduction by washing using dense medium beneficiation and flotation. In each evaluation the focus was on trace-element-tomineral and trace-element-to-organic matter relationship and hence setting the basis for liberation analysis to evaluate reducibility. By the evaluation of the coal mineralogy, petrography and trace element relationships, methods of optimum trace element reduction can be established. With the focus on marketing it was shown that carbon loss need not be sacrificed in the reduction of specific trace elements in the No. 4 seam and that the trace element distribution itself allows for beneficiation whilst maintaining acceptable yields. Processes and possible beneficiation techniques for optimum trace element reduction and marketability {{in the case of the}} No. 4 seam are proposed...|$|R

With the elimination of hot spots, which are known as the most negative factors for partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, steady and uniform reaction conditions can be achieved in the catalyst bed by using, the microreactor. Since the best performance of the catalysts might be exploited, the selectivity of partial oxidation products of toluene has remarkably increased compared to the traditional packed fixed-bed reactor, even without the bother of modifying the catalysts, diluting the reactants or catalysts with <b>inert</b> <b>contents</b> to avoid hot spots or improve the diffusion and mixing. Furthermore, in virtue of its inherent safety features, when using pure oxygen as oxidant, the reactions were handled safety within the explosion limits in the microreactor. With TiO 2 carried V 2 O 5 as catalysts, the total selectivity of benzaldehyde and benzoic acid reaches around 60 %, and the toluene conversion is about 10 %. The conversion can go up without violent decline of selectivity, unlike most fixed bed reactors.

These parameters are then used to upscale the results to geological deposits and mining piles of different thicknesses. We show that for fine particles, with diameter below 2 mm, spontaneous ignition is possible for deposits of thickness between 10. 7 m and 607 m at ambient temperatures between − 20 ᵒC and 44 ᵒC. For the same ambient temperature range, the critical thickness is in excess of 30 km for deposits made of coarse particles with diameter below 17 mm.

Three inert solids (alumina, Kieselguhr, aerosil) and eleven organic powders have been considered and the following parameters have been determined: (1) the minimum ignition energy, (2) the minimum ignition temperature in cloud and (3) the minimum ignition temperature in 5 mm layer. The effects of the addition of inert solids are described and a simple model is proposed to represent the experimental results. Generally, increasing <b>inert</b> solid <b>content</b> in a powder leads to a higher minimum ignition energy as well as a higher minimum ignition temperatures in cloud and in layer. In some cases, the flammability is influenced above a threshold concentration value, which can be quite high (up to 85 wt. %). Indeed, the proposed model shows a zone below the minimum ignition concentration (MIC), which does not enable an efficient or safe inerting: either the admixed inert solid does not provide a sufficient effect, or it can even facilitate the ignition of the dust by notably improving its dispersability.

In addition to the organic matter balance, we determined several soil organic matter characteristics in soil samples (organic C, N and S <b>contents,</b> <b>inert</b> and decomposable C content, hot water soluble C content, hydrophobicity index calculated from the DRIFT spectrometry, available P, K, Ca and Mg contents and pH). The relationships between the organic matter supply with supplemental sources organic fertilisers and all the selected soil organic matter characteristics were statistically significant.

40|$|In Part 1 an {{iterative}} procedure is described for {{the solution of}} nozzle flow problems with one-step, reversible chemical reactions. The efficiency of the method of calculation is illustrated {{by comparing the results}} with data obtained through the use of machine computations for the recombination of hydrogen atoms in a deLaval nozzle. Two topics concerned with droplet burning are considered in Part 2. Droplets of several important propellants, viz., RP- 1, UDMH and N 2 H 4, were burnt in air and in oxygen. The (effective) evaporation constants were determined experimentally for these fuels. The second topic involves the determination of the propagation rates and mechanism of propagation of a flame in a one-dimensional array of n-octane droplets. The flame propagation rates were found to be a function of the initial droplet size, of the droplet spacing, and directly of the depth of immersion of the droplet in the hot-gas zone. Part 3 consists of a study of the effect of an inert diluent on spectral intensity ratios in propane-oxygen-nitrogen flames. Experiments were conducted with <b>inert</b> diluent <b>contents</b> of 50, 60, 70, and 80 percent nitrogen (by mass) and with equivalence ratios of 0. 6, 0. 8, 1. 0, 1. 2, 1. 4 and 1. 6. The spectral intensity ratio was found to be a function not only of the equivalence ratio but also of the percentage of inert diluent. Hence it is not possible, in general, to use spectral intensity ratios as measures of mixture composition, a procedure that has been used erroneously by a number of investigators...|$|R
40|$|If some alveoli of {{the human}} lungs are not ade-quately ventilated, the 02 tension of the blood leaving these {{elements}} will be low (1, 2), and these spaces {{will contribute to the}} creation of an alveolar-arterial 02 difference (3). As a conse-quence, a certain degree of arterial blood un-saturation must be found in every disease where the ventilation of some part of the lungs is low (regardless of the adequacy of the total ventila-tion) unless a comparable local reduction in blood flow takes place, a decrease that could be trig-gered by the hypoxia of the pulmonary venous blood. The teleological appeal of such a de-crease of blood flow has prompted several studies on the effects of low alveolar 02 tension on blood flow. The essence of the pertinent work on this question has recently been analyzed in an ex-cellent review (4) in which Fishman concludes that "the bulk of the evidence favors the view that during unilateral hypoxia the resistance to perfusion increases in the hypoxic side. " Beale, Fowler, and Comroe (5) have demon-strated that an underventilated (slow) compart-ment (in terms of the ratio of ventilation to volume) of significant magnitude is present in the lungs of the asthmatic patient, even in the symptom-free period.

40|$|Remote {{communities}} in Canada heavily rely on reciprocating diesel generators for heat and power generation. These engines utilize diesel fuel that is imported at great expense and generate green-house gas (GHG) and pollutant emissions. Replacing diesel fuel in these engines by syngas {{derived from a}} thermo-chemical treatment of local renewable biomass can not only lower the fuel cost but also reduce GHG and pollutant emissions for remote communities. Besides, syngas-diesel dual fuel combustion can maintain the ability to revert back to diesel operation and therefore ensure reliable heat and power supply when syngas is not available. In this study, the combustion and emissions performance of a syngas-diesel dual fuel engine was investigated at low and medium loads. A single cylinder direct injection diesel engine was modified to operate using a dual fuel strategy. The diesel fuel was directly injected to the cylinder, while syngas was injected into the intake port. The effects of syngas fraction and composition on energy efficiency, cylinder pressure, exhaust temperature, and combustion stability were recorded and analyzed. The emissions data, including PM, NOx, CO, and unburned hydrocarbon, were also analyzed and reported in the paper. The {{results suggest that the}} substitution of diesel by a syngas caused a slight decrease in brake thermal efficiency and an increase in CO emissions. The effect of a syngas on soot emissions depended on the composition and/or quality. The <b>inert</b> component <b>content</b> of a syngas significantly affected NOx emissions in a syngas-diesel dual fuel internal combustion engine. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
30|$|Coal is {{the largest}} fossil fuel abundantly {{distributed}} {{in many parts of}} the world. The demand of energy and the depletion of high-quality coal, so more attention is focused on utilization of the low- grade coal. The low-grade coal has a serious deficiency to utilization because it associated with high mineral matter content and moisture content. The origin of Indian coal is heterogeneous in nature and consists of the complex mixture of organic (carbon) and inorganic (minerals) constituents (Georgakopoulos et al. 2003). The use of low-grade coal in large-scale unit leads to environmental pollution due to generation of the solid wastes and gaseous pollutants. It causes the increase cost of the power plants, reduce the efficiency and produces technical difficulties during processes and production steps (Meshram et al. 2015). It is necessary to demineralize and desulphurize such coal before using in thermal power station, steel plants, or cement industries, etc. The major minerals commonly found in coal are quartz and other forms of silica, clay mineral, pyrites and carbonates such as siderites and ankerites (Mukherjee and Borthakur 2001). The coal ash formed from mineral matter is both organic and inorganic in nature. High ash (>[*] 20 % weight) coal is rich with mineral content such as quartz, illite, calcite, pyrite, gypsum, and elements like H, N, S and oxygen. The high ash coal is always enriched with oxides of SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3, and K 2 O (Ciu et al. 2015). The cleaning of coal can be achieved by both physical and chemical method (Gulen et al. 2005). The degree of demineralization of coal by various method mostly depends on the percentage and composition of mineral matter, their types, and association within the raw coal. The physical methods are based on the difference in their physical properties (specific gravity and surface properties) of the minerals and the carbonaceous part of the coal (Behera et al. 2017 a, b). The chemical method involve treatment with different chemical solvent are used for removing mineral matter, like the finely distributed mineral and those bound strongly to the coal matrix (Ma et al. 2014). The purpose of beneficiation of a low-grade coal is to reduce <b>inert</b> <b>content</b> for easy transportation, minimize abrasive materials and to improve the combustion qualities. The combustion properties of coal like heating value, volatile matter content that govern the performance of coal have a clear dependence on ash, maceral composition. Therefore, more emphasis is given for the cleaning method of coal so that it may minimize the mineral matter and improve the quality of coal. However, chemical cleaning processes are more expensive than physical cleaning steps in terms of total cost (Dash et al. 2015 a, b). The chemical beneficiation methods are include acid leaching, alkali leaching, acid leaching followed by alkali leaching or alkali leaching followed by acid leaching and leaching by molten caustic treatment. The coal cleaning by the chemical method is a simple process when it is operates under mild condition. Chemical leaching process usually achieved remove all types of minerals from the coal compared to physical treatment method. Although, chemical cleaning method has not been widely employed on a commercial scale due to huge cost related to the requirement of chemical and need for dewatering and regeneration of reagents from spent solution (Wu and Steel 2007; Waugh and Bowling 1984; Ryberg et al. 2015; Sriramoju et al. 2017).|$|R
