By this time, the party had nevertheless become the very most popular Flemish party in Belgium, being supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{develops}} {{a theory of}} legislative cooperation in bicameral legislatures. At its core is a distinction between two decision-making scenarios leading to a concurrent majority in the two chambers. In an inter-institutional scenario, the chambers oppose each other as unitary actors. In a trans-institutional scenario, the constituent actors enter into cooperation across the boundaries of their chambers. The central argument is that <b>formateurs</b> face a strategic decision on which of these two routes to take. They can stick to their intra-institutional coalition, or they can abandon it and propose a logroll across issues within a bill that is carried by a majority across the chambers. The thesis comprises three papers, united by the general topic of trans-institutional legislative cooperation, and each demonstrating the crucial role of the <b>formateurs.</b> The empirical analysis focuses on co-decision legislation proposed in the bicameral system of the European Union between 1999 and 2009. In particular, it draws on a new dataset on early-stage and final-stage coalitions in the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. This {{is based on an}} extensive analysis of more than 18, 000 Council documents and 19, 000 amendments in the EP presenting {{for the first time a}} systematic insight into early-stage coalitions. Three central findings emanate from the application of the theoretical framework to the new data. First, <b>formateurs</b> can obtain an outcome closer to their preferences by choosing between inter- and trans-institutional scenarios. Second, the transaction costs of exchanges across institutional boundaries are lower if formateurs’ preferences are similar. Third, the decisions of the <b>formateurs</b> potentially produce winners and losers as some actors are included and others are excluded from the coalitions. These findings build on and further develop theories of bicameral coalition formation and legislative organisation. They highlight that the strategic environment in which actors operate surpasses their individual chamber, and explain how this affects the process and outcome of decision-making. This leads to important empirical and theoretical contributions which raise normative implications...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} a {{model of}} legislative bargaining in which parties form tentative coalitions (protocoalitions) before deciding on the allocation of a resource. Protocoalitions may fail to reach an agreement, in which case they may be dissolved (breakdown) and a new protocoalition may form. We show that agreement is immediate in equilibrium, and the proposer advantage disappears as the breakdown probability goes to zero. We then turn to the special case of apex games and explore the consequences of varying the probabilities that govern the selection of <b>formateurs</b> and proposers. Letting the breakdown probability go to zero, most of the probabilities considered lead to the same ex post pay-off division. Ex ante expected pay-offs may follow a counterintuitive pattern: as the bargaining power of weak players within a protocoalition increases, the weak players may expect a lower pay-off ex ante...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBorn in the USA in the 1980 s- 90 s, then soon {{introduced}} in France, executive coaching arouses {{the development of}} a new professional segment, which is booming in the consulting field in the 2000 s. Identifying the social conditions and the reasons why a set of actors turn to this activity enables to show how this new professional segment strengthens, beyond the action of the first activists who devoted themselves to the promotion and recognition of this activity. Our inquiry shows two main paths to become a coach : coaching first attracts consulting and training experts, and psychologists, who want to unify the numerous activities they have led in their “bushy” professional career; and secondly, executives who turn to this practice as a new job after a professional breakdown that occurred in a pretty stable career. Coaching’s study helps to understand better the elective affinities between the “new spirit of capitalism” (BOLTANSKI, CHIAPELLO, 1999) and professional careers which reveal the forced appeal of hybrid employment statuses that are growing in the grey area between salaried status and self-employment. Développé aux États-Unis dans les années 1980 - 1990, rapidement introduit en France, le coaching en entreprise suscite la constitution d’un segment professionnel en plein essor dans l’espace du conseil des années 2000. Dégager les conditions sociales et les raisons qui conduisent un ensemble d’acteurs à se tourner vers cette activité permet de montrer comment se consolide ce nouveau segment professionnel, au-delà de l’action des premiers militants engagés dans sa reconnaissance.

40|$|International audienceProject-based {{learning}} is fully {{implemented in the}} curricula of French higher education institutions in agribusiness. For 15 years, twelve institutions have developed operational teaching approaches to integrate in their education curriculum participation {{of students in the}} food eco-innovation contest ECOTROPHELIA. Created in 2000, the contest succeeds in mobilizing and facilitating cooperation between higher education and representatives of the food sector to train future executives to business innovation. Recruiters recognize the quality of learning by ECOTROPHELIA projects. Students participate in teams of 3 to 10 to project-based learning, over a period of 8 to 12 months depending on the institution. They face the multidisciplinary complexity of an eco-innovative project: from the idea generation to the industrial transfer. The knowledge and skills acquisition is supported by 'technical' trainers. A coaching device supports students in developing the project specific skills: (i) project management, (ii) leadership, (iii) food eco-innovation approaches. In the framework of the ANR IDEFI ECOTROPHELIA research program (2012 - 2017), 12 higher education institutions are networking to build the referential educational model to support the teaching staff in their supervision of learning during the development of these food eco-innovation projects. Relying on an inventory of practices in 12 partner institutions, the development of a toolbox to serve trainers and students is a key step to ensure the sustainability of these approaches and consider their dissemination to all French food innovation higher education institutions. The construction of the toolbox is based on the opinions of students, collected during an annual survey on 18 teams and 120 students. The toolbox originality is to support students and assist teachers during learning. Designed on a shared digital platform among the 12 institutions, the toolbox aims to respond to several issues: (i) to assist students in the knowledge acquisition required for the achievement of the 10 steps of the project (creativity, market research, formulation, etc.). Students have access to knowledge and a self-learning tool to test their level of its acquisition. (ii) To propose methods to achieve project steps (e. g. development of packaging). (iii) To provide tools (e. g. software) to realize specific actions (e. g. tool for evaluating the environmental impact). (iv) To assist students in individual management skills development. (v) To assist trainers in their practices for supervising students in their projects learning processes through network exchanges. The aim {{of this article is to}} present the collective approach implemented for the design of a toolbox serving students and trainers to support the learning process through innovation projects. The device intends to strengthen the professional dimension of the training, in the center of the strategy of all French institutions of higher education in food innovation.

Pourtant, les recherches ont mis en évidence que, à l'encontre de la figure de l'apprenant isolé, les caractéristiques mêmes de la formation à distance renforcent les exigences de coopération et cela, non seulement pendant la formation, mais aussi dans la phase qui lui succède, à savoir le retour en situation de travail.
