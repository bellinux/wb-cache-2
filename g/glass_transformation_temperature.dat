Phys. 35, 282 (2009)). Researchers have long searched for any {{signature of the}} underlying “true” ergodic–nonergodic transition emerging at a certain thermodynamic instability temperature Te. Here, the relaxation timescale for glass-forming materials is analyzed within a self-consistent thermodynamic cluster description combined with the cluster percolation concept. Exploring the ergodic hypothesis, its violation is found near a crossover from the Gaussian to non-Gaussian (Poisson) cluster-volume fluctuations, describing the finite-size fractal-cluster distributions. The transformation of the compact-structure “ergodic” clusters into hole-like glassy nanoclusters is attributed to the critical-size thermal fluctuations. The ergodic–nonergodic phase diagram showing Te is predicted in the model-independent form through the glass fragility parameter known for organic and inorganic liquids and amorphous solids. In all cases the ergodic-instability temperature is located below {{and close to the}} <b>glass</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>temperature,</b> whereas the distance between the two characteristic temperatures decreases with growing the material fragility...|$|E

In samples devitrified during a UTA run, CaO. SiO 2 crystals form until similar to 50 % CaO amount is substituted (x= 1).

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{proposed}} that, {{as long as}} the glasses of the system Ag 2 O-B 2 O 3 -AgI are demixed on a very fine scale into a silver borate matrix and AgI microdomains, their activation energy for electrical conduction can be considered an average value of the two phases present. These values are taken to be equal to those of silver iodide and of the corresponding undoped silver borate In this light it is expected that, in the compositional range considered the following relation holds: E-sigma/E-sigma ma = R; where E-sigma and E-sigma ma are the activation energies, respectively, of the doped and undoped glass and R is the fraction of Ag+ added as Ag 2 O. Deviations from this 'ideal' behaviour are attributed to the presence, at the boundary of the two phases, of Ag+ in mixed neighbour sites, that is, surrounded by negatively charged structural units of both phases.

The GeO 2 -PbO glass, {{the medium of}} nanoparticle formation, doped with Er 2 O 3, Yb 2 O 3 and AgNO 3 was prepared by a melt quenching method. Annealing of the glass for different times was utilized, not only due to thermally reduce Ag+ ions to Ag nanostructures, but also to influence the glassy network. This is because, the <b>glass</b> structural <b>transformation</b> <b>temperature</b> is near to 435 °C and heating at more than this temperature can cause some structural changes in the glass matrix. According to TEM images, samples that tolerate 450 °C annealing temperature for one hour show the formation of basil-like silver nanostructures with a mean length of 54 nm and mean diameter of 13 nm embedded in the glass matrix, whereas with annealing at 450 °C for 5 to 20 h, silver nanoparticles of about 3 – 4 nm mean diameter size are formed. Annealing for 30 h causes silver nanoparticles to aggregate to form larger particles due to an Oswald ripening process. Observation of the characteristic Ag-NP SPR band at 400 – 500 nm in the UV-visible absorption spectra confirms the existence of silver nanoparticles. The SPR band widens to longer wavelengths in one hour annealed samples, which relates {{to the existence of}} nanostructures with different size or fractal shapes. In addition, an increment in the peak of the SPR band by increasing the duration of annealing indicates the formation of more nanoparticles. Furthermore, the existence of a peak at 470 cm– 1 in the FTIR spectra of annealed samples and its absence in the samples not exposed to an annealing process suggests that the glass matrix is polymerized by Pb-O chains during the 450 °C annealing process. This is the main source of different nanostructures because of the dissimilar stabilizing media. The tighter media cap the particles to form small and dense nanoparticles but a loose environment leads to the creation of basil-like particles in the glass matrix...|$|R

Their behaviour when they were soaked in a simulated body fluid (SBF) and their thermal properties (<b>glass</b> <b>transformation</b> and softening <b>temperatures,</b> T-g and T-s respectively) were studied. T-g and T-s increase with the Y 2 O 3 content. The trend can be explained on the basis of the increased structural rigidity when Ca 2 + ions are substituted by Y 3 + ions, because of the formation of stronger bonds to the oxygen. The bioactivity was studied by means of electron microscopy equipped with an energy dispersive system for elemental analysis and IR spectroscopy. All the glasses studied except the one with the greatest amount of Y 2 O 3, X = 1. 0, reacted with SBF by forming a calcium phosphate layer. The experimental results suggest that the bioactivity is negatively influenced by the Y 2 O 3 content: the tendency to form a calcium phosphate layer is reduced the greater the amount of CaO substituted. A comparison with literature data indicates that the amount of Y 2 O 3 that can be substituted depends on the CaO content of the base CaO-SiO 2 glass. The experimental results are in good agreement with the mechanism reported in the literature.

Substitution of La 2 O 3 for Na 2 O greatly affects the <b>glass</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>temperature,</b> T-g, while for CaO has much less effect. When plotting T-g values as a function {{of composition}} linear trends were in all cases obtained. In the course of substitution the FTIR stretching band of SiO 4 tetrahedra slightly broadens. The results agree well with the hypothesis, based on well known criteria reported in the literature, of the network modifying role for La 2 O 3. Taking into account that when La I ions are hosted in the silicate structure, coordination shells with three nonbridging oxygens must be built tip, the FTIR results {{can be attributed to the}} need of a broader distribution of the nonbridging oxygens among the tetrahedra...|$|E

One type is a microactuator utilizing a Ti-Ni-Pd thin film which has high <b>transformation</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Cooling rate of a microactuator increases with increasing <b>temperature</b> difference between <b>transformation</b> and atmosphere <b>temperatures,</b> thus the increase in <b>transformation</b> <b>temperature</b> is effective to increase the actuation response. The other type is a microactuator using R-phase transformation of a Ti-Ni thin film which has a narrow <b>transformation</b> <b>temperature</b> hysteresis. The narrow <b>transformation</b> <b>temperature</b> hysteresis of the R-phase transformation is effective to increase the actuation response. Both types of actuators are promising for high response applications. The working frequency of the microactuators reached 100 Hz in {{the two types of}} microactuators utilizing the martensitic transformation of the Ti-Ni-Pd thin film and the R-phase transformation of the Ti-Ni thin film...|$|R

The <b>transformation</b> <b>temperature,</b> mechanical properties and recovery strain were studied by using {{differential scanning calorimeter}} and material testing machine. It shows that with Ni/Ti ratio increase, the <b>transformation</b> <b>temperature</b> and mechanical properties decrease. Shape recovery strain is higher when Ni/Ti ratio is 1. 068, with recovery strain range from 6. 8 to 7. 5. The faster the cooling rate after annealing, the higher is the <b>transformation</b> <b>temperature,</b> and the lower are the mechanical properties and recovery strain...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} deals with Ni–Mn–Sn {{compounds}} that present large magnetocaloric effect through a firstorder magnetostructural transition. The {{influence of the}} processing path on the martensitic <b>transformation</b> <b>temperatures</b> was scrutinized by calorimetric measurements. It is shown that the increase of the cooling rate from the annealing temperature brings about a decrease of the martensitic <b>transformation</b> <b>temperatures.</b> All <b>transformation</b> <b>temperatures</b> were also higher {{in the case of}} powdered samples compared to bulk samples. A small variation of the degree of atomic order was highlighted and could be linked to the observed phenomena...|$|R
