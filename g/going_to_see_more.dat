I think you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> comedies.

There was a lot of pushback and people saying, 'Oh, it's going to go away, it's going to go away.' But it didn't go away. It just changed a lot... YouTube has completely changed the way that we experience movies because people are out there making stuff all the time and capturing moments, so there's a certain language that I think we've adopted.

Forsett was then signed from the practice squad on October 14, 2008 and became the return specialist. For the 2009 season, he was slated to compete with Julius Jones and Edgerrin James for touches in a crowded Seahawks backfield. After the release of Edgerrin James, Forsett became the teams No. 2 back which gave him {{an opportunity to get}} more touches and make a bigger on-the-field impact. On November 15, Julius Jones, the starting running back for the Seahawks, left a game against the Arizona Cardinals with a bruised lung. Forsett filled in for Jones, rushing for 123 yards and his first regular season touchdown. He started as the primary running back on November 22 game against the Minnesota Vikings, scoring his second touchdown on a 9-yard run. With the Seahawks' running game struggling, Forsett also caught 8 passes for 80 yards. On November 29 against the St. Louis Rams, he rushed for a career-high 130 yards and two scores.

This is providing a strong political base for expanding the nuclear power capacity because of the critical role that nuclear power plants play in the production of electricity without emissions of greenhouse gases. In all, more than a dozen countries get over 25 % of their energy from nuclear power, with 437 nuclear reactors operating around the world. On top of that, there are another 71 reactors under construction, 165 planned, and 315 proposed. Global uranium demand is expected to rise 40 % by 2025 and 81 % by 2035.

För att avgränsa min undersökning har jag valt att studera utställningen Dröm- mens syster som finns på Världskulturmuseet i Göteborg.

På grund av det resul- tat jag fått hoppas jag att fler {{kommer att}} se möjligheterna i informationsför- medling via sinnen som till exempel auditiv kommunikation. Sound {{is an interesting}} communication media that takes advantage of each persons individual ex- perience and conceptions and allows for many individual associations. Today museums can choo- se {{from a wide range}} of media (pictures, video, sound guides, computer and sound installations) to communicate with their audience because a greater variety of technical solutions is available. This paper has the goal to analys the possibilities of sound as a media of communication. The aim is to shed light on this relativly unexplored field that I think has a lot of potential. To narrow down my exploration, I have chosen to take a closer look at the exhibition Drömmens syster that is shown at the Världskulturmuseet in Gothenburg, Sweden. I have interviewed some key persons behind this exhibition to get an idea about the aim and I have interviewed a number of visitors to get a better understanding of how they experienced the exhibition. The exhibition Drömmens syster is about the more and more endangered people and their myths who live close by the Orinoco river in Venzuela. The conclusion from this essay shows that sound is a good media for communicating informa- tion. It is especially well suited to involve the audience in an experience of rain forest and the daily life around it. The museum suceeds several times to tell more by using sound than by just using pictures. Visitors can gain from the calming effect of the waterfall and they can get thrilled from the hiss of the snake. Therefor I sincerely hope that we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> media con- cepts in the future that use auditive communication...|$|E
40|$|The {{armistice}} after World War II {{marked the}} beginning of an era that was to last {{to the end of the}} present century. It was an era in which many changes in medicine and nursing combined to alter the entire philosophy of managing malignant disease. More specifically, the fluid-phase tumors, which comprise myelodysplasia and the leukemias, were singled out for special attention. First there was the ease with which blood and bone marrow could be sampled, making serial investigations simple and practical. Second, cytotoxic drugs became available ranging from nitrogen mustard through cytosine rabinoside, the anthracycline antibiotics, and the epi-podophyllotoxins. Although cytomorphology of the hematopoietic tissue had been exquisitely defined with the use of Romanowsky stains coupled with electron microscopy, the diagnosis of leukemia was before 1945, a death sentence for want of effective therapy. This changed dramatically with the introduction of the folate antagonists, and progress was unremitting as the range of new products expanded. Suddenly responses could be obtained with single agents, and fairly rapidly combinations were developed for cumulative antitumor effect. Many agents had undesirable toxicity among different organs. Although slightly different for myeloblastic or lymphoblastic variants, this approach produced apparent disease eradication. The concept of complete remission, both clinical and hematologic, was born. Some of our early enthusiasm has had to be tempered with the somber appreciation that not all patients can improve and many others experience relapses. Where then do we stand? Leukemic cells themselves seldom kill. It is the relentless and uncontrolled expansion of a neoplastic clone that leads to bone marrow failure, albeit at different rates in the various subtypes. In the acute forms, the common presentation remain symptomatic anemia, neutropenic sepsis, and thrombocytopenic bleeding. Differentiation from marrow aplasia may not be possible at first on clinical grounds, although bone tenderness, gingival hypertrophy, and skin infiltration are among the general useful different signs. Findings in the circulation and the marrow are of cardinal importance in diagnosis; they provide the basis for classification. Improved accuracy has followed the introduction of cytochemical stains, and a widening range of monoclonal antibodies, and greater recourse to karyotyping, have enhanced diagnostic acumen. Treatment decisions rest on many variables or prognostic factors that include age, performance status, comorbidity, and disease category, with an ever-increasing regard for the part played by cellular and molecular genetics. Despite skillful utilization of this wealth of information for optimal management, outcome often leaves much to be desired. Myelodysplasia encompasses a number of different syndromes in which the refractory anemias are indolent, whereas those with excess blasts progress toward overt leukemia. Considerable judgment is necessary in selecting patients for whom use growth factors that include erythropoietin, granulocyte or granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factors, and thrombopoietin can be justified. The often unfavorable result has been a stimulus to current investigations that examine the value of intensive chemotherapy or the more innovative bone marrow transplantation and its peripheral blood equivalent. Autografting is a newer alternative that does not have proved potential. Acute leukemia, whether myeloblastic or lymphoblastic, has been managed with mixed success. Remission rates have steadily increased and, notably among children, moved toward 100 % in certain groupings. The downside of nonspecific drug regimens is that some patients simply may not respond, whereas others experience remissions and then relapses. Some progress has followed postremission intensification with dosage escalation into ranges that require myeloprotection with growth factors or hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells derived from blood or marrow by means of cell separator technology. Apart from short- and long-term complications and high cost, survival rates, which have undoubtedly improved, are in many categories less than 50 % beyond 5 years. Chronic leukemia is crisply separable into granulocytic or lymphocytic, and management of these conditions has brought, respectively, reward and frustration. In the former, the early promise of interferon has not been fully realized, and although allografting has for the first time produced long and stable disease-free survival periods, the relapse rate is substantial, particularly after T-cell depletion. Nevertheless, the ability to return patients to cytogenetic remission by means of adoptive immunotherapy with mononuclear cells of donor origin, has reawakened interest in the role of this therapy as a more specific tumor-directed intervention. In lymphocytic leukemia, the purine analogues are useful, but cure is rare. Accordingly, feasibility studies have tested the concept that more aggressive efforts to eliminate the disease, followed by grafting, deserve attention. Preliminary data suggest that in some instances lymphocytic leukemia is no longer detectable, even with stringent molecular diagnostic techniques. It seems unlikely that contemporary practices will ever be acceptable, because of their lack of specificity and side effects. All serious students of the hematologic malignant diseases, whether basic or clinical scientists, should rekindle an interest in the physiologic aspects of hematopoiesis at the cellular level. The practicing hematologist and oncologist is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> emphasis on genetics in diagnosis and as a factor in the prediction of results of treatment. Hematologist-oncologists will have the potential to intervene with greater directness in individual cases. For example, maturation-induction with retinoic acid has an established place in therapy for acute progranulocytic leukemia. Antisense oligonucleotides are being explored in a number of different hematologic and other malignant diseases. A variety of biologic reagents are being synthesized to upregulate apoptotic pathways, and immunologic mechanisms are being developed for their antileukemic activity. The 21 st century is confidently expected to witness much closer interdependence between basic scientists and clinicians. Nowhere is this be more evident than in the multidisciplinary management of myelodysplasia and the leukemias. Revie...|$|E

[...] Henderson on John Ross The character of John Ross is very layered. [...] "He's a very, very passionate guy," [...] Henderson said of the character. John Ross has a certain kind of intensity about him. John Ross treats life as a game of chess and does his best to stay a step ahead of everyone. [...] "Ross also wants to one-up J.R." [...] and at the same time, make him proud. [...] "I'm actually nothing like John Ross in that kind of conniving attitude…" [...] Henderson said as he explained the differences between himself and his character. [...] "I don't see John Ross as a bad guy," [...] Henderson said. According to Henderson, the character is very [...] "determined" [...] and understands what he wants. Henderson also described the character as a schemer who is willing to stoop to any low to get what he wants. Whenever John Ross feels trapped, he uses [...] "charm and manipulation" [...] to get what he wants. Taking advice from Hagman himself, Henderson's John Ross relishes being bad and savors every moment of it.

[...] Morgan's All About Soap colleague Carena Crowford felt that was [...] "something suspect" [...] about Doctor Browning. She said Silas was left alone with [...] "the dodgy doc, and the next thing they knew the old man had knocked Browning out, stolen his shoes and run away.

[...] After it was revealed Doctor Browning killed Lynsey, Morgan said she [...] "had the dastardly doc's card marked from day one, but have to admit that tonight's big reveal has left us a bit cold". She said that the murder was [...] "a crime of passion, but there’s no way Mercy is worth killing for. ... Disappointingly, it also transpired that Dr Browning has zilch to do with Silas's epic return. It was a mere coincidence that the medical man was caught up in the serial killer’s escape from hospital. We think it could have made a brilliant twist if Silas had been schooling Dr B, and getting him to carry on his work while he was behind bars".|$|R
