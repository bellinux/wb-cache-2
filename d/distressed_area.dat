Despite {{the success of the}} economically <b>distressed</b> <b>areas</b> program, many Texas residents continue to lack water and wastewater infrastructure. Unless additional funding is provided, many residents of unincorporated and economically <b>distressed</b> <b>areas</b> will be forced to continue to live in communities lacking basic infrastructure. Providing residents access to clean water and adequate sanitation is necessary to promote public health. Many of the communities that lack adequate water and wastewater infrastructure are poor. Building water lines would enable businesses to move into those communities, improving the tax base and creating jobs for residents. The economically <b>distressed</b> <b>areas</b> program benefits the environment by reducing the amount of polluted wastewater discharged into state streams and bays.|$|R

The design of each community development tax expenditure appears to overlap with that {{of at least one}} other tax expenditure in terms of the areas or activities funded. Federal tax laws and regulations permit use of multiple tax expenditures or tax expenditures with other federal spending programs, but often with limits. For instance, employers cannot claim more than one employment tax credit for the same wages paid to an individual. Besides IRS, administering many community development tax expenditures involves other federal agencies as well as state and local governments. For example, the National Park Service oversees preservation standards for the 20 percent historic rehabilitation tax credit. Fragmented administration and program overlap can result in administrative burden, such as applications to multiple federal agencies to fund the needs of a <b>distressed</b> <b>area</b> or finance a specific. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Braddock, Pennsylvania {{is home to}} the Edgar Thomson Steel Works (ETSW), one of the few {{remaining}} active steel mills in the Pittsburgh region. An economically <b>distressed</b> <b>area,</b> Braddock exceeds average annual (> 15 μg/m 3) and daily (> 35 μg/m 3) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM 2. 5). Methods: A mobile air monitoring study was designed and implemented in morning and afternoon hours in the summer and winter (2010 – 2011) to explore the within-neighborhood spatial and temporal (within-day and between-day) variability in PM 2. 5 and PM 10. Results: Both pollutants displayed spatial variation between stops, and substantial temporal variation within and across study days. For summer morning sampling runs, site-specific mean PM 2. 5 ranged from 30. 0 (SD = 3. 3) to 55. 1 (SD = 13. 0) μg/m 3. Mean PM 10 ranged from 30. 4 (SD = 2. 5) to 69. 7 (SD = 51. 2) μg/m 3, respectively. During summer months, afternoon concentrations were significantly lower than morning for both PM 2. 5 and PM 10, potentially owing to morning subsidence inversions. Winter concentrations were lower than summer, on average, and showed lesser diurnal variation. Temperature, wind speed, and wind direction predicted significant variability in PM 2. 5 and PM 10 in multiple linear regression models. Conclusions: Data reveals significant morning versus afternoon variability and spatial variability in both PM 2. 5 and PM 10 concentrations within Braddock. Information obtained on peak concentration periods, and the combined effects of industry, traffic, and elevation in this region informed the design of a larger stationary monitoring network...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{challenges}} and opportunities of the community-based redevelopment model in a neoliberal economic context. Drawing on {{a review of the}} history and theories of redevelopment and governance in the United States, it analyzes the particular case of Jackson Square, a community-led redevelopment process in a low-income neighborhood between Roxbury and Jamaica Plain, in Boston. In an area that was razed {{for the construction of a}} failed highway project in the late 1960 s, a partnership of community development corporations (CDCs) and private developers are struggling to implement a plan that was defined through a public participation process. The Jackson Square case is a paradigmatic example of a highly democratic decision-making process that resulted in a community vision for a <b>distressed</b> <b>area.</b> However, despite ideal community engagement and development by community-based nonprofit organizations, the project is being seriously delayed and downgraded due to an economic recession, while the community is not mobilizing to defend their vision and ask for much-needed public support. Given the structural inequalities engendered by the neoliberal economic system, and the government's retreat from leading the revitalization of distressed neighborhoods, this research questions the present ability of community-led processes to achieve their goals. Through a critical analysis of the role that each group involved is playing, this thesis aims to contribute to the improvement of the community-led redevelopment model in a way that enhances the creation of a more just city. by Patricia Molina Costa.
