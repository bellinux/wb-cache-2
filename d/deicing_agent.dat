40|$|The {{research}} site {{is located in}} Plymouth, Massachusetts, above the Plymouth Carver Aquifer. It is positioned along side State Route 25 which opened {{in the summer of}} 1987 in order to extend Interstate 495 to the Bourne Bridge. Snow/ice removing measures using salt, and an alternate <b>deicing</b> <b>agent,</b> CMA have been practiced since the winter of 1987. The highway runoff is collected into an infiltration basin, allowing salt and CMA to infiltrate the sandy aquifer below. The salt and CMA increase the specific conductivity of the groundwater while, the infiltrated acetate is biodegraded, leading to DO depletion within the aquifer. Once anoxic conditions are reached, any further acetate loaded into the aquifer is degraded anaerobically. The objective of this research was to develop and calibrate, steady state, analytical models of specific conductivity and DO transport through the aquifer. The models feature advection, vertical dispersion and for the dissolved oxygen, first order decay. The vertical dispersivity parameter results would be used in the reactive model because it contributes to the mixing of the plume, therefore accounting for the microbial activity. The data used to calibrate the model included monthly groundwater measurements of specific conductivity and dissolved oxygen collected and analyzed from October 1999 - October 2007. Groundwater quality data were obtained from four clusters of a total of 3 7 monitoring wells that allowed for a more detailed study of the vertical variation of parameters. Other data used in this research included monthly rain data and the Massachusetts Highway Department reports of <b>deicing</b> <b>agent</b> solids applied over seven complete road-deicing seasons. The specific conductivity data calibrate the elevation of the plume bottom, the source concentration C~, and the vertical dispersivity. The bottom elevation decreases with distance from the basin as expected. The result for the second parameter searched in the transport model, C infinity was checked against the expected values based on the average amount of <b>deicing</b> <b>agent</b> applied yearly in the research area section ofSR- 25. If the model is correct and the average C infinity predicted is as much as 1200 microsiemens / cm, then 56 % of the <b>deicing</b> <b>agent</b> material drifted off the highway. The average vertical dispersivity result for all of the well clusters used in this project was 0. 77 m. The first order decay rates results from the reactive transport model, suggest that the decay rate is zero order near the source and first order within time and distance away from the source.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} of bridge maintenance in Iowa is the spalling and scaling of the decks. This problem stems from the continued use of deicing salts during the winter months. Since bridges will frost or freeze more often than roadways, the use of deicing salts on bridges is more frequent. The salt which is spread onto the bridge dissolves in water and permeates into the concrete deck. When the salt reaches {{the depth of the}} reinforcing steel and the concentration at that depth reaches the threshold concentration for corrosion (1. 5 lbs. /yd. 3), the steel will begin to oxidize. The oxidizing steel must then expand within the concrete. This expansion eventually forces undersurface fractures and spalls in the concrete. The spalling increases maintenance problems on bridges and in some cases has forced resurfacing after only a few years of service. There are two possible solutions to this problem. One solution is discontinuing the use of salts as the <b>deicing</b> <b>agent</b> on bridges and the other is preventing the salt from reaching or attacking the reinforcing steel. This report deals with one method which stops the salt from reaching the reinforcing steel. The method utilizes a waterproof membrane on the surface of a bridge deck.

In this research 27 series of pervious concrete were mixed and experimentally tested in their porosity and compressive strength using matrix strength ranging from 29 MPa to 174 MPa, aggregate to binder ratios from 2. 5 to 3. 5 and size of aggregates from 1. 2 mm to 4. 8 mm. A systematic analysis has been carried to out to quantify the influence of matrix strength, amount of binder and size of aggregates on the compressive strength. An extended equation is proposed to better predict the compressive strength. Further investigations have been carried out to predict the stress versus strain behavior under uniaxial compression based on the pore system characteristics. Linear path function, tailored to pervious concrete, was used to extract pore system characteristics such as pore size distribution. A micro structural model was proposed and validated by experimental data to predict the stress-strain relationship under uniaxial compression.

The objectives of this study were to determine the lethal dose range for NaCl in a representative passerine species (house sparrow [Passer domesticus]); to determine the clinical, physiologic, and pathologic effects of sublethal and lethal oral NaCl exposure; and to assess the potential for recovery after exposure to granular salt or highly concentrated salt solutions. The up-and-down method was used in a pilot study to estimate the lethal oral dose of granular NaCl in wild caught house sparrows. The toxicity of highly concentrated NaCl solution also was investigated. This was followed by an acute dose response study in which house sparrows were dosed orally with granular NaCl at 0, 500, 1, 500, 2, 500, or 3, 500 mg/kg. Sparrows were deprived of water for 6 hr postexposure (PE) in an attempt to mimic specific winter conditions.

40|$|Propylene glycol (PG) {{is widely}} used as a {{component}} of <b>deicing</b> <b>agents</b> for aircrafts. Its intensive use in Northern airports is a source of pollution for soil and groundwater even in the presence of recovery systems. Generally PG-based <b>deicing</b> <b>agents</b> are sprayed on the aircrafts over a recovery platform where most of liquids (deicing and melted ice) are collected to a treatment plant. Some of PG is retained by the aircraft wings where it prevents the formation of new ice. During take-off some of PG can drain over the runway and the surrounding soil. In winter the PG is absorbed by the snow layer on the surrounding soil. Melting of snow in spring gives rise to PG percolation in porous soil layers and groundwater underneath. Since PG is toxic to human beings, groundwater pollution has to be prevented. PG is biodegradable by soil bacteria in several environmental conditions. The rate and the extent of biodegradation can be severely limited by many factors, such as temperature, biomass concentration, availability of additional nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus sources) and of electron acceptors (oxygen, nitrate, sulphate, iron and manganese oxides). Enhancing the rate and the extent of biodegradation in the porous unsaturated layer can prevent the pollution of groundwater. In this paper we present experimental data on the biodegradation of PG in soil slurries under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Soil samples from the Gardermoen Airport (Oslo, Norway) have been used as source of PG-degrading microorganisms. The effect of addition of nutrients and electron acceptors different from oxygen has been studied. The rate of degradation is very slow in the absence of added nutrients and follows a zero order kinetics in time both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. It is probably due to maintenance metabolism without biomass growth. By addition of ammonium and phosphate the rate is notably increased and follows first-order kinetics in time. Tentatively an explanation in terms of exponential growth of PG-degrading biomass is postulated. By supplementing oxygen or nitrate, the methanogenic degradation of PG can be prevented, ensuring complete mineralization to water and carbon dioxide...|$|R

40|$|At Luleå airport urea {{is used as}} <b>deicing</b> <b>agent</b> as it dissolves ice {{coatings}} {{by lowering}} the freezing point of water. Urea occur natural in water courses and soils {{as the result of}} excretion and degradation of nucleic acids and proteins. The contents are usually low in the natural environment. Large amount of urea were added because of the deicing, 145 tons in the season 2009 / 2010. Urea consists of 46 % nitrogen which occurs as ammonium whose emissions can lead to eutrophication and can be toxic for organisms in high contents. In a study from SGU in 1996 it was showed that a maximum of 10 % of the urea nitrogen from Luleå airport leaks in to Bottenviken every year, which suggests that {{the main part of the}} urea nitrogen infiltrate into the ground, is taken up by plants or leaves as nitrogen gas through denitrification. Luleå airport has two infiltrations ponds, the north and the south, where all of the airports stormwater sewers link together. Approximately 75 % of the stormwater that drains from Luleå airport runs to the south infiltration pond where an oil trap is placed as a first cleaning step. In 2008 an overflow trench was built between the south infiltration pond and the recipient Lulkroksviken to prevent the flooding that regularly took place, causing forest damages. Only the south infiltration pond with its associated overflow trench was included in this thesis. At the same time as the overflow trench was built a sharp edged weir with a pressure sensor were installed in a well placed at the outlet of the trench to measure the flow that passes. In 2010 a control program to assess the direct emissions from the airport area to the recipient through stormwater started, including regular sampling of the overflow water and analysis of the total nitrogen, total phosphorus, suspended solids, conductivity and pH. Also included in the control program were to sample some elements, PFOS and oil compounds at some occasions to get an entire comprehension of the water quality and possible contaminant transport. The control program for 2010 was performed as a master thesis. The purpose with the thesis was to identify potential contaminations, quantify emissions of the analyzed elements and pollutions to the recipient. A part of the thesis work has been to quality assurance the flow measurements. The sample program focused on nitrogen because urea is used as <b>deicing</b> <b>agent</b> at the airports runway, taxiways and aprons. The results showed that approximately 1 ton of nitrogen passed through the overflow trench and run out into Lulkroksviken. The fraction for October is roughly equivalent with earlier surveys. The analyses of total phosphorus and the elements showed low values except from copper. The oil compounds were under the reporting limit. PFOS was found in the water with an average concentration of 140 ng/l and their source is uncertain. The pressure sensor from Norconsult that measured the over flow has under October given 1. 2 - 2. 3 times larger over flow value than the pressure sensor from ISCO that was installed under the same time.

While the overall contribution to flow volume on the Monongahela River is small, studying {{the water quality}} of the Nine Mile Run Watershed can serve as an example for other tributaries and local rivers in similar settings. Study results could provide data and evidence for future grants, further infrastructure improvement, and improvement to the health and drinking water quality of Pittsburgh and waters downstream on the Ohio River. To accomplish a characterization of water quality and identification of sources of impairment, bimonthly samples were taken from September 2010 through May 2011 at 11 locations along Nine Mile Run and its tributaries. Sampling sites were strategically located to analyze contamination from three main sources including, a combined sewer overflow (CSO) outfall, Hot Dog Dam, and traffic from Forbes Avenue and I- 376. During each sampling period, field and lab measurements were conducted for each sample site. In comparison to its Frick Park tributaries, NMR displayed higher pH, TDS, and bacterial counts throughout the study. Sodium and chloride concentrations were also higher in NMR during colder months due to <b>deicing</b> <b>agent</b> application on adjacent roadways.

In particular, during the 1941 winter months the United States began to apply a total of 5, 000 tons of road salts {{all over the}} country. The effectiveness of road salts was and still is to this day significant in dealing with winter driving conditions and has made roads safer for drivers all over the country. In addition to their use as a <b>deicing</b> <b>agent,</b> they have also been used for dust suppression on non-paved roads as a means of decreasing dust levels in the air. The main salts applied include Magnesium Chloride (MgCl 2), Calcium Chloride (CaCl 2) and Sodium Chloride (NaCl), all of which have been documented in exhibiting adverse affects towards the environment. Many of them have led to high levels of Chloride, Magnesium, Calcium and Sodium within watersheds, aquatic ecosystems and roadside vegetation. Salinity has increased as well within fresh water systems and may even pose a threat to drinking water resources in certain areas depending on location and geological settings. Although the tribulations exist, the amount of research is minimal and the current research suggests that the level of positive impacts from applying the salts outweigh the negatives. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not have regulations for road salts, although they encourage proper management of the application of them. In addition, the environmental affects must be strongly considered when using them in large quantities. This paper looks specifically at MgCl 2 as a road salt both in the literature research provided and personal sampling. Chosen samples were taken of the water and soil around the snow pile where Durango Colorado dumps their annual winter snow. Some levels were noted higher than others particularly magnesium at 5200 ppm in the water sample compared to the water control at 3110 ppm. Due a lack of baseline data regarding natural levels of magnesium and chloride within watersheds, these results could not be compared to or concluded as “toxic” or “alarming”.

Despite growing research concerning ecological impacts of roads, our understanding of long-term consequences remains nascent. This stems in part from a dearth of investigations, {{and in part because}} ecological research typically ignores evolution on contemporary timescales. Yet reports of evolution influencing ecological outcomes are growing, suggesting this influence may be the rule rather than the exception. This may be especially true for species with spatially structured populations. For amphibians, such structuring coupled with environmental heterogeneity has been shown to yield contemporary evolutionary responses, with rates of divergence matching that of environmental disturbance. This suggests that amphibians dwelling in roadside wetlands may evolve rapidly as a consequence of novel selection pressures, such as runoff. I evaluated this potential response using a field-based reciprocal transplant experiment. I compared growth, survival, and development of embryonic and larval wood frogs originating from five roadside and five woodland wetlands. Concomitantly, I conducted chronic and acute road salt exposure experiments with wood frog embryos and larvae originating from the same suite of wetlands. |$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to relate the chloride concentration of highway runoff through specific conductivity measurements and to characterize the role that the pavement surface texture has in the dissolution kinetics of the chloride residing in this layer. The quantity of deicing agents applied throughout the winter season is correlated to the concentration of chloride in highway runoff and linked to the length of time since application. A unit hydrograph was developed from precipitation measurements and the resulting hydraulic parameters were calibrated for use in a specific conductivity flux model. From this model a pollutograph was developed characterizing a specific conductivity flux source term and a first flush value. These two terms are optimized to characterize the dissolution kinetics and predict chloride runoff concentrations. The runoff decay constants optimized for all three sites reduced to very similar averages of 3. 02 x 10 - 4, 4. 21 x 10 - 4, and 3. 6 x 10 - 4 s- 1 respectively for Andover, Cohasset and Plymouth from ranges of three orders of magnitude for each site between individual events over the five year period. The depression storage layers were 0. 9, 1. 3, and 3. 0 mm respectively for Andover, Cohasset and Plymouth indicating a connection between pavement age and texture as Andover is the new of all pavements. Along with the similar calibrated hydraulic parameters, the three sites had very similar optimized chloride source parameters of 5. 64 x 10 - 4, 1. 30 x 10 - 4, and 2. 16 x 10 - 4 mg/m 2 -s for Andover, Cohasset and Plymouth respectively. The 177 storms modeled between all three sites had source terms ranging from 10 - 3 to 10 - 8 and averaged to the above optimized values. A clear indication the lumped parameter linear reservoir approach is applicable to storage facilities and active highway routes. This research provides support understanding the role impervious surface texture has in the chloride dissolution kinetics controlling stormwater runoff quality. A common model {{has been shown to be}} able to characterize stormwater runoff hydraulics and chloride flux from both salt storage facilities and heavily traveled highway lanes. Seasonal stormwater quality trends as well as event first flush concentrations have been identified and characterized with calibrated watershed parameters. Automated samplers coupled with continuous monitoring equipment have shown per storm or seasonal correlation between pavement texture, meteorological data, distributed <b>deicing</b> <b>agent</b> data, and water quality information at different Eastern Massachusetts locations...|$|E
40|$|The {{durability}} of concrete {{is one of}} the most concerns of researchers andengineers. Early ages are the time concrete suffers from many factors those inducecracking in the concrete. Microcracking in concrete adversely affects macroscopic tensilestrength of concrete that will leads to the severe cracking in later ages. Especially with theaddition of mineral additives such as ground granulated blast furnace slag or fly ash,concrete is susceptible to microcracking particularly under temperature variation. Thesemicrocracks must be one of the causes of severe macrocracks observed in real structuresusing slag concrete. Not only microcracking, chloride attack {{is one of the}} main factors lowering the{{durability of}} concrete structures, particularly for the structures in very cold region, wheredeicing agent is frequently used in winter. <b>Deicing</b> <b>agent</b> can cause severe deterioration ofconcrete structures such as scaling, corrosion of steels, and ASR. This study deals with improvement of cracking and chloride penetration resistanceof slag and fly ash concrete by using a new type of cement named high alite cement (HAC). HAC is newly developed Portland cement with very high alite (3 CaO. SiO 2) content andalmost no belite (2 CaO. SiO 2). Due to its sensitivity and the rich information it yields from collected parameters,the acoustic emission (AE) technique has been widely used to detect cracking in hardenedconcrete. Nevertheless, AE measurement at a very early age is difficult because AE sensorscannot be directly attached on the surface of unhardened concrete. Therefore, a waveguideembedded inside concrete has been employed. Unfortunately, attenuation of acousticwaves in high moisture content ambient led to the diminished effectiveness of thewaveguide in detecting AE signals in concrete with high water to binder ratio (W/B). One part of the research is to solve the problem of attenuation. An addition of twoperpendicular bars on main rod of the waveguide was proposed. Due to these wings, thedistance from cracking points in concrete to waveguide was significantly reduced. It wasproved that the redesigned waveguide worked more effectively than the previous one,especially in concrete with high W/B. By using this redesigned waveguide, microcracking was intensively investigatedin slag concrete with W/B of 0. 3 and 0. 5 subjected to temperature history simulating steamcuring. In all types of concrete, the replacement ratio of slag for cement was 50 %. Becausethe coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of materials is one of the important parametersaffecting microcracking in concrete, two types of coarse aggregate with the samemaximum particle size of 19 mm but remarkably different CTEs, namely limestone andandesite were used in the study. The test results showed that net shrinkage of HAC mortar with W/B of 0. 3 wasmuch larger than that of OPC mortar because of its larger autogenous shrinkage. Normally,larger shrinkage of mortar results in more extensive cracking in concrete. However, thenumber and the degree of microcracks in HAC slag concrete with W/B of 0. 3 were smallerthan those in OPC slag concrete. This means that HAC slag concrete with W/B of 0. 3 obviously achieved larger resistance against microcrack than OPC slag concrete. On theother hand, net shrinkage of HAC mortar with W/B of 0. 5 was a bit smaller than that ofOPC mortar due to its smaller thermal contraction. Therefore, microcracking in HAC slagconcrete with W/B of 0. 5 was also smaller than that in OPC slag concrete. The interesting characteristic of HAC explored in the research is that it couldimprove resistance against microcracking in slag concrete. AE data revealed HACconcretes could disperse tensile stress, leading to the formation of many small cracks ratherthan concentrating tensile stress to create a severe crack. Evenly distributed calciumhydroxide (CH) crystals acting as a kind of buffer that prevents the propagation ofmicrocracks in HAC slag concrete might be one of the reasons. Another reason for the highcracking resistance of HAC slag concrete was the strong bond between mortar and coarseaggregate. This high bond strength was more clearly observed in concrete with low W/Bthan in concrete with high W/B. The high bond strength of HAC slag concrete was verifiedthrough tensile strength test, AE test, visual observation, and scanning electron microscopeimages. The strong bond in HAC slag concretes might be due to the formation ofsecondary CSH gel from the reaction of CH and active SiO 2 in slag at pores near theinterface transition zone. The effects of fly ash on the microcracking resistance of concrete subjected totemperature variation at very young ages were also investigated by AE, physical and mechanical tests. Fly ash was used as a cementitious material as well as fine aggregate. Inaddition, a combination of fly ash and HAC, which was effective in improving resistanceagainst microcracking in slag concrete, was studied. Concrete containing fly ash was not so weak against elevated temperature. Nevertheless, fly ash reduced tensile strength of concrete remarkably. The reason is that flyash is not so active in early ages even under steam curing. It is found that HAC can significantly improve tensile strength of concretecontaining fly ash due to high hydration rate of HAC. However, high bond strength in HAC fly ash concrete was not observed from the direct tensile test as in HAC slag concrete. Further research is necessary to clarify the cracking resistance of fly ash concrete. Another important part of the research is to show the effectiveness of HAC toimprove the resistance against chloride ingress of concrete containing additives by using HAC. The effectiveness was analyzed by Surface Water Absorption Test (SWAT) andwater/chloride penetration depth test. Four types of binder were used: OPC, HAC, slag,and fly ash. Concrete with OPC only was the control mix. In other mixes, the cementswere replaced by slag or fly ash with the replacement ratios of 40 % or 15 % by mass,respectively. Coarse aggregate of andesite with maximum particle size of 19 mm was used. Air content of concrete was controlled at 6 ? 0. 5 % to prevent concrete from scaling underfreeze/thaw cycles. In order to obtain a wide range of concrete quality, three W/B of 0. 4, 0. 5, and 0. 6 and five curing conditions covering from very good to very poor conditionwere applied. Three-binder concretes containing slag and fly ash with W/B of 0. 4 werealso prepared. To investigate the effect of bond on mass transfer in concrete, someconcretes made with limestone were added in the cases of concrete with W/B of 0. 4 and 0. 5. Experimental results presented that there were good correlations between waterabsorption rate at 10 minutes (p 600) and penetration depth of water and chloride ions in allkinds of concrete. It means that SWAT can be applied to evaluate the resistance againstmass transfer into concrete. The same linear relationship was observed between the waterpenetration depth and p 600 regardless of the type of binder. It means that p 600 is related to akind of governing characteristic regarding the microstructure of concrete, which should be studied further. The effects of curing conditions were fully reflected in SWAT results. Iflinear lines expressing the correlations between SWAT index and parameters related todurability of concrete such as penetration depth of water or chloride ion, carbonation depth,etc. are established, SWAT index can be used as an indicator of durability of concretestructures. This is very significant because SWAT is a simple, automatic, and rapid methodand it is easy to be applied for concrete structures in actual sites. It is found that slag or fly ash could improve the resistance against chlorideingress of concrete remarkably due to the chloride binding ability of C 3 A componentexisting in slag and fly ash. However, OPC concretes containing additives were much moresensitive to curing conditions than concretes with OPC only. Owing to the high hydration rate of C 3 S, HAC slag/fly ash concrete was lesssensitive to curing conditions than OPC slag/fly ash. Thus, HAC should be utilized withslag or fly ash in concrete structures subjected to severe conditions...|$|E

The purpose of our research was to study each compound within the framework of where and how they are environmental concerns by (1) investigating the influence of soil environmental variables on the degradation and mobility of MeBr in soil and (2) evaluating the use of vegetation to reduce soil infiltration and remediate soil and surface waters contaminated with aircraft <b>deicing</b> <b>agents</b> (EG, PG). Our research indicates MeBr rapidly volatilized from fumigated soil and both volatility and degradation significantly increased with temperature (35 ° C 3 ̆e 25 ° C 3 ̆e 15 ° C) and moisture (- 3 kPa 3 ̆e- 33 kPa 3 ̆e- 300 kPa water potential).

40|$|<b>Deicing</b> <b>agents</b> {{have been}} used to control ice {{build-up}} on roads in winter for at least five decades in North America and Europe. This legacy of contamination of streams and wetlands threatens the availability of fresh water in these regions. The issue is of interest because amphibian skin and membranes of amphibian eggs are highly permeable, rendering amphibians particularly sensitive to chemical contaminants. In addition, saline solutions can travel nearly 200 m from roads and into wetlands, thereby contaminating amphibian habitats. The objective of this study was examine the effects of road salt on an amphibian that breeds in permanent wetlands, the Green Frog (Rana clamitans), for comparison with prior research on vernal pool-breeding species. Survival in all five ecologically-relevant treatment levels was > 93 % in embryos and > 87 % in larvae. However, when accounting for malformations, survival at the highest treatment level (3000 μS conductivity) dropped to 80 % and 82 %, respectively. Larval growth was unaffected by road salt, but 15 % of larvae were malformed at the highest conductivity level. Rana clamitans appears to be relatively tolerant to road salt at low and moderate concentrations and less sensitive than other North American amphibians. At conductivity levels observed in the field, it is unlikely that road salt currently impacts populations of R. clamitans. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

In Massachusetts, {{the rate of}} application of <b>deicing</b> <b>agents</b> is about 240 lb (110 kg) of sand and 12 lb (5. 5 kg) of NaCl per lane mile (1. 6 km). The objective {{of this research was}} to examine injury to plants along roadsides and to assess relationships of damage to the amount of Na detected in plants and soils. The damage on most plant species was manifested as burning or browning of the leaves or needles. Coniferous species, especially pines (Pinus spp.), were sensitive to NaCl injury. In coniferous species, the damage appeared as browning on the ends of the needles, but new growth was not affected. Most of the damage occurred on the needles on the tree side that faced the road and where salt spray from cars or plows could have been a factor in the degree of damage. Widespread damage was also seen on spruce (Picea spp.), sumac (Rhus typhina), and mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia) along roadsides. With sumac, injured plants had only 10 % of the foliage as uninjured plants. Some salt-tolerant species, apparently undamaged by NaCl, in the same vicinity as the damaged plants, were various oaks (Quercus spp.), maples (Acer spp.), grasses (mixed species), ferns (mixed species), and yarrow (Achillea millefolium).
