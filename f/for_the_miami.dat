5|$|During the 2010 NBA offseason, LeBron James and Zydrunas Ilgauskas left Cleveland <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Miami</b> Heat, {{which led}} several other {{veterans}} to also leave the team.

5|$|New York {{decided to}} hire a general manager {{for the first time}} in {{franchise}} history following the 1978 season.

Rozelle recommended George Young, who worked in personnel <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Miami</b> Dolphins and had been an assistant coach for the Baltimore Colts.

5|$|A blocked {{field goal}} and extra-point attempt {{provided}} {{the margin of}} victory <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Miami</b> Dolphins. Ex-Dolphin receiver Morris Owens came back to haunt his old team with three touchdown catches. Starting quarterback Parnell Dickinson threw the first, then was replaced by recently acquired quarterback Terry Hanratty after injuring his ankle. When Hanratty proved ineffective, Steve Spurrier, who had not practiced during the week due to a swollen knee, came off the bench to throw the final two touchdowns. It took a final-minute, 55-yard Garo Yepremian field goal to clinch the game for the Dolphins, whose pass defense had been decimated by injuries. 192 of the Buccaneers’ 334 total yards came through the air. John McKay would later point to this game as {{the high point of}} the Buccaneers’ season. Dolphins linebacker Nick Buoniconti saw it differently, calling the narrow victory “a disgrace” and “the low point in Miami Dolphins’ history”.|$|E
5|$|James played {{high school}} {{basketball}} at St. Vincent–St. Mary High School {{in his hometown of}} Akron, Ohio, where he was highly promoted in the national media as a future NBA superstar. After graduating, he was selected by his home team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. James led Cleveland to the franchise's first Finals appearance in 2007, ultimately losing to the San Antonio Spurs. In 2010, he left the Cavaliers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Miami</b> Heat in a highly publicized ESPN special titled The Decision. James spent four seasons with the Heat, reaching the Finals all four years and winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. In 2013, he led Miami on a 27-game winning streak, the third longest in league history. Following his final season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers. From 2015 to 2017, he led the Cavaliers to three consecutive Finals, winning his third championship in 2016 to end Cleveland's 52-year professional sports title drought.|$|E

5|$|The 1966 Liberty Bowl was a post-season American college {{football}} bowl {{game between the}} Virginia Tech Hokies and the Miami Hurricanes at Memphis Memorial Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee on December 10, 1966. The game was the final contest of the 1966 {{college football}} season for both teams, and ended in a 14–7 victory <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Miami</b> Hurricanes. A then-record 39,101 tickets were sold for the game, but due to 36-degree temperatures at game time, only 25,012 spectators attended. The game marked just {{the second time that}} Virginia Tech had played in a bowl game since the creation of the team in 1892. The game also marked the second time in each school's history that the two teams had faced each other. The previous meeting, held in 1953, ended in a 26–0 shutout victory for the Hurricanes. Current Virginia Tech head football coach and then-player Frank Beamer participated in the game as a backup cornerback for the Hokies.|$|E
5|$|The {{night after}} the Miami Showband massacre, gunmen opened fire on a minibus near Gilford. It had been {{travelling}} from Banbridge to Bleary with nine people on board; all were Catholics and most had been returning from a regular bingo session. One report says it was stopped at a fake British Army checkpoint. Five Catholic civilians were shot; passenger Joseph Toland was killed outright and driver James Marks died of his wounds in January 1976. The attack was blamed on loyalists and Lost Lives—an account of every death in the conflict—states that reliable loyalist sources have confirmed the UVF was responsible. However, police have blamed the IRA. The RUC suggested the IRA had meant to attack a police minibus in revenge <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Miami</b> killings, but had mistakenly attacked a civilian minibus instead. A report by the police's Historical Enquiries Team (HET) also suggests this. The IRA has denied responsibility.|$|E
