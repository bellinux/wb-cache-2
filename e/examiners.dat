5|$|The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) medical <b>examiners</b> {{identified}} most of {{the bodies}} within 10 weeks of the accident. Due to extreme impact forces only one body was identifiable by sight. For approximately 100 bodies, the <b>examiners</b> used DNA; the DNA analysis {{has been referred to}} as the largest DNA identification project in Canadian history. About 90 bodies were identified by Canadian medical <b>examiners</b> using dental records. For around 30 bodies, <b>examiners</b> used fingerprints and ante mortem (before death) X-rays. The large number of ante mortem dental X-rays meant that around 90 bodies had been identified by the end of October. The RCMP contacted relatives of victims to ask for medical histories and dental records. Blood samples from relatives were used in the DNA identification of victims.|$|E

5|$|Federal <b>examiners</b> had the {{authority}} to register voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls. The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to vote by engaging in discriminatory behavior in the voter registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the voter rolls, and limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal <b>examiners</b> were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year that a federal examiner registered a person to vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.|$|E

5|$|Rescue {{workers at}} the World Trade Center site began to {{discover}} body fragments from Flight11 victims {{within days of the}} attack. Some workers found bodies strapped to airplane seats and discovered the body of a flight attendant with her hands bound, suggesting the hijackers might have used plastic handcuffs. Within a year, medical <b>examiners</b> had identified the remains of 33victims who had been on board Flight11. They identified two other Flight11 victims, including purser Karen Martin, in 2006, while other unrelated body fragments were discovered near Ground Zero around the same time. In April 2007, <b>examiners</b> using newer DNA technology identified another Flight11 victim. The remains of two hijackers, potentially from Flight11, were also identified and removed from Memorial Park in Manhattan. The remains of the other hijackers have not been identified and are buried with other unidentified remains at this park.|$|E

5|$|After its {{enactment}} in 1965, the law immediately decreased {{racial discrimination}} in voting. The suspension of literacy tests and assignments of federal <b>examiners</b> and observers allowed for {{high numbers of}} racial minorities to register to vote. Nearly 250,000 African Americans registered in 1965, one-third of whom were registered by federal <b>examiners.</b> In covered jurisdictions, less than one-third (29.3%) of the African American population was registered in 1965; by 1967, this number increased to more than half (52.1%), {{and a majority of}} African American residents became registered to vote in 9 of the 13 Southern states. Similar increases were seen in the number of African Americans elected to office: between 1965 and 1985, African Americans elected as state legislators in the 11 former Confederate states increased from 3 to 176. Nationwide, the number of African American elected officials increased from 1,469 in 1970 to 4,912 in 1980. By 2011, the number was approximately 10,500. Similarly, registration rates for language minority groups increased after Congress enacted the bilingual election requirements in 1975 and amended them in 1992. In 1973, the percent of Hispanics registered to vote was 34.9%; by 2006, that amount nearly doubled. The number of Asian Americans registered to vote in 1996 increased 58% by 2006.|$|E

5000|$|Confrontation {{visual field}} exam (Donders' test): The <b>examiner</b> {{will ask the}} patient to cover one eye {{and stare at the}} <b>examiner.</b> Ideally, when the patient covers their right eye, the <b>examiner</b> covers their left eye, and vice versa. The <b>examiner</b> will then move his hand out of the patient's visual field and then bring it back in. Commonly the <b>examiner</b> will use a slowly wagging finger or a hat pin for this. The patient signals the <b>examiner</b> when his hand comes back into view. This is {{frequently}} done by an <b>examiner</b> as a simple and preliminary test.|$|R
5|$|Forensic firearm {{examination}} is {{the forensic}} process of examining {{the characteristics of}} firearms {{as well as any}} cartridges or bullets left behind at a crime scene. Specialists in this field are tasked with linking bullets and cartridges to weapons and weapons to individuals. Obliterated serial numbers can be raised and recorded in an attempt to find the registered owner of the weapon. <b>Examiners</b> can also look for fingerprints on the weapon and cartridges, and then viable prints can be processed through fingerprint databases for a potential match.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{received}} the final {{part of his}} father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich, Germany. Hitler was called up for conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army, so he journeyed to Salzburg on 5 February 1914 for medical assessment. After he was deemed by the medical <b>examiners</b> as unfit for service, he returned to Munich. Hitler later claimed {{that he did not}} wish to serve the Habsburg Empire because of the mixture of races in its army and his belief that the collapse of Austria-Hungary was imminent.|$|E

5|$|Other offices {{included}} the sworn clerks, the <b>examiners,</b> the clerk to the barons, and the clerk to the King's Remembrancer. There were eight sworn clerks, so called {{because they were}} sworn officers of the court, who held their offices for life and worked under the Remembrancer. Each clerk acted as {{an attorney for the}} parties in court, and every party was required to employ one. The first clerk was known as the First Secondary, and administered oaths out of the Red Book of the Exchequer. The sworn clerks were assisted by 24side clerks, of whom each sworn clerk appointed three. Each side clerk studied under a sworn clerk for five years before practising himself, although under the sworn clerk's name. A side clerk had the chance of being promoted to sworn clerk, first by the Remembrancer and then by the sworn clerks themselves. The <b>examiners</b> were tasked with supervising depositions of witnesses, bringing the witness to a Baron, administering the oath and keeping the files of the depositions. In 1624 it was decided these <b>examiners</b> should be sworn officers of the court, and from then on each Baron had an examiner, who acted in the Baron's name. The office of examiner was dissolved in 1841, when the equity jurisdiction of the Exchequer came to an end. In addition to an examiner, each Baron had at least one clerk, who acted as their private secretary; although not paid, they were authorised to take fees for their work. The Chief Baron had two clerks, while the puisne Barons had one each. The King's Remembrancer also employed a clerk, who was also a secretary. He received no salary and was not a sworn officer of the court, meaning the Remembrancer could have him replaced at any time.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his time}} at the college Ketèlbey wrote lighter, mostly mandolin-based, compositions. As he still aspired to be a serious composer, he adapted the {{pseudonym}} Raoul Clifford in an effort to distance himself from the genre. On leaving the college he became one of its <b>examiners</b> in harmony. He wrote piano pieces as part of his role, and used the pseudonym Anton Vodorinski for the work; he subsequently used the name for more serious works, which he published with French titles.|$|E
5|$|According to Diane Dimond of Hard Copy, Torbiner's {{records show}} that Robinul and Vistarol was {{administered}} instead of sodium amytal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was investigating Torbiner's administration of drugs in house calls, where he mostly gave patients morphine and Demerol. His credentials with the Board of Dental <b>Examiners</b> indicated that he was restricted by law to administering drugs solely for dental-related procedures, {{but he had not}} adhered to those restrictions. For instance, he had given general anesthetic to Barry Rothman during hair-transplant procedures. Torbiner had introduced Chandler and Rothman in 1991, when Rothman needed dental work.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{relationships}} between candidate and <b>examiner</b> characteristics, {{the texts of}} <b>examiner</b> reports on Ph. D. theses and <b>examiner</b> recommendations made on theses. The data were related to 804 <b>examiner</b> reports on 301 theses submitted at three Australian universities. Thesis topics ranged across ten Broad Fields of Study or discipline areas. Simple bivariate analyses were first undertaken to identify candidate, <b>examiner</b> and university variables {{significantly related to the}} <b>examiner</b> recommendation—three candidate variables, <b>examiner</b> location and, in some cases, the university attended were identified. Next, these variables were regressed on <b>examiner</b> recommendation. The text categories were then factor analysed to confirm five constructs identified in previous work—positive summation, negative summation, prescription, formative evaluation and dialogic elements. These were added to the regression equation. A multilevel regression analysis with <b>examiner</b> recommendation as response variable indicated that four of the five constructs (not including the dialogic elements construct), holding a scholarship and two examiner-country variables explained a total of 43 % of the variance in <b>examiner</b> recommendation on the thesis. Implications of the results are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after his arrival, Hess began exhibiting amnesia, {{which may have}} been feigned in the hope of avoiding the death sentence. Medical personnel who examined Hess reported he was not insane and was fit to stand trial. At least two <b>examiners,</b> the British doctor and the Soviet one, noted their belief that Hess's amnesia might be fake. Efforts were made to trigger his memory, including bringing in his former secretaries and showing old newsreels, but he persisted in showing no response to these stimuli. When Hess was allowed to make a statement to the tribunal on 30 November, he admitted that he had faked memory loss as a tactic. He spoke to the tribunal again on 31 August 1946, the last day of closing statements.|$|E
5|$|By {{examining}} unique striations, or markings, {{left behind}} on the bullet as it passes through the barrel and on the cartridge as it is hit by the firing pin, individual spent rounds can be linked back to a specific weapon. Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a comparison microscope. Striation images can also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings {{can be compared to}} other images in an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm <b>examiners</b> are subject to being called to testify in court as expert witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Geotaphonomy is the {{examination}} of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body. By examining these characteristics, <b>examiners</b> can begin to piece together a timeline of the events during and after death. This can potentially help determine the time since death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton {{was a result of}} peri or post-mortem activity, as well as if scattered remains were the result of scavengers or a deliberate attempt to conceal the remains by an assailant.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, the {{new film}} studio Photo Chemical Laboratories, known as P.C.L. (which later became the major studio, Toho), advertised for {{assistant}} directors. Although he had demonstrated no previous interest in film as a profession, Kurosawa submitted the required essay, which asked applicants to discuss the fundamental deficiencies of Japanese films {{and find ways to}} overcome them. His half-mocking view was that if the deficiencies were fundamental, {{there was no way to}} correct them. Kurosawa's essay earned him a call to take the follow-up exams, and director Kajirō Yamamoto, who was among the <b>examiners,</b> took a liking to Kurosawa and insisted that the studio hire him. The 25-year-old Kurosawa joined P.C.L. in February 1936.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of Århus {{performed}} a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman. Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked millet and blackberries. Her neck had a faint groove {{as if someone}} applied a rope for torture or strangulation. The scientists concluded bog acids caused the swelling of the knee joint and that the woman was probably already dead before the branches pinned her down. Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the <b>examiners</b> guess the Haraldskær Woman {{was a victim of}} ritual sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany.

At autopsy, medical <b>examiners</b> found that both the head and shoulders of the fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
