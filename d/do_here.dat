500|$|Later reviews {{were also}} complimentary. VanDerWerff gave the episode an [...] "A" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "a {{good example of the}} show heading in a {{different}} direction but still largely feeling like the same show." [...] He praised the episode for being [...] "fun [...] creepy". VanDerWerff also praised the final scene, noting that [...] "rare that Mulder and Scully completely get played, but they <b>do</b> <b>here,</b> and it makes the episode an even better sick joke." [...] Ultimately, he praised the [...] "sick sense of humor", the [...] "outright left turns into demented darkness", and [...] "the horrifying visuals". Shearman and Pearson awarded the episode five stars out of five, citing the [...] "very good" [...] conceit about organized religion, the humor, and the [...] "great set pieces" [...] as positive factors.|$|E

500|$|Medieval author Christine de Pizan {{solicited}} the Queen's patronage {{at least}} three times. In 1402 she sent a compilation of her literary argument Querelle du Roman de la Rose—in which she questions the concept of courtly love—with a letter exclaiming [...] "I am firmly convinced the feminine cause is worthy of defense. This I <b>do</b> <b>here</b> and have done with my other works." [...] In 1410 and again in 1411, Pizan solicited the Queen, presenting her in 1414 an illuminated copy of her works. In The Book of the City of Ladies, Pizan praised Isabeau lavishly, {{and again in the}} illuminated collection, The Letter of Othea, which scholar Karen Green believes for de Pizan is [...] "the culmination of fifteen years of service during which Christine formulated an ideology that supported Isabeau's right to rule as regent in this time of crisis." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "This episode will strike a chord with anyone that's ever tried {{to fit in with}} the crowd [...] Lisa gets to show the many facets of her character, and there's a superb slapstick sequence as Homer tries to dispose of a firework." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times praised the episode and said: [...] "The episode is quite simply my favourite Lisa episode regardless of season. From calm to cool and fiercely aggressive, we've rarely seen Lisa so enticing as we <b>do</b> <b>here,</b> and the episode's many elements including the side stories for the other family members culminate in one of the finest this season has to offer." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he likes how it addresses Bart's resentment of Lisa's popularity. [...] "Granted, it makes [...] a little too mean, but it's entertaining", he added. Jacobson went on to say: [...] "Marge gets the best moment again, as I love watching her non-violent approach to the bumper cars." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best parts of the episode to be the scenes that feature Milhouse, particularly his yearbook message to Lisa and the scene with the Mystery Date board game. She concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of A.|$|E

2500|$|In {{summarizing}} the biographical works on Gandhi, Blema S. Steinberg concluded she was decidedly non-ideological. Only 7.4% (24) {{of the total}} 330 biographical extractions posit ideology {{as a reason for}} her policy choices. Steinberg noted Gandhi's association with socialism was superficial; only having a general and traditional commitment to the ideology, by way of her political and family ties. Gandhi personally had a fuzzy concept of socialism. In one of the early interviews she had given as Prime Minister, Gandhi had ruminated: [...] "I suppose you could call me a socialist, but you have understand what we mean by that term...we used the word [...] because it came closest to what we wanted to <b>do</b> <b>here</b> – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy, I don't see why we should use it. I don't believe in words at all." [...] Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack of thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon. She has been described by Hindustan Times columnist, Pankaj Vohra as [...] "arguably the greatest mass leader of the last century." [...] Her campaign slogan, Garibi Hatao (Eng: Remove Poverty), has become the iconic motto of the Indian National Congress. To the rural and urban poor, untouchables, minorities and women in India, Gandhi was [...] "Indira Amma or Mother Indira." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Coachman {{was first}} made by John Haily a {{professional}} fly dresser living in New York City. In writing of other matters, he enclosed this fly {{for us to}} see, saying [...] "A gentleman wanted me to tie up some Coachman {{for him to take}} to the north woods and to make them extra strong, so I have tied them with a little band of silk in the middle to prevent the peacock bodies from fraying out. I have also added a tail of the barred feathers of the wood-duck, and I think it makes a very handsome fly." [...] A few evenings later, a circle of us were together [...] "disputing the fly in question", one of the party claiming that numbers were [...] "quite as suitable to designate the flies as so many nonsensical names". The others did not agree with him, but he said: [...] "What can you <b>do?</b> <b>Here</b> is a fly intended to be a Coachman; {{but it is not the}} true Coachman; it is quite unlike it and what can you call it?" [...] Mr. L. C. Orvis, brother of Mr. Charles Orvis, who was present said: [...] "Oh that is easy enough; call it the Royal Coachman it is so finely dressed!" [...] And this name in time came to be known and used by all who are familiar with the fly.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune {{awarded the}} film {{three and a}} half stars, finding that the film [...] "makes up" [...] for the 1998 version and praised Edwards, stating, [...] "The {{director}} thinks visually, which sounds redundant until you realize how many monster movies are flat, effects-dependent factory jobs. Edwards knows how to use great heights for great effect." [...] Phillips also praised the film's build-up, stating, [...] "director Gareth Edwards lays the expository groundwork nicely and hands the audience what it craves in the second half" [...] and defended the amount of screen-time Godzilla received, stating, [...] "Is there enough Godzilla in Godzilla? Folks, there is. There is just enough." [...] David Blaustein of ABC News Radio called the film [...] "very good, but not great", criticizing the film for not having enough screen-time for Godzilla, stating, [...] "There’s not enough Godzilla. When the monster’s away, the movie drags. It’s clear what Edwards and company are trying to <b>do</b> <b>here.</b> i.e. less is more. The issue is, this Godzilla is so much fun to watch, we never want it leave the screen and when he/she/it's not there, it's a letdown." [...] Regardless, Blaustein stated that the film's finale, [...] "more or less, makes it all worth the wait", and awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of five.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his show}} on May 24, 2011, Schultz called Laura Ingraham both a [...] "right-wing slut" [...] and a [...] "talk slut." [...] Feminist {{organizations}} including the Women's Media Center called for his suspension. The following day he issued an apology {{by saying he}} [...] "used vile and inappropriate language when talking about talk show host Laura Ingraham. I am deeply sorry, and I apologize. It was wrong, uncalled for and I recognize the severity of what I said. I apologize to you, Laura, and ask for your forgiveness." [...] He offered an indefinite self-suspension without pay. Ingraham accepted his apology: [...] "Ed Schultz said something about me on his show that was not all that nice, to say the least. It was pretty crude. He apologized, and I accept his apology. It seemed heartfelt, {{it seemed like he}} really wished he hadn't said it and I accept that apology." [...] MSNBC issued a statement saying that it had accepted Schultz's offer to take one week of unpaid leave over the matter. Schultz ended his radio show on May 23, 2014. He stated on MSNBC, [...] "This change will give me more flexibility to be on the road, to do the kind of shows I want to <b>do</b> <b>here</b> for The Ed Show here on MSNBC. This is on me, you know. I just don't want to do a three-hour talk show anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another factor {{connected}} {{with these two}} schools demands separate attention, [...] {{because it is a}} consequence of segregation so outlandish that the Attorney General, with commendable candor, has in effect refused to defend it. I refer to the fact that school bus transportation is provided those attending No. 29 who, except for color, are in the same situation as this infant plaintiff. Yet neither school bus transportation, nor its equivalent is provided this plaintiff even to attend No. 107. In fact, the State Board of Education refused to authorize the transportation of this then seven-year-old plaintiff to the Negro school, even though the bus for white children went right past her home, and even though the two schools are no more than a mile apart. Moreover, there is no public transportation available from or near plaintiff's home to or near the Negro school. The State Board ruled that because of the State constitutional provision for separate schools, a Negro child may not ride in a bus serving a white school. If we assume that this is so, then this practice in and of itself, is another reason why the facilities offered this plaintiff at No. 107 are inferior to those provided at No. 29. To suggest, under the facts here presented, that there are not enough Negroes to warrant the cost of a school bus for them is only another way of saying that they are not entitled to equal services because they are Negroes. Such an excuse will not <b>do</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
