40|$|Nanoparticle {{reinforcement}} {{of the matrix}} in laminates has been recently explored to improve mechanical properties, particularly the interlaminar strength. This study analyses the fatigue behaviour of nanoclay and multiwalled carbon nanotubes enhanced glass/epoxy laminates. The matrix used was the epoxy resin Biresin CR 120, combined with the hardener CH 120 - 3. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) 98 % and organo-montmorillonite Nanomer I 30 E nanoclay were used. Composites plates were manufactured by moulding in vacuum. Fatigue tests were performed under constant amplitude, both under tension–tension and three points bending loadings. The fatigue results show that composites with small amounts of nanoparticles addition into the matrix have bending fatigue strength similar to the obtained for the neat glass fibre reinforced epoxy matrix composite. On the contrary, for higher percentages of nanoclays or carbon nanotubes addition the fatigue strength tend to decrease caused by poor nanoparticles dispersion and formation of agglomerates. Tensile fatigue strength is only marginally affected {{by the addition of}} small amount of particles. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>ratio</b> in tensio –tension loading increases with the addition of nanoclays and multi-walled carbon nanotubes, suggesting that both nanoparticles can act as barriers to fatigue crack propagation...|$|E

Single motor units were functionally isolated by microdissection of the ventral root, and the glycogen depletion technique was used to demonstrate the muscle fibers in the unit. Morphological and immuno- and enzyme-histochemical methods were applied to serial muscle cross sections to characterize the muscle fibers in the unit. Three of the units had muscle fibers of the IIa type according to staining both for myofibrillar adenosinetriphosphatase after acid preincubation and {{with the use of}} monoclonal antibodies specific for myosin heavy chains (MHCs), i. e., the IIa-MHC isoform. The other 18 units were of the IIb type according to enzyme-histochemistry, but immunohistochemistry showed that in six of these units the muscle fibers exhibited the novel type IIx-MHC isoform and in the other 12 units the IIb-MHC isoform.

40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} {{focuses on}} high cycle fretting fatigue crack nucleation prediction. A plastic steel/steel cylinder/plane contact was investigated keeping constant the normal force and the maximum <b>fatigue</b> stress <b>ratio</b> but varying the <b>fatigue</b> stress <b>ratio</b> (RF= 0. 6 to 1). The evolution of the crack length as function of the applied fretting tangential force amplitude at 10 ^ 6 cycles allows us to formalize the crack nucleation condition.

To model the experiments, a 2 D plastic plain strain FEM modeling is performed. As expected the computed stress field description is mesh dependent. However we demonstrate that a representative stress description is obtained at the 3 rd node (i. e. 2 nd node below the surface). By coupling this mesh condition and non-local critical distance approach, reliable prediction of the crack nucleation risk can be achieved either considering a Crossland multi-axial fatigue analysis or using a basic uni-axial Haighs description...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the fatigue limit of lamellar pearlitic steel used for railroad rails, tensile tests and fatigue tests are performed. Although the <b>fatigue</b> <b>ratio</b> of the lamellar pearlitic steel is {{lower than that of}} general steels, the reason for this has not been clarified. The fatigue cracks of the pearlitic steel initiate at a very early stage during the fatigue test. It is speculated that the steel should be treated as a steel with initial defects. In order to determine the initial defect size of the ultra-low cycle fatigue test, tensile tests are performed. Based on the test results, it was clarified that the crack initiation size depends on the crystal structure. In order to predict the fatigue limit of the pearlitic steel, Murakami's prediction method is applied to the steel. The measured defect sizes are applied to the method, and the fatigue tests are performed. The predicted fatigue limits and the test results have good agreement. In addition, from the SEM observations, the initial crack causing the fatigue failure was found to be a pearlite block. We then concluded that the fatigue limit of the pearlitic steel can be predicted by Murakami's method and the defect size is the pearlite block size. If the pearlite block sizes then become small, the fatigue limit of the pearlitic steel will increase...|$|E
40|$|Microstructural {{features}} {{within a}} material dictate the material’s mechanical behavior {{and lead to}} localized strains as the sample is deformed. In order to further understand structural failure, an improved understanding of how microstructural features influence failure is necessary. Fatigue is one common mode of failure for aerospace applications, and {{a better understanding of}} the conditions of crack initiation can provide information that ultimately may increase longevity of aerospace systems. This paper investigates the hypothesis that fatigue crack initiation for a cyclically loaded sample is correlated to areas of higher localized strain. The experiment was conducted using a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V sample subjected to low amplitude <b>fatigue</b> <b>ratio.</b> For sample preparation, a titanium nanopowder solution is applied to an area of interest. The titanium particles on the sample are then imaged in an optical microscope, and the displacement of each particle is measured after loading the sample. The resultant displacement field is converted into a strain field, which will indicate locations on the sample with higher localized strains. When comparing sites of crack initiation to the strain field map, there is a tendency for cracks to initiate near locations with high localized strains. This knowledge can lead to an improved ability to predict fatigue crack initiation locations, and can also be used to improve structural designs at the microstructural level...|$|E

In this study we have tried to assess the weakness (muscle strength) and fatigue (endurance) of these patients with an objective measurement method, isokinetic muscle testing. Methods: Twenty three TOS patients and 15 age matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Detailed histories of the patients were taken and the patients underwent complete physical examinations. Cervical radiographies, Doppler ultrasonography, electromyography, and isokinetic measurements were carried out. The isokinetic measurements were carried using the Biodex System 3 dynamometer during concentric shoulder flexions and extensions at velocities of 60 /̊s, 180 /̊s, and 240 /̊s.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine whether standing while pedaling increased any variables measured by a 30 second anaerobic Wingate test. METHODS: Nine male, physically active subjects completed 2 - 30 second Wingate tests. One test was a standard test in which the subject had to remain seated during the entire test. The other test required the subject to stand up and pedal 5 seconds after the load was applied to the wheel for the remaining of the protocol. RESULTS: Averages for seated cycling were 650. 6 W ± 48. 8 for mean power, 1010. 9 W ± 88. 21 for peak power, 20. 13 W/s ± 3. 82 for <b>fatigue</b> <b>ratio,</b> and 173 ± 9. 49 mean rpm’s.

The purpose of this report is to test the application of Vera solder for use with the base metals of Verabond II and Minalux {{and its effect on}} fatigue behavior of these joints. Fifteen cast and 12 soldered joint specimens were made of each alloy. The thermal cycles required for oxidation, opaque, dentin and glazing were performed. Rotating, bending and cantilever fatigue tests were performed with a 2880 rpm (ASTM Rotating bending fatigue testing of metals JIsz 22 74; 1078). All soldered specimens except two in each group fractured at soldered joints. All of the specimens from intact Verabond II and Minalux fractured at the gripping point of machine except two Minalux specimens that fractured at the midpoint. Under equal load, the number of loading cycles to cause fracture in intact Verabond II is greater than in intact Minalux. In soldered Verabond II the fatigue limit was 20 MPa higher than in soldered Minalux.

While in the past its use was mainly driven by consumer goods and electronic applications by Asian manufacturers such as notebook computer cases, digital camera bodies, chain saw housings, etc., currently Thixomolding® has been widely extended to other applications. Some examples are in automotive and sports equipment, such as automotive shift cams, bicycle saddles, fishing reels, snowboard bindings, etc. Wider applications of Thixomolding® magnesium alloys mainly depend on various advantages such as a simple and completely automatic manufacturing process, high productivity, and repeatability of the mechanical properties of parts. Moreover, due to low molding temperatures and laminar flow of the semisolid injected material, longer die life and dimensional precision are expected. In addition, complex geometry and net shape forming are possible, thus avoiding any further machining.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new algorithm known as Wavelet Bump Extraction (WBE) for summarising long records of fatigue data by extracting the important features {{that cause the}} majority of the damage. One of the main elements in WBE is the orthogonal wavelet transform. In WBE the input signal is decomposed using Daubechies wavelets and the wavelet levels are grouped into characteristic frequency bands. Features, called bumps, are extracted from each wavelet group and they are later synchronised together to produce a bump signal. The accuracy of the WBE algorithm has been evaluated by application to two experimentally measured data sets. One data set had a predominantly tensile mean load and the length of the extracted bumps was 41 % of the signal. The <b>fatigue</b> damage <b>ratio</b> between the original and reduced time histories was 96 % and 99 % as calculated using the nSoft® package with the Smith-Watson-Topper and Morrow strain-life models, respectively.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{compared}} {{the reliability and}} fracture patterns of zirconia cores veneered with pressable porcelain submitted to either axial or off-axis sliding contact fatigue. Methods: Forty-two Y-TZP plates (12 mm x 12 mm x 0. 5 mm) veneered with pressable porcelain (12 mm x 12 mm x 1. 2 mm) and adhesively luted to water aged composite resin blocks (12 mm x 12 mm x 4 mm) were stored in water at least 7 days prior to testing. Profiles for step-stress <b>fatigue</b> (<b>ratio</b> 3 : 2 : 1) were determined from single load to fracture tests (n = 3). Fatigue loading was delivered on specimen either on axial (n = 18) or off-axis 30 degrees angulation (n = 18) to simulate posterior tooth cusp inclination creating a 0. 7 mm slide. Single load and fatigue tests utilized a 6. 25 mm diameter WC indenter. Specimens were inspected by means of polarized-light microscope and SEM. Use level probability Weibull curves were plotted with 2 -sided 90 % confidence bounds (CB) and reliability for missions of 50, 000 cycles at 200 N (90 % CB) were calculated. Results: The calculated Weibull Beta was 3. 34 and 2. 47 for axial and off-axis groups, respectively, indicating that fatigue accelerated failure in both loading modes. The reliability data for a mission of 50, 000 cycles at 200 N load with 90 % CB indicates no difference between loading groups. Deep penetrating cone cracks reaching the core-veneer interface were observed in both groups. Partial cones due to the sliding component were observed along with the cone cracking for the off-axis group. No Y-TZP core fractures were observed. Conclusions: Reliability was not significantly different between axial and off-axis mouth-motion fatigued pressed over Y-TZP cores, but incorporation of sliding resulted in more aggressive damage on the veneer.

BackgroundDyspnea is a frequent limiting symptom in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). This sensation may originate from activation of receptors in the musculature rather than the lung. MethodsTo investigate whether dyspnea could be alleviated by selective changes in leg muscle function, we performed isolated lower-limb training in 17 patients with severe CHF. Eight patients learned guided imagery relaxation techniques and served as an active control group. Exercise training consisted of three months of low-level bicycle and treadmill exercise such that minute ventilation was < 25 l/min. Leg calisthenics were also performed. Maximal and submaximal exercise performance, respiratory and quadriceps muscle strength and endurance and quality-of-life and dyspnea scales were measured before and after each intervention. Metabolic stress testing (VO 2), pulmonary function tests and isokinetic strength testing were also performed. ResultsIn the active control group, no changes in leg muscle function, pulmonary function, maximal and submaximal exercise performance or quality-of-life questionnaires were observed. In the training group, peak torque of leg flexors (pre: 39 ± 15 ft-lb; post: 50 ± 13 ft-lb; p < 0. 002) increased and the <b>fatigue</b> <b>ratio</b> decreased, indicating improved strength and endurance of the leg muscles. Maximal inspiratory and expiratory mouth pressures and maximum voluntary ventilation were unchanged. Peak VO 2 was increased (pre: 12 ± 2. 2 ml/kg/min; post: 14 ± 2. 6 ml/kg/min) as well as the duration of exercise at 70 % peak VO 2 increased (pre: 11. 5 ± 3. 1 min; post: 21. 5 ± 5. 4 min; p < 0. 003). Perceived dyspnea during the submaximal testing was decreased.

Methods A total of 40 male swimmers were assessed and randomly divided in two groups: experimental group (n= 20; age: 14. 65 ± 0. 67 years old, height: 173. 48 ± 6. 87 cm, body mass: 63. 15 ± 5. 68 kg) and control group (n= 20; age: 14. 60 ± 0. 60 years old, height: 170. 79 ± 6. 48 cm, body mass: 61. 73 ± 4. 68 kg). Experimental subjects participated in a 16 week shoulder strength program with Thera-Band® elastic bands (3 times a week). The external rotator (ER) /internal rotators (IR) ratio and <b>fatigue</b> <b>ratio</b> were measured in both groups at baseline and after 16 weeks. Concentric action at 60 º/s (3 reps) and 180 º/s (20 reps) were measured, in a seated position, with the shoulder at 90 º of abduction and elbow flexion, using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3). The muscular fatigue protocol consisted in 20 maximal-effort repetitions of ER and IR at 180 º/s. Anova with repeated measures was used to determine significant main effects in unilateral ER/IR ratios and fatigue ratios. The level of significance was set at 0. 05. Results Considering ER/IR ratio, a compensatory strength training programme induces significant differences in both shoulders at 60 º/s (Dominant: P= 0. 001; Non dominant: P= 0. 001). At 180 º/s we just found significant effects on the Dominant shoulder ER/IR ratio (P= 0. 002). With respect to fatigue ratios, we found no differences between groups from baseline and 16 weeks. Discussion Our results show that 16 weeks of compensatory strength training improve ER/IR ratio, nevertheless, were not enough to improve fatigue ratios, representing the rotators shoulder muscular resistance. This results support earlier research (Malliou et al., 2004) that showed that the unilateral shoulder strength ratios increases substantially after a period of a strength training program. Since the ratios describe the quality of muscular balance/imbalance (Ellenbecker & Davies, 2004), we can conclude that a 16 week compensatory shoulder strength training program using Thera-Band® elastic bands, reduces muscular imbalances in rotator cuff of competitive young swimmers. These results highlight the useful of this kind of compensatory program to prevent shoulder injuries. References 1. 	Malliou, P. C. Giannakopoulos, K. Beneka, A. G. Gioftsidou, A. and Godolias, G.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether or not adding a Wingate sprint to a circuit weight training session would optimize the acute HGH response to exercise. Methods. Seven recreational resistance-trained male subjects (n= 8) performed 4 exercise trials in a balanced order: 1) a Wingate sprint only(W), 2) a circuit weight training session (C), 3) a Wingate sprint prior to circuit weight training session (WC), 4) a Wingate sprint following circuit weight training session (CW). Blood samples were collected at rest prior to each exercise trial, and at 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min post cool-down for all trials. The Wingate sprint was against a resistance of 7 % of the subjects’ body mass (0. 7 Nm/kg) on a cycle ergometer. The circuit weight training session was a full body workout (40 %- 50 % 1 RM for circuit 1 and 70 % 1 RM for circuit 2 and 3) consisting of 6 exercises in the following exercise order – bench press, bent-over barbell row, smith machine squat, seated dumbbell shoulder press without back support, Romanian deadlift, and latissiumus dorsi pull-down. HGH was measured at the respective time for blood collections. Blood lactate concentration and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured immediately after exercise and prior to cool-down in each trial. Results. Both the WC and CW trials resulted in significant increases in serum HGH concentrations up to 30 min post cool-down. The C trial resulted in a significant increase in serum HGH concentration up to 20 min post cool-down. No significant increase in serum HGH concentration post cool-down was found after the W trial. The CW trial resulted in: 1) significantly higher blood lactate concentration and RPE compared to other trials (p<. 05), 2) a significantly higher serum HGH concentration compared to the W and the C trials at 20 min post cool-down (p<. 05), 3) a significantly higher HGH concentration compared to the C and the WC trials at 30 min post cool-down (p<. 05), 4) a significantly higher HGH AUC compared to the C and the W trials (p<. 05), 5) a significant higher peak HGH concentration compared to the C trial (p<. 05).

J. 3, 4 1 :University of Évora, Portugal, 2 :Health Science and Technology Research Centre, 3 :University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal, 4 :Research Centre of Sports, Health and Human Development. Introduction The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} de effects of 16 week compensatory strength training program in shoulder rotators balance and muscular fatigue in young swimmers. Methods A total of 40 male swimmers were assessed and randomly divided in two groups: experimental group (n= 20; age: 14. 65 ± 0. 67 years old, height: 173. 48 ± 6. 87 cm, body mass: 63. 15 ± 5. 68 kg) and control group (n= 20; age: 14. 60 ± 0. 60 years old, height: 170. 79 ± 6. 48 cm, body mass: 61. 73 ± 4. 68 kg). Experimental subjects participated in a 16 week shoulder strength program with Thera-Band® elastic bands (3 times a week). The external rotator (ER) /internal rotators (IR) ratio and <b>fatigue</b> <b>ratio</b> were measured in both groups at baseline and after 16 weeks. Concentric action at 60 º/s (3 reps) and 180 º/s (20 reps) were measured, in a seated position, with the shoulder at 90 º of abduction and elbow flexion, using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3). The muscular fatigue protocol consisted in 20 maximal-effort repetitions of ER and IR at 180 º/s. Anova with repeated measures was used to determine significant main effects in unilateral ER/IR ratios and fatigue ratios. The level of significance was set at 0. 05. Results Considering ER/IR ratio, a compensatory strength training programme induces significant differences in both shoulders at 60 º/s (Dominant: P= 0. 001; Non dominant: P= 0. 001). At 180 º/s we just found significant effects on the Dominant shoulder ER/IR ratio (P= 0. 002). With respect to fatigue ratios, we found no differences between groups from baseline and 16 weeks. Discussion Our results show that 16 weeks of compensatory strength training improve ER/IR ratio, nevertheless, were not enough to improve fatigue ratios, representing the rotators shoulder muscular resistance. This results support earlier research (Malliou et al., 2004) that showed that the unilateral shoulder strength ratios increases substantially after a period of a strength training program. Since the ratios describe the quality of muscular balance/imbalance (Ellenbecker & Davies, 2004), we can conclude that a 16 week compensatory shoulder strength training program using Thera-Band® elastic bands, reduces muscular imbalances in rotator cuff of competitive young swimmers. These results highlight the useful of this kind of compensatory program to prevent shoulder injuries. References 1. 	Malliou, P. C. Giannakopoulos, K. Beneka, A. G. Gioftsidou, A. and Godolias, G.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of corrosion fatigue cracks observed on the un-notched round specimen surface differs with specimen diameter, {{especially in the}} low stress amplitude region. At a constant <b>fatigue</b> life <b>ratio,</b> many long cracks are initiated on the larger specimen, 12 mm (diameter), {{in comparison with the}} smaller specimen, 6 mm (diameter). On the other hand, in the high stress amplitude region of corrosion fatigue and fatigue in laboratory air, the {{distribution of}} cracks during the fatigue process does not depend on specimen diameters. In the low stress amplitude region of corrosion fatigue, crack growth rate does not show the usual behavior of the dependence of crack length, but shows only the dependence of stress amplitude. This unusual crack growth behavior explains why the distribution of corrosion fatigue cracks in the low stress amplitude region changes with specimen diameters...|$|R

The cost, once very expensive, has been reduced, making titanium even more of a competitive material today. Titanium and titanium alloys have a great affinity to several elements.

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via: [URL] β-titanium alloys such as Ti 15 V 3 Al 3 Cr 3 Sn are of great technological interest thanks to their high <b>fatigue</b> strength-to-density <b>ratio.</b> However, their high hardness and poor machinability increase machining costs. Additionally, formation of undesirable long chips increases the machining time. To address those issues, a metastable β-titanium alloy (Ti 15 V 3 Al 3 Cr 2 Zr 0. 9 La) with enhanced machinability was developed to produce short chips even at low cutting speeds. A hybrid ultrasonically assisted machining technique, known to reduce cutting forces, was employed in this study. Cutting force components and surface quality of the finished work-pieces were analyzed {{for a range of}} cutting speeds in comparison with those for more traditional Ti 15 V 3 Al 3 Cr 3 Sn. The novel alloy demonstrated slightly improved machining characteristics at higher cutting speeds and is now ready for industrial applications...|$|R

Critical illness {{is associated with}} muscle weakness leading to long-term functional limitations. Objectives. To assess the reliability of a novel method for evaluating fatigability of the quadriceps muscle in noncooperating healthy subjects. Methods. On two occasions, separated by seven days, nonvoluntary isometric contractions (twitch and tetanic) of the quadriceps femoris muscle evoked by transcutaneous electrical muscle stimulation were recorded in twelve healthy adults. For tetanic contractions, the <b>Fatigue</b> Index (<b>ratio</b> of peak torque values) and {{the slope of the}} regression line of peak torque values were primary outcome measures. For twitch contractions, maximum peak torque and rise time were calculated.

40|$|Fatigue {{properties}} of polycrystalline copper films subjected to pulsating stresses are investigated {{on the basis}} of observations of surface topography, fracture surface and dislocation structure. Fatigue limit corresponding to 10 ^ 7 cycles of a rolled copper film is 2. 3 times higher than that of an annealed one, but the <b>fatigue</b> limit <b>ratio</b> of the rolled specimen is lower than that of annealed one. From the observations of the surface crack and fracture surface, it is found that fatigue crack initiation and early-stage crack growth mechanisms of annealed bulk copper are not necessarily applicable to those of film. No striations are formed in both films. In annealed films, cell structures are formed under high-cycle fatigue whereas no band/ladder structures are formed. Dislocation structures near the fatigue crack in annealed films {{are similar to those of}} bulk specimens except for the absence of intensely elongated cells observed in the shear flow regions in the bulk specimen. No appreciable change during fatigue was found in the dislocation structures of rolled films...|$|R
40|$|PurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{reliability}} and the learning effect of an isokinetic trunk flexion–extension protocol designed to simultaneously assess trunk muscle strength and endurance. In addition, the effect of the participants' sex on the reliability data was examined. MethodsFifty-seven healthy and physically active young men (n[*]=[*] 28) and women (n[*]=[*] 29) performed the isokinetic protocol 5 times, separated by a week between each of the first 4 sessions and by a month between the last 2 sessions. The protocol consisted of performing 4 trials of 15 maximum flexion–extension concentric exertions at 120 °/s (range of trunk motion[*]=[*] 50 °). The absolute and relative peak torque and total work were calculated to assess trunk flexion and extension strength. In addition, endurance ratio, modified endurance <b>ratio,</b> <b>fatigue</b> final <b>ratio,</b> recovery ratio, and modified recovery ratio variables were used for the assessment of trunk muscle endurance in both directions. ResultsRegarding the absolute reliability, no relevant changes were found between paired-comparison sessions for most strength and endurance variables, except for total work and relative total work variables in the flexion movement in both sexes. In addition, the typical error of the isokinetic variables was lower than 10 % in both males and females, and minimum detectable changes ranged from 7 %– 20 %, with a tendency to be higher in females and in endurance variables. The strength variables showed high intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC; > 0. 74); however, for the endurance variables only the endurance ratio and the modified endurance ratio obtained moderate to high ICC values (0. 57 < ICC < 0. 82). In addition, the analysis of the variance reported no significant differences between consecutive pairs of sessions for most variables in both sexes. ConclusionOverall, these findings provide clinicians, trainers, and researchers with a 10 -min single-session protocol to perform a reliable muscle strength and endurance evaluation of trunk flexor and extensor muscles, all within the same protocol...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} safely use {{precipitation}} strengthening type A 286 stainless steel in high cycles, the fundamental fatigue strength characteristics were investigated using fatigue tests at room temperature. During the fatigue test, the author {{paid attention to}} the behaviour of small fatigue cracks in order to clarify the fatigue strength properties in more detail than the usual fatigue test. As a result of the fatigue test, the fatigue strength characteristic of the A 286 steel became clarified as shown below. The <b>fatigue</b> strength <b>ratio</b> of the A 286 steel is lower than 0. 5 which is the ratio value of most steels. The cracks propagate which result in a failure even after 107 cycles. It was found that there are two crack mechanisms propagation of the A 286 steel; i. e., in a high load-stress, the cracks monotonously propagate and result in failure. Under a low load-stress, the cracks intermittently propagate even after 107 cycles. The non-propagating cracks coalesce with a new crack which initiates near the crack tip and it becomes longer, finally resulting in a failure. This is the reason why the fatigue failures occur even after 107 cycles...|$|R

This PhD project {{was sponsored by}} a group in Rolls-Royce plc concerned with fractog- raphy and failure investigation, {{with the purpose of}} asking whether dwell, high cycle and low cycle <b>fatigue,</b> stress <b>ratio</b> or block loading can be distinguished from fracture sur- faces. Therefore, the central theme of this thesis is the examination of fracture surfaces of a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy and relating them to the fatigue loading regimes. The as-received material was unidirectional rolled and exhibited a nearly equiaxed microstructure with a strong 11 ̄ 20 ⟨ 0001 ⟩ texture. A series of LCF and dwell experiments were performed on unnotched cylindrical samples to investigate initiation behaviour under both loading con- ditions. The formation of fatigue striations was investigated with corner crack specimens. The fatigue initiation behaviour was substantially different between continuously cy- cled samples and specimens that experienced long dwell periods at high stress.
