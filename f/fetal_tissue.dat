5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the uses}} of these cell lines is to provide an {{environment}} for virus replication. The Oka/Merck strain of live attenuated varicella virus {{is one of the}} viruses that require this environment to grow. Some controversy has arisen due to the ideas that the vaccine contains components of or has required the use of an aborted fetus, which violates the ethics and beliefs of many who oppose the use of aborted fetuses in medical research. While the cell line provides the environment in which the virus is grown and subsequently isolated from, theoretically, the vaccine itself is free from extraneous biological agents. Nevertheless, Merck & Co., Inc.'s M-M-R®II, ZOSTAVAX® and VARIVAX® vaccine descriptions state that [...] "residual components of MRC-5 cells including DNA and protein" [...] are present in the vaccine. Also, the use of the WI-38 and MRC-5 cell lines for growing the varicella virus is controversial because these human embryonic lung cells were derived from aborted fetuses. Due to beliefs concerning the use of human embryonic <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> in medical research, some individuals are opposed to using the varicella vaccine.|$|E
