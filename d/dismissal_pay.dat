40|$|Existing studies either {{overlook}} {{the importance of}} the juridical enforcement of employment protection legislation in determining the labor market consequences of dismissal payments or else neglect the possibly judicial biases caused by a tight labor market due to the assumption of exogenous judicial errors. By calling for endogenously determined judicial errors, this paper not only traces the effect of a firing litigation on employment, but also explores the possible effects of labor market conditions on judicial mistakes. We show that worse labor market conditions (a larger <b>dismissal</b> <b>pay)</b> will induce judges to be more favorable toward fired workers (firms). Thus, a higher level of unemployment (a larger <b>dismissal</b> <b>pay)</b> will decrease (increase) the possibility of a type- 1 error and increase (decrease) the possibility of a type- 2 error. It is also shown that, while a policy that lowers a type- 1 error will increase the employment level, a lower type- 2 error, somewhat surprisingly, will not necessarily {{have a positive effect on}} employment. Besides, in departing from the findings of previous analyses, we find that <b>dismissal</b> <b>pay</b> can either increase or decrease the employment level, with this crucially depending on the probability of juridical mistakes.

40|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} the private and social gains of shareholder activism in an optimal contracting framework involving dispersed shareholders who may become active. The social gains {{are based on the}} welfare to stake holders in the firm, whereas the private gains are based on shareholder wealth only. Active shareholders influence the contracting game with the CEO, and therefore also the size and the distribution of the surplus to be split between the shareholders and the CEO. Although the model is very simple and focussing on the creation and distribution of welfare between the shareholders and the CEO, we nonetheless identify surprising divergence between the private and social profitability of shareholder activism. Shareholder activism that is privately profitable is not necessarily socially profitable. The distributional effects of shareholder activism may dominate the efficiency effects to make shareholder activism a negative social NPV project.

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a model of {{individual}} dismissals based on the workers' right to file a suit against their employer arguing that the dismissal is unjustified or unfair. The model is a standard pre-trial bargaining game between a firm and a worker. We study two cases: when the law states the severance <b>pay</b> for unfair <b>dismissal</b> (the European case), and when judges can decide freely on the compensation {{to be paid to}} the worker (the American case). The model provides some guidelines for Labour Law reforms. In the European case, a decrease in the severance <b>pay</b> for unfair <b>dismissals</b> fixed by law will decrease the severance pay offered by the firm, and only under some assumptions will decrease the expected firing cost and will increase the settlement probability. In addition, the transition from the European to the American case is likely to increase the probability of settlement (and to decrease it in the opposite case) with ambiguous effects on agreed severance pay and expected firing costs. dismissal, individual <b>dismissal,</b> severance <b>pay,</b> firing costs, Labour Law...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} comparative and interdisciplinary legal and economic study on managing labour redundancies in seven EU member countries. It is structured for comparability between the systems examined. The introductory section contains {{an account of the}} evolution of the Dutch labour market, with special reference to redundancy trends, of the features of the programmes for managing redundancies, of the roles of firms and the ‘external environment’ in handling workforce adjustments. The second section presents a map of policies that work to prevent labour redundancies (preventive measures) such as flexibility, training etc. Next, the instruments for handling temporary labour redundancies (retentive measures) are examined (e. g. short-time working, temporary layoffs etc.). The following section is devoted to instruments and programmes involved in the management of permanent labour redundancies (expulsive measures), e. g. collective <b>dismissals,</b> severance <b>pay</b> etc. The final section provides an overall assessment of the Dutch system for managing labour redundancies, and briefly discusses the national debate on the prospects for reform, in light of the principles and policies of convergence set forth by the European Union...|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{relevant}} {{for the design of}} optimal compensation policy in the face of workers’ self-control problems (see Gilpatric 2008; Kaur et al. 2010; 2011; Jain 2012). First is the degree of workers’ present-bias; the greater the present-bias, the sharper is the required trade-off between compensation and effort, and the more costly it is for firms to motivate workers. Second {{is the extent to which}} firms are allowed to punish workers who shirk, e.g., through <b>dismissal</b> or withholding <b>pay.</b> Third is the extent to which workers either understand (i.e., are sophisticated) or do not understand (i.e., are naïve) that they have self-control issues. Sophisticated workers’ may prefer more limited choice sets – for example, compensation schedules with commitment devices, e.g., quotas, which assist in maintaining self-control. 14 Fourth is the extent to which contracting occurs over multiple periods. The final factor is the distribution of time-consistent versus present-biased preferences; workers who do not have self-control issues may receive rents if firms attempt to motivate those who do.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} to what extent the existence of high labor adjustment costs has some influence on the process of wage negotiation. In particular, it aims to analyse if the risk of being laid off has any impact on insiders' bargaining power and, consequently, on their wage claims. Design/methodology/approach – A collective bargaining model that closely follows those developed by Nickell et al. and Bentolila and Dolado is adopted and a longitudinal panel of large Portuguese firms from all sectors over the 1993 - 199 period is used. Findings – The results reveal that firms where insider workers appear to have more bargaining power tend to pay higher wages. In particular, we found that the threat of dismissal tends to weaken insiders' bargaining power and, consequently, to depress wages. Research limitations/implications – In future research an attempt should be made to measure directly the labor turnover costs. Originality/value – This paper presents robust empirical evidence using micro-data for individual firms that support one of the predictions of the insider-outsider theory that wages will be higher in sectors (firms) with high labor turnover costs. <b>Dismissal,</b> Market forces, <b>Pay</b> bargaining, Portugal, Rents...|$|R
5000|$|Full-Time status varies between {{company and}} is often based on the shift the {{employee}} must work during each work week. The [...] "standard" [...] work week consists of five eight-hour days, commonly served between 9:00AM to 5:00PM or 10:00AM to 6:00pm totaling 40 hours. While a four-day week generally consists of four ten-hour days; it may also consist of as little as nine hours {{for a total of}} a 36-hour work week. Twelve-hour shifts are often three days per week, unless the company has the intention of paying out the employee overtime. Overtime is legally paid out anytime an employee works more than 40 hours per week. The legal minimum for overtime starts at Base Pay + One-Half. The increased payout is considered to compensate slightly for the increased fatigue which a person experiences on such long shifts. Shifts can also be very irregular, as in retail, but are still full-time if the required number of hours is reached. There are some situations where a person who needs full-time work is dropped to part-time, which is sometimes a form of constructive <b>dismissal</b> to avoid <b>paying</b> unemployment benefits to a laid-off worker.|$|R
30|$|The {{underlying}} {{theory for}} our analysis is the dynamic labor demand theory. While the static labor demand theory focuses on firms’ optimal employment level, the dynamic counterpart analyzes firms’ adjustment toward the optimum {{and the time}} it takes to reach the optimal employment level which is not possible within the static theory (see Cahuc and Zylberberg, 2004, p.  212). Adjustment costs are an essential component of dynamic labor demand theory because they play an important role in firms’ adjustment behavior. These costs are the reason that a plant does not dismiss all employees before the weekend and re-hire them on Monday (see Franz, 2013, p.  146; Nickell, 1986, p.  473). Labor is not a completely variable production factor because adjustment costs form a fixed component of total labor costs. Therefore Oi (1962) calls labor a ‘quasi-fix’ factor. Adjustment costs arise from an employment change and consist of hiring costs (e.g., search, selection, first training, administrative expenses of the Human Resources Department) and costs of <b>dismissals</b> (e.g., severance <b>pay,</b> consideration of <b>dismissal</b> protection, administrative expenses of the Human Resources Department). Ehrenberg and Smith (2012, p.  145) consider hiring costs as investments and so they point out the ‘sunk’ character of these costs.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} strict {{employment}} protection legislation (EPL) on unemployment is still uncertain. However, evidence in literature {{points to the}} hiring and firing provisions of EPL being the source {{of some of the}} labour market rigidity in South Africa. Hiring and firing provisions comprise a number of elements such as severance <b>pay,</b> <b>dismissal</b> procedures, probationary employment and temporary work arrangements. This research investigates the impact of these measures on the hiring and firing decision through a survey questionnaire distributed to approximately 20 000 small business respondents, who were also tested on the impact of EPL on small business in creating new jobs. The purpose of the research was therefore to contribute to the literature on the role which EPL plays in the hiring and firing decision, and ultimately on unemployment. The results of the research point to a still strong perception that EPL in South Africa is strict despite evidence to the contrary, and that small business respondents believe procedural elements {{play a significant role in}} their hiring and firing decision, but some uncertainty with regard to the role of severance pay. The strongest indication was the perception of the regulatory burden of EPL faced by small businesses. Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityLatin America is {{currently}} undergoing a tremendous {{change in the}} basic pattern of economic development. New investment in heavy industry and increased population are resulting in greater per capita and total consumption. The effect of this changing trend upon one of this area's oldest and most important consumer good industries, the textile industry, {{has been the subject}} of one aspect of this paper. The scope of the study has been restricted to the two largest countries in size of population and size of their textile industries. The choice of Brazil and Mexico was determined by similarities in their history of textile industry development, the aggregate size of their populations in relation to Latin America as an entity and the comprehensive volume of labor legislation which each has enacted. The study was undertaken to determine if the superimposing of an advanced code of labor legislation upon the early stages of textile industry development has had a deterrent effect on the growth of the industry. Since population growth has been rapid in both Brazil and Mexico, in recent years, and per capita income has been rising, it would be reasonable to expect the textile segment of the economy to be expanding and modernizing to meet the needs of these growing economies. In evolving this study to determine if the textile industry has in actuality progressed at a pace comparable to that of the balance of the economy and to view the effects of labor unionism, labor legislation and management policies on the development of this industry, the following procedure has been adopted: (1) to briefly review the early growth of the textile industry in Brazil and Mexico, (2) to sketch the background of union development and the early activities leading to labor legislation, (3) to review the body of labor legislation which has developed and show effects of its impact on the economy, and (4) to evaluate the effects of union end management policies on the growth of the textile industry. The first modern textile mills developed in Brazil about 1876 and in Mexico in 1830. There was a rapid growth of mills due to good investment opportunities and new machinery developments. The owners of these mills tended to form paternalistic mill villages, in Brazil. This initial investment was followed by a long period of stagnation due primarily to a limited availability of new capital and a lessened marginal efficiency for further textile machinery investment at that time. The Mexican industry developed rapidly for about fifteen years and then growth stagnated until about 1890 when it enjoyed another spurt of activity. The Mexican mills were primarily foreign owned and operated by Europeans. Labor did not enjoy good treatment in these Mexican mills and it was usually indebted to the mills for food and other necessities secured from mill owned stores. The development of labor unionism in the early years of the twentieth century found interested followers in both Brazil and Nexico. In Brazil, the early unions were primarily mutual benefit societies and continued to be such until about 1928 when a national labor party was founded. The spread of unions espousing communist ideas took place about this time with the result that the government placed restrictions on unions in general and in 1930 prohibited free unions. In contrast to Brazil, Mexican unions were illegal from the outset and it was not until after the revolution in 1910 that they were permitted to organize freely without interference. They were not legal even at this date but the government tolerated them. In 1917, labor, with the tacit approval of the government, was successful in incorporating an advanced body of labor legislation into two articles of the new Constitution. These articles provided the base for a Federal Labor Code in 1931 and a large body of legislation which extended to Mexican labor a program of minimum wages, vacations with <b>pay,</b> <b>dismissal</b> wages, collective bargaining contracts and free unionism. These developed piecemeal into effective instruments in the national economy which have greatly increased security of employment and higher labor costs. A similar development occurred in Brazil with the adoption of the 1937 Constitution and the subsequent consolidation of the Brazilian labor laws in Decree-law No. 5452 of May 1, 1943. These documents assured Brazilian labor of higher wages, dismissal wages, paid holidays, vacations with pay and collective bargaining contracts. However, in Brazil, strikes and lock-outs were declared illegal and the government had to pass on all contracts and union organizations. The result of this legislation has been that the cost of labor to management has risen so that it is no longer feasible to consider increasing the labor factor when increased production and higher quality are required. One of the major problems of the textile unions in both Brazil and Mexico has been the existence of a large supply of excess labor which knows no trade other than textiles. This factor has dominated trade union policy toward management plans for modernizing the textile industry, largely as a result of union opposition to modernization due to a fear of large scale dismissal of labor. A result of this has been that the industry has turned to tariff protection as a means of maintaining a domestic market for their product, regardless of the price or quality of product. The social legislation favoring labor and the tariff protection favoring the mills in each country has developed a situation which is adverse to the best interests of both the Brazilian and Mexican economies. The high production costs and low quality of fabric which have resulted from past policies are detrimental to the living standards of both countries. In addition, they have seriously limited the size of the domestic market for the products of the mills in each country. The paper concludes that in the interest of the overall economy in either country, new thinking is required on the subject of modernization, work loads and administrative practices in the textile industry, if this industry is to meet the increasing demands of these rapidly expanding economies...|$|R
