25|$|Born in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, Romney's {{first-class}} debut came against Leicestershire: he made 4 and 10 not out. In {{his next}} game against Oxford University he hit what {{proved to be}} his highest score, 20 not out (the second top score in the innings) as Worcestershire were dismissed for 121 (they went on to lose by three wickets). Poor displays against Gloucestershire and MCC followed, {{and that was that}} as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> first-class career was concerned.|$|E
25|$|Despite another decent {{domestic}} {{season in}} 1973, Birkenshaw was {{omitted from the}} England side for both series that summer (against New Zealand and West Indies), the 41-year-old Illingworth again being the barrier to his selection. However, there was no Illingworth on the winter tour to the Caribbean, and Birkenshaw played {{in the last two}} Tests. A total return of 2–96 and 15 runs in three innings was not enough to keep his place for the summer of 1974, and that was as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> England career lasted.|$|E

25|$|Tibetan {{history has}} often swung between {{centralized}} and stateless poles, and the epic of Gesar reflects {{the tensions between}} central authority, as embodied in religious orthodoxy, and the wild, nomadic forces of the autarkic periphery. There are versions that adopt Gesar as a lama showing him as a tamer of the wild, but, in so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> epic retains his old lineaments as a maverick master of shamanic powers, he represents the stateless, anarchic dimension of Tibet's margins, and is rather a tamer of corrupt monastic clerics and, thus, it is not coincidental that the epic flourished on the outlying regions of Kham and Amdo. His wars are campaigns of defence against hostile powers intent on subduing the kingdom of gLing, which are often construed as anti-Buddhist. But his vanquishing of the dzongs or fortresses preserves an ambiguity, since these were potential outposts of the state.|$|E
25|$|Dravid {{did well}} in the 3–2 series win against New Zealand in the {{bilateral}} ODI series, scoring 240 runs in 5 games {{at an average of}} 60 and a strike rate of 83.62, ending as the second highest scorer in the series. The highlight of the series was his inning in the second game at Hyderabad. He scored run-a-ball 153 runs – his career best effort – which included 15 fours and two sixes. He featured in a 331-run partnership with Tendulkar, which was the highest partnership in ODI cricket history, a record that stood for 15 years until it was broken in 2015. With this series, Dravid ended an eventful year, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> ODI career was concerned, on a high note. In 1999, Dravid scored 1761 runs in 43 ODIs at an average of 46.34 and a strike rate of 75.16 including 6 hundreds and 8 fifties and featured in two 300+ partnerships.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a general}} {{similarity}} running through the carved design of most races of primitive culture, the chip form of ornament being almost universally employed. Decorated surfaces depending almost entirely upon the incised line also obtain all over the world, and may no doubt {{be accounted for by}} the extensive use of stone cutting tools. The carver shows the same tendency to over-exalt his art by crowding on too much design as the more civilized craftsman of other lands, while he also on occasion exercises a good deal of restraint by a harmonious balance of decoration and plain space. So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> chip designs and those patterns more or less depending on the line are concerned, his work as a rule is good and suitable, but when he takes to figure work his attempts do not usually meet with success. Primitive carving, generally, shows that very similar stages of artistic development are passed through by men of every age and race.|$|E

[...] In the final four games of the season, matters got worse for Michigan and Maulbetsch, as the team went 0–3–1, scoring only 14 points in four games.|$|E

500|$|The only overtly hostile {{review was}} Oldmeadow's in The Tablet, which {{asserted}} that, after the disquiet in Catholic circles following {{the publication of}} Waugh's previous novel, his co-religionists [...] "reasonably hoped to find Mr Waugh turning over a completely new leaf. He has not done so". The review mixed literary criticism with moral sermonising, to which Waugh felt bound to object publicly. His friend, the journalist Tom Driberg agreed to place a notice in his [...] "William Hickey" [...] column in the Daily Express, in which Waugh accepted fully Oldmeadow's right to criticise the literary quality of the work [...] "in any terms he thinks suitable". However, he added, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> moral lecturing was concerned, Oldmeadow was [...] "in {{the position of a}} valet masquerading in his master's clothes.

500|$|The Pacific Northwest murders culminated on Sunday, July 14 {{with the}} broad {{daylight}} abductions {{of two women}} from a crowded beach at Lake Sammamish State Park in Issaquah, [...] east of Seattle. Five female witnesses described an attractive young man wearing a white tennis outfit with his left arm in a sling, speaking with a light accent, perhaps Canadian or British. Introducing himself as [...] "Ted," [...] he asked their help in unloading a sailboat from his tan or bronze-colored Volkswagen Beetle. Four refused; one accompanied him as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> car, {{saw that there was}} no sailboat, and fled. Three additional witnesses saw him approach Janice Anne Ott, 23, a probation case worker at the King County Juvenile Court, with the sailboat story, and watched her leave the beach in his company. About four hours later, Denise Marie Naslund, a 19-year-old woman who was studying to become a computer programmer, left a picnic to go to the restroom and never returned. Bundy told Stephen Michaud that Ott was still alive when he returned with Naslund—and that one was forced to watch as the other was murdered—but he later denied it in an interview with Lewis {{on the eve of his}} execution.|$|E
