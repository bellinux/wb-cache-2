To ensure that the books remained at a constant angle, Ramelli incorporated an epicyclic gearing arrangement, a complex device that had only previously been used in astronomical clocks.

While other people would go on to build bookwheels based on Ramelli's design, Ramelli did not in fact ever construct his own.|$|E

A nonlinear multi-gap planetary <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> finite element method model was established, and the engagement stress, the displacement, and the velocity curve with time of nodes of the planetary <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> were obtained by using explicit dynamic solution method. Under different speeds and different load, the variation of planetary <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> dynamic transmission error was then studied combined with the theory of gearing. The results showed that it is different from the dynamic transmission error of planetary <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> and planetary <b>gear.</b> Time-varying mesh stiffness of sun gear and the ring gear are also different along with their speed change. There are some correlation among time-varying mesh stiffness, meshing impact stress, and dynamic transmission errors. Therefore, it is suggested that the meshing stiffness and impact stress effect on the dynamic transmission error should be considered in the study of transmission error of wind turbine planetary <b>gear</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Geared</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been}} widely used in {{mechanical}} applications for more than a hundred years. A large range of literature has been published especially for spur/helical <b>gear</b> <b>systems</b> and the investigations into technical areas of spur/helical gears have been very well developed, including understanding of condition monitoring systems, diagnostic and prognostic methods. However, {{there is a lack of}} understanding on the general dynamic behavior of planetary <b>gear</b> <b>systems</b> with tooth faults. Planetary gears are normally used as effective power transmission elements with high power to weight/volume ratios, large speed reductions in compact volume, and high reliability. They tend to have high efficiency and are used in many applications, such as automotive, heavy truck/tractor, helicopter, wind turbines and bucket wheel reclaimer gearboxes. The purpose of this research is to develop a vibration analysis system that simulates dynamic behavior of large low speed, high torque planetary spur <b>gear</b> <b>systems</b> such as used in bucket wheel reclaimer and wind turbine gearboxes, with and without gear element faults. This thesis investigates lumped mass modelling methods for planetary gearbox dynamic behavior based on previous gearbox modelling research including the use of the coupled torsional-transverse behavior of the gear body. The dynamic model of the planetary spur <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> includes effects such as: variable tooth mesh stiffness, dynamic transmission error effects, and pitch and profile excitation for gear fault detection purposes. Different tooth faults are simulated using the concept of combined torsional mesh stiffness. The dynamics of spur planetary <b>gear</b> <b>systems</b> with and without tooth faults are compared and analyzed to improve the understanding of fault detection in the present <b>gear</b> <b>systems.</b> Dynamic modelling of <b>gear</b> <b>systems,</b> such as outlined in this thesis can assist in understanding the consequence of large transient events, including the fluctuations in tooth loads which can reduce gear fatigue life and lead to further tooth damage.
