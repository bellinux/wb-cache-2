40|$|Batteries used in <b>Implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> pacemakers-present unique {{challenges}} to their developers and manufacturers {{in terms of}} high levels of safety and reliability. In addition, the batteries must have longevity to avoid frequent replacements. Technological advances in leads/electrodes have reduced energy requirements by two orders of magnitude.

40|$|Background:There {{are over}} 4 million {{people around the}} world living with {{implanted}} cardiac devices. Modern pacemakers are small and light medical devices, which are implanted under local anaesthesia and provide therapy for a broad range of cardiac diseases. h ey are extremely safe, reliable and long lasting. h e aim {{of this paper is to}} present review of the development of implantable pacemakers from an engineering point of view since the i rst implanted device in October 1958 till today. Overview: Development of <b>implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> was enabled by another important invention, the silicon transistor. h ough the invention of suitable lithium cells as appropriate power supply was essential for prolongation of battery life cycle and for increased reliability of pacemakers, main milestones in the development were associated with technological breakthroughs in electronics: from transistors, which introduced such features as small size and low power consumption, to hybrid and integrated circuits, which enabled programmability, microprocessors, which added more options in programming (multiprogrammability), diagnostics and telemetry, and the ICT (information communication technology) that enabled physicians remote access to patients and interrogation of their implantable devices. Conclusions: Implantable pacemakers are reliable devices indicated for a wide range of dif erent therapies of cardiac rhythm disorders and heart failure. h ere is still a lot to learn about the physiology of a normal heart and even more about the failing heart. Modern pacemakers provide physicians valuable information from pacemakers’ memory via the built-in telemetry system. h ese information help physicians to better understand pathologic processes within the heart, thus contributing to the development of new ideas for treatment of diseases and for precise tailoring of the therapy to the patient’s needs.

40|$|The {{design of}} bug-free and safe medical device {{software}} is challenging, especially in complex implantable devices. This {{is due to}} the device 2 ̆ 7 s closed-loop interaction with the patient 2 ̆ 7 s organs, which are stochastic physical environments. The life-critical nature and the lack of existing industry standards to enforce software validation make this an ideal domain for exploring design automation challenges for integrated functional and formal modeling with closed-loop analysis. The primary goal of high-confidence medical device software is to guarantee the device will never drive the patient into an unsafe condition even though we do not have complete understanding of the physiological plant. There are two major differences between modeling physiology and modeling man-made systems: first, physiology is much more complex and less well-understood than man-made systems like cars and airplanes, and spans several scales from the molecular to the entire human body. Secondly, the variability between humans is orders of magnitude larger than that between two cars coming off the assembly line. Using the <b>implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> as an example of closed-loop device, and the heart as the organ to be modeled, we present several of the challenges and early results in model-based device validation. We begin with detailed timed automata model of the pacemaker, based on the specifications and algorithm descriptions from Boston Scientific. For closed-loop evaluation, a real-time Virtual Heart Model (VHM) has been developed to model the electrophysiological operation of the functioning and malfunctioning (i. e., during arrhythmia) hearts. By extracting the timing properties of the heart and pacemaker device, we present a methodology to construct timed-automata models for formal model checking and functional testing of the closed-loop system. The VHM 2 ̆ 7 s capability of generating clinically-relevant response has been validated for a variety of common arrhythmias. Based on a set of requirements, we describe a framework of Abstraction Trees that allows for interactive and physiologically relevant closed-loop model checking and testing for basic pacemaker device operations such as maintaining the heart rate, atrial-ventricle synchrony and complex conditions such as avoiding pacemaker-mediated tachycardia. Through automatic model translation of abstract models to simulation-based testing and code generation for platform-level testing, this model-based design approach ensures the closed-loop safety properties are retained through the design toolchain and facilitates the development of verified software from verified models. This system is a step toward a validation and testing approach for medical cyber-physical systems with the patient-in-the-loop...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the <b>implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> (PM) in 1958, bradycardia PM treatment has changed considerably. Both due to advancements in pacing technology, and because of a change in the profile of the mostly older PM patient, outcome data were in need of an update. This thesis provides a survey of several (long-term) outcomes of bradycardia pacing, updated to the modern era. Results are derived from the Dutch FollowPace study, which was started in 2003 and prospectively documented long-term outcomes in an unselected cohort of contemporary bradycardia PM recipients in 23 Dutch hospitals. The {{purpose of this study was}} to offer insight in the current practise and organisation of pacing in the Netherlands. We examined patient- and procedure-characteristics predictive for the different outcomes, in order to provide recommendations to improve the quality and the effectiveness of PM care. Some of the reported outcomes will be mentioned briefly. During a mean follow-up of 5. 8 (SD 1. 1) years, 12. 4 % and 9. 2 % of patients experienced a short- or a long-term complication of PM treatment, respectively. Although we found various independent predictors for complications, their ability to identify the patient at high risk is rather poor. Quality of life values were repeatedly measured during a 7. 5 year follow-up period. Values of general health perception remained improved over pre-implantation values, showing that PM treatment impacts positively on the well-being of the device recipient. Survival rates were 93 %, 81 %, 69 %, and 61 % after 1, 3, 5, and 7 years, respectively. When cardiac disease was absent, the survival rate was equal to that of controls from the general population. This outcome suggests that the prognosis of contemporary PM recipients is mainly determined by comorbid diseases and baseline heart disease. Frequent right ventricular apical pacing is generally believed to be associated with a higher incidence of heart failure events. We evaluated the association between different levels of right ventricular pacing in relation to heart failure death, and observed a significant linear association implicating a constant increase of 9 % risk of heart failure death per 10 % increase in percentage right ventricular. The management and regular technical check-up of the PM recipient comprises the major component of PM care. We analysed a total of 15472 in-hospital PM check-ups. In general, the quality of PM check-up is high and important parameters of pacing were examined in the vast majority of visits. However, the frequency of check-up was often less frequent than recommended by current guidelines. The proportion of check-ups that resulted in changes in patient management declined rapidly during follow-up: from 52 % in the first year after implantation to 17 % in the sixth year. This observation suggests that the frequency of check-ups might be reduced after the first year after implantation. Finally, we identified several predictors for more frequent PM reprogramming, as this might compromise benefit of new remote follow-up strategies. Prediction of the patient at high risk of more frequent reprogramming was hardly possible. But because most patients (> 80 %) didn’t require frequent reprogramming, a potential benefit of using remote follow-up to reduce the number of unnecessary in-office visits is suggested...|$|E

In this study, we present our experience with a simplified salvage technique for exposed <b>implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> electronic devices (ICEDs) without removing the implanted device, {{in an attempt to}} reduce the risks and complication rates associated with this condition. MethodsThe records of 10 patients who experienced direct ICED exposure between January 2012 and December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The following surgical procedure was performed in all patients: removal of skin erosion and capsule, creation of a new pocket at least 1. 0 – 1. 5 cm inferior to its original position, migration of the ICED to the new pocket, and insertion of closed-suction drainage. Patients with gross local sepsis or septicemia were excluded from this study. ResultsSeven patients had <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> and the other 3 had <b>implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> defibrillators.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of pacemaker patients {{among the general}} population and of conducted energy devices (CED) for law enforcement and self-defence is increasing. Consequently, the question whether <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> (CPM) patients are on particular risk becomes increasingly important. The risk of Taser X 26 electric interference with implanted CPM has been investigated by numerical simulation at MRI-based anatomical models of CPM patients with devices implanted at conventional sites (left pectoral, right pectoral and abdominal) and with the monopolar CPM electrode placed at the ventricular apex. In spite of 10 fold higher peak voltages the different coupling conditions make Taser-induced CPM interference voltages lower than those caused by external cardiac defibrillators. It is shown that electric interference considerably depends on ECD electrode orientation. The most unfavourable conditions are encountered with ECD electrodes aligned with the line from the CPM electrode tip to CPM can (EPC line). It could be shown that worst case interference voltages of monopolar pacemakers {{of any kind of}} implantation remain below the pulse immunity level as defined in safety standards of <b>implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> and of cardioverter defibrillators. However, interference voltages exceed CPM sensing thresholds.

The pacemaker software is life-critical as {{the timing of}} the pulses determine its ability to control the heart rate. Recalls due to software issues have been on the rise with the increasing complexity of pacing algorithms. Open-loop testing remains the primary approach to evaluate the safety of pacemaker software. While this tests how the pacemaker responds to stimulus, it cannot reveal pacemaker malfunctions which drive the heart into an unsafe state over multiple cycles. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of pacemaker software we have developed a heart model to generate different heart conditions and interact with real pacemakers.

As firmware-related recalls accounted for over 41 % of the 600, 000 devices recalled in the last decade, {{there is a need for}} rigorous model-driven design tools to generate verified code from verified software models. To this effect we have developed the UPP 2 SF model-translation tool, which facilitates automatic conversion of verified models (in UPPAAL) to models that may be simulated and tested (in Simulink/Stateflow). We describe the translation rules that ensure correct model conversion, applicable to a large class of models. We demonstrate how UPP 2 SF is used in the model-driven design of a pacemaker whose model is (a) designed and verified in UPPAAL (using timed automata), (b) automatically translated to Stateflow for simulation-based testing, and then (c) automatically generated into modular code for hardware-level integration testing of timing-related errors. In addition, we show how UPP 2 SF may be used for worst-case execution time estimation early in the design stage. Using UPP 2 SF, we demonstrate the value of integrated end-to-end modeling, verification, code-generation and testing process for complex software-controlled embedded systems...|$|R

Security measures that impede emergency access by physicians could be equally devastating. We propose that access keys be written into patients’ skin using ultraviolet-ink micropigmentation (invisible tattoos). 1 The IMD Key Storage Problem Life-critical implantable medical devices (IMDs) {{are becoming increasingly}} commonplace.
