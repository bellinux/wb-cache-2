5|$|Before her death, Aaliyah {{had planned}} to embark on the largest concert tour of her career to support the album. Her {{recording}} sessions for Aaliyah produced many leftover tracks that were posthumously archived by Blackground and mostly left unreleased because of internal conflicts and legal complications between the label, Aaliyah's family, and the producers. The compilation album <b>I</b> <b>Care</b> 4 U was released in 2002 and featured six previously unreleased songs from the sessions for Aaliyah.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, man, I'm just tired, and old, and bald, and fat, and grouchy, and bored. You know? So I {{was just}} like, I'm going to make this record, and do this stupid Ozzfest thing, and tell a bunch of stupid jokes in front {{of a lot of people}} at Download, then I'm just going to fuck off for a while. The bigger this gets, the less <b>I</b> <b>care,</b> to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don't wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other {{projects}} by doing it for the money. Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.|$|E
25|$|Others, like Mark Bauerlein, {{argue that}} professors in the {{humanities}} have increasingly abandoned proven methods of epistemology (<b>I</b> <b>care</b> only {{about the quality of}} your arguments, not your conclusions.) in favor of indoctrination (<b>I</b> <b>care</b> only about your conclusions, not the quality of your arguments.). The result is that professors and their students adhere rigidly to a limited set of viewpoints, and have little interest in, or understanding of, opposing viewpoints. Once they obtain this intellectual self-satisfaction, persistent lapses in learning, research, and evaluation are common.|$|E

25|$|Henry was in France {{with the}} Emperor Maximilian at {{the siege of}} Thérouanne. The Scottish Lyon King of Arms brought James IV's letter of 26 July to him. James asked him to desist from attacking France in breach of their treaty. Henry's {{exchange}} with Islay Herald or the Lyon King on 11 August at his tent at the siege was recorded. The Herald declared that Henry should abandon his efforts against the town and go home. Angered, Henry said that James {{had no right to}} summon him, and ought to be England's ally, as James was married to his (Henry's) sister, Margaret. He declared:And now, for a conclusion, recommend me to your master and tell him if he be so hardy to invade my realm or cause to enter one foot of my ground I shall make him as weary of his part as ever was man that began any such business. And one thing I ensure him by the faith that I have to the Crown of England and by the word of a King, there shall never King nor Prince make peace with me that ever his part shall be in it. Moreover, fellow, <b>I</b> <b>care</b> for nothing but for misentreating of my sister, that would God she were in England on a condition she cost the Schottes King not a penny.|$|E

Watts-Russell later said [...] "that's probably all I ever heard Joey really say," [...] and by that time, Santiago's quietness had been noted by those close to the band.

[...] He thought that until this episode the writers had been wise on guest stars and on not focusing on them too much; he also wrote that actors Lawrence and Valderrama did not seem to match each other. Handlen was rather impressed with the storylines of the [...] "red reality" [...] and gave the episode a [...] "B+", writing that [...] "Jake reminded [...] of Al Pacino's aging [...] in Donnie Brasco." [...] Sepinwall liked Jake's actor, Lawrence, praising his appearance on the Awake episode.|$|E

Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt, {{which was one of the}} calmest acts of reason.

500|$|Volk {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan in 1963. His decision to attend Michigan rather than Ohio State was influenced by family ties, including Bob Chappuis, who was Volk's uncle and {{finished second in the}} Heisman Trophy voting while playing for the undefeated 1947 Wolverines. Volk noted:"I had all these stories growing up. He [...] was my hero, so I always wanted to go to Michigan. ... And I didn't like Woody [...] anyway. It was just my Grandpa telling me because he didn't like Woody, and he hoped Woody would choke on his Thanksgiving turkey. ... Because of Uncle Bob going to Michigan, that's where I wanted to go.
