40|$|A {{number of}} {{statistical}} tools {{have been developed}} over the years for assessing the risk of reentering object to human populations. These tools {{make use of the}} characteristics (e. g., mass, material, shape, size) of debris that are predicted by aerothermal models to survive reentry. The statistical tools use this information to compute the probability that {{one or more of the}} surviving debris might hit a person on the ground and cause one or more casualties. The statistical portion of the analysis relies on a number of assumptions about how the debris footprint and the human population are distributed in latitude and longitude, and how to use that information to arrive at realistic risk numbers. Because this information is used in making policy and engineering decisions, it is important that these assumptions be tested using empirical data. This study uses the latest database of known uncontrolled reentry locations measured by the United States Department of Defense. The predicted ground footprint distributions of these objects are based on the theory that their orbits behave basically like simple Kepler orbits. However, there are a number of factors in the final stages of reentry - including the effects of gravitational harmonics, the effects of the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>equatorial</b> <b>bulge</b> on the atmosphere, and the rotation of the Earth and atmosphere - that could cause them to diverge from simple Kepler orbit behavior and possibly change the probability of reentering over a given location. In this paper, the measured latitude and longitude distributions of these objects are directly compared with the predicted distributions, providing a fundamental empirical test of the model assumptions...|$|E

50|$|An <b>equatorial</b> <b>bulge</b> is a {{difference}} between the equatorial and polar diameters of a planet, due to the force exerted by its rotation. A rotating body tends to form an oblate spheroid rather than a sphere. The Earth has an <b>equatorial</b> <b>bulge</b> of 42.77 km: that is, its diameter measured across the equatorial plane (12756.27 km) is 42.77 km more than that measured between the poles (12713.56 km). An observer standing at sea level on either pole, therefore, is 21.36 km closer to Earth's centrepoint than if standing at sea level on the equator. The value of Earth's radius may be approximated by the average of these radii.|$|R

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} dynamical {{processes that}} drive intraseasonal polar motion are examined with National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis data and with pole position {{data from the}} International Earth Rotation Service. The primary methodology involves the regression of different atmospheric variables against the polar motion excitation function. A power spectral analysis of the polar motion excitation function finds a statistically significant peak at 10 days. Correlation calculations show that this peak {{is associated with the}} 10 -day, first antisymmetric, zonal wavenumber 1, normal mode of the atmosphere. A coherency calculation indicates that the atmospheric driving of polar motion is mostly confined to two frequency bands, with periods of 7. 5 – 13 and 13 – 90 days. Regressions of surface pressure reveal that the 7. 5 – 13 -day band corresponds to the 10 -day atmospheric normal mode and the 13 – 90 -day band to a quasi-stationary wave. The regressions of pole position and the various torques indicate not only that the <b>equatorial</b> <b>bulge</b> torque dominates the mountain and friction torques but also that the driving by the <b>equatorial</b> <b>bulge</b> torque accounts for a substantial fraction of the intraseasonal polar motion. Furthermore, although the 10 -day and quasi-stationary wave contributions to the <b>equatorial</b> <b>bulge</b> torque are similar, the response in the pole position is primarily due to the quasi-stationary wave. Additional calculations of regressed power spectra and meridional heat fluxes indicate that the atmo-spheric wave pattern that drives polar motion is itself excited by synoptic-scale eddies. Regressions of pole position with separate torques from either hemisphere show that most of the pole displacement arises from the <b>equatorial</b> <b>bulge</b> torque from the winter hemisphere. Together with the above findings on wave–wave interactions, these results suggest that synoptic-scale eddies in the winter hemisphere excite the quasi-stationary wave, which in turn drives the polar motion through the <b>equatorial</b> <b>bulge</b> torque. 1...|$|R

30|$|Iapetus is {{a medium}} sized icy {{satellite}} of Saturn. It has two spectacular features: the equatorial ridge (ER) and the abnormally large flattening. The flattening is usually {{explained in terms}} of large non-hydrostatic fossil <b>equatorial</b> <b>bulge</b> (EB) supported by a thick lithosphere. Here we show, building on the principle of isostasy, that EB and ER could be a result of low density roots underlying the lithosphere below the equator. The low density matter formed the layer over the core of the satellite. Such situation was unstable. The instability led to origin of axially symmetric plumes that formed <b>equatorial</b> <b>bulge</b> and <b>equatorial</b> ridge. So, we explain both: EB and ER in the frame of one hypothesis.|$|R
50|$|Around a spherical body, an {{orbital plane}} would remain fixed in space around the central body.

5000|$|The {{gravitational}} {{attraction of}} the Sun and Moon on the Earth's <b>equatorial</b> <b>bulge</b> cause the rotational axis of the Earth to precess in space similar to the action of a top.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{observed}} data about the apsidal motion of gaseous rings around some Be stars, like Beta(1) Mon and Pi Aqr, cannot be explained solely by {{the influence of the}} <b>equatorial</b> <b>bulge.</b> This fact has prompted the development of a theory of apsidal motion and slow drift of orbital elements that is based on the mixing of slowly escaping gases from the central star with gases in the emission ring around it. Thus, the basic physical idea in this paper follows closely what has been advanced in the first paper of this series but the mathematical treatment has been broadened {{in order to deal with}} the actual orbits, instead of osculating orbits, of particles in the ring. In accordance with this theory, it is believed that in cases where no mixing of gases takes place, the apsidal motion is controlled solely by the <b>equatorial</b> <b>bulge.</b> But in cases where mixing takes place, the apsidal motion depends upon the manner of gas mixing as well...|$|R
