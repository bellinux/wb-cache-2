5|$|Rounded arches, vaults, and domes {{distinguish}} Roman architecture {{from that}} of Ancient Greece and were facilitated {{by the use of}} concrete and brick. By varying the weight of the aggregate material in the concrete, the weight of the concrete could be altered, allowing lighter layers to be laid at the top of concrete domes. But concrete domes also required expensive wooden <b>formwork,</b> also called shuttering, to be built and kept in place during the curing process, which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed. <b>Formwork</b> for brick domes need not be kept in place as long and could be more easily reused.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{structures}} was the Arch Hangar. At the time, {{it was the largest}} monolithic arch roof structure in the US, and one of the largest hangars in the world. The construction of the hangar was also groundbreaking, including a foundation set on bedrock, extensive footing structures, intricate <b>formwork,</b> and a 340-foot arch span.|$|E
5|$|The domes {{and drums}} {{typically}} incorporated wooden tension rings at several levels to resist deformation in the mortar {{and allow for}} faster construction. Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal tie rods, and metal chains were also used to stabilize domed buildings. Timber belts at the bases of domes helped to stabilize the walls below them during earthquakes, but the domes themselves remained vulnerable to collapse. The surviving ribbed or pumpkin dome examples in Constantinople are structurally equivalent and those techniques were used interchangeably, {{with the number of}} divisions corresponding to the number of windows. Aided by the small scale of churches after the 6th century, such ribbed domes could be built with <b>formwork</b> only for the ribs. Pumpkin domes could have been built in self-supporting rings and small domical vaults were effectively corbelled, dispensing with <b>formwork</b> altogether.|$|E

5000|$|The voided biaxial slabs <b>formworks</b> are {{positioned}} using the lateral spacers joints {{to place them}} at the desired centre distance that will determine the beam width. Thanks to the conic elevator foot, the <b>formworks</b> will be lifted from the surface, {{making it possible for}} the lower slab to be formed. If double or triple elements are used, these elements must first be assembled, which will be supplied on distinct pallets in the yard.|$|R

5|$|Initially, Nakashima, Francois Sammer (a Czech {{architect}} {{who had worked}} for Le Corbusier in Russia) and Chandulal (a devotee who had trained as an engineer), built a full-scale model of the dormitory in order to test the feasibility of the design, and then used it as a laboratory to further refine the construction methods. Nakashima's duties included doing very explicit detail drawings showing, for example, the design of the concrete <b>formwork.</b> Devotees even donated brass utensils so that they could be melted down to make door handles and hinges.|$|E
5|$|While {{there are}} earlier {{examples}} in the Republican period and early Imperial period, the growth of domed construction increased under Emperor Nero and the Flavians in the 1st century AD, and during the 2nd century. Centrally planned halls become increasingly important parts of palace and palace villa layouts beginning in the 1st century, serving as state banqueting halls, audience rooms, or throne rooms. <b>Formwork</b> was arranged either horizontally or radially, {{but there is not}} enough surviving evidence from the 1st and 2nd centuries to say what was typical.|$|E
5|$|The {{technique}} of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy {{in the late}} 3rd and early 4th centuries. By the 4th century, the thin and lightweight tubed vaulting had become a vaulting technique in its own right, rather than simply serving as a permanent centering for concrete. It was used in early Christian buildings in Italy. Arranging these terracotta tubes in a continuous spiral created a dome that was not strong enough for very large spans, but required only minimal centering and <b>formwork.</b> The later dome of the Baptistry of Neon in Ravenna is an example.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{techniques}} that he developed to achieve these forms, such as pre-stressing of brickwork and moveable <b>formworks,</b> were in advance of contemporary techniques in the developed world.|$|R

5|$|When Wright left Raymond {{set up his}} own office, he advertised {{himself as}} a {{specialist}} in reinforced concrete. He was aware of its textural properties from Cass Gilbert, its structural ones from Wright, and its benefits in relation to earthquake proofing. His first major independent project in 1921 was to design Hoshi Pharmaceutical School, {{which was one of}} the first reinforced concrete buildings in Tokyo. Raymond used precast concrete to form decorative elements for the building, such as window mullions. In a partially successful experiment, he used wooden <b>formwork</b> to imprint a texture onto the concrete (but he chose to cover it up).|$|E
5|$|While {{state of}} the art materials-handling methods were used, in some {{instances}} labour-saving machinery worked beside operations intended to maximise the labour content. Sustenance workers were employed chiefly for on-site preparation, road construction, foundation excavation, clearing timber from the reservoir basin, and on some concreting operations. Skilled workers were required on the dam for fixing the <b>formwork</b> where the concrete was poured. These workers were probably employed at normal day labour rates, the main employment method used on the project. Bulk handling of cement was also used {{for the first time in}} Australia, this saw a significant saving as opposed to bagged cement which was the standard practice of the day.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} is to {{construct}} foundations of the large columns that will support the elevated roadway of the YBITS. Above-grade column reinforcing is constructed and enclosed by <b>formwork</b> and concrete is poured. After curing, the <b>formwork</b> is then removed. The next step is to build the roadway itself. The spans were cast in place, using extensive reinforcing, with post-tensioned cable tendons. The roadways consist of hollow box structures, cast in place in sections using <b>formwork,</b> owing both to the complex shapes involved and the necessity of maintaining traffic flow on adjacent structures during construction.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{comparatively}} evaluate the workability of NC and SCC, casting {{times in the}} case of NC and SCC specimens were measured during casting of specimens. After <b>formworks</b> were detached, surface finish conditions were observed in order to evaluate the compacting ability of the NC and SCC specimens.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tower is}} made from {{concrete}} blocks which were made on the ground, lifted into position, and then cement-rendered inside and outside, a technique which eases building as {{it does not require}} <b>formworks</b> or scaffolding.

25|$|In addition, the {{contractor}} did not build in a slight upward incline in the <b>formwork</b> for the cantilever {{to compensate for}} the settling and deflection of the cantilever. Once the concrete <b>formwork</b> was removed, the cantilever developed a noticeable sag. Upon learning of the unapproved steel addition, Wright recalled Mosher.|$|E
25|$|Then {{interior}} <b>formwork</b> {{to support}} the upper (deck) surface was added and the rebar-pour process was repeated.|$|E
25|$|Building {{the tunnel}} {{structure}} required the pre-casting of 5 tunnel segments {{and an open}} boat unit. These were constructed in a casting basin located partially on {{the line of the}} tunnel south of the river at Mahon. Each segment weighed approx 27,000 tonnes. Contractors Tarmac Walls JV engaged RMD Kwikform, a global construction <b>formwork</b> and shoring solutions company, for the <b>formwork</b> on the tunnel and open section elements of the river crossing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tower is}} the sum of an {{architectural}} and structural thought particularly modern and exact. It is a reinforced concrete structure whose <b>formworks</b> are modular and repetitive, and the prefabricated fillings are re-used from the [...] "Notre-Dame du Raincy" [...] church. It provoked all criticisms during its construction but it is a success which cost half as much as the other edifices of the exhibition.|$|R
50|$|Engineered bamboo {{has been}} used as paneling, vehicle beds, {{concrete}} <b>formworks,</b> lightweight building construction and even for shelters after the 2004 tsunami. In comparison to the woods that have been traditionally used, a number of benefits and drawbacks have been identified. Lower cost, especially when replacing wood that would otherwise have been imported, is a key advantage. Further benefits include greater hardness and shape retention, especially in high temperatures.|$|R

30|$|The MCFT {{is based}} on a smeared, {{rotating}} crack model for reinforced concrete, in which cracked concrete is represented as an orthotropic material with a unique constitutive relation. VecTor 2 is a nonlinear finite element program that utilizes an incremental total load and iterative secant stiffness algorithm to produce an efficient and robust nonlinear solution. Additional information on VecTor 2 program is given in “VecTor 2 & <b>FormWorks</b> User’s Manual” by Wong (2002). Furthermore, the details of the constitutive models and their implementation into VecTor 2 software have been described by Vecchio (2000).|$|R
30|$|Like {{many new}} products, SCC {{was slow to}} gain popularity. It {{was used for the}} first time on a large scale for the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge in Japan in 1998 (Okamura 1997). It began to spread in Asian and European {{countries}} before the United States. It gained acceptance in the United States around the year 2000 (Okamura 1997). SCC has become more popular because of several advantages. It reduces labor, equipment, job noise, and time of construction. It also facilitates the filling of densely reinforced sections and complex <b>formworks</b> (ACI Committee 237 2007).|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this article}} was to {{determine}} blemishes of concrete surfaces and divide those surfaces according to following methods provided by two documents and by authors proposed image scanning method - “ImageJ”. The first method was CIB Report No. 24 “Tolerances on blemishes of concrete”. This method enables to evaluate concrete surfaces according to their visual appearance by using certain reference cards. The second method was GOST 13015. 0 - 83. This method enables to evaluate the concrete surfaces according to their biggest dimension of the blemishes. The third, authors proposed, method was “ImageJ”. Latter method is based on the free source computer program. It helps to establish the quantity and the dimensions of the blemishes in the desired scale. Authors suggested to imply a ration between blemishes area and the all specimen’s area as a factor for evaluation of concrete surface quality. Three different concrete compositions were made: BA 1, BA 7 and BA 8. Also, five different <b>formworks</b> were used: wood impregnated with polymeric oil [WPO], wood covered with rubber [WCR], sawn timber [ST], metal [M] and plastic [P] <b>formworks.</b> Following parameters of the obtained results were calculated: mean value, dispersion, standard deviation and the coefficient of variation. Also maximum and minimum values of experimental results are given. Intervals of the experimental results are provided for each specimen with the biggest possibility. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R

25|$|The Yerba Buena Island Transition Structure (YBITS) is an {{elevated}} roadway that bridges the gap from the SAS span to the Yerba Buena Island tunnel. Much like the Oakland Touchdown {{on the other}} side of the new bridge, this section of the bridge is also an end segment, meaning that the purpose of this segment is to transition portions of the existing bridge to the main spans of the new bridge. The connecting structure transitions the new bridge's side-by-side roadways to the upper and lower decks of the YBI tunnel. In mid-February 2012, the northern structure has been poured and <b>formwork</b> was being removed. In early September 2012, the falsework had been removed, modified, and constructed at the eastbound location with <b>formwork</b> completion now allowing reinforcing and concrete placement.|$|E
40|$|Prepacked {{aggregate}} concrete (PAC) {{is a type}} of concrete that is placed in two stages where the coarse aggregates are first placed inside the <b>formworks</b> and then the grout is pumped from underneath through a manual pump. Grout properties including density, grout consistency, bleeding, and compressive strength are of great importance in PAC. Such properties could be improved by application of pozzolanic materials like palm oil fuel ash. This paper is aimed at finding the most optimum percentage of POFA replacement by weight of cement. It was concluded that 30 % POFA replacement yielded the most optimum results...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a new {{retrofit}} method, {{which is}} called “Hybrid Wall Technique”, is proposed for ret-rofitting soft-story RC frames. In the proposed technique, steel plates encase the boundary RC columns, and connect to additional steel plates at the bay of the frame {{with the help of}} high-strength bolts. After installation of steel plates and high-strength bolts, which are also used as <b>formworks,</b> the additional concrete is cast. Structural performance of the proposed method is verified by experimental investiga-tions conducted on one-bay one-story RC frames. One non-retrofitted frame and three frames retrofit-ted by thick or thin hybrid walls were evaluated experimentally...|$|R
