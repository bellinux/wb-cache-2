30|$|The initial GC/MS {{analysis}} of the headspace samples from Anabaena 7120 used 50 – 500  m/z full scan, which identified <b>heptadecane</b> production. Based on the spectra obtained in the full scan of <b>heptadecane</b> and the internal standard tetracosane, we created an selected ion monitoring (SIM) method to use for future {{analysis of}} wildtype, DR 935, and complement strains DR 935 (pZR 2239), DR 935 (pZR 2248), and DR 935 (pZR 2243).

30|$|In a {{previous}} study of alkane production by cyanobacteria, <b>heptadecane</b> and pentadecane were cited as the most commonly produced alkanes (Schirmer et al. 2010). In our work, <b>heptadecane</b> was the predominant volatile alkane captured by Supelpak 2 SV resin (Sigma-aldrich) and detected in headspace of wildtype Anabaena 7120 culture. <b>Heptadecane</b> production was lost when alr 5283 – 84 were disrupted and re-emerged after complemented by intact alr 5283 and alr 5284 driven by their native promoters. Thus, the enzymes Alr 5283 and Alr 5284 from Anabaena 7120 are required for <b>heptadecane</b> production. Our findings are partially supported by previous reports, which detected a range of hydrocarbons produced by the ado/aar gene products from various cyanobacteria when the genes were expressed in E. coli (Schirmer et al. 2010) or in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Wang et al. 2013). Taken together, we conclude that the ADO/AAR enzymes encoded by alr 5283 – 84 are responsible for <b>heptadecane</b> production from a C 18 fatty acid substrate in Anabaena 7120.|$|E
40|$|<b>Heptadecane</b> is a {{volatile}} component of Spirulina platensis, and blocks the {{de novo synthesis}} of fatty acids and ameliorates several oxidative stress-related diseases. In a redox state disrupted by oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory genes are upregulated by the activation of NF-kB via diverse kinases. Thus, the search and characterization of new substances that modulate NF-kB are lively research topics. In the present study, <b>heptadecane</b> was examined {{in terms of its}} ability to suppress inflammatory NF-kB activation via redox-related NIK/IKK and MAPKs pathway in aged rats. In {{the first part of the}} study, Fischer 344 rats, aged 9 and 20 months, were administered on average approximately 20 or 40 mg/Kg body weight over 10 days. The potency of <b>heptadecane</b> was investigated by examining its ability to suppress the gene expressions of COX- 2 and iNOS (both NF-kB-related genes) and reactive species (RS) production in aged kidney tissue. In the second part of the study, YPEN- 1 cells (an endothelial cell line) were used to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of <b>heptadecane</b> by examining its modulation of NF-kB and NF-kB signal pathway. Results showed that <b>heptadecane</b> exhibited a potent anti-oxidative effect by protecting YPEN- 1 cells from tert-butylhydroperoxide induced oxidative stress. Further molecular investigations revealed that <b>heptadecane</b> attenuated RS-induced NF-kB via the NIK/IKK and MAPKs pathways in YPEN- 1 cells and aged kidney tissues. Based on these results, we conclude that <b>heptadecane</b> suppresses age-related increases in pro-inflammatory gene expressions by reducing NF-kB activity by upregulating the NIK/IKK and MAPK...|$|E
30|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the amount of}} <b>heptadecane</b> produced from wildtype Anabaena 7120, DR 935, and DR 935 (pZR 2239) strains during the first 5  days of the experiment. Overall, <b>heptadecane</b> production was higher in the wildtype (WT 7120) compared to the complemented strain DR 935 (pZR 2239) and undetectable in the DR 935 (Fig.  4 d).|$|E
30|$|In this research, <b>heptadecane</b> was {{consistently}} {{found in the}} headspace of the cultures. Another study reported more than 80 % of hydrocarbons produced by Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 were found outside the cells (Schirmer et al. 2010). In this study, under normal growth conditions (30  °C, normal light) growth of the mutant culture {{did not appear to}} be impacted by the loss of <b>heptadecane</b> production. Thus, under these conditions, though <b>heptadecane</b> is produced in small amounts, it is not required for survival and normal growth. However, it is possible that alkanes are required for response to certain stress conditions. Research has indicated that alkane production may be related to stress tolerance under various conditions, such as cold, high salinity, and high light (Berla et al. 2015; Bhadauriya et al. 2008; Kageyama et al. 2015; Takatani et al. 2015). In addition to abiotic stress responses, alkanes have also shown antibacterial activity in the cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis (Ozdemir et al. 2004). It is also possible that <b>heptadecane</b> has a function that is duplicated by another compound in the cell, such that when <b>heptadecane</b> is not produced, its vital function is still carried out.|$|E
40|$|Cyanobacterial lipid {{droplets}} (LDs) {{are packed}} with hydrophobic energy-dense compounds and have great potential for biotechnological expression and the compartmentalization of high value compounds. Nostoc punctiforme normally accumulates LDs containing neutral lipids, and small amounts of <b>heptadecane,</b> during the stationary phase of growth. In this study, we further enhanced <b>heptadecane</b> production in N. punctiforme by introducing extrachromosomal copies of aar/adc genes, and report {{the discovery of a}} putative novel lipase encoded by Npun_F 5141, which further enhanced alkane production. Extra copies of all three genes in high light conditions resulted in a 16 -fold higher accumulation of <b>heptadecane</b> compared to the wild type strain in the exponential phase. LD accumulation during exponential phase also increased massively to accommodate the <b>heptadecane</b> production. A large number of small, less fluorescent LDs were observed at the cell periphery in exponential growth phase, whereas fewer number of highly fluorescent, much larger LDs were localized towards the center of the cell in the stationary phase. These advances demonstrate that cyanobacterial LDs are an ideal model platform to make industrially relevant compounds, such as alkanes, during exponential growth, and provide insight into LD formation in cyanobacteria...|$|E

30|$|With {{its high}} carbon content, <b>heptadecane</b> confers {{valuable}} fuel traits such as higher cetane number and oxidative stability, which {{are associated with}} long carbon chains and saturation (Quintana et al. 2011). Cyanobacteria present themselves as ideal fuel producers given their photosynthetic ability to convert CO 2 to fuel using only the solar energy. Extraction processes often constitute 70 – 80 % of production costs (Liu et al. 2011). Thus, in organisms which do not naturally secrete target compounds, further genetic engineering steps are required to enable product secretion from the cell (Liu et al. 2011). Our findings show that the extraction process is bypassed in hydrocarbon production by Anabaena 7120 since <b>heptadecane</b> was naturally secreted from the cells and captured from the headspace.|$|E
30|$|Further, the {{heterologous}} expression of FAR and FADO genes in E. coli produced {{a mixture of}} primary alcohol and 1 -aldehyde along with pentadecane and <b>heptadecane</b> (Schirmer et al. 2010), however, these alcohol and aldehyde intermediates were not detectable {{in the analysis of}} our TDR transformant.|$|E
30|$|The {{heterologous}} {{expression of the}} S. elongatus PCC 7942 codon optimized FAR and FADO in A. carbonarius ITEM 5010 resulted {{in the production of}} alkanes, specifically pentadecane and <b>heptadecane,</b> which have not previously been seen produced by this fungus (Sinha et al. 2015). These results concur with the findings of Schirmer et al. (2010), where the FAR and FADO were tied to the production of mostly these two alkanes in cyanobacteria. Therefore, we assume that in the TDR transformant, the production of pentadecane and <b>heptadecane</b> follows a similar pathway to the one described in cyanobacteria, where FAR reduces Cn fatty acyl-ACP to Cn fatty aldehyde, which is further converted to Cn− 1 alkane by FADO. Based on this, the production of C 15 : 0 and C 17 : 0 alkanes such as pentadecane and <b>heptadecane</b> would require C 16 : 0 (palmitic acid) and C 18 : 0 (stearic acid) fatty acid intermediates, which matches the fatty acid profile of A. carbonarius as shown by the FAMEs results. The proportion of the detected fatty acids is shown by the FAMEs analysis, indicating that oleic and linoleic acid are more abundant in the cells compared with palmitic and stearic acid in both the TDR and the parent strain. This corresponds with the fatty acid composition observed in other species of Aspergillus (Fraga et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of irradiation on the chemical attributes of sausages, TBARS values, volatile compounds, gas compounds, and hydrocarbons of vacuum-packaged sausages were analyzed during 60 d of refrigerated storage. A sulfur-containing volatile compound (dimethyl disulfide), a gas compound (methane), and radiation-induced hydrocarbons (1 -tetradecene, pentadecane, <b>heptadecane,</b> 8 -heptadecene, eicosane, 1, 7 -hexadecadiene, hexadecane) were mainly detected in irradiated sausages, and the concentrations of the compounds were irradiation dosedependent. Especially methane and a few hydrocarbons were detected only in irradiated sausages and their amounts were dose-dependent. On the other hand, TBARS values, other off-odor volatiles (carbon disulfide, hexanal), and gas compounds (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide) were found both in irradiated and nonirradiated sausages. Therefore, it is suggested that irradiation-induced hydrocarbons (1 -tetradecene, pentadecane, <b>heptadecane,</b> 8 -heptadecene, eicosane, 1, 7 -hexadecadiene, hexadecane), dimethyl disulfide, and methane can be used as markers for irradiated sausages...|$|E
30|$|A {{complementation}} {{experiment was}} required to confirm that two genes (ado and aar), rather than a downstream gene alr 5285 (acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha subunit), are responsible for DR 935 mutant phenotype (loss of <b>heptadecane</b> production). The replicating plasmid pRL 2833 a (Wolk et al. 2007) and its derivative pZR 670 (Chen et al. 2016) had been successfully used for complementing many knock-out mutants in Anabaena 7120 (Chen et al. 2016; Fan et al. 2005; Xu et al. 2015). The glnA promoter is a constitutive expression promoter and is up-regulated by nitrogen starvation (Flaherty et al. 2011). The glnA promoter was successfully used for complementing alr 4853 mutant in Anabaena 7120 (Xu et al. 2015). DR 935 (pZR 2248) contained both genes in a two gene operon (ado–aar) under the glnA promoter, yet did not recover <b>heptadecane</b> production. Importantly, among the complement plasmids used to recover <b>heptadecane</b> production in the ado/aar knockout mutant DR 935, only the plasmid pZR 2239 containing the genes controlled by their native promoter system was able to complement the mutant. Since {{the only difference between}} the complement strains was the promoter system used, the non-native promoter systems used in DR 935 (pZR 2248) and DR 935 (pZR 2243) are likely responsible for the failure of complementation. It is possible that the constitutive glnA promoter used in the unsuccessful complements did not function as optimally as the native promoters for either aar or ado.|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of the composite crystal urea/heptadecane was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The lattice constants of the hexagonal substructures are a = 8. 218 (2), b = 8. 218 (3), ch = 11. 017 (3) Å for the urea (host) structure and cg = 23. 713 (1) Å for the <b>heptadecane</b> (guest) structure, respectively. The (3 + 1) -dimensional space group is P 6122 (00 ρ) 01 ̄ 1 ̄. Refinements on 786 reflections converged to wR = 0. 0232 for 608 main host reflections, wR = 0. 1506 for 10 main guest reflections, wR = 0. 0328 for 49 common main reflections and wR = 0. 753 for 119 pure satellite reflections. A comparison of the refinement of only the urea substructure and a refinement of the whole composite crystal, including the guest subsystem and the mutual modulations of both subsystems, shows that the main reflections, previously assigned to the urea host exclusively, are affected by a nonnegligible contribution of the <b>heptadecane</b> satellite scattering. The modulation of the guest structure has a maximum when the CH 2 groups of the <b>heptadecane</b> molecule are facing the channel walls at heights corresponding to troughs in this wall. Thus, the modulation of the guest structure can be interpreted by an adaptation of the guest molecules to the host structure. The modulation of the host structure {{was found to be}} very weak, as the satellite scattering of the host structure is low. ψ-scans of the 00 l reflections revealed that the observed violation of the 61 screw axis extinction rule of the host structure and guest structure modulation can be explained by considerable umweganregung. ...|$|E

This research sought to identify specific genes required for photosynthetic production of alkanes to enable future metabolic engineering for commercially viable production of alkanes. The two putative genes (alr 5283 and alr 5284) required for long-chain hydrocarbon production in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 were knocked out through a double crossover approach.

The analytical prediction in terms of outlet temperature was validated with experimental data. Furthermore, influences of some important design parameters (e. g. inner radius and thickness of the tube) on cooling effect were investigated. It was found that an optimum inner radius and thickness of the tube should be considered to design an LHS system.
