40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of {{antifoam}} agents on bubble characteristics in bubble columns is studied. Specifically, the bubble characteristics of air in tap water are compared to those of air in 5 % and 10 % antifoam solutions. Bubble characteristics such as gas holdup, bubble diameter, bubble-size distribution, and damping ratio were investigated at various superficial <b>gas</b> <b>velocities.</b> These properties were deduced from the acoustic sound measurement. The study revealed that the addition of antifoam chemicals reduces the overall gas holdup and increases the average bubble diameter. The bubble-size distribution in tap water {{is found to be}} homogeneous while in antifoam solutions to be heterogeneous. It is also found that at low <b>gas</b> <b>velocities</b> the damping ratio for antifoam solutions is higher than that for tap water, while at high <b>gas</b> <b>velocities</b> the damping ratio is not affected.

40|$|This {{study is}} the first to {{directly}} correlate <b>gas</b> transfer <b>velocity,</b> measured at sea using the eddy-correlation (EC) technique, and satellite altimeter backscattering. During eight research cruises {{in different parts of the}} world, <b>gas</b> transfer <b>velocity</b> of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) was measured. The sample times and locations were compared with overpass times and locations of remote sensing satellites carrying Ku-band altimeters: ERS- 1, ERS- 2, TOPEX, POSEIDON, GEOSAT Follow-On, JASON- 1, JASON- 2 and ENVISAT. The result was 179 pairs of <b>gas</b> transfer <b>velocity</b> measurements and backscattering coefficients. An inter-calibration of the different altimeters significantly reduced data scatter. The inter-calibrated data was best fitted to a quadratic relation between the inverse of the backscattering coefficients and the <b>gas</b> transfer <b>velocity</b> measurements. A <b>gas</b> transfer parameterization based on backscattering, corresponding with sea surface roughness, might be expected to perform better than wind speed-based parameterizations. Our results, however, did not show improvement compared to direct correlation of shipboard wind speeds. The relationship of <b>gas</b> transfer <b>velocity</b> to satellite-derived backscatter, or wind speed, is useful to provide retrieval algorithms. Gas transfer velocity (cm/hr), corrected to a Schmidt number of 660, is proportional to wind speed (m/s). The measured <b>gas</b> transfer <b>velocity</b> is controlled by both the individual water-side and air-side <b>gas</b> transfer <b>velocities.</b> We calculated the latter using a numerical scheme, to derive water-side <b>gas</b> transfer <b>velocity.</b> DMS is sufficiently soluble to neglect bubble-mediated gas transfer, thus, the DMS transfer velocities could be applied to estimate water-side <b>gas</b> transfer <b>velocities</b> through the unbroken surface of any other gas Key Points: - Show relations between altimeter data and field values of air-sea gas transfer - DMS <b>gas</b> transfer <b>velocity</b> can be used to estimate direct gas transfer of any gas - Direct <b>gas</b> transfer <b>velocity</b> (for Sc = 660) is roughly double 10 m wind spee...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Gas-liquid microreaction {{technology}} {{presents a}} typical means of process intensification in multiphase reactors, which has shown great potential in many gas-liquid reactions of industrial importance. The product capacity of gas-liquid microreactor is realized by performing gas-liquid contacting in {{a multitude of}} microchannels. During this numbering- up process, one important issue is to design proper fluid distributors {{in order to ensure}} two- phase flow equi-partition among parallel microchannels. In this article, the idea of integrating two multi-scale constructal distributors into a 16 -channel gas-liquid microreactor {{to solve the problem of}} two-phase flow maldistribution is presented. CO 2 -water two-phase flow pattern in parallel microchannels of the present microreactor has been visualized. A large two-phase flow maldistribution was observed at comparatively low superficial <b>gas</b> <b>velocities</b> where the uniform flow pattern was slug flow, which was characterized by the presence of liquid alone flow in many microchannels. Nevertheless, an improvement in two-phase flow uniformity was found at increased superficial <b>gas</b> <b>velocities</b> and most microchannels were occupied by slug-annular flow at much high superficial <b>gas</b> <b>velocities.</b> A further fluid dynamic analysis has demonstrated that the lack of large pressure barrier in two constructal distributors was the main cause responsible for the observed two-phase flow maldistribution at small superficial <b>gas</b> <b>velocities.</b> Under these circumstances, pressure fluctuations accompanied slug flow would greatly disturb an otherwise nearly uniform flow distribution inside each constructal distributor. However, at comparatively high superficial <b>gas</b> <b>velocities,</b> the uniform flow pattern turned to be slug-annular flow and the flow in each distributor was hardly affected by two-phase flow in the subsequent microchannels. Thus the tree architectures of both distributors could guarantee a nearly uniform two-phase flow distribution, as our CFD simulation correctly reflected. Finally, further improvement of the present microreactor design was discussed. École Polytechnique de Montréa...|$|R
