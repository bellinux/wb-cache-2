5|$|Named for Sienkiewicz, in Poland, are {{numerous}} streets and squares (the first street to bear {{his name was}} in Lwów, in 1907). Named <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> Białystok's Osiedle Sienkiewicza; city parks in Wrocław and Łódź; and over 70 schools in Poland. He has statues {{in a number of}} Polish cities, including Warsaw's Łazienki Park (the first statue was erected at Zbaraż, now in Ukraine), and in Rome A Sienkiewcz Mound stands at Okrzeja, near his birthplace, Wola Okrzejska. He has been featured on a number of postage stamps.|$|E
5|$|William's feast day {{is celebrated}} on 8 June, {{the day of}} his death, {{although}} his veneration is largely localised to York. Traditional iconography and windows often depict William's crossing of the Tweed; some iconography shows him crossing in a boat. William's coat of arms traditionally depicts seven mascles or lozenges. St William's College, which was named <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> next to York Minster. It was established between 1465 and 1467 with the permission of King Edward IV as the home for chantry priests of the Cathedral. His remains were rediscovered in the 1960s and are now in the crypt at York Minster.|$|E

25|$|Hesiod {{certainly}} predates {{the lyric}} and elegiac poets whose work {{has come down}} to the modern era. Imitations of his work have been observed in Alcaeus, Epimenides, Mimnermus, Semonides, Tyrtaeus and Archilochus, from which it has been inferred that the latest possible date <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> about 650 BC.|$|E
25|$|The king then {{removes his}} crown {{as a sign}} of humility and devotion and {{proceeds}} to the Chakkraphat Phiman residence with chamberlains and pages bearing the royal regalia following him. Waiting <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> a chapter of monks, who had officiated the night before. The king will then receive a formal blessing from the Supreme Patriarch himself and then a blessing from the entire congregation of monks. An offering of yellow robes is made by the king to all the monks. The benediction service will then conclude with the extinguishing of the Candle of Victory by a senior monk. With the religious part of the coronation finished the monks retire from the palace.|$|E

25|$|Musetta {{suddenly}} appears; Mimì, {{who took}} {{up with a}} wealthy viscount after leaving Rodolfo in the spring, has left her patron. Musetta found her {{that day in the}} street, severely weakened by her illness, and Mimì begged Musetta to bring her to Rodolfo. Mimì, haggard and pale, is assisted onto a bed. Briefly, she feels as though she is recovering. Musetta and Marcello leave to sell Musetta's earrings in order to buy medicine, and Colline leaves to pawn his overcoat (Vecchia zimarra—"Old coat"). Schaunard leaves with Colline to give Mimì and Rodolfo some time together. Mimì tells Rodolfo that her love <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> her whole life (aria/duet, Mimì and Rodolfo: Sono andati?—"Have they gone?").|$|E
25|$|Poirot is less active {{during the}} cases that {{take place at the}} end of his career. Beginning with Three Act Tragedy (1934), Christie had perfected during the inter-war years a subgenre of Poirot novel in which the detective himself spent much of the first third of the novel on the {{periphery}} of events. In novels such as Taken at the Flood, After the Funeral, and Hickory Dickory Dock, he is even less in evidence, frequently passing the duties of main interviewing detective to a subsidiary character. In Cat Among the Pigeons, Poirot's entrance is so late as to be almost an afterthought. Whether this was a reflection of his age or of Christie's distaste <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> <b>is</b> impossible to assess. Crooked House (1949) and Ordeal by Innocence (1957), which could easily have been Poirot novels, represent a logical endpoint of the general diminution of his presence in such works.|$|E
25|$|Proteus insinuates {{that he will}} rape her ("I'll force thee {{yield to}} my desire"), but at this point, Valentine {{intervenes}} and denounces Proteus. Horrified at what has happened, Proteus vows that the hate Valentine feels <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> {{nothing compared to the}} hate he feels for himself. Convinced that Proteus' repentance is genuine, Valentine forgives him and seems to offer Silvia to him. At this point, overwhelmed, Julia faints, revealing her true identity. Upon seeing her, Proteus suddenly remembers his love for her and vows fidelity to her once again. The Duke and Thurio are brought as prisoners by the outlaws. Seeing Silvia, Thurio claims her as his, but Valentine warns Thurio that if he makes one move toward her, he will kill him. Terrified, Thurio renounces Silvia. The Duke, disgusted with Thurio's cowardice and impressed by Valentine's actions, approves his and Silvia's love, and consents to their marriage. The two couples are happily united, and the Duke pardons the outlaws, telling them they may return to Milan.|$|E

25|$|A new villainous Star Sapphire {{debuted in}} Green Lantern Vol 5 #21 (August 2013). Prixiam Nol-Anj {{was a former}} {{prisoner}} of the Oan sciencells, imprisoned for a slew of different crimes: racketeering, smuggling, extortion, murder for hire, abduction, trafficking in organisms, larceny, grand theft starship, and assault with an energy weapon. Over time, she uses her wiles to beguile her guard, a Green Lantern named Cossite, and he {{falls in love with}} her. When Larfleeze attacks Oa {{in the aftermath of the}} First Lantern's defeat and the death of the Guardians, his constructs kill a Star Sapphire who arrived to aid in the defense of the planet. The fallen Sapphire's ring flies to Nol-Anj's cell, where it declares her eligible to become a Star Sapphire herself. Nol-Anj persuades Cossite that the ring's presence is proof that her love <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> true, and he readily opens the door and allows her to slip the ring onto her fingers and acquire its power. To his understandable shock, she then kills him, declaring that the love in her heart that the ring detected was not for him, but for the Clann she belonged to, that accepted her when no one else would.|$|E
500|$|Several {{geographic}} {{features are}} named for him. Brunner, originally called Brunnerton, {{is a small}} settlement on the Grey River inland from Greymouth where he first found coal. It {{is the site of}} the former Brunner Mine, best known for New Zealand's worst mine disaster in 1896. Lake Brunner is located some [...] by road from here, upstream along the Arnold River; Brunner went there after his coal discovery. Another feature named <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> the Brunner Range, which is located east of the valley through which the Inangahua River flows. A plaque to his memory lies in the Nelson Cathedral.|$|E
500|$|Similarly to the {{characters}} created by Osamu Tezuka and his Star System, Sakura {{was based on}} the protagonist of Clamp's previous manga Cardcaptor Sakura, Sakura Kinomoto, and her relationship with Syaoran Li. Both Sakura and Syaoran's counterparts from Cardcaptor Sakura had a happy ending; Clamp said that the Tsubasa protagonists would have to overcome trials throughout the series to get their [...] "own happy ending". Sakura losing her memories of Syaoran and struggling to once again develop feelings <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> one of the main themes of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, showing the value of relationships throughout the series.|$|E

500|$|Ponche de Leona {{delivered}} Mucho Macho Man {{three weeks}} after her due date. [...] At birth, the foal was lifeless with no heartbeat. Farm staff tried to revive him by massaging and shaking him. [...] He was unresponsive for several minutes, then his eyes opened and he [...] "just got up and galloped away". As a result, his foalhood nickname was [...] "Lazarus". [...] In {{addition to being a}} late foal, he was very big and hence slow to reach full development. Because the young horse was so tall and skinny, John Rio called him [...] "Mr. Green Jeans", though no one else did. [...] His official name is derived from the Village People song [...] "Macho Man", and owner Dean Reeves' nickname <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Macho".|$|E
500|$|Several of the show's crew praise Bumpass for his {{performance}} and similitude to the character. Kenny called Bumpass [...] "brilliant" [...] and said, [...] " [...] {{is sort of}} like Squidward". Staff writer Kent Osborne said, [...] "I remember thinking about how much Rodger talks and acts like Squidward. That's why it's such a good voice—he's so connected to it". However, Bumpass said, [...] "I'm not him and he's not me, but what I'm required to do for him and what I am enabled to do <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> what makes it like me. It fits my particular talents and skills very well. So in that respect, yeah, he is me, but I am not the cranky, sarcastic, underachieving kind of guy that he is. He's easy to fall in, I will say that." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{few of the}} Robinsons {{actually}} {{tried to}} actively take revenge on the occupying forces. The most famous of these, who became a local legend, was an individual known only as [...] "Ares" [...] (after the Greek god of war), described by Gluth-Nowowiejski, {{based on interviews with}} the Robinsons he conducted. Ares, active in the Śródmieście district, staged numerous ambushes of German soldiers, in at least one case using an improvised explosive device. According to Gluth-Nowowiejski's sources, he would leave behind graffiti of his name, as well as slogans such as [...] "Hitler kaput". Other messages included communications to the German soldiers. In one case he dumped a body of a soldier he had killed with the note: [...] "This awaits all of you in Warsaw". In another he wrote: [...] "Ares is a ghost, not matter – your search <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> useless". Eventually, Ares met his demise when the Germans left some poisoned food for him to find. Soon they discovered a man in the ruins who was obviously sick from having eaten it. He shot at them before taking his own life. According to some sources, other individuals took on Ares' struggle but used the names of other Greek Gods as their signature.|$|E
