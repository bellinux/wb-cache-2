25|$|In {{contrast}} to their leaders who had accepted Christianity, the Havolane population still worshipped old Slavic deities and opposed Albert's assumption of power. Jaxa of Köpenick, a possible relative of Pribislav and a claim-holder to Brandenburg, controlled Brandenburg with Polish help, and ruled {{the land of}} the Stodorans. Older historical research dates this conquest to 1153, although there are no definite sources for the date.

25|$|During {{this time}} two life-changing events occurred. The first {{was when he}} {{returned}} to settle for a time in Florence in November 1484 and met Lorenzo de' Medici and Marsilio Ficino. It was an astrologically auspicious day that Ficino had chosen to publish his translations of the works of Plato from Greek into Latin, under Lorenzo's enthusiastic patronage. Pico appears to have charmed both men, and despite Ficino's philosophical differences, he was convinced of their Saturnine affinity and the divine providence of his arrival. Lorenzo would support and protect Pico until his death in 1492. Without Lorenzo's support <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> Pico would have survived the Inquisition coming after him.|$|E
25|$|The interpretable {{geologic}} {{history of}} the Kuiper quadrangle is primarily a record of decreasing meteoroid flux during which large craters and basins formed and plains materials were deposited. A decreasing rate of crater production is indicated by progressively fewer craters in each successively younger crater class. Approximately half of the mapped area contains a high density of craters and multiringed basins formed by the intense early bombardment. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> any primary crustal material has been preserved without brecciation and redistribution by repeated impacts. The present crater population represents only the craters surviving {{at the end of}} the stage of highest meteoroid flux. As the impact flux decreased, cratered plains materials of possible volcanic origin were deposited in broad, low-lying areas, flooding, embaying, or partially burying preexisting craters. The youngest multiringed basins (Renoir, Rodin, and the unnamed basin at 15° S., 15°) formed near the end of this stage (about c3 time), as did the Caloris Basin on the opposite side of the planet (McCauley and others, 1981; Schaber andMcCauley, 1980). Craters that formed still later during the period of low impact rates are well preserved. During this late stage, smooth plains materials were deposited in basins, craters, and localised low areas and have low crater density. The youngest craters are sharp rimmed with bright rays.|$|E
5000|$|With an {{aphelion}} (furthest {{distance from}} the Sun) of only 2.6 AU, P/2010 A2 spends all of its time inside of the frostline at 2.7 AU.

25|$|At this point, Tacfarinas sent envoys to Rome {{to offer}} peace {{in return for}} land in the {{province}} {{for himself and his}} followers. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> this implied a desire by Tacfarinas' men to become sedentary farmers. More likely, they simply sought restored access to their traditional grazing grounds. If his demands were not met, Tacfarinas warned, he would wage a war without end on the Romans. Although this was probably a serious offer, Tiberius was outraged. He considered it the height of impudence that a man whom he regarded as a deserter and common brigand should be demanding terms like a foreign head of state. The offer was dismissed and Tacfarinas resumed hostilities. Tiberius now demanded that the Senate appoint an especially experienced general to command in Africa so that Tacfarinas could be dealt with once and for all. The man selected by Tiberius was Quintus Junius Blaesus, a veteran who as governor of Pannonia had narrowly escaped lynching by his troops in the great mutinies that broke out on Tiberius' accession in 14 AD. Blaesus owed his selection to his nephew, Sejanus, Tiberius' commander of the Praetorian Guard and trusted right-hand man. For the task, Tiberius gave Blaesus an additional legion (the IX Hispana, transferred from Pannonia on the Danube) and its attached auxiliary regiments, doubling the total force in Africa to around 20,000. He also authorised Blaesus to offer a general pardon to any of Tacfarinas' associates who surrendered - but not to Tacfarinas himself, who was to be captured or killed at all costs.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein had an {{important}} influence on Russell as he himself discusses in his My Philosophical Development. He led him, for example, to conclude, much to his regret, that mathematical truths were purely tautological truths, however <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> Wittgenstein actually held this view, which he discussed in relation to logical truth, since {{it is not clear}} that he was a logicist when he wrote the Tractatus. What is certain is that in 1901 Russell's own reflections on the issues raised by the paradox that takes his name Russell's Paradox, led him to doubt the intuitive certainty of mathematics. This doubt was perhaps Russell's most important 'influence' on mathematics, and was spread throughout the European universities, even as Russell himself laboured (with Alfred North Whitehead) in an attempt to solve the Paradox and related paradoxes, such as Burali-Forti. As Stewart Shapiro explains in his Thinking About Mathematics, Russell's attempts to solve the paradoxes led to the ramified theory of types, which, though it is highly complex and relies on the doubtful axiom of reducibility, actually manages to solve both syntactic and semantic paradoxes at the expense of rendering the logicist project suspect and introducing much complexity in the PM system. Philosopher and logician F.P. Ramsey would later simplify the theory of types arguing that there was no need to solve both semantic and syntactic paradoxes to provide a foundation for mathematics. The philosopher and logician George Boolos discusses the power of the PM system in the preface to his Logic, logic & logic, stating that it is powerful enough to derive most classical mathematics, equating the power of PM to that of Z, a weaker form of set theory than ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel Set theory with Choice). In fact, ZFC actually does circumvent Russell's paradox by restricting the comprehension axiom to already existing sets by the use of subset axioms.|$|E

50|$|The FDC {{benefited from}} this disquiet, and when Besigye {{returned}} to Uganda, {{he found the}} FDC had considerable support even within {{the ranks of the}} NRM. This factor prompted Museveni to arrest Besigye. Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> Besigye could win an election against Museveni, {{the fact that he was}} attracting support from the NRA (now renamed the Uganda People's Defence Force) members brought the spectre of a split in the army. The FDC had many ex-NRA commanders in its ranks, including the former army commander Mugisha Muntu. Another factor was that many of these politicians were from the same region of Uganda as Museveni and, therefore, they could attract support from the president's own backyard.|$|R

30|$|The {{correlation}} between the latent factors of the 2 -Factor model was very strong (0.91) (Fig.  2). Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> the two factors represented distinct constructs, i.e. they provided poor discriminant validity. The 1 -factor model {{has the advantage of}} parsimony over the 2 -factor model (Brown 2006). Moreover; the model fit indices did not reveal any significant difference(s) in the performance of the two models (Table  4). In conclusion, the outcome of the EFA, when taken together with the results of the Parallel Analysis, the large correlations between the two latent factors (Fig.  2), the overlapping values of model fit indices, and the parsimony of 1 -factor model over 2 -factor model, collectively validate the unidimensionality of the PSQI in this population of collegiate young adults.|$|R
