5|$|Smith {{organised}} {{a meeting}} with Johnston, starting at 09:00 on 18 August, where he informed the British High Commissioner that he had considered the Lisbon appointment extensively, {{with the help of}} Dupont, several legal advisers, and a judge of the Rhodesian High Court. The judge had examined the relevant documents, and had {{come to the conclusion that}} Dupont's interpretation of them was correct. Smith therefore <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> that Reedman's appointment was legitimate so long as Portugal agreed. A long argument ensued, with neither man willing to budge. Smith said that he had always tried to be flexible and civil, but that he and his government felt they had to make a stand. By making clear to Lisbon the exact nature of their proposed representative, and informing Britain of their intent, Smith said the Rhodesians had filled every legal obligation.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{mounted a}} third attack {{late in the}} afternoon, around 3:00. Several times German {{soldiers}} attempted to penetrate the American lines. The Americans left their foxholes and in close combat fired on the attackers to push them back down the hill. At one point PFC Milsovech spotted a medic working on and talking to a soldier he <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> was already dead. As mortar fire on his position got more accurate, Milsovech noticed a pistol on the supposed medic's belt, and decided he must be calling in fire on their position. He shot and killed him. Bouck contacted Regimental Headquarters once more, seeking reinforcements. At 3:50, Fort sent the unit's last update to Regimental headquarters in Hünningen. He reported they were still receiving some artillery fire but were holding their position against an estimated enemy strength of about 75, who were attempting to advance from Lanzerath towards the railroad to the northwest.|$|E
5|$|With 17minutes remaining, a Birmingham chance arose when Murphy outpaced Dave Ewing. Goalkeeper Trautmann dived at {{the feet}} of Murphy to win the ball, but in the {{collision}} Murphy's right knee hit Trautmann's neck with a forceful blow. Trautmann was knocked unconscious, and the referee stopped play immediately. Trainer Laurie Barnett rushed onto the pitch, and treatment continued for several minutes. No substitutes were permitted, so Manchester City would have to see out the game with ten men if Trautmann was unable to continue. Captain Roy Paul <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> that Trautmann was not fit to complete the match, and wished to put Roy Little in goal instead. However, Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, insisted upon keeping his goal. He played out the remaining minutes in great pain, with the Manchester City defenders attempting to clear the ball well upfield or into the stand whenever it came near. Trautmann was called upon to make two further saves to deny Brown and Murphy, the second causing him to recoil in agony due to a collision with Ewing, which required the trainer to revive him.|$|E

25|$|He {{strongly}} opposed the communists that {{had left the}} socialist party in January 1921, and <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> sympathy for fascism in its initial phase. Like many other intellectuals and politicians of all persuasions, he saw fascism as an extreme defence against the dangers of Bolshevism, but condemned its recourse to violence. In August 1921 he applauded the agreement between socialists and fascists {{to put an end}} to the civil war. His death on 2 September 1921, saved him from, with the benefit of hindsight, an embarrassing adhesion of fascism.|$|E
25|$|The USSR {{seemed to}} have {{completed}} {{the formation of a}} monolithic Soviet bloc and concluded the partition of Europe, which appeared to vindicate and certainly crystallized the pessimistic, darkest appraisals of Soviet power in the West by people who <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> that it was folly to try to do business with Moscow. Because its impact was equally profound in Western Europe as in the United States, it helped unify Western countries against the Communist bloc. It gave an air of prescience to the French and Italian governments for having forced their local Communists out of their governments a year earlier.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Western Front commander, Mikhail Tukhachevsky, <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> {{that all}} was going {{according}} to his plan. However, Polish military intelligence had decrypted the Red Army's radio messages, and Tukhachevsky was actually falling into a trap set by Piłsudski and his Chief of Staff, Tadeusz Rozwadowski. The Soviet advance across the Vistula River in the north was moving into an operational vacuum, as there were no sizable Polish forces in the area. On the other hand, south of Warsaw, where {{the fate of the}} war was about to be decided, Tukhachevsky had left only token forces to guard the vital link between the Soviet northwest and southwest fronts. Another factor that influenced the outcome of the war was the effective neutralization of Budyonny's 1st Cavalry Army, much feared by Piłsudski and other Polish commanders, in the battles around Lwów. At Tukhachevsky's insistence the Soviet High Command had ordered the 1st Cavalry Army to march north toward Warsaw and Lublin. However, Budyonny disobeyed the order due to a grudge between Tukhachevsky and Yegorov, commander of the southwest front.|$|E

25|$|Hart's {{imminent}} move to WCW {{created a}} tense situation, {{as he had}} won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1997 from The Undertaker. Hart's WCW contract was scheduled to begin on December 5, {{one month after the}} WWF's annual Survivor Series event, which was to be held in Montreal. Shawn Michaels, the leader of the emerging stable D-Generation X had been booked into a main event title match with Hart. McMahon, anxious for Hart to give up the title, sought Hart's consent to job to Michaels. Hart didn't want to give up the title to a member of The Kliq (which included Michaels, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Hunter Hearst Helmsley and Sean Waltman), apparently standing up {{for the rest of the}} locker room. As part of their rivalry storyline, Michaels had repeatedly performed acts insulting the Canadian flag and Canadian fans, which had also upset Hart. Wrestling fans also knew of Hart's long-standing personal difficulty with Michaels—Hart had been angered at Michaels' forfeiture of the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in February 1997, which ruined plans for a Hart–Michaels rematch at WrestleMania 13 where Michaels was expected to lose the title to him. Hart also believed that Michaels had faked a knee injury and talked about major surgery just to get out of their planned match. While Michaels denied rumors that he did not want to lose to Hart, and indeed Hart wound up winning the title shortly after Michaels relinquished it, Hart <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> that Michaels would not have offered a loss in return if he had been staying with the WWF. The two had been involved in a real fight after Michaels implied that Hart was having an affair with WWF valet Sunny. The recent storyline rivalry had also seen Michaels make insulting remarks about Hart's father Stu Hart, which had left Bret and others in the Hart family upset. McMahon's offering of an estimated $3 million contract to Hart in 1996 had reportedly also upset Michaels.|$|E
500|$|In November 1988, RJR set {{guidelines}} {{for a final}} bid submission {{at the end of}} the month. The management and Shearson group submitted a final bid of $112, a figure they <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> would enable them to outflank any response by Kravis and KKR. KKR's final bid of $109, while a lower dollar figure, was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of RJR Nabisco. KKR's offer was guaranteed, whereas the management offer lacked a [...] "reset", meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated $112 per share.|$|E

Stoddart asked Kolles if he would be entering his cars and was informed that Jordan would indeed be racing, despite having previously agreed not to. Stoddart was then approached by a Bridgestone representative and told that Bridgestone wanted him to race; he has also stated that given his [...] "current relationship with Mr Mosley, [...] <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> heavy sanctions would follow if [...] did not [...]" [...] Stoddart too decided to enter his drivers, but reported that he would retire them if the Jordans did not finish the race.|$|E
500|$|In 1978, geophysicists Glen Penfield and Antonio Camargo {{were working}} for the Mexican {{state-owned}} oil company Petróleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, {{as part of an}} airborne magnetic survey of the Gulf of Mexico north of the Yucatán peninsula. Penfield's job was to use geophysical data to scout possible locations for oil drilling. In the data, Penfield found a huge underwater arc with [...] "extraordinary symmetry" [...] in a ring [...] across. He then obtained a gravity map of the Yucatán made in the 1960s. A decade earlier, the same map suggested an impact feature to contractor Robert Baltosser, but he was forbidden to publicize his conclusion by Pemex corporate policy of the time. Penfield found another arc on the peninsula itself, the ends of which pointed northward. Comparing the two maps, he found the separate arcs formed a circle, [...] wide, centered near the Yucatán village Chicxulub; he <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> the shape had been created by a cataclysmic event in geologic history.|$|E
500|$|After Shearson Lehman's {{original}} bid, KKR quickly {{introduced a}} tender offer to obtain RJR Nabisco for $90 per share—a price that enabled it to proceed without {{the approval of}} RJR Nabisco's management.

500|$|On March 25, 1865, the {{regiment}} {{fought in the}} Battle of Fort Stedman, the Confederate Army's final offensive during the Siege of Petersburg. [...] Before dawn on March 25, Confederate troops achieved complete surprise and easily occupied Fort Stedman entering the rear sally port almost unchallenged. [...] Major Charles T. Richardson, then {{in command of the}} 29th, hearing some light gunfire, ordered the 29th to fall in. [...] No general alarm had yet been raised, but Richardson <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> that an attack was underway. [...] Within minutes, approximately 500 Confederates, {{a small part of the}} overall offensive, swept over Battery 11. [...] The 29th held their ground, however, engaging in heated hand-to-hand combat and eventually capturing 300 Confederates—more than twice their own number. [...] The Confederates still occupied Fort Stedman, however, and soon sent another offensive to occupy Battery 11. [...] This time, the 29th was forced to retreat back to Fort Haskell, the nearest defensible position.|$|E
500|$|Rodney was ill, {{and spent}} the entire action in his bunk.

[...] Around 2:00 pm, when Rodney <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> that the ships seen were not the vanguard of a larger fleet, he issued commands for a general chase. [...] Rodney's instructions to his fleet were to chase at their best speed, and engage the Spanish ships from the rear as they came upon them. [...] They were also instructed to sail to the lee side to interfere with Spanish attempts to gain {{the safety of a}} harbour, a tactic that also prevented the Spanish ships from opening their lowest gun ports. [...] Because of their copper-sheathed hulls (which reduced marine growths and drag), the ships of the Royal Navy were faster and soon gained on the Spanish.|$|E
500|$|Ion Storm {{contracted}} Soundelux Design Music Group {{to provide}} music for Anachronox. The firm hired Bill Brown for additional music. Tom Hall {{was impressed with}} Brown's work, particularly music for the planet Democratus. Hall worked with musician Ron Jones and a local Dallas band to record the game's two funk numbers by mid-1998. Tom Hall planned for each character {{to have their own}} theme music, and for songs to change via interaction or exploration. He spoke of the planned music, [...] "The Anachronox sound will be industrial, mixed with forties bluesy swing. As you get on later in the game, the music gets scarier, more chaotic, and gets down to hard-core metal." [...] Developers integrated DirectMusic support in 1999 to allow dynamic changing of background music. Sound programmer Henrik Jonsson implemented 3D sound and other capabilities using the Miles Sound System. Developers also planned to use software called Magpie Pro to lip-sync animated mouths to spoken words. The team chose not to record voices for each line of dialogue, as Tom Hall <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> speech would become repetitive. The Undermain Theatre group of Dallas provided several voices. Tom Hall voiced PAL-18 reportedly because [...] "no one else got it goofy enough".|$|E

500|$|Piquet {{said it was}} a mixed day for {{his team}} {{considering}} that he had achieved the pole position and that he made a quick getaway at the start but was disappointed with his eleventh-place finish. He claimed that the incident with López may have happened to any other driver but was looking forward to the next race of the season where he hoped to qualify in a good position and his team were going to keep pushing. Bird was disappointed with the result, saying it was beneficial if the technical problems with his second at the pit stop were diagnosed in the season's first race rather than later on. His teammate López thanked the sport's fans for voting him to receive the Fan Boost and was upbeat despite retiring from his maiden ePrix: [...] "The car is fast and I think qualifying proved that. I’m sure the end result will be much, much better in Marrakech." [...] Vergne told the press that he lost the chance to achieve a strong result in the race when his car developed problems with his car's water pump and described the event as [...] "a big mess" [...] but <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> that he could secure the championship.|$|E

His team was concerned over his battery overheating; Buemi stated that he drove cautiously {{in the first few}} laps to know where he was and that he had the entire car package under control. Second-place finisher Vergne stated that he was [...] "very happy" [...] because of his team being recently new having had no prior testing of his car and all new personnel and equipment. He said he corrected the problems he had in the season's first two races and <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> that he would place his focus into winning races: [...] "I think the whole team did a fantastic job, working really, really hard, sometimes many hours overnight and in the end it paid off." [...] Di Grassi, who finished in third, said {{that it was a good}} day for his team although he acknowledged that he was not on the same pace levels as the e.Dams-Renault cars. He revealed that his first car had a large amount of oversteer and stated every smallest change would make a large difference in terms of the championship.|$|E
500|$|In Haygarth's Cricket Scores and Biographies, Roe is {{described}} as a [...] "fine, free hitter with excellent defence", who could also [...] "bowl a very useful medium-paced ball". He got more of a go at Cambridge during his third year, playing five matches for the university side in 1882. Roe, who was known for his cricket tales, related a tale from one match that season in which the weather was so cold that catches were difficult to take. George Nash, the Lancashire professional, was missed off every ball of an over from Robert Ramsay. [...] "C. T. Studd bowled the next ball, and a catch came to me at mid-off, the crowd began to boo, and I <b>felt</b> <b>certain</b> I should not make the catch, but by great good fortune the ball stuck!" [...] Roe did not excel with bat or ball in any of his five university matches, and was not selected for the match against Oxford University {{at the end of the}} season. In his final year at Cambridge, Roe played seven times for the university, and achieved his Blue—the awarding of the Cambridge [...] "colours" [...] to sportsmen—by appearing in the University match against Oxford. He was out without scoring any runs in his only innings of the match, which Cambridge won by seven wickets. In all, during his time at Cambridge, Roe played 13 first-class matches for the university, scoring 246 runs at an average of 11.18, with just one score greater than 50. He also took ten wickets at 15.60.|$|E
