5|$|Room of Mars: is {{characterized}} by works by Rubens: the allegories representing the Consequences of War (<b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the room) and the Four Philosophers (among them Rubens portrayed himself, on the left). On the vault is a fresco by Pietro da Cortona, Triumph of the Medici.|$|E
5|$|Tourists {{and locals}} visit the cliffs {{on the western}} side of the {{peninsula}} for views of the ocean and the sunset - <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>name,</b> Sunset Cliffs. There are surfing spots below the cliffs, such as Luscomb's, Garbage Beach, and New Break. The cliffs are unstable and can be dangerous; a woman died in a fall from the cliffs in December 2008, and other falls have resulted in injuries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of {{some species}} of {{guineafowl}} {{refer to the}} Meleagrids: Numida meleagris and Agelastes meleagrides. Also <b>the</b> family <b>name</b> for turkeys is Meleagrididae.|$|R
5000|$|Kucha: a zone with houses whose owners shared {{some common}} attribute, usually their occupation. <b>Hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> Maliwara, <b>the</b> gardeners' {{neighbourhood}} and Ballimaran, the oarsmen’s neighbourhood.|$|R
50|$|Kewdale is {{a suburb}} of Perth, Western Australia within the City of Belmont. Kew Street {{was one of the}} first roads in this district, <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>naming</b> of <b>the</b> suburb.|$|R
5|$|Salem Chapel {{stands on}} land {{which had been}} part of the old Napoleonic Barrack Ground. <b>Hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> for the nearby Waterloo Road. The land was {{auctioned}} in 1839, and in the following year the purchaser, a Mr George Gould, himself a Baptist, sold two plots fronting the London Road for the erection of a Baptist Chapel. The land was purchased and fenced for the sum of £300 which was raised by way of a mortgage. The original meeting room, (now the Church Parlour) was built and opened in July 1840. The present chapel was completed and opened in 1847.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Plains of Abraham, {{also known}} as the Battle of Quebec (Bataille des Plaines d'Abraham, or Première bataille de Québec in French), was a pivotal battle in the Seven Years' War (referred to as the French and Indian War in the United States). The battle, which began on 13 September 1759, was fought by the British Army and Navy against the French Army on a plateau just outside the walls of Quebec City, on land that was {{originally}} owned by a farmer named Abraham Martin, <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the battle. The battle involved fewer than 10,000 troops between both sides, but proved to be a deciding moment in the conflict between France and Britain over the fate of New France, influencing the later creation of Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} had {{the potential}} to spark another international war since Wolfgang William wanted to have the still not demobilized army of Lorraine, which continued to operate in the region despite the Peace of Westphalia, to intervene on his side, and Frederick William sought support of the Dutch Republic. The latter however followed a policy of neutrality and refused to aid Frederick William's campaign, which was furthermore opposed by the Imperial estates as well as the local ones. Politically isolated, Frederick William aborted the campaign after the Treaty of Cleves negotiated by Imperial mediators in October 1651. The underlying religious dispute was only solved in 1672. While military confrontations were avoided and the Brandenburg-Prussian army was primarily occupied with stealing cattle (<b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>name),</b> it considerably lowered Frederick William's reputation.|$|E
5000|$|... 1817 - Building of the Waterloo Bridge {{near the}} Poldrate Mill. The {{foundation}} stone was {{laid on the}} anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>naming</b> of <b>the</b> bridge.|$|R
50|$|According to legends, {{the city}} was the summer {{residence}} of Seleucus I, <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>naming.</b> An inscription, found on a stone between two cypress in the village, dates its foundation to 98 BC.|$|R
2500|$|Stabilimenta among N. clavipes are {{sometimes}} {{seen in the}} webs of immatures nearing molt, <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> [...] "molting webs" [...] or [...] "skeleton webs" [...] (webs with radial strands but no spiral elements).|$|R
5|$|The war {{was fought}} on two fronts, on land near Corinth (<b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>name)</b> and Thebes and at sea in the Aegean. On land, the Spartans {{achieved}} several early successes in major battles, but {{were unable to}} capitalize on their advantage, and the fighting soon became stalemated. At sea, the Spartan fleet was decisively defeated by a Persian fleet early in the war, an event that effectively ended Sparta's attempts to become a naval power. Taking advantage of this fact, Athens launched several naval campaigns in the later years of the war, recapturing a number of islands that {{had been part of}} the original Athenian Empire during the 5th century BC.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{founded the}} field of game theory as a {{mathematical}} discipline. Von Neumann proved his minimax theorem in 1928. This theorem establishes that in zero-sum games with perfect information (i.e. in which players know at each time all moves {{that have taken place}} so far), there exists a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses, <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> minimax. When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider all the possible responses of his adversary. The player then plays out the strategy that will result in the minimization of his maximum loss.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{was first}} {{described}} in 1782 by the French botanist Pierre Bulliard and still bears its original name. The starting date of fungal taxonomy {{had been set}} as January1, 1821, {{to coincide with the}} date of the works of the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries, which meant the name required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid, as Bulliard's work preceded this date. It was thus written Boletus edulis Bull.:Fr. A 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus' work, the Species Plantarum. <b>Hence,</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority. Early alternate names include Boletus solidus by English naturalist James Sowerby in 1809, and Gray's Leccinum edule. Gray's transfer of the species to Leccinum was later determined to be inconsistent with the rules of botanical nomenclature, and he apparently was unfamiliar with the earlier works of Fries when he published his arrangement of bolete species.|$|E
50|$|However, most {{of these}} {{qualifications}} are subjective, repetitive, and highly stereotypical; <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> are chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Such names are usually given by court historians, according to their good deeds or the bad ones.|$|R
50|$|A charge {{amplifier}} is an electronic current integrator {{that produces a}} voltage output proportional to the integrated value of the input current. This is effectively a measurement of the electrical input charge; <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>naming</b> of <b>the</b> device.|$|R

5|$|In 1895 and 1897, Cantor {{published}} a two-part paper in Mathematische Annalen under Felix Klein's editorship; these were his last significant papers on set theory. The first paper begins by defining set, subset, etc., {{in ways that}} would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of the continuum hypothesis, but had to settle for expositing his theory of well-ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if A and B are sets with A equivalent to a subset of B and B equivalent to a subset of A, then A and B are equivalent. Ernst Schröder had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. Felix Bernstein supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem.|$|E
5|$|The brown roll-rim was {{described}} by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1785 as Agaricus contiguus, although the 1786 combination Agaricus involutus of August Batsch is taken as the first valid description. James Bolton published a description {{of what he called}} Agaricus adscendibus in 1788; the taxonomical authority Index Fungorum considers this to be synonymous with P.involutus. Additional synonyms include Omphalia involuta described by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821, and Rhymovis involuta, published by Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst in 1844. The species gained its current binomial name in 1838 when the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries erected the genus Paxillus, and set it as the type species. The starting date of fungal taxonomy had been set as January1, 1821, to coincide with the date of Fries' works, which meant that names coined earlier than this date required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid. It was thus written Paxillus involutus (Batsch:Fr.) Fr. However, a 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus' seminal work, the Species Plantarum. <b>Hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority.|$|E

50|$|A {{community}} called Woollam {{has existed}} at two nearby locations, <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> New Woollam and Old Woollam. A post office called Woollam {{was established in}} 1853, and remained in operation until 1932. The community most likely was named after a local merchant.|$|R
50|$|They feed {{on small}} rodents, <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> common <b>name</b> gopher snake.|$|R
25|$|In Aardvarks, teeth lack enamel {{and have}} many pulp tubules, <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> {{of the order}} Tubulidentata.|$|E
25|$|This {{particular}} {{reaction was}} discovered by J.M. Eder (<b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Eder reaction) in 1880 and reinvestigated by W. E. Rosevaere in 1929.|$|E
25|$|La Quemada was {{abandoned}} {{after the fall}} of Tula in 1222. It was burned down <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> La Quemada, Quemada being Spanish for burned.|$|E
50|$|A second use of {{the term}} was to refer to the ecclesiastical list of poor {{pensioners}} who were assisted from <b>the</b> church revenues; <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> matricularii, matriculariae, by which persons thus assisted, together with those who performed menial services about the church, were known.|$|R
50|$|The {{complete}} set is a humanistic {{model of the}} Renaissance cosmos. The letter “E” of the first group, for “Estates” (of Man) in Italian was changed to the letter “S” for “Stations” between the E and S series, <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> for <b>the</b> two series.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dedication}} {{ceremony for}} Sesquicentennial Chapel {{took place on}} June 7, 1959. The year it took place was Miami University’s sesquicentennial anniversary, <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> <b>naming</b> of <b>the</b> chapel.
