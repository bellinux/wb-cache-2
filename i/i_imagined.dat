The line of description called for Logan to [...] "devour" [...] Veronica. I wanted it to be—I don't know if sexual is the right word, but—hungry, or a release, or mixed with some self-loathing and confusion. Instead, it came off as singularly romantic." ...|$|E

500|$|In March 1998, André 3000 and Big Boi {{purchased}} a studio off Northside Drive in Atlanta which had formerly belonged to R singer Bobby Brown. [...] The studio had sentimental {{value for the}} duo, {{as it was the}} first place the two had ever recorded vocals together, on a remix of TLC's [...] "What About Your Friends" [...] (1992). [...] The two named the studio [...] "Stankonia", a word created by André 3000 as a combination of the words [...] "stank", a slang synonym for [...] "funky", and [...] "Plutonia", the title of a poster in his bedroom depicting a futuristic city.

500|$|After the Battle of Berlin {{ended in}} early May 1945, Limanskaya was {{assigned}} to direct traffic at the Brandenburg Gate during the Potsdam Conference in late July. While conducting her duties, she was photographed, filmed, and also interviewed by Eugeny Haldey, a journalist employed by Tyelyegrafnoye Agyentstvo Sovyetskogo Soyuza ("Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union"; TASS), a state news agency. Her picture was widely published in newspapers and magazines worldwide and she quickly became an iconic image of the victory over Nazi Germany. She furthermore had a brief conversation with the British leader Winston Churchill as his entourage was passing by the gate {{on their way to}} Potsdam. Limanskaya later said about her meeting Churchill, [...] " [...] looked precisely the way <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> him, puffing on a cigar".|$|E
500|$|To other reviewers, Captain Scarlet {{remains a}} [...] "camp classic" [...] that, in Bould's opinion, relates well to other Anderson {{productions}} {{due to a}} common depiction of [...] "a utopian future benefiting from world government, high technology, ethnic diversity, and a generally positive sense of Americanisation. They articulate the commonly made connection between technological developments and economic prosperity." [...] He also states that Captain Scarlet espouses [...] "Euro-cool consumerism". The concept of world government is common to Anderson's work and was inspired by his thoughts on the matter at the time: [...] "I had all sorts of fancy ideas about the future... we had the United Nations and <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> {{that the world would}} come together and there would be a world government."

500|$|In {{planning}} the set lists for the tour, Byrne initially considered only promoting this album {{but decided to}} include songs from his previous collaborations with Eno as well, including the TalkingHeads albums MoreSongsAboutBuildingsandFood, FearofMusic, and RemaininLight and Byrne's TheCatherineWheel soundtrack. By playing music from all of their collaborations, Byrne hoped to [...] "draw a line linking this new material with what we did 30years ago" [...] {{with the goal of}} clarifying the connection between all of the duo's previous work. In reviewing their past music, he found that [...] "here might be more continuity than <b>I</b> <b>imagined,</b> which I hope is going to work in my favor." [...] Although Eno was invited to participate and early reports indicated that he would, Eno ultimately chose not to tour with Byrne, letting Byrne decide how to present this music live.|$|E
500|$|The entire sub-plot {{featuring}} Susanne Modeski {{caused a}} minor continuity error {{that had to}} be retconned. Bruce Harwood, the actor who portrayed Byers, originally wore a wedding ring when he first portrayed the character, noting, [...] "I'd worn my wedding ring [...] so <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> a married life for Byers". During the filming of [...] "Unusual Suspects"—an episode that would largely feature Byers feeling a romantic connection to Susanne—Harwood removed his wedding ring, deducing that in 1989, when the episode took place, Byers had not been married yet. However, [...] "Three of a Kind"—which takes place in 1999—features Byers once again romantically drawn to Susanne. Harwood explained, [...] "And then [...] brought back the character Suzanne [...] Modeski back in season six, and {{that was supposed to be}} in the present. So I had to redo my back story; I said Byers had been divorced".|$|E

500|$|Bumblebees {{appear as}} characters, often eponymously, in {{children}}'s books. The surname Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series (1997–2007) {{is an old}} name for bumblebee. J. K. Rowling said the name [...] "seemed to suit the headmaster, because one of his passions is music and <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> him walking around humming to himself". Among the many books for younger children are Bumble the Bee by Yvon Douran and Tony Neal (2014); Bertie Bumble Bee by K. I. Al-Ghani (2012); Ben the Bumble Bee: How do bees make honey? by Romessa Awadalla (2015); Bumble Bee Bob Has a Big Butt by Papa Campbell (2012); Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!

500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by {{the cast and crew}} of The X-Files. Producer J.P. Finn praised the episode and Carter's directing, saying [...] "We were all pretty nervous doing that one, because Chris Carter was a new director. It turned out that he directed very...It was a great script, a great cast, and he ended up directing a home run. One of the charming things about it was the end, where we had these alien heads placed on young children. It was so endearing to see them on the set between takes, playing with Chris and everyone". Actor David Duchovny said of Carter's directing [...] "Chris came in meticulously prepared, which is his nature. I think his first episode was great". Carter himself described it as one of his favorite episodes because [...] "it was a chance for me to sort of do it all, and it came out in ways better than <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> it would".|$|E

[...] Prior to the airing of the Connor family's arrival on the famous cobblestone street in August 2006, Thompson commented, [...] "I can't say too much about Ryan and the story lines, but he's very mischievous. The character is not a bad lad, but he's not a good lad either." [...] Garth Philips, series producer, said at the time, [...] "We held extensive casting sessions to get this family right, and the energy that Sean, Rob, Kym and Ben have will certainly make them a joy to watch on screen."

500|$|Although {{this was}} his 12th {{published}} novel, Irving said that Last Night in Twisted River was [...] "20 years in the making". The idea for a novel about a cook and his son on the run {{had been in the}} back of his mind for as long ago as 1986. Irving, who likes to start his novels with the last sentence, said in an interview with The Independent in October 2009: [...] "For the longest time the last sentence eluded me, but 20 years ago <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> a novel about a cook and his young son who become fugitives; who have to run from some violent act that will follow them. And it was always in a kind of frontier town — a place where there was one law, and it was one man, who was single-minded and bad." [...] Irving did not start writing the novel until 2005. Speaking to the BBC World Service in October 2009, Irving explained that he found that last sentence on his way to a doctor's appointment. He said an old Bob Dylan CD was playing [...] "Tangled Up in Blue" [...] in his car, and when he heard the lyrics: ...|$|E
500|$|Code: Veronica {{producer}} Shinji Mikami said [...] "Claire {{became a}} lot tougher than <b>I</b> <b>Imagined.</b> I thought she should look the same, but the game director made her that way because she had such an experience in Resident Evil 2, she could handle any situation now!" [...] For Revelations 2, the now hardened and aggressive Claire was redesigned to be a contrasting character to the young, immature and easily scared Moira Burton, who {{was defined as a}} purely supporting character, and they both serve different roles in the story and have different functions. Producer Michiteru Okabe said: [...] "Really, only after did we look back and say, 'Oh, I guess they are both girls.' Which is good, because it means we’re treating them as whole characters and not just as their gender. What we settled on is the idea that you have different roles -- it isn’t two against the world, it’s one against the world with a helper." [...] Okabe also said the game's writer Dai Satō [...] "is a big fan of her personally" [...] {{which was one of the}} factors that led to Claire's return.|$|E
500|$|After the 2000s, {{the effects}} of poptimism {{attracted}} a belief that once a pop star reaches {{a certain level of}} stardom, many critics will safeguard them from negative reviews. Richards argued that poptimism cheerleads the already successful while privileging consensus and smothering dissent. New York Times Magazines Saul Austerlitz called poptimism a product of click-driven internet journalism that aspired to the lowest common denominator while being actively hostile to people who are fans of genres and bands associated with rockism. He further criticized it for allowing pop music fans to avoid expanding their taste and contrasted the types of music lauded by poptimists with the literature and film praised by book and film critics. Loss agreed with Austerlitz's text: [...] "When [...] wrote that '(m)usic criticism's former priority—telling consumers what to purchase—has been rendered null and void for most fans. In its stead, I believe, many critics have become cheerleaders for pop stars,' <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> an editor and a record label exec swooping down on him saying, [...] "Don't tell them that!" [...] We like to believe criticism is devoid of crass commercialism, but Austerlitz gives away that it never was in the first place." [...] He also noted a minuscule number of lowly-rated albums in publications such as Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, and PopMatters, and that [...] "telling consumers what to purchase is still the point of a lot of music 'criticism'." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} a new character {{created by the}} winner of the [...] "Best. Character. Ever." [...] contest, in which fans could submit their own ideas for a new, and possibly recurring, Simpsons character. Over 25,000 entries were sent in. The winner of the contest was Peggy Black from Orange, Connecticut, who created the character Ricardo Bomba. She described Ricardo as [...] "someone that all the women love and all the men want to be". Black's inspiration for the character came from {{the fact that there were}} no characters like him on The Simpsons, and she thought Springfield needed [...] "something like a Casanova". As part of the winning prize, Black was sent to work with the show's producers in Los Angeles. She worked with the animators to bring the character to life. In an interview with the Associated Press, Black stated she [...] "described the character and they drew him so I could see if that was my vision of him". She continued, [...] "It's amazing to see how they captured what <b>I</b> <b>imagined.</b> He's over the top." [...] Executive producer Al Jean was one of the judges of the contest, which he described as [...] "a thank you to loyal fans". Jean also noted that there is a possibility the Ricardo character might appear on the show again although this seems unlikely since the character appears to have been killed in a fiery car crash.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] were often {{difficult}} for listeners to decipher, both {{due to their}} nonsensicality and because of Cobain's slurred, guttural singing voice. This problem was {{compounded by the fact}} that the Nevermind album liner notes did not include any lyrics for the songs aside from selected lyrical fragments. This incomprehensibility contributed to the early resistance from radio stations towards adding the song to their playlists; one Geffen promoter recalled that people from rock radio told her, [...] "We can't play this. I can't understand what the guy is saying." [...] MTV went as far as to prepare a version of the video that included the lyrics running across the bottom of the screen, which they aired when the video was added to their heavy rotation schedule. The lyrics for the album—and some from earlier or alternate versions of the songs—were later released with the liner notes of the [...] "Lithium" [...] single in 1992. American rock critic Dave Marsh noted comments by disc jockeys of the time that the song was [...] "the 'Louie Louie' of the nineties" [...] and wrote, [...] "Like 'Louie,' only more so, 'Teen Spirit' reveals its secrets reluctantly and then often incoherently." [...] Marsh, trying to decipher the lyrics of the song, felt after reading the correct lyrics from the song's sheet music that [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> was quite a bit better (at least, more gratifying) than what Nirvana actually sang," [...] and added, [...] "Worst of all, I'm not sure that I know more about [...] 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' now than before I plunked down for the official version of the facts." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} film, remarking, [...] "It's clamorous, the save-the-world story is one everyone's seen time and again, and the characters {{have been around for}} more than half a century in 500 comic book issues. But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again." [...] To Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. [...] "It's also the blockbuster," [...] Travers said, [...] "I saw in my head when <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's Transformers with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor." [...] Justin Chang of Variety wrote, [...] "Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times complimented the film's frenetic pace, while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times commented that it [...] "provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable". Conversely, A. O. Scott of The New York Times believed that [...] "while The Avengers is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre." ...|$|E
