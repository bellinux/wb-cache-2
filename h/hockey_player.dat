40|$|Purpose. Motor {{coordination}} {{is proposed}} to {{be a relatively}} stable age-related construct, unlikely {{to be influenced by}} aligned experiential factors such as intensive sport-specific training. The purpose of the study is to investigate if there are differences in motor coordination abilities among young artistic gymnasts, swimmers, and ice <b>hockey</b> <b>players.</b> Methods. The participants of the study were 508 female and 258 male adolescents (age, M = 12. 80, SD = 1. 10) comprising artistic gymnasts (n = 463), swimmers (n = 70), and ice <b>hockey</b> <b>players</b> (n = 233). The KTK-test protocol was used to analyse their gross motor coordination abilities. Results. The results of the study demonstrated that gymnasts scored better than ice <b>hockey</b> <b>players</b> and swimmers in the test of walking backwards along a beam, and better than ice <b>hockey</b> <b>players</b> in total motor coordination, hopping over an obstacle, and the test of moving sideways on wooden boards. However, ice <b>hockey</b> <b>players</b> scored higher than swimmers and gymnasts in the test of jumping from side to side. Subsequently, swimmers obtained better results in the test of moving sideways on wooden boards as compared with ice <b>hockey</b> <b>players.</b> Conclusions. The study results indicate that intensive sport-specific training may extend young athletes’ motor coordination characteristics in the ability areas representative of the sport in which they engage...|$|R
