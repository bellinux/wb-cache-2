25|$|Given {{the limited}} budget and {{development}} time, only three chassis were ever made (larger teams, such as McLaren build {{as many as}} eight): one for each driver and a spare. The spare was used by Rubens Barrichello in Singapore, while Jenson Button used the second Brawn chassis BGP 001-02 in every practice, qualifying session and race between the 2009 Australian Grand Prix and the 2009 Brazilian Grand Prix. This meant that he won the championship in the oldest car on the grid. Chassis BGP 001-02 is owned by Ross Brawn and was demonstrated at the 2016 Goodwood Festival of Speed. Chassis 02 was painted silver after 2009 for the 2010 launch of Mercedes GP and used as a <b>demonstration</b> <b>car</b> for 2 years before being returned to its previous Brawn livery.|$|E

The Anacostia Line was permitted to use overhead lines, which are less expensive to install and maintain but which are prohibited within the historic city limits, because it is outside the old City of Washington.

50|$|Begun in 1943 and {{completed}} in 1947 after the war, the Type 73C {{was to be}} a comeback for Bugatti. But the death of Ettore Bugatti in August of that year doomed the project. An engine-less Type 73 was shown at the 1947 Paris Motor Show two months later. Although five 73C chassis had been constructed in Paris, Only one body was completed for these cars and at least three engines and one complete car were assembled and tested by the factory. Serge Pozzoli stated that he visited the Bugatti factory at Rue Debarcadere in Paris where he saw a <b>demonstration</b> <b>car</b> which was fitted with a scaled down body similar to the pre-war Type 50BIII (Cork Car). All the cars were dismantled and taken to Molsheim after Ettore Bugatti's death.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A new {{approach}} for vehicle tracking at urban intersections based on stereo-vision is proposed. Objects are represented as rigid 3 D point clouds and tracked {{by means of}} extended Kalman filtering. In this contribution we combine the advantages of a generic feature-based 3 D point cloud model with vehicle specific geometrical and kinematical constraints to estimate the pose and motion state of oncoming vehicles at intersections. Real-time dense stereo disparity maps provide new opportunities in reconstruction of the 3 D driving scene. An efficient and compact Stixel World representation is computed that segments the scene into drivable freespace and obstacles on the ground. Based on this data we derive the silhouette of an object in the image and constrain its pose in space during turning maneuvers. The system has been successfully tested on various real-world scenarios and runs in real-time on VGA images in our <b>demonstration</b> <b>car...</b>|$|E
