This paper investigates the appropriateness of <b>environmental</b> <b>technologies</b> for application at a cluster scale in IUWM.

25|$|Florida Institute of Technology's Jensen Beach Campus, {{also known}} as School of Marine and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Technology</b> or (SOMET), was a {{specialized}} branch campus located on the former campus of Saint Joseph College of Florida on the Indian River Lagoon in Jensen Beach, Florida, approximately 50 {{miles south of the}} university's main campus. The campus attracted oceanography, underwater technology and other assorted marine biology students. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had more officers that are graduates of FIT in Jensen Beach than from any other campus or college in the country. The SOMET was transferred to the main campus and became the Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences (DMES). The campus closed after the transition in 1986. In 2016, DMES was renamed Department of Ocean Engineering and Sciences (DOES) to communicate the department's focus.|$|E

40|$|Relevant {{advances}} in the mitigation of environmental impact could be obtained by the appropriate diffusion of existing <b>environmental</b> <b>technologies.</b> In this paper, {{we look at the}} diffusion of knowledge related to <b>environmental</b> <b>technologies</b> developed within the oil and gas industry. To assess knowledge spillovers from oil and gas inventions as a measure of technology diffusion, we rely on forward patent citations methodology. Results show that there is a strong likelihood that the citing patent will be eventually linked to <b>environmental</b> <b>technologies</b> if the original oil and gas invention has already environmental uses. Moreover, both intra and intersectoral spillovers produce a "turnabout" effect, meaning that citing patents show the opposite quality level of the cited patent. Our results support the idea that more sector-specific environmental policies, with an emphasis on diffusion, would significantly improve the use of <b>environmental</b> <b>technologies</b> developed within the oil and gas industry...|$|R

2500|$|Concern {{was raised}} {{over the air}} quality, and its {{potential}} effect on the athletes. Although the Beijing Municipal Government, in its bid file in 2001, committed to lowering air pollution, increasing environmental protection, and introducing <b>environmental</b> <b>technology,</b> research data show {{that even if the}} city were to dramatically cut down its emissions, pollution would still drift over from neighbouring provinces, upstream from which 50 percent of Beijing's air was believed to flow. Air pollution was at least two to three times higher than levels deemed safe by the World Health Organization. Marco Cardinale of the British Olympic Association has stated that air pollution coupled with heat and humidity makes it [...] "very unlikely we'll see outstanding performances in endurance sports." [...] Despite this, Beijing committed to remove 60,000 taxis and buses from the roads by the end of 2007 and relocate 200 local factories, including a prominent steel factory, before the games began. The Chinese government provided assurances that [...] "blue skies are a requirement not only for Beijing, but also for the places around it." [...] The United States Olympic Committee was confident that the air quality of Beijing would not be a concern for the US delegation to the games. Nevertheless, the IOC's medical commission analysed air-quality data recorded by the Beijing Environment Protection Bureau in August, when test athletic events were held in the Chinese capital. The commission found that outdoor endurance events—defined as those that include at least an hour of continuous, high-intensity physical effort—may pose some risk.|$|E
