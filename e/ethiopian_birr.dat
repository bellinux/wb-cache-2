The female flowers of hagenia contain anthelmintic, which is used to treat tapeworms among the local populations. St. John’s wort is used to combat depression.

The pulmonary lesions and diseases were diagnosed {{on the basis of}} pathological findings. Out of the 1, 148 slaughtered cattle examined, 990 (86. 2 %) had one or more lesions. The prevalence of pulmonary lesions in the slaughtered cattle varied among categories of the study variables. The most common lesions were congestion (38. 5 %), emphysema (36. 3 %), hydatidosis (18. 3 %), abscesses (7. 1 %) and verminous pneumonia (3. 2 %). The risk factors identified on statistical basis (p 7 years) and very lean cattle in pulmonary emphysema and pulmonary abscesses and young age (< 7 years) in verminous pneumonia. A total of 990 lungs (86. 2 %) were condemned or partially trimmed due to pulmonary lesions with an economic loss of 7, 920 <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>Birrs</b> (ET Birr). This loss was calculated from the mean retail local market price of cattle lung and the total number of lungs condemned during the study period. Annual economic lose due to lung condemnation, determined by considering annual slaughter rate of cattle and prevalence of lung lesions in the abattoir, was estimated to be 65, 000 ET Birr (US$) ...|$|R

The airport was opened at the cost of 182 million <b>birr.</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> Airlines serves the airport with destinations to Addis Ababa and Mek'ele.

30|$|Higher Learning Institutes in Ethiopia are {{producing}} {{an increasing number}} of graduates every year. However, the average duration of the unemployment period in urban Ethiopia was found to be more than 1  year (Serneels, 2004). The graduate oversupply has contributed to the imbalance of number of graduates in relation to the job opportunities available in the market. The government has come out with micro-credit loan schemes to help young and inexperienced graduates to start a business. For instance, the government approves 10 -billion <b>birr</b> (<b>Ethiopian</b> currency) revolving fund for Ethiopian youth in 2017 / 2018. The revolving fund was designed to provide financial assistance for youth to help them to employ their capabilities by creating jobs. This fund was administered by the commercial bank of Ethiopia (CBE) and paid to the youth via micro-financial institution for the purpose of job creation. The access to credit facilities helps to encourage the economic growth. Government of Ethiopia have initiated numerous interventions to encourage entrepreneurship; however, enough progress has not been made up to date. This {{can be attributed to the}} lack of understanding of the attitudes and perceptions among the youth towards entrepreneurship. These interventions mainly focus on dealing with the most common obstacles such as the financial support and regulation, while ignoring to foster the correct attitude towards entrepreneurship as a career choice.|$|R
25|$|Since the 1990s Ethiopia has {{experienced}} more increase {{of schools and}} colleges despite still not covering all regions. Millions of <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>birr</b> (ETB) continue {{to be spent on}} building educational institutions and many new schools have been constructed since Meles Zenawi took office. However, the government's focus on the agricultural sector has slowed the growth of jobs in the urban areas of Ethiopia, which is reflected in the anger of the urban population and its students as well as the landslide victory of opposition parties in these areas during the recent national election. Statistics showed that in 1991 only 27 percent of Ethiopian children attended school, but in 2004 gross enrollment rate was up to 77 percent and it reached 85 percent in November 2006.|$|E
2500|$|An {{inquiry into}} the {{violence}} found the property damage caused by the rioters and protesters in Addis Ababa and other cities totaled to 4.45 million <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>Birr,</b> including 190 damaged buses and 44 cars as police officers tried to restrain the rioters. The SBS journalist, Olivia Rousset, indicated that the government used too much force to subdue the rioters. She also said that [...] "stone-throwing rioters" [...] tried to take the guns from the security forces. Some EU observers have also shown their discontent at the post-election violence, suggesting that the police response was disproportionate, and blamed the government. In a rare response, Meles {{said that he was}} disappointed that [...] "some people have misunderstood the nature of the problem and misinterpreted it." [...] In its final report, the independent commission concluded that the aggressive steps taken by the police force were to [...] "avoid large scale violence and to protect the constitution" [...] and that the reason behind the riotings might have been the protestors' unfamiliarity with the [...] "process of democratization" [...] e.g., respecting election results. However, the commission also acknowledged that there were serious errors that needed to be addressed regarding the capabilities of the Ethiopian Security forces to control riots. However, three members of the Inquiry Commission have defected and given their testimonies to members of the U.S. Congress and the International Media. The former Supreme Court Judge of the Southern Ethiopian nations and nationalities, Judge Frehiwot Samuel, who was also Chairman of the Inquiry Commission, and his Deputy, Judge Wolde-Michael Meshesha, have fled Ethiopia with a video and final report of the Commission’s findings that shows the commission deciding, through an eight to two vote, that the government had used excessive force and that there were grave human rights violations. Some leaders, including the UK's Tony Blair, condemned the violence but repeated that Meles' ruling party [...] "won the election." [...] Other European organizations also praised the election saying it was a [...] "free and fair multi-party election." [...] So far, most of the US representatives have not changed their outlook and the US government supports the Ethiopian government in both military and aid assistance.

30|$|The {{livestock}} subsector has {{an enormous}} contribution to Ethiopia’s national economy and livelihoods of many Ethiopians. The subsector contributes about 16.5 % of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 35.6 % of the agricultural GDP. It also contributes 15 % of export earnings and 30 % of agricultural employment. The livestock subsector currently support and sustain livelihoods for 80 % of all rural population. The GDP of livestock related activities valued at 59 billion <b>birr.</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> livestock population trends, distribution and marketing vary considerably across space and time due {{to a variety of}} reasons. This study was aimed to assess cattle and shoat population growth trend, distribution and their access to market. Regression analysis was used to assess the cattle and shoat population growth trend and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques were used to determine the spatial distribution of cattle and shoats, and their relative access to market. The data sets used are agricultural census (2001 / 02) and annual CSA agricultural sample survey (1995 / 96 to 2012 / 13). In the past eighteen years, the livestock population namely cattle, sheep and goat grew from 54.5 million to over 103.5 million with average annual increment of 3.4 million. The current average national cattle, sheep and goat population per km 2 are estimated to be 71, 33 and 29 respectively (excluding Addis Ababa, Afar and Somali regions). From the total livestock population the country owns about 46 % cattle, 43 % sheep and 40 % goats are reared within 10  km radius from major livestock market centres and all-weather roads. On the other hand, three fourth of the country’s land mass which comprises 15 % of the cattle, 20 % of the sheep and 21 % of goat population is not accessible to market (greater than 30  km from major livestock market centres). It is found that the central highland regions account for the largest share of livestock population and also more accessible to market. Defining the spatial and temporal variations of livestock population is crucial in order to develop a sound and geographically targeted livestock development policy.|$|R

Ever since the Derg regime confiscated it, Kebede Michael’s house has gone through an unusual series of rebranding and remodeling efforts: since 1974, {{it has been used}} as an office of the local Derg rulers, then a prison for their inmates, a clinic, a bar, a billiard ball game center, and, as recently as 2012, the Menaheriya Hotel, Bar and Restaurant.
