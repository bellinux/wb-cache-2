40|$|Analyses of {{a series}} of {{published}} n-hexane hydroisomerization product slates suggest that MAZ-type zeolites yield more dimethylbutane and less methylpentane than either FAU- or MOR-type zeolites. Molecular simulations do not corroborate the traditional view that these selectivity differences are specifically related to the MAZ-, FAU-, or MOR- type zeolite topology. A scrutiny of the literature indicates that reported variation in selectivity relates to a variation in the efficiency of the (de) hydrogenation function relative to the acid function. The FAU-type zeolite catalyst had the most efficient hydrogenation function. The efficiency of the hydrogenation function on the MAZ-type zeolite was low enough to significantly enhance the 2, 3 -dimethylbutane yield relative to the methylpentane yield, but not low enough to decrease the 2, 2 -dimethylbutane yield. The efficiency of the hydrogenation function on the MOR-type zeolite was low enough to do both.

In the cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction, Ni addition promotes both benzene and methyl cyclopentane production. The <b>hydroconversion</b> activity (n-butane and n-octane) increases with the augment of total acidity produced by Ni. The selectivity to reaction products is modified according to the acid strength distribution changes produced by Ni addition...|$|E
40|$|SSCI-VIDE+ECI 2 D+LPIInternational audienceThe {{preferred}} chemisorption {{sites on}} a variety of palladium-iridium nanoalloys are determined for benzene and hydrogen molecules. Available sites {{on the surface of the}} nanoalloys are explored using a random-search method, directly at the density functional level of theory. These searches successfully reveal the site preference for benzene and significant nanosize effects in the chemisorption of hydrogen. It is hoped that through the study of the chemisorption properties of Pd-Ir nanoalloys, complex catalytic processes, such as tetralin <b>hydroconversion</b> and the preferential oxidation of CO, can be better understood.

40|$|International @ RAFFINAGE+TJA:CGE:MTFInternational audienceThe study {{concerns}} the <b>hydroconversion</b> kinetics of an atmospheric residue. Experimental {{data were obtained}} on a batch reactor {{as well as on}} a continuous micro-scale pilot unit. The residue was converted with a dispersed catalyst at 12 MPa of hydrogen for three temperatures ranging from 420 °C to 440 °C for contact or residence times of ranging from 30 min to 120 min. The feedstock was mixed with an oil-soluble precursor (molybdenum naphthenate) that generated in-situ the dispersed MoS 2 catalyst. The aims of the study were to develop a methodology to transpose a kinetic model developed on a batch reactor to a continuous reactor in order to predict the conversion and product yields as well as to gain knowledge on the effects of reactor configuration on the process performances. To this end, a simulator was built upon the kinetic model developed from batch reactor experiments and the hydrodynamic and mass transfer modeling of the micro-scale pilot unit: -Reaction scheme, rate constants, stoichiometric coefficients, vapor-liquid-equilibriums and average molecular weights were derived from batch experiments. Lumping technique based on distillation range fractions was utilized for the kinetic model. -Hydrodynamic behavior of the micro-scale pilot unit as well as its mass transfer characteristics were studied on a cold flow model. Simulated and experimental data obtained for the micro-scale pilot unit were compared in order to validate the methodology. The effects of the reactor configuration on the <b>hydroconversion</b> kinetics will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} of n-heptane, benzene, and toluene with HZSM 5 and Mo-HZSM 5 catalysts were studied by FTIR spectroscopy. The {{results from the}} FTIR study on the {{interactions of}} single molecules with these catalysts are compared with the product distribution results obtained during the <b>hydroconversion</b> of a model mixture of n-heptane-benzene-toluene over HZSM 5 -alumina and Mo-HZSM 5 -alumina catalysts. The FTIR study indicates that there are interactions of heptane, benzene, and toluene with both the strongly acidic internal OH's and the less acidic silanol groups in HZSM 5. These interactions {{seem to be a}} precursor for the formation of carbenium ions, which are the active species in <b>hydroconversion</b> reactions. The incorporation of Mo into HZSM 5 causes a strong {{decrease in the number of}} external silanols, suggesting that some of the impregnated Mo species are located at the external zeolite surface. It is also evident from the FTIR results that the incorporation of Mo does not entirely destroy or exchange the internal OH's of HZSM 5. The addition of Mo to the zeolite, in addition to causing a decrease in the overall conversion of heptane, causes a marked simplification in the pattern of the main reaction products. The cracking and alkylation functionalities of the catalyst are almost suppressed, whereas a significant increase in skeletal isomerization is observed. This suggests, in line with the FTIR experiments, that the incorporation of Mo into the HZSM 5 -alumina catalyst causes a decrease in the availability of the strong Bronsted acid sites located in the cavities of the zeolite...|$|E
