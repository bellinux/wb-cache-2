500|$|In {{his book}} The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959) Gardner {{states that he}} first heard the term Wica while being {{initiated}} into the New Forest coven in September 1939, stating that [...] "I realised I had stumbled on something interesting; but I was half-initiated before the word Wica which they used hit me like a thunderbolt, and I <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was, and that the Old Religion still existed." [...] This account was repeated in his biography, Gerald Gardner: Witch (1960), written by Idries Shah but attributed to Jack L. Bracelin, {{in which he is}} quoted as saying that [...] "it was halfway through when the word Wica was first mentioned; and I knew that that which I had thought burnt out hundreds of years ago still survived." [...] If Gardner's account was accurate and the New Forest coven had really existed, then the fact that Gardner spelled the word as Wica would not necessarily indicate that the coven members had spelled it the same way. As he relates, from Gardner's account, [...] "it seems that he had heard rather than read the word {{in the midst of his}} initiatory rite" [...] and that, [...] "suffering from a poor grasp of spelling, punctuation, and grammar, something caused by the fact that he was self-educated and possibly also influenced by dyslexia", he would have therefore spelled the word phonetically as Wica.|$|E

It seems impossible that voice is stilled which I have loved to hear for fifty years. Always I have felt I must have Mrs. Stanton's opinion of things before I <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> stood myself. I am all at sea..." ...|$|E

In other ways there has been the politics of selective quotation." [...] Rodden refers to the essay [...] "Why I Write", in which Orwell refers to the Spanish Civil War as being his [...] "watershed political experience", saying [...] "The Spanish War and other events in 1936–37, turned the scale. Thereafter I <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and for Democratic Socialism as I understand it." [...] (emphasis in original) Rodden goes on to explain how, during the McCarthy era, {{the introduction to the}} Signet edition of Animal Farm, which sold more than 20 million copies, makes use of [...] "the politics of ellipsis": ...|$|E
