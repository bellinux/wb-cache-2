5000|$|IPDS <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Printer</b> Data Stream. This is the {{bi-directional}} protocol used {{between the}} host server and the printer. It {{is used to}} send the page-level data to the printer and to signal errors and accounting information back to the server. The IPDS protocol also allows the server to query a printer's available resources (e.g. available memory, fonts, input trays, etc.). It is comparable to protocols like Internet Printing Protocol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Intelligent</b> <b>Printer</b> Data Stream (IPDS) is InfoPrint Solution Company's Systems Application Architecture host-to-printer {{data stream}} for Advanced Function Presentation subsystems. It {{provides}} an attachment-independent interface for controlling and managing all points addressable (APA) printers {{that allows the}} presentation of pages containing an architecturally unlimited mixture of different data types, including text, image, graphics, bar code, and object container. It is used {{by a variety of}} InfoPrint and OEM print servers that drive all points addressable (APA) page printers. Generally these printers are at the medium to high end of the print speed and volume spectrum.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the period}} of December 1982 to May 1983, a {{software}} prototype to support the IBM 4975 model 01 A printer was developed. The host computer was the IBM Series/ 1 minicomputer. The printer controller used was the Feature Programmable Multi-Line Adapter. Both the controller and printer contain one or more microprocessors that do some processing for the Series/ 1. With the RS 232 C electrical interface, the printer has remote capabilities. The electrical interface performs data transmission that is serial, asynchronous, and full duplex. This thesis serves as an application showing how <b>intelligent</b> <b>printers</b> and controllers can be utilized effectively on the Series/ 1...|$|R

Pinter controller and intelligent CRT development are discussed. The user's manual, design specifications for the MC 6809 version of the <b>intelligent</b> <b>printer</b> controller card, and a 132 -character by 64 -line intelligent CRT display system using a Motorola 6809 MPU, and a one-line assembler and disassembler are provided...|$|E
