5|$|The Agaonidae (fig wasps) are {{the only}} pollinators of nearly 1000 species of figs, and thus are crucial to the {{survival}} of their host plants. Since the wasps are equally dependent on their fig trees for survival, the coevolved relationship <b>is</b> <b>fully</b> mutualistic.|$|E
5|$|The female usually {{attaches}} the egg {{case to a}} substrate, inserts it into a suitably protective crevice, or {{carries it}} about until just before the eggs hatch. Some species, however, are ovoviviparous, keeping the eggs inside their body, with or without an egg case, until they hatch. At least one genus, Diploptera, <b>is</b> <b>fully</b> viviparous.|$|E

Visible patterns in nature are governed by physical laws; for example, meanders can be explained using fluid dynamics.|$|E

50|$|This concept {{occurs in}} the {{discussion}} of exoteric and esoteric religions.

Only through direct experience (eating an apple) can that experience <b>be</b> <b>fully</b> understood.|$|R
40|$|Sidney Shoemaker (1995) {{has given}} an {{influential}} {{explanation of the}} absurdity of Mooreparadoxical belief in terms of conscious belief. Here I offer a novel account of the absurdity of Moore-paradoxical assertion {{in terms of an}} interlocutor’s fully conscious beliefs. This account starts with an original argument for the principle that fully conscious belief collects over conjunction. The argument is premised on the synchronic unity of consciousness and the transparency of belief. 1. Fully conscious belief and transparency: fully conscious belief collects as well as distributes over conjunction It is plausible that your fully conscious beliefs—beliefs that you <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> aware of having— distribute over conjunction: (D) If you <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> conscious at t of believing that p and q, then you <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> conscious at t of believing that p and fully conscious at t of believing that q. For illustration, suppose that in bad weather, you <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> conscious that you believe both that it is wet and that it is cold. At the same time you <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> conscious that you believe that it is wet. And {{at the same time you}} <b>are</b> <b>fully</b> conscious that you believe that it is cold...|$|R

5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun <b>is</b> <b>fully</b> obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|According to the National Trust, {{the grass}} is trimmed {{regularly}} and the giant <b>is</b> <b>fully</b> re-chalked every 25 years. Traditionally, the National Trust has relied on sheep from surrounding farms to graze the site. However, in 2008 a lack of sheep, coupled with a wet spring causing extra plant growth, forced a re-chalking of the giant, with 17 tonnes of new chalk being poured in and tamped down by hand. In 2006, the National Trust carried out the first wildlife survey of the Cerne Abbas Giant, identifying wild flowers including the green-winged orchid, clustered bellflower and autumn gentian, which are uncommon in England.|$|E
