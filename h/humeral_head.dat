5|$|Similarities {{between the}} humerus of Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus northropi have been noted; {{both have a}} long, smooth deltopectoral crest, and a {{thickened}} <b>humeral</b> <b>head.</b> These were initially {{the basis of the}} taxon's referral to the clade Azhdarchidae, but they are also similar enough to be a basis for the synonymy of Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus. However, this is likely due to the relatively non-diagnostic nature of the humerus in giant azhdarchid taxonomy, and the lack of a detailed description for the elements of Q. northropi. However, the neck and jaw anatomy of Hatzegopteryx is quite clearly distinct from the smaller Q. sp., which warrants the retention of Hatzegopteryx as a taxon separate from Quetzalcoatlus.|$|E
5|$|According to Novas (1993), Herrerasaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features: {{the presence of a}} premaxilla-maxilla fenestra, and the dorsal part of laterotemporal fenestra is less than a third as wide as the ventral part; the presence of a ridge on the lateral surface of the jugal bone, and a deeply incised supratemporal fossa that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate ventral squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the quadratojugal bone overlaps the posterodorsal quadrate face; the pterygoid process of the quadrate has an inturned, trough-shaped ventral margin, and the presence of a slender ribbed posterodorsal dentary process; the surangular bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the humerus' internal tuberosity is proximally projected and separated from the <b>humeral</b> <b>head</b> by a deep groove (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% {{of the size of the}} humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the ilial peduncle forms a right angle with the dorsal border of the shaft on the ischium.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The histologic and histochemical {{features}} of quinolone-induced arthropathy were studied using 14 skeletally immature Beagle dogs (3 to 4 months old) dosed orally with difloxacin at 300 mg/kg body weight once daily for 1, 2, 5, or 7 days. A placebo {{was given to}} eight other age-matched Beagle dogs that served as controls. A scoring technique that included lesion size and histologic features {{was used to determine}} the progression of lesions. Articular-epiphyseal cartilage complexes on the femoral and <b>humeral</b> <b>heads</b> and tibia 1 tarsal bone were identified as predilection sites. Within predilection sites on femoral and <b>humeral</b> <b>heads,</b> lesions developed in specific areas. Lesions appeared within 2 days of the onset of treatment, and lesion scores increased with time. Grossly, the lesions were raised, fluid-filled vesicles on the articular surface. Histologic changes included vesicle formation with loss of proteoglycan, clumping of unmasked collagen, and degeneration and necrosis of chondrocytes. In lesions with higher scores, chondrocytes were often in clusters or they were undergo-ing metaplasia toward spindle-shaped cells. Although dissolution of matrix and necrosis of chondrocytes were typical of all lesions, smaller lesions had histologically normal chondrocytes adjacent to small vesicles. In sections stained with toluidine blue, proteoglycan was aggregated with collagen fibrils or was absent from the matrix adjacent to vesicles. Unique features, such as biomechanical forces, may predispose specific areas of articular cartilage to develop lesions...|$|R
25|$|The {{rotator cuff}} is an {{anatomical}} term {{given to the}} group of four muscles and their tendons that act to stabilize the shoulder. These muscles are the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis and that hold the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity during movement. The cuff adheres to the glenohumeral capsule and attaches {{to the head of the}} humerus. Together, these keep the <b>humeral</b> <b>head</b> in the glenoid cavity, preventing upward migration of the <b>humeral</b> <b>head</b> caused by the pull of the deltoid muscle at the beginning of arm elevation. The infraspinatus and the teres minor, along with the anterior fibers of the deltoid muscle, are responsible for external rotation of the arm.|$|E
25|$|The tendons of the rotator cuff, not the muscles, {{are most}} {{commonly}} involved, {{and of the}} four, the supraspinatus is most frequently affected, as it passes below the acromion. The role of the supraspinatus is to resist downward motion. The supraspinatus resists downward motion while the shoulder is relaxed as well as when carrying weight. Such a tear usually occurs at its point of insertion onto the <b>humeral</b> <b>head</b> at the greater tubercle. Even though the supraspinatus is the most commonly injured muscle of the four muscles in the rotator cuff, the other three muscles that comprise the rotator cuff, the infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis, may also be injured.|$|E
2500|$|X-ray projectional {{radiography}} cannot directly reveal {{tears of}} the rotator cuff, a 'soft tissue', and consequently, normal X-rays cannot exclude a damaged cuff. However, indirect evidence of pathology {{may be seen}} in instances where {{one or more of the}} tendons have undergone degenerative calcification (calcific tendinitis). The <b>humeral</b> <b>head</b> may migrate upwards (high-riding <b>humeral</b> <b>head)</b> secondary to tears of the infraspinatus, or combined tears of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Prolonged contact between a high-riding <b>humeral</b> <b>head</b> and the acromion above it, may lead to X-rays findings of wear on the <b>humeral</b> <b>head</b> and acromion and secondary degenerative arthritis of the glenohumeral joint (the ball and socket joint of the shoulder), called cuff arthropathy, may follow. Incidental X-ray [...] findings of bone spurs at the adjacent acromioclavicular joint may show a bone spur growing from the outer edge of the clavicle downwards towards the rotator cuff. Spurs may also be seen on the underside of the acromion, once thought to cause direct fraying of the rotator cuff from contact friction, a concept currently regarded as controversial.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Mineralization {{distribution}} of the subchondral bone plate {{can be used as}} a marker for long-term stress distribution in diarthrodial joints. Severe injuries or pathological changes of the glenohumeral joint often end in osteoarthritis, where shoulder arthroplasty has become the treatment of choice. The computed tomography osteoabsorptiometry (CT-OAM) is a non-invasive method to determine the {{distribution of}} the mineralization of the subchondral bone plate in vivo, which is an important factor concerning the implantation of orthopedic endoprostheses. The aim of this study was to investigate the mineralization of both joint partners of the glenohumeral joint and to compare them with each other. METHODS: The {{distribution of the}} mineralization of the subchondral bone plate of 57 shoulder specimens was determined by means of CT-OAM. To evaluate a correlation between age and localization of subchondral mineralization maxima, the Chi-square test correlation test was applied. RESULTS: Forty-nine glenoid cavities (86 %) showed a bicentric mineralization distribution pattern with anterior and posterior maxima, only 8 glenoid cavities (14 %) revealed a monocentric mineralization pattern with anterior maxima. Forty-five <b>humeral</b> <b>heads</b> (79 %) showed a bicentric distribution pattern with anterior and posterior maxima, 12 <b>humeral</b> <b>heads</b> (21 %) could be classified as monocentric with a centro-posterior pronounced maximum. CONCLUSIONS: We could demonstrate that stress distribution in both joint partners of the glenohumeral joint is inhomogeneous and characteristically bicentric due to the physiological incongruity. Monocentric mineralization patterns can result as a cause of age-related loss of incongruity...|$|R
40|$|Background: An {{investigation}} of matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) {{and its influence}} on vascular invasion in the secondary ossification center at the chondroepiphysis of developing long bones was undertaken. The effect of MMP- 9 was {{compared with that of}} basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), a potent angiogenic factor, and we assessed the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) culture as a model for angiogenesis in osteochondral tissue. Methods: Seventy-two femoral and seventy-two <b>humeral</b> <b>heads</b> of thirty-six four-day postnatal rabbits were dissected immediately after each animal was killed. Solutions of MMP- 9, b-FGF, and phosphate-buffered saline solution were ap-plied, and the femoral and humeral chondroepiphyseal explants were incubated for ten days in CAM culture. This was used as an in vivo model to investigate the growth of blood vessels into the femoral and <b>humeral</b> <b>heads</b> of the neona-tal rabbit. The explants were harvested from the CAM culture and analyzed histologically. A three-day incubation was also performed to look for early signs of vascular ingrowth into the cartilage matrix. Results: One hundred and twenty epiphyses from thirty rabbits were placed onto CAM culture successfully; of these, two were harvested at three days to assess early changes and 118 were harvested at ten days. Forty of the 118 cul-tures were still viable when harvested after ten days, giving a 33 % yield. Both MMP- 9 and b-FGF caused an increased vascular invasion into the chondroepiphysis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Large {{doses of}} {{cortisone}} {{were given to}} growing and adult rabbits over a five-month period to produce avascular necrosis of the femoral head. The cortisone caused {{an increase in the}} serum cholesterol, fatty metamorphosis of the liver, and fat emboli visible in sections of the femur and humerus.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} results of X-ray and CT scan for dysbaric osteonecrosis in Chinese divers. Methods: Both shoulders, hips and knees of 66 {{asymptomatic}} divers with diving duration {{of more than one}} year were examined by X-ray and CT scan. Results: The most frequent locations of dysbaric osteonecrosis were the upper femurs, followed by the upper humerus, lower femurs and upper tibias, and the most frequent radiographic lesions were calcification spots and cystic changes. Of the lesions detected, 38 % (27 / 71) and 42 % (95 / 229) were juxta-articular of the femoral and <b>humeral</b> <b>heads</b> by X-ray and CT respectively. The detection rates of dysbaric necrosis (juxta- and/or other lesions) of X-ray and CT scan were 42. 4 % (95 % confidence interval: 30. 5 %- 54. 3 %) and 81. 8 % (95 % CI: 72. 4 %- 91. 2 %) respectively (p< 0. 05). If CT scan was used as the gold standard, the sensitivity of X-ray was 100 % and the specificity was 31. 6 %. Conclusion: CT scan showed a higher detection rate of dysbaric necrosis than X-ray.

40|$|International audienceDysbaric osteonecrosis (DON) is an {{avascular}} bone necrosis seen in divers and compressed-air workers. It {{continues to}} be a significant occupational hazard that has important medical and social consequences for professional divers. The prevalence of DON varied between 0 % and 70. 6 % in professional divers in the literature. This paper seeks to describe the distribution of the lesions, the diagnosis and the prognosis of individuals affected by DON referred to a French occupational disease center. We led a retrospective study by searching for cases of DON in the medical files of divers seen in our occupational disease center between 2001 and 2014. 332 professional divers consulted in our center between 2001 and 2014.
