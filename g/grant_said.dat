5|$|General Robert E. Lee {{commanded}} the Army of Northern Virginia, while Major General John Brown Gordon commanded its Second Corps. Early {{in the morning}} of April 9, Gordon attacked, aiming to break through Federal lines at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, but failed, and the Confederate Army was then surrounded. At 8:30 A.M. that morning, Lee requested a meeting with Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant to discuss surrendering the Army of Northern Virginia. Shortly after twelve o'clock, Grant's reply reached Lee, and in it <b>Grant</b> <b>said</b> he would accept the surrender of the Confederate Army under certain conditions. Lee then rode into the little hamlet of Appomattox Court House, where the Appomattox county court house stood, and waited for Grant's arrival to surrender his army.|$|E
5|$|Stalwarts, led by Grant's old {{political}} ally, Roscoe Conkling, saw the ex-president's renewed popularity {{as a way}} {{for their}} faction to regain power, and sought to find ways to nominate him for the presidency in 1880. Opponents called it a violation of the unofficial two-term rule that had been the norm since George Washington. <b>Grant</b> <b>said</b> nothing publicly, but he wanted the job and encouraged his men. Washburne urged him to run; Grant demurred, saying he would be happy for the Republicans to win with another candidate, though he preferred James G. Blaine to John Sherman. Even so, Conkling and John A. Logan began to organize delegates in Grant's favor. When the convention convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate, but he was still short of a majority vote to capture the nomination.|$|E
25|$|Meade asked Grant for {{clarification}} because Grant had ordered a 4:00a.m. attack {{all along the}} line. <b>Grant</b> <b>said</b> both Humphreys and Parke should feel {{for a chance to}} push on that night, that Humphreys should send skirmishers forward and attack if the Confederates were leaving their positions. If the Confederates held their line, <b>Grant</b> <b>said</b> that Humphreys should send Miles's division down White Oak Road to reinforce Sheridan. Grant also directed that Wright, Parke and Ord, with John Gibbon's XXIV Corps from the Army of the James, should begin an artillery barrage on the Confederate lines. The corps commanders and Ord reported their men could not see well enough to attack. At 10:00p.m., Union artillery opened fire on the Confederate lines opposite the Petersburg lines until 2:00a.m. The Confederates did not leave the lines and the Union assault began at about4:40a.m.|$|E

500|$|Promoted to captain on August 5, 1853, Grant was {{assigned}} to command Company F, 4th Infantry, at the newly constructed Fort Humboldt in California. He arrived at the fort on January 5, 1854, and reported to its commander Lieutenant Colonel Robert C. Buchanan. Grant was bored and depressed about being separated from his wife Julia, {{and he began to}} drink. An officer who roomed with <b>Grant</b> <b>said</b> he [...] "fell too much under the influence of liquor to properly perform his duties. Colonel Buchanan demanded he should resign." [...] Historian Jean Edward Smith says, [...] "The story rings true." [...] When Grant was reprimanded by Buchanan for one drinking episode, Grant told Buchanan if he did not reform he would resign. One Sunday, Grant was rumored to have been found at his company's paytable influenced by drink. Keeping his pledge to Buchanan, Grant resigned, effective July 31, 1854, without explanation. Buchanan endorsed Grant's letter of resignation but did not submit any report that verified the incident. Grant was neither arrested nor faced court-martial, while the War Department stated, [...] "Nothing stands against his good name." [...] <b>Grant</b> <b>said</b> years later, [...] "the vice of intemperance (drunkenness) had not a little to do with my decision to resign." [...] With no means of support, Grant returned to St. Louis and reunited with his family, uncertain about his future.|$|E

Many Republicans felt that with the amendment's passage, black Americans no longer needed federal protection; congressman and future president James A.

500|$|Hamilton Fish (August 3, 1808September 7, 1893), was an American statesman {{who served}} as the 16th Governor of New York, a United States Senator and United States Secretary of State. Fish is {{recognized}} as the [...] "pillar" [...] of the Grant Administration and considered one of the best U.S. Secretaries of State by scholars, known for his judiciousness and efforts towards reform and diplomatic moderation. [...] Fish settled the controversial Alabama Claims with Great Britain through his development of the concept of international arbitration. Fish kept the United States out of war with Spain over Cuban independence by coolly handling the volatile Virginius Incident. [...] In 1875, Fish initiated the process that would ultimately lead to Hawaiian statehood, by having negotiated a reciprocal trade treaty for the island nation's sugar production. [...] He also organized a peace conference and treaty in Washington D.C. between South American countries and Spain. Fish worked with James Milton Turner, America's first African American consul, to settle the Liberian-Grebo war. President <b>Grant</b> <b>said</b> he trusted Fish the most for political advice.|$|E

500|$|When Grant {{took office}} in 1869, the nation's policy towards Indians was in chaos, with more than 250,000 Indians being governed by 370 treaties. Grant promised in his inaugural address to work toward [...] "the proper {{treatment}} of the original occupants of this land—the Indians." [...] He appointed Ely S. Parker, a Seneca Indian, {{a member of his}} wartime staff, as Commissioner of Indian Affairs, the first Native American to serve in this position. With his familiarity of Indian life, Parker became the chief architect of Grant's Peace Policy. In April 1869, Grant signed a law establishing a Board of Indian Commissioners to oversee spending and reduce corruption in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1871, he signed a bill ending the Indian treaty system; the law now treated individual Native Americans as wards of the federal government, and no longer dealt with the tribes as sovereign entities. Grant believed that Indians, given opportunities for education and work, could serve alongside white men. His Peace Policy aimed to replace entrepreneurs serving as Indian agents with missionaries and aimed to protect Indians on reservations and educate them in farming. [...] "My efforts in the future will be directed," [...] <b>Grant</b> <b>said</b> in his second inaugural address, [...] "by a humane course, to bring the aborigines of the country under the benign influences of education and civilization... Wars of extermination... are demoralizing and wicked." ...|$|E
500|$|Grant has {{predominantly}} been {{a comedy}} (especially a romantic comedy) actor {{for almost all}} of his mainstream film career.

[...] A majority of Grant's popular films in the 1990s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love, often with an American woman. In earlier films, Grant was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed Englishman for humorous effects, allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously. These performances were sometimes deemed overbearing, {{in the words of}} Washington Posts Rita Kempley, due to his [...] "comic overreactions—the mugging, the stuttering, the fluttering eyelids." [...] She added: [...] "He's got more tics than Benny Hill." [...] Grant's penchant for conveying his characters' feelings with mannerisms, rather than direct emotions, {{has been one of the}} foremost objections raised against his acting style. Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post once stated that, to be effective as a comic performer, he must get [...] "his jiving and shucking under control." [...] Film historian David Thomson wrote in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film about how it is merely [...] "itchy mannerisms" [...] that Grant equates with screen acting.

500|$|The album saw {{the band}} take on {{much more of}} a commercially {{influenced}} sound, and also the appearance of Moog synthesizers, while being lyrically focused on a comedic approach, as with [...] "Seven Days in the Sun", but also dark emotions, such as those shown on [...] "Turn", [...] "Oxygen", and [...] "Satellite News". It was during the campaign for Echo Park that the band played another slot on the main stage at the Reading and Leeds festival, including T in the Park. As of August 2003, the album has shipped 300,000 units in the UK going platinum, with counter sales standing at 293,000 as of February 2005. <b>Grant</b> <b>said</b> in a Melody Maker interview that if the album did not sell well enough the band would probably split up; he said at the time that [...] "It's the same with any band. That's just the way the music business is. There is only {{a certain amount of money}} a label will put into a band. I'm just being realistic.
