5|$|Flight testing {{began with}} the first flight of the second AH-56 (s/n 66-8827) in September 1967. During early flight tests, a rotor {{instability}} issue was discovered when the aircraft was flying at low altitude in <b>ground</b> <b>effect.</b> As the flight envelope was expanded, this instability and other minor problems were discovered and quickly addressed.|$|E
5|$|Murray had {{designed}} {{a car for}} the 1979 season called the BT47 that had a Chaparral 2J-type box rear end with twin variable geometry fans on the rear to maximize <b>ground</b> <b>effect.</b> The car was never built due to the FIA closing the loophole in the regulations for the 1979 season.|$|E
5|$|Andretti {{found little}} success after 1978 in Formula Oneâ€“ {{he failed to}} win another grand prix. He had a {{difficult}} year in 1979, as the new Lotus 80 was not competitive, and the team {{had to rely on}} the Lotus 79 which had been overtaken by the second generation of <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> cars. In 1980, he was paired with the young Italian Elio de Angelis, and briefly with test driver Nigel Mansell, but the team was again unsuccessful.|$|E
40|$|Aerodynamic {{characteristics}} of an aircraft may significantly differ when flying {{close to the}} ground rather than when flying up and away. Recent research has also determined that dynamic effects (i. e., sink rate) influence <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> (GE). A <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> flight test program of the F- 15 aircraft was conducted to support the propulsion controlled aircraft (PCA) program at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. Flight data was collected for 24 landings on seven test flights. Dynamic <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> data were obtained for low- and high-sink rates, between 0. 8 and 6. 5 ft/sec, at two approach speed and flap combinations. These combinations consisted of 150 kt with the flaps down (30 deg deflection) and 170 kt with the flaps up (0 deg deflection), both with the inlet ramps in the full-up position. The aerodynamic coefficients caused by <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> were estimated from the flight data. These <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> data were correlated with the aircraft speed, flap setting, and sink rate. Results are compared to previous flight test and wind-tunnel <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> data for various wings and for complete aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} of <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> on aerodynamic characteristics have been {{stimulated by the}} interest in powered-lift STOL airplanes. The <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> on upper-surface-blowing (USB) configurations may involve change in both the circulation forces and the jet reaction forces. In this note, a theoretical method is proposed for predicting these effects. It is shown that the predicted results agree well with available experimental data. In particular, the wing-alone method is shown to be incapable of predicting the <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> of USB configurations...|$|R
50|$|By mid-1982 the car {{was built}} with full <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> {{aerodynamics}} and was ready for testing. The car proved quick in testing and the engine was as strong as expected, but the suspension was proving suspect, breaking numerous times under the heavy load generated by the <b>ground</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the <b>ground</b> <b>effect.</b> An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E
5|$|From 1978, Ecclestone was {{president}} of the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA), a body formed by the teams to represent their interests. This left his team open to accusations of having advance warning of rule changes. Ecclestone denies that the team benefited from this and Murray has noted that, contrary to this view, at the end of 1982 the team had to abandon their new BT51 car, built on the basis that <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> would be permitted in 1983. Brabham had to design and build a replacement, the BT52, in only three months. At the end of the 1983 season, Renault and Ferrari, both beaten to the Drivers' Championship by Piquet, protested that the Research Octane Number (RON) of the team's fuel was above the legal limit of 102. The FIA declared that a figure of up to 102.9 was permitted under the rules, and that Brabham had not exceeded this limit.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> tunnels under the cars.|$|E

5|$|The Victor was {{commonly}} {{described as}} having good handling and excellent performance, along with favourable low speed flight characteristics. During the flight tests of the first prototype, the Victor proved its aerodynamic performance, flying up to Mach 0.98 without handling or buffeting problems; there were next to no aerodynamic changes between prototype and production aircraft. Production aircraft featured an automated nose-flap operation to counteract a tendency for the aircraft to pitch upwards during low-to-moderate Mach numbers. At low altitude, the Victor typically flew in a smooth and comfortable manner, {{in part due to}} its narrowness and flexibility of the crescent wing. One unusual flight characteristic of the early Victor was its self-landing capability; once lined up with the runway, the aircraft would naturally flare as the wing entered into <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> while the tail continued to sink, giving a cushioned landing without any command or intervention by the pilot.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} process had involved {{extensive use of}} physical models; for one series of blowing trials, mixtures of focused hot and cold air were directed onto ground platforms to simulate the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> upon take-off. This work {{was considered to be}} critical to the project as there was very little knowledge of the adverse effects which could influence the aircraft during the vertical takeoff process; as there was no airflow over the ailerons, tailplane, and rudder while the aircraft was held in a stationary hover, wingtip control jets were experimented with as an alternative reaction control approach. These research included the development of an all-new control response simulator which linked a series of simple flying controls to a computer. By the end of 1958, barely eighteen months after the start of the project, all the main features of the P.1127 were developed with one exception, that being the reaction control system, the development of which was completed by April 1959.|$|E
5|$|The team {{used the}} BT49 over four seasons. In the 1980 season Piquet scored three wins {{and the team}} took third in the Constructors' Championship with Piquet second in the Drivers' Championship. This season saw the {{introduction}} of the blue and white livery that the cars would wear through several changes of sponsor, until the team's demise in 1992. With a better understanding of <b>ground</b> <b>effect,</b> the team further developed the BT49C for the 1981 season, incorporating a hydropneumatic suspension system to avoid ride height limitations intended to reduce downforce. Piquet, who had developed a close working relationship with Murray, took the drivers' title with three wins, albeit amid accusations of cheating. The team finished second in the Constructors' Championship, behind the Williams team.|$|E

5|$|Within its range, the blackmouth {{catshark}} {{is one of}} the most abundant sharks over the upper and middle continental slope. It is nomadic in nature and may be found alone or in groups. Relatively slow, this shark swims with strong eel-like (anguilliform) undulations of its body. It often cruises just above the sea floor, perhaps taking advantage of the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> (a reduction in the drag on a wing when close to the ground) to save energy. It has also been seen resting motionless on the bottom. Known predators of the {{blackmouth catshark}} include the kitefin shark (Dalatias licha) and the European flying squid (Todarodes sagittatus). Parasites that have been documented from this species include the tapeworm Ditrachybothridium macrocephalum and the protist Eimeria palavensis.|$|E
5|$|Snake {{continues}} his mission, destroying the facility and the Shagohod tank, while engaging Volgin, who is {{killed by a}} bolt of lightning during the battle. Snake and EVA travel to a lake, where a WIG <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> vehicle is hidden. Before they use it to escape the region, Snake confronts his old mentor, The Boss, whom he must assassinate to complete his mission. After an emotional battle, The Boss gives Snake the microfilm containing the location of the Philosopher's Legacy, and requests Snake to kill her. Soon after, Snake overcomes his feelings and kills The Boss, emerging victorious. He and EVA escape to Alaska, and spend the night together as they make love. During the night, EVA disappears with the microfilm, and leaves behind a tape revealing herself to be a Chinese spy sent to steal the Philosopher's Legacy for China. The tape continues, and EVA reveals that The Boss did not defect to the Soviet Union; rather, she was under orders to pretend to defect so she could infiltrate Volgin's ranks and find the location of the Legacy, which could be brought back to America. The final part of her mission was to sacrifice her honor and die at the hands of Snake, under the guise of a traitor, to prove the U.S.'s innocence in Volgin's nuclear attack during the Virtuous Mission.|$|E
25|$|The new {{technologies}} introduced by Renault and Lotus became {{entangled in the}} FISA-FOCA war of the early 1980s. Turbo engines were complex machines whose layout limited the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> 'tunnels' under the car. They were an emerging technology {{and so they were}} difficult and expensive to develop and build and make reliable. It was mostly manufacturer-supported teams, such as Renault, Ferrari and Alfa Romeo which took that route. In contrast, the cheap, reliable and narrow Ford-Cosworth DFV engine, still used by most teams more than a decade after its introduction, lent itself well to highly efficient <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> aerodynamics. These two groups were represented by two political bodies â€“ the sport's governing body FISA, headed by Jean-Marie Balestre; and FOCA, headed up by Bernie Ecclestone. The first group supported a strict limitation of <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> to gain full advantage from their powerful turbos while the other relied on unrestricted <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> to balance their horsepower deficit. There were also financial considerations. Faced with large constructors with unrestricted budgets, the smaller constructors wanted a larger share of Formula One's income to remain competitive.|$|E

40|$|A unified {{method is}} {{recommended}} for predicting <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> on noise. This method {{may be used in}} flyover noise predictions and in correcting static test-stand data to free-field conditions. The recommendation is based on a review of recent progress in the theory of <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> and of the experimental evidence which supports this theory. It is shown that a surface wave must be included sometimes in the prediction method. Prediction equations are collected conveniently in a single section of the paper. Methods of measuring ground impedance and the resulting ground-impedance data are also reviewed because the recommended method is based on a locally reactive impedance boundary model. Current practice of estimating <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> are reviewed and consideration is given to practical problems in applying the recommended method. These problems include finite frequency-band filters, finite source dimension, wind and temperature gradients, and signal incoherence...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>effects</b> on {{noise from}} a {{high-bypass}} ratio engined aircraft are investigated. A 747 is flown at altitudes from 30 to 960 m past a 20 -microphone array, and <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> are calculated from noise measurements {{as a function}} of elevation angle and slant range. Results are given in terms of EPNL units and are compared with previous results of a turbojet-powered T- 38 and SAE-recommended empirical lateral attenuation prediction procedures. Theoretical predictions are made based on a method developed by Pao et al. (1978) and are compared with both 747 and T- 38 results, demonstrating good agreement although a consistent underprediction of peak measured attenuation is observed. Measured <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> are found largest at 200 Hz, and no definite shielding differences are apparent for a directivity angle of 122. 5 deg. Less lateral attenuation of effective perceived noise is measured for both aircraft and is attributed to the dominance of low-frequency noise in the source spectrum...|$|R
