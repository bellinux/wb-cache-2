40|$|Abstract: In {{the late}} 1970 's, when {{competition}} {{was introduced in}} the United States, competitive forces pushed international telephone prices down. Lower prices resulted, inter alia, in an increase in international calls (and minutes) from the U. S. to countries whose prices were high relative to U. S. prices. This increase in minute volume in turn resulted in a significant increase in settlement payments out-flow from the U. S. The U. S. is not the only country to experience settlement deficit. Several other countries, including Sweden, Australia and Japan, have growing deficits on settlement payments. Three issues are involved in Settlements: The “correctness ” of the procedure from the perspective of: • Public policy Balance of payments and The operating companies. The effects of call-back and/or resale business on the settlement process are addressed. The paper, then, examines alternative settlement policies: first-best pricing, bill-and-keep, benchmark and cost-based pricing. The modelling demonstrates that: a) call-back does not necessarily <b>force</b> lower <b>accounting</b> <b>rates</b> on monopoly carriers, indeed, call-back can exacerbate the settlement problem; b) cost-based pricing is the preferred approach to settlements; c) billand-keep and the fifty-fifty split of the <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> are both inappropriate on efficiency grounds; and d) settlements rates are set at monopoly prices under certain market structures...|$|R
40|$|International {{telecommunication}} carriers negotiate operating agreements for routing {{traffic and}} dividing toll revenues. They also establish an <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> to compensate {{each other for}} accepting calls and delivering them to the intended recipient. <b>Accounting</b> <b>rates</b> have failed to drop commensurate with lower unit costs incurred by service providers, and have motivated customers and carriers alike to devise ways to route exempt traffic. Artificially high <b>accounting</b> <b>rates</b> exacerbate the impact of significantly higher outbound US international traffic volumes. In 1991 the <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> settlement process resulted in the payment of over $ 3. 4 billion by US carriers to their foreign counterparts in both developed and developing nations.

The developing world nevertheless runs the risk of being unfairly caught in the cost-based crossfire.

Using data for international calls between the US and 148 foreign destinations between 1991 and 1997, this paper finds that the increasing payment deficit for the US is associated with decreasing <b>accounting</b> <b>rates.</b> In other words, the international revenue settlement is related more to imbalances in telephone traffic than to <b>accounting</b> <b>rates.</b> The econometric model shows that growing asymmetries in teledensity, market concentration, and income levels between the US {{and the rest of}} the world explain the imbalances.

40|$|Twenty European {{countries}} {{came together}} in 1865 to form an organisation, the predecessor to the International Telecommunications Union and to arrive at mechanisms and agree upon a methodology of distributing the revenues from the international telegraph service. The current <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> system is {{a modified version of}} the then developed methodology for the International telegraph. This international settlement regime based on <b>accounting</b> <b>rates</b> has long been under attack by economists, policy-makers in developed countries and international trade organisations. The ITU, the OECD, the FCC and other regulatory bodies are pursuing various initiatives to reform or replace the existing <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> system. These regulatory initiatives are aimed at reducing the current pricing distortions embedded in the <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> system. In the wake of the WTO agreement, a system of traffic compensation that is not ‘cost oriented’ is not only unsustainable, it is also in violation of the regulatory principles set out in the WTO reference paper. The FCC has been at the forefront of the move to decrease <b>accounting</b> <b>rates.</b> In August 1997, the FCC adopted “benchmark” <b>accounting</b> <b>rates</b> for different groups of countries, which it considered more closely related to the actual costs of providing international service between those countries and the US. The benchmark rates range from $ 0. 15 -$. 23 per minute, and are far below those currently in practice, particularly for most of the developing countries which are sometimes in excess of $ 1. 00 per minute. If implemented, these rates would significantly reduce international calling revenues of these countries. While the FCC obviously has no direct regulatory jurisdiction outside of the US, it has threatened to deny access to the US market to PTOs from other countries that do not reduce their <b>accounting</b> <b>rates</b> to the benchmark levels. While the future of the existing <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> system is being debated in regulatory circles, an increasing proportion of international traffic is bypassing this traditional system of compensation. Facilitated by the global trend towards the liberalisation of telecommunications markets, new technological means for bypassing the <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> system are also developing rapidly. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> system {{currently}} in place {{is used to}} reimburse telephone companies {{around the world for}} terminating calls originating in foreign countries. Increased competition in more liberalized countries has led to imbalances between traffic originating in these countries and traffic coming in from less liberalized countries, leading to huge settlement payments being made to less liberalized countries. Some variation in <b>accounting</b> <b>rates</b> across countries can be explained by traditional factors such as the actual cost of terminating calls. Our results suggest that <b>accounting</b> <b>rates</b> are also significantly affected by non-traditional factors such as the extent of government regulation, the level of corruption, and the like.

40|$|The revenue {{settlement}} {{process in}} international telecommunications, {{that is used}} by the majority of carriers, is the accounting revenue division procedure (ARDP). The formula for the net-settlement which is central to revenue settlement, is a model of simplicity. However, it is often ignored that the process is based on equal sharing of the accounting revenue, between two carriers who are exchanging international telephone traffic between their respective countries. In particular, the provision of equal sharing of the accounting revenue is not compatible with a competitive global market. A further crucial element of the settlement process is the so-called <b>accounting</b> <b>rate.</b> The net-settlement is linearly dependent on the <b>accounting</b> <b>rate,</b> but changes in the level of the <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> cannot eliminate the provision of equal revenue sharing. In fact, the proclaimed aim of reducing <b>accounting</b> <b>rates</b> toward cost, {{while at the same time}} preserving the provision for equal sharing of the accounting revenue, will most certainly lead to a subsidy from lesser developed countries to developed countries, regardless of the volume of telephone traffic exchanged, even if the payer of the net-settlement is the carrier of the developed country. On the other hand, removal of the provision of equal sharing of the accounting revenue from the ARDP would obliterate the entire process, and with it the opportunity offered to both carriers to simultaneously earn settlement revenues beyond the revenue requirement.

40|$|Several {{national}} governments {{have expressed concern}} at the inability of carriers to negotiate lower <b>accounting</b> <b>rates.</b> Ergas and Patterson (1991) and Frieden (1997) {{argue that it is}} only on bilateral markets with facilities-based competition at both ends that conditions favour <b>accounting</b> <b>rates</b> reductions. In the absence of facilities-based competition, Frieden also suggests that service providers, such as resellers, may provide a second best opportunity to place downward pressure on <b>accounting</b> <b>rates.</b> This study extends the work of Ergas and Patterson by developing an econometric model of settlement rate pricing. The model is estimated on data for 27 US bilateral telephone markets for the period 1985 to 1995. Parameter estimates are used to identify settlement rate determinants, and so highlight impediments to efficient international telecommunications pricing. A novel feature of the model is the inclusion of a resale market structure variable. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we build a simple three-country model to {{evaluate}} the impact of "call-back" on international telephony. The effects on both <b>accounting</b> <b>rates</b> and collection prices are studied. Call-back firms exploit arbitrage opportunities in collection prices among countries, rerouteing calls that originate in countries with high prices for international phone calls via countries with low prices. Contrary {{to what it is}} commonly perceived, we show that call-back tends to magnify the distortions associated with the current <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> regime. In particular call-back puts upward pressure both on low price countries foreign <b>accounting</b> <b>rates</b> and collection charges. Call-back companies are assumed to enjoy a price discount on each rerouted call; we show that the larger the price discount offered to call-back companies, the higher the prices for international calls in the country hosting call-back. telecommunications; call-back; access; accounting rate; collection charge; international telephony. ...|$|R

40|$|Accounting {{measures}} are traditionally considered not significant {{from an economic}} point of view. In particular, <b>accounting</b> <b>rates</b> of return are often regarded economically meaningless or, at the very best, poor surrogates for the IRR, which is held to be “the” economic yield. Likewise, residual income does not enjoy, in general, periodic consistency with the project NPV, so residual income maximization is not equivalent to NPV maximization. This paper shows that the opposition accounting/economic is artificial and, taking a capital budgeting perspective, illustrates the strong (formal and conceptual) connections existing between economic measures and accounting measures. In particular, the average <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> of return is the correct economic yield of a project; the traditional IRR is (whenever it exists) only a particular case of it. The average <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> generates a decision rule which is logically equivalent to the NPV rule for both accept/reject decisions and project ranking. The paper also shows that maximization of the simple arithmetic mean of residual incomes is equivalent to NPV maximization, owing to its periodic consistency {{in the sense of}} Egginton (1995). Such an index may then be used for incentive compensation as well. Moreover, asset pricing may be interpreted in accounting terms as the process whereby the market determines the income impact on the assets’ value. As a result, the paper harmonizes the notions of <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> of return, internal rate of return, residual income, net present value: they are just different ways of cognizing the same notion. This conciliation stems in a rather natural way from three sources: (i) a fundamental accounting identity, which links income and cash flow in a comprehensive way, (ii) the definition of Chisini mean, (iii) a notion of residual income which takes account of the “real” (comprehensive) cost of capital.
