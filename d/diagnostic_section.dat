50|$|Meyer had {{to teach}} {{pathology}} and comparative pathology at the Veterinary School of Pennsylvania. He soon got into arguments with the Dean over his rough dealing with ill prepared students - criticism that was fell founded, however. Then, the faculty promoted Meyer to full professor, {{and put him in}} charge of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>section</b> of the Laboratory and Experimental Farm, Pennsylvania Livestock Sanitary Board. - There, he worked on glanders, a bacterial disease in horses, mules, etc. which first affects the mucous membranes. It may be lethal, and is also dangerous to humans. - He also helped elucidating the transmission of the bacteria causing a contagious abortion disease of cattle and also infecting humans via unsterilized milk, causing (possibly lethal) fever. This is the so-called brucellosis, a disease Meyer continued working on later. - Meyer never just stayed in the laboratory. He wanted to put his expertise to practical use, to the benefit of the people. So he soon consulted with the Milk Commission working on regulation to secure milk quality.|$|E

40|$|The Project X Injector Experiment (PXIE) {{will serve}} as a {{prototype}} for the Project X front end. The aim is to validate the Project-X design and to decrease technical risks, known to be mainly related to the front end. PXIE will accelerate a 1 mA CW beam to about 25 MeV. It will consist of an ion source, LEBT, CW RFQ, MEBT, two SC cryomodules, a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>section</b> and a beam dump. A bunch-by-bunch chopper located in the MEBT section will allow formation of an arbitrary bunch structure. PXIE deviates somewhat from the current Project-X front end concept in that it provides additional instrumentation and relies on a reduced number of kickers for bunch chopping; the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>section</b> also include an RF separator to allow studying extinction of removed bunches.
