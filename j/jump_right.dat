25|$|<b>Jump</b> <b>Right</b> In is an {{instrumental}} methods book with accompanying teacher editions that applies Gordon's music learning theory, co-written by Eastman School of Music music education faculty Richard F. Grunow and Christopher D Azzara alongside Gordon. The series for Winds and Percussion {{was first published}} in 1989–90, three years after the recorder edition. The collection also includes a strings methods edition.|$|E
25|$|Instant Action mode {{allows the}} players to <b>jump</b> <b>right</b> into a battle of their choice. The player can also {{customize}} a list of battles, which then can be played through in the order they have chosen, or in a random order. Players can choose between playing as the Republic, the CIS, the Empire, or the Rebels {{on each of the}} maps, except Kamino, Geonosis, Endor and Hoth, which do not allow the player to select their battle era, as these follow their canonical settings. Players can also choose whether or not they would like to have heroes fight for each side.|$|E
25|$|When he returned, however, Cook - now bowling at {{a slower}} pace than in 1911 - {{immediately}} became, for the first time, indispensable to Lancashire. Although he still failed to achieve much against strong counties, he did a notable performance against Gloucestershire with nine for 49, and was second in the Lancashire bowling averages. 1920, however, saw Cook <b>jump</b> <b>right</b> {{to the top of the}} tree with 156 first-class wickets for less than fifteen runs each, and some notable performances in tandem with Harry Dean and Cecil Parkin, notably against Kent at Old Trafford in July. Although he did not have the honour of representing the Players or touring Australia, Cook would no doubt have been chosen as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden but for the special portrait of Pelham Warner to commemorate Middlesex's Championship win. In the dry summer of 1921, Cook showed himself to be one of the most tireless and consistent workhorses in county cricket, even if no selector thought he had enough sting to be a Test match bowler. He took 151 wickets without one haul of seven in an innings, and in 1922 he maintained his accuracy and spin notably when taking seven for 23 on a crumbling pitch.|$|E

500|$|Another {{modification}} in Vikersund (this time to K200) {{resulted in}} the coveted 250m barrier being reached in 2015, with Peter Prevc landing a clean <b>jump</b> <b>right</b> on the mark to claim another historic milestone in the sport. Prevc's triumph was short-lived when Anders Fannemel broke this figure only a day later, landing a jump of [...] At the same event, prior to Fannemel's jump, Dmitry Vassiliev crashed hard onto near-flat ground at [...] {{in a similar way}} to Janne Ahonen in Planica a decade earlier; this nonetheless gave Vassiliev unofficially the furthest distance ever reached in ski flying to date.|$|E
500|$|Silver himself {{commented that}} {{inspiration}} came from multiple sources: [...] "I'm inspired by nature and {{by some of}} the people I meet and some of the events that take place in my life. I'm inspired by my mentors. I'm inspired by various religious doctrines. [...] Many of my songs are impressed on my mind just before I wake up. Others I get from just doodlin' around on the piano". He also wrote that, [...] "when I wake up with a melody in my head, I <b>jump</b> <b>right</b> out of bed before I forget it and run to the piano and my tape recorder. I play the melody with my right hand and then harmonize it with my left. I put it down on my tape recorder, and then I work on getting a bridge or eightbar release for the tune." ...|$|E

Whatever it's called, I dig it." [...] and GameSpot wrote that [...] "fundamentals of the Age of Empires II engine are so intact in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds that veterans of that game can <b>jump</b> <b>right</b> in." [...] In October 2005, Shelley commented on the impact of the series. In a GameSpy interview, he explained that parents would [...] "tell Ensemble Studios that their kid is reading books about ancient Greece because they enjoy playing with the triremes so much, or that they want to check out books about medieval history because [...] game taught them what a trebuchet was." ...|$|E

He is currently signed to 604 Records/Universal Music Canada and released his solo debut country album, <b>Jumped</b> <b>Right</b> In, on May 22, 2012.

500|$|Despite {{previous}} {{guest actor}} Leonard Nimoy's recent retirement, the writers still had plot lines concerning his character William Bell. Some {{months prior to}} the airing of [...] "Stowaway", Nimoy and others had noted that Bell's character would return to Fringe. Anna Torv, who portrays Olivia, was not aware that her character would be channeling Bell until just prior to filming of the episode, and stated of the role, [...] "This is not one I had been asking for!" [...] To prepare, Torv sought advice from her fellow star John Noble, as both as a friend and because Noble's character, Walter, had spent the most time with Bell. She took further advice from the show's dialect coach and reviewed footage of Nimoy's previous work, though eventually she decided to <b>jump</b> <b>right</b> into the role. Noble later commented [...] "I think the solutions she came up with – taking the essence of the man, playing with the eyebrows, simulating the voice — were really smart. We {{had a lot of fun}} doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of SpongeBob translated well into sales figures. In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants dolls {{sold at a}} rate of 75,000 per week, which was faster than Tickle Me Elmo dolls were selling at the time. SpongeBob has gained popularity in Japan, specifically with Japanese women. Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom purposefully targeted marketing at women in the country as a method of the SpongeBob SquarePants brand. Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan as the character's design is very different from already popular designs for Hello Kitty and Pikachu. Nickelodeon also expanded the merchandising of the show, bringing it around $500 million revenue. It was reported that SpongeBob-themed goods are the best-selling character merchandise at Hot Topic store at Park City Center. T-shirts, pillows, shoelaces, pins, sunglasses, and air fresheners were sold [...] "extremely well if they have SpongeBob's likeness on them," [...] said Erin Aguirre, lead sales associate of Hot Topic. He added [...] " [...] come in and they just <b>jump</b> <b>right</b> into it. [...] "Did you see last week's episode?' They totally talk all about it, just that it's funny, that it's hilarious." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{guide to}} , GameSpy stated that Ibuki has [...] "got some unique {{strengths}} and enough versatility that we think she can cope with most opponents. Her damage is a bit lacking, but with enough craftiness in your execution you can make up for it." [...] Listing the biggest mistakes to avoid in the game, GamesRadar advised Ibuki's players to not oversuse her [...] "kunai air-knives", but to rather use them sparingly in not predictably {{as a tool to}} help get close to the opponent. According to GamesRadar, [...] "Ibuki makes up for her relatively weak damage by having some of the trickiest mobility in the game, letting a skilled player dash circles around their confused opponent." [...] According to Edge, Ultra Street Fighter IVs addition of delayed wakeup, which lets one stay on the floor longer after being knocked down to put an opponent off their rhythm, was [...] "primarily designed to nerf characters like Cammy, Akuma and Ibuki who are at their most effective when an opponent is getting up off the ground." [...] Professional player Sakonoko, whose preferred character in Super Street Fighter IV was Ibuki, said in interview for Famitsu that Ibuki in Street Fighter X Tekken [...] "is ultimately based on her SSFIV Arcade Edition version" [...] and so it is easy for people familiar with this game [...] "to <b>jump</b> <b>right</b> in." [...] He also noted a few character-specific changes between these games, such as Ibuki's kunai attacks gaining the knock-down ability.|$|E

500|$|Guitar Hero 5 {{was well}} {{received}} upon release. Seth Schiesel of The New York Times called Guitar Hero 5 [...] "the most enjoyable Guitar Hero game in several years" [...] and [...] "generally well-tuned, often exhilarating rock ’n’ roll experience". [...] Keza MacDonald of Eurogamer commented {{that there is}} [...] "just nothing wrong" [...] with Guitar Hero 5, given the various stumbling blocks the developers had made from previous iterations of the game, {{and the way the}} developers have continued to find new additions to the game. Reviewers greatly appreciated the new features in the game {{to make it easier to}} jump in and play music, from the simplification of the menu system to the availability of every song in all the game modes from the start. Erik Brudvig of IGN considers the menu change to be [...] "one of the best things that Neversoft has done", although the menus are a minor part of the game, it removes much of the frustration with the World Tour and other previous Guitar Hero games' menu systems. Arthur Gies of GameSpy noted that by simplification of the interface, [...] "Neversoft stripped Guitar Hero down to what works and built up from there". Reviewers appreciated the immediate launch of the game's Party Mode once the player put the disk in the system and the ability to <b>jump</b> <b>right</b> into that song through the new menus, and considered this to help make the game enjoyable for social gatherings. Chris Watters of GameSpot considered this mode to be [...] "accessible, welcoming, and delightfully low key". The changes in Career mode, in which the players need not stick to the same instrument or difficulty throughout, was well appreciated. Brudvig appreciated how this allows the player to complete the Career mode without getting stuck on a song, having to go back to replay the Career mode on other instruments, and that with the addition of song Challenges, provides enough incentive to return to the songs to improve one's performance. The new multiplayer modes in Rockfest, which replaced more [...] "arcadey" [...] competitive modes, were considered a welcome replacement, as it allowed players of various skill levels to compete fairly against each other, making the game more friendly to the multiplayer experience. However, Matt Helgeson of Game Informer noted that despite the various RockFest modes, it [...] "all comes down to hitting the notes correctly".|$|E

2500|$|Buckley and Wester, {{along with}} Patrick J. Doody and Chris Valenziano, penned the series. They found the format—ten three-minute segments—difficult to manage because each webisode {{has to work}} both {{individually}} {{and as part of}} the overall storyline. However, Wester noted, [...] "We couldn't get too indulgent, we couldn't delve into long conversations. That helps not only with the storytelling but with the comedy... With drama, it takes time to establish an emotional connection with the characters. With comedy, you can <b>jump</b> <b>right</b> in." ...|$|E

[...] At the Fed Cup semifinals two weeks later, Myskina stated she would stop playing for Russia if Sharapova joined the Russian team the following season: [...] "If she joins our team next season you won't see me there for sure. His behaviour is totally incorrect, simply rude. I don't want to be around people like him." [...] Larisa Neiland, assistant to Russia Fed Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev, added: [...] "Her father's behaviour (at the WTA Tour Championships) was simply outrageous. I just don't see how he could work with the rest of us." [...] However, Tarpishchev himself played down the problem, insisting: [...] "I feel that things will calm down soon and we'll have Myskina, Sharapova, Kuznetsova and everyone else playing for Russia." ...|$|E
