40|$|Inaccurate {{prediction}} of long-term camber in precast prestressed concrete beams (PPCB) creates discrepancies in bridge construction {{which results in}} increased costs and construction challenges. Although {{emphasis is placed on}} erection and long-term camber, these challenges have been found to originate from the difference between the estimated design and measured camber at the transfer of prestress and will continue to increase with time. The estimate of the instantaneous camber is influenced by factors such as the method used for determining the camber as well as the assumed modulus of elasticity and initial prestress, while the measured camber can be affected by the measurement technique, quality of formwork and construction, and uniformity of concrete. To systematically study and eliminate the construction challenges associated with camber of precast girders, a research project was undertaken to examine the differences between the measured and designed camber of Iowa girders from fabrication through erection. This thesis focuses on the causes of error found with instantaneous camber by examining the designer 2 ̆ 7 s prediction method and variables used for design, the construction practices used for producing a PPCB, and the precasters camber measurement method adopted by the precast industry. While the discrepancy between the measured and designed camber was found to be dependent on the girder type, the designed camber was underestimated due to inaccurate variables used for material properties and the design prestress force. In depth analysis was conducted to investigate different methods of camber prediction and to determine the effects that material properties have on camber. Evaluation of the historical camber measurements that were previously recorded using the current measurement technique revealed that camber is over predicted the majority of the time. Further examination of historical data exposed insufficient data that did not accurately capture the instantaneous camber. For this reason, precasters fabrication procedures were observed and instantaneous camber was measured by the project team from over 100 girders. Observations and independent camber measurements taken by the research team led to the identification of discrepancies between predicted and measured instantaneous camber. Results found that friction, bed deflections, inconsistent top <b>flange</b> <b>surfaces</b> due to the finish that is applied, and inconsistent top <b>flange</b> <b>surfaces</b> due to the beam depth not being uniform {{along the length of the}} beam currently produce an average error of 17. 6...|$|R
40|$|Tightness of flange joints {{for large}} {{polyethylene}} pipes – Part 2 Full scale experimental investigationsLeakage that sometimes occurs in flange joints in large size plastic pipelines for water supply {{is a serious}} problem. Research was undertaken {{in order to improve}} the knowledge about the function of such flange joints. The objectives were partly to find out the degree of sensitivity of the design, i e if small deviations from recommended practise is critical, partly to be able to suggest improved design and mounting procedures. One part of the investigation was a numerical (FEM) study of several geometries, which was reported in [2]. Use of a time-dependent material model made it possible to follow the development of deformations and <b>flange</b> <b>surface</b> pressures for long times. Although several important principal findings were made, the tightening procedure and exact material behaviour could not be modelled. Therefore a series of full-scale experiments were made on 630 mm pipes, for a number of combinations of flange dimension and gasket type. This second part of the research is reported here. Since four of the twenty bolts were instrumented, the bolt forces could be monitored and be related to the torque and to the pressure in the pipe over time. This resulted in novel, important information about the functioning of plastic flange joints. In short, the experiments were performed in the following way. First, the bolts were tightened in the recommended criss-cross fashion to pre-determined torque levels. Then the pressure in the pipe was increased until leakage occurred. For combinations of flanges, gaskets and torques where the joint was tight for pressures above 13 bars, the 13 bar pressure level was maintained for up to one week. The relationship between bolt force and torque does not agree at all with the frequently used rule of thumb formula, for the galvanized bolts used here. The bolt force was typically less than half the value obtained by the formula. Hence it is critical to verify the friction for the used combination of bolt material, surface treatment, and lubrication. The bolt forces also appear to be unevenly distributed, which is partly due to successive creep during the tightening procedure. For the high stresses in the flange creep is significant already for so short times as a few minutes, and the effect is increased {{by the fact that the}} bolts and backing rings are much stiffer than the plastic flange. For both the wide and the narrow (ISO) flange type used it appears that rubber gaskets perform better, in the sense that the joint is tight for lower applied torques. The hyper- elastic material properties help to smooth unevenness in the <b>flange</b> <b>surface</b> and to compensate for creep in the plastic. Use of SDR 17 pipes at pressure levels of 13 bars means considerable creep expansion of the pipe, although it is possible to obtain a tight joint. The expansion gives a wringing effect at the flange, also observed in [2], which contributes to concentrate the flange pressure to the outer parts of the <b>flange</b> <b>surface.</b> In summary, flange joints are possible to mount so that they are tight, also for 630 mm pipes. Since the design is a sensitive one it is vital to follow recommendations for 4 mounting of different combinations of flanges and gaskets. In particular, knowledge about the relationship between torque and bolt force is important...|$|E

The <b>flange</b> <b>surface</b> velocity distributions are reconstructed from the scanning laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) measurements to study {{the effect of a}} delamination overlapping the web-flange interface. The surface-bonded piezoelectric actuator(s) placed remotely on the flange produce primarily anti-symmetric wave incidence to the delamination. A two-stage wave mode conversion process, one due to the web and joint filler, and the other due to the delamination underneath the flange is observed. First, we address the problem of identification of delamination by ultrasonic contrast imaging of the web-flange interface using a single actuator. This study is extended further to enhance the ultrasonic contrast imaging at the web-flange interface using a standing wave. A quantitative methodology based on mode conversion strength is developed to monitor different structural features like free-edge, web-flange interface and delamination.

40|$|At Forsmark, {{several cases}} of {{suspected}} galvanic corrosion {{have been detected}} and believed {{to be caused by}} an inappropriate use of graphite gaskets in brackish water. This report studies the likelihood of galvanic corrosion between the graphite gasket and stainless steels and aims to be a reference when investigating galvanic corrosion in the future. To evaluate galvanic corrosion, several electrochemical experiments were studied, such as galvanic series, polarization curves, and galvanic current measurements with a ZRA. The electrochemical results showed that when immersing the stainless steel (254 SMO) and the graphite gasket (Novatec) into brackish water, there was a current flowing between the electrodes. However, the current was very small, which could be explained by the protection from a passive film on the stainless steel. The difference in corrosion potential between the two materials was measured and compared to results from polarization curves. It appeared that 254 SMO would be protected by a passive film at the measured potential. Galvanic current measurements also indicated the presence of a passive film under the investigated conditions. The results indicate that galvanic corrosion itself should not have caused the corrosion attacks at Forsmark. The found corrosion is more likely due to crevice corrosion that was accelerated by the combination of a crevice, a welded <b>flange</b> <b>surface,</b> chlorides in water and possibly a graphite gasket...|$|E

The FE analysis was conducted at 6 discrete accident temperatures, ranging from 150 to 425 °C. The overpressure evaluation used an axisymmetric model of the drywell head region for computational efficiency, and verified it by comparing to results from one FE model which used 3 D solid elements. The mechanical properties of the steel materials were defined as temperature-dependent linear-elastic. The median overpressure capacity at each temperature was determined using a 2 -step thermal-stress analysis procedure. First, a steady-state heat transfer analysis was conducted to map out the temperature distribution in the drywell wall, which is exposed to the accident temperature on the inside and ambient temperature on the outside. Second, a quasi-static multi-step stress analysis was performed. The vertical differential movement between the <b>flange</b> <b>surfaces</b> was monitored and compared to the O-ring rebound capacity to define the pressure at the onset of leakage.

40|$|Abstract. Linear flow {{splitting}} {{is a new}} continuous {{cold forming}} process where {{the edge of a}} sheet metal is formed into two flanges by splitting and supporting rolls. Thus the production of bifurcated profiles from sheet metal without lamination of material becomes feasible. The production of such structures takes place incrementally in a modified roll forming machine. Experimental investigate-ons on a HSLA steel show, that even at a surface increase of the sheet edge of about 1800 % no cracks were nucleated in the profiles. EBSD measurements in the splitting centre reveal that similar to other SPD processes UFG microstructures develop in the processing zone. Thus a steady state is reached in the processing zone where increasing strain has no more (or little) influence on the materials properties i. e. its deformability, as it is typical for SPD-processes. The formation of UFG microstructures {{is considered to be a}} mandatory condition for the linear flow splitting process, as it improves the formability of the material to the extremely high level required for this process. The mechanical properties of profiles produced by linear flow splitting are characterised by large gradients, depending on the local deformation and the resulting microstructure.

40|$|Abstract: From {{analytical}} {{contact pressure}} studies of gasketed and non-gasketed flanged pipe joints, {{it is known}} that good contact maintained over consistently large areas occurs in a no-gasketed flange joint compared with a gasketed joint, where contact is only on the seal ring portion of the gasket. However, the presence of contact pressure and a good <b>flange</b> <b>surface</b> finish does not in itself eliminate the problem of leakage. Rather, it is the surface flatness in combination with contact pressure and surface finish that is necessary to generate effective contact at the inside diameter of the flange. This occurs providing there are no gaps due to deformation arising from the welding process to the mating pipe as flow is proportional to gap height. However, the question remains as how to ensure adequate surface flatness as non-gasketed flange surfaces are sensitive to damage, which may be present in the form of surface deformation, scratches and dents or bulges. A detailed experimental study is therefore carried out to measure the surface finish and surface flatness post manufacture and welding of such flanges. Results of actual flanges were compared with solid circular plates of the same dimension with inserted shims to provide gaps in order that flow rate/gap height ratio be studied. Manufacturing issues with respect to monitoring and controlling deformations are discussed and recommendations are suggested for flange redesign, appropriate welding approaches and manual handling of non-gasketed flanges...|$|E

Dentures were boxed with # 7 wax and culture medium (CHROMagarTM Candida) was poured to reproduce the internal surface. Statistical analysis by Friedman's test showed significant difference (p 0. 01). Analysis by the Correlation test showed higher r values (B= 0. 78; MD= 0. 8341, C= 0. 7362) for the lower dentures comparing the surfaces (internal and external) and higher r values (B= 0. 7861, MD= 0. 7955, C= 0. 8298) for the external surface comparing the dentures (upper and lower). The results of the microbiological showed no significant difference (p> 0. 01) between the brushes with respect to the frequency of the species of yeasts (chi-square test). In conclusion, all denture brushes evaluated in this study were effective in the removal of biofilm. There was better correlation of biofilm levels between the surfaces for the lower dentures, and between the dentures for the external surface. There was no significant difference among the brushes regarding the frequency of yeasts...|$|R
