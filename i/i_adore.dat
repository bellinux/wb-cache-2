Flynn soon secured {{a job with the}} Northampton Repertory Company at the town's Royal Theatre (now part of Royal & Derngate), where he worked and received his training as a professional actor for seven months. Northampton is home to an art-house cinema named after him, the Errol Flynn Filmhouse.|$|E

Fernández said that he {{appeared}} as an extra in several films of Dolores in Hollywood just to be near her. The beauty and elegance of del Río had impressed him deeply.

25|$|I {{believe that}} it is one of my strong collaborations. It already has me worried about the future. This is my best moment now, as far as the match I have musically with Sakis. Without wanting to put down all the people I have collaborated with <b>I</b> <b>adore</b> them like, ex, Giorgos Mazonakis. The people who go to see Sakis musically are very close to me, in {{relation}} to those who go to see a laïko artist. The track was recorded sometime in late November at Kontopoulos' studio, coinciding with the artists' busy rehearsal schedule for The S Club. Before its release, Tamta had not heard the final result as Kontopoulos and Rouvas were in the studio up until the song's release working on the finishing touches.|$|E
500|$|Savage {{introduced}} himself to certain {{writers in the}} North Beach area of San Francisco in the 1970s. He befriended and traveled with Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Stephen Schwartz Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and a trio of postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at Stanford University. One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could [...] "hear and see and know why <b>I</b> <b>adore</b> your public image." [...] Another acquaintance was poet and author Neeli Cherkovski, who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce.|$|E
500|$|... "Adore You" [...] is a pop and R ballad, which {{lasts for}} four minutes and 38 seconds. The song {{performs}} in common time, at a tempo of 60 beats per minute. Played {{in the key}} of C major, the chord structure of C—Fmaj7—Am is followed throughout, and Cyrus's vocal range spans from G3 to A4. Its lyrics discuss [...] "power imbalance in love"; in the chorus, she states her affection towards her boyfriend through the lines [...] "When you say you need me / Know I need you more / Boy, <b>I</b> <b>adore</b> you", although Kyle Fowle of Slant Magazine felt that Cyrus' reliance in her partner is admittedly detrimental to her personal well-being as the song continues.|$|E

500|$|Subsequent to the announcement, John's husband, David Furnish, opined on his {{personal}} Facebook page that [...] "Madonna winning Best Original Song truly shows how these awards {{have nothing to do}} with merit". Madonna commented backstage: [...] "I hope [...] speaks to me for the next couple of years. He's been known to get mad at me so I don't know. He's brilliant and <b>I</b> <b>adore</b> him so he'll win another award. I don't feel bad!"

[...] He said that [...] "season two is worth having in your or your kid's SpongeBob collection" [...] given that the episodes [...] "Krusty Love", [...] "Squid's Day Off", and [...] "Mermaidman and Barnacleboy III" [...] are on the set. Jason Bovberg of the DVD Talk wrote that the season release is [...] "recommended." [...] He said [...] "Let me state up front that <b>I</b> <b>adore</b> this show. I get a total kick out of watching it with my 4-year-old daughter. We laugh uproariously at SpongeBob's adventures and I'm helplessly reduced to a boy about her age as I beam and giggle at the screen." [...] However, Bovberg called the included audio commentaries [...] "downright boring." [...] Various celebrities—including Lance Bass of 'N Sync, Will Ferrell of Saturday Night Live, singer-songwriter Tom Waits, and Jerry Lewis—admitted they were fans of the show.|$|E
500|$|Since Valene, I’ve {{tried to}} do {{anything}} and everything but play a goody-two-shoes. I love Val, <b>I</b> <b>adore</b> her. But I spent a total of 15 years—if you count the first year I played her on Dallas. That was quite an investment for me as an actress. If you were playing a goody-two-shoes today, the tabloid media would be dying to catch you on a bad day. [...] Look at what they’ve done to Tiger Woods. Look at what they’ve done to that man. My feeling is his father—or the absence of his father in his life—is (the root of) what’s going on with Tiger and that marriage. But the media won’t leave him alone. No matter who you are, (the celebrity coverage) is obsessive and constant. It’s hurtful. For me, if they show my face in a bad photo, they latch into me hook, line and sinker. Even Entertainment Tonight now has blood on their hands. It's brutal. I wonder what they’ll do with Alec Baldwin now. He was my brother on Knots. They really threw him under a bus (when endlessly publicizing his infamous voice-mail rant against daughter Ireland, then 11, in 2007). He loves that child so much." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to Bailey's storyline, which she deemed [...] "not surprising", West stated: [...] "He tells Bailey that it's her {{that will eventually}} be Chief when she’s ready. Miranda's reaction could {{only be described as}} shock. While the other residents were running around trying to get information, she was so busy working on the free clinic project that she hadn’t even heard he was retiring." [...] The story of the two Amish girls was deemed [...] "a little side story, which was actually quite touching and well written", being praised for the realistic portrayals and the effects the storyline had on Stevens. [...] "I don't think I've ever realized that Callie and Cristina never really interacted before. When they did speak to one another the episode, their personalities clash right away. At first they were snippy to one another but the two bonded after slicing open a runner's legs and then operating on him.", assessed West, in {{response to}} Torres and Yang's arc, which was described as [...] "an obvious parallel {{to the rest of the}} episode". West compared the reaction of Yang and Torres following the proposals, by noting that the former was [...] "surprised and maybe a little bit touched", whereas Torres expressed fear and concern: [...] "She's worried that he's only proposing because he's still getting over the loss of his dad and just needs someone to cling to. <b>I</b> <b>adore</b> George, but he's a mess right now and needs to get stuff straightened out before he makes any lifelong commitments." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Business School" [...] was {{the second}} Office episode written by Brent Forrester. [...] Forrester had {{previously}} written [...] "The Merger". [...] The episode {{was the first to}} be directed by Joss Whedon. [...] Whedon, who is a friend of both producer Greg Daniels and Jenna Fischer, and also met most of the production staff prior to the episode, stated that he chose to direct the episode [...] "because I already know the writing staff and a bunch of the cast, and <b>I</b> <b>adore</b> the show." [...] When informed that the episode was about a bat entering into the office and one of the characters pretending to be a vampire, Whedon thought that it was a joke, stating [...] "Didn't I just leave this party?" [...] in reference to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. [...] In an interview featured on the third season DVD, Whedon joked that the [...] "Business School" [...] episode and his former TV show were very similar because [...] "Buffy [...] was sad and depressing but... it was funny. Especially when people died. And {{a lot of people do}} die in [...]" [...] But upon completing the episode, Whedon stated [...] "That was just coincidence. But that's how that happened. God, it was fun." [...] Whedon stated that he was surprised with the amount of input he was allowed with the script. [...] "I wouldn't say freedom to do things with it...But way more input was asked for than I would have ever anticipated." [...] At Pam's art show, the pieces which she was supposed to have painted didn't suit Whedon. [...] "I got to the set and saw Pam's art, and I was like, 'This is not right.'" [...] Whedon said that he held up filming for over an hour until the staff was able create new pieces of art.|$|E
500|$|After making three {{separate}} returns in September 2013, September 2014 {{and another in}} February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of EastEnders in EastEnders Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to EastEnders in 2016, appearing in the episode broadcast on 15 January. After this, {{it was announced that}} the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor's personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: [...] "Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst , who <b>I</b> <b>adore,</b> is still in charge I want him {{to be the one to}} oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes." [...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So this is the end of an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been working harder than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud." [...] Windsor resumed filming on 21 March 2016.|$|E
