40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to explain the usage and {{semantics}} of hierarchical <b>defaults</b> in logical specifications. We discuss the usefulness of <b>defaults</b> for different specification scenarios like specialization, aggregation, explanation, revision, etc. To understand <b>defaults</b> formally, we introduce a general framework parameterized on the underlying logical institution extended by an instantiation mechanism for formulae. It is shown that hierarchical <b>defaults</b> have intended models if the extended institution is compact. As an example for a non-standard logic, we give the semantics of <b>defaults</b> in the multi-modal object calculus of the is-core project. To structure and compose specifications with <b>defaults,</b> default-preserving specification morphisms are defined and corresponding colimit constructions are sketched. ...|$|R

40|$|Crises on {{external}} sovereign debt are typically defined as <b>defaults.</b> Such a definition adequately captures debt-servicing {{difficulties in the}} 1980 s, a period of numerous <b>defaults</b> on bank loans. However, defining <b>defaults</b> as debt crises is problematic for the 1990 s, when sovereign bond markets emerged. Not only were there very few <b>defaults</b> in the 1990 s, but liquidity indicators do not play any role in explaining <b>defaults</b> in this period. In order to overcome the resulting dearth of data on <b>defaults</b> and capture the evolution of debt markets in the 1990 s, we define debt crises as events occurring when either a country <b>defaults</b> or its bond spreads are above a critical threshold. We find that, when information from bond markets is included, standard indicators—solvency and liquidity measures, as well as macroeconomic control variables—are significant.

For the Sequel was the version chosen for overseas release, being localized without any subtitle. In both Japan and overseas, Bravely <b>Default</b> met with strong sales and critical acclaim. Common praise went to the gameplay's mixture of traditional mechanics and new elements, along with its storyline, graphics and music. Main points of criticism were its repetitive late-game stages and elements of its social gameplay and audio. Bravely <b>Default</b> spawned multiple media tie-ins and spin-off games.

40|$|How {{to choose}} <b>defaults</b> for railway risk-informed {{regulations}} {{depends on the}} conservatism implicated in the regulatory <b>defaults.</b> Without a universal agreement on the approaches {{for dealing with the}} conservatism of the <b>defaults,</b> however, the desirability of conservatism in the regulatory risk analyses has long been controversial. An opponent views it as needlessly costly and irrational, and a proponent as a form of protection against possible omissions or underestimations of risks. Moreover, the inherent ambiguity of a risk makes it difficult to set suitable <b>defaults</b> in terms of a risk. This paper focuses on the effects of the different levels of a conservatism implicated in regulatory <b>defaults</b> on the estimates of risk. Understanding of the effect of conservatism in the regulatory <b>defaults</b> can help decision makers evaluate the levels of a safety likely to result from their regulatory policies...|$|R

If remains were found that were not deemed sufficiently distinct to warrant a separate genus, often single teeth, these were classified under Megalosaurus, which thus began to function as a wastebasket taxon, a sort of <b>default</b> genus. Eventually, Megalosaurus contained more species than any other non-avian dinosaur genus, most of them of dubious validity. During the twentieth century, this practice was gradually discontinued; but scientists discovering theropods that had been mistakenly classified under a different animal group in older literature, still felt themselves forced to rename them, again choosing Megalosaurus as the <b>default</b> generic name.|$|E
