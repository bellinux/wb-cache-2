5|$|According to the 2008 book The Bomb in the Basement, several {{deaths in}} Israel during 1957–1969 {{were caused by}} 210Po. A leak was {{discovered}} at a Weizmann Institute laboratory in 1957.

Sadeh died <b>from</b> <b>cancer.</b> One of his students died of leukemia, and two colleagues died after a few years, both <b>from</b> <b>cancer.</b> The issue was investigated secretly, and there was never any formal admission that a connection between the leak and the deaths had existed.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{few cases}} of brain {{metastasis}} <b>from</b> gynecological <b>cancer</b> have been reported. This tumor usually dissaminates via the blood stream, normally through surface implantation or lymphatic spread. PURPOSE: We report four cases of brain metastases <b>from</b> gynecological <b>cancer</b> (2 <b>from</b> ovarian <b>cancer</b> and 2 <b>from</b> endometrial <b>cancer).</b> RESULTS: Several months later, three patients developed brain metastases without any other location elsewhere. For the other patient, brain metastasis {{was the first}} sign of her malignant disease. CONCLUSIONS: In brain metastases <b>from</b> gynecological <b>cancer,</b> treatment should consist in surgical resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} prognoses after cutaneous metastases, derived <b>from</b> pancreatic <b>cancer.</b> METHODS: We treated {{two patients}} with cutaneous metastases <b>from</b> pancreatic <b>cancer.</b> We reviewed 40 reported patients {{in addition to}} our cases and analyzed clinical features of cutaneous metastases <b>from</b> pancreatic <b>cancer.</b> RESULTS: The median survival time (MST) was 5 mo after diagnoses of cutaneous metastases. The cumulative 2 -year survival rate was 3. 5 %. The most frequent site of cutaneous metastases was the umbilicus. The MST of patients who were treated with chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was 6. 5 mo, which was statistically longer in comparison to patients without treatment. Prognoses of cutaneous metastases are similar to other metastatic sites <b>from</b> pancreatic <b>cancer.</b> Receiving chemotherapy or CRT was the only prognostic factor of cutaneous metastases <b>from</b> pancreatic <b>cancer.</b> CONCLUSION: The prognoses of cutaneous metastases are similar to other metastatic pancreatic cancers.

5|$|Pain <b>from</b> <b>cancer</b> of the organs, such as {{the stomach}} or liver (visceral pain), is diffuse and {{difficult}} to locate, and {{is often referred to}} more distant, usually superficial, sites.

40|$|Abstract Background Metastasis to the {{urinary bladder}} <b>from</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> is rare. Metastasis to a {{diverticulum}} of the bladder <b>from</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> is extremely rare. We report {{a case of}} isolated bladder metastasis <b>from</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> and invasion localized to the muscularis propria of the primary site (stomach). Case presentation A 90 -year-old female presented with nausea and vomiting that was diagnosed as gastric cancer, the patient also had intermittent hematuria. Pelvic computed tomography identified an abnormally thickened area in the bladder wall that was diagnosed as a diverticulum of the bladder. A biopsy of the bladder wall revealed well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma metastatic from gastric carcinoma. Conclusion Almost all cases of bladder metastasis <b>from</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> had peritoneal dissemination. This particular presentation of bladder metastasis <b>from</b> gastric <b>cancer,</b> {{to the best of}} our knowledge, has not been previously reported. </p...|$|R
