5|$|The 1980 {{eruption}} of Mount St. Helens in Washington, which ripped apart the volcano's summit, was a Plinian {{eruption of}} Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (VEI) 5.|$|E
5|$|By 1803, Accum had {{published}} {{a series of}} articles in Nicholson's Journal, which discussed a number of subjects: investigating methods to determine the purity of medicines, determining the existence of benzoic acids in vanilla extract, observing the <b>explosivity</b> of sulphur-phosphorus mixtures.|$|E
5|$|Activity of Cerro Blanco {{goes back}} 8 mya, when the Maricunga Belt {{in the west}} was active. The volcano is {{responsible}} for a large Holocene eruption with a Volcano <b>explosivity</b> index 7, {{the largest in the}} Andean Central Volcanic Zone for 5000 years. It is comparable to Santorini and Tambora's large eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Only one {{historical}} eruption {{is known}} from Burney, which occurred in 1910. This eruption has a volcanic <b>explosivity</b> index of 2, and was observed by a merchant ship. This eruption appeared {{to coincide with}} an earthquake and tsunami on 24 June 1910 in the area. An unconfirmed report of an eruption in 1920 exists, as well as reports of {{a flash of light}} and earthquakes during the night of 24 June 1970. No reports of such activity were identified in the contemporaneous newspaper , however.|$|E
5|$|Tephrochronology and {{radiocarbon}} dating indicate that Glacier Peak eruptions occurred in 1700 AD ± 100 years, 1300 AD ± 300 years, 900 AD ± 50 years, 200 AD ± 50 years, 850 BC, 3150 BC, and in 3550 BC. The Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (VEI) {{for three of}} these was 2 to 4, small compared to the 5 of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. They were characterized mainly by a central vent eruption, followed by an explosive eruption. These eruptions varied in outcome; some produced lahars, some pyroclastic flows, and others lava domes.|$|E
5|$|The Global Volcanism Program has {{assigned}} a Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (VEI) to all except five of Kīlauea's ninety-five known eruptions {{of the last}} 11,700 years. The eruption of 1790 has a VEI of 4. The eruptions of 1820, 1924, 1959 and 1960 have a VEI of 2. The eruptions of 680, 1050, 1490, 1500, 1610, 1868, four eruptions in 1961 and the current eruption since 1983 have a VEI of 1. The other seventy-four eruptions have a VEI of 0.|$|E
5|$|The Minoan {{eruption}} of Thera, {{also referred to}} as the Thera eruption or Santorini eruption, was a major catastrophic volcanic eruption with a Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (VEI) of 6 or 7 and a dense-rock equivalent (DRE) of , Dated to the mid-second millennium BCE, the eruption was one of the largest volcanic events on Earth in recorded history. It devastated the island of Thera (now called Santorini), including the Minoan settlement at Akrotiri and communities and agricultural areas on nearby islands and the coast of Crete with a related earthquake and tsunami.|$|E
5|$|The latter {{eruption}} {{was observed}} on the 25-26 November by the HMS Conway captained by Basil Hall, and involved {{the eruption of}} incandescent material. According to reports it lasted intermittently for the whole morning that day. A volcanic <b>explosivity</b> index of 2 has been estimated. These volcanic activities were at first assumed to {{have occurred in the}} local Andes mountains, but a geological expedition by Giacomo Bove in 1882 found no evidence of a volcano there; the field itself was accidentally discovered by geologists of SERNAGEOMIN in 1978.|$|E
5|$|The {{most active}} volcanoes are Kelud and Merapi on Java island {{which have been}} {{responsible}} for thousands of deaths in the region. Since AD 1000, Kelut has erupted more than 30 times, of which the largest eruption was at scale 5 on the Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (VEI), while Mount Merapi has erupted more than 80 times. The International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior has named Mount Merapi as a Decade Volcano since 1995 because of its high volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} <b>explosivity</b> index (commonly shortened to VEI) is a scale, from 0 to 8, {{for measuring}} the strength of eruptions. It {{is used by the}} Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program in assessing the impact of historic and prehistoric lava flows. It operates in a way similar to the Richter scale for earthquakes, in that each interval in value represents a tenfold increasing in magnitude (it is logarithmic). The vast majority of volcanic eruptions are of VEIs between 0 and 2.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on September1, 1948, the then-active volcano Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin Island in the Philippines {{began to}} release lava {{in a series}} of {{eruption}} events which continued for the ensuing three years. On December4, 1951, a large, Peléan eruption event later rated between a 2 and 3 on the Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index, sending pyroclastic flows and lahars down the northeast flank of the volcano. The resultant ash flows alone killed an estimated 500people on the island, {{making it one of the}} deadliest volcanic eruption events in recorded history. As the typhoon approached the archipelago, relief agencies were forced to divert aid operations to victims of the recent eruption, slowing the recovery process.|$|E
5|$|Gareloi has an {{extensive}} eruptive history, {{dating back to}} at least 1760. At least 12 eruptions have occurred at the summit, accompanied by lava and pyroclastic flows. Typically they have been characterized by a central vent eruption followed by an explosive eruption, and sometimes a phreatic explosion. All have been of Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (VEI) of 1 to 3. Such eruptions have occurred in 1790, 1791, 1792, 1873, 1922, April 1929, 1950, January 17, 1952, August 7, 1980, January 15, 1982, September 4, 1987, and August 17, 1989. Uncertain eruptions occurred in 1760, 1828, 1927, and 1996.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to most mountain ranges in British Columbia, the Itcha Range represents an inactive shield volcano. This highly dissected volcanic edifice {{consists of a}} variety of rock types, including basanite, hawaiite, trachyte, rhyolite, phonolite and alkali olivine basalt. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and <b>explosivity.</b> Two stages of eruptive activity have been identified at the volcano along with three sub-phases that are limited only to the first stage of development. The main body of the Itcha Range is between 3.8and 3.0million years old and thus over two million years ago it passed the most active shield stage of life. A period of dormancy lasting for almost a million years followed, which was interrupted by the post-shield stage of volcanism 2.2to 0.8million years ago. More recent volcanic activity in and around the Itcha Range might have occurred in the last 340,000years to produce cinder cones.|$|E
5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characteristics of volcanic ash are primarily {{controlled by the}} style of volcanic eruption. Volcanoes display a range of eruption styles which are controlled by magma chemistry, crystal content, temperature and dissolved gases of the erupting magma and can be classified using the volcanic <b>explosivity</b> index (VEI). Effusive eruptions (VEI 1) of basaltic composition produce <105 m3 of ejecta, whereas extremely explosive eruptions (VEI 5+) of rhyolitic and dacitic composition can inject large quantities (>109 m3) of ejecta into the atmosphere. Another parameter controlling the amount of ash produced is {{the duration of the}} eruption: the longer the eruption is sustained, the more ash will be produced. For example, {{the second phase of the}} 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull was classified as VEI 4 despite a modest 8 km high eruption column, but the eruption continued for a month, which allowed a large volume of ash to be ejected into the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The massif {{is about}} 15million years old, with {{volcanism}} continuing up until geologically recent times. Three constructive stages {{have been identified}} at Level Mountain. The first stage commenced 14.9million {{years ago with the}} eruption of voluminous lava flows. These lavas assembled to create a large shield volcano. The second stage began 7.1million years ago to form a complex stratovolcano located centrally atop the shield. A series of lava domes were established during the third stage, which started 4.5million years ago. Renewed activity might have occurred in the last 11,000years. A wide range of rock types were produced during the long volcanic history of Level Mountain, of which alkali basalts and ankaramites are the most common. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and <b>explosivity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of particles (pyroclasts) with diameters <2 mm (particles >2 mm {{are classified as}} lapilli), and can be as fine as 1 μm. The overall grain size distribution of ash can vary greatly with different magma compositions. Few {{attempts have been made}} to correlate the grain size characteristics of a deposit with those of the event which produced it, though some predictions can be made. Rhyolitic magmas generally produce finer grained material compared to basaltic magmas, due to the higher viscosity and therefore <b>explosivity.</b> The proportions of fine ash are higher for silicic explosive eruptions, probably because vesicle size in the pre-eruptive magma is smaller than those in mafic magmas. There is good evidence that pyroclastic flows produce high proportions of fine ash by communition and it is likely that this process also occurs inside volcanic conduits and would be most efficient when the magma fragmentation surface is well below the summit crater.|$|E
25|$|The Global Volcanism Program has {{assigned}} a volcanic <b>explosivity</b> index (VEI) {{to all of}} Mount Etna's eruptions since January 1955.|$|E
25|$|The Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (VEI) is a {{relative}} measure of the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions. It was devised by Chris Newhall of the United States Geological Survey and Stephen Self at the University of Hawaii in 1982.|$|E
25|$|Natural sulfur {{aerosols}} {{are formed}} in vast quantities from the SO2 ejected by volcanoes, {{which may be}} injected directly into the stratosphere during very large (Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index, VEI, of 4 or greater) eruptions. A comprehensive analysis, dealing largely with tropospheric sulfur compounds in the atmosphere, is provided by Bates et al.|$|E
25|$|With an {{estimated}} Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (VEI) of 6, the eruption was equivalent to about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the Little Boy bomb (13 to 16 kt) that devastated Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II, {{and four times}} the yield of Tsar Bomba (50 Mt), the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated.|$|E
25|$|On 8 June 1783, a 25km (15.5mi) long fissure with 130 craters {{opened with}} phreatomagmatic explosions {{because of the}} {{groundwater}} interacting with the rising basalt magma. Over a few days the eruptions became less explosive, Strombolian, and later Hawaiian in character, with high rates of lava effusion. This event is rated as 4 on the Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index, but the eight-month emission of sulfuric aerosols resulted {{in one of the}} most important climatic and socially repercussive events of the last millennium.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the largest}} Holocene {{eruption}}s in Iceland was the Hekla 3 (or H3) eruption circa 1000 BC, which threw about 7.3km3 of volcanic rock into the atmosphere, placing its Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (VEI) at 5. This would have cooled temperatures in the northern parts of the globe {{for a few years}} afterwards. Traces of this eruption have been identified in Scottish peat bogs, and in Ireland a study of tree rings dating from this period has shown negligible tree ring growth for a decade.|$|E
25|$|The {{most active}} volcanoes are Kelud and Mount Merapi on Java island, {{which have been}} {{responsible}} for thousands of deaths in the region. Since AD 1000, Kelud has erupted more than 30 times, of which the largest eruption was at scale 5 on the Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index, while Merapi has erupted more than 80 times. The International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior has named Merapi as a Decade Volcano since 1995 because of its high volcanic activity. Another active volcano is Sinabung which erupted since 2013 until now.|$|E
25|$|Lascar has erupted {{about thirty}} times since the 19th century. Written reports of {{volcanic}} activity exist since the 16th century, when the Spaniards {{arrived in the}} region, though few records exist from before 1848. Some early reports of volcanic activity at Aguas Calientes probably refer to Lascar. Volcanic activity recorded after 1848 consists chiefly of fumarolic emissions and occasional explosive activity. For some eruptions, including the January 1854 eruption, {{it is not clear}} whether they occurred at Lascar or Aguas Calientes. Recorded eruptions occurred in 1858, 1875, 1883–1885, 1898–1900(?) and 1902, ranging from a volcanic <b>explosivity</b> index (VEI) of 0 to VEI 2. The 1933 eruption was seen as far away as Chuquicamata. Another series of eruptions occurred between November 1951 and January 1952; one eruption is recorded from 1940. Eruptions were observed in March 1960, which were accompanied by earthquakes felt in Toconao, as well as in September 1964 when ash fell in Socaire. Yet another eruption sequence occurred between 1959 and 1969. Eruptions in 1972 and 1974 are uncertain.|$|E
25|$|At least 63volcanic {{events have}} {{occurred}} in the Garibaldi Lake volcanic field in the past 1.3million years. Since the early Holocene epoch, there has been no eruptive activity. Future eruptions of Mount Price will probably be similar in character to those that have occurred throughout its 1.2million year eruptive history. The minimum annual probability of an eruption occurring in Canada is about one every 200years; for an effusive eruption the probability is about one every 220years and for a large explosive eruption the probability decreases to about one every 3,333years. This indicates that an eruption in the foreseeable future {{is more likely to be}} characterized by fluid lava rather than major <b>explosivity.</b> However, the majority of these effusive eruptions occur in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province of northwestern British Columbia and central Yukon, which is the most active volcanic zone in Canada. In the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, eruptions occur less often, but it is the site of Canada's most explosive volcanism. The change in eruptive style between the two volcanic zones is caused by the different tectonic processes that formed them. Nevertheless, the possibility of passive lava eruptions occurring in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt cannot be ruled out.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{particular}} Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (VEI) of the Silverthrone Caldera is unknown, the chemistry {{and structure of}} the volcano can be compared to other calderas that have a history of producing some of the world's most violent eruptions. It is about [...] long and [...] wide while the Crater Lake caldera in Oregon, United States is [...] long and [...] wide. Such calderas are usually formed by large cataclysmic eruptions reaching 7 on the Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (described as [...] "super-colossal").|$|E
500|$|All of the eruptions {{listed below}} have {{produced}} at least [...] of lava and tephra; for explosive eruptions, this {{corresponds to a}} Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (or VEI) of 8. They are at least a thousand {{times larger than the}} 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, which produced only [...] of material, and at least six times larger than the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, the largest eruption in recent history, which produced [...] of volcanic deposits.|$|E
500|$|At 9:09pm, on November 13, 1985, Nevado del Ruiz ejected dacitic tephra {{more than}} [...] into the atmosphere. The total {{mass of the}} erupted {{material}} (including magma) was 35million metric tonsonly three percent of the amount that erupted from Mount St. Helens in 1980. [...] The eruption reached 3 on the Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index. The mass of the ejected sulfur dioxide was about 700,000metric tons, or about {{two percent of the}} mass of the erupted solid material, making the eruption unusually sulfur rich.|$|E
500|$|On May 18, {{a second}} earthquake, of {{magnitude}} 5.1, triggered a massive {{collapse of the}} north face of the mountain. It was the largest known debris avalanche in recorded history. The magma in St. Helens burst forth into a large-scale pyroclastic flow that flattened vegetation and buildings over [...] More than 1.5 million metric tons of sulfur dioxide were released into the atmosphere. On the Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index scale, the eruption was rated a five, and categorized as a Plinian eruption.|$|E
500|$|Within these wide-defining eruptive {{types are}} several subtypes. The weakest are Hawaiian and submarine, then Strombolian, {{followed}} by Vulcanian and Surtseyan. The stronger eruptive types are Pelean eruptions, followed by Plinian eruptions; the strongest eruptions are called [...] "Ultra-Plinian." [...] Subglacial and phreatic eruptions {{are defined by}} their eruptive mechanism, and vary in strength. An important measure of eruptive strength is Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (VEI), {{an order of magnitude}} scale ranging from 0 to 8 that often correlates to eruptive types.|$|E
500|$|At 3:06pm, on November 13, 1985, Nevado del Ruiz {{began to}} erupt, {{ejecting}} dacitic tephra more than [...] into the atmosphere. The total {{mass of the}} erupted material (including magma) was 35million tonnes—only 3% of the amount that erupted from Mount St. Helens in 1980. [...] The eruption reached a value of 3 on the Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index. The mass of the ejected sulfur dioxide was about 700,000tonnes, or about 2% {{of the mass of}} the erupted solid material, making the eruption atypically sulfur-rich.|$|E

[...] The lateral blast that killed Johnston started at [...] and accelerated to [...] Even USGS scientists were awed. With a Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index value of 5, the eruption was catastrophic. More than 50 people were killed or missing, including Johnston, mountain resident Harry Randall Truman, photographer Robert Landsburg, and National Geographic photographer Reid Blackburn.|$|E
500|$|Cerro Azul's April 1932 {{eruption}} {{was one of}} {{the largest}} of the 20th century. Releasing [...] of lava, the volcano ejected primarily dacitic tephra, [...] accompanied by rhyodacite, andesite, and minuscule amounts of andesitic and basaltic scoria. At least one eruptive period lasted for 18 hours, creating an [...] "exceptionally uniform" [...] deposit. Eruption columns, extending [...] into the air, were sighted. Phenocrysts were similar to the effusive eruption in 1846. Soon after, both the Tinguiririca and Descabezado Grande volcanoes began erupting, sending clouds of ash [...] into Argentina. The eruption had a Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (VEI) of at least 5.|$|E
500|$|The caldera {{has been}} active {{for the last eight}} million years and eruptions have created several ignimbrites. One of the most recent eruptions {{occurred}} 73,000 years ago and formed the Campo de la Piedra Pómez ignimbrite layer. About 5,000 years ago, the largest volcanic eruption of the Central Andes with a volcanic <b>explosivity</b> index of 7 occurred at Cerro Blanco, forming the most recent caldera as well as thick ignimbrite layers. About [...] of rhyolite were erupted then. The volcano is dormant since then with some deformation and geothermal activity. A major future eruption would put local communities to the south at risk.|$|E
500|$|Eruptions at Sangay exhibit strombolian activity, {{producing}} ashfall, lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and lahars. All known eruptions at {{the volcano}} {{have had a}} Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (VEI) of 3. Despite its activity, Sangay {{is located in a}} remote, uninhabited region; only a large Plinian eruption could threaten occupied areas [...] to its west. Nonetheless, a flank collapse on its eastern side, possible given the volcano's construction and history, could displace nearby forest and possibly affect settlements. Access to the volcano is difficult, as its current eruptive state constantly peppers the massif with molten rock and other ejecta. For these reasons it is not nearly as well-studied as other, similarly-active volcanoes in the Andes and elsewhere; the first detailed study of the volcano was not published until 1999.|$|E
500|$|The first notable {{eruption}} from Mount Cleveland was a Volcanic <b>Explosivity</b> Index (VEI) 3 Vulcanian eruption {{that occurred}} between June 10 and June 13, 1944. Lava flows extended [...] from the summit, and an ash plume [...] high was produced. Large boulders were reportedly ejected {{and carried out}} to sea by eruptive force. The eruption had {{the distinction of being}} the only confirmed direct volcanic fatality in Alaska; a small detachment from the Eleventh Air Force was stationed on the volcano at the time, and one Sergeant Purchase left his post early in the eruption to take a walk and never returned, probably killed by mudslides. At approximately 10:20, a boat sent to search for Purchase witnessed the end of the eruption. The island was abandoned {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
