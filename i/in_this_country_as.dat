25|$|The {{only means}} {{which have been}} placed in my power of 'raising the wages of colliers' has been by endeavouring to beat down all those {{restrictions}} upon trade which tend to reduce the price to be obtained for the product of their labour, & to lower as much as may be the taxes on the commodities which they may require for use or for consumption. Beyond this I look to the forethought not yet so widely diffused <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> in Scotland, & in some foreign lands; & I need not remind you that in order to facilitate its exercise the Government have been empowered by Legislation to become through the Dept. of the P.O. the receivers & guardians of savings.|$|E

Most of the money was taken through the south border and offshore, used {{most of the remaining}} sum to fund their continued operations. According to a written statement from the Macheteros, the action was a symbolic protest against the [...] "greed-infested men and mechanisms which strain our elected officials, government agencies, and social aspirations <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>as</b> well as in Puerto Rico." ...|$|E
500|$|The strike, which {{dragged into}} August, sealed the Tribune's fate. Half the {{editorial}} staff left the newspaper for new jobs during the strike. That summer, Bellows wrote to Matt Meyer, {{the head of}} the new company, that it would be [...] "almost impossible -- with the present staff -- to publish a Herald Tribune I would be proud to be the editor of, or be able to compete with successfully in the morning field." [...] On August 13, with the strike still going on, the management decided to end publication of the Tribune, which Whitney announced in the ninth-floor auditorium of the Tribune building on August 15. [...] "I know we gave something good to our city while we published and I know it will be a loss to journalism <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> we cease publication," [...] Whitney said. [...] "I am glad that we never tried to cheapen it in any way, that we have served as a conscience and a valuable opposition. I am sorry that it had to end." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{hearing of}} the Dutch show of force, {{aboriginal}} tribes from further afield decided to submit to Dutch rule, either through fear of Dutch military might or hope that such an alliance would prove beneficial to the tribe. Representatives came from Pangsoia (Pangsoya; modern-day Linbian, Pingtung), 100km to the south, to ally themselves with the VOC. The Dutch decided to hold a landdag (a grand convention) to welcome all the villages into the fold and impress them with Dutch largesse and power. This duly took place on 22 February 1636, with 28 villages represented from southern and central Formosa. The governor presented the attendees with robes and staffs of state to symbolise their position, and Robert Junius wrote that [...] "it was delightful to see the friendliness of these people when they {{met for the first}} time, to notice how they kissed each other and gazed at one another. Such a thing had never before been witnessed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>as</b> one tribe was nearly always waging war against another." ...|$|E
500|$|... "to willingly allow {{anyone to}} hijack this {{tradition}} that means {{so much to}} millions of Americans {{and so many of}} our own fans for any cause would effectively be just as disrespectful as doing it ourselves." [...] Rapinoe expressed displeasure with this move saying [...] "it was incredibly distasteful, four days before one of the worst tragedies in our country, to say I tried to hijack this event." [...] She continued the protest on September 15, 2016 during the national team game against Thailand. [...] U.S. Soccer then issued a statement saying: [...] "Representing your country is a privilege and honor for any player or coach that is associated with U.S. Soccer's National Teams. Therefore, our national anthem has particular significance for U.S. Soccer. In front of national and often global audiences, the playing of our national anthem is an opportunity for our Men's and Women's National Team players and coaches to reflect upon the liberties and freedom we all appreciate <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> <b>As</b> part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{consequence}} of the Cornwallis Code was that it, in effect, institutionalised racism in the legal system. [...] Cornwallis, in a manner not uncommon at the time, believed that well-bred gentlemen of European extraction were superior to others, including those that were the product of mixed relationships in India. [...] Of the latter, he wrote [...] "as on account of their colour & extraction they are considered <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> inferior to Europeans, I am of opinion that those of them who possess the best abilities could not command that authority and respect which is necessary in the due discharge of the duty of an officer." [...] In 1791 he issued an order that [...] "No person, {{the son of a}} Native Indian, shall henceforward be appointed by this Court to Employment in the Civil, Military, or Marine Service of the Company." [...] Cornwallis's biographers, the Wickwires, also observe that this institutionalisation of the British as an elite class simply added another layer on top of the complex status hierarchy of caste and religion that existed in India at the time. Cornwallis could not have formalised these policies without the (tacit or explicit) agreement of the company's directors and employees.|$|E

500|$|As {{the fourth}} season {{was about to}} begin, almost {{two years after the}} {{previous}} season's end, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that The Wire [...] "has tackled the drug war <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> it simultaneously explores race, poverty and 'the death of the American working class,' the failure of political systems to help the people they serve, and the tyranny of lost hope. Few series in the history of television have explored the plight of inner-city African Americans and none—not one—has done it as well." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety wrote at the time, [...] "When television history is written, little else will rival 'The Wire.'" [...] The New York Times called the fourth season of The Wire [...] "its best season yet." [...] Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times was more reserved in his praise, calling it the [...] "most ambitious" [...] show on television, but faulting it for its complexity and the slow development of the plotline. The Los Angeles Times took the rare step of devoting an editorial to the show, stating that [...] "even in what is generally acknowledged to be something of a golden era for thoughtful and entertaining dramas—both on cable channels and on network TV—The Wire stands out." [...] TIME magazine especially praised the fourth season, stating that [...] "no other TV show has ever loved a city so well, damned it so passionately, or sung it so searingly." [...] The website Metacritic, which gathers reviews from news sources and translates them into a percentage score, assigned The Wires fourth season a weighted average score of 98%, the second highest score for any television season in Metacritic history (with the fifth season of Breaking Bad being the first).|$|E

2500|$|There was no {{question}} of the Liberals supporting {{a continuation of the}} Conservative government, not least as it was feared that an alliance of the two [...] "bourgeois" [...] parties would antagonise Labour. Asquith commented that [...] "If a Labour Government is ever to be tried <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>as</b> it will be sooner or later, it could hardly be tried under safer conditions".

2500|$|On {{his return}} from a {{successful}} loan spell at Blackpool, former Manchester City manager, Sven-Göran Eriksson, named Hart as Manchester City's number one ahead of Andreas Isaksson. After his performance against Newcastle United, Eriksson named him as [...] "one of the biggest talents <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> a goalkeeper", {{and that he had}} the potential to become an England international in the future. Only months later, he made his England debut against Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June 2008.

Later that month, he signed a new five-year contract.|$|E
2500|$|HT {{points out}} that the British government, in a {{classified}} report, discounted the conveyor belt theory, stating [...] "We do not believe that it is accurate to regard radicalisation <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> a linear 'conveyor belt' moving from grievance, through radicalisation, to violence … This thesis seems to both misread the radicalisation process and to give undue weight to ideological factors."

2500|$|The {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the Senate by Senator Wayne Allard (R-Colo.) on November 25, 2003 and designated S.J.Res.26. The amendment changed the language of the proposed amendment, substituting [...] "marriage" [...] for [...] "marital status" [...] and specifying that it applied to [...] "any union other than the union {{of a man and a}} woman" [...] rather than [...] "unmarried couples or groups". The changes were intended to make it clear that state legislatures could still recognize civil unions if the amendment were to pass. [...] "This new language makes the intent of the legislation even clearer: to protect marriage <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> the union between a man and a woman, and to reinforce the authority of state legislatures to determine benefits issues related to civil unions or domestic partnerships," [...] said Sen. Wayne Allard. It was immediately referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.|$|E
2500|$|Nehru {{emerged from}} the war years as a leader whose {{political}} views were considered radical. Although the political discourse had been dominated at this time by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a moderate who {{said that it was}} [...] "madness to think of independence", Nehru had spoken [...] "openly of the politics of non-cooperation, of the need of resigning from honorary positions under the government and of not continuing the futile politics of representation". He ridiculed the Indian Civil Service for its support of British policies. He noted that someone had once defined the Indian Civil Service, [...] "with which we are unfortunately still afflicted <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>as</b> neither Indian, nor civil, nor a service". Motilal Nehru, a prominent moderate leader, acknowledged the limits of constitutional agitation, but counselled his son that there was no other [...] "practical alternative" [...] to it. Nehru, however, was not satisfied with the pace of the national movement. He became involved with aggressive nationalists leaders who were demanding Home Rule for Indians.|$|E
