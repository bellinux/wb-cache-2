Yup said an SS officer had told a million Hungarian <b>Jews</b> would soon be arriving at Auschwitz. Vrba said he also overheard SS guards discuss how they would soon have Hungarian salami. When <b>Jews</b> from the Netherlands arrived, he wrote, they brought cheese, French <b>Jews</b> brought sardines and Greek <b>Jews</b> brought halva and olives. Now it was Hungarian salami.

5|$|After 1948, the {{greatest}} impact came from the large migration of <b>Jews</b> from Turkey, Iraq, Kurdistan and Yemen, and Mizrahi <b>Jews</b> from North Africa, particularly Morocco.

5|$|Although <b>Jews</b> are an ethnoreligious group, {{they were}} {{defined by the}} Nazis on purely racial grounds.

5|$|Another {{source of}} crown income was {{represented}} by England's <b>Jews.</b> The <b>Jews</b> were the king's personal property, and {{he was free to}} tax them at will. By 1280, the <b>Jews</b> had been exploited to a level at which they were no longer of much financial use to the crown, but they could still be used in political bargaining. Their usury businessa practice forbidden to Christianshad made many people indebted to them and caused general popular resentment. In 1275, Edward had issued the Statute of the Jewry, which outlawed usury and encouraged the <b>Jews</b> to take up other professions; in 1279, {{in the context of a}} crack-down on coin-clippers, he arrested all the heads of Jewish households in England and had around 300 of them executed. In 1280, he ordered all <b>Jews</b> to attend special sermons, preached by Dominican friars, with the hope of persuading them to convert, but these exhortations were not followed. The final attack on the <b>Jews</b> in England came in the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, whereby Edward formally expelled all <b>Jews</b> from England. This not only generated revenues through royal appropriation of Jewish loans and property, but it also gave Edward the political capital to negotiate a substantial lay subsidy in the 1290 Parliament. The expulsion, which was reversed in 1656, followed a precedent set by other European territorial princes: Philip II of France had expelled all <b>Jews</b> from his own lands in 1182; John I, Duke of Brittany, drove them out of his duchy in 1239; and in the late 1240s Louis IX of France had expelled the <b>Jews</b> from the royal demesne before his first passage to the East.|$|E
5|$|As word of {{the massacres}} got out, many <b>Jews</b> fled; in Ukraine, 70 to 90 per cent of the <b>Jews</b> ran away. This was seen by the leader of Einsatzkommando VI as beneficial, as it would save the regime the costs of deporting the victims further east over the Urals. In other areas the {{invasion}} was so successful that the Einsatzgruppen had insufficient forces to immediately kill all the <b>Jews</b> in the conquered territories. A situation report from Einsatzgruppe C in September 1941 noted that not all <b>Jews</b> {{were members of the}} Bolshevist apparatus, and suggested that the total elimination of Jewry would {{have a negative impact on}} the economy and the food supply. The Nazis began to round their victims up into concentration camps and ghettos and rural districts were for the most part rendered Judenfrei (free of <b>Jews).</b> Jewish councils were set up in major cities and forced labour gangs were established to make use of the <b>Jews</b> as slave labour until they were totally eliminated, a goal that was postponed until 1942.|$|E
5|$|Beth Hamedrash was the prototypical American synagogue {{for early}} {{immigrant}} Eastern European <b>Jews,</b> who began entering the United States {{in large numbers}} only in the 1870s. They found the synagogues of the German Jewish immigrants who preceded them to be unfamiliar, both religiously and culturally. Russian <b>Jews</b> in particular had been more excluded from Russian society than were German <b>Jews</b> from German society, for both linguistic and social reasons. Unlike German <b>Jews,</b> the <b>Jews</b> who founded Beth Hamedrash viewed both religion and the synagogue as central to their lives.

5|$|By nation, the {{greatest}} number of Auschwitz's Jewish victims were from Hungary, accounting for 438,000 deaths, followed by Polish <b>Jews</b> (300,000 deaths), French (69,000), Dutch (60,000), and Greek (55,000). Fewer than one percent of Soviet <b>Jews</b> murdered in the Holocaust were killed in Auschwitz, as German forces had already been driven from Russia when the killing at Auschwitz reached its peak in 1944. Approximately 1 in 6 <b>Jews</b> killed in the Holocaust died at the camp.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the Second World War in 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 <b>Jews</b> had emigrated to the United States, Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries. By 1938 it was {{becoming}} almost impossible for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country that would take them. After the 1936–39 Arab revolt, the British were disinclined to accept any more <b>Jews</b> into Palestine for fear it would further destabilise the region. Nationalistic and xenophobic people in other countries pressured their governments not to accept waves of Jewish immigrants, especially poverty-stricken ones. The Madagascar Plan, a proposed mass deportation of European <b>Jews</b> to Madagascar, proved to be impossible to carry out. Starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the <b>Jews</b> of Europe. The total number of <b>Jews</b> murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people. Estimates of the death toll of Romani people in the Porajmos range from 150,000 to 1,500,000.|$|E
5|$|By {{the years}} of unification, German <b>Jews</b> played an {{important}} role in the intellectual underpinnings of the German professional, intellectual, and social life. The expulsion of <b>Jews</b> from Russia in the 1880s and 1890s complicated integration into the German public sphere. Russian <b>Jews</b> arrived in north German cities in the thousands; considerably less educated and less affluent, their often dismal poverty dismayed many of the Germanized <b>Jews.</b> Many of the problems related to poverty (such as illness, overcrowded housing, unemployment, school absenteeism, refusal to learn German, etc.) emphasized their distinctiveness for not only the Christian Germans, but for the local Jewish populations as well.|$|E
