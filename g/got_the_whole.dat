They played alongside System of a Down, Avenged Sevenfold and Alice Cooper. Rex did not tour with Down during their spring 2011 shows. Crowbar bassist Pat Bruders filled in for Rex during those shows. [...] "Rex is not gonna be with us," [...] said Keenan. [...] "He's got things he needs to deal with, and we gave him an ultimatum and he's trying to work things out. We've got Pat (Bruders) from Crowbar playing bass, and he's ass-kickin' in the same way. He plays with his fingers—which is really cool; he's <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Geezer Butler thing going on." [...] When asked whether or not Brown was still considered {{a part of the}} band, Keenan was hopeful but hesitant: [...] "I don't know what to really say on that; he's not out of the band, but he's not playing with us live." [...] On June 22, 2011, Jimmy Bower announced that Rex Brown would not be returning to Down, and that Pat Bruders is his replacement.|$|E

After the performance, Little Mix then thank the crowd for coming, make shoutouts to the audience and thank their band.

500|$|The next {{match was}} between John Cena and Bray Wyatt. The Wyatt Family's {{entrance}} was voodoo-themed and performed live by a costumed Mark Crozer and the Rels. Wyatt started the match by kneeling down and telling Cena {{to be the}} monster that he is and to finish him off; Cena refused. Wyatt continued taunts led to an enraged Cena's aggressive retaliation, but Wyatt just laughed while taking punishment. Cena managed to collect himself and reverted to his normal self, attempting his signature Five Knuckle Shuffle when suddenly Wyatt responded with a 'crab pose' that shocked Cena into retreating. Wyatt later hit a DDT on the apron, {{but it was not}} enough to beat Cena. Cena climbed to the top rope, but instead of attacking Wyatt, Cena dove onto Wyatt's henchmen Harper and Rowan at ringside. Cena teased becoming a 'monster' again by preparing to smash Wyatt with the steel ring steps, but he could not do it and threw them away. Wyatt took too much time when he held Cena while singing [...] "He's <b>Got</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> World in His Hands", so Cena hit his signature Attitude Adjustment maneuver but Wyatt kicked out. At ringside, Cena tackled Harper through the guardrail at the timekeeper's area. Back in the ring, Cena put Wyatt in his signature STF submission, but Wyatt reached the ropes. Wyatt followed with his signature Sister Abigail for a near fall. Wyatt introduced a steel folding chair into the ring by tossing it to Cena, again begging Cena to use it on him and thereby ruin his own legacy. Cena instead attacked Rowan (who had gotten on the ring apron) with the chair, so Wyatt capitalized by rolling him up for another near fall. Cena countered another Sister Abigail attempt and hit another Attitude Adjustment for the win.|$|E

2500|$|Ocean's lyrics {{deal with}} themes of love, longing, misgiving, and nostalgia. His debut single [...] "Novacane" [...] juxtaposes the {{numbness}} and artificiality {{of a sexual}} relationship with that of mainstream radio, while [...] "Voodoo" [...] merges themes of spirituality and sexuality, and is an eccentric take on such subject matter common in R The latter song was released by Ocean on his Tumblr account and references both the traditional spiritual [...] "He's <b>Got</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> World in His Hands" [...] and the female anatomy in its chorus: [...] "she's <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> wide world in her juicy fruit / he's <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> wide world in his pants / he wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band / then put the whole wide world on her hands / she's <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> wide world in her hands / he's <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> wide world in his hands." [...] Certain songs on channel ORANGE allude to Ocean's experience with unrequited love. Culture critic Nelson George asserts that, along with Miguel, Ocean has [...] "staked out ground where [...] not competing with those hit-driven [...] acts" [...] and is [...] "cultivating a sound that balances adult concerns with a sense of young men trying to understand their own desires (an apt description of Ocean, particularly)." ...|$|E

2500|$|Donegal's defence {{of their}} All-Ireland title began against Tyrone on 26 May 2013. The match was billed in advance as the toughest contest Donegal would face in Ulster, with the winner thought {{likely to become}} Ulster champions.

The only difference this year was that we were relegated [...] There was {{a lot of talk about}} putting all the eggs into one basket, but it was the same last year and the same the year before.

[...] "It Fills You Up" [...] is an attempt [...] by the singer to explain the inspirational spirit that is often found in his music.

[...] The last song on the album is [...] "Cold Wind in August". [...] Dr. John describes it as a [...] "cross current from forties to seventies music. [...] It's like where Ray Charles left off.
