5|$|Gorgosaurus {{teeth were}} typical of all known tyrannosaurids. The eight premaxillary teeth {{at the front}} of the snout were smaller than the rest, closely packed and D-shaped <b>in</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section.</b> In Gorgosaurus, the first tooth in the maxilla was also shaped like the premaxillary teeth. The rest of the teeth were oval <b>in</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section,</b> rather than blade-like as in most other theropods. Along with the eight premaxillary teeth, Gorgosaurus had 26 to 30maxillary teeth and 30 to 34teeth in the dentary bones of the lower jaw. This number of teeth is similar to Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus but is fewer than those of Tarbosaurus or Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The Murray cod {{is a large}} grouper-like {{fish with}} a deep, {{elongated}} body that is round <b>in</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section.</b> It has a broad, scooped head, and a large mouth lined with pads of very small, needle-like teeth. The jaws of the Murray cod are equal, or the lower jaw protrudes slightly.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{crest of}} Saurolophus {{is made up}} almost {{completely}} by the nasal bones, and in S. angustirostris it is solid. In adult specimens the crests are a rounded triangular shape <b>in</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section.</b> The crest protrudes past {{the edge of the}} skull backwards. Thin processes from the frontals and prefrontals extend along the underside of the crest, probably to strengthen it. At the end of the crest is a swelling of the nasal, which is often termed differently.|$|E

5|$|In the autumn, {{the leaves}} die {{back and the}} outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is then {{normally}} harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point {{in the middle of}} the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The inflorescence takes the form of a globular umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular <b>in</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurids, {{like their}} tyrannosauroid ancestors, were heterodont, with premaxillary teeth D-shaped <b>in</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> and {{smaller than the}} rest. Unlike earlier tyrannosauroids and most other theropods, the maxillary and mandibular teeth of mature tyrannosaurids are not blade-like but {{extremely}} thickened and often circular in cross-section, with some species having reduced serrations. Tooth counts tend to be consistent within species, and larger species tend to have lower tooth counts than smaller ones. For example, Alioramus had 76 to 78 teeth in its jaws, while Tyrannosaurus had between 54 and 60.|$|E
5|$|At {{the back}} of the skull there is a protrusion, called the nuchal crest, arising from the fused parietal bones, a feature shared with all tyrannosaurids. In Alioramus, the nuchal crest is greatly thickened, {{similarly}} to Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Like the rest of the skull, the lower jaw of Alioramus was long and slender, another possible juvenile characteristic. As in Tarbosaurus, a ridge on the outer surface of the angular bone of the lower jaw articulated with the rear of the dentary bone, locking the two bones together and removing much of the flexibility seen in other tyrannosaurids. Other tyrannosaurids had four premaxillary teeth, D-shaped <b>in</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section,</b> on each side. Including 16 or 17 in each maxilla, and 18 in each dentary, Alioramus had 76 or 78 teeth, more than any other tyrannosaurid. The braincase of A. altai was intermediate between the basal theropod and avialan conditions.|$|E

5|$|Bulbs {{offered for}} sale are {{referred}} to as either 'round' or 'double nose'. Round bulbs are circular <b>in</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> and produce a single flower stem, while double nose bulbs have more than one bulb stem attached at the base and produce two or more flower stems, but bulbs with more than two stems are unusual. Planted narcissi bulbs produce daughter bulbs in the axil of the bulb scales, leading to the dying off of the exterior scales. To prevent planted bulbs forming more and more small bulbs, they can be dug up every 5–7 years, and the daughters separated and replanted separately, provided that a piece of the basal plate, where the rootlets are formed, is preserved. For daffodils to flower {{at the end of the}} winter or early spring, bulbs are planted in autumn (September–November). This plant does well in ordinary soil but flourishes best in rich soil. Daffodils like the sun but also accepts partial shade exposure.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus had {{a massive}} skull that could reach more than 1meter (3.3ft) in length. The bones were heavily {{constructed}} and some, including the nasal bones {{on top of}} the snout, were fused for strength. Large fenestrae (openings) in the skull reduced its weight. An adult Daspletosaurus was armed with about six dozen teeth that were very long but oval <b>in</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> rather than blade-like. Unlike its other teeth, those in the premaxilla {{at the end of the}} upper jaw had a D-shaped cross section, an example of heterodonty always seen in tyrannosaurids. Unique skull features included the rough outer surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the pronounced crests around the eyes on the lacrimal, postorbital, and jugal bones. The orbit (eye socket) was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus. Split carinae have been found on Daspletosaurus teeth.|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus is {{not known}} well from non-vertebral material, {{currently}} only consisting of partial ribs and a fragment of a pelvis. One of the ribs attached to the cervicals, and is quite fragmentary. It is elongated, although {{that might be a}} feature of distortion. Also undescribed by Bonaparte & Mateus are a set of thoratic ribs. Two ribs are from {{the left side of the}} animal. They are T-shaped <b>in</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section,</b> and display plesiomorphic features, although their incomplete state makes their identification uncertain. Multiple right ribs are preserved, including both the shafts and heads. They are similar to the left ribs, which also show that they lack pneumtization. Other appendicular (non-vertebral) material includes a very incomplete and fragmentary shaft of the pubis, and over one hundred gastroliths. The pubis displays practically no anatomical features, and the gastroliths were not described in detail by Mannion et al. in 2012.|$|E
40|$|In {{the absence}} of inelastic scattering, Feshbach {{resonances}} produce poles in scattering lengths and very large peaks <b>in</b> elastic <b>cross</b> <b>sections.</b> However, inelastic scattering removes the poles. Even for quite weak inelastic scattering the peaks <b>in</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> are dramatically suppressed. A resonant scattering length is defined to characterize {{the strength of the}} resonance, and is shown to be small for most collisions of ultracold molecules. The results suggest that <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> for ultracold molecular inelastic collisions are much less sensitive to details of the potential than has been believed...|$|R

5|$|The {{lifespan}} of the Columbian mammoth {{is thought}} to have been about 80 years. The lifespan of a mammal is related to its size; Columbian mammoths are larger than modern elephants, which have a lifespan of about 60 years. The age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting the growth rings of its tusks when viewed <b>in</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section.</b> However, ring-counting does not account for a mammoth's early years; early growth is represented in tusk tips, which are usually worn away. In the remainder of the tusk each major line represents a year, with weekly and daily lines found in between. Dark bands correspond to summer, making it possible to determine the season in which a mammoth died. Tusk growth slowed when foraging became more difficult, such as during illness or when a male mammoth was banished from the herd (male elephants live with their herds until about the age of ten).|$|E
5|$|Four {{specimens}} (MACN Pv-RN 702A through 702D) {{are thought}} to represent second upper incisors (I2) of Ferugliotherium. 702A (height 1.5mm; width 1.1mm) and 702B are slightly larger than 702C (height 1.2mm; width 0.9mm) and 702D. The smaller incisors cannot be lateral incisors (I3), because 702C's wear facet is stronger than would be expected in an I3; therefore, all four upper incisors are identified as central incisors (I2). To explain the size difference, Krause and colleagues suggested that Ferugliotherium was variable in size or that the smaller incisors were deciduous precursors of the larger permanent tooth. They considered it less likely that multiple species with similar incisors were present. The upper incisors have enamel only on the dorsal side. The wear facet at the tip is preserved only in 702C, forming an angle of 52° with the dorsal side, and is more concave than the facet in the lower incisors. 702A–D are recognizable as upper incisors {{because they have a}} less acute angle at the tip and are less laterally compressed, more curved, and elliptical <b>in</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: Atherosclerotic luminal {{narrowing}} {{is caused}} by plaque growth and arterial remodeling. In peripheral arteries, a role for constrictive remodeling in luminal narrowing has been recognized, but the impact on lumen decrease {{has not yet been}} assessed. We studied to what extent arterial remodeling and plaque formation contribute to luminal narrowing in the superficial femoral artery. Methods: Elderly subjects (n = 79) were studied. Post mortem, pressure-fixed femoral arteries (n = 125) were dissected and divided into 0. 5 -cm segments (n = 3266). <b>In</b> each <b>cross</b> <b>section,</b> we measured lumen area, plaque area, and the area encompassed by the internal elastic lamina (IEL area). For each artery, the <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> with the least amount of plaque was considered the reference segment. <b>In</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> with a decrease in lumen area compared with the reference, we determined the contributions of both plaque increase and IEL area change. Results: A decrease in lumen area was found <b>in</b> 2193 <b>cross</b> <b>sections.</b> <b>In</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> with > 50 % lumen stenosis, plaque increase (accompanied by IEL area increase) fully explained lumen decrease in 80 of 280 <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> (29 %). <b>In</b> the remaining 200 of 280 <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> (71 %), both plaque increase and IEL area decrease contributed to lumen stenosis. In 57 of 280 <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> (20 %), IEL area decrease was the major determinant of lumen decrease, dominating over plaque increase. In 143 of 280 <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> (51 %), plaque increase was the major determinant, dominating over IEL area decrease. Conclusion: The results of this post mortem study suggest that in a substantial part (20 %) of severely stenotic lesions in the femoral artery, constrictive remodeling, not plaque size, is the major determinant of lumen decrease. Further serial studies are needed to confirm these results. (J Vasc Surg 2002; 36 : 1194 - 7. ...|$|R
