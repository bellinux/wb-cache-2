5|$|Nixon, {{somewhat}} dazed by {{the conversation}} with Dewey, <b>dressed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> speech and reviewed his notes. Chotiner came into the senator's room, {{and told him that}} if he was forced off the ticket, Chotiner would call a huge press conference and reveal all the maneuvering that had led to Nixon's departure; Chotiner added that the resulting furor would mean nothing to either of the two men, since they would be through with politics anyway. Nixon later stated that Chotiner's promise broke the tension and gave him a needed lift. Senator and Mrs. Nixon and his staff journeyed to the El Capitan, where they were met by a cheering group of Young Republicans on the sidewalk outside, including future White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman. In Cleveland, General and Mamie Eisenhower, with the general's aides, prepared to watch the speech on television in the manager's office above the Cleveland Public Auditorium, where the presidential candidate was to speak.|$|E

5|$|Ninety {{seconds after}} Wallace shoved Artest, most of both teams' {{players and coaches}} were huddled at midcourt, {{attempting}} to calm down Wallace (Tayshaun Prince was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire incident; others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions). While Artest {{was lying on the}} table, Wallace threw a towel at him, causing Artest to briefly stand up before being held back by coaches. A spectator, John Green, then threw a plastic cup of Diet Coke at Artest, hitting him in the chest. Artest jumped off the table, ran into the stands, and grabbed a man, Michael Ryan, who he mistakenly believed was responsible. Boyle stood up to try and hold back Artest and was trampled in the effort, suffering five fractured vertebrae and a gouge on his head. Jackson followed Artest into the stands and punched a fan, William Paulson, in the face in retaliation for the man throwing another drink in Artest's face while he was being restrained by other spectators. Pacers players Eddie Gill, David Harrison, Reggie Miller (who was not <b>dressed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game due to injury), Fred Jones, and Jamaal Tinsley, the Pistons' Rasheed Wallace, and numerous personnel (including Pistons radio analyst and former player Rick Mahorn) also quickly entered the stands to retrieve Artest and Jackson, and to break up the fighting. Green punched Artest twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace's brother, David, to Jones. More fans then began throwing drinks and other objects, while a number of fans spilled out onto the court.|$|E

25|$|Cutler {{began dating}} reality {{television}} star Kristin Cavallari in Fall 2010 and became engaged {{to her in}} April 2011.

They have two sons and a daughter. Camden Jack (born August 8, 2012) and Jaxon Wyatt (born May 7, 2014). Despite {{the birth of his}} first son coming the day before the Bears played their preseason opener against the Denver Broncos, Cutler <b>dressed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game, though he did not play. Cavallari gave birth to daughter, Saylor James, on November 23, 2015.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2013–14 trade deadline, the Blues traded Halák, Chris Stewart, William Carrier, {{a first-round}} draft pick in 2015, and a {{conditional}} third-round draft pick in 2014 to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Ryan Miller and Steve Ott on 28 February 2014. Halák did not appear in a game for the Sabres and was ultimately dealt along with a third round draft pick to the Washington Capitals in exchange for Michal Neuvirth and Rostislav Klesla at the trade deadline. Halák <b>dressed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sabres as the backup goaltender in one game, making him the 10th player in Sabres history to dress for the team in a regular-season game but not play.|$|E

25|$|The couple {{married on}} May 1, 1967, at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. The wedding, {{arranged}} by Parker to maximize publicity, featured very few guests and {{was over in}} only eight minutes. It {{was followed by a}} quick press conference and a $10,000 breakfast reception, attended by friends, family, and business associates from MGM, RCA, and the William Morris Agency. The wedding caused rifts between Elvis and several of his closest friends who were not invited to the actual wedding ceremony. Red West, especially, was furious about the situation. He and his wife had been personally invited by Elvis to Las Vegas for the wedding, had <b>dressed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> occasion, and at the last minute were told {{that they would not be}} present. For Red, who had been with Elvis since the beginning of his rise to fame and had given Elvis the role of best man at his own wedding, this was enough of an insult that he decided to quit his job working for Elvis. Many other friends of Elvis were also disappointed and held resentment towards him for many years to follow, although they mainly blamed Parker for their exclusion rather than Elvis himself.|$|E
25|$|After {{a season}} of AAA midget with the Windsor Jr. Spitfires, Kassian debuted at the major junior level with the Peterborough Petes in 2007–08. Playing in his first career OHL game, he {{recorded}} two assists against the Sudbury Wolves on September 20, 2007. He scored his first OHL goal the following month against the Erie Otters on October 11. He went on to score 9 goals and 21 points over 58 games as a rookie. The following season, he improved to 24 goals and 63 points over 61 games. He also had a team-leading 136 penalty minutes and {{earned a reputation as}} a willing fighter with 13 fighting majors. That season, he was chosen to play in three All-Star exhibitions. Near the beginning of the campaign, he represented Team OHL in two games against a select team of Russian juniors, as part of the annual Subway Super Series. Kassian later <b>dressed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Conference in the OHL All-Star Classic and scored a goal and an assist. Lastly, he competed in the 2009 CHL Top Prospects Game for Team Cherry, a contest in which he injured John Tavares with a hit.|$|E
25|$|On 28 December 2010, Svatoš {{returned}} to North America with NHL ambitions {{and signed a}} one-year, two-way contract with the St. Louis Blues. However, in order {{to return to the}} NHL he was placed on waivers due to starting the season in Europe and the following day on 29 December, was subsequently claimed by the Nashville Predators. On 31 December 2010, he <b>dressed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Predators to make his 2010–11 season debut in an away game win over the Minnesota Wild. In his fourth game, Svatos registered the only goal for the Predators in a 5–2 victory over the Los Angeles Kings on 6 January 2011. Leading up to the trade deadline, Svatos was waived by the Predators after nine games and was subsequently claimed by the Ottawa Senators on 24 February 2011. Svatos earned a regular shift with the Senators and on 27 March 2011, he scored his second goal of the game, which marked his 100th career NHL goal, in a defeat by the Atlanta Thrashers. Svatos appeared in 19 games for the Senators before he suffered a season ending concussion {{as a result of an}} check from Jay Rosehill in a late season contest against the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E

25|$|When Marge {{escapes from}} the {{courtroom}} {{and goes to the}} library to see who Becky really is, she realizes that she is insane and being unfair to Becky, after finding nothing bad about her and a newspaper tablet of how Marge ruined Becky's marriage. Finally, she returns home, only to find Homer tied up, Lisa's arms and legs stuck to the wall, Maggie stuck in a cage, and Becky holding a knife in her hands. When Becky is about to 'kill' Homer, Marge snatches the knife from her and attempts to strangle her. It turns out that Bart is filming a scene in his movie for the school (now a music video). Homer also reveals that while he was fixing Marge's car, he accidentally drained the brake fluid. Marge apologizes to Becky, but Becky admits she was going to kill Marge and steal her family, but decided not to after she couldn't get a shovel. Suddenly the mental hospital doctors show up and shoot three tranquilizer darts into Marge's neck, which don't take effect. Marge tells them that she has too much to do to take a nap. She instructs Lisa to take Maggie out of the cage and tells Homer that she has some 'S for him' - scrubbing and mopping, since he is <b>dressed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> job anyway. As Marge giggles, Homer fires a dart borrowed from the doctors into her, which sends her straight to sleep.|$|E

500|$|Chapman Square, {{part of the}} Plaza Blocks parks with Lownsdale Square, is {{also named}} in his honor. [...] The two blocks were {{purchased}} from Chapman for $1200. Lownsdale Square contains the Spanish–American War Soldier's Monument, erected after Harvey W. Scott wrote an editorial pleading for {{a monument to the}} war on June 18, 1899. The monument includes the statue of a soldier <b>dressed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Spanish–American War sculpted by Douglas Tilden. While the granite base is inscribed with Roman numerals indicating 1904, the base was not received until October 1905, and the monument was not dedicated until May 30, 1906, Memorial Day. The final cost of the monument was $14,722, paid for by donations following Scott's plea. The monument also contains two howitzers, donated by Henry E. Dosch, which he found buried in the beach near Fort Sumter. Dosch noted the howitzers had been used by both sides in the American Civil War. There is also a drinking fountain in the square, Fountain for Company H, donated to the city by the Ladies Auxiliary of Company H (of the 2nd Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment). The fountain was a design of John H. Beaver, dedicated on September 2, 1914.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{were looking}} for an actor who could portray Silver as a [...] "quirky kid who moves to her own beat".

[...] The producers were fans of Tristan Wilds for his acting on The Wire, and hoped to hire him as Dixon from the start of casting. When asked about Michael Steger, who portrays Navid, Sachs said [...] "he's just great". Rob Estes, the last actor to join the series, was a previous cast member of the first Beverly Hills, 90210 spin-off, Melrose Place. Estes was sought by The CW to play Harry, but was contracted on the drama Women's Murder Club. When that series was canceled, Sachs called Estes and explained the spin-off to him, and {{he thought it was a}} great idea. Sachs promised that although he was playing a parent, he would not [...] "be furniture... as in the seldom seen or heard parents who populate many youth-centric series, like the Walsh parents on the original 90210." ...|$|E
