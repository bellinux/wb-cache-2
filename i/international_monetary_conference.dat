5|$|In August 1878, Walker {{represented}} the United States {{at the third}} <b>International</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Conference</b> in Paris while also attending the 1878 Exposition. Not only were the attempts by the United States to re-establish an international silver standard defeated, but Walker also had to scramble to complete the report on the Exposition in only four days. Although {{he returned to the}} U.S. in October disheartened by the failure of the conference and exhausted by his obligations at the Exposition, the trip had secured Walker a commanding national and international reputation.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Walker {{served on}} the {{editorial}} staff of the Springfield Republican before using his family and military connections to gain appointment as the Chief of the Bureau of Statistics from 1869 to 1870 and Superintendent of the 1870 census where he published an award-winning Statistical Atlas visualizing {{the data for the}} first time. He joined Yale University's Sheffield Scientific School as a professor of political economy in 1872 and rose to international prominence serving as a chief member of the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition, American representative to the 1878 <b>International</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Conference,</b> President of the American Statistical Association in 1882, and inaugural President of the American Economic Association in 1886, {{and vice president of the}} National Academy of Sciences in 1890. Walker also led the 1880 census which resulted in a twenty-two volume census, cementing Walker's reputation as the nation's preeminent statistician.|$|E
5|$|During his tenure, McCreary {{represented}} Kentucky's agricultural interests, {{introducing a}} bill to create the United States Department of Agriculture. A bill containing most of the same provisions as the one McCreary authored was passed later in the session. He also proposed a successful amendment to the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act that excluded farm implements and machinery from the tariff. An advocate of free silver, he was appointed by President Benjamin Harrison to be a delegate to the <b>International</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Conference</b> held in Brussels, Belgium, in 1892. As chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, he authored {{a bill to}} establish a court that would settle disputed land claims stemming from the Gadsden Purchase and the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. He advocated {{the creation of a}} railroad linking Canada, the United States, and Mexico. In 1890, he sponsored a bill authorizing the first Pan-American Conference and was an advocate of the Pan-American Medical Conference that met in Washington, D.C., in 1893. He authored a report declaring American hostility to European ownership of a canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and sponsored legislation authorizing the U.S. president to retaliate against foreign vessels that harassed American fishing boats.|$|E

25|$|Evarts {{served as}} counsel for President-elect Rutherford B. Hayes before the Electoral Commission that {{resolved}} the disputed presidential election of 1876. During President Hayes' administration, {{he served as}} Secretary of State. Initially, Evarts did not act upon reports of corruption in the foreign service and supported actions against internal whistleblowers John Myers, Wiley Wells and later John Mosby. However, when President Grant continued to hear such complaints during his post-presidential around-the-world tour, and such were confirmed by internal troubleshooters DeB. Randolph Keim and former General turned consul to Japan Julius Stahel, Evarts began to clean house before the 1880 election. He ultimately secured the resignation of a favorite subordinate, Frederick W. Seward, for shielding rascals, and then several consuls in the Far East, including George Seward, David Bailey and David Sickels. In 1881, Evarts was a delegate to the <b>International</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Conference</b> at Paris.|$|E
500|$|In 1867, an <b>international</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conference</b> {{was held}} in Paris to discuss how to have gold coins of various {{countries}} struck to a common standard. [...] Slight adjustments to the British gold sovereign and to the five-dollar gold piece (or half eagle) would make each equal to 25 francs, and it was proposed that the British and Americans make those changes while France began striking a 25-franc piece. [...] None of this ever came to fruition, but in January 1868, Ohio Senator John Sherman introduced legislation to place the United States formally on the gold standard, to eliminate silver as a legal tender, and to implement {{the recommendations of the}} conference.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Shultz's {{attention}} was increasingly diverted from the domestic economy {{to the international}} arena. He participated in an <b>international</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conference</b> in Paris in 1973, which {{grew out of the}} 1971 decision to abolish the gold standard, a decision that Shultz and Paul Volcker had supported (see Nixon Shock). The conference formally abolished the Bretton Woods system, thereby causing all currencies to float. During this period Shultz co-founded the [...] "Library Group," [...] which became the G7. Shultz resigned shortly before Nixon to return to private life.|$|E
6000|$|The {{question}} of a double standard has provoked no little vehement [...] discussion and has called forth a considerable literature since [...] the fall of silver in 1876. A body of opinion exists, best [...] represented in this country by F. A. Walker and S. D. Horton, that [...] the relative values of gold and silver may be kept unchanged, in [...] spite of all natural causes, {{by the force of}} law, which, provided [...] that enough countries join in the plan, shall fix the ratio of [...] exchange in the coinage for all great commercial countries, and by [...] this means keep the coinage ratio equivalent to the bullion ratio. [...] The difficulty with this scheme, even if it were wholly [...] sufficient, has thus far been in the obstacles to international [...] agreement. After several <b>international</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conferences,</b> in [...] 1867, 1878, and 1881, the project seems now to have been [...] practically abandoned by all except the most sanguine.

2500|$|On January 1, 1891, Martí's essay [...] "Nuestra America" [...] was {{published}} in New York's Revista Ilustrada, and on the 30th of that month in Mexico's El Partido Liberal. He actively participated in the Conferencia Monetaria Internacional (The <b>International</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Conference)</b> in New York during that time as well. On June 30 {{his wife and son}} arrived in New York. After a short time, in which Carmen Zayas Bazán realized that Martí's dedication to Cuban independence surpassed that of supporting his family, she returned to Havana with her son on August 27. Martí would never see them again. The fact that his wife never shared the convictions central to his life was an enormous personal tragedy for Martí. He turned for solace to Carmen Miyares de Mantilla, a Venezuelan who ran a boarding house in New York, and he is presumed to be the father of her daughter María Mantilla, who was in turn the mother of the actor Cesar Romero, who proudly claimed to be Martí's grandson. In September Martí became sick again. He intervened in the commemorative acts of The Independents, causing the Spanish consul in New York to complain to the Argentine and Uruguayan governments. Consequently, Martí resigned from the Argentinean, Paraguayan, and Uruguayan consulates. In October he published his book Versos Sencillos.|$|E

6000|$|For {{the facts}} {{in regard to the}} {{production}} of the precious metals, [...] see the investigation by Dr. Adolf Soetbeer,(230) from which Chart [...] IX has been taken.

The last period has been [...] added by me from figures taken from the reports of the Director of [...] the United States Mint.

40|$|Yen carry trades have {{traditionally}} been viewed in narrow terms purely as a foreign exchange transaction. However, evidence from the waxing and waning of balance sheets of foreign banks operating in Japan points to a broader notion of the carry trade. Yen liabilities fund not only pure currency carry trades, but also fund the general increase in balance sheets of hedge funds and 8 ̆ 5 nancial intermediaries. The di¤erence in overnight rates across countries is a crucial determinant of balance sheet changes. Domestic monetary policy thus has a global dimension.
