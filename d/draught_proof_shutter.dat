40|$|Since {{more than}} two-thirds of the United Kingdom housing stock in 2050 will {{comprise}} houses that have already been built, the need for a focus of policy on the already-built private housing stock is apparent. This study examines the impact that subsidy can make in bolstering the performance of the Energy Performance Certificate by reducing carbon emissions in the residential sector. The results of a survey of new homeowners' uptake of nine commonly installed energy saving measures in response to subsidy are examined. A cost-benefit analysis is performed using the recently introduced concept of the Shadow Price of Carbon and a model is presented which allows the carbon savings for any level of subsidy to be calculated. The model suggests that subsidisation of the installation of hot water tank insulation, <b>draught</b> <b>proofing</b> measures, loft insulation and cavity wall insulation may be cost-effective, but that the subsidisation of others, most notably interior solid wall insulation, are unlikely to significantly bolster carbon savings.

50|$|In 1984 London Taxis International (LTI) {{was formed}} after Manganese Bronze Holdings bought the London taxi dealers Mann & Overton. LTI {{replaced}} the 2286 cc Land Rover diesel engine {{with the new}} 2495 cc version. The new model was called the FX4S. New rocker switches replaced the old toggle switches on the dashboard, the wipers were controlled by a stalk on the steering column and <b>draught</b> <b>proofing</b> {{was added to the}} bottoms of the doors and black rolled steel bumpers fitted, but basically it was an updated version of the cab that had been around for almost 30 years. At this time, Carbodies were developing a replacement for the FX4, the CR6, which is why this 'stopgap' FX4S was introduced. However, the CR6 was abandoned in 1985 and MBH decided to carry on making the FX4 until such time as it could fund a new cab. The FX4S was superseded in 1987 by the FX4S-Plus, which had a rear compartment redesigned to allow five passengers, the trim changed to grey. A new grey plastic moulded dashboard was also fitted. This was received very well by the trade, as a sign that their needs were actually being listened to.|$|R
5000|$|According to one study, {{in terms}} of {{promoting}} social equality, the first Blair Government [...] "turned {{out to be the}} most redistributive in decades; it ran Harold Wilson's 1960s' government close." [...] From 1997 to 2005, for instance, all the benefits targeted on children through tax credits, Child Benefit and Income Support had gone up by 72% in real terms. Improvements were also made in financial support to pensioners, and by 2004 the poorest third of pensioners were £1,750 a year better off than under the system as it used to be. As a means of reducing energy costs and therefore the incidence of fuel poverty, a new programme of grants for cavity wall and loft insulation and for <b>draught</b> <b>proofing</b> was launched, with some 670,000 homes taking up the scheme. Various adjustments were also made in social welfare benefits. Families were allowed to earn a little more before housing benefit was cut, and the benefit was raised for families where the breadwinner worked part-time, while 2 million pensioners were offered automatic help with their council tax bills, worth £400 each, although many did not take advantage of this benefit.

40|$|The {{restoration}} of the interior of Colonia G&# 252;ell Church, begun in October 2002, is only just the start. The lack of upkeep {{over the past years}} has produced numerous problems. Some are due lo lack of attention or the passing of lime. Others are the result of Gaud&# 237; not being able to finish the work he had created, and that nobody else stepped in lo complete what was left unfinished; even though it was essential to defining his work (as {{can be seen in the}} imperfect finishing touches in the construction work, which distorts the architect&# 194;&# 180;s design).

40|$|At the {{intersection}} of climate change mitigation {{as an opportunity for}} health and housing as a social determinant of health, this research contributes {{to a better understanding of}} residential energy efficiency and health as a socio‐technical system. Improvements in residential energy efficiency may benefit health via the pathways of more adequate indoor temperatures, reduction of energy costs and improved satisfaction with the home, yet better knowledge about the contextual mechanisms is needed for the development of effective intervention strategies. Two observational studies of over 100 homes with an average 4. 7 AccuRate stars in Melbourne, Australia, suggested that the current home energy efficiency star rating was a poor predictor of winter warmth or summer cool, and that householder heating and cooling practices had a strong influence on indoor temperatures. The main study of this PhD research was a mixed methods evaluation of a quasi-randomised controlled trial of energy efficiency retrofits of the homes of low-income Home and Community Care recipients near Melbourne. The final sample comprised 13 control and 16 intervention homes with a pre-intervention mean of 2. 9 and 2. 7 FirstRate stars respectively. <b>Draught</b> <b>proofing</b> and roof insulation raised the star rating of the intervention home to 3. 5 stars. The study combined a phenomenological enquiry into householder practices with quantitative analyses to explain the outcomes for winter. The study found statistically significant benefits in electricity costs, householder confidence in heating and the householders&rsquo; perceived sense of control. The intervention also appeared to have benefited indoor warmth, heating energy costs, greenhouse gas emissions, comfort and psycho-social benefits of the home, with weak benefits in health. Although underheating appeared to have been reduced, it remained a common problem due to the switching off of heating overnight, open bedroom windows, limited recognition of heating as a preventative measure and voluntary underheating. The perceived affordability of energy was shaped by the nature of the energy contract, the budget available for energy and the payment mode. As heating was part of caring, acute illnesses led to more heating and more warmth, and the departure of cold-sensitive persons to the reverse outcomes. The weak effects on health outcomes were explained by non-dwelling related factors that affected the householders&rsquo; physiological, mental and social health. What mattered most to the participants were the retrofit measures, the gains in comfort, the expected benefits in costs as well as educational and social benefits, as many householders had limited energy literacy and were socially isolated. The findings of the study provided new insights for the design of residential energy efficiency improvement programs for older or frail Australians that could provide co-benefits for health and equitable climate change mitigation outcomes. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings and to explore outcomes for summer. Considering that balancing the demands of health and climate change mitigation is a complex undertaking that relies on the efforts of individuals, households, communities, researchers, regulators, building and health professionals, a common conceptualisation of energy, indoor temperatures, housing quality and health is required followed by collective action...|$|R
40|$|Buildings {{are complex}} thermally-dynamic {{structures}} serving aesthetic as well as, utilitarian functions. It {{is essential that}} careful planning is undertaken if buildings are to be energy efficient and cheap to run throughout their-expected life-spans. Although regulations have recently been introduced requiring the values of thermal transmittances (i. e. U-values) for walls and roofs of industrial and domestic buildings, {{to be less than}} specified limits, {{there is no guarantee that}} improved design will result. Also condensation has increasingly become a problem, as natural ventilation has been reduced, because of the introduction of doubleglazing and <b>draught</b> <b>proofing.</b> The use of insulating materials to increase thermal efficiencies " through the reduction of heat losses may also create problems in industrial plant and pipework. Metal structures covered with insulants are thereby hidden from view and so any ensuing corrosion, such as the general attack upon a low-alloy steel or stress-corrosion cracking of a stainless steel, may remain undetected until catastrophic failure occurs. It is, therefore, of utmost importance that the potential for and enhancement of corrosion due to the addition of insulants should be carefully considered. The ingress of water or water vapour into the insulant layer and subsequent leaching is the major cause of corrosion, and it is essential that steps are taken to prevent or reduce the likelihood of this occurring while ensuring that metal surfaces are adequately protected. There is a need to ascertain the heat and mass-transfer behaviours of building and insulating materials. Mathematical models require realistic data to simulate effectively conditions found in real structures. Too often in the past manufacturers' data for thermal properties, measured under laboratory conditions, have been used with little attempt to check on their validity or appropriateness to the conditions which are likely to be experienced. As desk-top computers become cheaper and more powerful these dangers could well increase. The too prevalent trusting attitude that computer predictions are absolutely correct together with a potential lack of understanding of the concepts of heat transfer and moisture mitigation by the users could result in poorer, rather than better, designed buildings. The thermal-probe technique for the measurement of the thermal conductivities of building structural materials has been assessed. This rapid transient and potentially cheap technique could be suited ideally to measurements in such materials. The theoretical basis for the method has been investigated and the accuracies and repeatabilities of thermal-probe instruments have been determined in measurements with paraffin wax. Determinations made with this technique, for masonry and structural components, were found to agree well with the manufacturer's thermal conductivity data. However, further developments need to be made to improve the usefulness of this technique for measuring the effective conductivities of fibrous insulants. Also the thermal-probe technique has been assessed for use in moist materials. Initial investigations with wet-day specimens showed that the probe diameter had no significant effect on the indicated values of the apparent thermal conductivity. Tests to measure the apparent thermal conductivities of aerated concrete blocks, at various moisture contents, gave results that compared well with other published data. Attempts to reduce national energy demands have led to increases in insulation thicknesses in roof spaces in Northern Europe and North America. It has generally been assumed that the apparent thermal conductivity of each material used has been a constant and equal to the value obtained in the testing laboratory. Examination of the temperature profiles through various horizontal thicknesses of loose-fill mineral wool insulants suggests that radiation effects and convection in the upper surface layers exposed to free air result in much larger apparent thermal conductivity values than those generally quoted in the literature, and the magnitudes of these effects also increase with the thickness of the insulant layer. Heat transfer mechanisms have been examined to explain these phenomena. Mathematical models of heat transfers through multi-phase materials have been examined. A model is proposed to describe the thermal conductivity of high-porosity cellular insulant which includes heat transfers by conduction through the solid and gaseous phases and by radiation. Predictions were found to agree well with experimental data for airfilled polystyrene foams and to be of the correct order of magnitude for air/fluorocarbon filled polyurethane foams...|$|R

It {{has been argued}} that employing technologies to visualise energy will assist people in conserving energy. Energy visibility interventions have largely focussed on appliance use and electricity consumption. This thesis aims to firstly explore whether making heat visible, using thermal images, promotes heat (and thereby energy) conservation. Secondly using a multiple method approach, it explores how. Five studies were employed. Study One and Three investigated whether using thermal images as a tailored antecedent intervention would promote energy conservation behaviours. The results confirmed that the images led to a reduction in Kg CO 2 emissions attributed to domestic energy use. Study One and Three indicated that householders undertook more energy saving behaviours in relation to those aspects that were visible in the images. These actions were attributed to simple, energy saving behaviours such as <b>proofing</b> <b>draughts.</b> Study Two investigated how people make sense of the images and how behaviours are promoted by the images. Study two suggested that the images provide a unique medium through which factors which contribute to energy saving can be combined and reasoned by the viewer. It suggests the psychological factors in a pathway from prompt to behaviour. Study Four established that showing the images in an information presentation was not as effective when influencing participants’ ideas about energy conservation. Finally, Study Five explored participants gaze and demonstrated how features of the images, can attract the viewer. The novel contribution of this thesis is in establishing that ‘making heat visible’ through a tailored thermal imaging prompt can increase the likelihood of a householder taking simple energy saving actions, by providing a novel medium through which householders attend to heat and energy use...|$|R
