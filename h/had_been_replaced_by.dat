5|$|The Victor was {{the last}} of the V-bombers to be retired, the final {{aircraft}} being removed from service on 15 October 1993. In its refuelling role, the type <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> the Vickers VC10 and the Lockheed Tristar.|$|E
5|$|Valve ejected during filling due {{to thread}} failure, sank dive boat. Vented {{bursting}} disk retainers in the cylinder valves <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> solid screws.|$|E
5|$|Jaz Rignall of USgamer {{revisited}} Titanfall in late 2015 {{and found}} the game still worthy of its original praise, though he noted that its technical details—namely graphics and framerate—showed some age. He felt that the game's content issues, apart from the light campaign, were resolved by the free additional maps. Overall, Rignall said that Titanfall <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> newer shooter games.|$|E
50|$|BS 25999-2 was {{withdrawn}} in November 2012 <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> the International Standard, ISO 22301. BS 25999-1 {{was withdrawn}} in early 2013 <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> ISO 22313.|$|R
5000|$|Since then, Green Line [...] "E" [...] {{service to}} Arborway <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> the 39 bus, and Green Line [...] "A" [...] service <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> the 57 bus.|$|R
50|$|The old {{building}} appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a housing complex, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> {{a new building}} at 275 W. Market Street. The new building was dedicated on May 2, 1976.|$|R
5|$|Linebacker Antarrious Williams was {{scheduled}} to miss the game after undergoing surgery to repair a dislocated bone suffered in the Tigers' game against Georgia. Williams had 44tackles during the regular season, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Derrick Graves in the SEC championship game. Graves was expected to do so again in the Sugar Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The launch was {{the first}} to use a newly {{developed}} high-performance motor for the solid rocket boosters, which gave approximately 7% greater thrust, and the second-last to use the original standard-mass steel casings for the boosters. These <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a thinner case, saving some , on STS-6 and STS-7, but because of safety concerns the next two flights used the conventional cases.|$|E
5|$|Another {{development}} was the Dreyer Fire-control Table that combined {{the functions of}} the Dumaresq and the range clock in the transmission stations. Hercules was probably fitted with a prototype table when its inventor, Commander Frederic Dreyer, was assigned to the ship at the end of 1911. The ship retained that instrument at least until February 1916, although it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a Mark I table by 1918. Colossus received her Mark I table by early 1916.|$|E
50|$|Samsung {{announced}} the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphones on 29 March 2017. It features an iris scanner, {{which was not}} present on the Galaxy S7 phones. S Voice <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Bixby. In addition, the micro-USB port <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a USB Type-C port, and the physical home button and capacitive buttons <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> on-screen buttons.|$|R
50|$|The ECIP <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> ESSIP.|$|R
50|$|Later graveyards <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> cemeteries.|$|R
5|$|By the Roman Period of Egypt, the {{traditional}} Egyptian reed pen <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> the chief writing {{tool of the}} Greco-Roman world: a shorter, thicker reed pen with a cut nib. Likewise, the original Egyptian pigments were discarded in favor of Greek lead-based inks. The adoption of Greco-Roman writing tools influenced Egyptian handwriting, as hieratic signs became more spaced, had rounder flourishes, and greater angular precision.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still on his door, off the train into a torrent of hail and thunder and walked the few hundred yards to the vicarage, {{frequently}} losing their footing as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train {{and went on to}} Manchester to fetch medical assistance.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{this loss}} of sponsorship, Davies {{completed}} his studies and graduated in 1913. His plans to enter the ministry were abandoned; he was {{an active member of}} the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and his religious vocation <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a commitment to working-class politics. In 1913, while still a student, he stood for election to Cardiff's Board of Guardians, as the ILP candidate in the Grangetown ward. This first foray into electoral politics ended in a narrow defeat, by 47 votes.|$|E
60|$|If {{then our}} diagram {{be assumed to}} {{represent}} {{a considerable amount of}} modification, species (A) and all the earlier varieties will have become extinct, <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> eight new species (a14 to m14); and (I) will <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> six (n14 to z14) new species.|$|R
50|$|In LTE, RANAP <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> S1AP.|$|R
60|$|The {{original}} spelling, capitalisation and punctuation <b>have</b> <b>been</b> retained {{as far as}} possible. Characters not in the ANSI standard set <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> their nearest equivalent. The AE & OE digraphs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> transcribed as two letters. Accented {{letters in}} the Italian poems <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> the unaccented letter.|$|R
5|$|Quenya nouns are {{declined}} for case. Parmaquesta Quenya has ten cases. These {{include the}} four primary cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, and instrumental; three adverbial cases: allative (of which the dative is a shortened form), locative (also with a shortened form), and ablative; and a possessive or adjectival case. The accusative was however only used for Parmaquesta and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> nominative in late colloquial Quenya.|$|E
5|$|Some Canadian and British {{infantry}} divisions {{had been}} temporarily equipped with M7 Priest self-propelled guns for the D-Day landings, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> towed 25-Pounder field guns. Simonds had the Priests converted into Kangaroo Armoured Personnel Carriers, {{which would allow}} infantry to follow the tanks closely on any terrain. Permission was first requested from the Americans, from whom the M7s had been borrowed, to convert them into APCs.|$|E
5|$|The 1866 {{construction}} was considerably stronger, {{compared to the}} two previous spans, due to major renovations. The old cables that snapped <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> newer, stronger ones. Thomas also gave the span a new deck floor, a bridge railing and new stringers. The bridge was much better cared for this time around, as it also survived a local flood in 1903 and an icestorm {{in the early months}} of spring 1904.|$|E

5|$|After López de Salcedo {{had been}} {{installed}} as governor, the emissaries {{that had been}} sent by Pedrarias arrived, expecting to find Saavedra. Although they did not dare to present Pedrarias' demands to a Crown representative, López de Salcedo had them imprisoned. When the Crown had appointed the new governor, it had not defined the limits of Honduras. Pedrarias <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a Crown representative in July 1526; this prompted López de Salcedo to claim jurisdiction over Nicaragua, based upon the actions of González Dávila and Hernán Cortés. He left a few men {{under the command of}} Francisco de Cisneros in Trujillo, and marched with 150 men to impose his authority over Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|All the {{criminal}} proceedings against him were canceled and {{the charges of}} blasphemy were officially withdrawn. Alcibiades was able to assert his piety and to raise Athenian morale by leading the solemn procession to Eleusis (for {{the celebration of the}} Eleusinian Mysteries) by land {{for the first time since}} the Spartans had occupied Decelea. The procession <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a journey by sea, but this year Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional procession. His property was restored and the ecclesia elected him supreme commander of land and sea (strategos autokrator).|$|E
5|$|Between his {{coronation}} and 1071, William consolidated {{his hold}} over England, defeating {{a number of}} rebellions that arose particularly {{in the north and}} west of the country. Immediately after Hastings, only those English noblemen who fought in the battle lost their lands, which were distributed to Normans and others from the continent who had supported William's invasion. The rebellions of the years 1068 to 1071 led to fresh confiscations of English land, again distributed to William's continental followers. By 1086, when William ordered the compilation of Domesday Book to record landholders in England, most of the native English nobility <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Norman and other continental nobles.|$|E

5|$|Braidwood {{regarded}} Westminster Hall as {{safe from}} destruction by 1:45am, {{partly because of}} the actions of the floating fire engine, but also because a change {{in the direction of the}} wind kept the flames away from the Hall. Once the crowd realised that the hall was safe they began to disperse, and had left by around 3:00am, by which time the fire near the Hall was nearly out, although it continued to burn towards the south of the complex. The firemen remained in place until about 5:00am, when they had extinguished the last remaining flames and the police and soldiers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> new shifts.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Edward the Confessor a lady called Elviva (probably a Latin {{rendering}} of the Old English name Ælfgifu), held the manor of Ambrosden. The Domesday Book records that by 1086 she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Hugh d'Ivry, butler of William the Conqueror and brother of Roger d'Ivry, who owned several manors in Oxfordshire. Hugh's nephew Roger II d'Ivry inherited Ambrosden and by 1194 {{it was part of}} the Honour of St. Valery. Ambrosden thus passed to Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, who in 1288 gave the manor to Ashridge Priory of the Augustinian order of the Brothers of Penitence. Ashridge Priory retained Ambrosden until the priory was dissolved in 1539 in the Dissolution of the Monasteries.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{earliest}} roads in the area crossed through Minerva. The first known road that reached the settlement was established in 1804, when land along a highway from St. Lawrence County {{to the town of}} Chester in Warren County was populated by the West family. Minerva was mainly limited to the vicinity of the old highway, but as more people settled along the road, the town began to grow. For a time, the town boasted several water-powered sawmills, and the highway was used to transport lumber. However, the lumber industry began to fail, and by 1840, the logging and lumber system <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> crops. The town initiated river drives, which continued until 1950.|$|E
