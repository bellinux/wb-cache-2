5|$|Herschel wedges, {{also called}} Solar Diagonals, are {{effective}} and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is {{destined for the}} eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface {{of a piece of}} glass. Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected. The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.|$|E
25|$|The Coast Guard's task {{over the}} ensuing years {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of war in the Pacific was to supply these isolated way-stations along the transpacific air routes and to relieve the colonists at stated intervals. Taney performed these supply missions into 1940. Meanwhile, tension continued to rise in the Far East as Japan cast covetous <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> American, British, Dutch, and French colonial possessions and marched deeper into embattled China.|$|E
500|$|The {{game against}} Detroit was {{a battle for}} first place, but the {{suspension}} unsettled the Canadiens. Goaltender Jacques Plante later recalled that the game seemed secondary, and players and officials were [...] "casting worried <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sullen crowd". Likewise, Dick Irvin said later, [...] "The people didn't care if we got licked 100–1 that night." ...|$|E

500|$|Film critic Sukanya Verma has {{described}} Kajol as a [...] "contrasting personality". She wrote, [...] "Think Kajol, think emotions. Either {{she is the}} firebrand or the emotional sensitive types. [...] she is pure, wicked fun." [...] Initially termed by journalists as [...] "an impulsive and impetuous brat", Kajol has defied the stereotypical image of a Hindi film heroine in several ways. Journalist Kaveree Bamzai elaborated, [...] "She hardly looks into the mirror, barely even <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> set monitor, usually the crutch of every insecure actor, puts on make-up only under extreme duress, and [...] never watches her old movies." ...|$|E
500|$|In Franklin, Pennsylvania, {{postal worker}} Edward Funsch (William Sanderson) is {{informed}} {{that he will}} be fired {{at the end of the}} week due to budget cuts.

At Franklin's civic center, a middle-aged man in a crowded elevator sees [...] "No Air" [...] displayed on the elevator's LED display, and is the only one who can see the message. Sweating and obviously claustrophobic, he again <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> LED display. This time it flashes the words [...] "Can't Breathe" [...] and then [...] "Kill 'Em All." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Man Who Knew Too Much", Castiel tricks Crowley and Raphael, {{eventually}} {{absorbing the}} souls from Purgatory. He demonstrates his new power by killing Raphael {{with a simple}} snap of his fingers. While talking to Dean, who unsuccessfully begs him {{to give up the}} power, Sam sneaks up behind them and attempts to kill him with an angelic blade by stabbing Castiel in the back, but it has no effect. Castiel removes the blade, explains that he is no longer an angel, declaring himself their new God. He then <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> three hunters before delivering an ultimatum: to profess their own loyalty and love unto him, or be destroyed.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the music video, Fernández turns on the car radio where a radio personality woman named Veronica is on air and he immediately gets flashbacks of her. Once he arrives at his house, he turns on the radio where Veronica plays [...] "No Sé Olvidar" [...] on the radio station. Fernández <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> photos of him and Veronica and burns them at the fireplace. He steps outside but still cannot forget the time he spent with her and imagines Veronica next to him. He exercises as another attempt to forget but to no avail. Fernández takes a shower and hallucinates Veronica being next to him and holding him. Fernández begins to lose his mind and breaks the house furniture. He picks up another photo of him and Veronica, lits it on fire, and proceeds to set the house on fire. At the end of the song, Veronica asks Fernández for forgiveness on the radio.
