25|$|Historically, in {{orthodox}} Christianity {{the issue}} of the <b>Hypostatic</b> union posed {{the question of whether the}} knowledge found in the Divine component was identical with God's knowledge.|$|E
25|$|That Orthodox and Catholic theologians {{distinguish}} {{more clearly}} between the divinity and <b>hypostatic</b> {{identity of the}} Holy Spirit (which is a received dogma of our Churches) and {{the manner of the}} Spirit's origin, which still awaits full and final ecumenical resolution.|$|E
25|$|Many Christians believe Jesus' miracles were {{historical}} events {{and that his}} miraculous works were {{an important part of}} his life, attesting to his divinity and the <b>Hypostatic</b> union, i.e., the dual natures of Jesus as God and Man. They see Jesus' experiences of hunger, weariness, and death as evidences of his humanity, and miracles as evidences of his divinity.|$|E
25|$|Following the Apostolic Age, {{from the}} 2nd century forward, several controversies {{developed}} {{about how the}} human and divine are related within the person of Jesus. Eventually in 451, {{the concept of a}} <b>Hypostatic</b> union was decreed, namely that Jesus is both fully divine and fully human. However, differences among Christian denominations continued thereafter. See the article on Christology for details.|$|E
25|$|Christians {{in general}} believe that Jesus' miracles were actual {{historical}} events {{and that his}} miraculous works were {{an important part of}} his life, attesting to his divinity and the <b>Hypostatic</b> union, i.e., the dual natures of Christ's humanity and divinity in one hypostasis. Christians believe that while Jesus' experiences of hunger, weariness, and death were evidences of his humanity, the miracles were evidences of his deity.|$|E
25|$|For most Christians, {{beliefs about}} God are {{enshrined}} in the doctrine of Trinitarianism, which holds that the three persons of God together form a single God. The Trinitarian view emphasizes that God has a will, and that God the Son has two wills, divine and human, though these are never in conflict (see <b>Hypostatic</b> union). However, this point is disputed by Oriental Orthodox Christians, who hold that God the Son has only one will of unified divinity and humanity (see Miaphysitism).|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} ecumenical councils were convened in the 4th and 5th centuries {{to deal with}} these issues. The Council of Ehesus debated {{hypostasis}} (co-existing natures) versus Monophysitism (only one nature) versus Miaphysitism (two natures united as one) versus Nestorianism (disunion of two natures). The 451 Council of Chalcedon was highly influential and marked a key turning point in the Christological debates that broke apart the church of the Eastern Roman Empire in the 5th century. In Chalcedon the <b>hypostatic</b> union was decreed, namely that Jesus is both fully divine and fully human, making this part of the creed of Orthodox Christianity.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} genetics, if genes A and B are mutated, {{and each}} mutation by itself produces a unique phenotype {{but the two}} mutations together show the same phenotype as the gene A mutation, then gene A is epistatic and gene B is <b>hypostatic.</b> For example, the gene for total baldness is epistatic to the gene for brown hair. In this sense, epistasis can be contrasted with genetic dominance, which is an interaction between alleles at the same gene locus. As the study of genetics developed, and {{with the advent of}} molecular biology, epistasis started to be studied in relation to Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) and polygenic inheritance.|$|E
25|$|In the 5th century, leading Church Father Pope Leo I {{used the}} nativity {{as a key}} element of his theology. Leo gave 10 sermons on the nativity and 7 have survived, the one on December 25, 451 {{demonstrates}} his concern to increase the importance of the feast of nativity and along with it emphasize the two natures of Christ in defense of the Christological doctrine of <b>hypostatic</b> union. Leo often used his nativity sermons as an occasion to attack opposing viewpoints, without naming the opposition. Thus Leo used the occasion of the Nativity feast to establish boundaries for what could be considered a heresy regarding the birth and nature of Christ.|$|E
500|$|While Maximus was in Carthage, a {{controversy}} broke out regarding how {{to understand the}} interaction between the human and divine natures within the person of Jesus. This Christological debate was the latest development in disagreements that began following the First Council of Nicaea in 325, and were intensified following the Council of Chalcedon in 451. The Monothelite position was developed as a compromise between the dyophysitists and the miaphysists, who believed dyophysitism is conceptually indistinguishable from Nestorianism. The Monothelites adhered to the Chalcedonian definition of the <b>hypostatic</b> union: that two natures, one divine and one human, were united in the person of Christ. However, they {{went on to say that}} Christ had only a divine will and no human will (Monothelite is derived from the Greek for [...] "one will"), which led some to charge them with Apollinarian monophysitism.|$|E

2500|$|To Ehrman, [...] "Proto-orthodox Christians {{argued that}} Jesus Christ was both divine and human, {{that he was}} one being instead of two, and that he had taught his disciples the truth."

2500|$|<b>Hypostatic</b> union (from the Greek for substance) is a {{technical}} term in Christian theology employed in mainstream Christology {{to describe the}} union of two natures, humanity and divinity, in Jesus Christ. [...] A brief definition {{of the doctrine of}} two natures can be given as: [...] "Jesus Christ, who is identical with the Son, is one person and one hypostasis in two natures: a human and a divine." ...|$|E
2500|$|This dogma is {{inherently}} {{related to the}} Christological dogma of the <b>hypostatic</b> union which relates the divine and human natures of Jesus Christ. The Catechism teaches that [...] "Mary is truly 'Mother of God' since she {{is the mother of}} the eternal Son of God made man, who is God himself." [...] According to Saunders, Mary did not create the divine person of Jesus, who existed with the Father from all eternity.|$|E

Aka Manah is the <b>hypostatic</b> abstraction of accusative akem manah (akәm manah), [...] "manah made evil". The objectification of this malign influence is the demon Aka/Akem Manah, who appears in later texts as Middle Persian Akoman and New Persian Akvan.|$|E
2500|$|In 1918, the Holy Office {{issued the}} decree Circa quasdam propositiones de scientia animae Christi which {{rejected}} {{the interpretation of}} Mark 13:32 that Christ {{did not know the}} hour and supported the belief that Christ had complete knowledge at all time, in view of the <b>Hypostatic</b> union.

2500|$|Various {{forms of}} Monophysitism taught that Christ {{only had one}} nature: that the divine had either {{dissolved}} (Eutychianism), or that the divine joined with the human as one nature {{in the person of}} Christ (Miaphysitism). [...] A notable monophysite theologian was Eutyches (c. 380–456). [...] Monophysitism was rejected as heresy at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, which affirmed that Jesus Christ had two natures (divine and human) joined in one person, in <b>hypostatic</b> union (see Chalcedonian creed). [...] While Eutychianism was suppressed into oblivion by the Chalcedonians and Miaphysites, the Miaphysite groups who dissented from the Chalcedonian formula have persisted as the Oriental Orthodox Church.|$|E
2500|$|This {{source of}} all being is an Aeon, in which an inner being dwells, known as Ennoea ("thought, intent", Greek [...] ), Charis ("grace", Greek [...] ), or Sige ("silence", Greek [...] ). The split perfect being conceives the second Aeon, Nous ("mind", Greek Νους), within itself. Along with male Nous comes female Aeon Aletheia ("truth", Greek Αληθεια). These are the primary roots of Aeons. Complex {{hierarchies}} of Aeons are thus produced, sometimes {{to the number of}} thirty. These Aeons belong to a purely ideal, noumenal, intelligible, or supersensible world; they are immaterial, they are <b>hypostatic</b> ideas. Together with the source from which they emanate, they form Pleroma ("region of light", Greek [...] ). The lowest regions of [...] Pleroma are closest to darkness—that is, the physical world.|$|E

He is perhaps best known for having met Attila the Hun in 452 and persuading him to turn back from his {{invasion}} of Italy. He is also a Doctor of the Church, most remembered theologically for issuing the Tome of Leo, a document which was a major foundation to the debates of the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon. The Council of Chalcedon, the fourth ecumenical council, dealt primarily with Christology, and elucidated the orthodox definition of Christ's being as the <b>hypostatic</b> union of two natures, divine and human, united in one person, [...] "with neither confusion nor division". It was followed by a major schism associated with Monophysitism, Miaphysitism and Dyophysitism.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the Greek Fathers, whether Cappadocian or Alexandrian, there is, {{according}} to Siecienski, no citable {{basis for the}} claim historically made by both sides, that they explicitly either supported or denied the later theologies concerning the procession of the Spirit from the Son. However, they did enunciate important principles later invoked in support of one theology or the other. These included the insistence on the unique <b>hypostatic</b> properties of each Divine Person, in particular the Father's property of being, within the Trinity, the one cause, while they also recognized that the Persons, though distinct, cannot be separated, and that not only the sending of the Spirit to creatures but also the Spirit's eternal flowing forth (...) from the Father within the Trinity is [...] "through the Son" [...] (...)

2500|$|In the 13th century Saint Thomas Aquinas {{addressed}} the Christologocal attribution of the nativity: Should it {{be attributed to}} the person (the Word) or only to the assumed human nature of that person. Aquinas treated nativity in 8 separate articles in Summa Theologica each posing a separate question, e.g.: [...] "Does Nativity regard the nature rather than the Person?", [...] "Should a temporal Nativity be attributed to Christ?" [...] "Should the Blessed Virgin be called Christ's Mother?", [...] "Should the Blessed Virgin be called the Mother of God?", [...] "Are there two filiations in Christ?", etc. To deal with this issue, Aquinas distinguishes between the person born and the nature in which the birth takes place. Aquinas thus resolved the question by arguing that in the <b>hypostatic</b> union Christ has two natures, one received from the Father from eternity, the other from his mother in time. This approach also resolved the Mariological problem of Mary receiving the title of Theotokos for under this scenario she is the [...] "Mother of God".|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{doctrine}} Canals’ efforts were multifold. Chronologically the first dogma he tackled and examined {{throughout most of}} his life was this of the Sacred Heart of Jesus; however, he then focused on a number of Mariologist and Christologist dogmas. Two threads which emerged as [...] "más caracteristicos" [...] of his study are theology of history and Josephology. The former, anchored in the vision of earthly Rule of Christ as the ultimate goal, is somewhat opposed to earlier millenarian concepts yet advances their modified version, dubbed by scholars [...] "milenarismo mitigado" [...] or [...] "milenarismo político". Josephological studies are related to the concept of [...] "spiritual infancy", reportedly represented by St. Joseph, his position of a role model and its implications for apostolate of the lay; other associated threads are those referring to marital relations, virginity and St. Joseph’s position in the <b>hypostatic</b> order. In terms of history of theology Canals dedicated most his attention to Aquinas and the early Medieval thought. Tracing evolution of the doctrine from the 4th to the 8th century he acknowledges political and socio-cultural background, yet he evades reductionism and claims that the process of formulating the Catholic doctrine was powered mostly by fidelity to key dogmas.|$|E

60|$|Yet {{it is not}} {{altogether}} improbable that in the Samothracian or Cabeiric mysteries {{the link between the}} Asiatic and Greek popular schemes of mythology lay concealed. Of these mysteries there are conflicting accounts, and, perhaps, there were variations of doctrine in the lapse of ages and intercourse with other systems. But, upon a review of all that is left to us on this subject in the writings of the ancients, we may, I think, make out thus much of an interesting fact,--that 'Cabiri', impliedly at least, meant 'socii, complices,' having a <b>hypostatic</b> or fundamental union with, or relation to, each other; that these mysterious divinities were, ultimately at least, divided into a higher and lower triad; that the lower triad, 'primi quia infimi,' consisted of the old Titanic deities or powers of nature, under the obscure names of 'Axieros, Axiokersos,' and 'Axiokersa,' representing symbolically different modifications of animal desire or material action, such as hunger, thirst, and fire, without consciousness; that the higher triad, 'ultimi quia superiores,' consisted of Jupiter, (Pallas, or Apollo, or Bacchus, or Mercury, mystically called 'Cadmilos') and Venus, representing, as before, the [Greek (transliterated): nous] or reason, the [Greek: logos] or word or communicative power, and the [Greek: eros] or love;-that the 'Cadmilos' or Mercury, the manifested, communicated, or sent, appeared not only in his proper person as second of the higher triad, but also as a mediator between the higher and lower triad, and so there were seven divinities; and, indeed, according to some authorities, it might seem that the 'Cadmilos' acted once as a mediator of the higher, and once of the lower, triad, and that so there were eight Cabeiric divinities. The lower or Titanic powers being subdued, chaos ceased, and creation began in the reign of the divinities of mind and love; but the chaotic gods still existed in the abyss, and the notion of evoking them was the origin, the idea, of the Greek necromancy.|$|E
