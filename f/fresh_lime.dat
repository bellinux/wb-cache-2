500|$|The {{expedition}} {{returned to}} England in October 1876, {{having failed to}} reach the pole. The gains it had made had not been without cost; three men had died from scurvy alone. One of these deaths had occurred on a sledging party from Alert, the remaining two on Discovery, from which {{there had been no}} major sledging. A Committee of Inquiry investigating the expedition determined a lack of <b>fresh</b> <b>lime</b> juice had triggered the outbreak. Even so, fresh meat, of which there was a plentiful supply near Discovery, could have staved off the disease. Publicly, Nares defended his surgeons, Ninnis included: ...|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{characteristic}} Kelantanese-Thai dish is 'kaeng matsaman'a mouth-watering beef curry cooked with peanuts, potatoes and chopped red onions {{in a thick}} coconut milk sauce. Other Kelantanese-Thai specialties include: 'kaeng phanaeng kai'savoury chicken and coconut curry. 'Kaeng som nom mai dong'hot and sour fish ragout with pickled bamboo. 'Pla see siad haeng thawt'deep fried semi-dried pla see fish. 'Khao yam pak tai'an intriguing breakfast salad. The presentation is exquisite. A small pile of fragrant boiled rice, accompanied by finely chopped heaps of lemon grass, peanuts, bean sprouts, green beans, sour mango and chopped kaffir lime is served with spicy chili pepper, <b>fresh</b> <b>lime</b> and a piquant sweet-sour sauce. It's unusual, elegant, and very typical of Kelantan. Kelantanese dishes, like central Thai, are usually accompanied by generous helpings of 'khao suay', or [...] "beautiful rice"the best of which, 'khao hawm Mali', or jasmine-fragrance rice, is steamed until each grain is tender but separate. When something tastes this good, the Thais utter in full emotion:-"Pisek!" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{secretion}} {{with which}} worms moisten leaves likewise acts on the starch-granules within the cells. My son examined some {{leaves of the}} ash {{and many of the}} lime, which had fallen off the trees and had been partly dragged into worm-burrows. It is known that with fallen leaves the starch-grains are preserved in the guard-cells of the stomata. Now in several cases the starch had partially or wholly disappeared from these cells, in the parts which had been moistened by the secretion; while it was still well preserved in the other parts of the same leaves. Sometimes the starch was dissolved out of only one of the two guard-cells. The nucleus in one case had disappeared, together with the starch-granules. The mere burying of lime-leaves in damp earth for nine days did not cause the destruction of the starch-granules. On the other hand, the immersion of <b>fresh</b> <b>lime</b> and cherry leaves for eighteen hours in artificial pancreatic fluid, led to the dissolution of the starch- granules in the guard-cells {{as well as in the}} other cells.|$|E
