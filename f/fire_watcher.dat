2500|$|His {{father died}} in 1932, leaving debts. His mother, subject to {{neurosis}} and depression, became bedridden and dependent on her son for care. Lowry painted after his mother had fallen asleep, between 10pm and 2am, or, depending how tired he was, he might stay up for another hour adding features. Many paintings produced during this period were damning self-portraits (often {{referred to as the}} [...] "Horrible Heads" [...] series), which demonstrate the influence of expressionism and may have been inspired by an exhibition of Vincent van Gogh's work at Manchester Art Gallery in 1931. He expressed regret that he received little recognition as an artist until the year his mother died and that she was not able to enjoy his success. From the mid-1930s until at least 1939, Lowry took annual holidays at Berwick-upon-Tweed. After the outbreak of war Lowry served as a volunteer <b>fire</b> <b>watcher</b> and became an official war artist in 1943. In 1953, he was appointed Official Artist at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E

50|$|During World War II {{members of}} the Dundry Home Guard had many draughty nights {{on the top of}} the church, on Maes Knoll, and (on Dundry Down) at the {{wireless}} complex watching out for air raids and possible troop landings by parachute and glider. Captain Knight of Walnut Farm, East Dundry served in the First World War and was in charge of the Dundry Home Guard. <b>Fire</b> <b>watchers</b> turned out to watch for fires whenever there were bombing raids. Just south of Rattledown Farm in East Dundry, there was a well-lit dummy town to deflect bombing from Bristol.In 1941, there was a Home Guard exercise for Dundry and neighbouring villages including Winford, Bishopsworth, Leigh Woods and Norton Malreward.|$|R
50|$|Fire Guards (initially {{called the}} Fire Watchers Order in September 1940, then the <b>Fire</b> <b>Watcher</b> Service in January 1941 and then {{reformed}} as the Fire Guard in August 1941) {{were responsible for}} a designated area/building and required to monitor the fall of incendiary bombs and pass on news of any fires that had broken out to the NFS. They could deal with an individual magnesium electron incendiary bomb by dousing them in buckets of sand, water or by smothering.|$|E

The Courtaulds {{remained}} at Eltham until 1944. During the earlier part of the war, Stephen Courtauld {{was a member of the}} local Civil Defence service. In September 1940 he was on duty on the Great Hall roof as a <b>fire</b> <b>watcher</b> when it was badly damaged by German incendiary bombs. In 1944, the Courtauld family moved to Scotland then to Southern Rhodesia, giving the palace to the Royal Army Educational Corps in March 1945; the corps remained there until 1992.|$|E
50|$|During the Second World War the Army's Royal Engineers built a {{range of}} {{buildings}} on top of Beacon Hill that were used by Air Raid Wardens, who acted as <b>fire</b> <b>watchers</b> over the south of Birmingham and Royal Observer Corps aircraft spotters who activated the air raid sirens for Rednal, Rubery, Northfield, the Austin motors factory and the Austin Aero aircraft factory at Cofton Hackett. The range of buildings included a dormitory-rest room block and an open topped toilet range. The latter building, the toilet block still painted in army khaki, was located just {{under the cover of}} the tree line and remained in use by the public as late as the early 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Helmet, Steel, Civilian, Civilian Protective Helmet or Zuckerman helmet: when it {{was found}} {{that a large number of}} civilians were needed to keep a lookout for fires started by {{incendiary}} bombs, an even cheaper mass-produced helmet was required. Designed by a team led by government adviser Solly Zuckerman, the thin mild steel helmet was broadly similar in shape to the military pattern but had a taller crown to the shell, providing space for the helmet to crumple. The simple liner was attached to the shell by a boot lace or string passed through holes in the shell. It was made available to civilian <b>fire</b> <b>watchers</b> at a cost of five shillings and sixpence (27½ new pence) each, starting in December 1940.|$|R
5000|$|St John Zachary (meaning [...] "St John son of St Zachary", i.e. John the Baptist) was a church, first {{mentioned}} in official records in 1181, within the City of London, England, {{on the north}} side of Gresham Street, Aldersgate. [...] Its vicar from May 25, 1424 to an unknown date was William Byngham, the founder of England's first teacher training college [...] It was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and not rebuilt, with its parish being reunited with that of St Anne and St Agnes by Act of Parliament in 1670- an arrangement that lasted until the 20th century. [...] Its site is now a garden first made by the <b>fire</b> <b>watchers</b> in 1941. Partial records survive at IGI.|$|R
50|$|He {{became the}} Overseas Director of the British Oxygen Company {{traveling}} extensively throughout the Middle East, Europe, South Africa and South America to develop business there. He lived at The Mount, Godalming, Surrey.

He then lived in Rolle Cottage, Sidbury and finally Sidmouth both in Devon until his death 16 January 1963. He had two daughters Iris Mary Raikes (born 1 March 1909, died 9 June 1995, living on Exmoor) and Daphne Veronica Raikes, a physiotherapist (born 29 January 1911, and lucidly living to 101 in Beccles, Suffolk, she died 16 October 2012), both without issue.|$|E
5000|$|Dillon {{had long}} been more {{comfortable}} in men's clothing and {{felt that he was}} not truly a woman. In 1939, he sought treatment from Dr. George Foss, who had been experimenting with testosterone to treat excessive menstrual bleeding; at the time, the hormone's masculinizing effects were poorly understood. Foss provided Dillon with testosterone pills but insisted Dillon consult a psychiatrist first, who gossiped about Dillon's desire to become a man, and soon the story was all over town. Dillon fled to Bristol and took a job at a garage. The hormones soon made it possible for him to pass as male, and eventually the garage manager insisted that other employees refer to Dillon as [...] "he" [...] in order to avoid confusing customers. Dillon was promoted to tow truck driver and doubled as a <b>fire</b> <b>watcher</b> during the Blitz.|$|E

50|$|Mukurthi National Park {{is managed}} by the Tamil Nadu Department of Forestry with the main {{objective}} to conserve the endangered shola-grassland ecosystem and its endemic flora and fauna. The department operates an effective year round anti-poaching program with gun- and radio-equipped foot patrols operating from anti-poaching camps at Bangitappal, Nadugani, Western Catchment and Mukurthi Fishing Hut. Prevention and control of destructive wildfire is achieved through creation of artificial firebreaks {{in the form of}} hand-dug fire lines along ridges and cleared trek paths. Local <b>fire</b> <b>watchers</b> are employed for early detection and control during the dangerous December to April fire season. Invasive imported plant species, especially wattle, Scotch broom and gorse are controlled and eliminated from the park through a phased, long-term program focused on restoration of the original biota.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} {{church was}} built to the designs of George Taylor of Coventry, as a chapel of ease to Holy Trinity Church, Coventry and consecrated on 29 September 1874 by Henry Philpott, the Bishop of Worcester. It comprised a chancel with vestry on the north side, and a nave with the entrance porch at {{the west end of}} the south side. The nave was 68 ft by 30 ft, the chancel 21 ft by 20 ft. There was accommodation for 300 worshippers. The stone font was made by Mr Seager of Coventry. It was destroyed on 19 November 1940 during the Coventry Blitz and four of the <b>fire</b> <b>watchers</b> were killed. The destruction left only one course of stones standing. Some of the people seeking shelter in the church crypt were killed or injured.|$|R
5000|$|Observers at {{this test}} {{produced}} optimistic accounts. The chief of incendiary testing at Dugway wrote: A reasonable number of destructive fires can be started {{in spite of}} the extremely small size of the units. The main advantage of the units would seem to be their placement within the enemy structures without the knowledge of the householder or <b>fire</b> <b>watchers,</b> thus allowing the fire to establish itself before being discovered. The National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) observer stated: [...] "It was concluded that X-Ray is an effective weapon." [...] The Chief Chemist's report stated that, on a weight basis, X-Ray was more effective than the standard incendiary bombs in use at the time: [...] "Expressed in another way, the regular bombs would give probably 167 to 400 fires per bomb load where X-Ray would give 3,625 to 4,748 fires." ...|$|R
50|$|Having {{spent his}} lunch hours {{studying}} by himself in Birmingham Central Library, {{he won a}} scholarship {{at the age of}} 16 to the University of Birmingham. Because his parents believed that a musical career was immoral, they made him leave home and he spent his university time as a <b>fire</b> <b>watcher,</b> living in the fire station, while he studied English literature and music. He began playing the horn. A scholarship to the Royal College of Music to study composition (with Ralph Vaughan Williams and R. O. Morris) and horn (with Frank Probin) followed. Only weeks after starting the course, Probin sent Downes as his deputy on a tour with the London Symphony Orchestra, which continued over the years Downes spent at the College, but on leaving the Royal College he decided that orchestral playing would not be his career. He played in the orchestra at Sadler's Wells in the opening performances of Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes in 1945, and at Covent Garden in ballet performances (The Sleeping Beauty) in 1946, while still at the Royal College of Music. He also played for the orchestra of the San Carlo Opera Company.|$|E
5000|$|In 1971, Butters {{graduated}} from Ben Lomond High School in Ogden, Utah. She {{worked at a}} short-lived secretarial job until she could find outdoor work. In 1972, Butters took {{a job in a}} mountaintop lookout tower in Weippe, Idaho, as a Clearwater-Potlatch Timber Protective Association <b>fire</b> <b>watcher.</b> When her job ended, she enrolled in the forestry program at Utah State University, but walked {{out in the middle of}} her art history course, never to return. In 1974, Butters became one of three women to be the first female wilderness rangers in the U.S., and she maintained trails and cleaned sheepherder camps in the Uinta Mountains of northern Utah. After that summer, she earned her carpentry proficiency certificate and was hired as the only woman on a crew building houses at Hill Air Force Base. Early in 1976, Butters became the first woman station guard at the Moose Creek Ranger Station, the most remote Forest Service District in the continental U.S. It was here that Butters met Emil Keck, the legendary fire-control officer and construction-crew chief who lived at the wilderness station year round. Keck became her mentor and the namesake for her second child. Butters has said of Keck, “He taught me how to work hard, and how to make work my life.” ...|$|E
40|$|All three sculptors were greatly {{affected}} by their experiences during the Second World War. Nemon and Belsky came as refuges to Britain before {{the outbreak of}} war and felt they owed the country a singular debt of gratitude. Roberts-Jones and Belsky served in the British Army while Nemon was an ARP Warden and <b>Fire</b> <b>Watcher.</b> This paper will explore the post-war sculpture all three produced which celebrated senior British political and military figures - 'Titans who cast a long shadow' according to Roberts-Jones - who were key to the nation's war effort. Works by Roberts-Jones and Nemon depicting Winston Churchill are well-known but this paper will also touch on statues in London which are, perhaps, less familiar such as Roberts-Jones's 'Field Marshal Slim' (1988 - 90) and 'Field Marshal Alanbrooke'(1990 - 93) on Whitehall, Belsky's 'Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Cunningham' in Trafalgar Square (1966 - 67) and Nemon's 'Air Chief Marshal Portal' on Victoria Embankment (1974 - 75). The paper will also comment on the rivalry that existed between the three men, they often competed for the same commissions, with Roberts-Jones a touch resentful that his 'foreign' competitors appeared to receive such support from the British Establishment...|$|E

50|$|Conservation {{measures}} in force in the sanctuary are {{in the form of}} patrolling on foot and in jeeps, and functioning of 11 moving anti-poaching camps; two permanent camps have been proposed. Drinking water to wild animals are provided through building of water conservation structures. Fire lines are cut and burnt well in advance before the beginning of the forest fire season; fire lines are created and dry material burnt. <b>Fire</b> <b>watchers</b> are stationed at strategic locations. A 10-year conservation plan for the period 2006-16 has been instituted. Zoning of forest into Core, Buffer, and Tourism zones has been planned. The tourism zone has four specific areas - Bheemeshwari and Muthathi, Sangam and Mekedatu in theKanakapura Wildlife Range, Gopinatham and Hogenakal falls of M.M.Hills Wildlife Range. Administrative set up has been proposed to be reorganized with additional staff. Improvement of patrolling paths has been envisaged. To increase awareness among the general public publicity pamphlets are planned, apart from fixing signages and plaques with information on the importance of preservation of wildlife of the sanctuary.|$|R
5000|$|The present alleys {{only give}} a vague {{glimpse of the}} {{appearance}} of the medieval city where the gables of the building were facing the streets and contained window bays for offering goods of sale; where filth, the bumpy paving and hand-drawn vehicles made walking circumstantial; and where odours and scents from dung, food, fishes, leather, furnaces, and seasonal spices mingled. During nights (and certainly during the long winters) the city was completely dark, save for exceptional <b>fire</b> <b>watchers</b> and nocturnal ramblers who used torches to find their bearing. Neither were there any street signs guiding foreigners as no streets were officially named, instead referred to as [...] "the thoroughfare running from the outer southern gate and up to the cross and the chapel" [...] or constantly renamed after the most prominent person settled in an exposed part of the alley. Indeed, historical records contain many examples of obscure references to locations in the city, close to impossible to pin down as some streets have been renamed dozens of times, often carrying the same or a similar name as other streets before physically ceasing to exist.|$|R
50|$|The {{difficulty}} of solely targeting Barrow's shipyard meant that many residential neighbourhoods were bombed instead; 83 civilians were killed, 330 injured, and over 10,000 houses were {{damaged or destroyed}} during the Blitz, about 25 percent of the town's housing stock. Surrounding towns and villages were often mistaken for Barrow and were attacked instead, while many streets in Barrow were severely damaged. Bombing during mid-April 1941 caused significant damage to a central portion of Abbey Road, completely destroying the Waverley Hotel as well as Christ Church and the Abbey Road Baptist Church. The town's main public baths and Essoldo Theatre were also severely damaged, however they were repaired within years. Hawcoat Lane is a street that is most noted for taking a direct destructive hit in early May 1941. Barrow {{has been described as}} somewhat unprepared for the Blitz, as there were only enough public shelters for 5 percent of the town's population; some people who lived in the town centre were even forced to seek refuge in hedgerows on the outskirts of Barrow. This shortage of shelters was believed to have led to excessively high casualties. Two <b>fire</b> <b>watchers</b> were killed in May 1941 when the hammer head crane they were stationed in at Vickers Shipyard was bombed by the Luftwaffe.|$|R
50|$|Five marked trails {{comprise}} 4.5 miles (7.0 km) {{of hiking}} opportunities that cross and recross Big Creek. At {{the north end}} of the conservation area, a recreational complex includes a picnic shelter, playground, and <b>fire</b> ring.

The conservation area is maintained by the Macon County Conservation District.|$|R
60|$|As Sir Bindon Blood and his escort {{approached}} {{the top of}} the pass, a few shots were <b>fired</b> by the <b>watchers</b> there, but there was no opposition. All the Bunerwals had hurried over to defend the southern entrances to their country, which they conceived were in danger of attack from Brigadier-General Wodehouse's force at Rustum. The general reached the Kotal, and saw the whole valley beneath him. Great villages dotted the plains and the aspect was fertile and prosperous.|$|R
6000|$|His grasp {{had become}} convulsive in its force, and Deronda, {{agitated}} {{as he had}} never been before--the certainty that this was Mirah's brother suffusing his own strange relation to Mordecai with a new solemnity and tenderness--felt his strong young heart beating faster and his lips paling. He shrank from speech. He feared, in Mordecai's present state of exaltation (already an alarming strain on his feeble frame), to utter a word of revelation about Mirah. He feared to make an answer below that high pitch of expectation which resembled a flash from a dying <b>fire,</b> making <b>watchers</b> fear to see it die the faster. His dominant impulse was to do as he had once done before: he laid his firm, gentle hand on the hand that grasped him. Mordecai's, as if it had a soul of its own--for he was not distinctly willing to do what he did--relaxed its grasp, and turned upward under Deronda's. As the two palms met and pressed each other Mordecai recovered some sense of his surroundings, and said-- ...|$|R
2500|$|Wesley is {{introduced}} in Angel having been <b>fired</b> from the <b>Watcher's</b> Council. Denisof says the experience gave the character [...] "a little shake". He elaborates, When {{he arrived in}} Sunnydale, he was straight out of Watcher grad school; he lacked practical experience. He {{was living in the}} ideal of the perfect way to execute his duties. I think that losing his job and going out alone roughened him up a little, lopped off some of his sharper corners. It made him more approachable and more personable, less sure of himself all the time. [...] Coming into the show immediately following the death of Doyle, Wesley serves as a partial replacement for that character. Comparing the two characters, Denisof states, [...] "Wesley is a clearer counterpart to Angel, whereas Doyle had more street smarts. Although [...] was struggling with his demon nature, he had seen a lot more of the world in the same way Angel had." [...] Nonetheless Denisof believes that in this period, his character [...] "was so anxious to be a tough rogue demon hunter but was clearly a kind of soft puppy dog." ...|$|R
