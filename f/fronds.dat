5|$|This fern was {{at first}} {{identified}} by André Michaux, in 1803, as black spleenwort (Asplenium adiantum-nigrum). Carl Ludwig Willdenow recognized and {{described it as a}} separate species, which he named Asplenium montanum, in 1810. In 1901, John A. Shafer attempted to transfer it to the genus Athyrium as Athyrium montanum, but this name is illegitimate as a later homonym of Athyrium montanum (Lam.) Röhl. ex Spreng. The species was segregated from Asplenium as Chamaefilix montana by Oliver Atkins Farwell in 1931. The change was not widely accepted and current authorities do not recognize this segregate genus. In 1974, Timothy Reeves described an unusual population of A.montanum from the Shawangunk Mountains. Having used chromatography to show {{that it was not a}} hybrid, he interpreted it as a new form, Asplenium montanum forma shawangunkense. In this form, as contrasted with the usual forma montanum, the leaf blade is yellow-green, the <b>fronds</b> continue highly dissected to the apex and do not come to a pointed tip, the <b>fronds</b> are shorter and more highly dissected than usual, and all <b>fronds</b> are sterile.|$|E
5|$|Aspleniummontanum is a small, {{evergreen}} fern which {{grows in}} tufts. The leaves are bluish-green and highly divided, proceeding {{from a long}} and often drooping stalk. A.montanum is monomorphic, with no difference in form between sterile and fertile <b>fronds.</b>|$|E
5|$|On fertile <b>fronds,</b> from 1 to 15 {{elliptical}} or narrow sori can {{be found}} on the underside of each pinna. They are 0.5 to 1.5millimeters long, covered by translucent, pale tan indusia with somewhat jagged edges. Each sporangium holds 64 spores. The species has a chromosome number of 2n = 72 in the sporophyte; it is a diploid.|$|E
5000|$|Drynaria roosii is an epiphytic (growing on trees) or epipetric (growing on rocks) plant. Like {{other species}} of Drynaria, they possess two <b>frond</b> types [...] - [...] a fertile foliage <b>frond</b> and a sterile nest <b>frond.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{plant is}} unique among the moonworts. While other species {{generally}} produce one fertile <b>frond</b> and one sterile, this species produces only the fertile <b>frond.</b> This <b>frond</b> has two segments, both bearing spores. The plant grows up to 15 centimeters tall. As the leaflike sterile <b>frond</b> is absent, the plant likely obtains {{much of its}} energy from mycorrhizae instead of photosynthesis.|$|R
40|$|Physical and {{mechanical}} properties of palm <b>frond</b> {{are very important}} factor {{for the development of}} palm oil waste utilization technology. The objective of this research was to determine mechanical properties of palm <b>frond</b> <b>Frond</b> for Chopper Machine Designing. The research of composting conduct with two composting factor combination, namely: composting starter composition (i. e. Bokashi, vermi-compost and natural composting) and piece of <b>frond</b> dimension (2 cm, 4 cm, and 6 cm). Sample was obtained from 5 years and 20 years palm oil trees. The average length of palm <b>frond</b> was 675. 89 cm, average leaflet length at the palm <b>frond</b> base was 103. 89 cm and average leaflet length at palm <b>frond</b> tip was 23. 83 cm. Maximum compression strength at the 20 years-palm <b>frond</b> base was 8134. 62 N and at the 5 years-palm midrib base was 4893. 52 N. Maximum force requirement for cutting palm leaf was 67. 67 N. The composting process indicates that Bokashi starter composition gives higher percentage of mass reduction on all variant of piece of <b>frond</b> dimension. Smaller piece of <b>frond</b> (2 cm) enable the composting process quicker and had a better result. Statistical analysis reveals that combination of composting factors have significant effect on C/N ratio but insignificant on NPK content...|$|R
5|$|The greater Phoenix {{region is}} home to the only {{thriving}} feral population of rosy-faced lovebirds in the U.S. This bird is a popular birdcage pet, native to southwestern Africa. Feral birds were first observed living outdoors in 1987, probably escaped or released pets, and by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about 950 birds. These lovebirds prefer older neighborhoods where they nest under untrimmed, dead palm tree <b>fronds.</b>|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, Frank {{began to}} find that Judy was more {{aggressive}} towards the Japanese and Korean guards. Although he'd normally send her into the jungle to avoid them, on one occasion, the guards gave chase and shot at the dog. He later found Judy bleeding from the shoulder {{where she had been}} grazed by the bullet. He covered the wound with some palm <b>fronds,</b> but could do nothing else to treat or reward her. After moving camps once more, Judy was sentenced to death by the Japanese as part of a plan to control a lice breakout. She disappeared for three days, with guards conducting sweeps in an attempt to find her. She only reappeared when the Japanese forces abandoned the camp.|$|E
5|$|Six {{sets were}} {{constructed}} on which 60 pounds of baking soda {{were used as}} snow (the crew tried to use real snow but it melted), 42 pounds of glitter were used to cover the background, and 20 boxes of breakfast cereal were used to cover the coral rocks. Over 38 different types of foam were {{used to make the}} set pieces and the characters' bodies and heads. To render SpongeBob's pineapple house, palm <b>fronds</b> from a tree in a school yard were used. Other props and materials used were an actual starfish, three Christmas trees (for the Patchy the Pirate's Winter Wonderland scenes), six boxes of puff cereal (to create the fruitcake inside SpongeBob's mouth), 21 pounds of googly eyes (for rivets, texture pieces, knobs, etc.), 22 pounds of woodchips (to create Sandy's treedome floor), and 24 bunches of craft flowers (to create the parade float).|$|E
50|$|Charniodiscus is an Ediacaran fossil that in {{life was}} {{probably}} a stationary filter feeder that lived anchored to a sandy sea bed. The organism had a holdfast, stalk and <b>frond.</b> The holdfast was bulbous shaped, and the stalk was flexible. The <b>frond</b> was segmented and had a pointed tip. There were two growth forms: one with a short stem and fat <b>frond,</b> and another with a long stalk, elevating a smaller <b>frond</b> about 50 cm above the holdfast. While the organism superficially resembles the sea pens (cnidaria), it is probably not a crown-group animal.|$|R

5|$|The Sunda slow loris is nocturnal and arboreal, {{typically}} {{occurring in}} evergreen forests. It prefers rainforests with continuous dense canopies {{and has an}} extremely low metabolic rate compared to other mammals of its size. Its diet consists of sap, floral nectar, fruit and arthropods. It will feed on exudates such as gum and sap by licking wounds in trees. The species is generally solitary; one study showed only 8% of its active time was spent near other individuals. Social behavior makes up a very {{small part of the}} activity budget, though it has monogamous mating system with the offspring living with the parents. It sleeps during the day, rolled up in a ball in hidden parts of trees above the ground, often on branches, twigs, palm <b>fronds,</b> or lianas. The species is polyoestrous, usually giving birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of 192 days. The young disperses between 16 and 27 months, generally when it is sexually mature.|$|E
5|$|Asplenium bradleyi {{is similar}} to two hybrid species {{of which it is}} a parent, Graves' spleenwort (A.×gravesii), a hybrid with A.pinnatifidum, and Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a {{backcross}} with A.montanum. In A.×gravesii, the dark color of the stipe ends {{at the base of the}} leaf blade, the pinnae are more shallowly lobed and the enlargement of acroscopic lobes or pinnules is less distinct, and the apical portion of the blade forms a long, tapering tip with slight lobes (as in A.pinnatifidum), rather than being cut into pinnae. In addition to the general reduction of the toothiness of A.bradleyi, A.×gravesii also shows faint winging along the stipe. Likewise, in A.×wherryi, the dark color of the stipe again ends at the base of the leaf blade, the overall shape of the blade tends to be more distinctly lance-shaped, and the <b>fronds</b> are somewhat more deeply cut than A.bradleyi, progressing from bipinnate in the lower half to pinnate-pinnatifid and finally pinnate at the apex. Finally, the diploid hybrid A.montanum × platyneuron, from which A.bradleyi arose by chromosome doubling, is essentially identical in appearance to A.bradleyi. On close examination, its spores are found to be abortive, and the sori are smaller and not do not become fused with each other as they grow, as they do in fertile A.bradleyi.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men torch fish. Torch fishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut <b>fronds</b> to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch fishing season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the fishing season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E

40|$|The PCR primer GanET has {{previously}} {{been shown to be}} suitable for the specific amplification of DNA from Ganoderma boninense. A DNA extraction and PCR method has been developed that allows for the amplification of the G. boninense DNA from environmental samples of oil palm tissue. The GanET primer reaction was used in conjunction with a palm-sampling programme to investigate the possible infection of young palms through cut <b>frond</b> base surfaces. Ganoderma DNA was detected in <b>frond</b> base material at a greater frequency than would be expected by comparison with current infection levels. Comparisons are made between the height of the <b>frond</b> base infected, the number of <b>frond</b> bases infected, and subsequent development of basal stem rot.

5|$|Plant {{material}} {{makes up}} the majority of most lemur diets. Members of at least 109 of all known plant families in Madagascar (55%) are exploited by lemurs. Since lemurs are primarily arboreal, most of these exploited species are woody plants, including trees, shrubs, or lianas. Only the ring-tailed lemur, the bamboo lemurs (genus Hapalemur), and the black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata) are known to consume herbs. While Madagascar is rich in fern diversity, these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs. One possible {{reason for this is that}} ferns lack flowers, fruits, and seeds—common food items in lemur diets. They also occur close to the ground, while lemurs spend most of their time in the trees. Lastly, ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of tannins in their <b>fronds.</b> Likewise, mangroves appear to be rarely exploited by lemurs due to their high tannin content. Some lemurs appear to have evolved responses against common plant defenses, however, such as tannins and alkaloids. The golden bamboo lemur (Hapalemur aureus), for instance, eats giant bamboo (Cathariostachys madagascariensis), which contains high levels of cyanide. This lemur can consume twelve times the typically lethal dose for most mammals on a daily basis; the physiological mechanisms that protect it from cyanide poisoning are unknown. At the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in the United States, lemurs that roam the outdoor enclosures have been observed eating poison ivy (Taxicodendron radicans), yet have shown no ill effects.|$|E

40|$|The pathway {{from the}} {{intercalary}} <b>frond</b> meristem to distal <b>frond</b> portions was blocked in experimental sporophytes of Laminaria digitata in January by cutting 2 or 3 holes (15 - 25 mm diameter) 5 cm {{from the base}} of the <b>frond.</b> This procedure resulted in the formation of sori within 5 - 10 weeks adjacent to the distal edge of the holes. <b>Frond</b> portions that were cut at least 20 cm away from the stipe-frond transition readily formed sori within 5 - 7 weeks after isolation from the rest of the thallus. These findings suggest that the basal, actively dividing and expanding part of the laminarian <b>frond</b> is the source of inhibitors of sporangium formation which move in a distal direction and keep the young <b>frond</b> free of sori during the season of rapid growth, i. e. during the first part of the year.

40|$|During initial {{exposure}} to 40 nanomolar propargylglycine (PAG), Lemna paucicostata colonies undergo abnormal fragmentation and a lag in <b>frond</b> emergence, most severe at 24 to 48 hours. Thereafter, <b>frond</b> emergence resumes and the frond/colony ratio rises. Such `adapted' plants withstand subculture {{into the same}} concentration of PAG without fragmentation or decreases in <b>frond</b> emergence, and display enhanced tolerance to higher concentrations. Adaptation is not dependent upon outgrowth of a few preexisting especially tolerant plants. Exogenous methionine prevents these events and overcomes the PAG-induced lag in <b>frond</b> emergence even after it is underway. These changes in <b>frond</b> emergence are not reflected in the rates of protein and wet weight accumulation which decrease by about 25 % during the first 24 hours and continue unchanged thereafter.
