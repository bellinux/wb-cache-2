5|$|According to {{a survey}} of the British Association for the Advancement of Science Boltonians are the friendliest people in Britain. Humphrey Spender photographed Bolton calling it Worktown for the Mass-Observation Project, a social {{research}} organisation which aimed to record everyday life in Britain. <b>His</b> <b>photographs</b> provide a record of ordinary people living and working in a British pre-War industrial town.|$|E
5|$|As the Hood {{has managed}} to evade the authorities, Scott leaves him to IR's London agent, Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward (Sylvia Anderson). Chasing the enemy in their specially-modified Rolls-Royce, FAB 1, Penelope and her butler, Parker (Graham), blast him off the {{motorway}} using the car's front-mounted machine gun. Although the Hood survives the encounter, <b>his</b> <b>photographs</b> are destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Brooks was {{the first}} and the longest-serving of the British war photographers, and took more than 4,400 images. This was the most of any {{individual}} photographer, and represented more than 10% of all the official photographs. A large collection of <b>his</b> <b>photographs</b> is now held by the Imperial War Museum, and a second collection is held by the National Library of Scotland as part of Earl Haig's papers; both have been digitised.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{innovations}} of Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried, Farsari {{further developed the}} trade in photograph albums. His studio generally produced sepia monochrome albumen prints that were hand-coloured and mounted on album leaves. These pages were often hand decorated and bound between covers of silk brocade or lacquer boards inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl and gold. Like his contemporaries, Farsari usually captioned and numbered <b>his</b> <b>photographs</b> in the images, often in white lettering on a black background.|$|E
5|$|Grant was on {{assignment}} in November 1963 to cover President John F. Kennedy's trip from Washington, D.C., to Dallas. One of <b>his</b> <b>photographs</b> made {{the front page}} of the November 22 edition of the Morning News; a copy is believed to be the last thing Kennedy ever signed. Grant also would make several pictures at Parkland Memorial Hospital within minutes after Kennedy's motorcade arrived following the shooting in Dealey Plaza.|$|E

5|$|Henschel {{became known}} for making {{pictorial}} representations of Rio de Janeiro as a landscaper photographer and {{for being an}} excellent portraitist. He earned the title of Photographo da Casa Imperial (Photographer of the Royal House), allowing him to photograph the everyday life of the Brazilian monarchy during the Reign of Pedro II, even photographing the emperor Dom Pedro II and his family. This title would give <b>his</b> <b>photographs</b> increased recognition and raise their price.|$|E
5|$|Kertész {{worked in}} the {{settings}} of many famous homes and notable places, as well as overseas, where he traveled again in England, Budapest and Paris, renewing friendships and making new ones. During the 1945–62 period at House and Garden, the magazine published more than 3,000 of <b>his</b> <b>photographs,</b> and he created a high reputation in the industry. With little time for his personal work, Kertész felt starved {{of being able to}} exercise more artistic creativity.|$|E
5|$|Much of Ed Westcott's {{photographic}} {{work was}} classified {{when it was}} first created, and some of it remained classified for many years, but access to his work is now largely unrestricted. About 5,000 negatives are archived by the National Archives in Washington, DC. <b>His</b> <b>photographs</b> have been widely reproduced, often without naming him as the photographer, in publications and exhibits about the Manhattan Project.|$|E

5|$|Photographer Ansel Adams {{made his}} first trip to Yosemite in 1916; <b>his</b> <b>photographs</b> of the valley made him famous in the 1920s and 1930s. Adams willed the originals of his Yosemite photos to the Yosemite Park Association, and {{visitors}} can still buy direct prints from his original negatives. The studio in which the prints are sold was established in 1902 by artist Harry Cassie Best.|$|E
5|$|After earning enough money, Kertész quickly {{bought his}} first camera (an ICA box camera) in 1912, despite his family's protests to {{continue}} his career in business. In his free time, he photographed the local peasants, gypsies, and landscape of the surrounding Hungarian Plains (the puszta). His first photograph {{is believed to be}} Sleeping Boy, Budapest, 1912. <b>His</b> <b>photographs</b> were first published in 1917 in the magazine Érdekes Újság, during World War I, while Kertész was serving in the Austro-Hungarian army. As early as 1914 (for example, Eugene, 1914), his distinctive and mature style was already evident.|$|E
5|$|Like other Japanese anime, The Garden of Words {{was created}} using a {{combination}} of hand-drawn animation, rotoscoping and computer animation (CGI), with the latter facilitating the realistic appearance of the film's rain sequences. Shinkai made half of the film's backgrounds by using <b>his</b> <b>photographs</b> as a base and then drawing over the top with Adobe Photoshop, while the other half were fictional settings created with traditional animation and computer graphics. As with his other films, the backgrounds are vivid and meticulously drawn scenery while the characters are drawn with less detail, though they are still convincing and realistic.|$|E

5|$|Mitra had met Ray {{on the set}} of The River, where Mitra {{was allowed}} to observe the production, take {{photographs}} and make notes about lighting for personal reference. Having become friends, Mitra kept Ray informed about the production and showed <b>his</b> <b>photographs.</b> Ray was impressed enough by them to promise him an assistant's position on Pather Panchali, and when production neared, invited him to shoot the film. As the 21-year-old Mitra had no prior filmmaking experience, the choice was met with scepticism by those who knew of the production. Mitra himself later speculated that Ray was nervous about working with an established crew.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{his images}} {{were among the}} photos that were {{distributed}} to news media with {{the announcement of the}} first atomic bomb and the secret project that created it. In the weeks before the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, prints of 18 of <b>his</b> <b>photographs</b> were made in secrecy in preparation for the announcement. The photographs were declassified and distributed as part of the press kit. He also processed film taken by the damage assessment teams in his laboratory in Oak Ridge. It took three days to print them. Armed guards outside the darkroom.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} criticisms of van Kinsbergen's photographs. He missed some details and {{sometimes}} his series was unbalanced. Trained as an artist, his works lacked archaeological descriptions, {{the main purpose}} of his contract. The printing quality, however, is beyond question and he had success showing the beauty of classical Javanese arts. <b>His</b> <b>photographs</b> were shown to the public both in the 1873 International Exhibition in Vienna and the 1878 World Exhibition in Paris. His works can be seen in several places, including the National Museum in Amsterdam.|$|E

5|$|When Meessen {{returned}} to the Netherlands in 1870 he established a short-lived partnership with Abraham Vermeulen and began disseminating <b>his</b> <b>photographs.</b> Selected images were gifted to King William III in an elaborately decorated album in 1871, while more were published by De Bussy in 1875 and exhibited in Paris and Amsterdam. In his final years Meessen worked predominantly as an architect. Collections of his albumen prints, {{some of which were}} hand-tinted or annotated, are held in four institutions in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Beato's {{photographs}} of the Second Opium War {{are the first to}} document a military campaign as it unfolded, doing so through a sequence of dated and related images. <b>His</b> <b>photographs</b> of the Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers. The photographs were not taken in this order, as the {{photographs of}} dead Chinese had to be taken first—before the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts.|$|E
5|$|Elfriede died in October 1970, and Segrè married Rosa Mines in February 1972. That year {{he reached}} the University of California's {{compulsory}} retirement age. He continued teaching the history of physics. In 1974 {{he returned to the}} University of Rome as a professor, but served only a year before reaching the mandatory retirement age. Segrè died from a heart attack at the age of 84 while out walking near his home in Lafayette. Active as a photographer, Segrè took many photos documenting events and people in the history of modern science. After his death Rosa donated many of <b>his</b> <b>photographs</b> to the American Institute of Physics, which named its photographic archive of physics history in his honor. The collection was bolstered by a subsequent bequest from Rosa after her death from an accident in Tivoli in 1997.|$|E
