Four major banks — Citibank, Chase Bank, Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover — offered <b>home</b> <b>banking</b> services. Chemical introduced its Pronto services for individuals and small businesses in 1983, which enabled individual and small-business clients to maintain electronic checkbook registers, see account balances, and transfer funds between checking and savings accounts. Pronto failed to attract enough customers to break even and was abandoned in 1989. Other banks had a similar experience.|$|E
25|$|The {{precursor}} for {{the modern}} home loan banking services were the distance banking services over electronic media from the early 1980s. The term 'online' became popular in the late 1980s and referred {{to the use of}} a terminal, keyboard and TV (or monitor) to access the banking system using a phone line. 'Home banking' can also refer to the use of a numeric keypad to send tones down a phone line with instructions to the bank. Online services started in New York in 1981 when four of the city's major banks (Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover) offered <b>home</b> <b>banking</b> services. using the videotex system. Because of the commercial failure of videotex these banking services never became popular except in France where the use of videotex (Minitel) was subsidised by the telecom provider and the UK, where the Prestel system was used.|$|E

60|$|Banking in {{a country}} {{undergoing}} so rapid and vigorous an economic development as Italy {{is very different from}} the banking we simple English know of at <b>home.</b> <b>Banking</b> in England, like land-owning, has hitherto been a sort of hold up. There were always borrowers, there were always tenants, and all that had to be done was to refuse, obstruct, delay and worry the helpless borrower or would-be tenant until the maximum of security and profit was obtained. I have never borrowed but I have built, and I know something of the extreme hauteur of property of England towards a man who wants to do anything with land, and with money I gather the case is just the same. But in Italy, which already possessed a sunny prosperity of its own upon mediaeval lines, the banker has had to be suggestive and persuasive, sympathetic and helpful. These are unaccustomed attitudes for British capital. The field has been far more attractive to the German banker, who is less of a proudly impassive usurer and more of a partner, who demands less than absolute security because he investigates more industriously and intelligently. This great bank, the Banca Commerciale Italiana, is a bank of the German type: to begin with, it was certainly dominated by German directors; it was a bank of stimulation, and its activities interweave now into the whole fabric of Italian commercial life. But it has already liberated itself from German influence, and the bulk of its capital is Italian. Nevertheless I found discussion ranging about firstly what the Banca Commerciale essentially was, secondly what it might become, thirdly what it might do, and fourthly what, if anything, had to be done to it.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{importance}} of relationship lending in the credit card market. Credit bureaus are {{the major source of}} information for banks in their card approval and pricing processes. They collect information primarily on the debt side of a consumer’s portfolio rather than on a consumer’s assets. However, the latter private information is available to a “home bank ” with which the consumer has other financial dealings. We test whether <b>home</b> <b>banks</b> are using this private information to make lower interest offers to their own customers who are good credit risks. An endogenous switching regression model incorporating the self-selection of consumers to use a <b>home</b> <b>bank</b> card versus an external bank card is used. The results show that <b>home</b> <b>banks</b> are able to make lower interest offers to their internal customers whose default risks are lower, and this has contributed to interest rate heterogeneity in the credit card market. In addition, we test whether <b>home</b> <b>banks</b> are able to extract information monopoly rents from the low credit risks, but find no evidence of rents in this market...|$|R
