5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise <b>in</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E
5|$|In the 9th {{century the}} Polish lands {{were still on}} the {{peripheries}} of medieval Europe as regards its major powers and events, but a measure of progress did take place <b>in</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> civilization, as evidenced by the number of gords built, kurgans raised and movable equipment used. The tribal elites must have been influenced by the relative closeness of the Carolingian Empire; objects crafted there have occasionally been found. Poland was populated by many tribes of various sizes. The names of some of them, mostly from {{the western part of the}} country, are known from written sources, especially a Latin document written in the mid-9th century by the anonymous Bavarian Geographer. During this period, smaller tribal structures were disintegrating while larger ones were being established in their place.|$|E

5|$|Locusts are the {{swarming}} {{phase of}} certain species of short-horned grasshoppers {{in the family}} Acrididae. Swarming behaviour {{is a response to}} overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase <b>in</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> serotonin. This causes the grasshopper to change colour, feed more and breed faster. The transformation of a solitary individual into a swarming one is induced by several contacts per minute over a short period.|$|E
5|$|Swarming {{behaviour}} is {{a response}} to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase <b>in</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> serotonin. This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The transformation of the locust to the swarming form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. A large swarm can consist of billions of locusts spread out over an area of thousands of square kilometres, with a population of up to 80 million individuals per square kilometre (200 million per square mile). When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release serotonin, which causes them to become mutually attracted, a prerequisite for swarming.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{cellular}} signals activating the SOS response are regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), arising from stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks, which are processed by DNA helicase {{to separate the}} two DNA strands. In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA–ssDNA filaments. RecA–ssDNA filaments activate LexA autoprotease activity, which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation. The loss of LexA repressor induces transcription of the SOS genes and allows for further signal induction, inhibition of cell division and an increase <b>in</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> proteins responsible for damage processing.|$|E

5|$|These {{laboratory}} tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute {{phase of the}} illness {{with the exception of}} serology. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types IgG and IgM, can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest levels (titres) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in reinfection. IgM becomes undetectable 30–90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection, IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus. In testing for IgG and IgM antibodies there may be cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses which may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or Japanese encephalitis. The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase <b>in</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.|$|E

40|$|Objectives This study {{evaluates the}} effects of the group course Head Up, which was {{developed}} for adolescents (13 - 17 years) with elevated <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> depressive symptoms. Effects on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> depressive symptoms were examined. Using a quasi-experimental pre- to post-test design, 12 adolescents received the group course and 16 adolescents were in the comparison group. Secondly, this study explored the stability of depressive symptoms in a normative sample of 153 adolescents (13 - 16 years). Results There was a great decrease <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> depressive symptoms from pre- to post-test for the course group (p <. 01) {{as well as for the}} comparison group (p <. 01) but there were no significant differences between the course group and comparison group <b>in</b> the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> decrease of depressive symptoms (p <. 07). In the normative sample there was also an overall decrease <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> depressive symptoms (p <. 001) and there was a moderate stability (κ =. 49, p <. 01) <b>of</b> ‘having elevated <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> depressive symptoms or not’ over a period of 8 - 12 weeks. Conclusion Although there were no significant differences between the course group and the comparison group <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> decrease of depressive symptoms, there is a trend in favor of the course group. Future research in {{the effects of}} Head Up with a bigger and randomized course- and control group is recommended. Furthermore, this study found a strong overall decrease <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> depressive symptoms and a strong relative stability of depressive symptoms in a normative sample of adolescents, measured with the BDI-II. It is unclear what caused the strong overall decrease in depressive symptoms; future research should investigate if the same decrease is shown when using other measurements of depression...|$|R
