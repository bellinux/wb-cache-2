5|$|Ancient <b>Egypt</b> was {{a civilization}} of ancient Northeastern Africa, {{concentrated}} along the lower {{reaches of the}} Nile River in the place that is now the country <b>Egypt.</b> It is one of six historic civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric <b>Egypt</b> and coalesced around 3150BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower <b>Egypt</b> under Menes (often identified with Narmer). The history of ancient <b>Egypt</b> occurred {{as a series of}} stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|<b>Egypt</b> {{reached the}} {{pinnacle}} of its power in the New Kingdom, during the Ramesside period, where it rivalled the Hittite Empire, Assyrian Empire and Mitanni Empire, after which it entered a period of slow decline. <b>Egypt</b> was invaded or conquered by a succession of foreign powers, such as the Canaanites/Hyksos, Libyans, the Nubians, the Assyrians, Babylonians, the Achaemenid Persians, and the Macedonians in the Third Intermediate Period and the Late Period of <b>Egypt.</b> In the aftermath of Alexander the Great's death, one of his generals, Ptolemy Soter, established himself as the new ruler of <b>Egypt.</b> This Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom ruled <b>Egypt</b> until 30BC, when, under Cleopatra, it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province.|$|E

5|$|General Sir Archibald Murray, the {{commander}} of the British Empire forces in <b>Egypt,</b> formed the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) in March 1916 by merging the Force in <b>Egypt,</b> which had protected <b>Egypt</b> {{since the beginning of the}} war, with the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force which had fought at Gallipoli.

5|$|In <b>Egypt,</b> {{there were}} large {{communities}} of Coptic Christians, Melkites, Turks, Armenians, and Black Africans—the latter two groups {{had a large}} presence in Upper <b>Egypt.</b> Under the Fatimids, non-Muslims in <b>Egypt</b> generally prospered, {{with the exception of}} Caliph al-Hakim's reign. However, with Shirkuh's ascendancy to the vizier position, a number edicts were enacted against the non-Muslim population. With the advent of the Syrian expeditionary force (consisting of Oghuz Turks and Kurds) into <b>Egypt,</b> waves of maltreatment of minorities occurred, irrespective of religion. These incidents occurred while Shirkuh and Saladin were viziers to the Fatimid caliph.|$|E

5|$|After resigning {{from the}} AHC, Darwaza {{spent the rest}} of his life in the modern state of Syria where he left {{politics}} to concentrate on literature. Although he did much of his writing in the 1930s and 1940s, he did not have any of his works published until the 1960s. As a pan-Arab intellectual, Darwaza aided in establishing the union between Syria and <b>Egypt</b> forming the short-lived United Arab Republic. After <b>Egypt</b> adopted its 1956 constitution declaring that it was an Arab country and its people a part of the Arab nation, Darwaza concluded that <b>Egypt</b> and Syria were in a position to unite. When unity negotiations underwent, he suggested several forms of federation, such as the American, Soviet, and Indian models, but did not recommend any specific model for an Arab state. Darwaza did, however, suggest that the institution of a federation between <b>Egypt</b> and Syria would be the first step towards the realization of a comprehensive union.|$|E

5|$|Amalric {{had come}} to power in 1164 and had made it his goal to conquer <b>Egypt.</b> <b>Egypt</b> had been invaded by King Baldwin I fifty years earlier, and the weak Fatimid Caliphate was forced to pay yearly tribute to Jerusalem. Amalric turned towards <b>Egypt</b> because Muslim {{territory}} {{to the east of}} Jerusalem had fallen {{under the control of the}} powerful Zengid sultan Nur ad-Din. Nur ad-Din had taken control of Damascus in 1154, six years after the disastrous siege of Damascus by the Second Crusade in 1148. Jerusalem could now expand only to the southwest, towards <b>Egypt,</b> and in 1153 Ascalon, the last Fatimid outpost in Palestine, fell to the crusaders. Nur ad-Din, however, also wished to acquire <b>Egypt,</b> and sent his army to hinder Amalric's plans. This was the situation in the east when William returned from Europe. In 1167 Amalric married Maria Comnena, grand-niece of Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus, and in 1168 the king sent William to finalize a treaty for a joint Byzantine-crusader campaign against <b>Egypt.</b> The expedition, Amalric's fourth, was the first with support from the Byzantine navy. Amalric, however, did not wait for the fleet to arrive. He managed to capture Damietta, but within a few years he was expelled from <b>Egypt</b> by one of Nur ad-Din's generals, Saladin, who would later become Jerusalem's greatest threat.|$|E

5|$|At {{a session}} of the Arab League's Joint Defence Council on January 27–30, 1973, <b>Egypt</b> {{presented}} a report stressing that an attack against Israel {{would have to be}} carried out simultaneously from <b>Egypt,</b> Syria and Jordan because of the Israeli air superiority. According to the report, <b>Egypt</b> and Syria's air forces, if reinforced with 16 air squadrons from other Arab countries would achieve numerical superiority. However, the Israelis offset this by superior training, avionics, aircraft payload and weaponry. A simultaneous Arab attack could dilute the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), and would force Israeli ground forces to fight a two-front war.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin III finally seized Ascalon in 1153, {{which brought}} <b>Egypt</b> into {{the sphere of}} conflict.

However, relations with the Byzantine Empire were mixed, and reinforcements from Europe were sparse after the disaster of the Second Crusade. King Amalric I of Jerusalem allied with the Byzantines and participated in a combined invasion of <b>Egypt</b> in 1169, but the expedition ultimately failed. In 1171, Saladin, nephew of one of Nur ad-Din's generals, was proclaimed Sultan of <b>Egypt,</b> uniting <b>Egypt</b> and Syria and completely surrounding the crusader kingdom. Meanwhile, the Byzantine alliance ended with the death of emperor Manuel I in 1180, and in 1187, Jerusalem capitulated to Saladin.
