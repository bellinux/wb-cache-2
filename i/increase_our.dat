25|$|It {{is common}} to assume that {{buildings}} are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies {{that there is little}} interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see {{the overwhelming majority of the}} mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help <b>increase</b> <b>our</b> understanding. “Building ecology “ is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.|$|E

500|$|The Task Force began {{night flight}} {{training}} using night vision goggles (NVG) to develop nighttime extraction capabilities; however, {{they were doing}} so with AN/PVS-5 NVGs which were originally developed for ground forces. Never before had anyone in the U.S. Department of Defense flown in NVGs and the Task Force quickly adapted the NVGs for flying and by Brown's own words [...] "a warrant officer figured out we could cut them apart and mount them to our helmets and <b>increase</b> <b>our</b> efficiency and safety by a huge margin. So there we were, without authority, cutting up goggles and building our own NVGs." [...] Their nighttime training took place at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah.

500|$|In November 2011, in the Tucson, Arizona, market, Belo relinquished the {{operations}} of its Fox and MyNetworkTV duopoly KMSB and KTTU to Raycom Media. Operations of the two stations, along with production of KMSB's 9:00p.m. newscast, were assumed by Raycom's CBS station KOLD-TV. Belo Media Operations president Peter L. Diaz touted that the consolidation would result in [...] "better produced, increased news programming for the Tucson market," [...] citing Raycom's addition of a locally produced morning newscast to KMSB, and the upgrade of KMSB's news programming to high definition {{as part of the}} transition. Although ruling out the need to do so in other markets, Diaz noted that the agreements [...] " [...] us to <b>increase</b> <b>our</b> news product that we couldn't afford to do otherwise." [...] The consolidation resulted in layoffs for almost all of the two stations' employees, aside from advertising sales staff, which remained employed by Belo but worked from KOLD's facilities. The acquisition of Belo by Gannett in 2013 had few effects on the virtual triopoly; although the stations' licenses were sold to third-parties to satisfy newspaper cross-ownership restrictions, Raycom still operates the stations, but their sales departments remained operated by Gannett. The licenses were, in turn, sold to Tegna—the spin-out of Gannett's broadcasting division, in December 2015.|$|E
500|$|Dyke {{believed}} it was significant that [...] "six of the largest clubs" [...] voted against BSkyB. He wrote a formal letter to Quinton which asked for the bidding process to be reopened as the network was barred from bettering BSkyB's bid. Quinton however rejected the plea and clarified the league's stance: BSkyB's bid was better [...] "...not only in money terms {{but as far as}} the potential for future income is concerned." [...] The ITV companies sought legal action, claiming a breach of obligation on behalf of Quinton and Parry. East revealed that it was only after BSkyB had won did they discover the company had submitted an improved bid: [...] "At no stage were we informed that Sky had put in another bid and nor were we given any opportunity to <b>increase</b> <b>our</b> bid in response." [...] Parry said ITV would have won broadcasting rights had they [...] "allowed us to have a pay channel in the long term and it had terrestrial coverage in the short-term." [...] The High Court refused to grant an injunction; the judge concluded the matter was [...] "a great deal more difficult than it seems at first sight" [...] and it would be wrong to force the league to consider new offers. The court however found an arguable case for a breach of confidence. Soon afterwards, ITV issued a writ seeking damages against the FA and Premier League. They also submitted a separate complaint to the Office of Fair Trading to look into Murdoch's newspapers.|$|E

[...] Ehrlich described a number of [...] "ideas on how these goals might be reached." [...] He believed that the United States should take {{a leading role in}} population control, both because it was already consuming much more {{than the rest of the}} world, and therefore had a moral duty to reduce its impact, and because the US would have to lead international efforts due to its prominence in the world. In order to avoid charges of hypocrisy or racism it would have to take the lead in population reduction efforts. Ehrlich floats the idea of adding [...] "temporary sterilants" [...] to the water supply or staple foods. However, he rejects the idea as unpractical due to [...] "criminal inadequacy of biomedical research in this area." [...] He suggests a tax scheme in which additional children would add to a family's tax burden at increasing rates for more children, as well as luxury taxes on childcare goods. He suggests incentives for men who agree to permanent sterilization before they have two children, as well as a variety of other monetary incentives. He proposes a powerful Department of Population and Environment which [...] "should be set up with the power to take whatever steps are necessary to establish a reasonable population size in the United States and to put an end to the steady deterioration of our environment." [...] The department should support research into population control, such as better contraceptives, mass sterilizing agents, and prenatal sex discernment (because families often continue to have children until a male is born. Ehrlich suggested that if they could choose a male child this would reduce the birthrate). Legislation should be enacted guaranteeing the right to an abortion, and sex education should be expanded.|$|E
