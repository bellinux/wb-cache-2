40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of automatic metering system {{is presented in}} this paper. The power management system is consists of Zigbee Digital Power meters installed in every consumer unit and an Electricity <b>e-Billing</b> system at the energy provider side. The Zigbee Digital Power meter (ZPM) is a single phase digital kWh power meter with embedded Zigbee modem which utilize the Wireless sensor network to send its power usage reading using information back to the energy provider wirelessly. At the power provider side an <b>e-billing</b> system is used to manage a received zigbee meter reading, compute the billing cost, update the database, and to publish billing notification to its respective consumer through wireless. Traditional meter reading for electricity consumption and billing is done by human operator from houses to houses and building to building. This requires huge number of labour operators and long working hour to achieve complete area data reading and billing. Human operator billing are prone to reading error as sometime the houses electric power meter is place in a location where it is not easily accessible. The proposed system makes use of current and voltage sensors to measure the current and voltage and thereby determine the power consumed. The analog data is converted to a digital format and is transmitted to the supplier end through wireless networks. Hence in the new system there is the provision for the service provider to monitor the voltage, current and energy consumed by the user. The real time billing of the energy consumed is calculated at the supplier end and is transmitted to the consumer end and is displayed in an LCD. Also the service provider can control the energy consumption of the consumers by selecting different modes of operation...|$|R

Finland is one of the European countries who are far ahead in the field of electronic invoices and more and more Finnish companies are moving over to it. However, often it is the larger companies that have the expertise and resources to implement such invoicing systems while smaller companies are more cautious with the adoption of new systems or standards. So how much does it take for a small company to develop and implement their own Finvoice B 2 C billing solution? Most well known billing software providers in Finland are already providing Finvoice invoice support with their software. Some banks are even offering online portals for companies to send electronic bills. However, all these products and services come with a price. This thesis will look further into the Finvoice billing standard and the effort needed to develop a Finvoice invoicing solution for a small company. This will be carried out with the goal of gaining knowledge in the field of electronic invoicing and investigating the requirements to develop a cost efficient billing solution for a small size company.

Another aim was to develop an adoption forecast for the service. Finally, customer categorization was suggested in order to enable e-return deliver more public value by accommodating the needs of different customer groups. Diffusion of Innovations theory, Bass Diffusion Model and Service Process Analysis were used as theoretical base for the study. E-return user satisfaction survey conducted by Finnish Tax Administration was used for statistical analysis and mathematical modeling. In addition, e-return in Finland was benchmarked against leading practices from Denmark, Estonia and the Netherlands. Another comparative study was conducted with a popular business-to-customer service with similar characteristics – <b>e-billing</b> in TeliaSonera. As a result of the study, we discovered that the diffusion of e-return is dependent on such variables as perceived attributes of e-return system, interpersonal communication channels, performance of related services, and extent of Tax Administration’s promotion efforts. In addition, we classified taxpayers in four main categories based on taxpayers’ demographics and personal income tax filing needs. The first category, which accounts for 60 % of all population, represents those who accept tax assessment decision without making any deductions. The second category, which covers another 36 % of taxpayers, consists of individuals who make few deductions. Another 2. 5 % of taxpayers make speculative deductions that involve consultations with friends or professionals, e. g. healthcare-related deductions. The last 1. 5 % is the wealthiest taxpayers who use financial advisors for asset management and taxation. Based on our analysis, we prepared recommendations for improving the e-return service in Finland. The recommendations can be split into two groups: recommendations aiming at increasing the attractiveness of e-return for potential adopters (e. g. introduction of instant tax assessment feature online), and recommendations meant to discourage people from submitting tax return in paper (e. g. paper form service processing fee) ...|$|R

Also {{available by}} subscription via World Wide Webxv, 180 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmInformation technology (IT) has become pervasive {{in the healthcare}} industry. Many view the Internet as a strategic healthcare tool. The Medical Records Institute suggests that Internet-based health applications (IHA), for example, electronic health records, e-prescribing, and mobile health are the goals of most healthcare organizations (2002). The use of the Internet for electronic medical records, <b>e-billing</b> and patient scheduling can enable {{the health care industry}} to reduce its inefficiencies and errors in care delivery (HlMSS/IBM Leadership Survey, 2000). While the use of IT in healthcare has increased tremendously, key players, specifically physicians still have not fully embraced the valuable resource of the Internet. Despite the purported advantages of lT investments in healthcare many doctors do not widely use Internet-based health applications in their clinical practices. Physicians often misunderstand the functions and full potential of the Internet (Wang & Song, 1997). Health & Health Care 20 I 0 report that less than 5 % of physicians use computers to record all clinical information for an average patient. The present study examined physicians' intentions to adopt Internet-based health applications for use in their clinical practices. This research reports on the test-retest reliability of the extended Technology Acceptance Model-TAM 2 (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000). Data were collected from a survey of pediatricians to evaluate the effectiveness and appropriateness of the model in the medical environment. Results from the study indicate that TAM 2 is appropriate but not completely applicable to the unique characteristic of physicians. The test-retest indicated reliable results {{with the exception of the}} result demonstrability construct. The results of multiple regression analyses indicated that perceived ease of use was not significant in predicting physicians' behavioral intentions in this study. As theorized the primary predictor variable perceived usefulness was a strong determinant of intention to use. Results indicate that physicians tend to be pragmatic in their IT acceptance decisions. Physicians focus more on the technology's usefulness rather than its ease of use. This dissertation discusses the implications, limitations and presents possible explanations for the inconsistencies within the extended technology acceptance model when it is applied to a professional group not commonly examined in IS research...|$|R
