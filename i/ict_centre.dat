There are concerns, however, about unequal access to ICTs and the dangers of digital exclusion.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the potential of}} community based information and communication technology (<b>ICT)</b> <b>centres</b> to support and promote the democratic voice. It does so through presenting comparative research findings from eight <b>ICT</b> <b>centres</b> in South Asia. The research uses a methodology that combines ethnographic approaches with action research. Here I look {{at the notion of}} &# 039;democratic voice&# 039; in a loosely defined sense, referring to the ability of &# 039;ordinary&# 039; people to access media and other information and communication technologies, and to create their own local content. As such it describes to some extent the processes of &# 039;metamorphosis&# 039; involved in &# 039;citizen&# 039;s media&# 039; participants becoming, through these activities, &# 039;active citizens&# 039; (Rodriguez 2004). At a point in time when alternative media studies are recognising a new relevance and development communication research facing a crisis in direction, this paper considers research findings emerging from and utilised in community based ICT initiatives across South Asia. Looking at the research in a comparative framework, lessons can be learned about the relevance of community media for supporting democratic voice, and the processes that are most likely to achieve this...|$|R

By combined qualitative and quantitative methods, the study shows that, due to the presence of ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies) in educational centres, the frequency of computer use in the classroom has increased, along with an expansion of a teacher training process that is progressively oriented towards contextualized models of learning. After investigating the most important factors behind the success of the mass computer installation programmes at the centres, a series of recommendations at centre and governmental level are presented that will ensure the maximizing of the potential of these technological resources...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was to develop a sustainable Information and Communication Technology (ICT) model in a Nigerian community, by evaluating ICT provision in South Africa’s disadvantaged communities and comparing it with the Nigerian situation; to identify applicable models and service mechanisms; and, to identify pitfalls and risks. This research was conducted by analyzing the problem from four points of view: ICT infrastructure, management, influencing factors and the risks of ICT provision in disadvantaged communities. A literature review was undertaken to discuss those issues. Four <b>ICT</b> <b>centres</b> were involved in the case study. This study aims to evolve a commercially sustainable provision of ICT in the rural communities of Nigeria. The authors argue that bridging the digital divide in disadvantaged communities requires adequate knowledge of the underlying causes of the divide, a favourable Government policy, a focus on the benefits of providing ICT, the provision of suitable infrastructure, and a committed management that is prepared to get round the various barriers or risks found in disadvantaged communities...|$|R

40|$|Socio-economic {{development}} and rural transformation {{is a priority}} for the Government of Uganda (GoU) as stipulated in the National Development Plan (NDP) - 2010 / 11 - 2014 / 15. Limited access and use of energy significantly slows down economic and social transformation. To this effect, energy is identified as a priority complimentary sector {{to all the other}} social sectors that will be vital for the realization of the transformed Ugandan society in the medium and the long term. One of the priorities for the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD) in the medium term is to increase access to modern energy services through rural electrification and renewable energy development. Among the key interventions for achieving this priority, is the Energy for Rural Transformation (ERT) programme. This programme is supporting the development of mini- hydro power plants and the provision of solar Photovoltaic panels among others. The overall goal of ERT with respect to health service provision is to improve delivery of health services in rural health centres through increased access to modern energy services and Information and Communications Technology (<b>ICT).</b> The Health <b>centres</b> are provided with solar photovoltaic systems or connected to the electricity grid and <b>ICT</b> <b>centres</b> are established. This briefing paper assesses the effectiveness of the ERT interventions in the health sector and in particular health centres (HCII-HCIV). It highlights successes, challenges and policy recommendations that will enhance effective implementation of the project.
