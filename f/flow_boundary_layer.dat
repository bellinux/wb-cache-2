40|$|The {{acoustics}} of a mean <b>flow</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> over an impedance {{surface or}} acoustic lining is considered. By considering a thick mean <b>flow</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> (possibly due to turbulence), the boundary-layer structure is separated asymptotically into two decks, {{with a thin}} weakly viscous mean <b>flow</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> and an even thinner strongly viscous acoustic sublayer, without requiring a high frequency. Using this, analytic solutions are found for the acoustic modes in a cylindrical lined duct. The mode shapes in each region compare well with numerical solutions of the linearized compressible Navier–Stokes equations, as does a uniform composite asymptotic solution. A closed-form effective impedance boundary condition is derived, which {{can be applied to}} acoustics in inviscid slipping flow to account for both shear and viscosity in the boundary layer. The importance of the boundary layer is demonstrated in the frequency domain, and the new boundary condition is found to correctly predict the attenuation of upstream-propagating cut-on modes, which are poorly predicted by existing inviscid boundary conditions. Stability is also investigated, and the new boundary condition is found to yield good results away from the critical layer.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} by Ludwig Prandtl in 1904 the boundary layer theory {{is an important}} part of aerodynamics and its research continues until the present day. In general the changes occuring within the range of flow boundary layers have a wide influence and affect the flow field far beyond. This property holds equally true for the transitional process as the shift of flow from a well ordered laminar state into full turbulence not only affects the boundary layer region itself but takes influence on the entire flow field. The transitional process is initiated by instabilities in the velocity and the pressure flow field. The occuring boundary layer instabilities then can be grouped by their way of directional propagation. Tollmien-Schlichting instabilities develop into the main flow direction while for cross <b>flow</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> instabilities, propagation takes place rectangularly with respect to the main flow. The significant role of the boundary layer makes an impact on technical applications. For engineers the most important occurence of cross flow boundary instabilities can be found in the flow around aircraft wings. One characteristic aircraft design property for flight at transsonical flow is the utilisation of swept wings. For this appilication it is precisely the cross <b>flow</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> instabilities which are responsibile for the initiation of transition. Typically the transition begins near the leading egde of the wing. As transition is directly related to the flow resistance the hope for future applications is to take influence on the instability development process in a way that a delay or even avoidance of flow transition could take place. If this can be achieved a significant reduction of the flow resistance could be attained and hence improve the fuel efficiency of modern aircraft. However, influence mechanisms regarding cross <b>flow</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> instabilities are not well understood...|$|E

40|$|For {{the three}} {{dimensional}} hypersonic viscous compressible flat plate flow, {{when there is}} only small roughness on the wall, its effect {{can be considered as}} perturbation to two dimensional roughness-free plate flow. To study such a flow problem, we will assume there is only a single roughness element on the plate, of which the equation is in the self-similar form η = eY 0 (E), where E =zx -¾ and e << 1, and thus the perturbed <b>flow</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> equations will also have self-similar solutions. When solving the boundary layer equations, we use the Dorodnitsyn Transformation and write the solutions in coordinate asymptotic expansions. In these expansions, the leading order terms are the solutions to the two dimensional flat plate <b>flow</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> equations, and the expression of these terms will be treated as already known since they can be obtained from the Blasius Equation.
