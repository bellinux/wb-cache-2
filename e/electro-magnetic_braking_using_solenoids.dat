Rather than a conventional contact friction braking, this system are more efficient, quick in the response and has no wear so it has good durability. So three different papers are reviewed and summarized here to know the principles, applicability and future scope of <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> system. Key words: <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>braking,</b> Permanent magnet; Magnetic braking, FEM of electromagnetic braking...|$|R
50|$|Besides {{pneumatic}} {{brakes and}} a hydraulic braking system, class 612 is also {{equipped with an}} <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>brake.</b> The maximum tilt is 8°.|$|R
50|$|Most drum motors can {{be fitted}} with back stop {{non-reversing}} bearings to prevent belts in inclined conveyors from rolling back or with <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>brakes</b> for reversible inclined conveyors or for quick stopping. Incremental encoders {{can also be}} integrated into the rotor bearings to provide a closed loop control system for tracking, positioning and accurate tracing of the product on the belt.|$|R
5000|$|The cars take {{electricity}} from a 550 Volts DC overhead line. Each car is 13.37 m long, 2.5 m wide and 3.45 m high, with 50 seats {{and a total}} carrying capacity of 120 passengers. They have four [...] motors, giving a maximum speed of 35 km/h, and are equipped for rheostatic braking, in addition to air <b>brakes,</b> <b>electro-magnetic</b> track <b>brakes</b> and hand brakes.|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} rail vehicles, {{such as the}} "Adler", a {{mechanical}} screw brake on the tender was enough in 1835 to slow the train down safely from its permitted speed of 28 km/h. More than 100 years later, in addition to mechanical pneumatic <b>braking</b> systems, <b>electro-magnetic</b> rail <b>brakes</b> were already being used {{in order to bring}} the streamlined motor coach, the DRG 137 of the Cologne design, from a speed of 160 km/h to a stop over a distance of 800 metres. Today also eddycurrent <b>brakes</b> are <b>used</b> on modern train sets...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Solenoid</b> valves are <b>used</b> in {{fluid power}} {{pneumatic}} and hydraulic systems, to control cylinders, fluid power motors or larger industrial valves. Automatic irrigation sprinkler systems also <b>use</b> <b>solenoid</b> valves {{with an automatic}} controller. Domestic washing machines and dishwashers <b>use</b> <b>solenoid</b> valves to control water entry into the machine. They are also often used in paintball gun triggers to actuate the CO2 hammer valve. Solenoid valves are usually referred to simply as [...] "solenoids." ...|$|R
2500|$|Camless valvetrains <b>using</b> <b>solenoids</b> or {{magnetic}} {{systems have}} long been investigated by BMW and Fiat, and are currently being prototyped by Valeo and Ricardo ...|$|R
50|$|The 3000 class bogies {{are built}} by Comeng and feature airbag {{secondary}} suspension. All 3000 class railcars are fitted with <b>electro-magnetic</b> track <b>brakes,</b> which are comparatively rare on trains, {{though they are}} commonly found on trams. These are operated separately from the normal mechanical and dynamic braking.|$|R
50|$|Both {{electromagnetic}} {{brakes and}} eddy current <b>brakes</b> <b>use</b> electromagnetic force but electromagnetic brakes ultimately depend on friction and eddy current <b>brakes</b> <b>use</b> magnetic force directly.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{studies on}} {{neutrino}} factories <b>use</b> <b>solenoids</b> at di#erent stages. Often quoted is the adiabatic device, a long solenoid with a slowly decreasing field used to capture pions behind the target. In cooling sections as well, design reports show lattices <b>using</b> <b>solenoids</b> with alternating field {{to contain the}} beam. This note describes the transverse behaviour of charged particles in a solenoidal field. First, a general description of the magnetic field is reviewed with emphasis on particular features, such as the canonicalmomentum formalism. Then, a complete study of the adiabatic device is presented, along with tracking simulations based on hamiltonian mechanics...|$|R

40|$|K e y w o r d s: diesel fuel, {{pure plant oil}} fuel, tractor engine power, fuel consumption. A b s t r a c t The paper {{summarizes}} {{results of}} tests of John Deere agricultural tractor type 6830 fueled with pure raps oil. The measurements were performed <b>using</b> an <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>brake</b> connected to the tractor with a power transfer shaft (WOM). Specification of the engine fueled with pure raps oil was drawn up during the tests and it was compared with the engine fueled with diesel. The main conclusions include identification of a power drop of the engine fueled with the raps oil {{by an average of}} 10 % in comparison with the same engine fueled with diesel and increase of fuel consumption per kWh by 15 %. The identified drop of power had no impact of work efficiency including power consuming agricultural works...|$|R

5000|$|Air <b>brakes</b> are <b>used</b> as an {{alternative}} to hydraulic <b>brakes</b> which are <b>used</b> on lighter vehicles such as automobiles. Hydraulic <b>brakes</b> <b>use</b> a liquid (hydraulic fluid) to transfer pressure from the brake pedal to the brake shoe to stop the vehicle. Air brakes have several advantages for large multitrailer vehicles: ...|$|R

50|$|In current (2009) applications, most EC <b>brakes</b> <b>use</b> {{cast iron}} discs similar to vehicle disc <b>brake</b> rotors, and <b>use</b> {{variable}} electromagnets {{to change the}} magnetic field strength to control the amount of braking.|$|R
50|$|Releasing {{panels are}} capable of <b>using</b> <b>solenoids</b> to {{disperse}} fire-fighting chemical agents such as halon or water from piping located throughout a building. A releasing panel usually will have a manual abort switch to abort an accidental release which could damage property or equipment. Releasing capability {{can be part of}} both addressable or conventional panels.|$|R

25|$|In normal {{operation}} for locomotive/carriage trains, on descending and level running, {{the train is}} normally <b>braked</b> (service <b>braking)</b> <b>using</b> the locomotive. This <b>uses</b> compression <b>braking</b> – the energy is absorbed by using the cylinders as pumps, then dumping the pressure, similar to a Jake brake – on steam locomotives, hydraulic braking on the diesel locomotives. The diesel-electric railcars were service <b>braked</b> <b>using</b> hydraulic <b>brakes</b> and dynamic braking, during which power was dissipated in roof-mounted resistors, creating a distinct heat shimmer when the vehicles were descending and shortly afterwards. The hand <b>brakes</b> are <b>used</b> to bring a train to a complete stand from low speed, and as a parking brake.|$|R
25|$|Unlike the KR175, the KR200 had a {{full set}} of pedals: clutch, brake, and accelerator. The brake pedal still {{operated}} mechanical <b>brakes</b> <b>using</b> cables.|$|R

50|$|The chain brake, {{an early}} British railway brake, {{was similar to}} the Heberlein <b>brake</b> but <b>used</b> a chain, instead of a cable. An example was the Clark and Webb Chain <b>Brake,</b> <b>used</b> by the London and North Western Railway. Early {{versions}} were non-automatic and would not stop the train if a coupling broke.|$|R

50|$|Modern {{electronic}} {{automatic transmissions}} have electrical solenoids which are activated to change gears. Simple electronic-control designs (such as Ford's AOD-E, AXOD-E and E4OD) <b>use</b> the <b>solenoids</b> {{to modify the}} shift points in an existing valve body, while more advanced designs (such as the Chrysler Ultradrive and its follow-ons) <b>use</b> the <b>solenoids</b> to control the clutches indirectly, {{by way of a}} greatly simplified valve body.|$|R
