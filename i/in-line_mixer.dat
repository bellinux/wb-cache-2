50|$|To {{extract the}} alginate, the seaweed is broken into pieces and stirred {{with a hot}} {{solution}} of an alkali, usually sodium carbonate. Over {{a period of about}} two hours, the alginate dissolves as sodium alginate to give a very thick slurry. This slurry also contains the part of the seaweed that does not dissolve, mainly cellulose. This insoluble residue must be removed from the solution. The solution is too thick (viscous) to be filtered and must be diluted with a very large quantity of water. After dilution, the solution is forced through a filter cloth in a filter press. However, the pieces of undissolved residue are very fine and can quickly clog the filter cloth. Therefore, before filtration is started, a filter aid, such as diatomaceous earth, must be added; this holds most of the fine particles away {{from the surface of the}} filter cloth and facilitates filtration. However, filter aid is expensive and can make a significant contribution to costs. To reduce the quantity of filter aid needed, some processors force air into the extract as it is being diluted with water (the extract and diluting water are mixed in an <b>in-line</b> <b>mixer</b> into which air is forced). Fine air bubbles attach themselves to the particles of residue. The diluted extract is left standing for several hours while the air rises to the top, taking the residue particles with it. This frothy mix of air and residue is removed from the top and the solution is withdrawn from the bottom and pumped to the filter.|$|E

The effect of process conditions, three mixer scales and thirteen rotor-stator geometry configurations on emulsification performance were investigated. Emulsions {{of a wide range of}} silicone oil viscosities of varying phase volumes, dispersed in aqueous surfactant and non-surfactant solutions were studied. For lab to factory scale <b>in-line</b> rotor-stator <b>mixers,</b> the most appropriate scaling parameter for mean drop size was tip speed at constant residence time for single and multiple passes. At a single scale, the stator open area was the rotor-stator geometry parameter which had the greatest effect on power draw and emulsification in turbulent flow. Mean drop size was a strong function of the rotor speed, dispersed phase viscosity, interfacial tension, and less dependent upon the mixer flow rate, continuous phase viscosity and dispersed phase volume fraction (for surfactant systems). Correlation of mean drop size with energy dissipation rate indicated that droplet break-up mainly depends on turbulent inertial stresses. Energy dissipation rate profiles were calculated theoretically using numerical simulations to calculate power draw and to solve population balance model equations. This is the first study in open literature where power consumption and drop size distributions in three scales of <b>in-line</b> rotor-stator <b>mixer</b> are reported. ...|$|R

Through the years, numerous methods have been developed to treat MTBE, and many of these advanced treatment processes are complicated and costly. The present research investigates the development of a simple and cost-effective process for the degradation of MTBE.; Chain reactions involving ultrasound and Fenton's reagent are the epitome of this system. Fenton's reagent can be continuously supplied by sonolysis of water and naturally occurring metal salts in groundwater. The laboratory test results have shown complete MTBE degradation under the ultrasound-assisted chemical process (UACP) within one hour. For subsurface operations in the field, ultrasonic transducers attached on the double-wall pipe and horizontal directional drilling technology can greatly increase the effective area of in-situ remediation.; A whistle type <b>in-line</b> <b>mixer</b> installed in a re-circulating flow loop without external electric power was used to create hydrodynamic cavitation and induce oxidation in UACP.

Once there is a MTBE plume approaching, the only choice for them is to shut down the production wells unless they have enough funding.

40|$|Surfactant {{adsorption}} to the liquid–solid interface is {{of great}} importance to many industrial and consumer processes; from detergency to crop spraying and drilling for oil, the understanding of how these molecules behave is crucial to their design and further efficiency improvement. This thesis describes how a Raman spectrometer for use in total-internal reflection (TIR) -Raman spectroscopy was built and commissioned to provide a new, open bench system. The prime aim was to improve on the time resolution of our existing commercial spectrometer (to < 1 s) and allow for easy modification. TIR-Raman spectroscopy allows us to be surface-selective by only measuring the Raman spectrum from {{very close to the}} interface, where the evanescent field excites molecules attached to, or very close to the surface. As this field decays exponentially with distance, only a small region at the interface is probed (≈ 100 nm). Using an <b>in-line</b> <b>mixer</b> we were able to record adsorption and desorption isotherms on the surfaces. This technique utilised a continuously stirred tank to vary continually the concentration of solution entering the cell, hence a whole continuous range of concentrations (limited only by the time resolution) could be studied.

Numerical simulations were also conducted to study fluid mixing in a novel two-dimensional <b>in-line</b> <b>mixer</b> utilizing multiple impinging stream inlets.

40|$|Static mixers, {{also known}} as {{motionless}} or <b>in-line</b> <b>mixers,</b> constitutea low-cost option for mixing in the chemical process industry. Static mixers offer attractive features such as closed-loop operation and no moving parts, in contrast to continuously-stirred tank reactors (for example, Streiff and Rogers, 1994). The static mixer {{is a collection of}} blades which fits inside a pipe carrying the fluids to be blended. The two liquids to be mixed (typically a polymer melt and an additive) are forced through the mixer under high pressure, and they are cut and folded repeatedly as they negotiate the bends and openings within the mixer. The scale of segregation between the liquids is greatly reduced by this process such that eventually diffusion can complete the mixing process. The reduction in the scale of segregation is dependent on the liquid properties and the number and type of mixing elements. Our goal at present has been to investigate the effectiveness of static mixing in an SMX mixer between two miscible liquid streams as a function of viscosity ratio (m) and Reynolds number (Re) in the laminar flow regime. The current study concerns the mixing of viscous fluids in the SMX geometry motionless mixer (Figure 1). The SMX is a common industrial mixer with many advantages.

No differences were observed in the droplet sizes or power draw of the stators with the smallest and similar open areas (Emulsor Screens and Square Hole High Shear screen). The power supplied to the fluid was proportional to N 3 indicating the mixer was operating under turbulent conditions. d 32 was correlated against the rotor speed and dispersed phase and the relationship was found to be close to that described by Chen and Middleman (1967).

40|$|Numerous {{advanced}} {{coal cleaning}} processes {{have been developed}} {{in recent years that}} are capable of substantially reducing both ash- and sulfur-forming minerals from coal. However, most of the processes involve fine grinding and use water as the cleaning medium; therefore, the clean coal products must be dewatered before they can be transported and burned. Unfortunately, dewatering fine coal is costly, which makes it difficult to deploy advanced coal cleaning processes for commercial applications. As a means of avoiding problems associated with the fine coal dewatering, the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) developed a dry coal cleaning process in which mineral matter is separated from coal without using water. In this process, pulverized coal is subjected to triboelectrification before being placed in an electric field for electrostatic separation. The triboelectrification is accomplished by passing a pulverized coal through an <b>in-line</b> <b>mixer</b> made of copper. Copper has a work function that lies between that of carbonaceous material (coal) and mineral matter. Thus, coal particles impinging on the copper wall lose electrons to the metal thereby acquiring positive charges, while mineral matter impinging on the wall gain electrons to acquire negative charges. The charged particles then pass through an electric field where they are separated according to their charges into two or more products depending on the configuration of the separator. The results obtained at NETL showed that it is capable of removing more than 90 % of the pyritic sulfur and 70 % of the ash-forming minerals from a number of eastern U. S. coals. However, the BTU recoveries were less than desirable. The laboratory-scale batch triboelectrostatic separator (TES) used by NETL relied on adhering charged particles on parallel electrode surfaces and scraping them off. Therefore, its throughput will be proportional to the electrode surface area. If this laboratory device is scaled-up as is, it would suffer from low throughput capacities and high maintenance requirements. In general, surface area-based separators (e. g., shaking tables, magnetic drum separator, electrodynamic separator, etc.) have lower throughput capacities than volume-based separators (e. g., flotation cell, dense-medium bath, cyclones, etc.) by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, the electrodes of the laboratory unit need to be cleaned frequently, creating a high maintenance requirement if it is scaled-up to a commercial unit. The bench-scale continuous TES unit developed at NETL, on the other hand, separates positively and negatively charged particles by splitting the gaseous stream containing these particles in an electric field by means of a flow splitter, so that the oppositely charged particles can be directed into different compartments. This device is fundamentally different from the laboratory unit in that the former is a surface area-based separator, while the latter is a volume-based separator. The bench-scale unit is referred to as an entrained flow separator by the in-house researchers at NETL. Thus, the entrained flow TES unit is a significant improvement over the laboratory unit with regard to throughput capacity. In the present work, the entrained flow separator concept will be utilized for developing a proof-of concept (POC) separator that can be scaled-up to commercial size units. To accomplish this, it is necessary to develop a bench-scale separator that can achieve high Btu recoveries while maintaining the high degree of separation efficiencies. It is the objective of the present investigation to develop an efficient separator by studying the mechanisms of triboelectrification and investigating better ways of separating the charged particles. An important criterion for developing efficient separators is that they not only provide high separation efficiencies but also have high throughput capacities, which are essential ingredients for successful commercialization...|$|E

The microwave- based, continuous MSDS efficiently couples microwaves to a single-phase, pressurized, flowing water stream that is rapidly heated above 150 C. Under these conditions, water is rapidly sterilized. Endotoxins, significant biological toxins that originate from the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria and which represent another defining MGW requirement, are also deactivated (i. e., depyrogenated) albeit more slowly, with such deactivation representing a more difficult challenge than sterilization. Several innovations culminated in the successful MSDS prototype design. The most significant is the antenna-directed microwave heating of a water stream flowing through a microwave sterilization chamber (MSC). Novel antenna designs were developed to increase microwave transmission efficiency. These improvements resulted in greater than 95 -percent absorption of incident microwaves. In addition, incorporation of recuperative heat exchangers (RHxs) in the design reduced the microwave power required to heat a water stream flowing at 15 mL/min to 170 C to only 50 W. Further improvements in energy efficiency involved the employment of a second antenna to redirect reflected microwaves back into the MSC, eliminating the need for a water load and simplifying MSDS design. A quick connect (QC) is another innovation that can be sterilized and depyrogenated at temperature, and then cooled using a unique flow design, allowing collection of MGW at atmospheric pressure and 80 C.

One of the uses for rotor-stator mixer is to perform liquid-liquid homogenization. The small gap between the rotor tip and surrounding stator in combination of high rotational speeds yields high magnitudes of what is considered as break-up forces. The flow inside the mixer is highly turbulent and extremely complex. There exist today {{a limited number of}} papers explaining the flow and turbulence fields inside the mixer.

A workflow consisting of verified methodology custom for rotor-stator <b>mixer</b> of type <b>in-line,</b> reviewing the steps from a CAD-model to steady-state of a CFD-simulation would effectively decrease the time needed compared to if one start from naught every time. Additionally it would be beneficial if the approximations made in a CFD-simulation of a periodic slice of a mixer compared to a full scale model are rendered acceptable. This is especially advantageous when the simulation uses LES to resolve the turbulence as a slice would keep down the computational costs. The thesis is divided into two parts. First part is RANS-simulation of an <b>in-line</b> <b>mixers</b> pump curve and flow field. Second part is a feasibility study of the possibility to perform a LES-simulation of a periodic slice instead of a full scale batch mixer. From the RANS simulations two workflows have been developed.

Experimental measurements and grid convergence studies have has served as verification of the simulation results. One workflow is aimed to obtain the mixers pump curve. The other workflow is developed in purpose to model the local flow variables i. e. resolve the flow field inside the mixer.

The primary progress of the study is that simulation of a periodic slice that consists of a stationary and moving region is viable.

For both estimation methods, no knowledge of the kinetic model for polymerisation is needed. Experimental results indicate that with an accurate model of the process energy balance, in which, for example, the recycle pump energy input is described, the Kalman filter approach is found to provide excellent prediction of conversion, for both high and low conversions, for this pilot-plant reactor system. The approach does not require any (approximate) kinetic knowledge, and is thus considerably easier in implementation than the extended Kalman filter approaches. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In the first study, water was dispersed into viscous oil using a batch Silverson L 4 R rotor-stator mixer. The flow regime was determined by reference to published Power number data and by qualitative differences in drop size data. Drop breakup in laminar flow was analyzed by comparison to published single drop breakup experiments in idealized flow fields. The breakup mechanism in laminar flow {{was similar to that}} for simple shear flow and equal to about twice the nominal shear rate in the rotor-stator gap. Drop breakup in turbulent flow followed a mechanistic correlation for mean drop size for drops less than the Kolmogorov microscale, but still large enough that both inertial and viscous effects were manifest. Surfactants decreased drop size with Marangoni effects observed near the CMC for laminar, but not for turbulent flow. Below phase fractions of = 0. 05, d 32 increased in a log-linear fashion with phase fraction for all conditions tested including: laminar and turbulent flow, presence of surfactant, and hydrophobically treated high-shear surfaces.

40|$|Includes bibliography. This thesis {{attempts}} to resolve {{some of the}} major problems associated with lime treatment in waste water reclamation. The contribution to knowledge is briefly outlined below. One of the major problems associated with lime treatment is the instability of lime-treated effluent, which may result in serious calcium carbonate scale formation problems. In the thesis this instability is attributed to two fundamental causes, (1) Incomplete precipitation, i. e. a kinetic problem. (2) The unintentional absorption of carbon dioxide from the air by the highly alkaline lime-treated effluent, i. e. a contamination problem. Calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide precipitation are time dependent. As a consequence of this time dependency unstable effluent may be produced under reaction conditions commonly encountered in practice. An exhaustive study identified the major factors affecting the precipitation kinetics. Reaction system conditions required for producing a stable effluent are, (1) Lime slurry and sludge, in that sequence, must be thoroughly mixed with the waste water, preferably by means of <b>in-line</b> static <b>mixers,</b> before discharge to a completely stirred tank reactor. (2) A completely stirred tank reactor with a minimum mean residence time of two minutes must be provided for the dissolution and precipitation reactions to go as near to completion as possible. (3) The reactor contents must have a sludge concentration of the order of 10 000 mg l⁻¹...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Small {{particles}} {{typical of}} liquid swine manure often clog sand filter beds and fine filters. We evaluated the effec-tiveness of polymer flocculants to improve drainage and filtration performance of sand filter beds {{by increasing the}} particle size of manure. A pilot separation unit was evaluated at the Swine Unit of the NCSU Lake Wheeler Road Laboratory in Ra-leigh, North Carolina, in 40 consecutive cycles during a 20 -month period. The unit consisted of a homogenization tank that mixed the flushed swine manure, an <b>in-line</b> polymer <b>mixer,</b> and two sand filter beds (29. 7 m 2) designed to receive 30. 5 cm (1 ft) depth of the polymer-treated effluent. Flocculation treatment using polyacrylamide (PAM) polymer improved drainage characteristics of the sand filter by preventing clogging and surface sealing. The combination of flocculation and filtration treatment removed 97 % of total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS), 85 % of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), and 83 % of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from the flushed manure. Along with the solids, treatment resulted in capture of 61 % total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and 72 % total phosphorus (TP). Most of the nutrients removed in the solids were organic forms. Drying time to produce removable cakes varied significantly with the loading rate of solids applied to the sand filter bed. A load of < 2 kg TSS m− 2 per drying cycle allowed completion of the drying cycle in about 8 days, which is desirable to reduce potential fly problems. Our results indicate that PAM flocculation enhances performance of dewatering sand filter beds for swine manure applications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} scale, {{processing}} conditions, interfacial tension and viscosity of the dispersed phase on power draw and drop size distributions in three <b>in-line</b> Silverson rotor–stator <b>mixers</b> was investigated {{with the aim}} to determine the most appropriate scaling up parameter. The largest mixer was a factory scale device, whilst the smallest was a laboratory scale mixer. All the mixers were geometrically similar and were fitted with double rotors and standard double emulsor stators. 1 wt. % silicone oils with viscosities of 9. 4 mPas and 339 mPas in aqueous solutions of surfactant or ethanol were emulsified in single and multiple pass modes. The effect of rotor speed, flow rate, dispersed phase viscosity, interfacial tension and scale on drop size distributions was investigated. It was found that for all three scales, power draw {{is the sum of}} the rotor and flow contributions, with proportionality constants, PoZ and k 1, that are practically scale independent. Sauter mean drop size appeared to correlate better with tip speed than energy dissipation rate. For ethanol/water solutions, mean drop size correlated well with Weber number based on interfacial tension, but for surfactant solutions effective interfacial tension gave better correlations with Weber number...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA major {{challenge}} for the infant formula industry is to develop more energy efficient processes while maintaining product quality and robust manufacturing practices. An effective way of improving energy utilisation {{is to reduce the}} number of processing steps during manufacture. This study examines a novel high solids process with reduced processing steps paying particular attention to emulsion stability. Model infant formulations (whey to casein ratio, 60 : 40) were homogenised at a solids content of 60 % w/w using an <b>in-line</b> colloid-mill type <b>mixer,</b> yielding a stable emulsion with a fat globule size distribution (D(v, 0. 9)) of 2. 99 colonm. These formulations were heat-treated using a high velocity direct steam injection device, whereby steam is accelerated using a De Laval nozzle before injection. The steam condenses on contact with the formulation, giving up latent heat, thus heating the mix. The process was found to increase the colloidal stability of the formulations, as measured in an analytical centrifuge. The fat globule size distribution was significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased to 2. 69 μm after processing by the injector with a concomitant significant (p < 0. 05) increase in emulsion viscosity. In conclusion, in-line homogenisation followed by high velocity steam injection, using a De Laval geometry, was successfully used for heat treatment of a high solids infant formulation...|$|R

Below phase fractions of 0. 05, d 32 increased in a log-linear fashion with phase fraction for all conditions tested including: laminar and turbulent flow, presence of surfactant, and hydrophobically treated high-shear surfaces. The significant effect of phase fraction was caused by the flow structure being locally laminar near the drops, and was permitted by sufficiently low fluid viscosities which promoted film drainage. Above phase fractions of 0. 1, drop sizes plateaued. This was attributed to decreasing coalescence rate and efficiency, along with increasing breakup. In the second study, the power consumption of an IKA 2000 / 4 in-line pilot scale rotor-stator mixer was measured with a purpose-built torque meter. The power spent by the mixer on pumping was insignificant compared to viscous dissipation. A constant power number was obtained for turbulent flow using constant power per stage with an empirically determined effective diameter for each generator type. For conditions where mean drop size was close to equilibrium, as determined by flowrate independence, previously reported mean drop size data were calculated using the well-known inertial subrange scaling law along with the power draw measurements of the present study. The maximum local energy dissipation rate was found to be nine times the average energy dissipation rat...|$|R
40|$|Rotor-stator mixers {{have a broad}} {{spectrum}} of applications in chemical, petrochemical and pharmaceutical processes since they produce the high shear fields for emulsification and dispersion processes. To assess device performance and quantify mixing and dispersion capabilities, analyzing the velocity field data due to the rotor-stator interactions is crucial. Experimental 2 -D velocity data have previously been acquired using Particle Image Velocity (PIV) for an <b>in-line</b> IKA prototype <b>mixer</b> which contains single rows of 12 rotor teeth and 14 stator teeth. The working fluid was water in turbulent flow. In this thesis, the development and validation of a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is reported along with the comparison between the CFD and PIV data. The CFD model geometry and mesh were developed within ANSYS Workbench with a fully transient sliding mesh 3 -D RANS simulations performed with Fluent using the realizable k-ϵ turbulence model. To begin, the effect of mesh density and wall treatment were systematically tested to optimize the CFD simulation settings. With respect to post processing, the numerical data were sampled in a stator slot at 9 rotor tooth positions on a grid that closely mimicked that for PIV data acquisition. The comparisons were made for three different rotor speeds (10, 20, and 26 revolutions per second) but at the same volumetric throughput (1. 3 liters per second). The study of near-wall modelling options considered Non-Equilibrium Wall Functions (NEWF) and Enhanced Wall Treatment (EWT). Both produced similar results but EWT showed advantage in computational efficiency. In the mesh independence study, 3 mesh levels were created with approximately 2, 6, and 16 million cells. The study revealed that the mesh level with 6 million cells was sufficient to insure grid independence at reasonable accuracy. The CFD and PIV data compared favorably in many aspects. On average, CFD predicted the location of mixing layer and rotor tip vortices within 6. 0 % of the stator slot width compared to the PIV data. CFD also successfully identified 23 out of 27 (85. 1 %) mixing layer and rotor tip vortices captured by PIV. Differences were observed as well. The CFD simulations consistently yielded highe...|$|R
