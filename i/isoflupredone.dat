40|$|Bovine {{respiratory}} disease (BRD) {{is the leading}} cause of illness and death in U. S. feedlot cattle. This study evaluated the use of <b>isoflupredone</b> acetate in the treatment of BRD. Crossbred male beef calves (n = 192; BW = 221 Â± 3. 9 kg) were acquired in two blocks from regional auction markets and transported to the University of Arkansas Stocker and Receiving Cattle Unit. Calves were observed daily for signs of respiratory illness. Antibiotic treatment was administered if calves displayed signs of respiratory illness and rectal temperature was â‰¥ 40 Â°C. Calves (n = 72) requiring antibiotic treatment were assigned randomly to either treatment 1 (florfenicol) or treatment 2 (florfenicol plus <b>isoflupredone</b> acetate). Both treatment groups were rechecked 48 hours post treatment to determine treatment efficacy. Blood was collected (at treatment and recheck) via jugular venipuncture to evaluate complete blood count. Weights were recorded on days 0, 14, 28, 45, and 46. No difference existed for medical cost (P = 0. 54) or temperature at recheck (P = 0. 43). Upon recheck, neutrophils were higher and lymphocytes were lower in calves that received <b>isoflupredone</b> acetate (P â‰¤ 0. 04). No difference existed in overall white blood cell count at recheck (P = 0. 67). Calves that received <b>isoflupredone</b> acetate tended to exhibit greater (P = 0. 09) average daily gain (ADG) between days 14 and 28 of the study.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to test the {{effectiveness}} of oral prednisolone and intra-muscular <b>isoflupredone</b> on lungfunction and histamine bronchoprovocation tests in horses suffering from IAD. The hypothesis is that prednisolone and <b>isoflupredone</b> are effective in reducing airway hypersensitivity and hyperreactivity. The study had a cross over design and was randomized, using 7 horses diagnosed with IAD. The horses received both drugs for 16 following days with a wash-out period in between. At baseline and after treatment a BAL was performed, total and differential cell count was determined from the fluid obtained. The upper and lower airways were scored on inflammation. Lungmechanics, consisting of a lungfunction test and histamine bronchoprovocation were done at baseline, after one week and after the treatments. Clinical scoring was done by longing the horses and scoring of nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing, respiratory effort, nostril flaring and respiratory rate. Prednisolone and <b>isoflupredone</b> both improved significantly lung function in IAD affected horses within 8 days. The horses were significantly less sensitive and reactive to histamine during the bronchoprovocation tests. So, both drugs come up to expectations, and are, just as in RAO affected horses, effective in reducing airway hypersensitivity and hyperreactivity in IAD affected horses...|$|E
40|$|Three {{studies are}} {{described}} in this report. First, the effect of intravenous administration of the steroidal drug <b>isoflupredone</b> acetate on healthy lactating dairy cows and lactating dairy cows with mastitis induced using bacterial endotoxin was investigated. When compared with untreated mastitic controls, cows with endotoxin-induced mastitis treated with 20 mg <b>isoflupredone</b> acetate after the development of clinical signs did not exhibit measurable differences in heart rate, rectal temperature, rumen motility, or changes in mammary gland surface area in the 14 hours following the administration of intramammary endotoxin, nor did they have significantly different milk production following the mastitic episode.;In the second study, somatic cell counts and flow cytometric analysis of cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells in the milk of lactating Holstein cows were performed before and 12 hours after the induction of mastitis using purified bacterial endotoxin. Twelve hours after the induction of mastitis, the mean percentage of cytokeratin-positive cells had increased from 4. 18 % +/- 1. 05 to 40. 63 % +/- 10. 23, and {{the mean number of}} cytokeratin-positive cells per milliliter of milk had increased from 7, 711 +/- 2, 575 to 2, 954, 554 +/- 877, 719. Treatment with flunixin meglumine or <b>isoflupredone</b> acetate after the development of clinical signs of mastitis did not mitigate the significant increases in somatic cell count or cytokeratin-positive cells in milk in the first 12 hours following endotoxin administration.;Finally, the effects of flunixin meglumine and <b>isoflupredone</b> acetate were compared in lactating Holstein dairy cows with mastitis induced by the intramammary administration of purified bacterial endotoxin. Drugs were administered to cows following the development of mammary swelling and a rectal temperature of 40 °C or greater. Neither drug decreased milk production loss nor mammary surface swelling when compared to untreated mastitic controls. Both drugs reduced the mean heart rate in treated groups over the 14 hours following endotoxin administration, when compared to untreated mastitic controls.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{prenatal}} adrenal stimulation and synthetic glucocorticoid supplementation on {{development of the}} gastro-intestinal tract of the piglet were investigated. Twelve pregnant sows were treated with either ACTH infusion, <b>Isoflupredone</b> injection or Saline between days 105 and 112 of gestation. Neonatal pigs were weighed, bled and sacrificed at 0 or at 6 h. Piglets sacrificed at 6 h were fed bovine colostrum. Transverse sections were prepared from the duodenum, jejunum and ileum for measurement of the villus amplification factor (VAF) and basal membrane circumference. Sows in the ACTH group showed an elevation in cortisol in response to infusion; this decreased after infusion and then rose again at parturition. Piglets from both the ACTH and Saline groups had more villus surface area per unit of body weight (BW) than those born to Isoflupredone-treated animals. The BW of the ACTH piglets was lower (P less than 0. 05) than those of piglets in the other groups. When {{the weight of the}} stomach and the Small Intestine (SI) was expressed {{as a function of the}} body weight, the stomach and SI:BW ratio was larger (p less than 0. 05) in pigs born to ACTH-treated sows. The circumference of the ileum was larger at 6 h than at 0 h. Control pigs had a higher concentration of bovine IgG at 4 and 6 h (P less than 0. 05). Observations of the light microscopic preparations indicated a less organized epithelium in both ACTH and <b>isoflupredone</b> pigs sacrificed at 0 h. Light and EM preparations of ileum from ACTH pigs sacrificed at 6 h, showed an abundance of dark-stained vacuoles, characteristic of IgG-containing structures. These became less evident in piglets from the <b>Isoflupredone</b> group and even less so in the control groups. The consequences of these phenomena in terms of absorptive capacity are discussed.

40|$|Dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM) {{is characterized}} by ventricular dilatation, {{and it is a}} common cause of heart failure and cardiac transplantation. This study aimed to explore potential DCM-related genes and their underlying regulatory mechanism using methods of bioinformatics. The gene expression profiles of GSE 3586 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database, including 15 normal samples and 13 DCM samples. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between normal and DCM samples using Limma package in R language. Pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs was then performed. Meanwhile, the potential transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) of these DEGs were predicted based on their binding sequences. In addition, DEGs were mapped to the cMap database to find the potential small molecule drugs. A total of 4777 genes were identified as DEGs by comparing gene expression profiles between DCM and control samples. DEGs were significantly enriched in 26 pathways, such as lymphocyte TarBase pathway and androgen receptor signaling pathway. Furthermore, potential TFs (SP 1, LEF 1, and NFAT) were identified, as well as potential miRNAs (miR- 9, miR- 200 family, and miR- 30 family). Additionally, small molecules like <b>isoflupredone</b> and trihexyphenidyl were found to be potential therapeutic drugs for DCM.

Current automated assays involve expensive equipment, lengthy sample preparation and handling, costly reagents and slow rates of data acquisition and analysis. We have developed a high throughput screen (HTS) for neurite outgrowth using a robust neuronal cell model coupled to fast and inexpensive visualization methods, reduced data volume and rapid data analysis. Neuroscreen- 1 (NS- 1) cell, a subclone of PC 12, possessing rapid growth and enhanced sensitivity to NGF was used as a model neuron. This method reduces preparation time by using cells expressing GFP or native cells stained with HCS CellMask™ Red in a multiplexed 30 min fixation and staining step. A 2 x 2 camera binning process reduced both image data files and analysis times by 75 % and 60 % respectively, compared to current protocols. In addition, eliminating autofocus steps during montage generation reduced data collection time.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to verify the effect of dexamethasone on the protein profile of endometrial fluid, in the presence or absence of infection, from mares susceptible to persistent postbreeding endometritis. Nine susceptible mares aged between 7 and 18  years were used. After checking for signs of estrus, mares were subjected to four treatments: C: mares received no treatment and served as control; D: mares received 40 -mg dexamethasone at breeding, with collection of samples after 6  hours; I- 6 and I- 24 : intrauterine infusion of 1  ×  109 Streptococcus zooepidemicus/mL and samples collected after 6 and 24  hours; I/D- 6 and I/D- 24 : intrauterine infusion of 1  ×  109 S zooepidemicus/mL and 40 -mg dexamethasone, collecting the sample after 6 and 24  hours. All mares were subjected to all treatments. Samples were collected and subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry for the identification of relevant protein spots. Corticotherapy altered the protein profile of the endometrial fluid of susceptible mares, characterized by an increase and/or decrease in the optical density of inflammatory acute-phase proteins. We conclude that the use of dexamethasone in mares with and without infection alters the protein profile of endometrial fluid of susceptible mares...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} effects of corticotherapy, in the presence and absence of uterine inflammation, on proteomics of endometrial fluid from mares susceptible to endometritis. In 11 mares, estrus was induced seven times with 5 mg PGF 2 α given at 14 -day intervals. The first estrus was a control (no treatment). During the third estrus, mares received glucocorticoid (GC) treatment (20 mg <b>isoflupredone</b> acetate) every 12 h, for three consecutive days. The fifth estrus was the Infected treatment (intrauterine infusion of 1 × 109 colony-forming unit/mL Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus). Finally, the seventh was a combination of GC + Infected treatment (infusion of bacteria 24 h after the first GC treatment). At 12 h after the end of each treatment, uterine samples were collected and submitted to two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 D-PAGE) for protein separation and mass spectrometry. Both GC treatment and uterine lumen infection induced proteomic alterations in the endometrial fluid of susceptible mares, characterized by an increase, decrease, or both in the relative optic density and/or frequency of inflammatory acute phase proteins (APP), with major alterations occurring when corticotherapy was applied in the presence of an infectious process. Corticotherapy in the presence of infection increased α 1 -antitrypsin (AAT), transthyretin (TT), and actin, but reduced immunoglobulin G, whereas intrauterine infection increased haptoglobin (Hp) and apolipoprotein A- 1 (ApoA- 1) and decreased transferrin (TF). Infection reduced levels of α 1 -antitrypsin and transthyretin, whereas corticotherapy in the presence of infection increased their frequency. We concluded that GC influenced the immune response, not only as suppressors, but also as enhancers of local defense mechanisms, through an immunomodulatory action. Short-term corticotherapy could be beneficial for treatment of uterine infectious processes in the mare...|$|E
40|$|The {{records of}} 14 cases of bovine hypokalaemia {{observed}} between 1983 and 1996 were reviewed. The most common histo-ry included a protracted, often infectious, disease. All age groups were represented. Although previously reported as a risk factor, <b>isoflupredone</b> acetate {{had not been}} administered to five of the cases. The following clinical signs were recorded in 10 cases: abnormal position {{of the head and}} neck, severe weakness, rumen hypomotility or atony, abnormal faeces, anorexia and tachycardia. Cardiac dysrhythmia was observed in six cases. Acid-base imbalance (alkalosis in 10 cases), hyperglycaemia and increased activities of aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase were associated with hypokalaemia ranging from 1 - 35 to 2 - 49 mmol/litre. Treatments included symptomatic treatment, supportive care and potassium chloride given intravenously and orally at an average total daily dose of 42 g/ 100 kg bodyweight (26 g by mouth and 16 g intravenously) for an average of five days. Eleven cases recovered after an average of three days. HYPOKALAEMIA is common in cattle with anorexia and/or digestive stasis (Carlson 1989). In most cases, it is not severe and is not associated with any clinical signs. Potassium is the most important intracellular cation (Guyton and Hall 1996 a) because its concentration gradient between the intra- and extracellular com-partments determines the resting cellular membrane potential. Potassium therefore plays a role in the formation and transmission of action potentials (Guyton and Hall 1996 b) and as a result the clinical signs associated with severe hypokalaemia can be multi-systemic. They include defects in urine concentrating ability (human, dog, cat), electrocardiographic abnormalities, arrhyth-mias (human, dog, cat, cattle, horse), flaccid paralysis (human, dog, cat, cattle), depressive reactions (anorexia, depressed mood) (human), acute brain syndromes (memory impairment, disorienta-tion, confusion) (human), paralytic ileus (human, dog, cat, cattle), decreased gastric acid concentration (human), and carbohydrat...|$|E
