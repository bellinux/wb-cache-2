5|$|Alice's sister, Melisende, Fulk's wife, persuaded Fulk {{to allow}} Alice {{to return to}} Antioch in 1135. Alice wanted to tighten the {{relationship}} of the principality and the Byzantine Empire; therefore, she offered Constance's <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> Manuel, a son of the Byzantine Emperor, John II Komnenos. To prevent the Byzantine marriage, Fulk sent his envoy France to Raymond of Poitiers to urge him to come to Antioch, which he did, traveling in disguise, because RogerII of Sicily wanted to capture him in southern Italy.|$|E

When shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw his <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> his right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E

Blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior.|$|E

This occurred just a week after a similar incident against Fulham where the goal was disallowed.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This study {{investigates the}} rate of {{norovirus}} transfer from contaminated <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> small fruits by replicating two negligent worker scenarios surrounding restroom use in a harvest setting. In the absence of hand sanitation, contamination of fruit by both an ill worker and a healthy worker subsequently using the same restroom facilities as the ill worker is demonstrated. Specifically, we examined: • The rate of transfer between norovirus soiled or contaminated: o toilet paper <b>to</b> <b>hands</b> o <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> restroom door handles o soiled <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> fruits o door handles <b>to</b> previously clean <b>hands</b> o previously clean <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> fruits • We then determine the likelihood of transfer when o An ill person uses the restroom, leaves the restroom without washing their hands and subsequently handles a food item o a healthy person touches a door handle that has been previously contaminated by an il...|$|R

Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E

While these have been less commercially successful than his work with Caedmon's Call, Webb has had more of a free <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> shape his work to his vision.|$|E
5|$|In Ong Ah Chuan and the {{subsequent}} decision Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor (1981), the Privy Council declined to set out a comprehensive list of fundamental rules of natural justice and merely stated some principles {{to deal with the}} issues at hand. At a 2000 conference, the Attorney-General Chan Sek Keong, who became Chief Justice in 2006, remarked that this gives the Court of Appeal a free <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> determine the scope of the fundamental rules of natural justice unencumbered by precedent.|$|E
