5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 led to public {{skepticism about the}} free market consensus even from some on the economic right. In March 2008, Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, announced {{the death of the}} dream of global free-market capitalism. In the same month macroeconomist James K. Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack against the consensus for monetarist economics and argued that Keynesian economics were far more relevant <b>for</b> <b>tackling</b> the emerging crises.|$|E
5|$|When Canada {{entered the}} First World War in 1914, the {{government}} became concerned that national security might be threatened, either by immigrants who still sympathised with {{their home countries}} in central Europe, or from citizens of the United States with German or Irish backgrounds crossing over the border. The authorities introduced new war-time secrecy regulations, including the censorship of the press. The responsibility <b>for</b> <b>tackling</b> these tasks {{was assigned to the}} federal Dominion Police but they had very limited resources; indeed, before the war they had often had to hire private detectives from the United States. The Dominion Police therefore delegated much of their responsibilities to local police forces, including, in the cases of the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, to the mounted police.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of the Great Depression, in 1933, Keynes {{published}} The Means to Prosperity, which contained specific policy recommendations <b>for</b> <b>tackling</b> unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending. The Means to Prosperity contains one of the first mentions of the multiplier effect. While it was addressed chiefly to the British Government, it also contained advice for other nations affected by the global recession. A copy was sent to the newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other world leaders. The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments, and according to Robert Skidelsky, helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas, though it had little immediate practical influence. In the 1933 London Economic Conference opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon.|$|E

The Means to Prosperity contains one of the first mentions of the multiplier effect. Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money was published in 1936, and served as a theoretical justification for the interventionist policies Keynes favoured <b>for</b> <b>tackling</b> a recession.|$|E

25|$|Clinical {{trials are}} a means {{through which the}} {{healthcare}} industry tests a new drug, treatment, or medical device. The traditional methodology behind clinical trials consists of various phases in which the emerging product undergoes a series of intense tests, most of which tend to occur on interested and/or compliant patients. The U.S. government has an established network <b>for</b> <b>tackling</b> {{the emergence of new}} products in the healthcare industry. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not conduct trials on new drugs coming from pharmaceutical companies. Along with the FDA, the National Institutes of Health sets the guidelines for all kinds of clinical trials relating to infectious diseases. For cancer, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsors a series or cooperative groups like CALGB and COG in order to standardize protocols for cancer treatment.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September, Benfica signed Bryan Cristante and {{extended}} Sílvio's loan. On 11 September, Benfica signed Jonas. On 12 September, after the early {{break for the}} Euro 2016 qualifying, Benfica returned with a 0–5 win at Vitória de Setúbal, with a hat-trick from Talisca, in his first goals in the Primeira Liga. Furthermore, Samaris and Cristante made their debuts for Benfica, while Ola John scored his first goal in the league. On 16 September, in the first matchday of the Champions League, Benfica lost 0–2 to Zenit. Hulk scored, Artur was sent off for a foul on Danny outside of the box, and former Benfica player Witsel scored the second goal. It was Benfica's first home defeat in 51 matches, and the first home defeat in the Champions League since 2 October 2012. On 21 September, Benfica struggled to defeat Moreirense, suffering an early goal from João Pedro in the debut of Júlio César. In the second half, after Marcelo Oliveira was sent off <b>for</b> <b>tackling</b> Talisca, Eliseu scored from 30 meters out; eight minutes later Maxi Pereira untied the match; and in the final minutes Lima scored from penalty kick after being tackled in the box. On 27 September, Benfica won at Estoril (2–3) with two goals from Talisca and one from Lima. Winning 0–2, the Eagles allowed Estoril to tie the match, with goals from Diogo Amado and Kléber, but in an individual effort from Derley, Lima scored the winning goal.|$|E
25|$|Few, {{even in the}} Labour Party, gave Robinson {{much chance}} of winning the presidency, not least because of an {{internal}} party row over her nomination. With the Labour Party the first name for a possible candidate was an elderly former minister for Health, and hero to the left, Noel Browne. Browne was a household name for having done {{more than anybody else}} in Ireland <b>for</b> <b>tackling</b> Tuberculosis in the 1950s. However Browne's relationship with the Labour Party had been stormy. He was critical of its ties with Fine Gael and had co-founded the short lived Socialist Labour Party in 1977 after leaving the Labour Party. Although he was supported by left wing members within Labour such as Michael D. Higgins, he had little or no contact with Dick Spring and therefore had to live in hope of being nominated without the endorsement of the party leadership. The possibility that Browne might be nominated raised the possibility of an internal argument within the party. The fact that Browne was enthusiastic for candidacy, in a contest where Labour never before contested, now acted as pressure for Labour to find a candidate. Spring did not feel that he could control Browne {{for the duration of the}} election, given Browne's history of defying party policy to such a degree that Browne had to leave several political parties. In these circumstances the decision to propose Robinson proved to be politically inspired. Robinson had an advantage in being the first candidate nominated for the election (and the first female), in that she could cover more meetings, public addresses and interviews. However she refused to be drawn on specifics in case she would alienate possible support. Robinson also received the backing of the Irish Times newspaper, and this proved hugely advantageous.|$|E

[...] The Guardian Aida Edemariam said of the beginning of the storyline: [...] "what is most disturbing, watching [...] first scenes together, is not the sexuality of the situation per se, though that is uncomfortable - it's the subtle blackmail with which he keeps her in line.

500|$|After {{the end of}} the siege, PC Trevor Lock {{was widely}} {{considered}} a hero. He was awarded the George Medal, the United Kingdom's second-highest civil honour, for his conduct during the siege and <b>for</b> <b>tackling</b> Oan during the SAS raid, the only time during the siege that he drew his concealed side arm. In addition, he was honoured with the Freedom of the City of London and in a motion in the House of Commons. Police historian Michael J. Waldren, referring to the television series Dixon of Dock Green, suggested that Lock's restraint in the use of his revolver was [...] "a defining example {{of the power of the}} Dixon image", and Maurice Punch noted the contrast between Lock's actions and the highly aggressive tactics of the SAS. [...] Sergeant Tommy Palmer was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for his part in the assault, in which he shot dead a terrorist who was apparently about to throw a grenade amongst the hostages. After the operation concluded, the staff sergeant who was caught in his abseil rope was treated at St Stephen's Hospital in Fulham. He suffered serious burns to his legs, but went on to make a full recovery.|$|E
