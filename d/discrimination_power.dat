The complementary contributions of two acoustic features, i. e. the conventional vocal tract related features MFCC and the recently pro-posed vocal source related features WOCOR, for speaker identification are studied. An integrating system, which performs a score level fusion of MFCC and WOCOR with a confidence measure as the weighting param-eter, is proposed {{to take full advantage}} of the complementarity between the two features. The confidence measure is derived based on the speaker <b>discrimination</b> <b>powers</b> of MFCC and WOCOR in each individual identifi-cation trial so as to give more weight to the one with higher confidence in speaker discrimination. Experiments show that information fusion with such a confidence measure based varying weight outperforms that with a pre-trained fixed weight in speaker identification. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) is a devastating disease. While {{there is no}} cure for COPD and the lung damage associated with this disease cannot be reversed, it is still very important to diagnose it as early as possible. Objectives: In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the measurement of air trapping in the lungs from CT images to detect COPD and to evaluate its severity. Patients and Methods: Twenty-five patients and twelve normal adults were included in this study. The proposed method found volumetric changes of the lungs from inspira-tion to expiration. To this end, trachea CT images at full inspiration and expiration were compared and changes in the areas and volumes of the lungs between inspiration and expiration were used to define quantitative measures (features). Using these features, the subjects were classified into two groups of normal and COPD patients using a Bayes-ian classifier.

40|$|DETECT is a nonparametric {{procedure}} {{based on}} conditional covariances for dimensionality assessment. It {{can be used}} to assess the strength of multidimensionality in a test, to estimate the number of dimensions, and to partition items into distinct clusters that represent dimensions underlying the test. DETECT works well with test data that display simple or approximate simple structure in simulated and real data studies (e. g., Roussos & Ozbek, 2005; Zhang & Stout, 1999 b). However, its performance with data that display complex structure has only been systematically evaluated in one published study (Gierl, Leighton, & Tan, in press). The present study evaluates the performance of DETECT under conditions of both approximate simple and complex structures using simulated data. The connection between the simulated outcomes and real testing situations is also studied using data from the SAT 2005 March administration.
