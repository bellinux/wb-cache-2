It agrees well with two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations. Comment: 12 pages, Latex, 3 figure...|$|R
5000|$|Rattling or gurgling sounds while {{breathing}}, {{which may}} be loud (death rattle); breathing that is irregular and shallow; decreased number of breaths per minute; breathing that alternates between rapid and slow (caused by congestion from decreased <b>fluid</b> consumption, a <b>buildup</b> of waste products in the body, and/or a decrease in circulation to the organs).|$|R
25|$|One of {{the primary}} uses of {{metolazone}} is for treating edema (fluid retention) associated with congestive heart failure (CHF). In mild heart failure, metolazone or another diuretic may be used alone, or combined with other diuretics for moderate or severe heart failure. In addition to preventing <b>fluid</b> <b>buildup,</b> the use of metolazone may allow the patient to relax the amount of sodium restriction that is required. Although most thiazide diuretics lose their effectiveness in renal failure, metolazone remains active even when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is below 30–40 mL/min (moderate renal failure) (Citation needed). This gives it a considerable advantage over other thiazide diuretics, since renal and heart failure often coexist and contribute to fluid retention.|$|E
25|$|On May 12, 2014, Sabathia {{was placed}} on the 15-day {{disabled}} list due to right knee inflammation. <b>Fluid</b> <b>buildup</b> was detected in the knee and the buildup was drained by a shot with no surgery required. Seeking a second opinion with Dr. James Andrews, he received a stem-cell shot in the knee. Sabathia was transferred to the 60-day disabled list on July 1 (retroactive to May 11) being sidelined until early to mid-July or later. After making a rehab appearance with the Double-A Trenton Thunder, Sabathia began to experience swelling in his right knee, putting his season in jeopardy. The Yankees projected that Sabathia might need microfracture surgery, which could potentially end his career. On July 16, it was announced that Sabathia's 2014 season had ended. In only 8 starts in 2014, Sabathia went 3-4 with a 5.28 ERA. He underwent surgery on July 23 to repair his degenerated knee.|$|E

50|$|Peribronchial cuffing, also {{referred}} to as peribronchial thickening or bronchial wall thickening, is a radiologic sign which occurs when excess <b>fluid</b> or mucus <b>buildup</b> in the small airway passages of the lung causes localized patches of atelectasis (lung collapse).

30|$|Continuum approximations {{of tissue}} {{consider}} responses averaged over many cells in a region. This simplified approach allows consideration of macroscopic effects, such as deformation or action potential propagation. A bidomain (sometimes known as biphasic) approach retains the macroscopic {{character of a}} continuum approximation while allowing one to consider microscopic effects; novel behavior arising from interactions between the intracellular and extracellular spaces can also be noted. I consider a spherical, single chamber heart with the new mechanical bidomain model in four separate pathologies: hypertension, hypovolemic hypotension, and hypertrophic and dilational cardiomyopathies. Analytic solutions of intracellular and extracellular displacements and hydrostatic pressures are presented; the distributions describe elastic deformation and hydrostatic <b>fluid</b> pressure <b>buildup</b> of the extracellular collagen matrix and the intracellular muscle under simplified spherical geometry. Potential applications, such as stretch activated membrane channels, are also noted.|$|R
40|$|Crushing and {{grinding}} are primary contributors {{to a high}} energy demand in the mining industry, yet, both are surprisingly inefficient processes, often with efficiencies as low as 1 %. We analyze size reductions during crushing {{and grinding}} operations and explore the potential of multiplying internal weaknesses in rock materials by non-mechanical means. In particular, when rock blocks (wet or even dry if polycrystalline) are exposed to microwaves, internal cracks can develop along grain boundaries via differential thermal expansion between grains and volumetric thermal expansion of water in pores. Brazilian tests conducted on granite and cement mortar specimens show that the tensile strength decreases proportional to the duration of microwave treatment. Thermal changes, excessive <b>fluid</b> pressure <b>buildup</b> and induced stresses are analyzed {{in the context of}} hydro-Thermo-mechanically coupled processes. Results confirm that both differential thermal expansion of mineral grains and volumetric thermal expansion of water can generate cracks upon microwave exposure. Optimal conditions are suggested to lower the combined consumption of electric and mechanical energy...|$|R
500|$|Through July 15, Molina led the NL with a [...]341 (110 hits in 323 at-bats) batting average.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to being a highly corrosive liquid, hydrofluoric acid is also a powerful contact poison. [...] Because of the ability of hydrofluoric acid to penetrate tissue, poisoning can occur readily through exposure of skin or eyes, or when inhaled or swallowed. Symptoms of exposure to hydrofluoric acid may not be immediately evident, and this can provide false reassurance to victims, causing them to delay medical treatment. Despite having an irritating odor, HF may reach dangerous levels without an obvious odor. HF interferes with nerve function, meaning that burns may not initially be painful. Accidental exposures can go unnoticed, delaying treatment and increasing the extent and seriousness of the injury. Symptoms of HF exposure include irritation of the eyes, skin, nose, and throat, eye and skin burns, rhinitis, bronchitis, pulmonary edema (<b>fluid</b> <b>buildup</b> in the lungs), and bone damage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mesentery}} is a {{thin sheet}} attached to {{the entire length of}} intestine, enclosing blood vessels, lymph nodes, and nerves. Occasionally, a small rent (hole) can form in the mesentery, through which a segment of bowel can occasionally enter. [...] As in epiploic foramen entrapment, the bowel first enlarges, since arteries do not occlude as easily as veins, which causes edema (<b>fluid</b> <b>buildup).</b> As the bowel enlarges, it becomes less and less {{likely to be able to}} exit the site of entrapment. Colic signs are referable to those seen with a strangulating lesion, such as moderate to severe abdominal pain, endotoxemia, decrease gut sounds, distended small intestine on rectal, and nasogastric reflux. This problem requires surgical correction. Survival for mesenteric rent entrapment is usually lower than other small intestinal strangulating lesions, possibly due to hemorrhage, difficulty correcting the entrapment, and the length of intestine commonly involved, with <50% of cases surviving until discharge.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCO 2 -Plume Geothermal (CPG) {{technology}} involves injecting CO 2 into natural, highly permeable geologic {{units to}} extract energy. The subsurface CO 2 absorbs {{heat from the}} reservoir, buoyantly rises to the surface, and drives a power generation system. The CO 2 is then cooled and reinjected underground. Here, we analyze the effects of multi-layered geologic reservoirs on CPG system performance by examining the CO 2 mass fraction in the produced <b>fluid,</b> pore-fluid pressure <b>buildup</b> during operation, and heat energy extraction rates. The produced CO 2 mass fraction depends on the stratigraphic positions of highly permeable layers which also affect the pore-fluid pressure drop across the reservoir...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{estimating}} {{the quantity of}} microorganisms present in hemodialysis fluid, a blood agar surface-spread plate method and a total-count water tester device impregnated with modified standard plate count agar (Millipore Corp., Bedford, Mass.), were evaluated. Both methods exhibited comparable precision; however, colony counts obtained with the total-count water tester were consistently and unacceptably low. The need for routine quantitative microbiological monitoring of hemodialysis fluids such as that recommended by the American Public Health Association was {{not supported by the}} results of this study. Such testing was not of value in predicting untoward reactions for patients undergoing hemodialysis, nor did quantitative testing of hemodialysis <b>fluids</b> identify the <b>buildup</b> of potentially hazardous levels of contamination within hemodialysis systems. Finally, the kinds of organisms found in hemodialysis systems, i. e., gram-negative water-borne bacilli, were elucidated...|$|R

Typeset using REVTEX 1 In most studies of rapid granular flows, also called the granular gas regime [1], the inelasticity of granular collisions {{is assumed to be}} the most important feature that distinguishes these flows from usual liquid or gas flows. The dynamics is modeled by a single inelasticity parameter ǫ = 1 − α 2, where α is the coefficient of normal restitution. As a consequence a granular flow can only be maintained in driven systems, where energy is put into the system e. g. by gravity, shear or in vibrated layers [1]. Also quite some work has been done on the freely evolving granular fluid [2 – 6], which has been shown to be linearly unstable (onset of clustering instability) with respect to spatial fluctuations in density, δn(r, t) = n(r, t) − 〈n〉 [2].

40|$|AbstractSequestration {{of carbon}} dioxide (CO 2) in deep saline {{aquifers}} {{has emerged as a}} mitigation strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. The large amounts of supercritical CO 2 that need to be injected into deep saline aquifers may cause large <b>fluid</b> pressure <b>buildup.</b> The resulting overpressure will produce changes in the effective stress field. This will deform the rock and may promote reactivation of sealed fractures or the creation of new ones in the caprock seal, which could lead to escape paths for CO 2. To understand these coupled hydromechanical phenomena, we model an axisymmetric horizontal aquifer-caprock system. We study plastic strain propagation patterns using a viscoplastic approach. Simulations illustrate that plastic strain may propagate through the whole thickness of the caprock if horizontal stress is lower than vertical stress. In contrast, plastic strain concentrates in the contact between the aquifer and the caprock if horizontal stress is larger than vertical stress. Aquifers that present a low-permeability boundary experience an additional fluid pressure increase once the pressure buildup cone reaches the outer boundary. However, fluid pressure does not evolve uniformly in the aquifer. While it increases in the low-permeability boundary, it drops {{in the vicinity of the}} injection well because of the lower viscosity of CO 2. Thus, caprock stability does not get worse in semi-closed aquifers compared to open aquifers. Overall, the caprock acts as a plate that bends because of pressure buildup, producing a horizontal extension of the upper part of the caprock. This implies a vertical compression of this zone, which may produce settlements instead of uplift in low-permeability (k≤ 10 − 18  m 2) caprocks at early times of injection...|$|R
40|$|Copper-bearing breccia {{pipes in}} the Redbank area {{intersect}} an interbedded sequence of igneous and dolomitic sedimentary rocks which have undergone {{various degrees of}} meta-somatism. The steeply inclined breccia pipes are of small size and cylindrical form and typically show in situ brecciation. The breccia matrix and associated veins consist essentially of various proportions of microbreccia, dolomite. quartz, chlorite, celadonite, hematite, K-feldspar, apatite, and chalcopyrite, with nilnor barite, futile, galena, and pyrobitumen. K-metasomatism is most intense {{in the vicinity of}} the breccia pipes and associated veining, and there is mineralogical and textural evidence indicating that fluids enriched in K, C 1, P, Mg, Ce, La, CO 2, and H 20 were introduced at the time of breccia-pipe formation. Carbonate and sulfide minerals from brecciated and metasomatized rocks at lower strati-graphic levels have isotopic compositions consistent with magmatic hydrothermal deriva-tion. However, the 8 xaC values of the great bulk of the dolomite in the breccia pipes indicate remobilization of sedimentary carbonate. Furthermore, the sulfur isotope ratios of the main sulfide mineralization, which occurs near the top of the brecciated sequence, are variable and generally enriched in a*S relative to the minor amounts of sulfide at lower levels. It is concluded that the breccia pipes formed by explosive release of <b>fluids</b> following the <b>buildup</b> of significant over-pressure in a postulated carbonated, K-rich trachytic magma at depths of roughly 2 to 3 km beneath the surface. This was accompanied by intense metasomatism and precipitation of some carbonate and sulfide minerals which partly infilled the open spaces. The thermal gradients and fracturing caused extensive circulation of connate brine (and possibly descending sea water). The brine remobilized sedimentary and magmatic hydrothermal components in and around the pipes and copper mineralization in the Redbank area mainly precipitated from this brine...|$|R
