We {{will get more}} tankers in, we will get more bowsers in, we will get more regular filling of them, {{and at the same}} time, more bottled water will be provided." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> {{feathers}} for Father Marty's bed, you know. I haven't shot as many yet {{as would}} make a pillow for a cradle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Somehow, I didn't cotton to {{him from}} the beginning. 'Well, I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> other side of it,' I says, 'and unless you know any patent way of getting over a hill without going up it, I reckon I am.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well {{we had a}} right nice time together. I {{gave him}} part of my lunch, an' then {{he wanted me to}} come back with him; but I told him I'd <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{telegraph}} office----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Start her up, quick!" [...] {{he said to}} his brothers, in a low voice. [...] "Something is wrong! We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> after <b>the</b> girls right away!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>the</b> thing's <b>to</b> <b>get</b> started," [...] Habert exclaimed, {{looking at}} his watch. [...] "It's midnight now. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river and <b>get</b> a boat--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, if I {{want to ask}} him {{anything}} I have to write it. I'm slow at writing, and bad at writing, and he isn't always patient. However, as you reminded me just now, I have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> things ready. To cut it short, perhaps I might say that I didn't quite expect the tea-party would come off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But Colonel!" [...] implored Hawkins; [...] "stop and think; don't be rash; {{you know}} it's {{the only chance}} we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> money; and besides, the Bible itself says posterity to the fourth {{generation}} shall be punished for the sins and crimes committed by ancestors four generations back that hadn't {{anything to do with}} them; and so it's only fair to turn the rule around and make it work both ways." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{excitement}} of that last little bit was 'orrible. Fust {{of all we}} 'ad <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> mattress, and then in some way we 'ad {{got to get rid}} o' Jimmy. Bill's idea was for me to take 'im ashore with me and tell 'im that Bill would join us arterwards, and then lose 'im; but I said that till I'd got my share I couldn't bear to lose sight o' Bill's honest face for 'alf a second.|$|E
6000|$|... "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at <b>the</b> books, Miller,--that's {{all there}} is to it. I told you so the other day. Well, we've found out a way, I think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm whippin' 'er, if yer want to know," [...] was the carter's reply. [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up <b>the</b> 'ill, 'aven't I? Garn {{and mind}} yer own business!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One of two things, Jim, hez <b>got</b> <b>to</b> happen," [...] he said, huskily. [...] "Either {{that there}} rock hez <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off <b>the</b> road, or I have. I've seed HIM on it agin!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nobody {{can help}} you, if I {{understand}} the matter rightly. You have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> better {{of your own}} covetousness and evil desires, and {{you are in the}} fair way to get the better of them if you have already refused to be this man's wife because you could not bring yourself to commit the sin of marrying him when you did not love him. I suppose that is about the truth of it; and indeed, indeed, I do sympathise with you. If you have done that, though it is no more than the plainest duty, I will love you for it. One finds so few people that will do any duty that taxes their self-indulgence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now then, Tom, {{you may as}} {{well take}} post here at once. I will send Sam or Ben up to watch with you. I don't think there is a shadow of chance of their coming to-night, but there is never any {{answering}} for red-skins. I would leave Hunting Dog with you, but we shall want him to help make the framework for the canoes; the Indians are a deal handier than we are in making lashings. I will send your supper up here, lad, and your buffalo robes. Then you can take it by turns to watch and sleep. I reckon we shall be at work all night; we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> job finished as quick as we can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then says he, 'Would {{you mind}} steppin' {{down to the}} lake?' I didn't mind, and went with him, {{and when we got}} down to the water there was their boat drawed up on the shore and pretty nigh full of water. 'Mr. Clyde brought this boat back the other day,' says he, 'from a place where he left it some {{distance}} down the lake, and I wonder he didn't sink before he got here. We must try and calk up some of the open seams; but first we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> water out of her.' So sayin', he squatted down on {{the ground in front of}} the boat and took hold of it, one hand on one side of the bow and one on the other, and then he gave a big twist, and just turned the boat clean over, water and all, so that it lay with its bottom up, and the water running down into the lake like a little deluge.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{seems to}} me that we should be interferin' with ourselves. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into <b>the</b> Army or--get out, haven't we? King's hired by the Council to teach us. All the rest's gumdiddle. Can't you see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure! But it's always {{closed at}} night," [...] snapped Reddy. [...] "Besides, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> that or <b>the</b> door either, you have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> inside <b>the</b> henyard, and there's a gate {{to that which}} we can't open." ...|$|R

5000|$|D'Allesandro {{stated that}} Smith took {{the comic book}} {{pictures}} to his preschool, which pushed teachers to have a [...] "superhero week". Smith's grandfather, New Hampshire senator Lou D'Allesandro, stated, [...] "This is a feel good moment, it's a feel good story, and we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> world to recognize that." [...] In March 2013, Smith attended an event at the Center for Hearing and Communication to debut a poster.|$|E
5000|$|In Delaware, {{where as}} much as nearly {{a foot of snow}} fell and winds of up to 35 mph, drivers faced {{extremely}} poor visibility, which caused dozens of cars to spin out during the day on roadways. As the snowfall ended, Delaware Department Transportation spokesman Jim Westhoff released a statement stating [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> roads in pretty good shape before that Monday morning.”, because of the risk of slippery roads.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into <b>the</b> brown-canvas pack that's patched with moose-hide. You'll find a {{few pounds}} of lumpy gold. You've never seen gold like it in the country, nor has anybody else. Here's what you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do. Listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house. You needn't be in a {{tremendous}} hurry, because papa has only {{just come in}} from haymaking. They've got up the last load, {{and there has been}} the usual ceremony. Emily and I have been looking at them." ...|$|R
60|$|But he {{remained}} too late. The inner gate was locked, and the lodge closed. After a little fruitless knocking with his hand, {{he was standing}} there with the disagreeable conviction upon {{him that he had}} <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through <b>the</b> night, when a voice accosted him from behind.|$|R
5000|$|John Pappageorge, a Republican state {{legislator}} in Michigan {{said in the}} summer of 2004, [...] "If we do not suppress the Detroit vote, we're going to have a tough time in this election." [...] Pappageorge later claimed he was taken out of context saying, [...] "In the context that we were talking about, I said we’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> vote up in Oakland (County) and the vote down in Detroit. You get it down with a good message." ...|$|E
5000|$|Salinger {{was one of}} the {{managers}} of Robert Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. After the Kennedy was assimated in June, Salinger was 10 to 12 ft away from him. Salinger claimed that Jim McManus, who was also working on the campaign, said to him, [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> message to Los Angeles, under no circumstances should Bobby go through that (Ambassador Hotel) kitchen ... there's usually grease on the floor. He's going to fall or something." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{disagreement}} between Judd and Indy race car driver Milka Duno {{took place during}} the 2007 IndyCar season. After the final race, she stated to the media: [...] "I know this is not very sportsmanlike, but they've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> 23 car (Duno) off the track. It's very dangerous. I'm tired of holding my tongue. She shouldn't be out there. When a car is 10 miles (an hour) off the pace, it's not appropriate to be racing. People's lives are at stake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lake somehow," [...] said Snap. [...] "So <b>the</b> {{sooner we}} <b>get</b> at <b>the</b> job the better. Don't grumble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I'm {{about as}} {{comfortable}} as could be expected. Anyhow, I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> used <b>to</b> <b>the</b> thing. Six weeks is the shortest limit, isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is right," [...] Captain Bayley said, [...] "we {{will travel}} together, my dear sir; for {{of course we}} shall go {{straight}} back to England now. We have been dawdling about in this wretched country long enough. Besides, {{everything has to be}} arranged, and we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of this matter; so if you have no objection, we will travel home together. If the young people here want to dawdle about any longer they can do so; I dare say they can look after themselves, or if not, I can make an arrangement with some old lady or other to act as Alice's chaperon." ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the last}} years of his life, as he {{struggled}} with myeloma, he founded the Lenny Zakim Fund to fight poverty and racism in Boston. Shortly before his death, he organized a Catholic-Jewish pilgrimage to Rome with his friend Cardinal Bernard Law, where he had an audience with Pope John Paul II, prompting the New Jersey native to say: [...] "I've had my picture taken with the Pope, Bruce Springsteen and the Dalai Lama. Now I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> three of them together." ...|$|E
5000|$|During a radio {{interview}} on March 30, 2004, Hornung, {{speaking about the}} recent lack of football success at Notre Dame, said, [...] "We can't stay as strict as we are {{as far as the}} academic structure is concerned because we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> black athletes. We must get the black athletes if we're going to compete." [...] The response was immediate. The University replied, [...] "We strongly disagree with the thesis of his remarks. They are generally insensitive and specifically insulting to our past and current African-American student-athletes." [...] Famed former Notre Dame head coach Ara Parseghian also disagreed with Hornung, saying that Notre Dame didn't lower admission standards for him.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the course}} of The Ice Dreams broadcast, a number of {{suggestions}} were presented by the hosts to the audience {{in order to make}} the holding of the Winter Games possible at Smiggin. For example, in order to provide a tall enough mountain for skiing events, Roy and HG proposed that either Mount Kosciuszko be raised 300 metres (from its current height of 2,228 metres), or that a new mountain be built in Smiggin itself, which would be named Mount Steggall, after Australian Nagano slalom bronze medalist Zali Steggall. [...] "Weve just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> nation to dump all its rubbish on top of Kosciuszko, compact it a bit and voila, Mount Steggall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't {{say that}} I am," [...] Daughtry agreed. [...] "I guess I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea an' the tropics and warm the rheumatics outa me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know better}} than to ask such a question," [...] he replied. [...] "But if we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grind, why, we might as well do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want you}} to; I {{love to see}} you so young and happy, only {{you are not the}} old David, and I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> acquainted with <b>the</b> new one." ...|$|R
