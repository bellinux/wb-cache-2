They foreign workers were forced to live in slum houses with 20 others and to sometimes share mattresses. The Ombudsman found that much of the work was [...] "off the books" [...] with the foreign workers paid in cash and that the labour hire companies that Baiada engaged provided inadequate, missing or fabricated records. During the course of the investigation, 23 of 39 contractors complained of financial instability and four of six principal contractors ceased trading. Baiada refused to let Fair Work inspectors into their three NSW processing plants — at Beresfield, Hanwood and Tamworth during the investigation.|$|R

During a civil war in 1612, Mulay Zidan commissioned a French privateer, Jehan Philippe de Castelane, to shift his household goods from Safi to Agadir for a sum of 3000 escudos.

A Spanish fleet of 4 ships under command of Luis Fajardo de Córdoba intercepted the vessel near Mehdya {{and took it to}} Lisbon (then part of Spain) and convicted the crew of piracy. Two years later the collection was transmitted to El Escorial for permanent storage.|$|R

5000|$|On November 19, 2005, a film, Stoned: The Wild & Wicked World of Brian Jones, premiered in London. The {{movie was}} {{directed}} by Stephen Woolley and co-produced by Nik Powell, the producing team behind Mona Lisa, Interview with the Vampire and The Crying Game. The film was [...] "based on and inspired by" [...] Guiliano's book Paint It Black: The Murder of Brian Jones, as well as Terry Rawlings' Who Killed Christopher Robin and Anna Wohlin's The Murder of Brian Jones. Producer/director Stephen Wooley {{has said that he}} saw Giuliano's book in a bookstore and brought it to the attention of his screenwriters. The screenwriters responded by asking if he had seen Rawlings' book, which Wooley then read and found to be much more detailed than Giuliano's. Wooley also interviewed Anna Wohlin, Brian Jones' last girlfriend; she wrote her own book after the interview, causing Wooley to buy the rights to her book as well as the others. Commenting on the relative importance of the diverse source material for the movie, Wooley said, [...] "In the end it wasn't so much the books, it was talking to both Anna about the state of Brian's mind that night, and Janet (a nurse who was present at Brian Jones' home on the day he died), about Frank's (the alleged murderer of Jones) state of mind that night - his instability and the fact he just been fired that <b>day</b> <b>without</b> being properly <b>paid</b> - that confirmed in my mind there was a movie here." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} short, medium, and longer run {{employment}} {{effects of a}} substantial change in the parental leave benefit program in Germany. In 2007, a means-tested parental leave transfer program that had <b>paid</b> <b>benefits</b> {{for up to two}} years was replaced by an earnings related transfer which <b>paid</b> <b>benefits</b> for up to one year. The reform generated winners and losers with heterogeneous response incentives. We find that the reform speeds up the labor market return of both groups of mothers after benefit expiration. The overall time until an average mother with (without) prior claims to benefits returns to the labor force after a birth declined after the reform by 10 (8) months at the median. We show that likely pathways for this substantial reform effect are changes in social norms and mothers' preferences for economic independence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Relatively {{little is}} known about the role that leave policies—family, parental, or maternity-leave policies—play in facilitating time off work after child-birth. Yet time off is a {{critical}} element of leave policies, as it facilitates the mother’s recovery from childbirth and promotes maternal-infant attachment. Using data from Minnesota, the state with the highest rate of female labor force participation, we examine the extent to which policies, relative to personal, job, and workplace char-acteristics, determine the duration of women’s childbirth-related leaves from work. A random sample of women identified from vital statistics records is used to estimate the relationship between leave policies and time off work after childbirth. Of our sample 85 percent had access to some <b>paid</b> leave <b>benefits,</b> although only 46 percent had <b>paid</b> maternity leave <b>benefits.</b> The difference in duration of leave between women with and <b>without</b> <b>paid</b> leave policies was approximately four weeks, a substantial dif-ference for most women and their infants. Paid leave policies and spousal earnings as primary determinants of maternal time off work, suggest problems in the use of unpaid leave for economically vulnerable women. Relatively {{little is known}} about the role that workplace policies—family, parental, and maternity leave—play in facilitating women’s time off work in association with childbirth. Yet time off work may be a critical element of family, parental, and maternity leave policies, particularly in associa-tion with childbirth. A job-protected leave from work can facilitate the mother’s recovery from childbirth and the development of her relation...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a telephone health coaching and support service provided to members of an Australian private health insurance fund-Telephonic Complex Care Program (TCCP) -on hospital use and associated costs. A case-control pre-post study design was employed using propensity score matching. Private health insurance members (n= 273) who participated in TCCP between April and December 2012 (cases) were matched (1 : 1) to members who had not previously been enrolled in the program or any other disease management programs offered by the insurer (n= 232). Eligible members were community dwelling, aged ≥ 65 years, and had 2 or more hospital admissions in the 12 months prior to program enrollment. Preprogram variables that estimated the propensity score included: participant demographics, diagnoses, and hospital use in the 12 months prior to program enrollment. TCCP participants received one-to-one telephone support, personalized care plan, and referral to community-based services. Control participants continued to access usual health care services. Primary outcomes were number of hospital admission claims and total <b>benefits</b> <b>paid</b> for all health care utilizations in the 12 months following program enrollment. Secondary outcomes included change in total <b>benefits</b> <b>paid,</b> hospital <b>benefits</b> <b>paid,</b> ancillary <b>benefits</b> <b>paid,</b> and total hospital bed days over the 12 months post enrollment. Compared with matched controls, TCCP did not appear to reduce health care utilization or <b>benefits</b> <b>paid</b> in the 12 months following program enrollment. However, program characteristics and implementation may have impacted its effectiveness. In addition, challenges related to evaluating complex health interventions such as TCCP are discussed...|$|R
