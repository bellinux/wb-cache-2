Currently, no effective {{load balancing}} system {{is available to}} handle the <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> in a BGP multi-homed stub network, where the traffic volume is unknown to the network and {{the route of the}} traffic is hard to control. In this paper, we propose ILBO, an <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> load balancing mechanism to effectively balance the <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> in a BGP multi-homed stub network. ILBO predicts and schedules the <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> based on outbound traffic. It also provides an <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> control scheme that can guarantee the successful execution of the traffic scheduling. ...|$|R

40|$|Multi-homing is {{a network}} {{configuration}} that connects a customer network to multiple service providers. It {{is used to}} improve fault-tolerance and throughput. One of its problems {{is the lack of}} dynamic load-balancing for <b>inbound</b> network <b>traffic</b> to multi-homed networks, which prohibits us from taking advantage of multi-homing to improve reliability for <b>inbound</b> network <b>traffic.</b> This paper proposes a new routing architecture and a protocol, BGP-MHLB/I (BGP-Multi-Home Load Balancing/Inbound), to realize dynamic load-balancing for <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> to multi-homed networks. Our analysis found approximately 80 multiple BGP paths available between two customer networks for up to two extra AS-hop paths. This finding suggests that the proposed BGP-MHLB/I routing will be an effective solution for improving reliability in the Internet...|$|R
40|$|The prime {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to analyze the historical patterns of inbound general freight to Newfoundland by mode of transport, to identify the socio-economic factors which chiefly influence the <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic,</b> and to develop and test a forecasting model. A secondary objective was to investigate and test several non-causal forecasting techniques whose results could be compared with those of the model tested. [...] The approach to this transportation planning topic was guided by the well developed method of analysis used in traffic engineering and urban transportation planning. Having reviewed the literature and collected a suitable data set, a preliminary statistical analysis was conducted. This was followed by the application of linear regression with the appropriate testing of the underlying assumptions using the t-test, the F-test and the Bartlett's test. Other methods used included the calculation of simple ratios of traffic volume to the various socio-economic factors, and time series and smoothing techniques. [...] The historical pattern of general freight to Newfoundland has demonstrated constant growth over the last 20 years with considerable variability in the split between the rail, truck and direct shipping modes. Current <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> by all modes is in the order of 1 million tonnes annually. Using multiple linear regression, the combination of population and the value of retail trade was found to influence the <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> to the greatest extent. Simple ratios of <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> to selected socio-economic employment ratio demonstrated the least difference between forecast and actual value. [...] The best straight line fit was found to be the combination of population and the value of retail trade with the use of regression analysis. The resulting equation had an R-Square of 80...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we will analyze the {{relations}} between outbound email and <b>inbound</b> email <b>traffic.</b> We consider outbound traffic being sending email using the SMTP and <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> being receiving or retrieving email using POP or IMAP.

40|$|Abstract—TCP {{remains the}} {{dominant}} transport protocol for Internet traffic, but {{the preponderance of}} its congestion control mechanisms in determining flow throughput is often disputed. This paper analyzes {{the extent to which}} network, host and application settings define flow throughput over time and across autonomous systems. Drawing from a longitudinal study spanning five years of passive traces collected from a single transit link, our results show that continuing OS upgrades have reduced the influence of host limitations owing both to windowscale deployment, which by 2011 covered 80 % of <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic,</b> and increased socket buffer sizes. On the other hand, we show that for this data set, approximately half of all <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> remains throttled by constraints beyond network capacity, challenging the traditional model of congestion control in TCP traffic as governed primarily by loss and delay.

40|$|We {{present an}} active {{measurement}} {{study of the}} routing dynamics induced by AS-path prepending, a common method for controlling the <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> of a multi-homed ISP. Unlike other inter-domain <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> engineering methods, AS-path prepending not only provides network resilience but does not increase routing table size. Unfortunately, ISPs often perform prepending on a trail-and-error basis, {{which can lead to}} suboptimal results and to a large amount of network churn. We study these effects by actively injecting prepended routes into the Internet routing system using the RIPE NCC RIS route collectors and observing the resulting changes from almost 200 publicly-accessible sources of BGP information. Our results show that our prepending methods are simple and effective and that a small number of ASes is often responsible for large amounts of the route changes caused by prepending. Furthermore, we show that our methods are able to reveal hidden prepending policies to prepending and tie-breaking decisions made by ASes; this is useful for further predicting the behavior of prepending. ...|$|R

40|$|Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) {{attacks have}} emerged as a popular means of causing mass {{targeted}} service disruptions, often for extended periods of time. The relative ease and low costs of launching such attacks, supplemented by the current inadequate sate of any viable defense mechanism, have made them {{one of the top}} threats to the Internet community today. Since the increasing popularity of web-based applications has led to several critical services being provided over the Internet, it is imperative to monitor the network traffic so as to prevent malicious attackers from depleting the resources of the network and denying services to legitimate users. This paper first presents a brief discussion on some of the important types of DDoS attacks that currently exist and some existing mechanisms to combat these attacks. It then points out the major drawbacks of the currently existing defense mechanisms and proposes a new mechanism for protecting a web-server against a DDoS attack. In the proposed mechanism, incoming traffic to the server is continuously monitored and any abnormal rise in the <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> is immediately detected. The detection algorithm is based on a statistical analysis of the <b>inbound</b> <b>traffic</b> on the server and a robust hypothesis testing framework.
