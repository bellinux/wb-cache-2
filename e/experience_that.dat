5|$|Abraham Lincoln's service {{during the}} Black Hawk War {{has been a}} source of {{discrepancies}} and questioning, with two major battle sites being affiliated with Lincoln in the aftermath of combat. A number of sources assert that on June 26, 1832, the morning after the second battle, members of the company of Captain Jacob M. Early arrived at Kellogg's Grove to help bury the dead. One of the soldiers in the company was Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln assisted with the burial and later made a statement about the <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> has been connected with both the battle at Kellogg's Grove and the fight at Stillman's Run.|$|E

As of April 2015, riders must pass through metal detectors and security personnel and must rid themselves of all loose items from their pockets.|$|E

In the same year, he was invited by the Government of Pakistan to take charge as Principal of Comilla Victoria College in East Pakistan, a position he held until 1958. During this time (1950–58) he also served as President of the East Pakistan Non-Government Teachers' Association.|$|E

5|$|In the Sikh {{religious}} text the Guru Granth Sahib, religious {{language is}} used symbolically and metaphorically. In the text, Sikh Gurus repeat that the experiences they have while meditating are ineffable, incognizable, incomprehensible, and transensuous– {{this means that}} there is no object of their <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> can be conceptualised. To overcome this, the Sikh Gurus used symbolic and metaphorical language, assuming that there is a resemblance between the mystical experience of the divine (the sabad) and those experiencing it. For example, light is used to refer to the spiritual reality.|$|E

I believe if Detroit was demolished, it would be a good step toward giving some, at least, temporary ease to this country.|$|E

In this chapter, we conceptualize the phenomenon of postgame <b>experiences,</b> <b>that</b> is, <b>experiences</b> gamers have once they stopped playing. We propose and tackle two types of postgame experiences: shortterm postgame <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> arise immediately after game play and long-term postgame <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> occur after repeatedly and intensively playing a particular game or game genre. We present two focus group studies that offered qualitative insights into which postgame experiences are at play, to what extent, and under which conditions. The chapter concludes with a discussion and recommendations for future research...|$|R

5|$|Le Guin's father Alfred Louis Kroeber was an anthropologist, and the <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> {{this gave}} Le Guin {{influenced}} {{all of her}} works. The protagonists of many of Le Guin's novels, such as The Left Hand of Darkness and Rocannon's World, are also anthropologists or social investigators of some kind. Le Guin uses the term Ekumen for her fictional alliance of worlds, a term coined by her father, who derived it from the Greek Oikoumene to refer to Eurasian cultures that shared a common origin.|$|E
5|$|Madsen's {{idea was}} to bring {{attention}} {{to the story of}} Flammen and Citron as he felt it had been neglected or misrepresented. The most expensive Danish film produced to that date, it was co-produced by German companies because initially there was no interest in producing the film in Denmark. Portraying the protagonists as morally ambiguous characters, the director tried to depict war as a complicated <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> goes beyond a good versus evil dichotomy. With visual and narrative references borrowed from film noir and the French film Army of Shadows, Flame & Citron also explores themes of love, betrayal, and the emotional aspects of relationships.|$|E
5|$|Many American {{pilots who}} took part in World War II grew up during the 1930s enthusiastically reading flying pulps such as Flying Aces, and were captivated by the {{adventure}} stories, an <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> no doubt played a part in their decision to become military aviators themselves. Joseph W. Rutter, a pilot in the Army Air Force in 1944, recalls this vividly in his book Wreaking Havoc: A Year in an A-20, as does First Blue, the biography of Roy Marlin Voris, World War II ace and two-time commander of the Blue Angels.|$|E

5|$|Norman pioneered {{a form of}} past-life therapy, {{teaching}} her disciples how to recall details of experiences from their past incarnations. These recollections contributed to the group's mythology, which developed over time with student input. Unarius' members occasionally recalled crimes that they had committed in past lives, including times they harmed incarnations of Ruth Norman. The students sometimes acted out and filmed scenes from their previous incarnations, an <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> participants found therapeutic; they cited this benefit as proof that the events were real. Norman's therapy, according to R. George Kirkpatrick of San Diego State University and Tumminia, differed from most New Age past-life therapies {{in the way that}} it wove her followers into the group's narrative.|$|E

The princess shook Merrick's hand and sat with him, an <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> left him overjoyed.

5|$|One action RPG that avoided these {{limitations}} is Deus Ex (2000), designed by Warren Spector.

This produced a unique <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> was tailored to each player. According to Spector, the game's dialogue choices were inspired by a console role-playing game, Suikoden.|$|E
