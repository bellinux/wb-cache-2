5|$|The maximum {{tenure in}} office was nine years, but {{every three years}} {{officials}} were <b>graded</b> on their performance by senior officials.

5|$|A less pure form of Limousin is bred up (also {{known as}} <b>graded</b> up) from a base animal over a defined number of generations.

British <b>graded</b> up females when they reach fourth generation from a non-Limousin base cow can then be registered as Limousins in the British Limousin Pedigree Register.
