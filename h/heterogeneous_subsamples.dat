40|$|Using the newly-constructed Post-Critical Belief Scale (Duriez, Soenens & Hutsebaut, 2005) and the Revised Death Anxiety Scale (Thorson & Powell, 1994) an {{opportunity}} sample of 216 participants (44 males and 172 females) {{took part in}} a survey study {{to examine the relationship between}} religiosity, open/closed mindedness and death anxiety. Preliminary data screening revealed significant differences between males and females on mean levels of religiousness and open/closed mindedness. Therefore, to avoid biases in regression estimates, due to <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>subsamples,</b> the male and female subsamples were analysed separately in the main regression analyses. Regression analyses for both the subsamples clearly showed that there was a consistent curvilinear trend in the relationship between religiousness and death anxiety. Similar subsample based analyses showed no relationship between the open/close mindedness dimension of the Post-Critical Beliefs Scale and death anxiety for either males or females. These results support the suspicions of Leming (1979 – 1980) that the many studies showing a linear trend between religiousness and death anxiety have been biased by restrictions in the range of scores on religiousness, and that the true relationship between religiousness and death anxiety is curvilinear...|$|E
40|$|This study assesses {{changes in}} the {{technical}} efficiency of commercial banks in Sri Lanka {{following the end of}} armed conflict in 2009. The weighted aggregate-efficiency technique, based on a group-wise <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>subsampling</b> bootstrap approach, is employed to compare efficiency levels during the periods 2007 - 2009 and 2010 - 2013. This technique allows for heterogeneity in environmental and regulatory conditions between the two periods while assuming homogeneity within each period. Our results reveal that the banking sector experienced a significant efficiency improvement post-conflict even with unprecedented branch expansion. The findings, therefore, controvert the mainstream view that bank efficiency declined with rapid industry expansion. Further, we conclude that geographical expansion of the banking sector is a viable and effective policy tool to achieve broad-based and inclusive growth for emerging economies like Sri Lanka, particularly in a period of post-conflict recovery...|$|R
30|$|Firstly, {{there is}} a {{negative}} synergetic effect of housing purchase and city integration on sense of happiness, which still exists when all the control variables are added in. Secondly, we further explore the synergetic relationship between housing status, city integration and sense of happiness in <b>heterogeneous</b> migrants’ <b>subsamples.</b> Compared with migrants who moved from developed areas to less developed areas, this negative synergetic effect is greater in migrants who moved from underdeveloped areas to developed areas. Similarly, compared with people who migrated shorter distances, this negative synergy impact on those who migrated further is more obvious. Thirdly, considering that the benchmark regression model might have problems such as omitted variables and endogeneity, this paper introduces appropriate instrumental variables such as the original regions’ urban unemployment rate in 2012 {{and whether or not}} destination regions had a housing purchase restriction policy in 2012 and then uses the CMP method to re-estimate all the hypotheses. As well, considering the main variable in this paper-city integration is constructed from multiple-dimensional indices, we try to use PCA to reduce the dimension specifically and then to estimate all the hypotheses again. Finally, we find that the results are consistent with the results of the benchmark Ologit regressions.|$|R
30|$|Using the {{benchmark}} specification, we detail several potential dimensions of heterogeneity. Hence, {{we look at}} the relationship between early retirement and technical change across education levels, occupations, sectors, marital statuses, cohorts, age groups, genders, periods of permanence in the labor force, and training experiences. These exercises serve the purpose of both illustrating the <b>heterogeneous</b> effects within <b>subsamples</b> of the data and corroborating the identification of the key coefficients in {{the benchmark}} specification. For example, the sector experience is correlated by construction with our measure of technical change and may affect the early retirement decision directly through higher pension entitlements, wage profiles, and so on. Hence, it is important to see how our key coefficients describe the same nonlinear relationship between technical change and early retirement for both high and low levels of sector experience.|$|R
40|$|A {{convenient}} and effective new approach for analyzing DWPF samples {{involves the use}} of inserts with volumes of 1. 5 [...] 3 ml placed in the neck of 14 ml sample vials. The inserts have rims that conform to the rim of the vials so that they sit straight and stable in the vial. The DWPF tank sampling system fills the pre-weighed insert rather than the entire vial, so the vial functions only as the insert holder. The shielded cell operator then removes the vial cap and decants the insert containing the sample into a plastic bottle, crucible, etc., for analysis. Inert materials such as Teflon, plastic, and zirconium are used for the insert so it is unnecessary to separate the insert from the sample for most analyses. The key technique advantage of using inserts to take DWPF samples versus filling sample vials is that it provides a {{convenient and}} almost foolproof way of obtaining and handling small volumes of slurry samples in a shielded cell without corrupting the sample. Since the insert allows the entire sample to be analyzed, this approach eliminates the errors inherent with <b>subsampling</b> <b>heterogeneous</b> slurries that comprise DWPF samples. Slurry samples can then be analyzed with confidence. Analysis times are dramatically reduced by eliminating the drying and vitrification steps normally used to produce a homogeneous solid sample. Direct dissolution and elemental analysis of slurry samples are achieved in 8 hours or less compared with 40 hours for analysis of vitrified slurry samples. Comparison of samples taken in inserts versus full vials indicate that the insert does not significantly affect sample composition...|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to fresh samples described above, 6 K# 569 R 4 - 1 is clearly hydrothermally altered, {{as indicated by}} sulfide mineralization, low CaO and K 2 O contents, low density, and the dominance of paramagnetic minerals. The saturation magnetization of ferromagnetic minerals is extremely low, indicating that this sample contains much smaller amount of ferromagnetic minerals than the other samples (Fig.  5 b). This is consistent with microscopic observations. Magnetic susceptibility of this sample is also very low (Fig.  5 a). Only small amounts of ferromagnetic minerals exist in this sample, and they display a MD-like magnetic domain state. Pyrite and chalcopyrite grains are dominant and observed as grain assemblage with widths of 50 – 100  μm along cracks in the groundmass (Fig.  4 C, D). These results indicate that fine titanomagnetite grains in groundmass are preferentially consumed and secondary sulfide minerals are crystallized during hydrothermal alteration processes. Iron in primary titanomagnetite could be moved to hydrothermal fluid, and iron and sulfur in secondary sulfides are derived from hydrothermal fluid. Although other possibilities such as silicate iron dissolution and seawater reduction as sulfur origin should be carefully considered, the absence of titanomagnetite grains in the samples studied here at least suggests that their alteration has supplied iron content into the fluid to promote secondary sulfide mineralization. Surely, the NRM intensity is less than 1 A/m on average (Fig.  5 a), and the AFD result shows unstable remanence without linear trend (Fig.  6 d). Moreover, NRM intensities are <b>heterogeneous</b> within cubic <b>subsamples,</b> indicating {{that the degree of}} alteration during hydrothermal processes differs spatially within lava flows. This is completely different from fresh samples of SD-like (6 K# 569 R 4 - 2) and MD-like (6 K# 562 R 1) end members, suggesting that igneous process cannot produce heterogeneity as seen in hydrothermal alteration process. The grain density of this sample (2.71  g/cm 3) is also lower than those of the two fresh samples (both 2.89  g/cm 3), which appears to be driven by the contribution of clay minerals. It is noteworthy that titanomagnetite grains in groundmass diminish along with considerable NRM reduction and sulfide mineralization in alteration halo, but hydrothermal alteration is not progressed in silicate phenocrysts (Fig.  4 B). This result implies that main remanence carrier of fine titanomagnetite grains in groundmass were altered at an early stage of hydrothermal alteration. Sample 6 K# 569 R 4 - 3 can be classified as an example of partly altered volcanic rock in which hydrothermal fluid is reacted with titanomagnetite grains in groundmass. Fresh part shows the presence of titanomagnetite grains as shown in high values of saturation magnetization and microscope observation (Fig.  4 I, J). In contrast, pyrite mineralization was observed in alteration halo and cracks in groundmass (Fig.  4 G, H). Measured grain density value is as large as fresh samples (6 K# 562 R 1 and 6 K# 569 R 4 - 2), indicating that alteration of primary minerals and formation of clay minerals did not occur considerably. Thermomagnetic curves demonstrate that both comparatively fresh and oxidized areas coexist within this sample (Fig.  5 d). The hysteresis measurements are consistent with these thermomagnetic results as only altered specimens show extremely low values of saturation magnetization and certain contribution of paramagnetic minerals (N[*]=[*] 2; Fig.  5 b, d). Heterogeneity within the sample was also identified in multi-specimen measurements of both NRM intensity and magnetic susceptibility (Fig.  4 A). These results indicate that hydrothermal processes are party promoted and dissolve titanomagnetite grains in groundmass into solution. Self-reversed chemical remanent magnetization, which is produced during extreme low-temperature oxidation (maghemitization) of titanomagnetite by ionic reordering (Doubrovine and Tarduno 2006 a), could be another cause of partly low values of NRM. However, it is indicated that very high oxidation states (z[*]>[*] 0.9) and relatively high Ti contents (x[*]>[*] 0.6) are needed to produce natural self-reversed components and that self-reversed magnetization (Doubrovine and Tarduno 2006 b). Although oxidation states were not verified in this study, presented low x values of observed titanomagnetite grains (0.26 for 6 K# 562 R 1 and 6 K# 569 R 4 - 1 samples and 0.06 for 6 K# 569 R 4 - 3 sample; Table  3) at least suggested that self-reversal might not occur in studied samples.|$|R
