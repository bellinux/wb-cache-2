(This {{is not the same as}} the <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> on investment (ROI), which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.) With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, balance of system (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of tropically-adapted Brahman stock revolutionized the beef cattle industry in northern Australia. It transformed struggling enterprises into efficient and profitable ones and contributed {{billions of dollars}} to domestic and export income. In 2000 a Meat and Livestock Australia project assessed the contribution to the Australian economy by Brahman genetics. Analysis of the <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> on investment for the Australian beef industry from 1970 to 2000 found that Brahman and Bos indicus infusion delivered an additional individual on-farm benefit of $9170 per annum. About 40,000 Australian cattle producers gained from this additional profit in each of those 30 years. Brahman and Brahman-infused cattle accounted for 90 per cent of the genetic improvement in the Australian industry. The cumulative on-farm return since 1970 from investment in Bos indicus genetics amounted to $10.2 billion of a total on-farm return to the national beef industry from all forms of technology of $11 billion. In 2013 ABBA comprises over 1200 members and is the largest beef cattle breed association, by membership, in Australia. Currently, a little over 50% of the Australian beef cattle herd has Brahman blood, while about 11 per cent of the herd is pure-bred. There are about 110,000 Brahman bulls above the Tropic of Capricorn, that is, about 70% of bulls in that region.|$|E

Unable to afford new stationery, he wrote on the verso side of old manuscripts. An outstanding warrant for assault and unpaid debts led to his being a fugitive in New York City for a while. Several people, including his brother James Mills Peirce and his neighbors, relatives of Gifford Pinchot, settled his debts and paid his property taxes and mortgage.|$|E

40|$|An {{irrigated}} {{agricultural landscape}} experiencing groundwater overdraft generates <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> and {{a suite of}} ecosystem services (in particular, groundwater supply, greenhouse gases reduction, and surface water quality). Alternative land cover choices indicate tradeoffs among the value of ecosystem services created and the <b>economic</b> <b>returns.</b> These tradeoffs are explored using efficiency frontiers that determine the least value in ecosystem services that must be given up to generate additional <b>economic</b> <b>returns.</b> Agricultural producers may switch to irrigation with surface water using on-farm reservoirs and tail water recovery systems in response to groundwater overdraft, and this has consequences for the bundle of ecosystem service values and <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> achievable from the landscape. Planning that accounts for both ecosystem service value and <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> can achieve more value for society, as does the adoption of reservoirs though lowering the costs of irrigation, increasing groundwater levels, and reducing fuel combustion and associated GHG emissions from groundwater pumping. Sensitivity analyses of per unit value of ecosystem services, crop prices, and the groundwater and water purification model parameters indicate tradeoff among ecosystems service values, {{such as the use}} of a high-end social cost of carbon ultimately lowers groundwater supply and water purification value by more than 15 %...|$|R

This increase has taken place although the <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> to schooling in Norway are low. The {{increase in the number of}} doctoral degrees has been particularly strong. This paper focuses on two issues. First, we estimate the <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> to a doctoral degree. Second, we provide some largely indirect evidence on how the (low or even negative) <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> have affected recruitment to doctoral studies. A data set consisting of nearly all graduates in five major educational fields from Norwegian universities from the early 1980 's until 1996 is used. Data are analysed by means of LAV regression (wage and income data) and logistic regression for discrete time event history data (attainment of doctoral degrees). There are negative income effects of doctoral degrees in medicine, mathematics and natural sciences, and engineering, and positive but not very strong effects in the humanities and the social sciences. There is no evidence that these different <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> have had important effects on recruitment patterns. There is, for instance, a strong positive effect of university grades in all five educational fields. Thus, the negative <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> in some fields do not seem to have had strong negative effects on the quality of the recruits...|$|R
