40|$|Introduction This {{graduation}} {{project has}} been initiated to research the technical feasibility of floating bridges. The {{project has been}} done in co-operation with the FDN engineering company and Delft technical university. A design is made of a continuous <b>pontoon</b> <b>floating</b> bridge, which connects a mainland to an island. Floating bridges can be constructed where conventional bridges are impractical (under the conditions that are described in section 1. 4. 2). The buoyancy forces support the bridge in the vertical direction and the mooring system in the horizontal direction. The project contains also a survey of the most known floating bridges in the world. Problem definition Which design limitations and structural parameters can ensure stability of the continuous <b>pontoon</b> <b>floating</b> bridge under wind and wave load? Research The objective of this thesis is to understand the response of the continuous <b>pontoon</b> <b>floating</b> bridges under wind-wave load and traffic load that is described in the euro code which enables us to optimize the structural design procedure. That can be accomplished by studying the influence of the pontoon dimensions and the pontoon connector rotational rigidity on the global stability of the bridge. Determination the principles of response reduction and converting the displacement into internal forces are a relevant part of this thesis as well as the mitigating of the local environmental loads to be redistributed along larger parts of the bridge. The scope of the graduation project is very wide. It contains an overview of floating bridges; its hydrodynamic behaviour will be defined and due to the limited period of time will be not analyzed. The hydrostatic behaviour and analysis of continuous <b>pontoon</b> <b>floating</b> bridges will be researched as a multi-body slender structure with flexible connections. Also the conceptual design of the pontoons and the connections and the shape effects were researched. Detailed design calculations for the case study are included in this thesis. Results Environmental loads are the main loading on the floating bridge. Because of the random form of the sea wave forces and the wind force, it is difficult to expect the precise value and direction of loading on the bridge. The environmental loads twist the bridge and excite it in the horizontal and in the vertical direction. When it is possible to construct a sliding pile mooring system to introduce the wind and wave load in the horizontal direction, the floating bridge will have a satisfactory stability. The efficiency of the mooring cable is lower than the sliding pile due to the relatively large compliance range. That is valid also for the vertical displacement; the bridge response will be introduced by the bridge flexural rigidity, the bridge mass, the water spring, the water damping and the pontoon connector stiffness when discrete pontoons are used. The linear theory is applied to determine the sea wave load. The hydro-static and the hydro-dynamic analysis of a multi-body slender structure consisting of rigidly or flexibly connected elements will be made [...] The design procedure of the mooring cables of the offshore structure is applied to design the mooring system. Conclusions and recommendations The connection stiffness of the pontoon has a large influence on the bridge response. The ratio connection stiffness over pontoon stiffness is very important for the bridge structural behaviour. When this ratio is smaller than 10 - 8 the bridge behaves as rigid bodies connected by hinges. When this ratio is larger than 10 - 3 the bridge behaves as a continuous elastic beam. The largest deflections, moments, and shear forces occur in the ends of the bridge. Additional supports, masses, or dampers at these ends can reduce these moments and forces strongly. Embedment steel crossheads are used to introduce the large mooring line forces without damaging the concrete walls of the pontoons. Further optimization of the pontoon length is recommended. Fatigue of the prestressing steel and the concrete are shown to be critical and need to be further investigated. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

They are used in <b>pontoon</b> bridges, <b>floating</b> piers, and floats anchored to the seabed for recreation or dockage.

50|$|Construction {{began on}} the new east-half <b>floating</b> <b>{{pontoons}}</b> at Concrete Technology in April 2006. Fourteen pontoons will be built in four cycles at the site. Completed <b>pontoons</b> will be <b>floated</b> out of the graving dock in Tacoma and transported to Seattle for outfitting at Todd Shipyards. Outfitting includes adding all electrical and mechanical parts, connecting the pontoons into sections and building the roadway {{on top of the}} pontoons.

40|$|For the {{assessment}} of extreme responses needed in design of marine structures, a full long-term analysis is recognized as the most accurate approach. However, due to the {{very large number of}} structural response analyses traditionally needed for this approach, the computational effort is usually considered to increase above acceptable levels for complex structures such as floating bridges. This paper shows that the first and second order reliability methods (FORM and SORM) found in connection with structural reliability analysis can be used in an inverse manner to efficiently obtain approximate solutions for the full long-term extreme response of structures subjected to environmental loads, and this is demonstrated for floating bridges. Very accurate results are obtained using a limited number of short-term response calculations, and by applying a fast calculation method for the short-term stochastic response, full long-term extreme responses are calculated for two different <b>pontoon</b> <b>floating</b> bridges...|$|R

50|$|Concrete {{floating}} bridges {{are employed}} to span the lake because Lake Washington's depth and muddy bottom prevented the emplacement of the pilings or towers {{necessary for the}} construction of a causeway or suspension bridge. The bridges consist of hollow concrete <b>pontoons</b> that <b>float</b> atop the lake, anchored with cables to each other and to weights on the lake bottom. The roadway is constructed atop these concrete <b>pontoons.</b> Three <b>floating</b> bridges cross Lake Washington: the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge (officially the SR 520 Albert D. Rosellini Evergreen Point Floating Bridge) carries State Route 520 from Seattle's Montlake neighborhood to Medina while the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge and the Third Lake Washington Bridge (officially the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge) carry Interstate 90 from Seattle's Mount Baker neighborhood to Mercer Island. The East Channel Bridge carries Interstate 90 from Mercer Island to Bellevue. The Evergreen Point, Lacey V. Murrow, and Third Lake Washington bridges are the longest, second longest, and fifth longest floating bridges in the world, respectively.|$|R

The crane was completed in 1915 and originally was known as the Grosser Schwimmkran, but was christened Langer Heinrich. The crane was built by Demag in Duisburg and the <b>float</b> <b>pontoon</b> for the crane was built by AG Weser. The crane needed to lift ship towers, ship components or sometimes ship hulls. She help assemble the German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee and German battleship Tirpitz. The <b>pontoon</b> <b>float</b> is 50.42 m by 30.92 m with a depth draft of 3.05 m. The crane displaced 3,898 tons and was driven by two triple expansion steam engines with 1,000 HP each. The crane had three smaller hoist for lifting 10, 20 and 50 tons. The main hoist is two 125 tonnes cranes. The two 125 ton lifting units could be coupled for a combined lift of 250 tonnes. The crane had a maximum jib tower height of 81.4 m. The crane is self-propelled with two propellers and <b>floats</b> on <b>pontoons.</b> The pontoon has 41 compartments, some of these can be flooded for counterbalance of the object lifted. The superstructure can be rotated 360 degrees. The crane has a deadweight of 2,393 tons. So noted was the crane, she was pictured on some German bank notes, Deutsche Marks.|$|R
