5|$|The Liberal-Courtier coalition's cabinet, formed upon PedroII's {{assumption}} of <b>full</b> <b>powers,</b> convoked national elections for {{seats in the}} legislature convene in 1842. The voting was accompanied by so much violence and fraud that it became known as Elections of the club (or Elections of the truncheon). For Honório Hermeto, this meant {{the loss of his}} seat as general deputy after his bid for reelection failed. The Liberal-Courtier cabinet did not survive long, however, and its ministers presented their resignations in turn. On 23 March 1841, a new cabinet was nominated that included Aureliano Coutinho from the Courtier Faction and other ministers drawn from the Reactionary Party.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} settlement, Augustus was also granted {{the power of}} a tribune (tribunicia potestas) for life, though not the {{official}} title of tribune. For some years, Augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas, the immunity given to a Tribune of the Plebs. Now he decided to assume the <b>full</b> <b>powers</b> of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to patricians, a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar. This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting. Also included in Augustus' tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the Roman censor; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Grant was {{vigorous}} in his {{enforcement of}} the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. He proactively used military and Justice Department enforcement of civil rights laws {{and the protection of}} African Americans more than any other 19th century president. He used his <b>full</b> <b>powers</b> to weaken the Ku Klux Klan, reducing violence and intimidation in the South. He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation. Grant's relationship with Charles Sumner, the leader in promoting civil rights, was shattered by the Senator's opposition to Grant's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty. Grant retaliated, firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant's reelection.|$|E
5|$|In the reconvened Parliament, Fox and Pitt wrangled {{over the}} terms of a regency during the King's incapacity. While both agreed that it would be most {{reasonable}} for George III's eldest son and heir apparent, the Prince of Wales, to act as regent, to Pitt’s consternation Fox suggested that it was the Prince of Wales's absolute right to act on his ill father's behalf with <b>full</b> <b>powers.</b> Pitt, fearing he would be removed from office if the Prince of Wales were empowered, argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a regent, and wanted to restrict the regent's authority. In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Parallel {{operation}} {{is an effective}} way to improve the capacity of <b>full</b> <b>power</b> converter in permanent-magnet directdrive (PMDD) wind power generation system. But it causes the zero-sequence circulating-current (ZSCC), which brings current discrepancy, current waveform distortion, power losses, and electromagnetic interference (EMI), etc. The paper proposes a new topology of <b>full</b> <b>power</b> converters which are composed of n <b>full</b> <b>power</b> converters. The n converters have the same structures and are in parallel with each other. Besides, the average models of the system are analyzed and the fundamental mechanism of ZSCC generation is given. Based on the above analysis, the control strategy of the system is designed. The simulation and experiment results of two parallel <b>full</b> <b>power</b> converters show the feasibility of the proposed theory and control scheme.

5|$|Manuel is {{mentioned}} {{for the first}} time in 978, when he led the defence of Nicaea against the rebel general Bardas Skleros, who had risen up against Emperor Basil II (reigned 976–1025). Although his great-granddaughter, the princess Anna Komnene, claims in her Alexiad that he had been named strategos autokrator (commander-in-chief) of the East and sent with <b>full</b> <b>powers</b> to deal with the revolt, it is far more likely that he was merely a local commander. Manuel maintained the city's defence with some success, even though the besiegers managed to undermine and collapse one of its towers, until the lack of food became acute. At that point Manuel was able to fool Skleros, by pretending that he had mountains of wheat and was considering joining him, into allowing him and the inhabitants to depart freely for Constantinople. Manuel re-appears in 989, when he was sent as an envoy to Skleros, who had once more risen in revolt against Basil II, to persuade him to surrender. Manuel was successful in his task, and the elderly rebel ended his revolt and gave himself up on 11 October. The titles by which he is recorded were patrikios, anthypatos, and vestes.|$|E

While compared to the full repowering concept, this repowering scheme achieves slightly lower efficiency. Due to the two independent steam sources for the steam turbine, this concept provides a higher fuel flexibility and also greater flexibility in respect to load variations.|$|R
