5|$|The first {{silkworm}} diseases {{began to}} appear in 1845, creating an epidemic. Among them are pébrine, caused by the microsporidia Nosema bombycis, grasserie, caused by a virus, <b>flacherie,</b> caused by eating infected mulberry leaves or white muscardine disease, caused by the fungus Beauveria bassiana. The epidemic grew to a massive scale, and after having attacked the silkworms, other viruses began to infect the mulberry trees. The chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas, French minister of agriculture, was charged with stopping the epidemic. In face of sericulturers' call for help, he asked Louis Pasteur to study the disease, starting in 1865. For many years, Pasteur thought that pébrine was not a contagious disease. In 1870 he changed his view, and measures were enacted that caused the disease to decline.|$|E
25|$|Silkworms with pébrine {{were covered}} in corpuscles. In the first three years, Pasteur thought that the corpuscles were {{a symptom of the}} disease. In 1870, he {{concluded}} that the corpuscles were the cause of pébrine (it is now known that the cause is a microsporidian). Pasteur also showed that the disease was hereditary. Pasteur developed a system to prevent pébrine: after the female moths laid their eggs, the moths were turned into a pulp. The pulp was examined with a microscope, and if corpuscles were observed, the eggs were destroyed. Pasteur concluded that bacteria caused <b>flacherie.</b> The primary cause is currently thought to be viruses. The spread of <b>flacherie</b> could be accidental or hereditary. Hygiene could be used to prevent accidental <b>flacherie.</b> Moths whose digestive cavities did not contain the microorganisms causing <b>flacherie</b> were used to lay eggs, preventing hereditary <b>flacherie.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Agostino Bassi {{had shown that}} {{muscardine}} {{was caused by a}} fungus that infected silkworms. Since 1853, two diseases called pébrine and <b>flacherie</b> had been infecting great numbers of silkworms in southern France, and by 1865 they were causing huge losses to farmers. In 1865, Pasteur went to Alès and worked for five years until 1870.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the family}} dicistroviruses are to {{beneficial}} invertebrates such as honey bees and shrimp and to insect pests of medical and agricultural importance that share features with animal and human viruses {{of the family}}. Picornaviridae and other insect or marine viruses of the order Picornavirales. Its genome is linear, single stranded positive sense RNA with a viral genome-linked protein (VPg) covalently linked at the 5’ end and a 3’ poly (A) tract as picornaviruses. Plautia stali intestine virus kelp fly virus, Ectropis obliqua picorna-like virus, deformed wing virus, acute bee paralysis virus, Drosophila C virus, Rhopalosiphum padi virus, and Himetobi P virus. Several {{have been placed in}} a separate family—the Dicistroviridae. Others have been placed into a new family Iflaviridae. This family includes Infectious <b>flacherie</b> virus and SeIV-1 virus. Another virus is Nora virus from Drosophila melanogaster. This latter virus awaits further classification.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flacherie</b> (literally: [...] "flaccidness") is {{a disease}} of {{silkworms}}, caused by silkworms eating infected or contaminated mulberry leaves. <b>Flacherie</b> infected silkworms look weak and can die from this disease. Silkworm larvae that are about to die from <b>Flacherie</b> are a dark brown.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of flacherie: essentially, {{infectious}} (viral) <b>flacherie</b> and noninfectious (bouffee) <b>flacherie.</b> Both are technically a lethal diarrhea.|$|E

50|$|Viral <b>flacherie</b> is {{ultimately}} caused by infection with Bombyx mori infectious <b>flacherie</b> virus (BmIFV, Iflaviridae), Bombyx mori densovirus (BmDNV, Parvoviridae) or Bombyx mori cypovirus 1 (BmCPV-1, Reoviridae). This either {{alone or in}} combination with bacterial infection destroys the gut tissue. Bacterial pathogens contributing to infectious flaccherie are Serratia marcescens, and species of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus in the form known as thatte roga.|$|E

5000|$|Iflaviridae is {{a family}} of {{positive}} sense RNA viruses insect-infecting viruses. Some of the insects commonly infected by iflaviruses include aphids, leafhoppers, flies, bees, ants, silkworms and wasps.

5000|$|Pasteur did his {{research}} on the silkworm disease (pébrine and <b>flacherie)</b> at Alès, and the town dedicated a bust to his memory. There is also a statue of the chemist J.B. Dumas. Alphonse Daudet was master study at the College of Ales and was written [...] "le petit chose".|$|E
5000|$|Louis Pasteur, {{who began}} his studies on {{silkworm}} diseases in 1865, {{was the first one}} able to recognize that mortality due to viral <b>flacherie</b> was caused by infection. (Priority, however, was claimed by Antoine Béchamp.) Richard Gordon described the discovery: [...] "The French silk industry was meanwhile plummeting from a 130 million to an 8 million francs annual income, because the silkworms had all caught pébrine, black pepper disease…He Pasteur went south from Paris to Alais, and rewarded them by discovering the silkworm epidemic to be inflicted by some sort of living microbe…Pasteur threw in another disease, <b>flâcherie,</b> silkworm diarrhoea. The cures for both were culling the insects which showed the peppery spots [...] - [...] the peasants bottled the silkworm moths in brandy, for display to the experts [...] - [...] and rigorous hygiene of the mulberry leaf." ...|$|E

40|$|Total haemocyte count, {{differential}} haemocyte count, {{changes in}} nucleus/nucleolar ratios of various haemocytes, {{as well as}} haemolymph protein and reducing sugar of fifth instar larvae of Bombyx mori L. inoculated with <b>flacherie</b> were studied. The inoculated worms received 250300 spores/ml {{on the third day}} of fifth instar. The infected larvae showed 15. 3 % decrease in total haemocyte count (THC) when compared to healthy worms. Prohaemocytes and granular haemocytes, which form the bulk of the total population, were not influenced by Bacillus thurungienses, where as significant increase was observed in differential haemocyte count (DHC) of plasmocytes alone. Bacterial infection also influenced nucleus/nucleolar (N/Nu) ratio of plasmocytes and oenocytoids indicating their role in larval immunity process. Plasma protein and reducing sugars were marginally reduced on infection. The above results were discussed in the light of pathophysiology of silkworm on bacterial infection...|$|E
40|$|Iflaviruses are insect {{viruses that}} form non-enveloped, {{icosahedral}} particles approximately 30 nm in diameter. The particles contain one {{copy of the}} single-stranded RNA genome, which has a positive polarity. The genome encodes one large polyprotein, which is post-translationally processed. The viral coat proteins are located in an N-terminal domain of the polyprotein, while the non-structural proteins, involved in replication and polyprotein processing, {{are present in the}} C-terminal region. The order of the individual proteins in the polyprotein is strictly conserved. Polyprotein translation may initiate at an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5 ' untranslated region (UTR) of the RNA. The 3 ' UTR is followed by a poly(A) tail. Based on genome organization, virion structure and phylogeny, iflaviruses form a distinct group in the order Picornavirales, justifying their classification in a virus family separate from for instance Dicistroviridae and Picornaviridae. The type species of the family Iflaviridae, genus Iflavirus, is infectious <b>flacherie</b> virus (IFV) of silkworms...|$|E
40|$|The Bombyx mori parvo-like virus (China Zhenjiang isolate), termed as BmDNV-Z, {{replicates}} only in host’s midgut columnar {{cells and}} causes <b>flacherie</b> disease. The viral genome {{is composed of}} two sets of different single-stranded linear DNA molecules, Viral DNA 1 (VD 1) and Viral DNA 2 (VD 2). Here we cloned the major VP gene from the plasmid contained viral DNA fragments. The gene consists of 1500 nucleotides and the deduced protein has 499 amino acid residues, with the predicted molecular weight of 54934. 24 Da, isoelectric point of 6. 73. The coding sequence was inserted into expression plasmid vector pET- 30 a and expressed in Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3) under the inducible promoter LacZ. The expressed product was detected by Western blotting with anti-His antibody. Interestingly, there are four laddered band instead of one. We speculated that this virus may use leaky scanning mechanism to express four proteins in one ORF. And we investigated the major VP gene transcriptional time phase in susceptible silkworm through real time quantitative PCR (qPCR). The result showed that the mRNA level of VP gene increased greatly after 24 hours post inoculation...|$|E
40|$|Enterococcus mundtii {{was shown}} to be {{directly}} correlated with <b>flacherie</b> disease of the silkworm larvae reared on artificial diet supplemented with chloramphenicol. Its identification {{was carried out by}} means of light and electron microscopy and nucleotide sequencing of 16 S gene. The bacterium is capable of rapidly multiplying in the silkworm gut and of invading other body tissues, as demonstrated by deliberate infection of germfree larvae and by subsequent TEM observations. E. mundtii can endure alkaline pH of the silkworm gut and it has been proved to adapt in vitro to commonly applied doses of chloramphenicol, whose use can further contribute to reduce competition by other bacteria in Bombyx mori alimentary canal. The modality of transmission of the infection to the larvae was among the objectives of the present research. Since contamination of the progeny by mother moths can be avoided through routine egg shell disinfection, a trans-ovarian vertical transmission can be ruled out. On the other hand the bacterium was for the first time identified on mulberry leaves, and therefore artificial diet based on leaf powder could be a source of infection. We showed that while microwaved diet could contain live E. mundtii cells, the autoclaved diet is safe in this respect. Being E. mundtii also part of the human-associated microbiota, and since B. mori is totally domestic species, a possible role of man in its epidemiology can be postulated...|$|E
