5|$|At Will Bloom’s wedding party, {{his father}} Edward recalls the day Will was born, {{claiming}} he caught an enormous catfish using his wedding ring as bait. Will, having heard these stories all his life, believes {{them to be}} lies and falls out with his father. Three years later, Edward is stricken with cancer, so Will and his pregnant French wife Joséphine return to his childhood home in Alabama {{to spend time with}} his father. Edward’s life is told through flashbacks, beginning with his encounter with a witch in his hometown, Ashton. She shows him his death but he reacts to it without <b>fear.</b> <b>As</b> he grows into adulthood, he finds his home too confining, and sets out into the world with a misunderstood giant, Karl, who has come to town with a traveling circus.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British forces {{landed on}} the island and told the keeper's wife, Thankful Stone, that they had nothing to <b>fear</b> <b>as</b> long as they kept the light burning. Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} to blow up the lighthouse, and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is a flash of white light every ten seconds. It continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Jo {{is furious}} to {{discover}} that all the chickens have been slaughtered. Blaming a local fox, she lays traps for the animal and goes after it with a rifle, assisted by Jessica and Kator. When the hunt fails, Kator tracks and kills the fox {{on his own and}} presents it to Jessica and Jo as a trophy. The trio celebrate with a champagne party for which Jo dresses Kator in drag. A subsequent game of hide-and-seek brings out more of the hunter in Kator. Later, Jo is disturbed to find the fox carcass stripped bare and realises that the animal was not caught in a trap as she and Jessica thought. Jessica angrily rejects her warnings about Anders, interpreting Jo's <b>fear</b> <b>as</b> jealousy and revealing that she knows the truth about Simon.|$|E

25|$|The {{division}} in the Waverley family had been caused by the English Civil War of the mid-seventeenth century. Fear of civil war is ever-present in Waverley not just as subject matter or historical reality, but a primal <b>fear</b> <b>as</b> deep in Scott as in Shakespeare as manifested by various allusions throughout the novel and by direct references to Henry V and Henry VI in chapter 71.|$|E
25|$|Bauer cites this <b>fear</b> <b>as</b> {{evidence}} that the Hungarian-Jewish community {{was well aware of}} the information about the gas chambers inside Auschwitz. Between August 1943 and May 1944, Rudolf Vrba and three other Auschwitz escapees had passed information about the gas chambers to Jewish and other officials; it was this information that Vrba believed Kastner had access to but did not distribute widely enough.|$|E

25|$|Reviewers {{have pointed}} out that the show {{effectively}} utilizes a number of cinematic techniques common in horror film. The editing leaves open the question of whether paranormal activity is actually occurring, and the cinematography uses night-vision and infrared photography to create a suspenseful atmosphere. The writing on the show is particularly effective at creating a sense of portent and dread, one reviewer noted, and the music and graphics contribute effectively to the tension and <b>fear</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|E
25|$|The various {{attacks in}} May, {{following}} Stillman's Run helped {{contribute to the}} region's growing <b>fear</b> <b>as</b> well as an exodus from the area near the incidents. In {{the case of the}} attack that killed Henry Apple, the result was a battle which helped sway the course of the militia's morale and public confidence in the force. The attack at Ament's Cabin led to a small chase of the attackers but nothing came of it and the remains of Elijah Phillips were returned to Hennepin, Illinois for burial.|$|E

So God {{delivered}} King Og of Bashan, his men, and his 60 towns into the Israelites' hands, and they left no survivor.

25|$|Often {{there is}} a {{noticeable}} difference between the perceived risk of becoming a victim of crime and the statistical probability. However, hearing about events in the media or knowing others who have been victimised increases public perception {{of the risk of}} victimisation. In some western countries, crime accounts for up to 25% of news coverage. The formation of a ‘fear of crime' feedback loop allows more citizens to be surveyed as fearful, more politicians {{to be able to use}} crime <b>fear</b> <b>as</b> a political issue, in an ever increasing spiral that crime is out of control.|$|E
25|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second Liberian Civil War in 1999, Yeaten further rose in prominence, and he was appointed lieutenant general, becoming both the most senior general as well as deputy commander of the armed forces. By early 2000, Yeaten had also triumphed in his rivalry with Chuckie, who had proven to be completely incapable as ATU commander. As result, President Taylor made Yeaten the de facto leader of the ATU, filling its ranks with Yeaten's followers. In the following two years, however, the civil war turned against the president who responded by putting Yeaten effectively in charge of the whole war effort. While he was considered a capable commander, who inspired both <b>fear</b> <b>as</b> well as respect among his troops, Yeaten could not stop the collapse of Taylor's regime. A major and successful government counter-offensive in northern Liberia that recaptured Tubmanburg proved inconsequential, while the rebels were gaining strength.|$|E

25|$|When Bane brings Emperor Blackgate to the Penguin, the Penguin {{tells him}} that the Arkham fighters are not scared of Bane, as he does not instill <b>fear</b> <b>as</b> Batman did. Realizing this, Bane {{constructs}} a Batsuit for himself and heads to Wayne Tower to confront Killer Croc. Bane fights Killer Croc {{and is able to}} defeat him, setting his sights on retrieving the Talons. Bane wakes up the Talon William Cobb and takes him through Gotham where he fights various inmates of Arkham Asylum. Bane begins recruiting Gotham citizens to his side, offering his base at Wayne Tower as a haven to the people to escape the rule of the Arkham inmates. He tells Cobb his plan to turn the city over to the Court, in exchange for use of Talons at his disposal to be powered by his Venom. The Talons attack Bane's men, and eventually set their target on Bane. With Cobb's help, Bane is able to injure the Talons enough to activate their regenerative powers to remove the mind-control technology.|$|E
