However, WADEM focuses more on <b>disaster</b> <b>medicine</b> than emergency medicine system development, {{and many of its}} member physicians are not specialists in emergency medicine. Additionally, the European Society for Emergency Medicine (EuSEM) has hosted an annual conference since 1998. EuSEM also publishes The European Journal of Emergency Medicine, develops recommendations for emergency medicine standards for European countries, and supports a <b>disaster</b> <b>medicine</b> training center and degree program in San Marino. The Asian Society for Emergency Medicine (Asian Society), which was founded in 1998, holds its own biennial conference. In addition to that, the Asian Society, like the EuSEM, develops curriculum recommendations for Asian countries.|$|E

50|$|<b>Disaster</b> <b>medicine</b> {{is unique}} among the medical {{specialties}} in that unlike all {{other areas of}} specialization, the <b>disaster</b> <b>medicine</b> specialist does not practice the full scope of the specialty everyday but only in emergencies. Indeed, the <b>disaster</b> <b>medicine</b> specialist hopes to never practice the full scope of skills required for board certification. However, like specialists in public health, environmental medicine and occupational medicine, <b>disaster</b> <b>medicine</b> specialists engage {{in the development and}} modification of public and private policy, legislation, disaster planning and disaster recovery. Within the United States of America, the specialty of <b>disaster</b> <b>medicine</b> fulfils the requirements set for by Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD), the National Response Plan (NRP), the National Incident Management System (NIMS), the National Resource Typing System (NRTS) and the NIMS Implementation Plan for Hospitals and Healthcare Facilities.|$|E

On October 18, 2007 the American Academy of <b>Disaster</b> <b>Medicine</b> was also the first medical organization in history to fulfill a Presidential mandate (Homeland Security Presidential Directive 21) that called for the formal organization of disaster healthcare. AADM was instrumental in establishing <b>disaster</b> <b>medicine</b> as a recognized medical specialty; a certifying board, the American Board of <b>Disaster</b> <b>Medicine</b> was approved by the American Board of Physician Specialties in 2004.

The final paper's output is a demand for the necessary health care differentiation in the sense to define the immediate care as one of the basic types of health care divided in the pre-hospital and the in-hospital phases in consequence of a new disaster category - the man conceived disasters. Beyoun dispute, the problem of terrorism belongs to them, included the real threat of using the weapons of mass destruction, the so-called CRBNE phenomenon. In such situation, there significantly arises the need for an integrated rescue system and for differential health care with full and coordinated utilization of professional capacities of the state health service system, consequently -according to the character of the evocating cause - towards the aim of maximal efficiency.

40|$|Sentiment {{analysis}} {{is one of}} the fastest growing research areas in computer science, making it challenging to keep track of all the activities in the area. We present a computer-assisted literature review, where we utilize both text mining and qualitative coding, and analyze 6, 996 papers from Scopus. We find that the roots of sentiment analysis are in the studies on public opinion analysis at the beginning of 20 th century and in the text subjectivity analysis performed by the computational linguistics community in 1990 's. However, the outbreak of computer-based sentiment analysis only occurred with the availability of subjective texts on the Web. Consequently, 99 % of the papers have been published after 2004. Sentiment analysis papers are scattered to multiple publication venues, and the combined number of papers in the top- 15 venues only represent ca. 30 % of the papers in total. We present the top- 20 cited papers from Google Scholar and Scopus and a taxonomy of research topics. In recent years, sentiment analysis has shifted from analyzing online product reviews to social media texts from Twitter and Facebook. Many topics beyond product reviews like stock markets, elections, <b>disasters,</b> <b>medicine,</b> software engineering and cyberbullying extend the utilization of sentiment analysisComment: 29 pages, 14 figure...|$|R
