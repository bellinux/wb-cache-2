40|$|AbstractThe drying of saffron stigma was {{investigated}} in a laboratory <b>infrared</b> <b>dryer.</b> The effect of temperature on the drying rate of samples at various temperatures (60, 70 … 110  °C) was studied. The drying time decreased {{with an increase in}} drying air temperature. The constant-rate period is absent from the drying curve. The drying of saffron occurred in the falling rate period. Four, thin-layer drying models, namely, Lewis, Handerson and Pabis, Page, and Midilli and Kucuk, were fitted to drying data. The performance of these models {{was investigated}} by comparing the determination of coefficient (R 2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the observed and predicted moisture ratios. Among these models, in each of six drying temperatures, the Midilli and Kucuk model gave the best results and showed good agreement with the experimental data obtained from the experiments, including the thin layer drying process. In all drying temperatures, the amounts of R 2 were higher than 0. 999, and the amounts of RMSE were less than 0. 012. According to results, {{it can be said that}} the Midilli and Kucuk model adequately described the drying behavior of saffron stigmas at a controlled temperature range 60 – 110  °C in an <b>infrared</b> <b>dryer...</b>|$|E

The results revealed large differences in molecular structure, i. e., cross-linking and hydrolysis, between films and coatings. The main differences were due to the shorter drying time allowed to laboratory-scale coatings and the accelerated drying process in pilot trials owing to the high energy output of <b>infrared</b> <b>dryers.</b> Furthermore, surface morphology was highly affected by the coating technique used, with a rougher surface and many pinholes occurring in pilot-scale coatings, giving lower water vapor permeability than laboratory-scale coatings...|$|R

40|$|<b>Infrared</b> (IR) <b>dryers</b> {{are widely}} used in the paper industry, mainly in the {{production}} of coated paper grades. The thesis deals with various aspects of heat transfer and energy use in <b>infrared</b> heaters and <b>dryers</b> as employed in the paper industry. Both gas-fired and electric IR dryers are considered and compared. The thesis also provides an introduction to infrared heaters and infrared drying, including a review of recent literature in the field. The transport of thermal radiation inside a paper sheet was investigated and different IR dryers were compared in terms of their ability to transfer energy to the internal parts of a paper sheet. Although there were evident differences in the absorption of radiation between gas-fired and electric IR dryers, the distinction was found to not be as important as has generally been believed. The main differences appeared to be due to the choice of a one- or a two-sided dryer solution, rather than the spectral distributions emitted by the dryers. A method for evaluating the radiation efficiency of IR heaters was proposed. An electric IR heater was evaluated in the laboratory. The radiation efficiency of the heater was shown to be strongly dependent on the power level. The maximum efficiency, found at high power level, was close to 60 %. A procedure for evaluation of the total energy transfer efficiency of an <b>infrared</b> paper <b>dryer</b> was proposed and used in the evaluation of an electric IR dryer operating in an industrial coating machine. The efficiency of the dryer was roughly 40 %. A model for an electric IR heater was developed. The model includes non-grey radiative heat transfer between the different parts of the heater, as well as conduction in reflector material and convective cooling of the surfaces. Using IR module voltage as the only input, model predictions of temperatures and heat flux were found to agree well with experimental data both at steady state and under transient conditions. The model was also extended to include features typical of an industrial IR dryer and was used to predict trends in IR dryer efficiency in relation to changes in power level and in paper grade...|$|R

This work focuses on improving the arrangement and asynchrony of SPBCS components {{rather than the}} design of the predictor and the feedback controller, which have been well discussed in the literature. The proposed control system advances SPBCS through implementation of two design recommendations: (i) replacing the classical feedback controller by a feedback-feedforward control system, and (ii) synchronizing the reference signal and the predicted output. As a result, common shortcomings of SPBCSs or control systems based on Pade approximation, i. e. the trade-off between performance and steady-state error, and instability associated with non-minimum-phase systems do not exist in the proposed SPBCS. The superior performance of the proposed control system is demonstrated with two examples: temperature control of an <b>infrared</b> <b>dryer</b> (a system with fixed time-delay) and air-fuel ratio of a lean-burn spark-ignition engine (a system with time-varying delay and lag).

Effective diffusion coefficient of moisture transfer was determined using the Fick law at three drying temperatures (40, 50, and 60 °C). Shrinkage was also included into the diffusion model for {{the determination of the}} effective diffusion coefficient. The obtained results of the effective moisture diffusivity, for the cladode and the fruit, were evaluated in the range of 1. 77 × 10 − 10 – 5. 07 × 10 − 10 [*]m 2 /s and 2. 53 × 10 − 10 – 7. 6 × 10 − 10 [*]m 2 /s, respectively. The values of the activation energies for cladode and fruit were estimated to be 45. 39 and 47. 79 [*]kJ/mol, respectively. However, these values of moisture diffusivity were estimated independently of the evolution of moisture content during drying process. Therefore, a correlation (full quadratic equation) for moisture diffusivity as a function of moisture content and temperature was developed.

Four temperatures (50, 60, 70, and 80 °C) and three air velocity levels (0. 4, 0. 6, and 0. 8 m/s) were employed as the drying factors. Results: The drying rate increased with the increase in the temperature and air velocity but decreased with time. However, the drying rate was influenced by temperature rather than velocity. At a temperature 50 °C with a air velocity of 0. 4 m/s, it took 350 min for the radish to dry which was the longest drying time; 80 °C with a air velocity of 0. 8 m/s, it took 180 min for the radish to dry, which was the shortest drying time. △E (the color difference value) increased with the increase in temperature and air velocity. The browning and rehydration ratio increased as the temperature rose. Energy consumption decreased with the increased temperature and air velocity. Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, the best drying conditions for the radish were determined to be a temperature of 70 °C with an air velocity of 0. 8 m/s...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{a hybrid}} feedforward-feedback control system is {{proposed}} {{and used to}} control the temperature of an <b>infrared</b> batch <b>dryer.</b> Initially, the concept of control equilibrium point is introduced for control system which is {{the point that the}} control error and all its derivatives equal zero. The control command at this point is called “steady state control command”. Originally, this method requires the mathematical model of the system; however, a static artificial neural network (ANN) was designed and trained {{to play the role of}} feedforward control law. With a simple P-action feedback controller, the stability of the system is proved with no limit on the value of the controller gain. It means that the controller gain can be arbitrarily high without harming the stability and the temperature can converge towards the reference value as quick as possible (considering actuators’ limit). The actuator is a halogen lamp in this research. In practice, there is a dead-time of 1. 3 s in this system which prevents the proposed hybrid control system to work perfectly. A predictive approach is employed to solve this problem. A dynamic neural network is designed to simulate the behaviour of the dryer. The sampling time is 0. 1 s, so 13 consequent ANNs are employed for the purpose of predictive control. This predictive system predicts the temperature of the dryer 1. 3 s in advance, so the dead-time is compensated and the stability proof remains valid. The merit of the proposed hybrid control method is verified experimentally. Morteza Mohammadzaheri, Ali Mirsepahi, Mehdi Ghanbari, Lei Chen[URL]...|$|R

After estimating the order, the appropriate sampling time and the dead-time which will be explained in detail in full paper. The recorded data are arranged for system identification purposes. Then, an artificial neural network (ANN) is designed for the furnace system and trained. In conclusion, the obtained results, after checking the trained neural network, show that the methodology of ANN is applicable to predict the behaviour of the batch drying process for several minutes very accurately. Moreover, in comparison with classical heat transfer modeling approaches, the proposed method does not require any knowledge about the mechanical properties of the system like conduction or emissivity coefficients which are usually inaccurate and subject to change. Furthermore, after off-line training process, the designed ANN model can predict the temperature much faster than classical heat transfer methods due to much less required computation.
