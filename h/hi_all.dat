40|$|We {{present a}} new {{analysis}} of an absorption {{system in the}} spectrum of Q 0014 + 813, with particular attention to a single cold cloud at redshift z= 2. 797957. Features are identified at this redshift corresponding to SiIII, SiIV, CIV, DI, and <b>HI,</b> <b>all</b> consistent with purely thermal broadening at T≈ 19, 000 K. The deuterium identification is confirmed by its narrow width and precise agreement with the silicon and carbon redshifts. The HI column is well constrained by a slightly damped profile in the blue wing of Lyα, and the DI column by its saturation, leading to a 95 % confidence lower limit (D/H) > 0. 7 × 10 ^- 4. The abundance is measured from line fits to be (D/H) = 1. 9 _- 0. 9 ^+ 1. 6 × 10 ^- 4, {{in agreement with the}} high deuterium abundance previously found in the z= 3. 32 system in the same quasar spectrum.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the morpho-physiological characteristics of chickpea associated with drought tolerance {{based on a}} study of selected chickpea lines under field conditions in Nakuru and Baringo counties in Kenya. Drought has been spreading to more land in Kenya over the years due to climatic change attributed to global warming. Chickpea being drought resistant {{can act as a}} cereal-legume relay crop in dry highlands during the short rains as it improves soil fertility and conserves moisture. But currently there are no lines released for commercial production in Kenya, hence there is need to introduce and evaluate several lines to identify those that can do well in dry lands of Kenya. This study therefore screened several chickpea genotypes to identify and select drought tolerant lines with associated morpho-physiological characteristics under field conditions and determined their heritability. The study was conducted in two sites, at Koibatek-Farmers Training Centre for two seasons (during the short and long rains) and in KEPHIS-Lanet for one season (long rains). A mini core collection of 30 lines from ICRISAT was evaluated in the two sites in a Randomised Complete Block Design (RCBD), replicated twice.

These data are not available for the rest of The Netherlands. Results: between 1984 and 1993, 1707 cases of EAS were reported to the Public Prosecutor in North Holland. The average age of the female patients to whom EAS was administered was 65 years; for men the average age was 62. For both men and women EAS was most frequently performed in the age-categories of 60 - 69 years and 70 - 79 years.

Patients and methods:One hundred and ninety patients with 329 carotid plaques producing 50 – 99 % stenosis were studied. Carotid plaque echogenicity on ultrasonography was evaluated using computerised measurement of the median of the overall grey scale content (GSM). Heterogeneity was evaluated as the difference between the GSMs of the most echogenic and the most echolucent areas within each plaque and expressed as the heterogeneity index (<b>HI).</b> <b>All</b> patients had a CT brain scan and the presence of ipsilateral cerebral infarction noted. Results:Cerebral infarction was more common in symptomatic than asymptomatic plaques (42 % vs. 29 %, p < 0. 02) and in echolucent than echogenic plaques (mean GSM of 37. 8 vs. 29. 7, p < 0. 01). Plaques with GSM below or equal to 32 were associated with a higher incidence of cerebral infarction as compared to those above this level, this was significant in both symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques. Symptomatic carotid plaque were less heterogenous than asymptomatic plaques. Plaques associated with cerebral infarction were less heterogenous than those not associated with infarction. Conclusion:This study has shown that the identification of the high risk carotid plaques, i. e. those associated with a high incidence of cerebral infarction is possible both in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The potential of such analysis in the identification of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis with high and low risk of stroke should be explored in a natural history study...|$|E
40|$|Neuronal {{injury is}} a key feature of {{neonatal}} hypoxicischemic (HI) brain injury. However, the mechanisms underpinning neuronal losses, {{such as in the}} brainstem, are poorly understood. One possibility is that disrupted neural connections between the cortex and brainstem may compromise the survival of neuronal cell bodies in the brainstem. We investigated whether brainstem raphe serotonergic neurons that project to the cortex are lost after HI. We also tested if neuroinflammation has a role in disrupting brainstem raphe projections. Postnatal day 3 (P 3) rats underwent unilateral carotid artery ligation followed by hypoxia (6 % oxygen for 30 min). A retrograde tracer, choleratoxin b, was deposited in the motor cortex on P 38. On P 45 we found that retrogradely labelled neurons in the dorsal raphe dorsal, ventrolateral, interfascicular, caudal and ventral nuclei were lost after P 3 <b>HI.</b> <b>All</b> retrogradely labelled neurons in the raphe nuclei were serotonergic. Numbers of retrogradely labelled neurons were also reduced in the ventromedial thalamus and basolateral amygdala.

These results indicate that raphe neurons projecting to the cortex constitute a population of serotonergic neurons that are lost after P 3 HI. Furthermore, neuroinflammation has a role in the disruption of raphe and thalamic neural projections.

The neutral hydrogen is much better tracer of the underlying mass distribution compared to the luminous matter and can be used to test the existence of a population of small galaxies in which the star formation has been partially or completely suppressed during cosmic evolution. Due to technical limitations, the existing HI surveys are not very sensitive to HI masses below 10 ^ 8 M_sun. We designed a blind HI survey to be sensitive to objects with small HI masses. The surveyed area is in the Canis Venatici groups of galaxies and covers in total ~ 86 deg^ 2 of sky, with observed velocities in the range - 350 < cz < 1400 km/s. We detected 69 objects, 22 of {{them for the first time}} in <b>HI.</b> <b>All</b> new HI detections fall in the lower part of the mass-histogram, confirming our ability to detect galaxies with small HI masses.

40|$|The {{amino acid}} {{composition}} of globular proteins of known tertiary structures is analyzed for {{the classification of}} the folding classes of protein structures and for a description of their relationship which {{can be useful in}} the determination of the folding type of a protein. For each of the folding classes, an ellipsoid in the multidimensional space was constructed from the 20 -D vectors of amino acid composition of its member proteins according to standard analytical geometry methods. From this representation, an ellipsoid-based scheme is then presented for determining the folding type of a protein {{on the basis of its}} elliptically scaled radial distances from ellipsoid centroids (rather than the conventional Euclidean distances) in a definitive and analytical manner. Among the 132 basis set proteins from which the ellipsoid representa-tions were derived, locations of their individual vectors give correct assignment of the folding type for 127 proteins; this success rate of 96 %, though better than those in previous studies, is established to be the theoretical upper limit only for the basis set proteins. Moreover, the geometrical descrip-tion of the relationship between amino acid composition and protein folding types derived from this analytical (rather than statistical) method indicates that amino add composition alone cannot determine the protein folding type <b>hi</b> <b>all</b> cases. The high success rate for the basis set proteins nevertheless suggests that the ellipsoid representation and the elliptically scaled distances can be more successful in determining the folding type of a protein from its amino acid composition than other analytical approaches reported previously.

We investigated the presence of antibodies against the most prevalent arboviruses. OBJECTIVES This study was aimed at evaluating some clinical and physical parameters of domestic pigeons, including the presence of antibodies to Amazon-endemic arboviruses. METHODS Eighty-five healthy pigeons were captured in Mangal das Garças Park, in Belém, and were bled. Upon capture, the birds were subjected to a clinical examination in search of alterations that could indicate the presence of arboviruses. Blood samples were converted to serum and tested using the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) technique with a panel of 19 antigens of arboviruses circulating in the Amazon. The confirmation assay for the positive reactions to the viral species tested by HI was a neutralisation test in new-born Swiss albino mice (Mus musculus) [mouse neutralisation test (MNT) ]. FINDINGS A total of 10 (11. 8 %) serum samples tested positive for antiflavivirus antibodies by <b>HI.</b> <b>All</b> the samples positive for the HI test were subjected to MNT for detection of viruses and yielded negative results (logarithmic neutralisation index < 1. 7). MAIN CONCLUSION The results represent the first serological detection of antiarbovirus antibodies in domestic pigeons as potential hosts of arboviruses in Brazil. The detection of haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies against genus Flavivirus indicated that there was recent contact between the analysed domestic pigeons and these arboviruses.

40|$|Background: Evidences {{from animal}} models have {{demonstrated}} that depletion of brain serotonin (5 -HT), a neurotransmitter with {{a pivotal role in}} neurodevelopment and brain plasticity, lowers the threshold to induced seizures. It was also demonstrated that anti-epileptic drugs increase endogenous 5 -HT concentrations and that 5 HT- 1 B receptors could have an anticonvulsant role. Association studies {{have demonstrated that}} a polymorphism (rs 6296) in 5 HTR- 1 B gene may be a susceptibility factor for with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) development. The rs 6296 G allele has been associated with decreased receptor activity. Our aim was to analyse the association between rs 6296 and the development and clinical features of Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE) in a Portuguese population. Material and methods: A cohort of 121 MTLE patients (67 F, 54 M, mean age = 44 ± 11 years, age of onset = 13 ± 9 years) was compared with a cohort of 192 healthy individuals (<b>HI).</b> <b>All</b> patients had Hippocampal Sclerosis (MTLE–HS). Genotyping was performed by TaqMan real time PCR methodology. Results: rs 6296 G allele was overrepresented in MTLE patients compared to controls (80. 2 % in MTLE vs 72. 1 % in HI, p = 0. 029 OR = 1. 561 (1. 060 – 2. 298)). We constituted 2 MTLE–HS sub-groups, according to febrile seizure antecedents and no differences in rs 6596 allelic or genotypic frequencies were found. Conclusion: The rs 6296 G allele may be a susceptibility factor to MTLE–HS development. Since these receptors have an anticonvulsant role, a reduction in their activity could lower the threshold for seizure development. Supported by a BICE Tecnifar Grant 201...|$|E

We combine high resolution [CII] spectra taken with the HIFI spectrometer onboard the Herschel satellite with [CII] Herschel-PACS maps and ground-based observations of CO(2 - 1) and <b>HI.</b> <b>All</b> data are at a common spatial resolution of 50 pc. Typically, the [CII] lines have widths intermediate between the narrower CO(2 - 1) and broader HI line profiles. We decomposed the [CII] spectra in terms of contribution from molecular and atomic gas detected in CO(2 - 1) and HI, respectively. We find that the relative contribution of molecular and atomic gas traced by CO(2 - 1) and HI varies depends mostly on the local physical conditions and geometry. We estimate that 11 - 60 % and 5 - 34 % of the [CII] intensities in the center and in BCLMP 302, respectively, arise at velocities showing no CO(2 - 1) or HI emission and could arise in CO-dark molecular gas. The deduced strong variation in the [CII] emission not associated with CO and HI cannot be explained in terms of differences in A_v, far-ultraviolet radiation field, and metallicity between the two studied regions. Hence the relative amounts of diffuse (CO-dark) and dense molecular gas possibly vary on spatial scales smaller than 50 pc. Based on the emission measure observed at radio wavelengths we estimate the contribution of ionized gas at a few positions to lie between 10 - 25 %. The correlations between the intensities of tracers corresponding to the same velocity range as [CII], differ from the correlation derived from PACS data. The results in this paper emphasize the need for velocity-resolved observations to discern the contribution of different components of the ISM to [CII] emission. (abridged...|$|E

HI imaging of 55 galaxies with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope reveals morphological and kinematic signatures of ongoing interactions and gas accretion. We probe a total volume of 485 Mpc(3) within the voids, with an angular resolution of 8 kpc at an average distance of 85 Mpc. We reach column density sensitivities of 5 x 10 (19) cm(- 2), corresponding to an HI mass limit of 3 x 10 (8) M-circle dot. We detect HI in 41 galaxies, with total masses ranging from 1. 7 x 10 (8) to 5. 5 x 10 (9) M-circle dot. The upper limits on the 14 non-detections are not inconsistent with their luminosities, given their expected HI mass-to-light ratios. We find that the void galaxies are generally gas-rich, low-luminosity, blue disk galaxies, with optical and HI properties that are not unusual for their luminosity and morphology. The sample spans a range of absolute magnitudes (- 16. 1 > M-r > - 20. 4) and colors (0. 06 <g - r < 0. 87), and includes disk and irregular galaxies.

40|$|Background: In vitro hemolysis, the {{prevailing}} cause of preanalytical error in routine laboratory diagnostics, might influence {{the reliability of}} several tests, {{affect the quality of}} the total testing process and jeopardize patient safety. Although laboratory instrumentation is now routinely equipped with systems capable of automatically testing and eventually correcting for hemolysis interference, to our knowledge there are no reports that have compared the efficiency of different analytical platforms for identifying and classifying specimens with hemolysis. Methods: Serum from a healthy volunteer was spiked with varying amounts of hemolyzed blood from the same volunteer, providing a serum free hemoglobin concentration ranging from 0. 0  g/L to 2. 0  g/L as measured by the reference cyanmethemoglobin assay. The spiked serum samples were shipped to seven separate laboratories and the hemolysis index (HI) was tested in triplicate on the following analytical platforms: Roche Modular System P (n= 4) and Integra 400 Plus (n= 1), Siemens Dimension RxL (n= 3), ADVIA 2400 (n= 1) and ADVIA 1800 (n= 1), Olympus AU 680 (n= 1) and Coulter DXC 800 (n= 1). Results: Satisfactory agreement of HI results was observed among the various analytical platforms, despite a trend toward overestimation by the ADVIA 2400 and 1800. After normalizing results according to the instrument-specific alert value, discrepancies were considerably reduced. All instruments except for the Dimension RxL gave values normalized to the instrument-specific alert value, &# 60; 1. 0 for the sample with 0. 048  g/L free hemoglobin, and &# 62; 1. 0 for the sample with 0. 075  g/L free hemoglobin. The results of the four Modular System P tests were also highly reproducible among the different facilities. When evaluating instruments that provided quantitative HI results, the mean intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) calculated for the triplicate determinations was always between 0. 1 % and 2. 7 %. Conclusions: The results of this multicenter evaluation confirm that efficiency of different analytical platforms to correctly identify and classify unsuitable samples is satisfactory. However, more effort should be placed on the standardization of reporting <b>HI.</b> <b>All</b> the instruments that we tested provide either quantitative or qualitative results that are essentially comparable, but which should always be compared with the instrument-specific alert values to harmonize their efficiency.

40|$|The first aim of {{the study}} was to conduct an {{epidemiological}} research on the prevalence of AIV in urban and wild pigeons. For this, cloacal and tracheal swabbing as well as blood collections was carried out on 152 urban pigeons (Columba livia form. urbana) from Berlin, 103 from Hamburg, 113 from Munich and 40 pigeons from Hannover. None of the investigated 408 cloacal- and 322 tracheal swabs of the urban pigeons showed Influenza A viruspositive results either by virus isolation trail in SPF chicken eggs or by realtime reverse transverase polymerase chain reaction PCR (RT-qPCR). As a secondary finding it was possible to isolate avian Paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV- 1) in three urban pigeons from Berlin. The concurrent investigation of 364 sera from the urban pigeons using a competitive multispecies Influenza A-specific ELISA as well as agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGID) revealed no group-specific Influenza A antibodies. Likewise, hemagglutination inhibition test (HI) revealed no antibodies specific for the AIV hemagglutinin subtypes H 5 and H 7. Samples from 170 shot wild pigeons (wood pigeons (Columba palumbus)) from North Rhine-Westphalia (170 cloacal and tracheal swabs, 123 sera) were investigated. In contrast to the urban pigeons, it was possible to detect group-specific Influenza A virus antibodies in two sera of the wild pigeons using the competitive multi-species Influenza A-specific ELISA, while AGID failed to confirm this result. Antibodies against AIV subtypes H 5 and could not be detected using HI. A subsequent analysis of the “National Wild Bird Data Base” in collaboration with the Institute of Epidemiology of the Friedrich Loeffler-Institute (Wusterhausen/Dosse) consistently showed no AIV detections in pigeons during the years 2006 to 2008. Therefore, even after the occurrence of highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H 5 N 1 (HPAIV H 5 N 1) in Germany, this study could not demonstrate that pigeons play an essential role in the propagation of AIV infections. Likewise, this study could not prove a high risk for humans to become infected with AIV through the contact with urban and wild pigeons in Germany. The second part of the study aimed at the question, if falconry plays a role in the epidemiology of Avian Influenza and if falconers would be at a higher risk to come into contact with AIV compared to the rest of the human population. Samples from 1080 prey birds (1080 cloacal and 1012 tracheal swabs) that were hunted with falconry birds were investigated over two hunting seasons (2006 / 2007 und 2007 / 2008) using RT-qPCR and VI. It was possible to detect AIV-specific RNA in three gulls (Laridae sp.) and two mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). The AIV-positive samples corresponded to 4, 1 % of all investigated 74 gull samples and 3, 8 % of all 53 duck samples. Molecular subtyping using RT-qPCR, RT-PCR and microarray revealed one H 13 N 6 and two N 6 in the gulls (hemagglutinin subtyping failed in two gulls). In addition, H 3 N 2 as well as a double infection with H 3 N 2 and H 9 N 2 were detected in the two ducks. By comparing the results of this study with data from the „National wild Bird Database“ and literature on AIV-prevalence in wild birds, it can be noticed that falconry birds, despite their selective hunting style, do not catch AIV-infected avian prey birds at a high rate. In 37 cloacal swabs, 40 choanal swabs and 51 sera from the 54 falconry birds no evidence of current or former infection with AIV could be shown. To evaluate the risk of falconers to come into contact with AIV, the falconers were first asked to complete a questionnaire on their hunting habits and then donated blood for serological investigation. Although all falconers showed positive results using the competitive multi-species Influenza A-ELISA, antibodies against AIV subtypes H 5, H 7, H 9 and H 13 could not be detected using microneutralization assay and <b>HI.</b> <b>All</b> in all this study could not prove a higher risk for falconers to come into contact with AIV compared with the rest of the human population in Germany without contact to wild birds. All the same this study did not show any evidence that falconry birds may serve as a vector for the transmission of avian influenza viruses between wild birds and men. Falconry plays, if at all, only a minor role in the epidemiology of AIV in Germany...|$|E
