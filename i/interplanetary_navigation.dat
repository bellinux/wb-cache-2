A concept is presented for attaining improved target ephemeris accuracy using two future Earth-orbiting optical observatories, the European Space Agency (ESA) Hipparcos observatory and the Nasa Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Assuming nominal observatory performance, the Hipparcos data reduction {{will provide an}} accurate global star catalog, and HST will provide a capability for accurate angular measurements of stars and solar system bodies. The target location concept employs HST to observe solar system bodies relative to Hipparcos catalog stars and to determine the orientation (frame tie) of these stars to compact extragalactic radio sources. The target location process is described, the major error sources discussed, the potential target ephemeris error predicted, and mission applications identified. Preliminary results indicate that ephemeris accuracy comparable to the errors in individual Hipparcos catalog stars may be possible with a more extensive HST observing program.

Computer software examines the Faraday data, resolves the pi ambiguities, constructs a continuous Faraday-rotation profile and converts the profile to columnar zenith total electron content at the ionospheric reference point; a second program computes the line-of-sight ionospheric correction for each pass of the spacecraft over each tracking complex. Line-of-sight ionospheric electron content using mapped Faraday-rotation data is compared with that using dispersive Doppler {{data from the}} Voyager spacecraft; a difference of about 0. 4 meters, or 5 x 10 to the 16 th electrons/sq m is obtained.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that <b>interplanetary</b> <b>navigation</b> at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is {{performed}} by analyzing measurements derived from the radio link between spacecraft and earth and, near the target, onboard optical measurements. For precise navigation, corrections for ionospheric effects must be applied, because the earth's ionosphere degrades {{the accuracy of the}} radiometric data. These corrections are based on ionospheric total electron content (TEC) determinations. The determinations are based on the measurement of the Faraday rotation of linearly polarized VHF signals from geostationary satellites. Problems arise in connection with the steadily declining number of satellites which are suitable for Faraday rotation measurements. For this reason, alternate methods of determining ionospheric electron content are being explored. One promising method involves the use of satellites of the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS).

40|$|Carrying six science {{instruments}} and three engineering payloads, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) {{is the first}} mission in a low Mars orbit to characterize the surface, subsurface, and atmospheric properties with unprecedented detail. After a seven-month interplanetary cruise, MRO arrived at Mars executing a 1. 0 km/s Mars Orbit Insertion (MOI) maneuver. MRO achieved a 430 km periapsis altitude with the final orbit solution indicating that only 10 km was attributable to navigation prediction error. With the last interplanetary maneuver performed four months before MOI, this was a significant accomplishment. This paper describes the navigation analyses and results during the 210 -day interplanetary cruise. As of August 2007 MRO has returned more than 18 Terabits of scientific data {{in support of the}} objectives set by the Mars Exploration Program (MEP).
