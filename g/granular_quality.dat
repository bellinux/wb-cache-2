40|$|Abstract—Channel coding such as Reed-Solomon (RS) and {{convolutional}} codes {{has been}} widely used to protect video transmission in wireless networks. However, this type of channel coding can effectively correct error bits only if the error rate is smaller than a given threshold; when the bit error rate is underestimated, the effectiveness of channel coding drops dramatically {{and so does the}} decoded video quality. In this paper, we propose a low-complex, scalable video coding architecture based on compressive sensing (SVCCS) for wireless unicast and multicast transmissions. SVCCS achieves good scalability, error resilience and coding efficiency. SVCCS encoded bitstream is divided into base and enhancement layers. The layered structure provides quality and temporal scalability. While in the enhancement layer, the CS measurements provide fine <b>granular</b> <b>quality</b> scalability. In addition, we incorporate the state-of-the-art technologies to improve the compressive sensing coding efficiency. Experimental results show that SVCCS is more effective and efficient for wireless videocast than the existing solutions. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{rheological}} behaviour of granular sludges (diameter 20 - 315 ¿m) originating from different anaerobic reactors {{was carried out}} using rotation tests. The sieved granular sludges suspensions display a non-Newtonian {{rheological behaviour}} and the limit viscosity was therefore used as a rheological parameter. The values obtained, which depend on the shear rate used, were strongly influenced by the total suspended solids (TSS) content of granular sludge and an exponential relation {{was found between the}} TSS and the rheological parameter limit viscosity. The increase of viscosity as a function of TSS content of the granular sludge as well as the increase of granule size underlines the importance of the interaction between granules in the evolution of this rheological parameter. Significant differences in granular sludge limit viscosity were found for granular sludge of different origins. All measurements performed with 10 g·l- 1 TSS granular sludge indicate the ability of the chosen rheological parameter to describe different <b>granular</b> sludge <b>quality...</b>|$|R

50|$|Neoweb can be {{considered}} a sustainable road construction method as by improving the structural properties of low strength materials, it enables the replacement of quarry aggregate with lower cost lower <b>quality</b> <b>granular</b> infill materials. These lower quality materials include locally available but weak soils, sand; recycled and reclaimed construction materials, such as recycled concrete and industrial byproducts, such as fly ash and furnace slag. Not only does the use of such materials in road construction conserve quarry resources and recycle waste. It also reduces quarry, haul and infill activities, which in turn decreases the amounts of fuel, pollution and the carbon footprint. Neoweb reinforcement can also increase the lifespan of pavement structures, which means less repairs and maintenance, further enhancing sustainability.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{two-dimensional}} rotating agglomerator {{was developed}} {{to carry out the}} flow induced phase inversion (FIPI) based granulation. The process in this agglomerator shows that a continuous paste flow (mixed with liquid binder and primary particles) is extruded into the interstice of two relatively rotating disks, as the paste becomes solidified due to the loss of heat to the disks, it is then broken into granules by the shearing force imposed by the rotating disk. Experimental measurements have shown that the size of these granules is enlarged along the positive radial direction of the disks. It is also found that these granules contain approximately the same quantity of binder in terms of its volume fraction. The paper thus proposes a population balance (PB) model to describe the growth of the granules by considering a size independent agglomeration kernel. The PB simulated results are found to be well capable of describing the change of the particle size distribution (PSD) of the granules in the radial direction. This study also proposes a velocity profile for the paste flow and attempts to establish a quantitative relationship between the granulation rate and the deformation rate as this would help us understand the mechanism of the agglomeration. It is hoped that this study would be used to improve the design of the agglomerator and to assure the control of the process and the <b>granular</b> product <b>quality...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a {{computational}} parameter space study of mixing protocols for a half-full bi-axial spherical <b>granular</b> tumbler. The <b>quality</b> of mixing is quantified via the intensity of segregation (concentration variance) and computed {{as a function of}} three system parameters: angles of rotation about each tumbler axis and the flowing layer depth. Only the symmetric case is considered in which the flowing layer depth is the same for each rotation. We also consider the dependence on R̅, which parametrizes the concentric spheroids ("shells") that comprise the volume of the tumbler. The intensity of segregation is computed over 100 periods of the mixing protocol for each choice of parameters. Each curve is classified via a time constant, τ, and an asymptotic mixing value, bias. We find that most choices of angles and most shells throughout the tumbler volume mix well, with mixing {{near the center of the}} tumbler being consistently faster (small τ) and more complete (small bias). We conclude with examples and discussion of the pathological mixing behaviors of the outliers in the so-called τ-bias scatterplots.

The original process configuration operated for almost 50 years before being upgraded in 1988. This upgrading was mainly due to the eutrophication of the impoundment. The new plant worked excellently under normal conditions but certain serious problems did occur and full production could not be maintained at all times. Activated Carbon and Ozone are two possible solutions to these problems. This study was directed at investigating the possible implementation of Preozonation, Granular Activated Carbon, and Ozone and Granular Activated Carbon in combination (case study), and it was shown that: All these processes are beneficial to the final water quality. Pre-ozonation {{proved to be the}} most cost effective process, but the least effective process in improvement of the water <b>quality.</b> Ozone and <b>Granular</b> Activated Carbon in combination proved to be the least cost effective process, but should be the most effective in improvement of the water <b>quality.</b> <b>Granular</b> Activated Carbon proved to be the optimun process with regard to cost and water quality improvement.

40|$|Fine coal may be {{separated}} from an aqueous suspension of coal and mineral particles {{through the application of}} a pure oil. The pure oil preferentially wets and agglomerates only the coal, forming a high <b>quality,</b> <b>granular</b> product. However, the use of the pure oil also comes at a relatively high cost and this cost prohibits commercial implementation of this process. In this work a new, economic binder, was introduced. This binder consisted of a high internal phase water-in-oil emulsion which was 95. vol% water and 5. vol% organic. This type of binder was selected as it possessed the hydrophobic surface functionality of oil while the space filling functionality of the binder was primarily satisfied by the dispersed water droplets within the emulsion. The application of this emulsion in the agglomeration process led to a 10 -fold reduction in the organic liquid dosage required to achieve agglomeration as compared a pure oil binder. It was also observed that the agglomeration time required when using the emulsion binder was one order of magnitude less than required when using a pure oil binder. This variation was considered to result from the five orders of magnitude difference in the viscosity of the two binders...|$|R
40|$|<b>Quality</b> <b>granular</b> {{materials}} {{suitable for}} building all-weather roads are not uniformly {{distributed throughout the}} state of Iowa. For this reason the Iowa Highway Research Board has sponsored a number of research programs {{for the purpose of}} developing new and effective methods for making use of whatever materials are locally available. This need is ever more pressing today due to the decreasing availability of road funds and quality materials, and the increasing costs of energy and all types of binder materials. In the 1950 s, Professor L. H. Csanyi of Iowa State University had demonstrated both in the laboratory and in the field, in Iowa and in a number of foreign countries, the effectiveness of preparing low cost mixes by stabilizing ungraded local aggregates such as gravel, sand and loess with asphalt cements using the foamed asphalt process. In this process controlled foam was produced by introducing saturated steam at about 40 psi into heated asphalt cement at about 25 psi through a specially designed and properly adjusted nozzle. The reduced viscosity and the increased volume and surface energy in the foamed asphalt allowed intimate coating and mixing of cold, wet aggregates or soils. Through the use of asphalt cements in a foamed state, materials normally considered unsuitable could be used in the preparation of mixes for stabilized bases and surfaces for low traffic road construction. By attaching the desired number of foam nozzles, the foamed asphalt can be used in conjunction with any type of mixing plant, either stationary or mobile, batch or continuous, central plant or in-place soil stabilization...|$|R
40|$|Roads form a {{key element}} for the {{expansion}} of economy and development of a country. As with most countries, Brunei Darussalam has been facing a rapid development to meet the economic growth that requires an efficient road network. Therefore, the scarcity of conventional road aggregates in Brunei Darussalam means that the country has a strong dependence on imported aggregates from overseas to construct quality roads. Further restrictions on local road specifications make it almost impossible to include low <b>quality</b> <b>granular</b> materials. The study reported in this thesis was undertaken on the basis that the dependence on overseas resources is not a viable long- term solution. The research task has been, therefore, to ascertain the quality of local sandstones for road construction and then to propose means to upgrade their performance quality for optimum utilisation in cost effective applications. This study focused on the road base layer since that is where most aggregate is used. The approach used for this study was to identify the common rock in Brunei Darussalam and review the candidate treatment methods. A weighted matrix for these candidate treatment methods was constructed to determine the overall ranking with selected key criteria {{on the basis of the}} local climatic condition, construction preferences and traditions. From the reviews, Foamed bitumen was selected as a feasible treatment method that can improve the sandstone characteristics under local conditions. Three curing conditions were adopted in this study, simulating extreme field conditions in Brunei Darussalam, to characterise the mechanical properties of foamed bitumen stabilised sandstone mixtures, termed 'foam mix'. The following tests were conducted...|$|R
40|$|The Thesis {{presents}} an in-depth study of arcing behaviour of H. B. C. Fuses {{for a range}} of fuse elements and fillers, under critical current conditions. The methodologies used were the standard breaking capacity short-circuit test plus the application of crow-bar, Xray studies, metallographic microscopic and optical fiber arc detection techniques. Due to the observation of some unknown and puzzling arc phenomena it was decided to pursue the arc investigation by an extensive test programme of single uniform wire fuse elements. From the investigation a basic arc mechanism for the pre-peak and post-peak arcs period was discovered. The new mechanism was applied to single wire, strip, long notched, medium notched and short notched fuse elements and to paralleled wires and strips immersed in three quartz filler types: standard sand, high <b>quality</b> <b>granular</b> quartz and bound quartz in two different sizes. The proposed arc mechanism was modelled by a computer program which was used to simulate the described fuse constructions. The results of over 800 tests and subsequent simulation undoubtedly confirm that the proposed arc mechanism is applicable for the described fuse types. The experimental and analytical results are close enough to justify the model application for fuse designers and fuse users. A critical comparison of the experimental and analytical results with previous findings published by other researchers is presented. A detailed arc mechanism and the key behaviour rules are proposed, they are: " Maximum column voltage can not exceed the arc-root voltage. " The arc-root voltage and the initial dv/dt values are influenced by filler characteristics and are able to precisely characterize the filler behaviour. " The dv/dt, and consequently the burn-back are instantaneous current density functions. The application of the above rules allows the fuse designer to tailor the fuse element in order to obtain specific current and arc voltage waveforms. It is believed that the proposed arc mechanism and computer model is able to explain some puzzling are phenomena and eventually could be applied to predicting other low overload H. B. C. fuse behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. There are {{currently}} well established compaction methods {{being used in}} laboratories globally to prepare specimens for material testing. None of these methods provides the repeatability and reproducibility, ease of execution or simulation and correlation to field compaction desired by engineers. The research presented in this report was aimed at {{the development of a}} new or adapted compaction method for bituminous stabilized materials (BSM) that would address the aforementioned factors, by making use of a vibratory hammer. Along with this, a new protocol was to be established. The initial vibratory hammer that was tested was the Kango 637 ®. This specific vibratory hammer suffered irreparable damage to the gearbox during the research. A replacement Kango hammer could not be purchased, therefore a substitute hammer was purchased i. e. a Bosch GSH 11 E®, for which back-up service and replacement parts are readily available throughout South Africa. Significant progress had been made with the development of a laboratory compaction protocol for BSM using the Kango Hammer. The specifications of the Bosch® hammer showed it was superior in terms of power, weight and other technical features. Comparative testing was therefore carried out. This allowed for the adaptation of the results achieved to that point. Extensive experimentation was then carried out using two types of BSM i. e. foamed bitumen (80 / 100 bitumen) and bitumen emulsion (60 / 40 Anionic Stable Grade) stabilized material. The initial material used for the experimentation was a G 2 quality graded crushed stone. Additional material was also obtained from a recycling project taking place along the N 7 near Cape Town. The N 7 material was used to perform correlation experiments so as to determine how representative the laboratory compacted specimens were to field compacted material. Results showed that the vibratory hammer is capable of producing specimens for testing in the laboratory as well as providing a possible benchmark method for accurately controlling the quality of work on site i. e. field density control. This was done by identifying the time to and level of refusal density compaction. The level of refusal density compaction was expressed as a percentage of Mod AASHTO compaction and using current specifications, a potentially new site compaction level specification was determined. In order to asses the material applicability of the vibratory hammer compaction method, tests regarding moisture sensitivity analysis were carried out on a G 5 material. The vibratory compaction protocol includes a specification for the type of hammer, guide-frame, surcharge weight, compaction moisture and number of layers. Vibratory compaction can be used to prepare two types of specimens: • Specimens for triaxial testing with a diameter of 150 mm and a height of 300 mm • Specimens for laboratory testing with a diameter of 150 mm and a height of 125 mm. Tests showed that the material properties prove to have an influence on the compactability of the material. Material from the N 7 recycling project had been milled out thus altering the grading and including some RAP. This in turn influenced compaction. The vibratory hammer moisture curve was found to shift slightly to the left when compared to the Mod AASHTO moisture curve. The variability of the vibratory hammer was found to be well below the specified variability of 15 %. Repeatability experiments on G 5 material indicate that vibratory hammer compaction may be used on lesser <b>quality</b> <b>granular</b> materials. A recommended procedure for the compaction of BSM was developed following the experimentation results...|$|R
