40|$|The paper {{describes}} the designing of a closed loop {{model of the}} dc motor drive for controlling speed. Accuracy and the dynamic responses are better in a closed loop system. In the closed loop system, acceleration and the deceleration of the motor can be controlled according to the requirement. In order to regulate drives automatically, the controlled variables are measured. A tachogenerator is used for this purpose. The output of the tachogenerators is compared with a preset reference voltage. The differences between these two signals are fed as an actuating signal to control {{the elements of the}} system. Control amplifiers are used as both comparators and amplifiers. As a small change in the voltage can cause a large change in the motor current and lead to a particular drive control feature. There are two closed paths in the dc control scheme. One is the outer speed control loop and the other is the inner current control loop. Both the loops are controlled with the help of P-I controllers having their own gains and the time constants according to the requirement of the system. The output of the speed P-I controller which is the function of the speed error is used to command for current P-I controller and compared with armature current. The current P-I controller output control the triggering circuit of the converter. The armature current tends to increase to a large value when the motor is accelerating. A current limit can be obtained in this system by limiting the maximum current command voltage. If the motor speed drops below the set point, the resulting error signal causes the <b>gate</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> to advance the firing pulses, and increase the rectifier output voltage.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a low-complexity and low cost <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> in 180 nm {{technology}} for ground penetrating ultra-wideband (UWB) radar system applications. Here I have implemented an UWB <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> circuit. A UWB <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> is a method introduced in communication system to simplify the data transmission and remove disadvantages that occurs in other systems. This generator generates a Gaussian pulse for a small period of time {{of the order of}} some nanoseconds. As UWB pulses are generated for a short time, hence no carrier signal is required to send a base band or message signal. So power loss due to carrier signal doesn’t exist at all. These pulses are very high in frequency; hence it has very less chance to be got affected by noise. This <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> uses a delay generator along with a Gilbert XOR cell for generating a Gaussian pulse which can be shaped by using a FIR filter, and finally a Gaussian mono cycle pulse is observed at the output which has a pulse width of 97 ps thereby give rise to a bandwidth of 10. 3 GHz which meet the FCC requirements. The <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> comprises of three cascaded delay blocks, a XOR block, and a FIR filter. The interpolation delay blocks uses voltage for adjusting the delay time by the control of the gains of each path. By adjusting the delay time, <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> can achieve the required frequency. The XOR gate is implemented using a Gilbert cell. When the two signals given as input have opposite voltage levels at a given time, the XOR <b>gate</b> creates a <b>pulse.</b> After the XOR <b>gate,</b> a Gaussian <b>pulse</b> is generated and then it goes through the FIR filter to shape it to a Gaussian mono cycle pulse. The design and simulation of the <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> was performed using the Cadence UMC tool in 180 nm CMOS process...|$|R

This thesis describes the construction and tests of several inductive high power <b>pulse</b> <b>generators.</b> The <b>pulse</b> <b>generators</b> were designed {{with the intent to}} deliver a pulse with fast rise time and rectangular voltage.
