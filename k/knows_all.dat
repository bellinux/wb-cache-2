5|$|Horace Holly – protagonist and narrator, Holly is a Cambridge {{man whose}} keen intellect and {{knowledge}} {{was developed to}} compensate for his ape-like appearance. Holly knows a number of ancient languages, including Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew, which allow him {{to communicate with the}} Amahagger (who speak a form of Arabic) and She (who <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> three languages). Holly's interest in archaeology and the origins of civilisation lead him to explore the ruins of Kôr.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is {{informed}} by Don Geiss's (Rip Torn) estate lawyer Thomas (Burke Moses) {{that he is in}} Don Geiss's will. Jack is excited at the idea of owning a piece of Geiss's legacy as Jack considered Geiss his mentor. At the will reading, Jack inherits Geiss's beloved pet peacock named Argus. When Argus begins acting peculiar, Jack enlists the help of NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). Kenneth—who <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> the peafowl calls—tells Jack that Argus muttered senpai and kōhai—master and pupil—nicknames that Geiss and Jack had for each other (a ruse conceived by Liz, who knew of the nicknames). Immediately, Jack is convinced that Geiss's soul has inhabited Argus, prompting Jack to release his grief to Argus and finally accepting Geiss's death.|$|E
5|$|This sparks the rumour mill yet again, as {{students}} {{around the school}} suspect Harry of being the Heir of Slytherin (as Slytherin was also a parselmouth), and circumstantial evidence to support this theory arrives {{in the form of}} another attack, this time on Hufflepuff second-year Justin Finch Fletchley and the Gryffindor ghost. Harry, Ron, and Hermione begin to suspect that Draco is behind the attacks, given his family history of remaining well within Slytherin ranks and open hostility toward Muggle-born students, and so Hermione concocts Polyjuice potion, which allows them to become Draco’s boorish lackeys, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, for an hour to interrogate him. This comes to nothing, as Draco’s father only told his son the general facts of the previous opening of the Chamber and that it occurred fifty years previously. Meanwhile, Myrtle Warren, an existentially mopey ghost that haunts a bathroom, unwittingly provides a new clue {{in the form of a}} diary deposited in her stall—a diary, moreover, that belonged to Tom Riddle, a student who <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> too well about the Chamber, having been witness to a fellow student’s death fifty years ago. The culprit, he reveals to Harry, was none other than Rubeus Hagrid, now gamekeeper for Hogwarts School; when Hermione is attacked next, alongside a Ravenclaw prefect, the school is put on lockdown, and Dumbledore and Hagrid are forced to leave the premises.|$|E

25|$|Causal determinism: The {{idea that}} {{everything}} is caused by prior conditions, {{making it impossible for}} anything else to happen. In its most common form, nomological (or scientific) determinism, future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the laws of nature. Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the thought experiment of Laplace's demon. Imagine an entity that <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> facts about the past and the present, and <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> natural laws that govern the universe. If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.|$|E
25|$|The {{second point}} of {{contention}} between freewill and open theists is exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events. Freewill theists have traditionally affirmed {{what is known as}} simple foreknowledge according to which God, prior to creation, just “sees” or <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> that will ever happen in history. Sanders argues that the simple foreknowledge view has conflicts with types of biblical texts mentioned below and has two philosophical problems. The first problem is the old debate about whether or not divine foreknowledge entails determinism. Open theists argue that exhaustive definite foreknowledge is incompatible with the freewill of creatures. The other problem with simple foreknowledge is that it is useless for God to possess it since once God knows {{what is going to happen}} God cannot change it from happening. Sanders argues that simple foreknowledge cannot explain such things as prophecy, divine guidance, or why God did not prevent particular evils. Instead, open theists affirm “dynamic omniscience” (a term coined by Sanders). God <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> that has happened in the past and all that is happening in the present. God knows those future events that are determined to occur and God <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> that could possibly happen but does not know as definite what creatures with freewill will do. God has anticipatory knowledge (foresight) of what we are likely to do so God is not caught off-guard.|$|E
25|$|In {{the poem}} Lokasenna, where Loki accuses nearly every female in {{attendance}} of promiscuity or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between Loki and Freyja. The {{introduction to the}} poem notes that among other gods and goddesses, Freyja attends a celebration held by Ægir. In verse, after Loki has flyted with the goddess Frigg, Freyja interjects, telling Loki that he is insane for dredging up his terrible deeds, and that Frigg knows the fate of everyone, though she does not tell it. Loki tells her to be silent, and says that he <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> about herthat Freyja is not lacking in blame, {{for each of the}} gods and elves in the hall have been her lover. Freyja objects. She says that Loki is lying, that he is just looking to blather about misdeeds, and since the gods and goddesses are furious at him, he can expect to go home defeated. Loki tells Freyja to be silent, calls her a malicious witch, and conjures a scenario where Freyja was once astride her brother when all of the gods, laughing, surprised the two. Njörðr interjectshe says that a woman having a lover other than her husband is harmless, and he points out that Loki has borne children, and calls Loki a pervert. The poem continues in turn.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{has become}} study {{material}} for sociology courses at University of California Berkeley, {{where it is}} used to [...] "examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects". In the book , Duncan Beard said the episode served as a parody of the peculiarities of the American convenience store. Beard particularly cited the Muzak and the dinging bell as Homer and Apu entered the Kwik-E-Mart in India, and the sign that read, [...] "The Master <b>Knows</b> <b>All</b> (except combination to safe)". Beard said, [...] "Here the show presents its own instance of the global culture of consumer capitalism, transplanted intact and indistinguishably unaltered from the suburbs of America to a mountain top in some indefinable region of the post-partitioned Commonwealth nation of India, purely for the purpose of parodically criticizing the banality of quick-stop stores." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{the singer}} has never {{mentioned}} physical abuse in her family, she had mentioned {{that her father}} was a disciplinarian and her stepmother was hard on her. Author Lucy O'Brien wrote in her book Madonna: Like an Icon that the song stemmed more from the emotional neglect that Madonna faced, with her father locked up in grief after Mrs. Ciccone died. When he married again, his new wife was wrapped up with her own children, so the older kids were often left to their own devices. O'Brien believed that for this reason, Madonna's girlhood would have been without much joy, and that [...] "Oh Father" [...] was a potent example of the singer using her imagination to escape from her troubled childhood, while blaming it on her father. Tony later said, [...] "Maybe I'm not the greatest father in the world, but life wasn't easy for us, and Nonni [...] <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> of this." ...|$|E
