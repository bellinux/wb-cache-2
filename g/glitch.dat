5|$|Shortly {{after the}} game's release in North America, a game-breaking <b>glitch</b> was {{discovered}} in the Nintendo 3DS version: saving the game in specific Escape sections would corrupt the saved game's data, forcing the player to restart the game from the beginning. In response, Aksys Games recommended that players avoid saving during Escape sections. By 2013, Aksys Games announced that the <b>glitch</b> had been patched in the Nintendo eShop version, but some players continued to report that the <b>glitch</b> still existed.|$|E
5|$|The May 2007 title update and {{downloadable}} content {{were linked}} to a <b>glitch</b> which reset a number of players' saved games when they played the game's co-operative mode. The developers apologized for the <b>glitch</b> and offered a temporary workaround, however, saved games already lost to the <b>glitch</b> were not recoverable. On 16 May 2007, a further title update was released, resolving the issue, in addition to fixing issues {{with access to the}} Halo3 beta.|$|E
5|$|Vanellope {{participates in}} a race, but is {{attacked}} by King Candy. Vanellope's <b>glitch</b> reveals {{he is actually}} Turbo, who took over Sugar Rush, displacing Vanellope as the main character. Ralph, Felix, and Calhoun evacuate the game, but Vanellope cannot leave due to her <b>glitch.</b> When Calhoun points out the Cy-Bugs can be destroyed by a beacon of light as per Hero's Duty, Ralph decides to make Diet Cola Mountain erupt to replicate it. Ralph is confronted by Turbo, now fused with a Cy-Bug that devoured him, and Turbo carries him away. Ralph breaks free, hits the mountain, and causes it to erupt, but Vanellope saves him using her <b>glitch.</b> The volcanic beacon destroys the Cy-Bugs and Turbo.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to situate <b>glitching</b> in the discourse of emergence {{in the field of}} game studies. <b>Glitches</b> play an important part in modern game development and in the <b>glitching</b> community (Meades 2013). However, in theories about emergence in game studies (Juul 2002; Karlsen 2007), the subject of <b>glitching</b> is insufficiently addressed. Because <b>glitching</b> is such an essential element of modern games, it is necessary to situate this subject in the discourse of emergence. I argue that <b>glitching</b> is an emergent property in modern video games, and that through featuring <b>glitches,</b> emergence can be designed. I illustrate my arguments through conducting a critical discourse analysis (Jørgensen and Phillips 2002) of texts that surround my case study: the game Goat Simulator (Coffee Stain Studios 2014). This game is a simulation game parody, but acts as a ‘greatest hits album’ of <b>glitches</b> that occur in other games. Through analysing how players and critics use the terms rules, goals, users and gameplay, I illustrate and conclude that <b>glitching</b> is an emergent property on the level of game rules- and goals: <b>glitching</b> is a form of gameplay that is non-deductible from the game rules, and through <b>glitching,</b> unpredicted game strategies emerge to accomplish alternative game goals...|$|R
50|$|<b>Glitching</b> is an {{activity}} {{in which a person}} finds and exploits flaws or <b>glitches</b> in video games to achieve something that was not intended by the game designers. Gamers who engage in this practice are known as glitchers. <b>Glitches</b> can help or disable the player.|$|R
40|$|Several <b>glitches</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} in young, isolated radio pulsars, while a clear detection in accretion-powered X-ray pulsars is still lacking. We use the Pizzochero snowplow model for pulsar <b>glitches</b> as well as starquake models to determine {{for the first time}} the expected properties of <b>glitches</b> in accreting pulsars and their observability. Since some accreting pulsars show accretion-induced long-term spin-up, we also investigate the possibility that anti-glitches occur in these stars. We find that <b>glitches</b> caused by quakes in a slow accreting neutron star are very rare and their detection extremely unlikely. On the contrary, <b>glitches</b> and anti-glitches caused by a transfer of angular momentum between the superfluid neutron vortices and the non-superfluid component may take place in accreting pulsars more often. We calculate the maximum jump in angular velocity of an anti-glitch and we find that it is expected to be about 1 E- 5 - 1 E- 4 rad/s. We also note that since accreting pulsars usually have rotational angular velocities lower than those of isolated <b>glitching</b> pulsars, both <b>glitches</b> and anti-glitches are expected to have long rise and recovery timescales compared to isolated <b>glitching</b> pulsars, with <b>glitches</b> and anti-glitches appearing as a simple step in angular velocity. Among accreting pulsars, we find that GX 1 + 4 is the best candidate for the detection of <b>glitches</b> with currently operating X-ray instruments and future missions such as the proposed Large Observatory for X-ray Timing (LOFT) ...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePower supply underpowering and {{negative}} power supply <b>glitches</b> {{are commonly used}} {{for the purpose of}} injecting faults into secure circuits. The related fault injection mechanism has been extensively studied: it is based on setup time violations. Positive power supply <b>glitches</b> are also used to inject faults. However, an increase of the supply voltage is not consistent with a mechanism based on setup time violation. Besides, no research work has yet identified the corresponding mechanism. In this work, we report the use of an embedded delay-meter to monitor the core voltage of a programmable device exposed to power supply <b>glitches.</b> It permitted us to gain a further insight into the mechanism associated with power <b>glitches</b> and also to identify the injection mechanism of positive power supply <b>glitches...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of crystal <b>glitches</b> in EXAFS data is widely recognized {{and is usually}} dealt with during data analysis. However, in many cases, especially as samples become more dilute, the disruption of the data can become irretrievable. The advent of new, high output, double-crystal x-ray monochromators has made it necessary to investigate the cause of such <b>glitches</b> {{with a view to}} reducing them in the original data. The occurrence of multiple reflections within the crystal gives rise to the <b>glitches</b> seen in EXAFS data when the two crystals in a double-crystal monochromator are not accurately aligned. The results of a simple alignment of such a double-crystal monochromator are presented and show a reduction of the <b>glitches</b> in the recorded data. A purpose-built monochromator for further investigation of this problem is described and some results towards the further reduction of <b>glitches</b> are presented.

40|$|We use {{data from}} pulsar gamma-ray <b>glitches</b> {{recorded}} by the Fermi Large Area Telescope as input to theoretical models of gravitational wave signals the <b>glitches</b> might generate.

We estimate the signal-to-noise for all gamma-ray <b>glitches,</b> and discuss detectability with current gravity wave detectors.

The main antagonist of the Mario series, Bowser, tries to collect the Crystal Stars before Mario does instead of directly opposing Mario, though his attempts mostly become comedic relief. Luigi's role in the game consists of recounting his slapstick adventures in the Waffle Kingdom, and appears with party members of his own, many of whom do not like Luigi at all for unrelated reasons, juxtaposing the universal respect Mario's partners have for Mario.|$|E
