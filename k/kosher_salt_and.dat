50|$|The company sells over 110 {{varieties}} of salts, including pink Himalayan salt, smoked salts, {{black and white}} truffle salts, Fleur de sel, <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> more. The salts are imported from 14 countries, including Brazil, France and Italy. The company sells retail, bulk and wholesale volumes ranging from 5 ounces to 40,000 pounds. SaltWorks uses a combination of sifters, aspirators, and rare-earth magnets to detect and filter unwanted materials from its salt. SaltWorks fabricates most of its processing equipment on-site. The company does not use anti-caking agents or artificial flavors. All SaltWorks salts are certified kosher.|$|E
5000|$|The kimmelweck roll (sometimes spelled [...] "kummelweck" [...] or [...] "kümmelweck"), {{topped with}} <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> caraway seeds, gives the {{sandwich}} its {{name and a}} distinctive taste. Kümmel is the German word for caraway, and weck means [...] "roll" [...] in the south-western German dialects of the Saarland, Baden and Swabia areas (northern Germans generally say brötchen). However, the roll used for this American sandwich tends to be softer and fluffier than a standard German Kümmelbrötchen or Kümmelweck. In Austria, a similar type of small white-bread is known as Kümmelweckerl (diminutive from Wecken, which refers to a whole big bread, i.e. Brotwecken).|$|E
50|$|When {{tobacco is}} burned, oils from {{adjoining}} not yet ignited particles vaporize and condense into the existing cake {{on the walls}} of the bowl and shank. Over time, these oils can oxidize and turn rancid, causing the pipe to give a sour or bitter smoke. A purported countermeasure involves filling the bowl with <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> carefully wetting it with strong spirits. It is important to not use iodized salt, as the iodine and other additives may impart an unpleasant flavor. Regularly wiping out the bowl with spirits such as vodka or rum is helpful in preventing souring. Commercial pipe-sweetening products are also available.|$|E
50|$|Saltiness is {{the taste}} of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium. It is found in almost every food in low to {{moderate}} proportions to enhance flavor, although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant. There are {{many different types of}} salt, with each having a different degree of saltiness, including sea salt, fleur de sel, <b>kosher</b> <b>salt,</b> mined <b>salt,</b> <b>and</b> grey <b>salt.</b> Other than enhancing flavor, its significance is that the body needs and maintains a delicate electrolyte balance, which is the kidney's function. Salt may be iodized, meaning iodine has been added to it, a necessary nutrient that promotes thyroid function. Some canned foods, notably soups or packaged broths, tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer. Historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion. Similarly, dried foods also promote food safety.|$|R
40|$|Higher {{risks of}} food-borne illness {{associated}} with increased consumption of poultry products make it necessary to identify potential sources of contamination and apply intervention strategies that will prevent or {{minimize the risk of}} contamination during processing. This study investigated the effects of chemical and natural decontamination treatments including sprayed application of acidified calcium sulfate (ACS) in combination with -polylysine (EPL), dry-rubbing <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> coating <b>and</b> molten paraffin wax dipping application on microbial populations of broiler carcasses and parts. Treatments were evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing the numbers of artificially inoculated rifampicin resistant Salmonella Typhimurium strain NVSL 95 - 1776 on the skin surface of bone-in chicken breasts. General model procedures were used to find statistical differences (P 2 log reductions) were also observed in validation trials in both pre- and post-chilled samples when compared to non-treated pre- and post-chilled controls. Only for psychrotrophic counts, chilled and post-chill interventions did not have a significant effect (P> 0. 05). The use of molten paraffin wax caused < 0. 51 CFU/ml log reductions on rifampicin resistant Salmonella Typhimurium in chicken breasts. In addition, drip loss on kosher treated samples was 53. 8 % lower than non-treated counterparts. However, <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> application caused a decrease in lightness (*L values) and yellowness (*b values) on treated carcasses when compared to controls, redness (*a values) were not significantly affected. Results indicate that the combined use of ACS and EPL at the stated conditions and the coating application of <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> on broiler carcasses significantly reduce pathogen contamination and microbial indicator loads, thus providing an alternative validated antimicrobial intervention for potential use by the poultry industry...|$|R
50|$|<b>Koshering</b> <b>salt,</b> usually {{referred}} to as <b>kosher</b> <b>salt,</b> is a variety of edible salt popular in the US which has much larger grain size than some common table salt. Like common table <b>salt,</b> <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> consists mainly of the chemical compound sodium chloride.|$|R
50|$|There are {{multiple}} variants {{of the common}} roll, differing in size, type of flour used, and toppings. While traditionally plain, Kaiser-style rolls are today found topped with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, pumpkin kernels, linseed, or sunflower seeds. The Kaiser roll is a main part of a typical Austrian breakfast, usually served with butter and jam. It is often used as a bun for such popular sandwiches as hamburgers in America, and {{with a slice of}} Leberkäse in Germany (and Austria itself), though sliced Extrawurst and pickled gherkins (Wurstsemmel), or a type of Wiener Schnitzel (Schnitzelsemmel) are also used. A variation called a kimmelweck is topped with <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> caraway, and in the United States is an essential component of a Buffalo-area specialty, the beef on weck sandwich.|$|E
50|$|Rather than cubic crystals, <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> has a flat plate-like shape. <b>Kosher</b> <b>salt</b> {{may also}} have a hollow {{pyramidal}} shape. The flat form of <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> is usually made when cubic crystals are forced into this shape under pressure, usually between rollers. The pyramidal salt crystals are generally made by an evaporative process called the Alberger process. <b>Kosher</b> <b>salt</b> is usually manufactured with a grain size larger than table salt grains.|$|R
50|$|Because of its mineral {{complexity}} and coarse grain size, sel gris {{can be used}} both as a cooking <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> a finishing <b>salt.</b> Being much denser than table <b>and</b> <b>kosher</b> <b>salt,</b> {{there is a lot}} more salt in an equivalent volume of sel gris.|$|R
5|$|<b>Kosher</b> <b>salt,</b> though refined, {{contains}} no iodine {{and has a}} much larger grain size than most refined salts.

5000|$|Vampiros {{may be made}} in a tall {{glass or}} an old {{fashioned}} glass. Bartenders may first [...] "rim" [...] the glass with <b>Kosher</b> <b>Salt,</b> which is done by placing a layer of <b>Kosher</b> <b>Salt</b> on a chopping board, moistening the glass' rim with lime juice or water, and then placing the upside down glass rim onto the <b>Kosher</b> <b>Salt,</b> so that the salt sticks to the moistened rim. The second step is to fill half the glass with ice and add one or two shooter glasses full of high quality Tequila. The next stage is to add the flavouring elements. This is done by squeezing a fresh lime into the glass, adding a few grains of salt, adding citrus-flavoured soda pop, until the glass is 4/5 full, and then adding spicy Viuda de Sanchez (or orange juice, lime juice and pico de gallo). The final step is to stir the ingredients so that the flavours are properly blended.|$|R
50|$|Focaccia al rosmarino is {{a popular}} style of flatbread in Italian cuisine {{prepared}} using focaccia dough, rosemary, olive oil <b>and</b> <b>salt,</b> sea <b>salt</b> or <b>kosher</b> <b>salt.</b> Focaccia al rosmarino may be served as antipasto (appetizer), table bread or snack.

50|$|In {{consumer}} marketing, it {{is difficult}} to find examples of undifferentiated approaches. Even goods such as <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> sugar, which were once treated as commodities, are now highly differentiated. Consumers can purchase a variety of salt products; cooking salt, table salt, sea-salt, rock <b>salt,</b> <b>kosher</b> <b>salt,</b> mineral salt, herbal or vegetable salts, iodized <b>salt,</b> <b>salt</b> substitutes <b>and</b> many more. Sugar also comes in many different types - cane sugar, beet sugar, raw sugar, white refined sugar, brown sugar, caster sugar, sugar lumps, icing sugar (also known as milled sugar), sugar syrup, invert sugar and a plethora of sugar substitutes including smart sugar which is essentially a blend of pure sugar and a sugar substitute. Each of these product types is designed {{to meet the needs of}} specific market segments. Invert sugar and sugar syrups, for example, are marketed to food manufacturers where they are used in the production of conserves, chocolate and baked goods. Sugars marketed to consumers appeal to different usage segments - refined sugar is primarily for use on the table, while caster sugar and icing sugar are primarily designed for use in home-baked goods.|$|R

50|$|The {{traditional}} use of <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> is {{for removing}} surface blood from meat by desiccation, {{as part of}} the koshering process for meat. The meat is soaked in cool water, drained, covered with a thin layer of salt, then allowed to stand on a rack or board for an hour. The salt remains {{on the surface of the}} meat, for the most part undissolved, and absorbs fluids from the meat. The salt grains are then washed off and discarded, carrying away the fluids absorbed. Compare this process to full desiccation of meat, which yields salt-cured meat.|$|R
5|$|The word kosher is {{also part}} of some common product names. Sometimes it is used as an {{abbreviation}} of koshering, meaning the process for making something kosher; for example, <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> is a form of salt with irregularly shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to the rules of kashrut, because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more effectively. At other times it is used as a synonym for Jewish tradition; for example, a kosher dill pickle is simply a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, using a generous addition of garlic to the brine, and is not necessarily compliant with the traditional Jewish food laws.|$|R
50|$|Korean sea salt, with {{a larger}} grain size and lower sodium content {{compared}} to common <b>kosher</b> <b>salt,</b> {{is used for the}} initial salting of napa cabbages. Being minimally processed, it serves to help developing flavors in fermented foods. Per 100 g water, around 2 g of salt is used. Half of the salt is dissolved in water before putting the cabbages in, and the other half is sprinkled in between the layers of napa cabbages that were washed, trimmed, and halved or quartered lengthwise. The cabbages are salted in the brine for several hours, turned over, then salted for more hours. After that, salted cabbages are washed thoroughly under running water and drained.|$|R

2500|$|To {{comply with}} this prohibition, {{a number of}} {{preparation}} techniques became practiced within traditional Judaism. The main technique, known as melihah, involves the meat being soaked in water for about half an hour, which opens pores. After this, the meat is placed on a slanted board or in a wicker basket, and is thickly covered with salt on each side, then left for between 20 minutes and one hour. The salt covering draws blood from the meat by osmosis, <b>and</b> the <b>salt</b> must be subsequently removed from the meat (usually by trying to shake most of it off and then washing the meat twice) to complete the extraction of the blood. [...] The type of salt used in the process is known as <b>kosher</b> <b>salt.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{some cases}} the causes of an {{infection}} or disease will be obvious (such as fin rot), though in other cases it {{may be due to}} water conditions, requiring special testing equipment and chemicals to appropriately adjust the water. Isolating diseased fish can help prevent the spread of infection to healthy fish in the tank. This also allows the use of chemicals or drugs which may damage the nitrogen cycle, plants or chemical filtration of a properly-functioning tank. Other alternatives include short baths in a bucket that contains the treated water. Salt baths can be used as an antiseptic and fungicide, and will not damaging beneficial bacteria, though ordinary table salt may contain additives which can harm fish. Alternatives include aquarium <b>salt,</b> <b>Kosher</b> <b>salt</b> or rock salt. Gradually raising the temperature of the tank may kill certain parasites, though some diseased fish may be harmed and certain species can not tolerate high temperatures. Aeration is necessary since less oxygen is dissolved in warm water.|$|R
