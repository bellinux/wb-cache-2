40|$|This thesis focusses on {{broadband}} vibration isolation, with {{an emphasis}} on control of absolute payload motion for ultra-precision instruments such as the MIT/Caltech Laser-Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), which is designed to measure spatial strains on the order of 10 -²¹. We develop novel passive elements and control strategies as well as a framework for concurrent design of the passive and active elements of single-stage and multi-stage isolation systems. In many applications, it is difficult to construct passive isolation systems compliant enough to achieve specifications on low-frequency <b>ground</b> <b>transmission</b> without introducing hysteresis as well as high-frequency transmission resonances. We develop and test a compliant support that employs a post-buckled structure in con- junction with a compliant spring to attain a low-frequency, low-static-sag mount in a compact package with a large range of travel and very clean dynamics. Most passive damping techniques increase <b>ground</b> <b>transmission</b> at high frequency, but tuned-mass dampers are decoupled from the ground. We explore the tuned-mass damper as a passive realization of the skyhook damper, obtain the optimal designs for multiple-SDOF systems of dampers, propose the concept of a multi-DOF damper, and show that MDOF dampers that couple translational and rotational motion have the potential to provide performance many times better than that traditional tuned-mass dampers. Active control can be used to improve low-frequency performance, but high-gain control can amplify sensor and actuator noise or cause instability. We study several control strategies for uncertain plants with high-order dynamics. (cont.) In particular, we develop a novel control strategy, "model-reaching" adaptive control, that drives the system onto a dynamic manifold defined directly in terms of the states of the target. The method can be used to robustly increase the apparent compliance of an isolation mount and maintain a - 40 dB/decade roll-off above the resulting corner frequency. by Lei Zuo. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|We show that, {{on general}} {{theoretical}} <b>grounds,</b> <b>transmission</b> {{of light in}} graphene always presents a non-vanishing minimum value independently of any material and physical condition, the transmission coefficient being higher {{in the presence of}} a substrate, and getting increasing when QED corrections higher than alpha come into play. Explicit numerical calculations for typical cases are carried out when an external magnetic field is applied to the sample, showing that, in epitaxial graphene, a threshold effect exists leading to a non trivial minimum transmission, for a non vanishing light frequency, only for field values larger than a critical one, both in the large and in the intermediate chemical potential regime. Such a threshold effect manifests even in the maximum Faraday rotation polarization of light, which is substantially controlled by the applied magnetic field. Instead, more transmission minima in suspended graphene enters in the considered light frequency region for increasing magnetic field, displaying an effective shift of frequency bands where the sample gets more or less absorptive with a suitable tuning of the external field. Two transition regions in different magnetic field ranges are found, where the shift effect towards higher frequency values occurs both in the transmission coefficient and in the Faraday rotation angle. Potential technological application of the results presented are envisaged. Comment: RevTeX, 6 pages, 6 composite figures; to be published in Materials Research Expres...|$|R
