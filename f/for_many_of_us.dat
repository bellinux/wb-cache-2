That's better than watching the country we're in being flattened by a storm. He also wrote:Look; I'm sorry Nelson Mandela is dead. It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen the sadness <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> I never met the man but, on balance, I {{came to the conclusion that}} he was a force for good rather than ill.

In 2001, The Guardian Gareth McLean stated that while she has avoided being typecast, Raquel [...] "may be the role for which she is best known". Fellow Guardian writer Paul Flynn {{observed}} in 2004 that Lancashire is [...] "assured {{her place in the}} national psyche" [...] because of Raquel, and when Lancashire starred in the 2009 BBC drama All the Small Things, The Guardian Lucy Mangan noted that she is [...] "still <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> trailing clouds of the glorious Raquel Wolstenhulme". In 2011, Raquel's wedding to Curly was placed eighteenth in Channel 5's [...] "Greatest TV Weddings" [...] programme.

Ian Hyland opined that Raquel, Curly and Des' storyline was a [...] "classic television love triangle".|$|E

2500|$|An earlier 1963 {{study by}} the poet James Radcliffe Squires spoke to the {{distinction}} of Frost as a poet whose verse soars more for the difficulty and skill by which he attains his final visions, than for the philosophical purity of the visions themselves. [...] "'He has written {{at a time when}} the choice for the poet seemed to lie among the forms of despair: Science, solipsism, or the religion of the past century…Frost has refused all of these and in the refusal has long seemed less dramatically committed than others…But no, he must be seen as dramatically uncommitted to the single solution…Insofar as Frost allows to both fact and intuition a bright kingdom, he speaks <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> [...] Insofar as he speaks through an amalgam of senses and sure experience so that his poetry seems a nostalgic memory with overtones touching some conceivable future, he speaks better than most of us.

It was absolutely no big deal. I mean, you didn't smoke it because your parents would strangle you.

2500|$|As a {{literary}} movement, McOndo then included like ideologies {{of literature and}} technique with which to communicate {{the experience of being}} Latin American in McOndo. Yet, the McOndos are quasi-apolitical, unlike the mid–20th-century Magical Realist novelists, for whom political discourse was the raison d’être of being a public intellectual. Nevertheless, the 21st-century modernity of McOndo orients it away from utopian [...] Left-wing ideology (national identity, imperialism, colonialism, et cetera) to the politics of the 20th century, which include [...] "a global, mixed, diverse, urban, twenty-first-century-Latin America, bursting on TV; and apparent in music, art, fashion, film, and journalism; hectic and unmanageable." [...] In the 21st century, contemporary Latin America is an historico–cultural hybrid of the 19th and the 21st centuries (cf. the dictator novel and the banana republic). In the event, the writers of the McOndo (1996) short-story anthology took discrete literary paths; Alberto Fuguet noted that [...] "divergence, for certain, was expected, for McOndo was not a deal, nor a treaty, nor a sect." [...] Later, some McOndos reneged their literary militancy against Magical Realism; Edmundo Paz Soldán observed that [...] "today, it is very clear, <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> that it is naïve to renounce such a wonderful tradition of political engagement {{on the part of the}} Latin American writer".|$|E

But indeed, the teaching of God Bogey is an outrage upon the soul of a child scarcely less dreadful than an indecent assault. The reason rebels and is crushed under this horrible and pursuing suggestion. Many minds never rise again from their injury.

Mr. Cluyme was so charmed at the facility with which Eliphalet recounted {{the rise and fall of}} sugar and cotton and wheat that he invited Mr. Hopper to dinner. And from this meal may be reckoned the first appearance of the family of which Eliphalet Hopper was the head into polite society. If the Cluyme household was not polite, it was nothing. Eliphalet sat next to Miss Belle, and heard the private history of many old families, which he cherished for future use. Mrs. Cluyme apologized for the dinner, which (if the truth were told) needed an apology. All of which is significant, but sordid and uninteresting. Jacob Cluyme usually bought stocks before a rise.|$|E

It is important to understand the factors influencing affective attitudes (i.e., preference and willingness to coexist, in this study) toward wild animals to design effective educational programs that will enhance such attitudes.|$|R
