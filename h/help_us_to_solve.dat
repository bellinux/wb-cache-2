40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a normalization {{tool for the}} ł-calculus with sum types, based on the technique of normalization by evaluation, and more precisely techniques developed by Olivier Danvy for partial evaluation, using control operators. The main characteristic of this work is that it produces a result in a canonical form. That is to say: two beta-eta-equivalent terms will be normalized into (almost) identical terms. It {{was not the case}} with the usual algorithm, which could even lead to an explosion of the size of code. This canonical form is an eta-long beta-normal form with constraints, which captures the definition of eta-long normal form for the lambda-calculus without sums, and reduces drastically the -conversion possibilities for sums.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} modelling {{and control}} of typical open systems: one is electroactive polymer gel and another is spinal nervous system. It is very im-portant to estimate the model based on their mechanisms in order to navigate the subjects into objective states. Firstly, the wave-shape pattern control method was proposed based on the gel model. Wave-shaped gels with varying curvature were obtained by switching the polarity of a spatially uniform electric field. Secondly, time series of images which represent distribution of somatic information inside the spinal cord were successfully obtained through measurement and computation utilizing somatotopic organization model of the spinal cord. The general problem underlying these studies is the degrees-of-freedom problem.

We introduced blindly an Arndt blocker 9 Fr inside the tracheal lumen of DLT until the orifice of the right upper lobe bronchus, the distance was checked before.

Researchers have begun to investigate the integrated optimization problem of preventive maintenance (PM) and production scheduling with a single objective.

40|$|In {{the present}} work we analyze the {{algorithm}} that {{was introduced in}} [4]. The algorithm performs a translation of a conceptual schema to an XML schema expressed in the XML Schema language.

Also, we introduce a concept of a translation profiling. The concept {{is based on a}} configuration that contains a set of parameters. We modify the algorithm to use the user requirements specified in the configuration. Thanks to the improvements, the new algorithm works with the concept of XML Namespaces, uses XML Schema designs and also, focuses on an elimination of redundancy.

40|$|Human {{beings are}} {{inquisitive}} creatures who seek explanations {{for all that}} they observe and experience in their living environment. While this quest for understanding is central to our success in adapting to a changing environment, {{it is also a}} major cause of our willingness to accept partial understandings and superficial explanations when the degree of complexity of the problem situation confounds our current cognitive capabilities. In other words, a superficial or partial explanation is considered better than no explanation at all.

Unfortunately, now we have to contend with another characteristic of human beings, our inherent resistance to change and aversion to risk taking. Once we have found an apparently reasonable and workable explanation or solution we tend to lose interest in pursuing its intrinsic shortcomings and increasingly believe in its validity.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the crystal-structure {{deduction}} of new structural types of Bi 3 +-M 2 + oxyphosphates (M is a transition element) from HREM images. Previous studies showed the unequivocal attribution of particular HREM contrasts to the corresponding Bi/M/O-based polycationic species in similar materials. On this basis, the examination of isolated crystallites of polyphased samples led to new HREM contrasts assigned to new polycationic species in three new structural types. This <b>helped</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> one crystal structure, and the two other forms have been deduced through HREM image decoding. It helped to model the investigated materials from the structural point of view {{as well as the}} chemical one. The three assumed crystal structures are formed by polycationic ribbons, n tetrahedra wide, surrounded by PO 4 groups, as already encountered in these series of oxyphosphates. However, here we deal with the original n= 4 - 6 cases, whereas, up to this work, only the n= 1 - 3 ribbons have been reported. The greater size of ribbons is associated with particular structural modifications responsible for complex HREM contrasts. The validity of the proposed models is verified in Part 2 of this work...|$|R
40|$|Our {{endeavour}} {{to build}} soluble model compounds of basic building blocks in zeolite structures {{have resulted in}} a plethora of main group and transition metal phosphate complexes. Many of these complexes show highly intriguing and novel structural features. Careful examination of the core structures allowed us to rationalize the interdependence between the different structural types and visualize their plausible pathway of formation. Due to the high reactivity and short life span of the intermediates it has not been possible to characterize many intermediates. However, the common structural features present in the isolated products drive us to arrive at a plausible mechanism. Further investigation and isolation of other structural types will definitely provide more credential to these hypotheses and <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> the zeolite jigsaw.

In this paper the symbolic part of the corporate culture of the modern organizations has been analyzed.

Corporate culture is characterized as a set of behavioral norms, artifacts, values, ideas and concepts, which are created by the organization.
