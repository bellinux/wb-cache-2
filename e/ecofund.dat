He was the chief {{architect}} and principal author of the Commission's world-acclaimed report Our Common Future, which {{was presented to the}} UN General Assembly in 1987. Setting out a new global agenda for sustainable development, the report recommended what became the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio (the Earth Summit). From 1989 to 1992, he acted as a Special Advisor to the Secretary General of the Conference, Maurice Strong. He also established and chaired the <b>EcoFund,</b> which raised special funding for preparations of the Conference.|$|E
5000|$|Since Strong {{left the}} UN in 2005 {{following}} the scandal, {{there appears to}} be little linking the two men. However Jim MacNeill's relationship with Maurice Strong is well-documented before then - their shared background includes activities ranging from sharing high-profile awards, to sitting on the Board of Directors of the same non-profit corporation to transferring million of dollars of charity money raised by MacNeill in the US to an organization created by Strong in Canada. Strong is credited in assisting with the creation and submission of the 1987 Brundtland Report (called [...] "Our Common Future") that would be presented to the UN General Assembly and become the basis for the 1992 Earth Summit. In 1992 when Maurice Strong launched the Earth Council Foundation (now the Earth Council Alliance) from his position as Secretary General of the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development, Jim MacNeill had a seat on the first Board of Directors. An independent auditor's report for the Earth Council Foundation's operations ending in October 31, 1993 revealed that a charity based in the United States and run by MacNeill called <b>EcoFund</b> '92 (now called Earth Council Foundation U.S.) had sent $1.3 million of its own funds to Maurice Strong's Earth Council Foundation in Canada, which is not a charity but a non-profit corporation. In 2002, the two were the sole recipients of the United Nations Candlelight Award, which was presented to them personally by Kofi Annan.|$|E
40|$|Total {{environmental}} expenditure in Bulgaria and {{the share}} of the public sector is analysed and compared with the necessary investments for compliance with the EU environmental standards. The main problems in the management of public financial resources for environmental management are identified {{on the basis of the}} analysis of main financing sources (the state budget, earmarked funds - the National Environmental Protection Fund and the National Trust <b>Ecofund,</b> environmental charges, international assistance, incl. ISPA programme). The legal framework of the newly established Enterprise for Environmental Activities Management is compared with the good practices of public environmental expenditure management in transition economies. Areas for improving the management of public financial resources are outlined: continuing the capacity building of environmental institutions; consolidation of state budget resources; combination of public and private financial resources; broad public participation in decision-making and improving the implementation of existing environmental charges and non-compliance fees. ...|$|E
40|$|Debt swaps as an {{instrument}} of international co-operation in environmental field were conceived and first applied in the 1980 s. They were once thought of as "win-win" arrangements solving environmental and economic problems at the same time. In the 1990 s it became clear, however, that (1) debt-for-environment swaps attracted as little as 1 - 2 percent of debt swap schemes (with debt-for-equity swaps taking almost all the rest), and (2) the effectiveness and efficiency of those carried out was sometimes problematic. The paper addresses the question of why [...] despite high expectations [...] debt-for-environment swaps have not emerged as a major international environmental policy tool. A debt swap is defined as a game. Its players include not only a creditor and a debtor governments (typically represented by finance ministers), but also a number of other stakeholders such as producers of abatement equipment, environmental agencies, and environmental NGOs. Cross-border coalitions may compound the pattern of conflict and co-operation. Issue linkage has been observed too. Specific design of a swap, comprising project selection and procurement rules among other things, determines whose interests are directly served by its mechanism, whose are left to the market forces, and whose are not served at all. Thus alternative design features, discussed in the paper, are reflected in payoffs from the game. The analytical model developed is applied to the Polish debt swap negotiated with the Paris Club in 1991. Under the agreement on the official debt forgiveness (50 percent) and rescheduling, Poland has been authorised to negotiate additional swaps (up to 10 percent) in a series of bilateral and voluntary deals with creditor countries. The government decided to: (1) seek debt-for-environment swaps only, and (2) co-ordinate all the bilateral contracts through a multilateral facility, the <b>EcoFund,</b> operated by the contributing creditor countries and Poland on a "club basis". Even though the <b>EcoFund</b> proved successful in its role serving global environmental protection and creditors' commercial interests, its development has been slow. Two countries took advantage of the full 10 percent swap option, three more participate with lower contributions and few others are still considering their membership in the "club". By referring to the game theoretic model developed, the author offers interpretations of this process...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{offsetting}} provides one {{avenue for}} local councils to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions. This includes voluntary offsetting of council events or activities and purchasing carbon credits to offset emissions from transport, or landfill sites exceeding 25, 000 tCO 2 -e. Offsets are 'An {{investment in a}} project that reduces greenhouse gas emissions or sequesters carbon from the atmosphere' to compensate for emissions from other activities (LGAQ, 2009 : 58). Under the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011, local councils can also earn carbon credits through managing landfill emissions, or environmental plantings. This paper evaluates carbon offsetting actions and motives by Queensland councils from a 2012 quantitative and qualitative survey sent to all 73 councils. Some 32 councils completed the survey with {{a response rate of}} 51 % (excluding Aboriginal shires). Seventeen Queensland councils stated offsetting was not necessary nor a priority, due to their small size, or were unsure about offset guidelines. However, five city councils and two coastal regional councils were partially offsetting emissions mainly from vehicle fuel and electricity, or community events. Councils with a climate change strategy, aiming to be carbon neutral (i. e. Cairns, Gold Coast, Redland, Sunshine Coast), were most likely to offset. The preferred offset action by councils was tree planting on council land or in partnership with conservation groups or offset companies (<b>Ecofund</b> Queensland, Greening Australia, & Greenfleet). Four councils wanted to sell/earn carbon credits, or support local landholders. The key motives for carbon offsetting included: council concern about climate impacts; supporting conservation; being climate friendly; and financially supporting offset projects. Councils preferred carbon offset methods such as tree planting or renewable energy with tangible environmental and financial benefits. ...|$|E
