60|$|The {{evening before}} they started who should bustle into the house but Everett himself. It was then about six o'clock, {{and he was going}} to leave London by the night mail. That he should be a little given to bustle on such an {{occasion}} may perhaps be forgiven him. He had heard the news down on the Scotch coast, and had flown up to London, telegraphing as he did so backwards and forwards to Wharton. Of course he felt that the destruction of his cousin among the glaciers,--whether by brandy or ice he did not much care,--had made him for the nonce one of the important people of the world. The young man who would not so feel might be the better philosopher, but one might doubt whether he would be the better young man. He quite agreed with his father that it was his sister's duty to go to Wharton, and he was now in a position to speak with authority as to the <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> of his family. He could not wait, even for one night, in order that he might travel with them. Sir Alured was impatient. Sir Alured wanted him in Herefordshire. Sir Alured had said that on such an occasion he, the heir, ought to be on the property with the shortest possible delay. His father smiled;--but with an approving smile. Everett therefore started by the night mail, leaving his father and sister to follow him on the morrow.|$|E

5000|$|Established in November 1945, the North Korean Democratic Women's League {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{organized}} groups to rally behind the leadership of Kim Il-sung and the NKPPC with the intent of upholding democracy, eliminating fascists and national traitors, building a strong and wealthy government, and working to overthrow feudal customs and superstitions. The Women's League worked to effect new laws regarding women and bring women more actively into political and social life, including Local People's Committee elections. By April 1949, membership had swelled significantly and every village contained roughly 5,500 members with 112 local groups. Some of the earliest projects the Women's League took on were educating women and families to enroll their children in school. Among some of the <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> of the Women's league included engaging in economic planning, agricultural production, and various lectures and concerts for women. Some of these activities often replicated the traditional roles of women as women were often the ones expected to conserve rice in the home and mobilize for the donation of [...] "patriotic rice." [...] However, some women criticized the conservatism of the League because the League's program continued to pigeonhole women into the traditional roles of caregivers. Other criticisms centered on female leadership in the Women's League, which was largely held by elite wives married to high ranking party officials, school teachers, and housewives, instead of working class women.|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is the <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> of a Limited Liability Company. Recently {{experienced}} legislation about legal relationships of a Limited Liability Company many changes related to the new recodification of private law, made by the Act no. 89 / 2012 Coll, Civil Code, and by the Act no. 90 / 2012 Coll., Business Corporations Act.

The most significant changes that directly affected the <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> of a Limited Liability Company, are minimization of the amount of capital, pushing deposit and liability duties in the background, incorporation of the loyalty to the law, the possibility of acquisition of shares by the company, the possibility of creating more types of shares, the possibility of acquiring a stake in the company from non-owner and many others.

40|$|Summary: The {{theme of}} this thesis, I chose to follow in my dissertation, in which I dealth with general rights and <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> of limited {{liability}} company. One of the main <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> {{in this type of}} company is to provide the contribution to the registered capital of the company. During the studying this issue my attention has been caught by a relatively visible and discussed change of the minimal contribution to the registered capital, which is included in a new Commercial Code. This change relates to discussions about the capital of limited liability company and a diversion from its guarantee function. New Commercial Code preserves and let me say than even more supports the nature of a limited liability company, how it is considered by legislators, as a form of the company which has the minimum of regulations and is formed when the undertaking due to trade Act is not sufficient. It's cheap and simple foundation should help the company to succeed in the competitions of law regulations. Although otherwise the Czech legislators tries to deliberate the prudent implementation of European law, the reduction of the contribution obligation and a diversion from the protective function of the registered capital of limited liability company is in line with modern tendencies in other European [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Limited Liability Company is {{so popular}} form of a {{corporation}} suitable. I can say, this type of company {{is the most popular}} form of business organization. To have some knowledge about this issue could be very helpful and that is a reason of choosing this topic of my thesis. The regulation of <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> of a limited liability company in the Commercial Code is only a little part of the whole limited liability company, but very I think, it is very important part. The regulation of duties members of a limited liability company is complex with their right and often should be view together. But on the other hand, sometimes the text of Commercial Code says nothing about the particular position of the member in the company and must be used theory. The most important of my thesis is to focus on the main <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> of a limited liability company and the position of them. Every each duty of members I described in a separate chapter. I tried to explain every one duty in relation with other duties to explain mutual interconnection as a complex unit. The legal regulation of the Limited Liability Company should be often so much formal and complicated. At the end of my thesis I get special section for new regulation of business law because present Commercial Code is to be replaced by the new one Code [...] ...|$|E

The subject of the dissertation is research of the nature, origin, and function, of the duty of loyalty. The conclusion of the dissertation is the confirmation of the hypothesis, that the duty of loyalty by which a member of the board of directors is bound, is a fiduciary duty and an independent duty, which is not a part of the duty to act with due managerial care...|$|E
