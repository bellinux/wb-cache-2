Therefore, uranium was positioned below tungsten in group VI, and thorium below zirconium in group IV, leaving the space below tantalum in <b>group</b> <b>V</b> empty and, until the 1950s, periodic tables were published with this structure. For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible. Tantalum's heavier analogue was later found to be the transuranic element dubnium.|$|E

She departed the United Kingdom for the Mediterranean Sea in June 1943, and in early July 1943 joined Escort Force S at Algiers in Algeria. Escort Force S departed Algiers on 5 July 1943 escorting the military convoy KMS 18 bound for Sicily, but Viceroy had to detach from the convoy on 9 July 1943 for a quick repair at Malta. It was completed in time for her to depart Malta on 10 July and arrive off the Sicily invasion beaches on 11 July 1943, the day after the initial landings, where she joined Escort <b>Group</b> <b>V</b> to defend the anchorage off the beachhead, conduct patrols, and escort convoys. She continued to support Operation Husky until September 1943, when she returned to the United Kingdom to resume patrol and convoy escort operations in the North Sea.

25|$|While {{there are}} many types of PV systems known to be effective, {{crystalline}} silicon PV accounted for around 90% of the worldwide production of PV in 2013. Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of Boron, a group III element, are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a <b>group</b> <b>V</b> element, which creates an N-type semiconducting surface. To reduce energy losses an anti-reflective coating {{is added to the}} surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} oral Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{on the success of}} eradication therapy against gastric H. pylori. METHODS: A total of 391 patients with dyspepsia were examined for H. pylori using the saliva H. pylori antigen test (HPS), 13 C-urea breath test (UBT), gastroscopy, and gastric mucosal histopathological detection. Another 40 volunteers without discomfort were subjected to HPS and 13 C-UBT, and served as the control group. The 233 patients who were 13 C-UBT+ were enrolled in this study and divided into 4 groups. Patients who were HPS- and 13 C-UBT+ (n = 53) received triple therapy alone. Those who were both HPS+ and 13 C-UBT+ (n = 180) were randomly divided into 3 groups: (1) the O+G+t group which received triple therapy alone (n = 53); (2) the O+G+tm group which received both triple therapy and mouthrinse treatment (n = 65); and (3) the O+G+tmp group which received triple therapy, mouthrinse, and periodontal treatment (n = 62). The HPS and 13 C-UBT were continued for 4 wk after completion of treatment, and the eradication rate of gastric H. pylori and the prevalence of oral H. pylori in the 4 groups were then compared. RESULTS: The eradication rates of gastric H. pylori in the O-G+t group, the O+G+tm group, and the O+G+tmp group were 93. 3 %, 90. 0 %, and 94. 7 % respectively; all of these rates were higher than that of the O+G+t group (78. 4 %) [O-G+t <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O+G+t <b>group</b> (P = 0. 039); O+G+tm <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O+G+t <b>group</b> (P = 0. 092); O+G+tmp <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O+G+t <b>group</b> (P = 0. 012); O+G+tm <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O-G+t <b>group</b> (P = 0. 546); O+G+tmp <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O-G+t <b>group</b> (P = 0. 765); O+G+tm <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O+G+tmp <b>group</b> (P = 0. 924) ]. The eradication of gastric H. pylori was significantly improved using the combination of triple therapy, mouthrinse, and periodontal treatment. The eradication rates of gastric H. pylori in the peptic ulcer group, chronic atrophic gastritis group and control group were higher than in the duodenitis group and the superficial gastritis group. The prevalence rates of oral H. pylori in the O-G+t group, O+G+t group, O+G+tm group and O+G+tmp group following treatment were 0 %, 76. 5 %, 53. 3 %, and 50. 9 %, respectively [O-G+t <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O+G+t <b>group</b> (P < 0. 0001); O+G+tm <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O+G+t <b>group</b> (P = 0. 011); O+G+tmp <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O+G+t <b>group</b> (P = 0. 006); O+G+tm <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O-G+t <b>group</b> (P < 0. 0001); O+G+tmp <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O-G+t <b>group</b> (P < 0. 0001); O+G+tm <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> the O+G+tmp <b>group</b> (P = 0. 790) ].

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{antibacterial}} {{effect of}} ozone (O 3) {{has been described}} in the extant literature, but the role of O 3 therapy {{in the treatment of}} certain types of infection remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of intraperitoneal (i. p.) O 3 application in a cecal ligation/puncture rat model on interleukins (IL- 6, IL- 10) and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) - 1 serum levels, acute lung injury and survival rates. METHODS: Four animal groups were used for the study: a) the SHAM group underwent laparotomy; b) the cecal ligation/puncture group underwent cecal ligation/puncture procedures; and c) the CLP+O 2 and CLP+O 3 groups underwent CLP+ corresponding gas mixture infusions (i. p.) throughout the observation period. IL- 6, CINC- 1 and IL- 10 concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Acute lung injury was evaluated with the Evans blue dye lung leakage method and by lung histology. P< 0. 05 was considered significant. RESULTS: CINC- 1 was at the lowest level in the SHAM group and was lower for the CLP+O 3 <b>group</b> <b>vs.</b> the CLP+O 2 group and the cecal ligation/puncture group. IL- 10 was lower for the SHAM <b>group</b> <b>vs.</b> the other three groups, which were similar compared to each other. IL- 6 was lower for the SHAM <b>group</b> <b>vs.</b> all other <b>groups,</b> was lower for the CLP+O 3 or CLP+O 2 <b>group</b> <b>vs.</b> the cecal ligation/puncture group, and was similar for the CLP+O 3 <b>group</b> <b>vs.</b> the CLP+O 2 group.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{features}} of biochemical metabolic changes detected by hepatic phosphorus- 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31 P MRS) with the liver damage score (LDS) and pathologic changes in rabbits and to investigate the diagnostic value of 31 P MRS in acute hepatic radiation injury. METHODS: A total of 30 rabbits received different radiation doses (ranging 5 - 20 Gy) to establish acute hepatic injury models. Blood biochemical tests, 31 P MRS and pathological examinations were carried out 24 h after irradiation. The degree of injury was evaluated according to LDS and pathology. Ten healthy rabbits served as controls. The MR examination was performed on a 1. 5 T imager using a 1 H/ 31 P surface coil by the 2 D chemical shift imaging technique. The relative quantities of phosphomonoesters (PME), phosphodiesters (PDE), inorganic phosphate (Pi) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were measured. The data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: (1) Relative quantification of phosphorus metabolites: (a) ATP: {{there were significant differences}} (P < 0. 05) (LDS-groups: control <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> mild <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> moderate <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> severe <b>group,</b> 1. 83 ± 0. 33 vs 1. 55 ± 0. 24 vs 1. 27 ± 0. 09 vs 0. 98 ± 0. 18; pathological groups: control <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> mild <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> moderate <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> severe <b>group,</b> 1. 83 ± 0. 33 vs 1. 58 ± 0. 25 vs 1. 32 ± 0. 07 vs 1. 02 ± 0. 18) of ATP relative quantification among control group, mild injured group, moderate injured group, and severe injured group according to both LDS grading and pathological grading, respectively, and it decreased progressively with the increased degree of injury (r = - 0. 723, P = 0. 000). (b) PME and Pi; the relative quantification of PME and Pi decreased significantly in the severe injured group, and the difference between the control group and severe injured group was significant (P < 0. 05) (PME: LDS-control <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> LDS-severe <b>group,</b> 0. 86 ± 0. 23 vs 0. 58 ± 0. 22, P = 0. 031; pathological control <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> pathological severe <b>group,</b> 0. 86 ± 0. 23 vs 0. 60 ± 0. 21, P = 0. 037; Pi: LDS-control <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> LDS-severe <b>group,</b> 0. 74 ± 0. 18 vs 0. 43 ± 0. 14, P = 0. 013; pathological control <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> pathological severe <b>group,</b> 0. 74 ± 0. 18 vs 0. 43 ± 0. 14, P = 0. 005) according to LDS grading and pathological grading, respectively. (c) PDE; {{there were no significant differences}} among groups according to LDS grading, and no significant differences between the control group and experimental groups according to pathological grading. (2) The ratio of relative quantification of phosphorus metabolites: significant differences (P < 0. 05) (LDS-moderate group and LDS-severe <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> LDS-control <b>group</b> and LDS-mild group, 1. 94 ± 0. 50 and 1. 96 ± 0. 72 vs 1. 43 ± 0. 31 and 1. 40 ± 0. 38) were only found in PDE/ATP between the moderate injured group, the severe injured group and the control group, the mild injured group. No significant difference was found in other ratios of relative quantification of phosphorus metabolites. CONCLUSION: 31 P MRS is a useful method to evaluate early acute hepatic radiation injury.
