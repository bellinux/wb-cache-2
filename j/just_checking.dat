5000|$|In March 2011, UCLA student Alexandra Wallace {{uploaded}} a YouTube video entitled [...] "UCLA Asians in the library", ranting {{about the}} [...] "hordes of Asians" [...] in UCLA who don't [...] "use American manners". In a rant about Asians speaking loudly on a cellphone in the campus library, she mimicked one as saying, [...] "Ohhh! Ching chong ling long ting tong? Ohhh!". The video went viral, {{resulting in the}} student receiving multiple death threats via e-mails and telephone calls.

[...] Over 40 percent of the school's 36,000 students are Asian American and Pacific Islanders.

The Sacramento Bee wrote, [...] "The students she mocked can inspire resentment, jealousy and fear—the kindling of ethnic slurs—because their success is about achievement and a pathway to status." [...] Additional responses included a line of T-shirts featuring the [...] "Ching-chong" [...] slur, with all proceeds going to Red Cross relief for the tsunami. UCLA deemed the video offensive and called it [...] "repugnant". The student later wrote to The Daily Bruin, issuing an apology to [...] "the entire UCLA campus". The New York Times published an editorial criticizing the video, but supporting her First Amendment right to free speech. Several days later, UCLA announced it would not discipline the student, but she withdrew from the university. AsianWeek wrote that [...] "any negatives student experienced are just a fraction of what Asian Americans have experienced since coming to America".|$|E
