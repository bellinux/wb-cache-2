25|$|The President of the Court of Justice {{is elected}} from {{and by the}} judges for a {{renewable}} term of three years. The president presides over hearings and deliberations, directing both judicial business and administration (for example, the time table of the Court and Grand Chamber). He also assigns cases to the chambers for examination and appoints judge as rapporteurs (reporting judges). The Council may also appoint assistant rapporteurs to assist the President in applications for <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> and to assist rapporteurs {{in the performance of}} their duties.|$|E
25|$|Because {{temperatures}} in flight had not dropped below the 777's designed operating parameters, the Air Accidents Investigations Branch (AAIB) recommended Boeing and Rolls-Royce take <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> on Trent 800-powered 777s {{to reduce the}} risk of ice restricting fuel delivery. Boeing did so by revising the 777 operating procedures so as to reduce the opportunities for such blockages to occur, and by changing the procedure to be followed in the event of power loss to take into account the possibility that ice accumulation was the cause.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} the {{potential}} for a substantial harm to occur that is permanent in nature, such as the execution of a death penalty or the deportation of a person who could face torture, then the author of the complaint can request that it be greeted with Urgency. Cases such as these are covered by Rule 86 of the Committee's Rules of Procedure. Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur on New Communications can issue 'interim measures' in order to prevent the harm occurring while the complaint is being considered. The Committee views any failure by the State to adhere by these <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> a breach of their obligations under the First Optional Protocol.|$|E

500|$|Until the 1960s, the New Jersey Senate had 21 representatives, {{one from}} each county {{regardless}} of population. In {{the wake of}} the 1964 decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in Reynolds v. Sims, establishing the one man, one vote principle that state legislative districts must be approximately equal in size, David Friedland filed suit in New Jersey Supreme Court on behalf of two union leaders, challenging a system under which each county was represented by a single member in the New Jersey Senate. The senate enacted a proposal whereby each senator's vote would be weighted based on the population of the county represented, [...] under which Cape May County's senator would receive one vote while the senator from Essex County would receive 19.1, in direct relation to the ratio of residents between counties. In a decision issued on December 15, 1964, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the weighted voting system as adopted was unconstitutional. The court ordered that <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> be established for the 1965 legislative elections, in which weighted voting {{could be used as a}} temporary measure, and that the needed constitutional changes to restructure the New Jersey Legislature to be in compliance with [...] "one man, one vote" [...] requirements be in place before elections took place in 1967. The legislature's final decision was to establish 40 districts statewide, each represented by one senator and two assemblymembers, without relation to county boundaries.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the RAF issued an Air Staff Requirement for the {{development}} of a new interceptor intended to replace both the Phantom and the Lightning. An early proposal was McDonnell Douglas's plan for a Phantom with a variable-geometry wing. This was rejected by the RAF owing to the fact that there was little apparent improvement in performance over the existing Phantom, and that it might affect the development of the [...] "Multi-Role Combat Aircraft" [...] (MRCA). Another idea that the MRCA concept, which eventually evolved into the Panavia Tornado, could be used in the interceptor role, was ruled out, as both its avionics and engines were optimised for low-level interdiction. The UK's partners in the MRCA project displayed no enthusiasm for the idea of developing an air defence version of the Tornado, so the UK alone began the process, and the authorisation for what came to be known as the Tornado ADV was issued in March 1976. The initial plan was for the Tornado to replace the remaining two squadrons of Lightnings, as well as all seven squadrons of Phantoms. While the Tornado was in development, the RAF looked at <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> to replace the Phantom, which had been in service for over a decade by 1980, and was beginning to suffer from fatigue; one proposal considered was the possibility of leasing or purchasing F-15 Eagles to re-equip 19 and 92 Squadrons, the units stationed in Germany. Further suggestions were that up to 80 F-15s be procured, to replace the Phantom and Lightning squadrons then in service, or even cancel the Tornado entirely and purchase the F-15 with UK adaptations (specifically to be fitted with the AI.24 Foxhunter radar developed for the Tornado, and capable of carrying the Skyflash air-to-air missile). Ultimately, the F-15 option was not seriously considered, as it was felt there would not be time or cost savings over the Tornado ADV. It was later decided that the Tornado, once it had entered service, would only re-equip three of the Phantom squadrons; two Phantom units would be retained in the UK, and two in Germany. Eventually, the Tornado accounted for the two FG.1 squadrons at RAF Leuchars (43 and 111 Squadrons), plus two FGR.2 units (23 Squadron and 29 Squadron), while 56 and 74 Squadrons continued with the Phantom.|$|E

[...] This means a farmer needs a licence from the Local Authority to move livestock.

2500|$|TEA {{promotes}} {{the use of}} thorium using a different rationale. Increasing world population, depleting resources [...] and global warming have put severe constraints on the choices of power generation available today. Traditional fossil fuel based energy generation faces two-fold challenges in terms of depleting resources and need to keep greenhouse gas emissions in control. While <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> like natural gas and unconventional oil are proposed, these still have a carbon footprint and are not universally available. Hydropower use has reached a natural limit {{in many parts of}} the world, and the existing capacity is under stress due to climate change. Renewable energy is seen as an important component of future energy generation, but being essentially intermittent, can not be effectively managed by the current power distribution technologies. [...] Hence, nuclear energy is seen as an important option for power generation in many countries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{maintenance}} headaches and catastrophic failures were the engines. Although the Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engines later became a trustworthy workhorse in large piston-engined aircraft, early models were beset with dangerous reliability problems.

Oil flow to the valves was also increased, asbestos baffles installed around rubber push rod fittings to prevent oil loss, thorough pre-flight inspections made to detect unseated valves, and frequent replacement of the uppermost five cylinders (every 25 hours of engine time) and the entire engines (every 75 hours).|$|E
