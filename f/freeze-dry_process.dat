50|$|Modern {{freeze-drying}} {{was developed}} during World War II. Blood serum {{being sent to}} Europe from the US for medical treatment of the wounded required refrigeration, {{but because of the}} lack of simultaneous refrigeration and transport, many serum supplies were spoiling before reaching their intended recipients. The freeze-drying process was developed as a commercial technique that enabled serum to be rendered chemically stable and viable without having to be refrigerated. Shortly thereafter, the <b>freeze-dry</b> <b>process</b> was applied to penicillin and bone, and lyophilization became recognized as an important technique for preservation of biologicals. Since that time, freeze-drying has been used as a preservation or processing technique for a wide variety of products. These applications include the following but are not limited to: the processing of food, pharmaceuticals, and diagnostic kits; the restoration of water damaged documents; the preparation of river-bottom sludge for hydrocarbon analysis; the manufacturing of ceramics used in the semiconductor industry; the production of synthetic skin; the manufacture of sulfur-coated vials; and the restoration of historic/reclaimed boat hulls.|$|E
40|$|Many {{pharmaceutical}} products are obtained via freeze-drying of liquid solutions to obtain stable long lasting preparations. The <b>freeze-dry</b> <b>process</b> produces porous cakes whose structure strongly {{depends on the}} freezing phase, so that monitoring and optimizing this phase can help both reducing the product cost and insuring its constant quality. Nowadays the optimization is usually performed by determining the cake mass transfer coefficient via a costly process in pilot plants, while the quality is assured only by controlling the process conditions. This paper describes an alternative way of approximately estimat-ing the mass transfer coefficient, {{which is based on}} the observation of the product structure by a simple electron microscope followed by a frequency domain imaging process. While the process has been designed and characterized specifically for {{pharmaceutical products}}, the proposed approach can be used in several other fields where the characteristics of porous material have to be monitored...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of biologically inert synthetic scaffolds {{to support the}} 3 D growth of human cells in vitro is essential in understanding the complex interactions between multiple cell types in tissue. A base 3 D tissue culture scaffold without endocrine or growth factor interference from the substrate is key to providing a controllable, biologically representative, in vitro experimental model. Here we describe the cross-linking of a water soluble protein resistant polymer based on poly(2 -alkyl- 2 -oxazoline) (PAOx), conjugated with cell binding peptides for use in human primary stromal cell 3 D culture in vitro. Using a temperature controlled crystallization and <b>freeze-dry</b> <b>process,</b> the induction of a porous network structure within pre-cured, cross-linked hydrogels allows for the addition, attachment and growth of both mouse and human stromal cell lines within the scaffolds. We further show that scaffolds conjugated with the cell binding motif arginine-glycineaspartic acid (RGD), support primary human cell attachment and growth. Morphological differences were observed by cells expanding across scaffold pores of the RGD conjugated scaffolds; while little adhesion was observed in scaffolds not containing RGD. The observed differences suggest a requirement for including RGD for PAOx based 3 D tissue culture scaffolding focusing on primary human stromal cells. PAOx scaffolds including RGD can therefore be used to generate 3 D primary human stroma {{for use as a}} reproducible in vitro human model...|$|E
40|$|With {{heart disease}} being {{the leading cause}} of death in the US and an {{estimated}} 1. 3 million heart attacks occurring annually, the need for tissue-engineered strategies to regenerate damaged cardiac tissue has become increasingly important. This thesis discusses the development of scaffold systems to examine the alignment and beating potential of HL- 1 cardiomyoctyes in a 3 D environment. Collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffolds have been used extensively to probe the behavior of mature cells in vitro, but have not yet been designed for cardiac applications. In order to recapitulate key properties of the cardiac extracellular matrix, most notably its high degree of organization and alignment, we fabricated scaffolds with a longitudinally anisotropic pore structure. A <b>freeze-dry</b> <b>process</b> promoting unidirectional heat transfer through the precursor suspension was employed to create scaffolds of various mean pore sizes, all with pores elongated in the direction of solidification. The effects of structural cues on cell number, metabolic activity, alignment, and beating potential were quantified. It was shown that scaffolds with longitudinally anisotropic pore structures promoted spontaneous HL- 1 cardiomyocyte beating compared to isotropic controls. This effect was dependent on pore size, with scaffolds with larger mean pore sizes exhibiting the highest instances of spontaneous beating. In addition, anisotropic scaffold variants promoted gross cell alignment in the longitudinal plane. These results indicate that an anisotropic collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffold with larger pores (> 150 ??m), may be most suited for cardiac tissue engineering applications...|$|E

40|$|Approximately 40 % of {{the drugs}} {{dissolve}} poorly in the gastro-intestinal tract after oral administration. If the drug is not dissolved, it can not enter the bloodstream and hence it is not effective. Possible consequences are that these drugs have to be administered in large doses and that food can have a strong effect {{on the amount of}} drug entering the bloodstream. Nanocrystals (crystals smaller than a millionth of a meter) can be used to increase the dissolution rate and thereby the effectivity of these drugs. In this research, a novel process to prepare these drug nanocrystals, ‘controlled crystallization during freeze-drying’, was developed. This process yields drug nanocrystals embedded in a fast dissolving sugar matrix. To optimize this novel process, the mechamism of nanoparticle formation during freeze-drying was elucidated by in-line Raman-spectroscopy. Furthermore, a novel microscopic method was developed to analyze the drug particles that were obtained after freeze-drying. This microscopic method could be used to determine the drug particle size, even though the drug was embedded in a matrix. To change the <b>freeze-drying</b> <b>process</b> into a spray <b>freeze-drying</b> <b>process,</b> the application of a 3 -way nozzle was tested.

40|$|Freeze drying is a complex, time {{consuming}} and thus expensive process, hence creating {{a need for}} understanding the material behaviour in the process environment and for process optimization. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy offers the opportunity to monitor physicochemical changes of the formulation during freeze-drying. The aim of this work was to examine whether NIR spectroscopy allows in-line monitoring of all components during the entire <b>freeze-drying</b> <b>process</b> of a multi-component pharmaceutical formulation (a solution of fenofibrate and mannitol {{in a mixture of}} tertiary-butyl alcohol, and water). To extract useful information of all components in the formulation from the large multivariate data-sets obtained during in-line spectroscopic monitoring, several spectral pre-processing techniques and spectral data analysis techniques such as the mean of selected wavenumbers (Mws), the correlation coefficient (CorrCoef) and principal component analysis (PCA) have been evaluated and compared. To find out whether these chemometric techniques are also able to differentiate between changes in the process settings influencing the <b>freeze-drying</b> <b>process</b> of the formulation, <b>freeze-drying</b> <b>processes</b> were performed at four different conditions. Results demonstrated that in-line measurements using NIR spectroscopy were possible in an icy environment and that a further process understanding could be obtained.

40|$|A new porous media {{mathematical}} model for freeze-drying was developed {{based on the}} adsorption-desorption relationship proposed in this paper. A finite difference solution was obtained from a moving boundary problem for the dielectric-material-assisted microwave <b>freeze-drying</b> <b>process.</b> Silicon carbide (SiC) {{was selected as the}} dielectric material; and frozen skim milk was used as the aqueous solution to be dried. Simulation results showed that the dielectric material can significantly enhance the microwave <b>freeze-drying</b> <b>process.</b> The drying time was 33. 1 % shorter than that of ordinary microwave freeze-drying under typical operating conditions. When the solid content of the solution to be freeze-dried was very low, or the solid product had a very small loss factor, microwave heating was less effective without the assistance of dielectric material. The mechanisms of heat and mass transfer during drying were analyzed based on profiles of ice saturation, temperature and vapor concentration. Drying rate-controlling factors were discussed.

Bovine pericardium tissue has been successfully used as a bioprosthetic material in manufacturing heart valves, but studies concerning the tissue are ongoing in order to improve its storage, preservation and transportation. This article provides an overview of the characteristics of bovine pericardium tissue chemically treated after the <b>freeze-drying</b> <b>process.</b> These characteristics are essential to evaluate the changes or damage to the tissue during the process. Methods: The mechanical properties of the tissue were analyzed by three different methods due to its anisotropic characteristics.

The combination of these four process analyzers to monitor a <b>freeze-drying</b> <b>process</b> is unique.

Furthermore and most important, the combined use of the process analyzers helped to identify flaws in previous studies in which these process analyzers were studied individually. Process analyzers might wrongly indicate that some process steps are fulfilled.
