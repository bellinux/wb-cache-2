It was a maximum traction, bogie, <b>drop</b> <b>end</b> and centre combination, built by Duncan & Fraser (1913). It became a C class tram for the MMTB. It brought to Ballarat in 1951 and renumbered as Tram 40. It completed 376,387 miles in Ballarat. This {{was the last}} tram to run on the Ballarat tramway network, and the first tram to operate on the Ballarat Tramway Museum tracks.|$|E
5000|$|Tram 63 {{was built}} in 1913 by Duncan & Fraser. This was an H class tram, single truck, <b>drop</b> <b>end,</b> closed combination. It was bought by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria for use on the Ballarat tramways in 1931 as Tram 18. When the tramway closed in 1971 {{it was given to}} the Borough of Sebastopol. It was the last tram to travel on the Ballarat network when it was towed along the tracks to a park in Sebastopol as a {{historic}} exhibit. It was recovered by the Ballarat Tramway Museum in 1982 and restored to operating condition.|$|E
50|$|The {{classification}} system was simplified in 1928. All the <b>drop</b> <b>end</b> combination trams: B, H, J, M and S classes {{were added to}} A class. The straight sill combination classes F, K, Q, and R, were added to G class. Maximum traction bogie combination classes D, E, N, and P, were added to C class. Sometimes variations on a design were given extra letters or numerals. For example, W class trams classified as W3 or CW5. Over the years many of the trams were modified and then reclassified. For example, all the W class trams were converted to W2 class between 1928 and 1933.|$|E

40|$|Disdrometer based {{hydrometeor}} {{size distribution}} measurements {{have a wide}} range of application in radar meteorology among other disciplines. The low-cost laser optical disdrometer which became commercially available in 2005 opened a new era to study the variability of the hydrometeor size distribution. The pixel and footprint scale variability of the ground and spaceborne radar remote sensing of precipitation, respectively, has been investigated through a network of Parsivel disdrometers. At the same timE, the cross comparison of impact-type, two-dimensional video and laser-optical disdrometers highlighted the relative strengths and weaknesses of each type of disdrometer. The Parsivel instrument tended to underestimate the number of small drops less than 0. 8 mm in diameter quite severely, while the size of drops larger than 2. 0 mm in diameter were overestimated at heavy rain quite frequently. Through a close collaboration with the manufacturer, these shortcomings were attributed to the inexpensive laser device. The manufacturer has just released a beta version of Parsivel 2. The preliminary comparisons with old and new versions of Parsivel, impact type disdrometer and rain gauges showed a noticeable improvement of the Parsivel at both small and large <b>drop</b> <b>end.</b> This presentation will demonstrate the evaluation of the new unit and its potential impact on radar rainfall relations, including polarimetric and high frequency radar rainfall...|$|E
40|$|Estimation of {{rainfall}} integral parameters, including radar observables, and empirical relations between them {{are sensitive to}} the truncation of the drop size distribution (DSD), particularly at the large <b>drop</b> <b>end.</b> The sensitivity {{of rainfall}} integral parameters to the maximum drop diameter (D(sub max)) is exacerbated at Cband since resonance effects are pronounced for large drops in excess of 5 mm diameter (D). Due to sampling limitations, {{it is often difficult to}} reliably estimate D(sub max) with disdrometers. The resulting uncertainties in D(sub max 0 potentially increase errors in radar retrieval methods, particularly at Cband, that rely on disdrometer observations for DSD input to radar models. In fact, D(sub max) is typically an assumed DSD parameter in the development of radar retrieval methods. Because of these very uncertainties, it is difficult to independently confirm disdrometer estimates of D(sub max) with polarimetric radar observations. A couple of approaches can be taken to reduce uncertainty in large drop measurement. Longer integration times can be used for the collection of larger disdrometer samples. However, integration periods must be consistent with a radar resolution volume (RRV) and the temporal and spatial scales of the physical processes affecting the DSD therein. Multiple colocated disdrometers can be combined into a network to increase the sample size within a RRV. However, over a reasonable integration period, a single disdrometer sample volume is many orders of magnitudes less than a RRV so it is not practical to devise a network of disdrometers that has an equivalent volume to a typical RRV. Since knowledge of DSD heterogeneity and large drop occurrence in time and space is lacking, the specific accuracy or even general representativeness of disdrometer based D(sub max) and large drop concentration estimates within a RRV are currently unknown. To address this complex issue, we begin with a simpler question. Is the frequency of occurrence of large rain drops (D > 5 mm) in disdrometer observations, either stand alone or networked, generally representative and consistent with polarimetric radar observations? We first show from simulations that the concentration of large (D > 5 mm) rain drops (N(sub T 5)) can be estimated from polarimetric observations of specific differential phase (K(sub dp)) and differential reflectivity (Z(sub dr)), N(sub T 5) =F(K(sub dp),Z(sub dr)), or horizontal reflectivity (Z(sub h)) and Z(sub dr), N(sub T 5) =(Z(sub h),Z(sub dr)). We assess the error associated with polarimetric retrieval of N(sub T 5), including sensitivity to D(sub max) parameterization assumptions and measurement error in the radar simulations. Polarimetric measurements at Sband and Cband will then be used to retrieve estimates of N(sub T 5) and compared to disdrometer estimates of N(sub T 5). After careful consideration of retrieval error, we will check consistency between disdrometer and polarimetric radar estimates of N(sub T 5) and the frequency of occurrence of large rain drops in a variety of precipitating regimes using data from NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Ground Validation (GV) program, including field campaigns such as MC 3 E (Oklahoma) and IFloodS (Iowa) and extended measurements over Huntsville, Alabama and NASA Wallops Flight Facility in coastal Virginia...|$|E
