40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the process of {{planning}} the costs of a contract for construction. The thesis describes the pricing, contract for construction, construction time models, and allocation of costs <b>during</b> the <b>construction.</b> It introduces a particular contract for construction, which is analysed mainly with regard to the allocation of costs <b>during</b> the <b>construction.</b> The thesis introduces also alternative solutions for the allocation of costs <b>during</b> the <b>construction.</b> The purpose of the thesis is to compare the alternative solutions with the reality, and analyse the allocation of costs <b>during</b> the <b>construction...</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>construction,</b> which {{occurred}} during World War II, {{there were several}} modifications, delays and accidents <b>during</b> <b>construction</b> to avoid the trains being finished before the war ended; this was to avoid the finished trains {{to be able to}} assist the German occupation forces. The first three units were finished in 1945, and delivery was completed the following year. The class was originally numbered 106, but NSB changed the numbering system in 1956, and the class was renumbered to 66. The units consisted of three cars, given the lettering BFM, B and BS. They were numbered 66.01–04, 66.31–34 and 66.61–64, respectively; this numbering system dates from 1970.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 2008, {{the project}} had been {{estimated}} {{at a total}} cost of $3.1 billion USD, however the revised project has an estimated cost of $1 billion USD (The difference in estimates partially {{due to differences in}} previous tunnel designs). Financial closing on the project was reached in October, 2009. Miami-Dade County allegedly contributed $402 million, the city of Miami $50 million, and the state $650 million to build, operate and maintain it. Those contributions are spread <b>during</b> <b>construction</b> and operation of the tunnel project. <b>During</b> <b>construction,</b> 90% of the funds are provided by the private sector. Of the estimated one billion dollar total project cost, 607 million it said to go to design and construction, 195.1 million to financing, 59.6 million to insurance and maintenance <b>during</b> <b>construction,</b> 41.2 million to reserves, and 209.8 million for state development cost.|$|E

5|$|Designed by the {{architectural}} firm of Deeter & Ritchey, the complex {{was completed in}} 1963 and was named for former chancellor Edward Litchfield following his death in an airplane crash in 1968. The complex consists of three towers, which <b>during</b> <b>construction</b> were designated A, B, and C in {{the architectural}} plans. The names stuck after the towers were completed, and the towers are still so named today.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{planes were}} {{initially}} only fitted at the stern, but additional planes were {{mounted on the}} conning tower <b>during</b> <b>construction</b> of B1, B2, and B3; B4 was not fitted with them and it is uncertain if the remaining boats received them <b>during</b> <b>construction.</b> These greatly improved the boats' depth-keeping, surfacing and diving abilities compared to the A-class boats. These were later exchanged for bow planes; the last boat to receive them was B6, which did not get hers until January 1916. The B-class submarines lacked any internal bulkheads which exposed the crew to the petrol engine's exhaust fumes. In fact mice were used to detect any concentrations of carbon monoxide inside the hull. Ventilation was provided for the batteries, but none for the crew's living area. No accommodations were provided for the crew and {{they were forced to}} improvise while at sea. In recognition of this issue, the crew's endurance was only expected to be four days during the summer and three days during the winter.|$|E

Prior to the 1999 season, where Lyn would have {{to play in the}} First Division, Lyn applied to play all their matches at Bislett to cut rental costs at Ullevaal. However, this was rejected by the municipality, who owned Bislett, because there was not vacant capacity at Bislett.|$|E

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>construction</b> on 10 February 1959, John Tonkin, {{then the}} Deputy Premier and Minister for Works, {{announced}} that the new bridge was to be named the Golden West Bridge. However, Golden West was also the name for a popular soft drink; the proposal encountered scorn from commentators and was quietly dropped.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>construction</b> or winter {{storms that}} require closing Loveland Pass, {{there is a}} {{procedure}} in place to allow hazardous material trucks to use the tunnel.

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>construction,</b> First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill {{attempted}} {{to arrange for}} Australia to remain in British waters on completion. Although the claim was made on strategic grounds, the reasoning behind it was so the Australian-funded ship could replace one to be purchased with British defence funds. This plan was successfully resisted by Admiral George King-Hall, then Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's Australia Squadron.|$|E

5|$|On September 22, 1915, {{there was}} an {{explosion}} <b>during</b> <b>construction</b> of the 23rd Street subway station that caused the tunnel to collapse. Seven people were killed after a blast of dynamite in the subway tunnel destroyed the plank roadway over Seventh Avenue. As a result, a crowded trolley car, and a brewery truck fell into the excavation, accounting for most of the injuries.|$|E
