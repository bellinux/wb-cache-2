However, the current disposal practices, mainly based on advertising and collecting status, are unsatisfactory in most countries and regions. Thus, some scholars proposed an alternative disposal practice that is to provide incentives to customers. This study aims to compare a Single Model (advertising only) with a <b>Joint</b> Model (<b>advertising</b> with take-back pricing) in a two-echelon reverse supply chain (RSC) that is composed of one disposer and one collector. In each model, four games (non-cooperative, collector as the Stackelberg leader, disposer as the Stackelberg leader, and cooperative) were established in order to identify the optimal pricing and advertising strategies for both members. The results of the study indicate that there is a Pareto dominant range for Joint Model compared to Single Model, whereas Single Model has no Pareto improvement in any games. Furthermore, in non-cooperative games of Joint Model, it is better to implement the leader-follower structure rather than simultaneous movement structure. Additionally, it is verified that the cooperative game is feasible, which leads to the cooperation between the disposer and the collector, and the extra profit from the cooperation can be shared based on the Nash bargaining game. However, in Single Model, it is better for the disposer to act as a channel leader and the collector figures the follower...|$|R

40|$|Firms make {{substantial}} {{investments in}} advertising and personal selling {{to improve their}} performance, but {{it is unclear how}} returns on the promotional mix vary across different corporate-level organizational structures. This article identifies and integrates two structural designs that foster customer alignment, namely, structural type (i. e., organizing corporate-level business units around customer instead of product groups) and structural granularity (i. e., dividing a firm into smaller business units), then investigates how these customer-aligned structural designs moderate the effects of the promotional mix on firm performance. An analysis of 14 years of longitudinal, multisource, secondary data reveals that the performance effect of investments in advertising and personal selling are enhanced by customer-aligned structural designs. However, the synergistic effects of <b>joint</b> investments in <b>advertising</b> and personal selling get suppressed in customer-aligned structures because functional fragmentation results from internal inefficiencies and complexities.

The Chicago Whip newspaper was founded in 1919 by businessman, William C. Linton, and recent Yale Law School graduates, Joseph D. Bibb and Arthur C. MacNeal. The Whip advocated racial militancy and economic radicalism. Civic leaders and journalists expressed mounting concern about the inadequacy of housing as the migration forced the [...] "black belt" [...] to expand. The housing shortage became a major issue in 1917 as blacks moved in increasing numbers into Kenwood, Hyde Park, Woodlawn, Grand Boulevard, Englewood and areas west, and the white population had limited choices of areas to which they could move, because the war had halted home construction and housing was scarce. Whites responded by attempting to tighten the color bar in housing, schools, and public accommodations. Some whites resorted to terrorism and organized guerilla warfare. White [...] "athletic clubs" [...] assaulted blacks on the streets; neighborhood improvement societies bombed black-owned homes. By 1919, blacks were being assaulted on the streets daily. When blacks fought back, the result were the July 1919 riots. The riots lasted 13 days, left 38 people dead, 537 injured, and 1000 black families without homes.|$|E

40|$|The growing {{dominance}} of large retailers has altered traditional channel incentives for manufacturers. In this paper, {{we present a}} theoretical model to illustrate a strategic manufacturer response to a dominant retailer. In our model, a dominant and a weak retailer compete {{for the sale of}} a single product supplied by a single manufacturer. The dominant retailer has the power to dictate the wholesale price, but the manufacturer sets the wholesale price for the weak retailer. The manufacturer also has partial ability to transfer demand between retailers. In the strategic manufacturer response, the manufacturer begins by raising the wholesale price for the weak retailer over that for the dominant retailer. This makes the weak retailer the high-margin channel. The manufacturer then transfers demand to the weak retailer by engaging in <b>joint</b> promotions and <b>advertising.</b> We then use this strategic response model to derive a testable hypothesis that may guide future research in determining the source of dominant retailers' low prices. channels of distribution, channel power, retailing, game theory...|$|R

Understanding brand value appropriation and financial consequences of advertising is important for more focused investments in branding and marketing. This quantitative study sought to understand the <b>joint</b> effects of <b>advertising</b> expenditure and brand value (BV) on firms return on assets (ROA) and on stock return (SR) in the computer industry. The theoretical framework {{of the study was}} the resource-based view theory that proposes that the intangible assets of a corporation have a direct relationship to its ability to sustain its competitive advantage.

40|$|We assess {{size and}} scope-related {{economies in the}} global {{advertising}} and marketing services business. A translog cost function is employed wherein a firmâ€™s costs vary according to its scale and two dimensions {{of the scope of}} its operations. One dimension of firm scope relates to how its output is distributed across the global markets it serves (domestic vs. overseas) and the other to how its output is distributed across the line of services it offers (advertising-related vs. other marketing services). Parameters of the model are estimated via three stage least squares using annual data (1989 - 2001) for an unbalanced panel consisting of the eight largest holding companies in this industry. A firmâ€™s total variable costs are affected by its scale, scope (mix of services and markets served), and by the interaction of the two dimensions of scope. The latter effect suggests that cost economies may accompany the dual diversification strategy of jointly offering advertising and marketing services globally. Estimates indicate that the industryâ€™s long-run cost function is subject to very slight economies of scale, i. e., total variable costs increase less than proportionally as outputs increase. Consistent with the presence of modest global scale economies, product-specific diseconomies of scale accompany growth in volume obtained by extending either breadth of service offerings or market coverage. Scope economies arise when cost savings can be realized by a single firm jointly producing several services or jointly serving multiple markets as compared to splitting up the firm into smaller, stand-alone entities, each one producing just one service or serving a single market. A small cost advantage, typically of approximately two percent, is uniformly associated with joint production of services for both the domestic and overseas markets. Cost savings of a similar magnitude arise consistently from the <b>joint</b> production of <b>advertising</b> as well as other marketing services.

40|$|The overall {{theme of}} this working paper is how {{businesses}} within all industries in a region can make use of characteristics and special resources at their location to increase their long-term profit. The more specific topic focused on is what role tourism can play in other local industries' origin strategies.

If, for instance, local food industries offer tourist products based on existing buildings, competence etc., product synergy may be a result. By market synergy is meant an increase in the customer base for for instance the local food industries. Marketing synergy is used as a concept that includes both the marketing effects of tourists visiting and tasting products, and <b>joint</b> <b>advertising</b> of the place.
