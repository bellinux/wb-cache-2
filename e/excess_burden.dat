40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the literature on}} financing Japanese public pension plans from tax revenue and simulates the economic effects of financing from tax revenue in the short and long terms. From our analysis for the short term, {{we have found that}} financing the basic pension from consumption tax will likely lower the household welfare level compared with financing from social insurance premiums. This is because the <b>excess</b> <b>burdens</b> generated by social insurance premiums, which are imposed on labor, are lighter than <b>excess</b> <b>burdens</b> from consumption tax if the supply of labor is mostly fixed. In the long term, financing public pension plans from consumption tax will help achieve higher economic growth rates than financing from social insurance premiums, which are imposed on income, but will curb consumption by those generations still working and will lower the welfare level. Japan should also avoid depending solely on consumption tax for financing public pension plans from tax revenue because of the regressive nature of the tax. ...|$|R

50|$|One type of {{tax that}} does not create a large <b>excess</b> <b>burden</b> is the {{lump-sum}} tax. A lump-sum tax is a fixed tax that must be paid by everyone and the amount a person is taxed remains constant regardless of income or owned assets. It does not create <b>excess</b> <b>burden</b> because these taxes do not alter economic decisions. Because the tax remains constant, an individual’s incentives and a firm’s incentives will not fluctuate, {{as opposed to a}} graduated income tax that taxes people more for earning more.|$|E

50|$|Generating a {{sufficient}} amount of revenue to finance government {{is arguably the}} most important purpose of the tax system. Optimal taxation, which is the theory of designing and implementing taxes that reduce inefficiency and distortion in the market through Pareto optimal moves under given constraints, is constantly debated. Though inequality will always exist within even the most efficient markets, the goal of taxation is to eliminate as much inefficiency as possible and to raise revenue to fund government expenditures. With any tax, there will be an <b>excess</b> <b>burden,</b> or additional cost, to the consumer and the producer. Whenever the consumer purchases the taxed good or service, and the higher elasticity, or responsiveness, of the demanded product, the greater the <b>excess</b> <b>burden</b> is on either the consumer or producer. Those individuals or corporations who have the most inelastic demand curve pay the brunt of the <b>excess</b> <b>burden</b> curve. However, the tradeoff of placing larger taxes on inelastic goods is that the higher tax will lead to lower quantity exchanged and thus a smaller deadweight loss of reduced revenue.|$|E

Methods: To establish the healthcare needs after the initial wave in 1918, the yearly healthcare records (hospitalizations, outpatients, etc.) in Taiwan during 1918 - 1920 are compared with the corresponding data from the adjacent “baseline ” years of 1916, 1917, 1921, and 1922 to estimate the <b>excess</b> healthcare <b>burden</b> during the initial outbreak in 1918 and in the years immediately after.

We show that different degree of efficiency gain sharply changes the comparisons of optimal subsidy, total outputs and social welfare between mixed and private duopoly. What is more, for an imposition of an optimal subsidy, welfare may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged with privatization, which depends on the level of the cost efficiency gap and the taxation burden. However, {{it may be possible to}} raise welfare through privatization as long as the efficiency gain prevails or no <b>excess</b> taxation <b>burden</b> exists.

50|$|The {{theoretical}} {{foundations of}} the MCF {{can be found in}} the <b>excess</b> <b>burden</b> of taxation as measured by equivalent variation, compensating variation and consumer surplus. Relatedly, the social MCF is the basis for the conditions of an optimal tax system and optimal spending on public services. Thus, the outcome of a tax reform can be calculated using pre- and post-reform MCFs as well as price indices. Practically, MCFs can be calculated based on the tax rate and the elasticities of demand and supply. It is consequently related to the (compensating variation-based) marginal <b>excess</b> <b>burden</b> of taxation (MEB), but is comparatively superior in terms of policy analysis.|$|E
50|$|In a 1997 paper, Don Fullerton and Gilbert E. Metcalf {{evaluated}} the double dividend hypothesis. They define the double-dividend hypothesis as {{the theory that}} environmental taxes can improve the environment and increase economic efficiency simultaneously. Either motivation can legitimately support a tax reform. The first dividend intuitively makes sense: decreasing pollutant emissions improves the environment. The improvement in economic efficiency results from a shift away from distorting taxes such as the income tax. Fullerton and Metcalf note that for every $1 extracted in taxes, a $1.35 burden falls on the economy. In a sense, the private sector must swallow a 35 cent <b>excess</b> <b>burden</b> for no particular reason. The second dividend aims to eliminate some of this <b>excess</b> <b>burden.</b>|$|E

We compare full internalisation of congestion externalities to optimal tax outcomes for the different tax types. In our framework, use taxes restore Pareto optimality since congestion damage rises with more trips. Ownership taxes only partially internalise congestion externalities. However, in terms of revenue-raising ability, the marginal <b>excess</b> <b>burdens</b> in the neighbourhood of optimal taxes are typically lower for ownership taxes than use taxes. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} South Africa’s value added tax (VAT), showing that (1) the VAT is mildly regressive and (2) {{it is an}} effective source of government revenue, compared to other tax instruments in South Africa. We evaluate the VAT {{in the context of}} other distortions in the economy by computing the marginal cost of funds—the effect of raising government revenue by increasing the VAT rates on household welfare. Then we evaluate alternative, revenue-neutral tax systems in which we reduce the VAT and raise income taxes. For the analysis, we use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with detailed specification of South Africa’s tax system. Households are disaggregated into income deciles. We demonstrate that alternative tax structures can benefit low-income households without placing <b>excess</b> <b>burdens</b> on high-income households...|$|R
50|$|According to Dahlby (2008), while a {{substantial}} {{literature on the}} marginal cost of public funds (MCF) has emerged over the last twenty years, much of this literature is fragmented because authors have used different measures for the MCF, or its associated concept, the marginal <b>excess</b> <b>burden</b> (MEB).|$|E
5000|$|The initial {{statement}} of the MCF problem is generally attributed to Pigou (1947), who stressed {{the application of the}} cost-benefit rule to the financing of public spending. Later, the modification of the Samuelson rule for the optimal provision of public services through the inclusion of a measure of the MCF performed by Stiglitz and Dasgupta (1971), Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) and Atkinson and Stern (1974) proved to be a theoretical milestone. Complementary, Harberger's (1964, 1971) contributions on the issue of <b>excess</b> <b>burden</b> measurement further influenced the development of the MCF concept, though he focused on the average <b>excess</b> <b>burden</b> (AEB) rather than on the MEB. The first attempt at measuring the MEB is commonly attributed to Campbell (1975).Measurement of the MCF, however, was first attempted by Browning (1976), although the inclusion of [...] "substitution effects" [...] impairs his exercise.|$|E
5000|$|Standard {{economic}} {{theory suggests that}} a land value tax would be extremely efficient - unlike other taxes, it does not reduce economic productivity. Milton Friedman described Henry George's tax on unimproved value of land as the [...] "least bad tax", since unlike other taxes, it would not impose an <b>excess</b> <b>burden</b> on economic activity (leading to zero or even negative [...] "deadweight loss"); hence, a replacement of other more distortionary taxes with a land value tax would improve economic welfare. As land value tax can improve the use of land and redirect investment toward productive, non-rentseeking activities, it could even have a negative deadweight loss that boosts productivity. Because land value tax would apply to foreign land speculators, the Australian Treasury estimated that land value tax was unique in having a negative marginal <b>excess</b> <b>burden,</b> meaning that it would increase long-run living standards.|$|E
40|$|In Germany {{economic}} {{experts and}} politicians are proposing a fundamental {{reform of the}} health-care system by which the current wage-dependent contributions are replaced by flat-rate insurance premiums. One major reason behind this proposal is the wish to avoid the distortion effects caused by the present form of levying the fees, which works like a wage income tax. The purpose of this note is to show by some simple axiomatics that these hopes may be exaggerated. As social compensation is required, the reform as such does not automatically reduce the distortion effects of the current system. Welfare gains will only be generated by some additional features of the proposed system change, which are briefly discussed {{at the end of}} the paper. health-care reform, flat rate premiums, <b>excess</b> <b>burdens</b> of income taxation...|$|R

Similarly, the marginal <b>excess</b> <b>burdens</b> for efficiency and equity (poverty) are quite low, suggesting much smaller impacts of the intervention on both economic activity and equity.   Furthermore, a fiscal policy reform that raises fuel levy by 10 per cent is progressive as it has stronger negative effects on higher income households than the lower income households. A potential source of instability for the macroeconomy and total government revenue is the negative effect on economic activity induced by the fuel levy increase. The remedies suggested are that policymakers should make tax room elsewhere in the intergovernmental fiscal system to accommodate the fuel levy increase...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{conducting}} economic policy, governments generally face {{conflicts in}} various objectives, e. g. between efficiency and equity. In Norway, one objective of energy politics {{has been to}} reduce electricity consumption, and several tax increases have been proposed. Whether this objective may be in conflict with objectives of efficiency and equity is the focus in this paper. We discuss the effects on household behaviour of three different electricity tax schemes, one proportional and two non-linear. For each household we estimate the reduction in household electricity consumption. As measures of distributional effects and efficiency effects we estimate compensating variation and <b>excess</b> tax <b>burden</b> from the tax schemes. We find that the non-linear tax scheme targeting high electricity consumption is most preferred {{in order to reduce}} consumption and least preferred concerning the objective of minimizing <b>excess</b> tax <b>burden.</b> When considering distributional effects, the ranking of tax schemes depends on the weight placed on different household groups.

40|$|A static computable general {{equilibrium}} {{model of}} South Africa is adapted to compare new taxes on water demand by two industries, namely forestry, and irrigated field crops. Comparisons are made with respect to both the short and the long run, in terms of three target variables, namely (i) the environment; (ii) the economy; and (iii) equity. Since the taxes on the two industries do not raise {{the same amount of}} revenue, the target variables are calculated per unit of real government revenue raised by the new taxes (also referred to as the marginal <b>excess</b> <b>burdens</b> of the taxes). The model results are robust for moderate values of the water elasticity of demand in the two industries, in both the long and the short run. The tax on irrigated field crops performs better in terms of all three the target variables in the short run. In the long run the tax on irrigated filed crops is better in terms of water saving, but reduces real GDP and the consumption by poor households. ...|$|R

50|$|In economics, the <b>excess</b> <b>burden</b> of taxation, {{also known}} as the {{deadweight}} cost or deadweight loss of taxation, is one of the economic losses that society suffers as the result of taxes or subsidies.

Excess burdens can be measured using the average cost of funds or the marginal cost of funds (MCF). Excess burdens were first discussed by Adam Smith.|$|E
5000|$|He {{wanted to}} confront {{the problem of how}} to adjust {{consumption}} tax rates, under specified constraints, so that the reduction of utility is at a minimum.

However, practically, it is problematic to constrain social planners to one form of taxation. It is better to enable them to consider all possible tax structures.|$|E
50|$|In modern {{economic}} literature, {{the most}} common measure of a taxpayer’s loss from a distortionary tax, such as a tax on bicycles, is the equivalent variation, the maximum amount that a taxpayer {{would be willing to}} forgo in a lump sum to avoid the distortionary tax. The deadweight loss can then be interpreted as the difference between the equivalent variation and the revenue raised by the tax. The difference is attributable to the behavioural changes induced by a distortionary tax that are measured by a substitution effect. However, that is not the only interpretation, and Lind and Granqvist (2010) point out that Pigou did not use a lump sum tax as the point of reference to discuss deadweight loss (<b>excess</b> <b>burden).</b>|$|E
