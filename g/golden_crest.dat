500|$|The {{goldcrest}} (Regulus regulus) is a {{very small}} passerine bird in the kinglet family. Its colourful <b>golden</b> <b>crest</b> feathers gives rise to its English and scientific names, and possibly to it being called the [...] "king of the birds" [...] in European folklore. Several subspecies are recognised across the very large distribution range that includes much of Eurasia and the islands of Macaronesia. Birds from the north and east of its breeding range migrate to winter further south.|$|E

In stark contrast, the wing coverts, flight feathers and tail are dark grey to black, as is the prominent thick neck ruff. The head and neck are devoid of feathers, the skin shades of red and purple on the head, vivid orange on the neck and yellow on the throat. On the head, the skin is wrinkled and folded, and there is a highly noticeable irregular <b>golden</b> <b>crest</b> attached on the cere above its orange and black bill; this caruncle does not fully form until the bird’s fourth year.|$|E

50|$|It may be {{confused}} with the least grebe, although that species is much smaller and has a thinner bill. Other similarly sized grebes are very distinct in plumage, i.e. the eared grebe and horned grebe. Both species bear much more colorful breeding plumage, with rufous sides, <b>golden</b> <b>crests</b> {{along the side of the}} head against contrasting slaty color (also a rufous neck in the horned); while in winter, both the eared and horned grebes are pied with slaty and cream color and have red eyes.|$|R

60|$|For a {{week before}} the {{operation}} that was to raise him from his servitude and inferiority {{to the level of a}} blind citizen Nunez knew nothing of sleep, and all through the warm, sunlit hours, while the others slumbered happily, he sat brooding or wandered aimlessly, trying to bring his mind to bear on his dilemma. He had given his answer, he had given his consent, and still he was not sure.

The words I {{have just}} used, [...] "pictorial scholarship," [...] and [...] "pictorial theology," [...] remind me how strange it must appear {{to you that}} in this sketch of the {{intellectual}} state of Italy {{in the thirteenth century}} I have taken no note of literature itself, nor of the fine art of Music with which it was associated in minstrelsy. The corruption of {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "clerk," [...] from [...] "a chosen person" [...] to [...] "a learned one," [...] partly indicates the position of literature in the war between the <b>golden</b> <b>crest</b> and scarlet cap; but in the higher ranks, literature and music became the grace of the noble's life, or the occupation of the monk's, without forming any separate class, or exercising any materially visible political power. Masons or butchers might establish a government,--but never troubadours: and though a good knight held his education to be imperfect unless he could write a sonnet and sing it, he did not esteem his castle to be at the mercy of the [...] "editor" [...] of a manuscript. He might indeed owe his life to the fidelity of a minstrel, or be guided in his policy by the wit of a clown; but he was not the slave of sensual music, or vulgar literature, and never allowed his Saturday reviewer to appear at table without the cock's comb.|$|E
