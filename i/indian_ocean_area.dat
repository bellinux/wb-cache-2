Rear-Admiral Christie judged that military personnel and civilians in Western Australia had become complacent before the emergency, and the mobilisation had gone some way to addressing this. The RAAF and USAAF also regarded the transfer of forces to Western Australia as having provided useful experience in rapidly redeploying combat units. An editorial published in the newspaper The West Australian on 13 March also judged that the air raid alert on 10 March had given Perth's population a reminder of the potential threat posed by [...] "hit and run" [...] raids, but was highly critical of the lack of information which had been released on the cause of the alert, {{especially in light of the}} rumours which were sweeping the city.|$|E
2500|$|Based on {{stable isotope}} levels, eight Cobern Street Burial Ground {{individuals}} consumed a diet based on C4 (tropical) plants in childhood, then consumed more C3 plants, which were more common at the Cape later in their lives. [...] Six {{of these individuals}} had dental modifications similar to those carried out by peoples inhabiting tropical areas known to be targeted by slavers who brought enslaved individuals {{from other parts of}} Africa to the colony. [...] Based on this evidence, Cox et al. argue that these individuals represent enslaved persons from areas of Africa where C4 plants are consumed and who were brought to the Cape as laborers. Cox et al. do not assign these individuals to a specific ethnicity, but do point out that similar dental modifications are carried out by the Makua, Yao, and Marav peoples. [...] Four individuals were buried with no grave goods, in accordance with Muslim tradition, facing Signal Hill, which is a point of significance for local Muslims. Their isotopic signatures indicate that they grew up in a temperate environment consuming mostly C3 plants, but some C4 plants. [...] Many of the isotopic signatures of interred individuals indicate that they Cox et al. argue that these individuals were from the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> <b>area.</b> They also suggest that these individuals were Muslims. [...] Cox et al. argue that stable isotopic analysis of burials, combined with historical and archaeological data can be an effective way in of investigating the worldwide migrations forced by the African Slave Trade, as well as the emergence of the underclass and working class in the colonial Old World.|$|E

The present communication provides information on their distribution, availability, abundance, length composition and spawning of skipjack based on the catch statistics and biological data obtained by the longline operations of Japanese commercial and research vessels. Relative density indices show that they were widely distributed in the western <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> during the first quarter, in the eastern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and northwest coast of Australia in the second quarter and in the third and fourth quarters they were widely distributed in the tropical waters. Their overall abundance and average density were at its peak in June, although they evinced seasonal variation. The fishes of the size group 58 - 70 cm dominated the longline catches, especially from the northern sector. In the central and eastern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> the specimens examined were relatively smaller.
