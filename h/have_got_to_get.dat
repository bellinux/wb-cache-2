500|$|Hurley was by now {{aware that}} his forward was using drugs, and {{attempted}} to keep his player's habit a secret while he patiently worked {{to bring him back}} around. However, Friday began to regularly miss training and Hurley's subtlety was misinterpreted as inaction by the other Reading players, who became unsettled and complained about Friday's conduct. The club became increasingly minded to sell him, but although top-flight clubs Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United were interested, they were reluctant to buy because of Friday's temperament; in Downs's words, [...] "They weren't sure they could handle him". By the end of October 1976, Hurley had given up on attempting to rehabilitate his player, believing that the only solution was to sell him to a bigger team. [...] "The squad needs you but I owe it to the club because I can't have you using drugs," [...] Hurley told Friday. [...] "If I know you're using drugs it won't take them [...] long to find out. You <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> your act together." [...] Friday was made available for transfer, at his own request, on 28 October.|$|E
2500|$|... "To hear a {{supporter}} say MyFootballClub are preventing investment from someone shows the desperation {{people are in}} and exposes the way that club is being run, which {{is not in a}} sustainable way. [...] They <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a grip of that business rather than run after a guy who is promising four-year contracts and saying it's okay. [...] It {{is one of the worst}} proposals I have ever seen put to anyone." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the very}} soil that had nourished the Populist {{movement}} of the 1880s and 1890s, Southern progressivism connected with farmers, middle class workers, and small businessmen. While Southern reformists had historically been urban and middle class in nature, the growing pressures of monopoly and economic manipulation resulted in the political union between discontented farmers and middle class businessmen. [...] "A new South has arisen, a South that {{is made up of}} young, progressive and wide-awake men," [...] Alabama reformist Joseph Manning told a Northern newspaper in the late 1890s. [...] "Now we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a new regime in office, new blood, new brains; got to change the whole system and whole spirit of the South…" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{excitement}} of that last little bit was 'orrible. Fust {{of all we}} <b>'ad</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the mattress, and then in some way we <b>'ad</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid o' Jimmy. Bill's idea was {{for me to take}} 'im ashore with me and tell 'im that Bill would join us arterwards, and then lose 'im; but I said that till I'd got my share I couldn't bear to lose sight o' Bill's honest face for 'alf a second.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll {{be on hand}} if you'll {{promise not}} to keep us out after twelve o'clock, Buster. The eleven <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> its sleep, {{remember}} that." ...|$|R
6000|$|Pratt grinned. [...] "Wal, {{you see how}} it is, youngster, you an' me <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> down <b>to</b> a money basis. Them young uns claim all my stawk." ...|$|R
2500|$|Brown {{called his}} team {{together}} {{the night before}} the Test began. His first words were [...] "Chaps, you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> stuck into this with me. I have not lost faith. We can win if we go out there to-morrow and get stuck right into it." [...] He told them that he knew they had not produced their English form. He told them that their batting, bowling, fielding and catching were too often just too bad to be true. Chosen, as they were, to represent their country, they obviously could do better. Brown's told them just what he thought of everything. He finished by saying that if they went on to the field on the morrow with confidence in themselves, they could do the job.|$|E
2500|$|Further, Wilby {{submitted}} {{that the}} Council committed {{a criminal act}} when they allowed the movement of toxic waste without a licence: in 1986 there was no proper permission in place for moving the contaminated waste, only for moving 'inert' waste. Inspectors were not told {{the true nature of}} the substances involved and so took only sporadic samples from the site. Wilby said that the council had deliberately ignored the advice from experts to properly analyse the site because it was going to be an expensive task. He said: [...] "They decided they were going to do this 'dig-and-dump'. They thought 'we have got this great deal of land and all this spoil on this site which must be contaminated, we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it off there because we'll never be able to sell it.'" [...] Records demonstrated that in one test which took place in 1983 only five soil samples were collected to represent a [...] area.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them to {{the lake}} somehow," [...] said Snap. [...] "So the sooner we get at the job the better. Don't grumble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Odious? Eh? And {{you have}} no notion what a mass of work he <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through every day. He does it all himself. Seems unable to trust anyone with these Fisheries.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{many more}} are there of you Simpsons?" [...] he asked. [...] "I <b>'ve</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> home, and if your family 's much larger this thing is liable to keep on all night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she ses, [...] "if {{you must}} know, I’m in a difficulty; I <b>’ave</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> three pounds, and where <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it I don’t know {{any more than}} the man in the moon. Now let’s talk about {{something}} else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some {{kind of a}} watchman," [...] {{answered}} Loring. [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of {{this neighborhood}} in railroad time or the jig's up," [...] he added.|$|E
6000|$|... "He can't aid himself, that is sure," [...] murmured Dave. [...] "Roger, we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{him out of}} that--before {{that water}} pouring over his {{shoulder}} carries him down!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of here," [...] {{said the}} hotel man, {{speaking}} to the negroes. [...] "And you must go, too," [...] he added to the traveling man.|$|E
60|$|But he {{remained}} too late. The inner gate was locked, and the lodge closed. After a little fruitless knocking with his hand, {{he was standing}} there with the disagreeable conviction upon him that he <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through the night, when a voice accosted him from behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, thank you," [...] she said, when he {{had written}} the card full on both sides. [...] "He <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them in the nicest binding, too. I shall tell him about their helping to furnish the room, and then he can't object." [...] She {{remained}} with the card, looking at it rather wistfully.|$|R
5000|$|Bucking the Sarge (2004) - Luther T. Farrell <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of Flint, Michigan. He {{just needs}} to escape the evil empire of the local slumlord, [...] "The Sarge", aka his mother. Bucking the Sarge was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} best children's books of the year by various publications and organizations, including Publishers Weekly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] he said. [...] "So {{long as you}} can get up honestly, you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up. You can't stop in the pushing {{crowd at}} the bottom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know better}} than to ask such a question," [...] he replied. [...] "But if we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to the grind, why, we might as well do it." ...|$|E
60|$|We <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{ready for}} it. Indeed, {{we have to}} make it--by {{education}} and intention and set resolve. Socialism is to be attained not by fate, but by will.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scene where}} Homer blocks Marge from getting Bart {{out of the}} coffin, telling her, [...] "He <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> over his fear of coffins," [...] {{is derived from the}} opening scene from [...] "Tennis the Menace" [...] where Bart gets trapped in a coffin and starts to panic. Homer watches him panic on a closed circuit TV.|$|R
60|$|Yes, every danged {{member of}} the tribe {{has gone to the}} hotel and left me lost. I wonder how they can be so {{careless}} with property. I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there by myself now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sailed her clean under, and, {{with the}} ballast she carried, went {{straight}} to bottom," [...] 'Frisco Kid gasped. Then, turning to their own pressing need, he said: [...] "Now we <b>'ve</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> look out for ourselves. The back of the storm broke in that puff, but the sea 'll kick up worse yet as the wind eases down. Lend a hand and hang on with the other. We <b>'ve</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her head-on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The rascal!" [...] muttered Dick. [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{him back}} to jail, that's sure! Are you sure you are well enough to go with me, Dad? [...] " ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Cassidy, [...] "I've {{no kind of}} use {{for a man who}} doesn't {{know enough}} to keep himself from getting hurt. You <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that foot better right away or get out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} fellows would stop your {{nonsense}} and talk baseball," [...] came from Bob Grimes, another student. [...] "Do {{you realize that}} if we expect to do anything this spring, we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> busy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{care for}} that,' Jacob said sturdily; 'if it <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> dirty it <b>has</b> <b>got</b> to; that ain't my fault; {{but it is}} my fault if it starts dirty. It ain't often one gets a chance o' doing it, but as we was in good time to-day I thought I would have a clean up. Ned had seen to the horses, so I looked to the cart.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She awoke, after midnight, and worried: [...] "I mustn't forget <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{after the}} Adine Company, {{the very first}} thing in the morning.

I wish Eddie Schwirtz were going to take me out for a walk to-morrow, the old darling that he is-- I'd walk anywhere rather than ask Mr. Wilkins for those blame waste-baskets!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but so has {{the gentleman}} whose seat you <b>have</b> taken <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there," [...] I remonstrated; [...] "what about him? You are {{thinking}} only of yourself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll hitch up {{our biggest}} team and take our time," [...] said Dick. [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{down to the}} post-office somehow." [...] He was hoping desperately that he would find a letter from Dora there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure! But it's always {{closed at}} night," [...] snapped Reddy. [...] "Besides, {{to get to}} that or the door either, you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> inside the henyard, and there's a gate to that which we can't open." ...|$|E
60|$|And I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up that book, too. Cut {{my letters}} {{out of the}} Alta's {{and send them to}} me in an envelop. Some, here, that are not mailed yet, I shall have to copy, I suppose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{followed}} her. She {{went to a}} {{house in}} Thurloe Square. I waited outside and thought it over. I <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into that shanty and make her acquaintance, if they threw me out on my ear. So I rang the bell. 'Is Lady Lichenhall at home?' I asked.

6000|$|... 'Here's a man who, {{even for}} the sake of his own sister, won't hear the truth, just because he hates his sister's husband! What <b>have</b> I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> by lying?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Irene {{passed her}} glove over her forehead. [...] "I always get him {{mixed up with}} Cooper. Well, papa <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them. If we have a library, we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> books in it. Pen says it's {{perfectly}} ridiculous having one. But papa thinks whatever the architect says is right. He fought him hard enough at first. I don't see how any one can keep the poets and the historians and novelists separate in their mind. Of course papa will buy them if we say so. But I don't see how I'm ever {{going to tell him}} which ones." [...] The joyous light faded out of her face and left it pensive.|$|R
