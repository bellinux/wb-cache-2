40|$|In {{order to}} provide {{effective}} cooling for astronauts during extravehicular activities (EVAs), a liquid cooling and ventilation garment (LCVG) is used to remove heat by a series off <b>tubes</b> through which <b>cooling</b> water is circulated. To better predict {{the effectiveness of the}} LCG and determine possible modifications to improve performance, computer simulations dealing with the interaction of the cooling garment with the human body have been run using the Wissler Human Model. Simulations have been conducted to predict the heat removal rate for various liquid cooled garment configurations. The current LCVG uses 48 <b>cooling</b> <b>tubes</b> woven into a fabric with cooling water flowing through the tubes. The purpose of the current project is to decrease the overall weight of the LCVG system. In order to achieve this weight reduction, advances in the garment heat removal rates need to be obtained.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to scientifically {{understand}} the operation of the plunger cooling system and quantify the heat transferred from the parison to the plunger during the glass container production process. The paper highlights the results attained and the problems encountered during this investigation. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the cooling air flowing within the plunger <b>cooling</b> <b>tube</b> system used experimental data obtained from both the laboratory test rig and container manufacturing process on the shop floor. Preliminary results attained demonstrated choking together with recirculation of air in some areas along the airflow passage. This confirmed previous findings that areas of excessive tool temperature and rapid tool wear were caused by the ineffective heat extraction. The ineffective heat extraction can be attributed to the poor circulation of cooling air in the plunger.

40|$|A {{new process}} named as "Damper <b>Cooling</b> <b>Tube</b> method" has been {{proposed}} for semi-solid slurry production. The new process absorbs some characteristics of "new MIT method" and "Cooling Slope method", and makes improvement from these two methods.

The semi-solid slurry is formed in a <b>cooling</b> <b>tube</b> therefore the exposure of magnesium to air is eliminated. This avoids the oxidation or inflammation of magnesium molten melt. In order to effectively control the cooling intensity and solid fraction of semi-solid slurry of Mg alloy, cooling and heating devices are designed around the tube, which facilitate to adjust the temperature inside the tube. Two kinds of damper are designed in the paper. One is sphenoid insert DCT. The sphenoid damper will mix the molten alloy uniformly. The other is screw insert DCT, {{in which there is}} a cone-shaped screw insert in the <b>cooling</b> <b>tube.</b> The screw insert can mix the semi-solid slurry uniformly.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the prediction of the low cycle thermal fatigue behavior of a component in a developmental (ATD) high pressure liquid oxygen turbopump (HPOTP) for the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). This component is called the Turnaround Duct (TAD). The TAD is a complex single piece casting of MAR-M- 247 material. Its function is to turn the hot turbine exhaust gas (1200 F hydrogen rich gas steam) such that it can exhaust radially out of the turbopump. In very simple terms, the TAD consists of two rings connected axially by 22 hollow airfoil shaped struts with the turning vanes placed at the top, middle, and bottom of each strut. The TAD is attached to the other components of the pump via bolts passing through 14 of the 22 struts. Of the remaining 8 struts, four are equally spaced (90 deg interval) and containing a <b>cooling</b> <b>tube</b> through which liquid hydrogen passes on its way to cool the shaft bearing assemblies.

40|$|Models {{have been}} {{developed}} to simulate the thermal performance of RF columns fully loaded with radioactive cesium. Temperature distributions and maximum temperatures across the column were calculated during Small Column Ion Exchange (SCIX) process upset conditions with a focus on implementation at Hanford. A two-dimensional computational modeling approach was taken to include conservative, bounding estimates for key parameters such that the results will provide the maximum centerline temperatures achievable under the design configurations using a feed composition known to promote high cesium loading on RF. The current full-scale design for the SCIX system includes a central <b>cooling</b> <b>tube,</b> and one objective of these calculations was to examine its elimination to simplify the design. Results confirmed that a column design without a central <b>cooling</b> <b>tube</b> is feasible for RF, allowing for the possibility of significant design simplifications if it can be assumed that the columns are always filled with liquid. With active cooling through the four outer tubes, the maximum column diameter expected to maintain the temperature below the assumed media and safety limits is 26 inches, which is comparable to the current design diameter. Additional analysis was conducted to predict the maximum column temperatures for the previously unevaluated accident scenario involving inadvertent drainage of liquid from a cesium-saturated column, with retention of the ion exchange media and cesium in the column. As expected, much higher maximum temperatures are observed in this case due to the poor heat transfer properties of air versus liquid. For this hypothetical accident scenario involving inadvertent and complete drainage of liquid from a cesium-saturated column, the modeling results indicate that the maximum temperature within a 28 inch diameter RF column with external cooling is expected to exceed 250 C within 2 days, while the maximum temperature of a 12 inch column is maintained below 100 C. In addition, the calculation results demonstrate that the <b>cooling</b> <b>tube</b> system external to an air-filled column is not highly effective at reducing the maximum temperature, but the baseline design using a central <b>cooling</b> <b>tube</b> inside the column provides sufficient cooling to maintain the maximum temperature near the assumed safety limit...|$|R

40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} thermodynamic operating parameter {{goals for the}} steady state operation of the control dewar/solenoid system. Specifically, how the control dewar pressure control valve, PV- 3062 -H and the magnet flow control valve EVMF are operated to give the lowest possible temperature fluid at the solenoid magnet. The goals are: (1) For PV- 3062 -H - The process variable is the helium reservoir pressure, minimize the reservoir pressure, provide only enough pressure plus a little margin to ensure leads flow; and (2) For EVMF - The process variable is firstly a manual setpoint of flowrate as read by the flow venturi, FE 3253 -H, and secondly the reservoir liquid level, minimize the pressure drop thru the solenoid <b>cooling</b> <b>tubes,</b> provide at least enough flow to maintain reservoir level and stable operation of the magnet. The thermodynamic states for the fluid thru the system are shown on the Pressure versus Temperature graph. Lines of constant enthalpy are also shown. State A is shown as two phase liquid entering the inlet of the subcooler. The subcooler subcools the fluid to State B. State B to State C {{is caused by the}} pressure drop across EVMF. State C to D is the estimated pressure drop from the outlet of EVMF thru the solenoid <b>cooling</b> <b>tubes</b> and back up to the helium reservoir inlet. To give the coolest fluid in the <b>cooling</b> <b>tubes,</b> the two phase fluid in the reservoir should be at the lowest pressure (and thus temperature). This lowest pressure is limited by the required pressure for leads flow and if this does not dominate, the low pressure side pressure drop thru the refrigerator and suction pressure set point. My guess is the lead flow requirement will dominate. I suggest putting the PV- 3062 -H set point such that the lead flow control valves operate at about 80 % open. The second parameter that will give the coolest fluid in the <b>cooling</b> <b>tubes</b> is a minimized pressure drop thru the <b>cooling</b> <b>tubes.</b> This can be accomplished by providing a minimized flowrate, sufficient only to ensure that the reservoir level is full and some liquid fraction leaves the helium outlet tubing. D-Zero Engineering note, EN- 338, 'LHe Flow Regime/Pressure Drop for DO Solenoid at Steady State Conditions' shows that even though the gas fraction increases at lower flowrates, the pressure drop decreases. This goal is ideal, and assumes good cooling at the magnet. Real effects such hot spots or quench experience in the magnet may necessitate a higher flowrate. The current design flow rate from Toshiba is somewhere around 2. 5 gls which is very low. Experience with the accuracy of the venturi flowmeter, coil characteristics etc. and some conservativeness will help determine the optimum flowrate. I would venture a guess {{that it would be a}} minimum of 5 g/s.
