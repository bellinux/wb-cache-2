Traditionally styled double-glazed sash windows will often attempt to mimic the original appearance {{through the use of}} non-functional muntins or [...] "glazing bars", which are applied {{to the surface of the}} glazing, and give the appearance that the sash is made up of several smaller panes, whereas in reality, each sash consists of only one large <b>double-glazed</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis treats angle-resolved optical {{properties}} {{and the energy}} efficiency of windows. A theoretical evaluation of optical and thermal properties of windows is briefly surveyed and the energy performance of a large selection of windows, under different conditions, is examined. In particular, angle dependent {{optical properties}} are analysed. A new model assessing angle dependence of the total solar energy transmittance, g, of windows is presented. A comparison of simple models for angle-dependence prediction has been performed, including both fictitious and measured real window glazings. The new proposed model illustrates low errors for both the real and the fictitious glazings. The impact of inaccuracy in the angle dependence of the g-factor has been assessed and found to be clearly noticeable but not necessarily critical. A simple model for comparing the energy efficiency of different windows in different types of buildings and different climates has been further developed and analysed for several conditions. The energy performance {{of a large number}} of windows has been analysed using this model, and also by using other building and window simulation models. Typical savings when changing from a standard double glazed window to the optimal window for the investigated case is in the order of 100 - 150 kWh/m 2 yr. The annual energy balance of modern low emittance windows illustrates that they can be annual energy savers rather than energy losers, unlike traditional windows. However, it is shown that it is not important to argue about small changes (~ 0. 01) of the thermal emittance value. Furthermore, advance solar control glazings effectively reduce solar transmittance with maintained high light transmittance. AR-coatings and low-iron glazings can increase the transmittance of glazings considerably. In fact, a "super" low emittance window with a U-value below 1 W/m 2 K can have higher light transmittance than a common <b>double-glazed</b> <b>unit.</b> Windows with variable transmittance, switchable windows, are compared with high-performing solar control windows, illustrating some degree of potential energy savings compared to high performing static solar control windows, depending on the type of control that is used. This is accompanied by the potential for automatic thermal comfort- and glare control. Different models for energy rating of windows have been evaluated, demonstrating that a simple linear rating depending on the U and g-factor of the window may be sufficient with certain restrictions. Division into climate zones is essential. In all, the results demonstrate that energy-efficient windows provide huge energy-saving potentials on a large (regional, national, global) scale...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{sunlight}} {{has always been}} a major goal in the design and operation of commercial buildings to minimize electrical consumption of artificial lighting systems. Glazing systems designed to allow optimal visible light transmission also allow significant unwanted direct solar heat gain caused by infrared light. Conversely, glazing systems that are designed to reflect unwanted direct solar heat gain significantly reduce the transmittance of visible light through windows. The goal of this research was to characterize the performance of water as gap-fill for <b>double-glazing</b> <b>units</b> in eliminating the compromises that exist in current glazing systems with respect to light and heat transmittance. An in situ test approach and computer simulations were conducted to measure the performance of water-filled glazing units against air-filled glazing units. The thermal transmittance and solar heat gain coefficient values obtained from both the field experiments and computer simulations, glazing units with air-fill proved better than the glazing units with non-flowing water-fill. However, the high convective coefficient and the high thermal mass of the water can be used to its advantage when it is allowed to flow at peak temperatures, thus, maintaining lower temperature swings indoor. This can lead to a reduction of about 50 - 70 % direct solar heat and still maintain high visibility...|$|R

50|$|Poor thermal insulation:The late 1960s was age {{of cheap}} energy, {{consequently}} the dwellings {{on the estate}} were not designed to be energy efficient. Some gains have been made through estate-wide programmes to install cavity wall insulation and <b>double-glazed</b> window <b>units.</b> There is a particular problem with the roofs. In order to allow light into the four metre wide pathways between rows of terraces, the roof lines are low, {{and there are no}} lofts. This makes upgrading the roof installation more costly than the same job on a standard house.|$|R
40|$|Both {{panes of}} factory-sealed <b>double-glazing</b> <b>units</b> are {{susceptible}} to thermal breakage. The outer pane experiences large thermally induced stresses when solar radiation falls on the sealed unit in cool weather. The breakage potential is even greater for units with heat-absorbing or heat- reflecting glass in the outer pane than for units with a clear outer pane. The inner pane experiences a high thermal stress when the outdoor air temperature is very low and the unit is subjected to localized heating. The breakage potential of the inner pane is greater for heat-reflecting units with a low U-value than for clear, heat-absorbing, or high-emissivity heat-reflecting units. Measured and calculated values of thermal stress for inner and outer panes of sealed glazing units indicate that thermal stress by itself should not cause glass breakage. Extensive breakage failure will only occur if the thermal stress is augmented by other tensile stresses or if weak or damaged glass is used. In {{the absence of a}} reliable method of predicting the probability of thermal breakage in sealed units, however, all factors that can possibly reduce the potential for breakage should be accommodated in design. This is especially true for units with heat-absorbing and heat-reflecting glass.

50|$|Piecemeal refurbishments in the 1980s, {{when the}} estate needed repairs and upgrades, {{included}} painting, retiling and a secure entry system with ironwork that plays variations on Lubetkin’s trellis grille. Central heating {{was extended to}} all rooms, and some residents tore out the canted-frame fireplaces and steel sinks with Garchey disposal units. After the Grade II* listing of Spa Green in 1998, Homes for Islington with English Heritage initiated a restoration of the entire exterior plus the kitchens and bathrooms of the flats still in council ownership. Deteriorated concrete was recast, windows replaced with <b>double-glazed</b> steel Critall <b>units</b> resembling the originals (though with thicker frames), and Lubetkin’s colours reconstructed - with some wilder primary colours at the entry level.|$|R
40|$|Daylight is a {{valuable}} resource for both energy and human health. However, this resource is often underutilized in buildings due {{to the difficulty of}} controlling the changing qualities of daylight. Deep-plan building spaces pose an especially challenging problem because traditional sidelighting strategies are only effective for workplanes adjacent to the facade. Infrequently adjusted shading systems can also limit the availability of daylight. A number of advanced daylighting systems have been developed that attempt to address these challenges with varying priorities and success. This thesis proposes a new technology named the Soralux Daylighting System. The system is passive, requires no shading adjustments, even under direct sunlight, and works well with deep-plan spaces on the order of 8 to 15 m deep. The Soralux system presents itself as a <b>double-glazing</b> window <b>unit,</b> allowing it to be easily integrated into curtain wall facades typical of deep-plan offices in large cities. Computer simulations using the ray tracing programs Radiance and TracePro were conducted to estimate the annual performance of the system. Variables such as facade orientation, sky obstruction, and climate were evaluated for their effect on system performance. The system was found to increase light levels by a factor of 2 to 10 compared to an unshaded window at depths between 8 and 15 m from the facade. Two physical mockups of the Soralux system were fabricated for testing. The first mockup tested was a small proof-of-concept prototype, while the second was a full-scale mockup which was installed in a Tokyo office building. The physical mockups were used to evaluate visual comfort and appearance. A monitoring campaign was also conducted for the Tokyo mockup and the measured data were compared with a Radiance model of the building space to validate the accuracy of the simulation results. The average error between simulated and measured illuminance values was 16 %. Based on these results, recommendations are provided identifying which scenarios are well-suited for the system. The Soralux Daylighting System is scheduled to be permanently installed into a Tokyo office building in 2012. by Kevin W. Thuot. Thesis (S. M.)
