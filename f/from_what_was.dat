5|$|The {{possibility}} of installing a rail link <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> originally {{known as the}} Broadmeadows line (now the Craigieburn line) to the airport was debated in the 1960s under the Bolte State Government, but with not enough support shown in parliament, the rail project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Trajan's {{successor}} Hadrian {{adopted a}} policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders (fines) were marked, and the frontiers (limites) patrolled.

5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. <b>From</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E
5|$|Following the Union {{defeat at}} Bull Run, panicked {{efforts were made}} to {{strengthen}} the forts built by Barnard in order to defend Washington <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> perceived as an imminent Confederate attack.

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Ramesses XI in 1078BC, Smendes assumed {{authority}} over {{the northern part of}} Egypt, ruling from the city of Tanis. The south was effectively controlled by the High Priests of Amun at Thebes, who recognized Smendes in name only. During this time, Berber tribes <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> later to be called Libya had been settling in the western delta, and the chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy. Libyan princes took control of the delta under Shoshenq I in 945BC, founding the Libyan Berber, or Bubastite, dynasty that ruled for some 200 years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions.|$|E

5|$|In December 1963 Byrne {{took over}} the control of Stramsact in the UK, and then set up Seltaeb (Beatles spelt backwards) in the United States. Epstein was able to renegotiate a more {{favourable}} commission of 49% in August 1964, but then became embroiled in a three-year court battle with Byrne regarding payment of monies due, during which time potential sponsors lost interest. In August 1967 Epstein died, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> ruled an accidental overdose of a prescribed drug. Jacobs was found hanged in his garage on 15 December 1968. Byrne later retired to the Bahamas.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of war, Congress Heights (so called because the Capitol building in downtown Washington could {{be seen from the}} tops of the hills) were owned by the Berry family, who also owned much of the Anacostia River bottomland {{to the west of the}} Heights. In the days following the First Battle of Bull Run, panicked efforts by the Union were made to defend Washington <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. These makeshift entrenchments were largely confined to the direct approaches to Washington and the bridges that spanned the Potomac.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department {{assigned}} M-212 to {{its current}} alignment in Aloha Township <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> then US23 on December29, 1937. The route has remained mainly intact since its assignment. Originally, US23 ran along the highway at the eastern terminus of M-212, but the highway department realigned the highway onto an alignment along the shore of Lake Huron in 1940; that year, the highway department replaced the former US23 alignment with the designation of M-33, which has remained there since.|$|E
5|$|The censors thus {{expanded}} their jurisdiction <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> seen {{to what was}} implied in the spectator's mind. In The Office Wife (1930), several of Joan Blondell's disrobing maneuvers were strictly forbidden and the implied image of the actress being naked just off-screen was deemed too suggestive even though it relied upon the audience using their imaginations, so post-Code releases of the film had scenes which were blurred or rendered indistinct, if allowed at all.|$|E

5|$|The funeral {{scene at}} the end of the film was also played {{differently}} <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> originally intended. Julie Christie was supposed to wear a veil to hide away her face, but prior to filming Roeg suggested to Christie that she should play it without the veil and smile throughout the scene. Christie was initially sceptical, but Roeg felt it would not make sense for the character to be heartbroken if she believed her husband and daughter were together in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|The {{repulsion}} of the Arab {{assault on}} Nicaea {{was an important}} success for the Byzantines. Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717–741) regarded the city's survival {{as a sign of}} divine favour towards his newly instituted iconoclastic policies, and was encouraged to drive them further. This is probably related to an incident mentioned in the account of Theophanes, where a certain Constantine, who served as a groom (strator) to Artabasdos, threw a stone on an icon of the Virgin Mary and then trampled on it. The soldier was killed the next day by a catapult, a fact which Theophanes reports as evidence of divine vengeance. However, this passage shows strong signs of tampering by the fervently anti-iconoclast Theophanes, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> probably originally a pro-iconoclast story.|$|E
