5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} the politicians not <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E
500|$|With the {{mounting}} economic problems, skilled workers were usually {{paid more than}} had been intended in the first place, while unskilled labourers tended to turn up late, and were neither conscientious nor, {{in a number of}} cases, entirely sober. The state usually moved workers from one job to another which ultimately became an ineradicable feature in Soviet industry; the Government had no effective counter-measure because of the country's lack of unemployment. Government industries such as factories, mines and offices were staffed by undisciplined personnel who put a great effort into not <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> This ultimately led to, according to Robert Service, a [...] "work-shy workforce" [...] among Soviet workers and administrators.|$|E
500|$|The {{level of}} dramaticism {{of some of}} the character's storylines, {{as well as those of}} other Holby City nurses was heavily criticised by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The lead article of the July 2007 issue of the NMC {{magazine}} tackled nurses in popular culture, discussing [...] "the ease with which writers can attach terrible storylines to a caring profession", and stating: [...] "Nurses who become prostitutes to pay the bills, nurses who kill their husbands, nurses who abuse the system to get their own way - Holby City has always been a hotbed of slanderous storylines. Good people doing bad things makes excellent entertainment... The bald fact is that real life nurses <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> well just aren't that entertaining." ...|$|E

500|$|The second episode {{included}} {{the death of}} a main character. The idea was originally going {{to be used in the}} series finale. However, the producers did not know how to fill in episode two, so the death was moved up. According to Wolstencroft, the inclusion of Helen's death was to give the audience the message that [...] "the world of Spooks isn't the world where the cavalry always arrive, because in reality these people [...] do risk their lives on our behalf and they do get into sticky situations with genuinely nasty people." [...] The producers also wanted main characters to die on occasion rather than on a weekly or bi-weekly basis; otherwise it would show MI5 officers as not <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> properly. Although Spooks is a serious show, the writers add occasional humour from the characters. According to Wolstencroft, he felt that anybody who works in such an occupation with high responsibilities tends to have humour around, and that those people make jokes even though they have seen [...] "heinous things". This became the basis for creating Jools Siviter.|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} {{published}} in The Guardian, the British Medical Association expressed its [...] "deep concern" [...] over the twenty felony convictions, stating that [...] "all the independent {{evidence points to}} a politically motivated trial which has demonstrated a disregard for proper judicial process and fundamental principles of medical neutrality." [...] The Australian Medical Association condemned the prosecutions, describing the defendants as [...] "simply <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> in places of conflict". Doctors Without Borders criticized doctors at Salmaniya Hospital for joining the protests, but described the military response as [...] "exponentially more damaging" [...] to medical neutrality. In May 2011, the group issued a statement {{on behalf of the}} health workers, urging that [...] "doctors and nurses must be allowed to provide healthcare in line with medical ethics, without the fear of reprisal." [...] The World Health Organization expressed similar concerns, stating that [...] "health-care workers must be able to carry out their duty to treat injured people, regardless of their political affiliation, and even in times of conflict." ...|$|E
500|$|Some critics commented {{negatively}} on {{the characters}} and the show's representation of women. The series was described as an improvement over the backdoor pilot by USA Todays Robert Blanco, but he criticized the doctors' characters as childish and seemingly incapable of <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> Blanco viewed the show as a misstep in Addison's character development, writing that she is [...] "a woman who was once a tough, smart, flawed, sexy adult [...] {{has turned into a}} fluttering, indecisive sorority girl". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times was critical of the show's interpretation of feminism, describing the characters as [...] "one of the most depressing portrayals of the female condition since The Bell Jar", and reminiscent of the [...] "seven stages of womanly despair" [...] in William Hogarth's engraving A Surgeon's Progress. Dough Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that the actors were better than the show's premise and writing, and The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert described the characters as a [...] "stock cast of whiney healers" [...] and the storylines as [...] "hokey, gimmicky medical cases of the week".|$|E

500|$|Sam Dotson, {{chief of}} the St. Louis Police Department, coined the term [...] "Ferguson effect" [...] to {{describe}} what he believed was a change in enforcement behavior following the shooting of Michael Brown and subsequent unrest. According to Dotson, his officers were less active in enforcing the law {{because they were afraid}} they might be charged with breaking the law. FBI Director James Comey suggested that the Black Lives Matter movement is partly leading to a national rise in crime rates because police officers have pulled back from <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> A study published by the Justice Department, said there was an increase in homicides in 56 large cities over the course of 2015, and examined the [...] "Ferguson effect" [...] as one of three plausible explanations. Other researchers have looked for this [...] "Ferguson effect" [...] in the rise in crime rates and failed to find evidence for it on a national level. A report over the increased homicide rate in St. Louis concluded there was an [...] "absence of credible and comprehensive evidence" [...] for the Ferguson effect being responsible for that city's homicide increase.|$|E
2500|$|They say Atropos {{was jealous}} of her sisters because they were {{deciding}} for humans' lives. Clotho was responsible for spinning the thread of human life and Lachesis was the apportioner, deciding how much time for life was to be allowed for each person or being. [...] She measured the thread of life with her rod. She is also said to choose a person's destiny after a thread was measured. In Greek mythology, {{it is said that}} she appears with her sisters within three days of a baby's birth to decide its fate. In between all these Atropos {{was the only one who}} should have sat somewhere and watches her youngest sisters <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs,</b> so that's when her jealousy overcame her feelings and made her to choose the mechanism of death, then she would have been a part of this circle to end humans' lives on certain time which Lachesis decides.|$|E

Karzai said terrorism is rebounding in his country, with militants infiltrating the borders to wage attacks on civilians. He stated, [...] "This does not have its seeds alone in Afghanistan. Military action in the country will, therefore, not deliver the shared goal of eliminating terrorism." [...] He demanded assistance {{from the international community}} to destroy terrorist sanctuaries inside and outside Afghanistan. [...] "You have to look beyond Afghanistan to the sources of terrorism," [...] he told the UN General Assembly, and [...] "destroy terrorist sanctuaries beyond" [...] the country, dismantle the elaborate networks in the region that recruit, indoctrinate, train, finance, arm, and deploy terrorists. These activities are also robbing thousands of Afghan children of their right to education, and prevent health workers from <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> in Afghanistan. In addition, he promised to eliminate opium-poppy cultivation in his country, which is possibly helping fuel the ongoing Taliban insurgency. He has repeatedly demanded that NATO forces take more care to avoid civilian casualties when conducting military operations in residential areas. In a September 2006 video broadcast, Karzai stated that if the money wasted on the Iraq War had been actually spent on rebuilding Afghanistan, his country would [...] "be in heaven in less than one year".|$|E
