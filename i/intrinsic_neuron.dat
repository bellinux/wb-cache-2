40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that inhibitory neurons {{play an important}} role in the generation of synchronous brain rhythms. A number of theoretical studies have been conducted over last decade to determine the properties of the inhibitory neuronal networks that can result in stable network synchrony and much work has focused on synaptic properties of GABA inhibition (the decay time of the synapse and the reversal potential), the heterogeneity in the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>neuron</b> firing rates and the architecture of the underlying networks. Very few studies, however, have focused on the role for explicit signal propagation delays in modulating synchrony in inhibitory networks.

40|$|International audienceThe main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is the derivation of a steepest gradient descent learning rule for a multi-layer network of theta neurons; a one-dimensional non-linear neuron model. Central to our model is the assumption that the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>neuron</b> dynamics are sufficient to achieve consistent time coding, with no need to involve the precise shape of post-synaptic currents; this assumption departs from other related models such as SpikeProp and Tempotron learning. Our results clearly show {{that it is possible to}} perform complex computations by applying supervised learning techniques to the spike times and time response properties of non-linear integrate and fire neurons. Networks trained with our multi-layer training rule are shown to have similar generalization abilities for spike latency pattern classification as Tempotron learning. The rule is also able to train networks to perform complex regression tasks that neither SpikeProp or Tempotron learning appear to be capable of...|$|E

40|$|Our study {{investigates the}} {{innervation}} of the respiratory tract during mouse embryonic development, {{with a focus}} on the identification of cell origin and essential developmental signals for the resident, or <b>intrinsic,</b> <b>neurons.</b> Using lineage tracing, we show that these <b>intrinsic</b> <b>neurons</b> are exclusively derived from neural crest cells, and cluster to form ganglia that reside in the dorsal trachea and medial bronchi with diminishing frequency. Comparisons of intrinsic neurogenesis between wild-type, glial cell–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) −/−, neurturin−/−, and tyrosine kinase receptor Ret−/− embryos, in combination with lung organ cultures, identified that Ret signaling, redundantly activated by GDNF family members, is required for intrinsic neurogenesis in the trachea and primary bronchi. In contrast, Ret deficiency exerts no effect on the innervation {{of the rest of the}} respiratory tract, suggesting that innervation by neurons whose cell bodies are located outside of the lung (so-called extrinsic neurons) is independent of Ret signaling. Furthermore, although the trachea, the esophagus, and their <b>intrinsic</b> <b>neurons</b> share foregut endoderm and a neural crest cell origin, respectively, the signals required for their intrinsic neurogenesis are divergent. Together, our results not only establish the neural crest lineage of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>neurons</b> in the respiratory tract, but also identify regional differences in the abundance and developmental signals of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>neurons</b> along the respiratory tract and in the esophagus...|$|R

40|$|Both in vivo and {{in vitro}} {{recordings}} indicate that neuronal membrane potentials can make spontaneous transitions between distinct {{up and down}} states. At the network level, populations of neurons have been observed to make these transitions synchronously. Although synaptic activity and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>neuron</b> properties play an important role, the precise nature of the processes responsible for these phenomena is not known. Using a computational model we explore the interplay between intrinsic neuronal properties and synaptic fluctuations. Model neurons of the integrate-and-fire type were extended by adding a nonlinear membrane current. Networks of these neurons exhibit large amplitude synchronous spontaneous fluctuations that make the neurons jump between up and down states, thereby producing bimodal membrane potential distributions. The effect of sensory stimulation on network responses depends on whether the stimulus is applied during an up state or deeply inside a down state. External noise can be varied to modulate the network continuously between two extreme regimes in which it remains permanently in either the up or the down state...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{demonstrate}} the independent acquisition of strikingly similar brain architectures across divergent insect taxa and even across phyla under similar adaptive pressures. Convoluted cortical gyri-like structures characterize the mushroom body calyces in {{the brains of}} certain species of insects; we have investigated in detail the cellular and ecological correlates of this morphology in the Scarabaeidae (scarab beetles). “Gyrencephalic” mushroom bodies with increased surface area and volume of calycal synaptic neuropils and increased <b>intrinsic</b> <b>neuron</b> number characterize only those species belonging to generalist plant-feeding subfamilies, whereas significantly smaller “lissencephalic” mushroom bodies are found in more specialist dung-feeding scarab beetles. Such changes are not unique to scarabs or herbivores, because the mushroom bodies of predatory beetles display similar morphological disparities in generalists vs. specialists. We also show that gyrencephalic mushroom bodies in generalist scarabs are not associated {{with an increase in}} the size of their primary input neuropil, the antennal lobe, or in the number of antennal lobe glomeruli but rather with an apparent increase in the density of calycal microglomeruli and the acquisition of calycal subpartitions. These differences suggest changes in calyx circuitry facilitating the increased demands on processing capability and flexibility imposed by the evolution of a generalist feeding ecology...|$|E
40|$|Perceptual {{processing}} in the {{somatosensory system}} {{is crucial for}} humans and animals alike to perceive and interact with their surroundings. As with all cortical systems, information in the somatosensory pathway is processed by populations of densely interconnected neurons that display complex collective dynamics. This thesis is an exploration of neuronal population dynamics during somatosensory processing in humans. We present five inter-related studies into the encoding and processing of tactile vibrations of different frequencies in simple perceptual tasks, {{with the aim of}} uncovering how populations of neurons represent relevant tactile information and support perceptual and cognitive operations. Neuronal population dynamics are examined in two regimes: stimulus-driven dynamics and encoding, memory and decision dynamics. Each examination comprises one experimental and one theoretical study. In the stimulus-driven regime, we study scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and show n:m synchronization between cortical oscillations and periodic tactile stimuli. This indicates that neuronal populations in cortical somatosensory areas behave collectively as a nonlinear oscillator. Subsequent analysis of a model thalamocortical network with periodic forcing reveals that n:m synchronization at the population level emerges from an interaction between <b>intrinsic</b> <b>neuron</b> dynamics, network connections and the periodic input. In the memory intervals of a frequency discrimination task, we show specific patterns of cortical activity measured with EEG that correlate with both the recently encoded stimulus frequency and the distribution of frequencies across the entire stimulus set. This suggests both specific and general features of the stimulus are encoded and retained during this task. Finally, a neuronal population model of tactile frequency discrimination is presented, outlining a candidate mechanism by which cortical networks compare sequentially presented vibrations, and indicating a role for specific and general stimulus information in perceptual discrimination. We hence conclude that populations of neurons in somatosensory areas display complex patterns of activity in response to tactile vibrations in perceptual tasks. Collective dynamic activity in neuronal populations reflects the intrinsic properties of the cortical ensemble as well as multiple levels of information regarding the tactile stimulus and can support perceptual discrimination and other sensory processing...|$|E

Expression of transformer in lines that mark certain subsets of mushroom body <b>intrinsic</b> <b>neurons,</b> and in a line that marks a component of the antennal lobe, causes males to exhibit nondiscriminatory sexual behavior: they court mature males in addition to females.

The olfactory bulb also includes a portion of the anterior olfactory nucleus, the cells of which contribute fibers to the olfactory tract. They are the initial sites for synaptic processing of odor information coming from the nose. A glomerulus is made up of a globular tangle of axons from the olfactory receptor neurons, and dendrites from the mitral and tufted cells, as well as, from cells that surround the glomerulus such as the external tufted cells, periglomerular cells, short axon cells, and astrocytes. In mammals, glomeruli typically range between 50-120 µm in diameter and number between 1100 and 2400 depending on the species, with roughly between 1100 and 1200 in humans. The number of glomeruli in a human decreases with age; in humans that are over 80 they are nearly absent. Each glomerulus is composed of two compartments, the olfactory nerve zone and the non-olfactory nerve zone. The olfactory nerve zone is composed of preterminals and terminals of the olfactory nerve and is where the olfactory receptor cells make synapses on their targets. The non-olfactory nerve zone is composed of the dendritic processes of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>neurons</b> and is where dendrodendritic interactions between <b>intrinsic</b> <b>neurons</b> occur.|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} body {{of evidence}} documents the differential expression of ion channels in brains, suggesting they are essential to endow particular brain structures with specific physiological properties. Because of their role in correlating inputs and outputs in neurons, modulation of voltage-dependent ion channels (VDICs) can profoundly change neuronal network dynamics and performance, and may represent a fundamental mechanism for behavioral plasticity, one that has received less attention in learning and memory studies. Revisiting three paradigmatic mutations altering olfactory learning and memory in Drosophila (dunce, leonardo, amnesiac) a link was established between each mutation and the operation of VDICs in Kenyon cells, the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>neurons</b> of the mushroom bodies (MBs). In Drosophila, MBs {{are essential to the}} emergence of olfactory associative learning and retention. Abnormal ion channel operation might underlie failures in neuronal physiology, and be crucial to understand the abnormal associative learning and retention phenotypes the mutants display.

40|$|After a {{long period}} of {{inconclusive}} observations, the <b>intrinsic</b> primary afferent <b>neurons</b> of the intestine have been identified. The intestine is thus equipped with two groups of afferent neurons, those with cell bodies in cranial and dorsal root ganglia, and these recently identified afferent neurons with cell bodies in the wall of the intestine. The first, tentative, identification of <b>intrinsic</b> primary afferent <b>neurons</b> was by their morphology, which is type II in the terminology of Dogiel. These are multipolar neurons, with some axons that project to other nerve cells in the intestine and other axons that project to the mucosa. Definitive identification came only recently when action potentials were recorded intracellularly from Dogiel type II neurons in response to chemicals applied to the lumenal surface of the intestine and in response to tension in the muscle. These action potentials persisted after all synaptic transmission was blocked, proving the Dogiel type II neurons to be primary afferent neurons. Less direct evidence indicates that <b>intrinsic</b> primary afferent <b>neurons</b> that respond to mechanical stimulation of the mucosal lining are also Dogiel type II neurons. Electrophysiologically, the Dogiel type II neurons are referred to as AH neurons. They exhibit broad action potentials that are followed by early and late afterhyperpolarizing potentials. The <b>intrinsic</b> primary afferent <b>neurons</b> connect with each other at synapses where they transmit via slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials, that last for tens of seconds. Thus the <b>intrinsic</b> primary afferent <b>neurons</b> form self-reinforcing networks. The slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials counteract the late afterhyperpolarizing potentials, thereby increasing the period during which the cells can fire action potentials at high rates. <b>Intrinsic</b> primary afferent <b>neurons</b> transmit to second order neurons (interneurons and motor neurons) via both slow and fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Excitation of the <b>intrinsic</b> primary afferent <b>neurons</b> by lumenal chemicals or mechanical stimulation of the mucosa appears to be indirect, via the release of active compounds from endocrine cells in the epithelium. Stretch-induced activation of the <b>intrinsic</b> primary afferent <b>neurons</b> is at least partly dependent on tension generation in smooth muscle, that is itself sensitive to stretch. The <b>intrinsic</b> primary afferent <b>neurons</b> of the intestine are the only vertebrate primary afferent neurons so far identified with cell bodies in a peripheral organ.

40|$|This account {{describes}} novel mushroom body {{organization in}} a coleopteran insect, the African fruit chafer Pachnoda marginata. Each of its prominent mushroom bodies possesses {{a pair of}} simple calyces comprising two populations of Kenyon cells, the dendrites of which are organized into a central and an annular zone. Kenyon cells of the central zone extend their dendrites downward and toward {{the perimeter of the}} calyx. Their axon-like processes in the pedunculus are densely packed to make up a distinctive shaft of neuropil. Toward the front of the brain, the shafts, one from each calyx, bifurcate to provide a pair of subdivisions in the medial and vertical lobes. Dendrites of Kenyon cells supplying the annular zone extend from the calyx perimeter toward its center. Axons from the annular zones of both calyces together provide a sleeve of axons that ensheaths the two shafts. Sleeve axons bifurcate to provide a second pair of divisions in each of the lobes. These arrangements provide each lobe with a discrete representation of the two Kenyon cell populations of the two calyces. Kenyon cells supplying the central zone have dendritic morphologies reminiscent of class II clawed Kenyon cells that supply the gamma lobes in other taxa. Kenyon cells supplying axons to the sleeve are suggestive of class III Kenyon cell morphologies described from cockroaches and termites. Elaborate <b>intrinsic</b> <b>neurons,</b> comparable to exotic <b>intrinsic</b> <b>neurons</b> in the honey bee gamma lobes, have processes that interact with shaft axons.

Pretreatment with CP- 99994, a neurokinin type 1 receptor antagonist, partially abolished the O 3 -induced reactivity to cholinergic agonists and electrical field stimulation. The O 3 -enhanced airway responses were present in tracheal seg-ments cultured for 24 h, a procedure shown to deplete sen...|$|R
