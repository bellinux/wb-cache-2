40|$|The {{coastal zone}} of Benin is the {{interface}} between the marine environment and the straightforward continental environment. It is constituted of sandy cords, lagoon system, lakes and flood plains. This zone shelters {{a population of about}} 3 million inhabitants that is more than 30 % of the Beninese population. As all coastal regions of the world, this zone remains very sensitive to climatic changes (global elevation of the sea level, perpetual variations of the weather marines conditions) and to human activities (large inland dams, harbour infrastructures, urbanization) that drive to the rupture of the equilibrium in this coastal environment with enhanced risks of beach erosion as the main consequences. This study monitors the evolution of the Beninese shorelines around Cotonou and underlines the causes mainly human that negatively affect this naturally fragile environment. Natural factors (tempests and erosive processes) and human actions (building <b>of</b> the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Cotonou (1962) then Lome (1967) and hydroelectric dams on Volta (1966) and on Mono (1987) rivers) aim the coastal evolution of the Benin. They procreate, on the sandy cords at East <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> and rivers <b>mouths,</b> an erosion about 10 m linked to the reduction of provisions in sand and the fragilisation of cords by farms, steps and of anarchic occupations...|$|R

Although, both the varieties share a common grammar, they differ significantly in their vocabulary to an extent where both become mutually incomprehensible (Masica, 1993).

50|$|The {{settlement}} at {{the river}} mouth is significant particularly in {{its relationship with the}} Royal Burgh of Elgin. An argument between Alexander Bur, Bishop of Moray and John Dunbar, 4th Earl of Moray was documented in 1383 regarding the ‘ownership’ <b>of</b> the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> ‘Losey’. This document mentions that Losey was commonly known to fall within the limits of the episcopal estates. The Bishop’s description <b>of</b> the <b>port</b> suggests that it was well downstream from his fishing station at Spynie. It seems likely, therefore to look upon Losey as not merely a fishing station but as a trading port that the Elgin Burgesses used as a counterbalance to the Royal Burgh <b>of</b> Forres's trading <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Findhorn. The dispute with the Earl of Moray went further. That same year of 1383, the Earl wrote to the Elgin burgesses offering them the use <b>of</b> his <b>port</b> at the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the River Spey with no duties in an attempt to take trade from the Bishop.
