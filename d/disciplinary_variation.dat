40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the question of}} <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variation</b> by focusing on {{a few of the}} ways voice operates in academic discourse. In it I take the position that while all academic discourse actively endeavors to convey knowledge persuasively, such conveyance often differs considerably across disciplines. Attempting to ascertain what these differences may be and how they work to create what disciplinary communities ‘know’ is anything but a merely formal question of stylistics. It tells us something about how knowledge is created and disseminated in and around academia and how beliefs are justified within these socially and culturally defined contexts...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a 3 year research project which investigated <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variation</b> in student writing. Within an Open University course in the history of science, students from an arts background were found to achieve significantly higher grades than those from a science background. Textual and interview data suggest that differences in their essay writing may be related to differences in disciplinary culture and epistemology. The results thus support the hypothesis that students’ writing is shaped by their disciplinary background, and call into question the extent to which communication skills are transferable across disciplinary contexts...|$|E
30|$|This {{study has}} {{examined}} the SoP genre’s potential <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variations</b> in lexico-grammatical and rhetorical features. Following a corpus-driven, bottom-up analytical procedure, the study has revealed a somewhat surprising picture, finding that there are noticeable differences between SoPs written for the Arts division and those written for the Science division. Thus, while this study has provided further empirical evidence to define the SoP as an academic self-promotional genre, it has also offered several valuable insights of the SoP genre’s <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variations</b> in textual regularity.|$|R

This paper thus aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion on the SoP genre via an exploratory corpus-driven study of the genre’s potential <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variations.</b> The broader theoretical and pedagogical concerns of the study lie in the growing prevalence of promotional genres in academic writing and their potential pedagogical values for English as an additional language (EAL) writing instruction.|$|R

The present study aimed to explore the rhetorical moves of abstracts {{in the fields of}} linguistics and applied linguistics by investigating 200 abstracts published between 2009 - 2012. Hyland’s (2000) model of five rhetorical moves was chosen as the analytical framework for the rhetorical structure.

30|$|There {{have been}} two {{analytical}} focuses within the previous research on SoPs. The first analytical focus is the textual regulations of the SoP genre. Most of the previous studies on the SoP genre have adopted move-structural analysis to explore its prototypical rhetorical move structure. One common finding emerging from these studies is that the SoP genre involves four essential moves (introduction, relevant background, reasons for applying and conclusion) and one optional move (extra-curricular information or career goal) (Ding, 2007; Samraj & Monk, 2008; Chiu, 2016). Meanwhile, the previous research also suggests noticeable <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variations</b> in terms of which move should be SoP writers’ primary focus. The comparative analysis by Samraj and Monk (2008) found that while SoPs written for three disciplines (electronic engineering, linguistics and business administration) are identical {{in terms of their}} general rhetorical moves, they differ across disciplines in the associated steps: in their SoP corpus, SoPs written for electronic engineering paid much more attention to the “step of research focus” in contrast to their counterparts written for linguistics and business administration. Chiu (2016) further attributes such <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variations</b> to SoP writers’ sense of writer positioning, target audience and the writing process.|$|R

40|$|In our pragmatic {{approach}} to research articles (RAs), {{we take a}} look at one of the main characteristics of academic writing: the use of modalized statements. Modalization, in the form of modal verbs, has been extensively studied by ESP researchers and practitioners. Most of their studies, however, have slightly touched upon the distinction between epistemic modality, which questions the certainty or probability of a statement, and deontic modality, which lays obligations or gives permission to the audience. This dichotomy is an important tool to describe <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variations</b> in academic and professional writing. We contend that different disciplines favor different types of modality. Results in this study indicate that health science RAs mostly use epistemic modality, whereas literary criticism RAs combine the use of both epistemic and deontic modality...|$|R

To this end, the composition of the wh-clauses was analysed for its main constituents (subjects, verb phrases and modality) and the clefts were grouped according to their apparent main function and subfunction within the lecture discourse.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a corpus-based {{analysis of the}} distribution of the high-frequency collocates of abstract nouns in 320 research articles across eight disciplines: Chemistry, Computer Science, Materials Science, Neuroscience, Economics, Language and Linguistics, Management, and Psychology. <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>variation</b> was also examined – very little previous research seems to have investigated this. The corpus was analysed using WordSmith Tools. The 16 highest-frequency nouns across all eight disciplines were identified, followed by the highest-frequency collocates for each noun. Five disciplines showed over 50 % variance from the overall results. Conclusions are that the differing patterns revealed are disciplinary norms and represent standard terminology within the disciplines arising from the topics discussed, research methods, and content of discussions. It is also concluded that the collocations {{are an important part of}} the meanings and functions of the nouns, and that this evidence of sharp discipline differences underlines the importance of discipline-specific collocation research...|$|E
40|$|A new metric, “stickiness,” is proposed, {{tracking}} longitudinally {{all students}} who have contact with a discipline to determine the likelihood those students will “stick” to that discipline and graduate in it. This metric has the versatility to be relevant for students making contact with engineering {{through a variety of}} pathways. Stickiness exhibits significant disciplinary differentiation. Whereas earlier work has shown that Industrial Engineering is the most successful at attracting and retaining students, the disciplinary distribution of stickiness shows that Industrial Engineering is exceptional. Disaggregating by race/ethnicity and gender, much larger variations in stickiness are observed (as much as 48 percent), and positive and negative outcomes are identified where students in particular subpopulations are more or less likely to stick than expected. Aggregated by race/ethnicity and gender, the stickiness of transfer students ranks the disciplines in the same order as the stickiness of first-time-in-college students, but transfer stickiness exhibits less <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variation</b> and transfer students in all disciplines exhibit higher stickiness than first-time-in-college students...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} component of fluent linguistic production is control of the multi-word expressions referred to as clusters, chunks or bundles. These are extended collocations which appear more frequently than expected by chance, helping to shape meanings in specific contexts and contributing to our sense of coherence in a text. Bundles have begun to attract considerable attention in corpus studies in EAP, although {{the extent to which}} they differ by discipline remains an open question. This paper explores the forms, structures and functions of 4 -word bundles in a 3. 5 million word corpus of research articles, doctoral dissertations and Master’s theses in four disciplines to learn something of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variations</b> in their frequencies and preferred uses. The analysis shows that bundles are not only central to the creation of academic discourse, but that they offer an important means of differentiating written texts by discipline...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCorpus-based genre {{analysis}} studies {{not only}} describe the lexico-grammatical, discoursal and rhetorical features of academic writing in various disciplines but also reveal how these features change over time. In this respect, findings obtained through academic genre research potentially generate new pedagogical proposals {{or at least}} lead to a critical review of current practices in EAP writing programs. However, guidelines presented in academic writing manuals rarely respond to <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variations</b> revealed by research studies and are rarely based on analysis of authentic texts, actual practice and scientific evidence. A review of corpus-based genre analysis studies suggests that rhetorical aspects of academic writing such as authorial identity markers, citations and rhetorical moves have received considerable attention recently.

40|$|ABSTRACT Recent {{advances}} {{in information technology}} have enabled new ways of communicating research reports. A significant innovation {{in this area is}} that of ‘eprint ’ archives: online repositories in which researchers make their papers freely available to their colleagues. This practice, which is known as self-archiving, poses a serious challenge to traditional academic journals. Publishers have responded with several strategies for remodelling journals in order to make them more attractive to authors and readers. New services, products and initiatives are constantly being launched in this market, and the outcome of the present disruption is uncertain. The present paper employs the Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) methodology to analyse the current transformation in scholarly communication. The analysis defines the functions long served by academic publishing, examines the extent to which newly introduced technologies fulfil these functions and explains the dynamics of the stabilization process now underway. A key element of the analysis is the principle of interpretative flexibility. In the present case, interpretative flexibility brings into relief <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variation</b> in the needs and interests of potential users...|$|E
40|$|Data {{from the}} 1984 Carnegie survey of faculty at U. S. {{universities}} show substantial <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variation</b> in perceptions that one's field is stagnant. We examine {{the extent to}} which variation in pessimism about the intellectual state of one's field can be explained by theories that attribute it to field-level variation in anomie and consensus. We also examine the effects of individual-level characteristics on disciplinary discontent using a multilevel analysis. We find that both anomie and consensus exert strong effects on the average levels of scholarly pessimism within fields. In addition, there is an interaction effect involving the level of consensus in a field and whether the field is primarily pure or applied. The multilevel analysis shows that the effects of field-level variables are not attributable to compositional differences in individual characteristics and that, as a group, the field-level variables are stronger determinants of scholarly pessimism than individual characteristics. Scholars often dismiss research in a particular discipline, specialty, or sub-specialty as unproductive, describing such fields as "stagnant, " "in th...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} focus {{within the}} teaching of academic writing in HE is on language produced as linear prose within genres such as the essay, report or case study.

30|$|Studies further {{exploring}} {{the relationships between}} general learning strategy use and academic disciplines have suggested that students in different majors tend to choose different strategies. For example, Chang (1991) reported that EAL students in the {{humanities and social sciences}} generally reported using more strategies than did science majors. Mochizuki (1999) suggested that academic subject was a key variable associated with choice of strategies reported by Japanese university students. The largest study investigating this variable to date has been that of Peacock and Ho (2003) involving over 1000 university EAP (English for academic purposes) students in Hong Kong across eight disciplines. The results also suggested <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variations</b> in strategy use, prompting the researchers to propose discipline-specific strategy training. Ann and Nathalang’s (2010) study involved Chinese first-year undergraduate students from the arts and sciences at a Chinese university; although devoid of observed strategy use owing to data collection methods, the study similarly revealed differences in strategies between learners from the two disciplines.|$|R
30|$|This paper explores <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variations</b> in {{academic}} promotional writing via a comparative analysis of statements of purpose (SoPs) written for different disciplines. A total of 100 SoPs written by English {{as an additional}} language (EAL) applicants from mainland China were collected, which were drawn from five academic disciplines: business, engineering, humanities, science and social science. Following a corpus-driven research design, these SoP samples were analyzed {{in terms of their}} lexico-grammatical and rhetorical features. The data analysis suggests that although on the surface these SoP samples share similarities in lexico-grammatical and rhetorical features, they are quite different in terms of their preferred persuasion strategies. While SoPs written for engineering and science primarily base their self-promotional arguments upon the applicants’ previous research experiences and future research prospects, those written for business, humanities and social science tend to focus on how the applicants’ unique Chinese socio-cultural backgrounds would contribute to their desired programs. The above finding sheds light upon how academic genres are invariably embedded in disciplinary practices, with each discipline having its own communicative purposes, discourse community members, academic expectations and disciplinary constraints.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variation</b> in academic writing, focusing in particular on the use of adjective patterns followed by prepositions. The analysis proceeds through a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of these patterns in two large corpora of authentic texts. The analysis focuses not only on the specific adjectives found in the patterns themselves, but also on collocations within and around each pattern. The empirical focus of the study will be on two ‘soft-applied’ disciplines (Becher and Trowler 2001), applied linguistics and business studies, as represented by two corpora of research articles drawn from 16 leading journals in each field. Comparison of the results for each corpus shows that there are many differences in form and meaning between the two disciplines: it is argued that the features revealed by my analysis are indicative of the epistemological characteristics of these two different disciplinary discourses. These differences reveal the particular culture and norm of applied linguistics and business studies. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of the British Academic Written English (BAWE) project, which aims to {{characterize}} student writing across 28 disciplines and four years of study, this chapter focuses on describing what university students write about, or ideational meaning. It focuses on Field, for example on whether students write about people, ideas or scientific entities, and more specifically on Angle on Field (Martin 1993), for example whether these are construed as phenomena (Mohandas Ghandi) or as metaphenomena (Approaches to the study of eminence). Building on insights from studies of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variation</b> and progression, and of the nature of Sentence Subjects, an analytical framework is developed. Comparison with findings from studies of professional academic writing from English, History, Psychology, (Macdonald 1994), Science, (Gosden 1993), Economics and Business (Lewin, Fine and Young 2001) demonstrates the potential for Sentence Subject analysis of student writing. Detailed description of the planned 3000 assignments in the BAWE corpus {{is beyond the scope of}} the project; thus the focus narrows to mapping Assignment Initial Sentence Subjects.

30|$|As {{for the use}} of {{communication}} strategies vis-à-vis disciplines, contrary to previous findings, our results detected no statistically significant differences between the EE and ED participants in any of the eight strategy categories. Yet the lack of statistical significance is not equivalent to a lack of practical significance (Huang, 2013). As Alderson (2004) pointed out, “Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence” (p. 476). This lack of statistical differences therefore {{does not necessarily mean that}} the results are not important or have no meaningful implications in reality. We did, however, detect a significant difference in individual strategies regarding use of clarifying stances between the EE and ED participants, with significantly greater use of this strategy by the ED group (Xu, 2017). This difference may be related to <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variations</b> in the kinds of writing and speaking tasks that learners in education often engage in. In addition, during the debates the ED learners, unlike the EE learners, did not share the same interpretations of the topic, which necessitated clarifying their stances in advancing their viewpoints.|$|R

Barnett (2000 : 257) argues that universities need {{to prepare students for}} ‘supercomplexity’, where “the very frameworks by which we orientate ourselves to the world are themselves contested”. Learning to think through ethical issues develops critical thinking skills for dealing with supercomplexity, since the frameworks students use to consider ethical issues are contested and likely to change. This research explores <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variations</b> in the development of undergraduates’ ethical thinking during their programmes and compares how this aligns with the expectations of their tutors. Interviews were conducted with tutors teaching on the English, Geography and Animal Behaviour and Welfare programmes at an English University and a questionnaire was completed by 335 students studying on these programmes.

30|$|Statements {{of purpose}} (SoPs), {{also known as}} {{personal}} statements, are self-narrative essays required by the graduate application processes of most universities in the West. The SoP {{is arguably the most}} significant piece of writing during the transition between undergraduate and graduate studies since it is often the only discursive space among the required graduate application documents that is fully controlled by the applicant. Nevertheless, the SoP remarkably differs from other academic genres mainly produced by undergraduate writers: it tends to be a fairly short, personal and open-ended text with considerable <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variations</b> (Chiu, 2015, 2016; Samraj & Monk, 2008). Even within the same discipline, different graduate programs may vary in criteria for evaluating submitted SoPs. Such program-specific information is often opaque, which, combined with the fact that authentic samples of successful SoPs are not readily accessible to prospective SoP writers, makes the SoP a “semi-occluded” genre (Samraj & Monk, 2008; Swales, 1996). Consequently, many graduate applicants consider SoP writing as an exceedingly daunting task and this challenge has been further intensified by the lack of institutional support for SoP writing at many universities (Dubb, 2011).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the major generic structures of empirical research articles (RAs), with a particular focus on <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variation</b> and the relationship between the adjacent sections in the introductory and concluding parts. The findings were derived from a close " manual" analysis of 433 recent empirical RAs from high-impact English-language journals in 39 disciplines in the fields of engineering, applied sciences, social sciences and the humanities. This analysis reveals that while many empirical RAs follow the " standard" Introduction-Method-Results-Discussion (IMRD) pattern, this structure is not the default option for organizing such studies. The findings indicate that the most frequently used structural pattern is Introduction-Literature Review-Method-Results and Discussion-Conclusion (ILM[RD]C). The other prominent patterns found in the corpus are IM[RD]C, IMRDC, ILMRDC and ILMRD. The paper identifies and highlights the importance of the sections that are not fully accounted for in the conventional IMRD framework, namely the Literature Review (L), the merged (as opposed to separated) Results and Discussion [RD], and the Conclusion (C). The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the study for academic writing research as well as the design of RA writing courses and materials for research students and early-career academics.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a corpus-based analysis {{of variation in}} the distribution and function of modals and {{their role in the}} expression of “stance ” in a corpus of 600 research articles (RAs) across twelve disciplines. Stance is an expression of attitudes, judgments, or assessments towards the truth of propositions (Biber et al., 1999), and part of the important function of claiming and confirming membership of discourse communities and therefore in constructing identity. Three functional categories of modals perform a valuable role in the construction of stance: Possibility/Ability, Obligation/Necessity, and Prediction (Biber et al., 1999). However, very little research seems to have investigated variation across disciplines or their use in the RA. The corpus was analysed using WordSmith Tools (Scott, 2004), followed by manual checking of the function of every occurrence. Inter- and intra-rater agreement was also checked. Many statistically significant disciplinary differences were found, along with numerous marked differences with individual modals. Further examination of the corpus revealed considerable <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variation</b> in the patterns and verbs associated with the target modals, and a number of sub-functions of the topics covered by the modals. Conclusions are that modals perform {{an important role in the}} construction of stance...|$|E

Multiple-group structural equation modelling analysis showed configural invariance of the hypothesised model, suggesting a common model of good teaching across disciplines; and significant differences in the magnitude of structural paths and latent mean values across the four disciplinary groups were obtained reflecting differences between disciplines in the extent to which elements within the teaching and learning environment were brought into play.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{interpersonal}} features of academic texts, through which writers evaluate their material and engage their readers, {{has been one}} of the most productive areas of discourse studies of the past decade. Scholarly writing involves adopting a position and persuading readers of claims, and the linguistic resources used to achieve these goals have been described in terms of evaluation, stance and metadiscourse. A relatively overlooked interpersonal feature however is what we shall call evaluative that constructions, a structure which allows a writer to thematize attitudinal meanings and present an explicit statement of evaluation by presenting a complement clause within a super-ordinate clause. In this paper we explore the <b>disciplinary</b> <b>variations</b> in the frequencies, forms and functions of evaluative that structures in 240 research article abstracts from six disciplines. We find that this structure is widely employed in these abstracts, about once every five sentences, and is an important means of providing author comment and evaluation.

40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} study using a corpus of lecture {{introductions}} {{to explore the}} generic features of the language used. The main research questions: What are the main communicative functions of this sub-genre? How are the functions realised? Are there any disciplinary differences in university lecture introductions? are explored using two complementary methods of analysis; genre analysis and corpus analysis. Analysis of eighty-nine lecture introductions from the BASE corpus 1 resulted in a Lecture Introduction Framework which posits a two-level classification which first differentiates lecture content orientation (Thompson, 1994) versus listener orientation (Dubois, 1980). This yields three main functions, with additional sub-functions original to this study. The study reveals differences {{in the frequency of}} different sub-functions in the four disciplinary domains, reflecting different disciplinary cultures and knowledge. The corpus analysis generated a word frequency list for lecture introductions, giving a rich linguistic description of the lexis used. Further analysis on one of the three main functions; the Set Up Lecture Framework Function uses WordSmith Tools 5 to analyse the linguistic realisations of the three subfunctions, which are also the top three most used sub-functions in the corpus.
