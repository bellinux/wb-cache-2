40|$|Pigeons {{were trained}} on a {{multiple}} schedule {{in which two}} <b>target</b> <b>components</b> with identical reinforcement schedules were followed by either the same-valued schedule or by extinction. Response rate increased in both <b>target</b> <b>components</b> but was higher in the <b>target</b> <b>component</b> followed by extinction, replicating previous findings of positive anticipatory contrast. A similar design was used to study negative contrast, in that the two <b>target</b> <b>components</b> were followed either by the same-valued schedule or by a higher valued schedule. Negative contrast occurred equally, on average, in both <b>target</b> <b>components,</b> thus failing to demonstrate negative contrast that is specifically anticipatory in nature. When the stimuli correlated with the two <b>target</b> <b>components</b> were paired in choice tests, the pattern of preference was in the opposite direction. For the positive contrast procedure, no significant preference between the two target stimuli was evident. But for the negative contrast procedure, preference favored the stimulus followed by the higher valued schedule. The results demonstrate a functional dissociation between positive and negative contrast in relation to stimulus value. More generally, the results demonstrate an inverse relation between response rate and preference and challenge existing accounts of contrast {{in terms of the}} concept of relative value...|$|R

An example is the following: exact address of the <b>target</b> <b>item</b> is given by a sequence of many bits, but we need to know only some of them. More generally partial search considers the following problem: a database is separated into several blocks.

30|$|Communication {{based on}} intents {{can be with}} or without the <b>target</b> <b>component</b> name in intent. If a target name is {{included}} in the intent (explicit intent), Android system passes on the intent to the <b>target</b> <b>component.</b> Inter-component communication using explicit intent is straight forward and is not included in this work. To address a component using an intent without the <b>target</b> <b>component</b> name (implicit intent), a general action is declared and the target is resolved by the Android system (runtime). The type of action in implicit intent, to be performed by a component, enables the system to find a set of appropriate components for that action. Finding the <b>target</b> <b>component</b> for an implicit intent is complicated: the system takes the intent’s data and looks for an appropriate set of components in the applications available on the mobile device. In case only one appropriate component is found, the system start that component, however, for more options, the system asks the user using a dialogue to choose from the list.|$|R
40|$|A typical {{situation}} in preparative chromatography {{is that a}} certain <b>target</b> <b>component</b> elutes {{somewhere in the middle}} of a train of other components present in the feed. In order to isolate efficiently this <b>target</b> <b>component</b> the operating conditions of conventional batch chromatography have to be optimized carefully. Nevertheless, the achievable production rates and recovery yields are frequently low. Recently a possible alternative was suggested [1] based on using batch chromatography just as a first step providing fractions where the <b>target</b> <b>component</b> has the highest or lowest retention time. Subsequently, these fractions could be processed using continuous countercurrent chromatography in order to isolate the <b>target</b> <b>component.</b> Such a coupled process is analyzed theoretically for the case of linear adsorption isotherms. Based on results of simulations using a) the ideal model of chromatography and b) the equilibrium dispersive model it is demonstrated that the coupled process arrangement could possess advantages, compared to the application of batch chromatography alone.

Unlike corresponding experiments previously reported with pigeons, higher response rates occurred in the <b>target</b> <b>component</b> followed by a higher valued schedule than in the <b>target</b> <b>component</b> followed by the lower valued schedule. Overall contrast effects occurred independently of these sequential effects, but were inconsistent across subjects. The results suggest that the effects of a following schedule of reinforcement are opposite for pigeons and rats, and that one reason previous studies have often failed to show contrast effects with rats is that the effects of the following schedule in rats are in competition with contrast dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{applicability}} of the entropy method for the trend towards equilibrium for reaction-diffusion systems arising from first order chemical reaction networks is studied. In particular, we present a suitable entropy structure for weakly reversible reaction networks without detail balance condition. We show by deriving an entropy-entropy dissipation estimate that for any weakly reversible network each solution trajectory converges exponen-tially fast to the unique positive equilibrium with computable rates. This convergence is shown to be true even in cases when the diffusion coefficients all but one species are zero. For non-weakly reversible networks consisting of source, transmission and <b>target</b> <b>components,</b> it is shown that species belonging to a source or trans-mission component decay to zero exponentially fast while species belonging to a <b>target</b> <b>component</b> converge to the corresponding positive equilibria, which are determined by the dynamics of the <b>target</b> <b>component</b> and the mass injected from other components.

We define a target class {{as a set of}} contiguous target-sensor orientations over which the associated image is relatively invariant, or statistically stationary. Given an image from an unknown target, the objective is proper target-class association (target identity and pose). Our principal contribution is an image classifier in which a distinct set of templates is designed for each image class, with templates linked to the object sub-components, and the associated statistics are characterized via a hidden Markov model. In particular, we employ expansion matching (EXM) filters to identify the presence of the <b>target</b> <b>components</b> in the image, and use a hidden Markov tree (HMT) to characterize the statistics of the correlation of the image with the various templates. We achieve a successful classification rate of 92 % on a data set of FLIR vehicle images, compared with 72 % for a previously developed wavelet-feature-based HMT technique...|$|R
