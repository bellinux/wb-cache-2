5|$|By 1962, the American {{government}} was becoming increasingly concerned {{at the lack}} of a commitment from Canada to take nuclear weapons. The interceptors and Bomarc missiles with which Canada was being supplied as a NORAD member were either of no use or of greatly diminished utility without nuclear devices. Canadian and American military officers launched a quiet campaign to make this known to the press, and to advocate for Canadian agreement to acquire the warheads. Diefenbaker was also upset when Pearson was invited to the White <b>House</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> dinner for Nobel Prize winners in April, and met with the President privately for 40 minutes. When the Prime Minister met with retiring American Ambassador Livingston Merchant, he angrily disclosed the paper Kennedy had left behind, and hinted that he might make use of it in the upcoming election campaign. Merchant's report caused consternation in Washington, and the ambassador was sent back to see Diefenbaker again. This time, he found Diefenbaker calm, and the Prime Minister pledged not to use the memo, and to give Merchant advance word if he changed his mind. Canada appointed a new ambassador to Washington, Charles Ritchie, who on arrival received a cool reception from Kennedy and found that the squabble was affecting progress on a number of issues.|$|E

Grace's mother had given the couple a large <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wedding present, which Louis mortgaged {{in an attempt to}} save his father's newspaper from bankruptcy. The Sun was nonetheless sold, and Louis fired in 1901, though he soon after successfully begged to return to his job. Louis continued working as a freelancer for the Herald; one of his most notable stories was to interview Vice President Theodore Roosevelt on his return to Washington, D.C. after the death of President William McKinley. During this period, Grace went to live with her mother, where she gave birth to the couple's first child, Mary.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, when Roddenberry {{was twelve}} years old, {{the family moved to}} 4906 Monte Vista in the shadow of Mount Washington, and he began {{attending}} Luther Burbank Junior High School. This was the house that Roddenberry would later describe as his childhood home. His father helped the boys obtain local jobs; Gene worked as a newspaper delivery boy and as a gas station attendant on Saturdays, and after school. The young Roddenberry moved to Franklin High School during the middle years of the Great Depression. His father was relatively unaffected by the Great Depression because of his stable employment with the police department. The family distributed food to friends and family who were in need. Glen's parents and her younger sister Willodean moved into the <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time before finding other accommodation in Redondo Beach.

The kitchen was part of the magnificent abbot's house begun under Abbot John de Breynton (1334–42). It {{is one of the best}} preserved medieval kitchens in Europe, and the only substantial monastic building surviving at Glastonbury. Archaeological excavations have revealed a special apartment erected at the south end of the abbot's <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> visit from Henry VII, who visited the abbot in a royal progress, as he visited any other great territorial magnate. The conditions of life in England during the Wars of the Roses became so unsettled that a wall was built around the abbey's precincts.|$|E

In addition, to replace the student accommodation that {{the demolition}} would remove, the plan was for another building containing 64 student flats plus staff accommodation to be constructed on {{the eastern part of the}} site.
