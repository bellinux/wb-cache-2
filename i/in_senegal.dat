5|$|French Sudan {{originally}} {{formed as}} a set of military outposts {{as an extension of the}} French colony <b>in</b> <b>Senegal.</b> Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region. This was partly due to a fascination with the great empires, such as the Mali Empire and the Songhay Empire that rose to prominence in the area, and partly due to the promotional opportunities that military conquest offered for French military personnel.|$|E
5|$|Habré {{consolidated}} his dictatorship {{through a}} power system that relied on corruption and violence {{with thousands of}} people estimated to have been killed under his rule. The president favoured his own Toubou ethnic group and discriminated against his former allies, the Zaghawa. His general, Idriss Déby, overthrew him in 1990. Attempts to prosecute Habré led to his placement under house arrest <b>in</b> <b>Senegal</b> in 2005; in 2013, Habré was formally charged with war crimes committed during his rule.

5|$|Wax {{resist dyeing}} of fabric {{is an ancient}} art form. It already existed in Egypt in the 4th century BC, where {{it was used to}} wrap mummies; linen was soaked in wax, and {{scratched}} using a stylus. In Asia, the technique was practised in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), and in India and Japan during the Nara Period (645-794 AD). In Africa it was originally practised by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria, Soninke and Wolof <b>in</b> <b>Senegal.</b> These African version however, uses cassava starch or rice paste, or mud as a resist instead of beeswax.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, the French army {{ceased to}} use the Mérens for drawing {{artillery}} in the mountains, and this corresponded {{to the beginning of}} the decline of the breed. The population fell dramatically during the second half of the 20th century, due to the modernization and mechanization of transport and agriculture. In 1950 <b>in</b> <b>Senegal,</b> the Mérens was used in attempts to create a horse tougher than the native M'Bayar, but the breeding program was not enough to significantly increase the Mérens population. The use of the Mérens in agriculture continued into the 1970s, and like many French draft breeds, it was also bred for slaughter to produce horse meat. The mountains of Ariege acted as a sanctuary, preventing the Mérens, as well as other breeds such as Gascon cattle and Tarasconnaise sheep, from disappearing completely. By the early 1970s, however, the Mérens was on the verge of extinction.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the group}} {{performed}} at a music festival {{held by the}} Dakar French Cultural Center, where the French rapper MC Solaar heard their performance and invited the group to open {{for him when he}} debuted in Dakar in October of that year. The rapper was impressed with Positive Black Soul, inviting them to continue performing with him in France. Two years later the group put out its first release, a cassette entitled Boul Falé. The album was followed by more touring in France, as well as in England and Switzerland. In the same year, the Senegalese musician Baaba Maal offered PBS the opportunity to be on his album Firin' in Fouta. Maal was signed to Mango Records and because of this recording with him, Positive Black Soul were signed as well. They released their album debut Salaam on Mango Records. After achieving success <b>in</b> <b>Senegal</b> and some abroad, the group continued touring, including 130 performances in 1997. They also began organizing concerts in Dakar and promoting new groups including Daara J and Pee Froiss.|$|E

5|$|In Africa, where batik was {{originally}} imported by Dutch merchants from Indonesia (then the Netherlands East Indies), paste made from starch or mud {{is used as}} a resist instead of wax. The most developed resist-dyeing skills {{are to be found in}} Nigeria where the Yoruba make adire cloths. Two methods of resist are used: adire eleso which involves tied and stitched designs and adire eleko that uses starch paste. The paste is most often made from cassava starch, rice, and other ingredients boiled together to produce a smooth thick paste. The Yoruba of West Africa use cassava paste as a resist while the Soninke and Wolof people <b>in</b> <b>Senegal</b> uses rice paste. The Bamana people of Mali use mud as a resist.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1959, {{there were}} {{plans for a}} {{federation}} linking the Sudanese Republic with Senegal, Dahomey, and the Upper Volta in a federation of autonomous states. By April, however, neither Dahomey's nor Upper Volta's legislatures had ratified the federation, and so the Mali Federation was formed with only the Sudanese Republic and Senegal. In 1959, Modibo Keïta's RDA party won all 70 seats in the legislative elections in the Sudanese Republic and joined forces with the dominant party <b>in</b> <b>Senegal,</b> headed by Léopold Sédar Senghor. The federation achieved independence on 20 June 1960 within the French Community; however, divisions between Senghor and Keïta on the governance of the federation resulted in its dissolution on 20 August 1960. The area of French Sudan formally proclaimed itself the Republic of Mali and, with increasing radicalization of Keita, left the French Community in September 1960.|$|E
5|$|Increasing upper-level {{westerlies}} caused Alberto {{to weaken}} {{as it moved}} east-northeastward, with the cyclone losing most of its convection. Early on August14, Alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm. A westerly trough that had been guiding Alberto outran the storm, and strong ridging developed {{to the north and}} west. As a result, Alberto turned southward on August15, southwestward on August16, and then to the west on August17. While curving northwestward and then northward, Alberto began to re-strengthen, and was upgraded to a hurricane for a third time on August18. Alberto reached a third peak intensity as a Category2 hurricane with winds of 105mph (205km/h) on August20. After weakening back to a Category1 hurricane, Alberto conducted an unusually large cyclonic loop, spanning approximately 5degrees latitude and 8degrees longitude. The cyclone was downgraded to a tropical storm on August23, shortly before completing its extratropical transition. Although it did not affect land while tropical, the precursor tropical wave caused light rainfall <b>in</b> <b>Senegal.</b> The remnant extratropical cyclone also likely produced tropical storm-force winds in Iceland and Jan Mayen.|$|E

5|$|It {{is highly}} gregarious on migration, {{travelling}} in large flocks that can contain {{hundreds or thousands}} of individuals. Huge dense groups form on the wintering grounds; one flock <b>in</b> <b>Senegal</b> contained a million birds. A minority winter further east to Burma, south China, New Guinea and scattered parts of southern Australia, or on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Europe. In Great Britain and parts of coastal western Europe, where the breeding and wintering ranges overlap, birds may be present throughout the year. Non-breeding birds may also remain year round in the tropical wintering quarters. The Ruff is an uncommon visitor to Alaska (where it has occasionally bred), Canada and the contiguous states of the US, and has wandered to Iceland, Middle America, northern South America, Madagascar and New Zealand. It has been recorded as breeding well south of its main range in northern Kazakhstan, a major migration stopover area.|$|E
5|$|John Latham {{wrote about}} the bird found in Calcutta based on {{descriptions}} in Ives's Voyage to India published in 1773 and included an illustration in the first supplement to his General Synopsis of Birds. The illustration {{was based on a}} drawing in Lady Impey's collection and Latham called it the gigantic crane and included observations by an African traveller named Smeathman who described a similar bird from western Africa. Johann Friedrich Gmelin used Latham's description and described the Indian bird as Ardea dubia in 1789 while Latham later used the name Ardea argala for the Indian bird. Temminck used the name Ciconia marabou in 1824 based on the local name used <b>in</b> <b>Senegal</b> for the African bird and this was also applied to the Indian species. This led to considerable confusion between the African and Indian species. The marabou stork of Africa looks somewhat similar but their disjunct distribution ranges, differences in bill structure, plumage, and display behaviour support their treatment as separate species.|$|E
5|$|Now an {{established}} Premier League club, Bolton signed veteran internationals Gary Speed and Fernando Hierro, aged 35 and 36 respectively. Speed and Hierro went into midfield, while Tunisia international Radhi Jaïdi was played at centre-back after arriving on a free transfer from Espérance; he was played alongside another new arrival, Israel defender Tal Ben Haim, who was recommended by Allardyce's son Craig. He also brought <b>in</b> <b>Senegal</b> striker El Hadji Diouf on a season-long loan from Liverpool, who he would eventually sign permanently for £3million. After {{a good start}} to the season, Allardyce was offered the Newcastle United job, but turned it down and instead signed a new five-year contract with Bolton as he felt the Bolton squad to be more talented.
