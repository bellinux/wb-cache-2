40|$|Although {{significant}} {{scholarship has}} been devoted to Hong Kong martial arts cinema in recent decades, with emphasis on King Hu and Change Cheh as key creative figures, relatively little attention {{has been devoted}} to Chor Yuen, who directed over forty-seven feature films for the Shaw Brothers studio between 1971 and 1985, most of them in the wuxia genre. In this paper I argue that a critical investigation of Chor Yuen’s work through an auteurist lens reveals a director with a distinct vision and formal sensibility, and encourages a reconsideration of his role in shaping the development of the genre. Through a reading of Chor Yuen’s directorial style and his ludic deployment of Chinese cultural tropes in his wuxia films, this paper will illustrate how these produce a form of reflexive and self-orientalizing cinema that both affirmed and subverted the 'dream of China' proffered by Shaw Brothers to the Chinese diaspora. By heightening the factitious, orientalist dimension of this nostalgic production, Chor <b>interrupted</b> its <b>capacity</b> to work in pure ideologically nationalistic terms. Communicating this transmuted ‘dream’ forward, influencing future directors and variations of the genre, Chor Yuen has contributed meaningfully both to the development of Hong Kong’s cultural hybridity, and to promoting new, essentialized, mobile permutations of ‘Chineseness. ...|$|R

Here, we report that oncogenic K-Ras, but not H-Ras, suppresses non-canonical Wnt/Ca 2 + signaling, an effect that contributes strongly to its tumorigenic properties. K-Ras does this by binding to calmodulin and so reducing CaMKii activity and expression of Fzd 8.

Both the step response and the steady-state performance verify the accuracy of the model.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{application}} of molecular biology {{to the discovery}} of novel pathways to inhibit allergic tissue responses is becoming a reality. Particularly promising approaches are the use of vaccines and pharmacologic agents to downregulate the polarized T Helper (Th) - 2 lymphocyte response through enhancement of interferon-y production. Selective inhibition of specific mediators, such as interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 5, IL- 13 and eotaxin, should lead to a new class of anticytokine therapeutic agents. At the cellular level, more effective inhibition of mast cell activation and strategies to remove IgE as the triggering stimulus hold promise. With the discovery of susceptibility genes for allergic disease, the next decade is likely to witness substantial further developments in this field, with a strong focus targeted on induction mechanisms and disease prevention. If the current epidemic of allergic disease continues, then there is a strong incentive to identify those environmental factors that are responsible so that appropriate interventions can be introduced. These may include alterations to the maternal and infant diet to program the developing immune response or, in genetically susceptible individuals, the early introduction of a protective vaccine to reset the T lymphocyte balance more in favour of a Th- 1 response. In this regard, the development of cytosine and guanosine nucleotide repeats and antigen-specific DNA vaccines look especially promising. In established allergic disease, the task of reversing sensitization is daunting. Safer and more efficacious allergen vaccines, whether using DNA or peptide approaches, offer the most promising approach for fundamentally changing the allergic immune response. Patients would also greatly benefit from more effective and orally active mast cell inhibitors and small molecules that could either remove IgE or effectively <b>interrupt</b> its <b>capacity</b> to signal through its cell surface receptors. In the meantime, the epidemic of allergic disease requires urgent attention, not only in the provision of specialist centers for providing accurate diagnosis and for administering treatment (including immunotherapy), but in a clear recognition that these disorders are caused by changing environmental factors and, as a consequence, deserve attention at the level of public health...|$|R
40|$|Activation {{of central}} {{glucocorticoid}} receptors {{caused by the}} stress {{that is associated with}} a learning task facilitates storage of the acquired information. The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is entirely unknown. Glucocorticoid receptors can influence transcription both through DNA binding-dependent and -independent mechanisms. To assess the importance of these two modes of action for spatial memory, we here used male mutant mice in which homodimerization and DNA binding of the glucocorticoid receptor is largely prevented (GRdim/dim) while protein–protein interactions still can take place. These mice showed a selective impairment of spatial memory in the water maze. Locomotion and anxiety-related parameters measured in an open field and a light/dark preference task were comparable for mutant and control mice. Mutant mice released more corticosterone than control mice under basal resting conditions and in response to swimming, which could have influenced memory processes of the mice. However, mimicking the task-related increase in corticosterone by supplementary injection of corticosterone (250 μg/kg, i. p.) in adrenalectomized mice, resulting in equal plasma corticosterone concentrations in both genotypes, improved spatial memory of control mice but had no effect on mutant mice. These findings suggest that task-related facilitating effects of corticosterone on spatial memory indeed depend on DNA binding of the glucocorticoid receptor rather than on protein–protein interactions of the receptor with other transcription factors. Although it cannot be excluded that both processes are involved in a coordinated way, <b>interrupting</b> the DNA-binding <b>capacity</b> of the receptor is sufficient to induce impairment...|$|R
40|$|The {{global health}} {{community}} pays renewed attention to evaluating the feasi-bility of elimination and eradication of certain communicable diseases [1, 2] be-sides continuing {{to reduce the}} burden of ill-health. Eradication depends on both the availability of tools to <b>interrupt</b> transmis-sion, the <b>capacity</b> of health systems to implement these solutions effectively across all populations concerned, the required resources, and sustained political will. While the health and economic benefits of disease elimination and subse-quent eradication may be substantial, elimination initiatives represent resource-intensive efforts with associated opportu-nity costs [3, 4]. Given the increasingly intense competition for global health resources, the decision to commit to national/regional elimination or eventual global eradication initiatives needs to be based upon robust analysis of benefits, risks, and costs. Following an initial proposal of the Ernst Strüngmann Forum, convened in 2010 to explore the prospects, feasibility, and challenges of disease eradication [2], a working group developed a Guide to Preparing an Eradication Investment Case (EIC) [5]. The Guide proposes a generic approach applicable to any potentially eradicable disease. Among the diseases tentatively identi-fied as amenable to eradication are several neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) [6]. The vision of eliminating and eradicating selected NTDs has gathered momentum over recent years. In 2011, the WHO Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Neglected Tropical Diseases and its partners adopted a roadmap for the control, elimination, and eradication of many NTDs. The global financial support for NTDs control and elimination is still comparatively low but has recently started to substantially increase.

40|$|Natural {{disasters}} pose {{a growing}} {{threat to the}} development strategies of developing countries like Sri Lanka by destroying infrastructure and productive <b>capacity,</b> <b>interrupting</b> economic activity, and creating irreversible changes in the natural resource base. As Vermeiren (1993) says, with increasing frequency, countries are facing situations in which scarce resources that were earmarked for development projects have to be diverted to relief and reconstruction following disasters, thus setting back economic growth. Disasters also directly impact on the foreign exchange earnings capacity of a country, {{at a time when}} extra resources are needed to finance imports of food, energy, and inputs for the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. If sustainable development is to be achieved, countries will have to take effective measures to reduce their vulnerability to natural disasters. As a consequence, property insurance, the traditional mechanism for reducing economic risk from catastrophic events, is no longer as available or affordable as in the past. This development is now forcing property owners and developers to seriously look at other mechanisms to minimize the consequences of natural disasters. Time has come to practice disaster loss reduction in a systematic way, {{as an integral part of}} ongoing development planning and investment. The research community has produced a vast body of knowledge on structural and non-structural mitigation measures designed to prevent or reduce the impact of natural disasters. The problem is that this information remains to a large extent within the domain of the research community and its scientific papers. The challenge consists in translating this information into a format that can be understood by the development community, and in disseminating it to property owners, developers, and government planners. The benefits of long-term hazard mitigation go beyond economics, as the reduction in vulnerability to disasters contributes to individual security, social stability and sustainable development. Nevertheless, economic arguments built on a sound benefit-cost analysis are essential when one has to defend the use of scarce resources for investment in mitigation. In this paper, authors wish to share some of the findings from a study conducted on tsunami reconstruction in the East Coast of Sri Lanka...|$|R
40|$|A agressividade na infância tem sido apontada em pesquisas longitudinais como precursora da delinqüência na adolescência e da drogadependência na idade adulta. Sendo a infância um período mais propício a mudanças, procurou-se realizar intervenções em crianças apontadas por professores como muito agressivas no ambiente escolar. Neste trabalho, buscou-se estudar o processo ludoterapêutico a que foi submetida uma criança agressiva do sexo masculino, enfocando-se os fenômenos contratransferenciais. Foram realizados atendimentos semanais em uma sala com {{material}} lúdico específico para esta intervenção, ao longo de aproximadamente dois anos. Observou-se mudanças internas importantes na criança, sendo capaz de lidar melhor com perdas e de aceitar limites na relação com o outro. O que ampliou sua capacidade de relacionamento humano no âmbito social e escolar. No entanto, em muitos momentos, o contato com este menino foi angustiante e confuso para o terapeuta, em especial nas ocasiões em que a criança se mostrava muito agressiva. Ao término do processo psicoterápico, buscou-se compreender estas vivências angustiantes e confusas experimentadas durante os atendimentos. O que poderiam ser tais eventos e que sentidos teriam? Para abordar estas questões, utilizou-se, em especial, os referenciais teóricos de Melanie Klein, Donald Winnicott e Pierre Fédida, para abordar a agressividade e o processo transferencial/contratransferencial. Estes estudos puderam esclarecer o fato de que a intensidade e a violência do processo transferencial podem interromper a capacidade receptiva da contratransferência, ou seja, a possibilidade de ressonância, a abertura ao novo e ao inesperado e a possibilidade de linguagem do terapeuta nas sessões. E que a força desta transferência pode encontrar eco nos próprios conflitos inconscientes do terapeuta. Deixa-se como questão para futuros estudos, a hipótese de que o ataque à capacidade receptiva da contratransferência seja algo freqüente no trabalho clínico com uma criança agressiva e que este ataque possa se dar pela dificuldade de elaboração de lutos e de angústias depressivas. Aggressiveness {{in childhood}} has been pointed in longitudinal researches as precursor of delinquency during adolescence and drug addiction in adult age. Based {{on the fact}} that childhood is the fase of human development most likely to the occurence of changes, children who were considered aggressive by their teachers were submitted to interventions in the school environment. In the present study, the research was focused in the play therapy process to which an aggressive male child was submitted and its countertransference phenomena. Weekly sessions were held in a room equipped with specific playing material to this kind of intervention. The psychotherapy process lasted aproximatedly two years. Important internal changes were observed in the child, who was able to deal better with losses and accept limits on the relation with others. These changes improved his potential of establishing human relations in social environment, specially in school. Nevertheless, in many occasions, the therapist felt some kind of anxiety and confusion during his contact with the boy, more specifically in the moments when the child showed aggressive behavior. At the end of the psychotherapy process, an effort of understanding these anxious and confusing experience, which occurred during the sessions, was made. What sort of events those could be? What are their meanings, what sense could they make? In order to approach these questions, it was used theoretical references of some authors, such as Melanie Klein, Donald Winnicott and Pierre Fédida, focusing the aggressiveness and the transference/countertransference process. These studies were able to show clearly the fact that the intensity and the violence of the transferential process can <b>interrupt</b> the receptive <b>capacity</b> of countertranference, which can be exposed as the possibility of resonance, the opening to the new and unexpected and the possibility of the therapists language during the sessions. Also, the power of this transference can find echoes on the therapists own unconscious conflicts. The questions left for future studies are based on the hypothesis that the attack to the receptive capacity of countertransference happens frequently in an aggressive childs clinical treatment, and this attack can arise from the difficulty of working over mourning and depressive anxiety...|$|R
