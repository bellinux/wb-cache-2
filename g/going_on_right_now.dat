2500|$|The {{album was}} then {{revealed}} to be a double album on December 17, 2013, with the second disc containing unreleased tracks and recording sessions from the duo's second studio album, The Infamous. Prodigy stated that the album would be released during March 2014 and it would now be titled The Infamous Mobb Deep. He later said the whole project would be getting back to their original gritty New York sound. Prodigy explained to XXL; [...] "I would just say, our signature sound is a dark, sinister-type of sound.

T.I. has addressed the issue by stating {{that it was a}} response to all the people who told him to just focus on an album and not on a mixtape. T.I. further defended his decision {{to release a}} mixtape by saying: [...] "I already have 60, 70 songs. A lot of these songs are period pieces that speak volumes to what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> If I hold onto them next year or the year after, they'll be dated, because my life will be in another direction.

Barnes' descent into madness might not be the most interesting thing that's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>on</b> Gotham <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> but the show's slow, steady unfurling of this plotline is indicative of a larger patience Gotham is demonstrating with its plots this season.

The interlude was recorded in room 1306 of the Radisson Blu Royal Hotel in Copenhagen, Denmark. In an interview for The Boom Box, producer The-Dream answered a question about fans being disappointed that [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] would not be featured on Talk That Talk (2011) after it leaked online before the album's November 2011 release; the producer explained that only an interlude had been produced, and that a full length version of the song would be released {{at some point during}} the Talk That Talk era, saying: I was just talking to Rihanna about that, because she originally made just an interlude. I was like, 'Your fans are going to be so mad at you.' As soon as I said that, I got back, and I guess she released a piece of it, and they saw how long it is. Man, they tore me up on Twitter! So I hit her on the phone. I was like, 'Yo, your fans, they're <b>going</b> crazy <b>on</b> me <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> like I could make you do something.' So 'Birthday Cake' is <b>on</b> there. It's <b>going</b> to turn into a whole song because the fans are ganging up on me, and I don't want to be murdered by the Rihanna Navy!.|$|R

[...] "Thank You" [...] is a pop rap and teen pop song with a length of three minutes and forty-nine seconds. It is written in the key of B major.

Valuation takes a beautiful recursive form, as we decide each period whether to exercise the option, which we can do only once, or wait another period. I find the logic incredibly clear in discrete time, so I’ll either clarify or run roughshod over the paper’s continuous-time math, depending on your point of view. Consider asset pricing in a stationary Markov setting with a state variable x. The ex-dividend value of a claim to the stream of future dividends d might be expressed V (xt) = Et m(xt, xt+ 1) d(xt+ 1) + V (xt+ 1), (1) where m is the pricing kernel. The value of a perpetual option to buy this asset at strike price k is then J(xt) = max Et [m(xt, xt+ 1) J(xt+ 1) ], V (xt) −...|$|R
40|$|An {{emerging}} trend in consumer {{technology has been}} to build smarter technology into physical objects and to control those objects through digital interfaces. This blend of different interfaces for {{the internet of things}} reflects a response to a need for integrating technology more deeply into everyday life and providing more intuitive and natural interfaces. As these technologies advance, the line between digital information and physical objects will blur. This project explores how physical objects can be integrated into digital interfaces through the development of an interactive 3 D campus map, a component of the new MIT Atlas Service Center. The installation combines physical objects with a large touch screen table {{in order to create a}} blended engaging experience. Through the design of both the experience and interface of the installation, we explore how digital information and physical objects can work together to help people understand spatial and contextual information. The campus map allows users to explore various aspects of MIT culture from basic navigational information to the latest MIT research to what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> around campus <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> and also provides a modular platform for any location-based data visualization. by Tiffany T.
