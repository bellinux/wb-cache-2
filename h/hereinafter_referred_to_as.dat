6000|$|For {{what he knew}} {{must seem}} to his friends, and {{especially}} to his father, so wild an errand, he would ask for no supplies from home; but resolved, risking his whole future on the issue, to test during this adventure his power of supporting himself, and eventually others, by his own labours in literature. In order from the outset to save as much as possible, he made the journey in the steerage and the emigrant train. With this prime motive of economy was combined a second--that of learning for himself the pinch of life as it is felt by the unprivileged and the poor (he had long ago disclaimed for himself {{the character of a}} [...] "consistent first-class passenger in life")--and also, it should be added, a third, that of turning his experiences to literary account. On board ship he took daily notes with this intent, and wrote moreover The Story of a Lie for an English magazine. Arrived at his destination, he found his health, as was natural, badly shaken by the hardships of the journey; tried his favourite open-air cure for three weeks at an Angora goat-ranche some twenty miles from Monterey; and then lived from September to December in that old Californian coast-town itself, under the conditions set forth in the earlier of the following letters, and under a heavy combined strain of personal anxiety and literary effort. From the notes taken on board ship and in the emigrant train he drafted an account of his journey, intending to make a volume matching in form, though in contents much unlike, the earlier Inland Voyage and Travels with a Donkey. He wrote also the essays on Thoreau and the Japanese reformer, Yoshida Torajiro, afterwards published in Familiar Studies of Men and Books; one of the most vivid of his shorter tales, The Pavilion on the Links, <b>hereinafter</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "blood and thunder," [...] as well as a great part of another and longer story drawn from his new experiences and called A Vendetta in the West; but this did not satisfy him, and was never finished. He planned at the same time, in the spirit of romantic comedy, that tale which took final shape four years later as Prince Otto. Towards the end of December 1879 Stevenson moved to San Francisco, where he lived for three months in a workman's lodging, leading a life of frugality amounting, it will be seen, to self-imposed penury, and working always with the same intensity of application, until his health utterly broke down. One of the causes which contributed to his illness was the fatigue he underwent in helping to watch beside the sickbed of a child, the son of his landlady. During a part of March and April he lay at death's door--his first really dangerous sickness since childhood--and was slowly tended back to life by the joint ministrations of his future wife and the physician to whom his letter of thanks will be found below. His marriage ensued in May 1880; immediately afterwards, to try and consolidate his recovery, he moved to a deserted mining-camp in the Californian coast range; and has recorded the aspects and humours of his life there with a master's touch in the Silverado Squatters.|$|E

40|$|Our {{research}} {{examines the}} group consciousness {{of people of}} black African descent in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and its possible impact on their political participation. We define group consciousness according to three elements: (1) a common group identification as blacks, (2) a belief that their group is disadvantaged, and (3) an abiding com-mitment to African American and black ethnic coalitions. This consciousness influences them to engage in political activities that are beneficial <b>to</b> the group <b>as</b> a whole and <b>to</b> them <b>as</b> individuals (Dawson 1994). A small body of black group consciousness research has examined its impact through the usage of a few in-depth interviews (Watters 1999; Rogers 2006; Woldemikael 1989 a; Zephir 2004). Using an original survey of over one thousand respon-dents, we question whether a common group conscious-ness exists among African Americans and groups that we <b>hereinafter</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> black ethnics. 1 We then ana-lyze its possible impact on their political participation. Our research adds to the few studies of black group con-sciousness in the United States by assessing its existence among African Americans and other groups of black African descent. 404563 PRQ 65310. 1177 / 1065912911404563 W right Austin et al.
