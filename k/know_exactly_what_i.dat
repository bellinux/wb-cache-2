He then decided {{to pursue a career}} in film-making; he attended two courses in basic film-making at State University of New York. He stated, [...] "I always knew I wanted to be in films but I did not <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do. I loved movies and watched a lot of them. But my father insisted that I get a good education before I joined the film industry".|$|E
500|$|... "Into the Groove" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna and her then-boyfriend Stephen Bray. The singer had initially written the song for her friend Mark Kamins' protégée, Chyne, and recorded a demo which Kamins intended to modify later. However, Madonna {{believed that the}} song would be more suitable for her film Desperately Seeking Susan, and recorded it with Bray for the film's soundtrack. When Kamins {{found out he was}} furious that Madonna did not inform him that she would use the song for the film. The singer retorted: [...] "I'm tough, I'm ambitious and I <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want. If that makes me a bitch, that's okay." [...] "Into the Groove" [...] ultimately did not appear on the soundtrack album of the film, but was released on the 1985 worldwide re-issue of Madonna's second studio album, Like a Virgin. During an interview with Time, Madonna said that she wrote the song while watching a Latin boy across her balcony. Describing the song as [...] "dorky", Madonna further explained: ...|$|E

Writing about his Equivalents to Hart Crane, he declared: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have photographed.

When I was comfortably settled in the prison, and <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> owed, I thought it my duty to my father {{to give him the}} first chance of getting me out. His answer to my letter contained a quotation from Shakespeare on the subject of thankless children, but no remittance of money. After that, my only course was to employ a lawyer and be declared a bankrupt. I was most uncivilly treated, and remanded two or three times. When everything I possessed had been sold for the benefit of my creditors, I was reprimanded and let out. It is pleasant to think that, even then, my faith in myself and in human nature was still not shaken.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the release}} {{and success of}} her album Loud (2010), Rihanna {{originally}} revealed via Twitter that the album would be re-issued with new songs and released in Fall 2011, writing that [...] "he [...] continues with more new music to add to [...] collection". In September 2011, Rihanna again took to the social networking site {{to confirm that the}} plans had been scrapped, with the singer tweeting [...] "I [...] a , but LOUD is its own body of work! Plus [...] guys work so hard that [...] deserve to act brand new". On September 19, 2011, Rihanna further provoked excitement amongst her followers when she posted that she was listening to the song, only to be re-tweeted by Calvin Harris, who replied [...] "Sometimes it feels like we find love in the most hopeless place", suggesting that his response contained possible lyrics from the song. In an interview with Capital FM, Harris – who produced the track – explained that followers of Rihanna had sent messages to him regarding their expectations of the song, saying [...] "The song better not be rubbish", which he interpreted as slightly threatening, but {{went on to say that}} [...] "it's all part of the fun". In an interview for Q magazine, Harris said of the lyric, [...] "we found love in a hopeless place," [...] "It could have been Jumpin Jaks in Dumfries (Harris' home town), I don't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was thinking about." ...|$|E

2500|$|In addition, {{since the}} band {{had not yet}} signed their deal with Atlantic Records, Page and Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant paid for the {{sessions}} entirely themselves, meaning there was no record company money to waste on excessive studio time. In another interview, Page revealed that the self-funding was to ensure artistic freedom: [...] "I wanted artistic control in a vise grip, because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to do with}} these fellows. In fact, I financed and completely recorded the first album before going to Atlantic ... It wasn't your typical story where you get an advance to make an album – we arrived at Atlantic with tapes in hand ... Atlantic's reaction was very positive – I mean they signed us, didn't they?" ...|$|R

I made a comment about Danyl changing the lyrics of his song. It {{was meant to be}} a humorous moment about the fact he has an opportunity to have fun with his song. An openly bisexual singing a song that is lyrically a 'girl's song'. Danyl and I were joking about the very same thing in rehearsals on Friday, so it carried on to the show. I'd like to apologise to anyone that was offended by my comments, it was never my intention.

5000|$|Duffy {{had already}} written {{the lyrics to}} [...] "Mercy" [...] before her meeting with Steve Booker, {{although}} she has since said that she [...] "never has a plan as that always fails", {{in reference to the}} writing of the song. Duffy has noted that during recording with Booker, [...] "Mercy" [...] "was like this melodic poem in my mind, which I just had to get out, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted it to sound like". She has also said that they [...] "built the song from the bottom up", also noting that it is [...] "very important that my songs start from an organic source, rather than a drum loop". When asked of the lyrical meaning of the song, Duffy said:"The lyrics were about having a feeling towards someone, whether it’s a romantic feeling or just some chemistry that you don’t want, and you desperately want to be released from that feeling." ...|$|R

60|$|What a find! Already I had {{visions of}} the long-looked-for brace of my team, and of the pennant, and the little cottage, and the happy light {{of a pair of}} blue eyes. What he meant to me, that country pitcher Hurtle! He shut out the Spatsburg team without a run or a hit or even a scratch. Then I went after him. I {{collared}} him and his manager, and there, surrounded by the gaping players, I bought him and signed him before any of them <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was about. I did not haggle. I asked the manager what he wanted and produced the cash; <b>I</b> asked Hurtle <b>what</b> he wanted, doubled his ridiculously modest demand, paid him in advance, and got his name to the contract. Then I breathed a long, deep breath; the first one for weeks. Something told me that with Hurtle's signature in my pocket I had the Eastern League pennant. Then I invited all concerned down to the Rickettsville hotel.|$|R

500|$|John Tobias {{said that}} his inspirations for the game's story and {{characters}} came from the Chinese mythology {{and some of the}} stories and rumored events about the Shaolin monks. Regarding the film Big Trouble in Little China, Tobias wrote that although this movie [...] "kind of Americanized my obsession for supernatural kung fu films from China, it was not my biggest influence. My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films -- Zu Warriors & The Swordsman. We had to get them from bootleggers in Chicago's Chinatown." [...] Tobias' writing and artistic input on the series ended in 1997. Fifteen years later, he said: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was going to do with a future story. A few years ago I [...] a sort of sequel to the first MK film and an advancement to the game's mythological roots. The goal was to not runaway from what came before with a retelling, but to move the themes forward. I did it for fun as an exercise in screenwriting, but it felt good to get that out of my system." ...|$|R

He was delighted at the opportunity of advancing me, and we were both happy.|$|E
5000|$|The Kimberlys were {{a quartet}} {{consisting}} of two brothers from Oklahoma and their wives, who are also sisters. The liner notes state that they were familiar to other musicians in the Las Vegas area. Jennings intended to gain for them a wider audience with this album. Three of the songs on the album are written or co-written by Harold Gay, one of the members. The album is best remembered for its version of Jimmy Webb's [...] "MacArthur Park," [...] which rose to #23 on the Billboard country charts and won a Grammy for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group. In his autobiography, Jennings insisted he had {{a vision for the}} song from the start: [...] "Danny and I got into it a couple of times over the arrangement. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted the strings to do; I had to hum the parts.
