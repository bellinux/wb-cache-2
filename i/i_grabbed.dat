500|$|Finally, while I {{was visiting}} Andrew at his country estate in Berkshire to play him the tracks we had recorded, he {{suddenly}} {{sat down at}} the piano and played the most beautiful melody, which he suggested could be our new song. Needless to say, <b>I</b> <b>grabbed</b> it. However, we still needed lyrics and Tim dutifully began to put words to the music. The vast majority of the original Evita score had been done this way: music first, lyrics afterwards. After many weeks of nail biting, Tim was finally cajoled into writing the lyrics that now accompany the music to [...] "You Must Love Me".|$|E
500|$|In his written {{confession}} {{released by}} Peruvian police, Van der Sloot recounted that he briefly left {{the hotel to}} get some coffee and bread, and returned to find Flores using his laptop computer without his permission. A police source stated {{that she may have}} found information linking him to the disappearance of Holloway. An altercation allegedly began, and she attempted to escape. According to the aforementioned written confession released by Peruvian authorities, Van der Sloot stated, [...] "I did not want to do it. The girl intruded into my private life [...] [...] [...] she didn't have any right. I went to her and I hit her. She was scared, we argued and she tried to escape. <b>I</b> <b>grabbed</b> her by the neck and hit her." [...] Van der Sloot reportedly stated that he was stoned on marijuana at the time. A detective linked to the case said that Van der Sloot considered getting rid of the body in a suitcase, but decided against it because he would have been stopped at the front desk. He then reportedly drank espresso and took amphetamines to counter fatigue before fleeing.|$|E
500|$|An Argyle Hall of Famer {{returned}} to Home Park on 18 October 2009, when former England international Paul Mariner was appointed as the club's new head coach. [...] "In football, {{there is not}} much sentiment. But, if sentiment is involved in this scenario, then they gave me my very first chance as a player so <b>I</b> <b>grabbed</b> it with both hands," [...] said Mariner on the New England Revolution website, the club he left to rejoin Argyle. [...] "Plymouth Argyle are in my blood. Obviously the teams you're associated with are the ones you look for every week, and when they came knocking on my door asking me to be employed there, I was delighted." [...] His first match in the dugout alongside Sturrock ended in disappointment as Argyle lost 3–1 to Bristol City at Ashton Gate. They faced Ipswich Town, another side struggling for form, at home in their next match and a first-half goal from Fletcher put Argyle ahead, but their hopes of claiming three points were dented when the visitors equalised through striker Jon Stead, who capitalised on a poor back pass from Gary Sawyer. Welshman Darcy Blake, on loan from Cardiff City, was shown a straight red card late in the game as it ended all square. Their final game of October took place on Halloween against Middlesbrough, in Gordon Strachan's first game as their new manager. Argyle came away from the Riverside Stadium with all three points, in a game that saw Adam Johnson miss from the penalty spot, thanks to a second-half goal from Mackie to lift them to 22nd in the league table, within three points of Doncaster Rovers.|$|E

500|$|After {{months of}} acting and singing auditions, Hal Prince offered the still {{relatively}} unknown Paige {{the title role}} of Eva Perón {{in the first stage}} production of the Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, Evita. Her performance won her critical acclaim and brought her into public prominence at the age of 30. Julie Covington, who played the role on the original concept album, had turned down the opportunity of playing the role on stage leading to a long search for a new star. Paige eventually competed against Bonnie Schoen, an American initially favoured by Prince for the role. She later said, [...] "Bonnie was already a big name on Broadway. In a way, she didn't have anything to prove. She was smoothly, silkily professional. But I saw this as my big chance and, like Eva when she clapped eyes on Peron, <b>I</b> <b>grabbed</b> with both hands. I wanted the role more than anything else in the whole world." [...] For her performance in Evita, she won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Musical, which at that time was called the Society of West End Theatre Award. She also won the Variety Club Award for Showbusiness Personality of the Year. She played the role for 20 months in total, from 1978 to 1980. She also released her first studio album in 1978, titled Sitting Pretty. Just prior to her success in Evita, Paige had strongly considered becoming a nursery nurse, but after she sang for Dustin Hoffman, he made her promise that she would continue in theatre work. She admitted that she was [...] "fed up with the whole thing" [...] and that she could not even afford new clothing or to eat out; [...] "Evita saved me" [...] she stated.|$|E

[...] The music begins and Kesha makes eyes at James Van Der Beek. After the eye contact Kesha grabs one of the unicorns and kisses him then removes her bra and throws it across the room, Van Der Beek then does the same with his bra, puzzling Kesha as to why he was wearing a bra. The music fades in the background as the two then {{make their way to the}} center of the dance floor and exchange words ("Well, well, well. If it isn’t James Van Der Douche.", [...] "I don't appreciate you slander-Beeking my name, Ke dollar sign ha.") before engaging in a gun fight. They begin shooting lasers at one another, killing multiple unicorns. Van Der Beek gets hit in the shoulder and falls. Kesha steps on his arm to stop him from reaching for his gun, as he begs for mercy, which Kesha denies. At the end of the video, it is revealed that Kesha killed Van Der Beek and that she has mounted his head on her wall with the plaque reading, [...] "James Van Der Dead", as she sits with two unicorns laughing. She then frowns at the camera and it switches to Van Der Beek one more time before the screen goes black.|$|E

2500|$|After realizing she had missed, {{she raised}} her arm again, and Oliver Sipple, a former Marine, dived towards her and grabbed her arm, {{possibly}} saving President Ford's life. Sipple said at the time: [...] "I saw [...] pointed out there and <b>I</b> <b>grabbed</b> for it. [...] I lunged and grabbed the woman's arm and the gun went off." [...] The bullet from the second shot ricocheted and hit John Ludwig, a 42-year-old taxi driver. Ludwig survived. U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti, still on the bench in 2010, spoke on the record, saying that Moore would have killed President Ford had {{she had her own}} gun, and it was only [...] "because her gun was faulty" [...] that the president's life was spared.|$|E

2500|$|According to Sergeant Miller, [...] "We {{continued}} {{to treat the}} patients, continued moving ammunition and grenades {{to where they were}} needed. <b>I</b> <b>grabbed</b> a radio … and set up satellite communication and then returned to the rear." [...] Tech Sergeant Miller and Senior Airman Jason Cunningham, like Miller, a pararescueman, worked hard to keep the patients from succumbing to hypothermia. They put them in the helicopter and removed its insulation and wrapped it around the wounded Rangers. In addition, they used the majority of the fluids available in the medical kits and anything else, including the heaters packed in their food rations. With the help of the additional Rangers and more air strikes, they took the hill, killing many al Qaeda combatants. They also recovered the bodies of Petty Officer Roberts and Sergeant Chapman.|$|E
