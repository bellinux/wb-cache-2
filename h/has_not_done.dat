It describes the {{events leading up to}} the Nanking Massacre and the atrocities that were committed. The book presents the view that the Japanese government <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>done</b> enough to redress the atrocities. It {{is one of the first}} major English-language books to introduce the Nanking Massacre to Western and Eastern readers alike, and has been translated into several languages.|$|E
5|$|A {{year has}} past since the {{encounter}} with Beerus. Goku and Vegeta had been training under Whis who had taken them as his students to master on controlling their flow of energy, maintaining it from within themselves. During this time, the remaining remnant of Frieza's army had went to earth to use the dragon balls to revive the long dead galactic ruler. Being revived and regenerated from the army's latest technology of regeneration, Frieza had began to plot his revenge on Goku who had defeated him on planet Namek. Learning that he had defeated Majin Buu, one of two beings warned not to fight with from his father; the other being Beerus, Frieza decided to begin intense training to reach new heights of power to face Goku. Frieza's army had arrived on Earth while Goku and Vegeta still training with Whis. Tien, Piccolo, Gohan, Krillin, and Master Roshi had fought the remnant until their return. Once arriving on Earth, Frieza and Goku had fought showing their latest forms and power. Goku achieved a form beyond the Super Saiyan God form being the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (Super Sayian Blue). Frieza revealed his new form achieved after training stating he <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>done</b> before, calling it his Golden form.|$|E
5|$|Convinced that he <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>done</b> {{anything}} wrong, Bart {{decides to}} run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E

25|$|Another year later, the US-American {{ophthalmologist}} William Bates, perhaps motivated like Oliver, instilled adrenal extracts {{into the}} eye, found that ″the conjunctiva {{of the globe}} and lids whitened in a few minutes″, correctly explained the effect by vasoconstriction, and administered the extracts in various eye diseases. Later catecholamine literature <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>done</b> him justice. Even an ophthalmological review article of 1905 mentions him only in passing.|$|E

25|$|The {{constitution}} provides, and the Supreme Court has reiterated, {{that all}} proceedings in the Supreme Court of India, the country's highest {{court and the}} High Courts, shall be in English.

25|$|Building a MANET {{is still}} {{untested}} under the OLPC's current configuration and hardware environment. Although one {{goal of the}} laptop {{is that all of}} its software be open source, the source code for this routing protocol is currently closed source. While there are open-source alternatives such as OLSR or B.A.T.M.A.N., none of these options is yet available running at the data-link layer (Layer 2) on the Wi-Fi subsystem's co-processor; this is critical to OLPC's power efficiency scheme. Whether Marvell Technology Group, the producer of the wireless chip set and owner of the current meshing protocol software, will make the firmware open source is still an unanswered question. As of 2011, it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>done</b> so.|$|E

Andrew attempts to tell Natasha that he sold the app without her knowledge, but decides to wait until the following day. Natasha, Chris Pappas (James Mason) and Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) give Andrew tickets to see The Jezabels in the city that night. Sophie Ramsay (Kaiya Jones) also plans to attend the concert, but her uncle, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis), forbids her from going because she <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>done</b> her homework. Andrew and his friends meet outside in Ramsay Street to put their belongings in Chris' car and Andrew expresses his unhappiness that Ed is coming along. While the group talk, Sophie sneaks out of her house and gets into the boot of Chris' car unseen.|$|E

25|$|Expired vehicle {{registrations}} may {{attract the}} attention of law enforcement, because indicators of an expired plate, such as an old or invalid sticker, give officers probable cause to lawfully initiate a traffic stop. A delinquent registration tag is often an indicator that the vehicle may be stolen, that the vehicle's owner has failed to comply with the applicable law regarding emission inspection or insurance, or that the vehicle's owner has unpaid traffic or parking tickets. Most states historically required all license plates to be replaced every few years; that practice is being abandoned by many states because of the expense of continually producing large numbers of plates. Washington stopped the practice of mandatory replacement in 2015. Maryland previously mandated that all license plates be replaced every five years (except for apportioned trailers, which were registered on an eight-year schedule), but <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>done</b> so since 1986.|$|E
25|$|Several {{months after}} her presumed death, Ryan {{receives}} a champagne flute from Greenlee. Realizing {{that no one ever}} actually identified the body, he comes to believe that Greenlee is still alive. In November 2009, Ryan discovers Greenlee's medical records on David's computer, who claims he was using them for research into Amanda Dillon's pregnancy. It is later revealed that David has been keeping Greenlee in Massachusetts while she recovers. Greenlee has been comatose for the past year and has no memory of the accident. Upon her awakening, David tells Greenlee that she is paralyzed and if she does not have surgery to fix her spine, she will remain paralyzed {{for the rest of her}} life. She tells David that she wants to do the surgery, but if she dies during surgery, not to tell anybody that she was alive before her death. After successfully recovering from her injuries, Greenlee attempts to visit Ryan but is surprised to see him having sex with Erica Kane. Out for revenge, Greenlee asks David to bring her a hard-drive hidden in Ryan's house. She puts the hard-drive into Fusion's computer and it crashes all the files. Even with Fusion's files being lost, Erica is set out to build Fusion back up once again; during an interview, she tells reporters that whoever crashed Fusion's computers has not destroyed the company. Greenlee feels that she <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>done</b> enough and decides to stay in Pine Valley. Greenlee asks David to marry her, hoping that when she walks down the aisle at her wedding, everyone will be surprised, and that Ryan will be hurt.|$|E

500|$|Fischer won the Interzonal (held in Palma de Mallorca in November and December 1970) with 18½/23 (+15−1=7), {{far ahead}} of Larsen, Efim Geller, and Robert Hübner, with 15/23. Fischer {{finished}} the tournament with seven consecutive wins. Setting aside the Sousse Interzonal (which Fischer withdrew from while leading), Fischer's victory gave him a string of eight consecutive first prizes in tournaments. Former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik was not, however, impressed by Fischer's results, stating: [...] "Fischer has been declared a genius. I {{do not agree with}} this... In order to rightly be declared a genius in chess, you have to defeat equal opponents by a big margin. As yet he <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>done</b> this". Despite Botvinnik's remarks, [...] "Fischer began a miraculous year in the history of chess".|$|E

[...] In 1938, she toured Palestine, where she filmed what she described as Jewish immigrants ruining the country. While touring Spain, then embroiled in the Spanish Civil War, she filmed [...] "Red torture chambers" [...] and burnt-out churches, [...] "ruined by the Reds with the same satanic Jewish glee shown in Russia." [...] She visited Japan, which she viewed as the only Christian nation in Asia, and in 1939, she returned to visit Spain, for a second time.|$|E
