Because a prototypical rotary calciner was not available for use, studies to evaluate the offgas from the calcination process were performed using a benchtop rotary calciner and laboratory-scale equipment (Lucy et al. 1998).

30|$|Solid waste {{disposals}} (open dumps, landfills, sanitary landfills or incinerators) represent a {{significant source of}} metals released into the environment (Yarlagadda et al. 1995; Waheed et al. 2010; Iwegbue et al. 2010; Bretzel and Calderisi 2011; Rizo et al. 2012). Leachate is produced primarily in association with precipitation that infiltrates through the refuse and normally results in the migration of leachate into the groundwater zone and pollutes it (Samuding 2009). Due to migration of leachate, soils have been contaminated with heavy metals such as lead, copper, zinc, iron, manganese, chromium, and cadmium and these heavy metals in solid wastes lead to serious problems because they cannot be biodegraded (Hong et al. 2002). The major sources of heavy metals in landfills are the co-disposed industrial wastes, <b>incinerator</b> <b>ashes,</b> mine wastes and household hazardous substances such as batteries, paints, dyes, inks, etc. (Erses and Onay 2003). Soil contamination by heavy metals from waste disposal sites is a serious problem in industrial and urban areas (Mandal and Sengupta 2006). Soils are regarded as the ultimate sink for heavy metals discharged into the environment, as many heavy metals are bound to soils (Obiajunwa et al. 2002). Furthermore, when screening for pollutants in soil and leachate at contaminated sites, the results are often required directly, since classification of the soil is needed before determination of remediation techniques (Banar et al. 2007). Hence, this study has been carried out to assess the soil contamination around the local dump area where the municipal solid wastes have been disposed for about 45  years.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{general scope}} of this concern is to explore the {{formulation}} and the production, by thermochemical transformations, of expanded lightweight granulates incorporating residual materials as industrial and sewage sludge, schists, kaolinic waste, wasted glass… Depending on their nature, these materials contain fluxes, calorific power substances and potential pollutants. The possible application fields are light concretes, road engineering, water treatment and hydroponic agriculture. The benefits can be multiple: create new resources from wastes; preserve alluvial resources, humid zones on the river banks and the natural course of rivers; manage hazardous residual materials. Tests on the thermal treatment and the thermochemical expansion were conducted in horizontal experimental set-up including a static electrical furnace. Raw mixtures and treatment products were examined by visible microscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). Data analysis of the experimental results showed the possibility of obtaining the expanded granulates at temperatures lower than 1200 °C for a firing time around 10 minutes. The optimal temperature for their synthesis {{is a function of}} fluxes content and decreased dramatically with increase of the wasted glass amount. Obtained granulates have a density lower than unity and they have a good mechanical strength fulfilling the conditions for their use as building materials.

Ninety-one sewage sludge and <b>incinerator</b> <b>ash</b> samples from the sewage treatment facilities in Sheffield, Birmingham and 7 other UK cities were analyzed for PGE. The highest concentrations are 602 ppb Pt and 710 ppb Pd with lower maximum concentrations of 65 ppb Rh, 100 ppb Ru, 33 ppb Ir and 12 ppb Os. Ash from incinerated sewage was found to have higher PGE concentrations compared to the original sludge and the PGE ratios are preserved during incineration. Rh is more mobilized and dispersed than the other PGE as it is transported from roads into the drainage system and into sewage.

40|$|Mineral {{carbonation}} is {{a permanent}} and safe way for the sequestration of anthropogenic CO 2. Carbonation reactions of metal oxides- and hydroxides-bearing alkaline solid waste occur spontaneously at atmospheric temperature and pressure, but proceed slowly to obtain an industrial viable process. In order to enhance mineral carbonation it is necessary a careful selection of the process routes and the process conditions and to use pre-treatments that increase the material reactivity. Mechanical activation is a pre-treatment method that increases mineral dissolution rates due to particle size reduction, specific surface increase and structural disorder production. Many experiments were conducted by increasing the grinding time and the carbonation time of the selected materials (steelmaking slag, <b>incinerator</b> <b>ashes</b> and track ballast) to evaluate how increasing grinding time influences the carbonation rate. The two key factors for {{the selection of the}} materials for the laboratory tests were the presence of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals and the time of mechanical activation.

The chemical composition of the samples was determined with X-ray fluorescence, a simultaneous DSC / TGA analyzer was utilized to define the carbonate content, the CO 2 uptake and the calcium conversion efficiency and X-ray diffraction was used to determine the mineralogical composition of the materials and the changes in the crystal structure after the experiments.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{a model for}} {{regional}} waste management in Central Norway is presented, with a special focus on challenges and different disposal strategies concerning waste incineration residues, such as bottom ash, fly ash and filter cake from flue gas cleaning systems. The main objective {{of this study is}} evaluating the total environmental performance of different waste incineration and ash disposal strategies, using a combined material flow accounting (MFA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Different incineration technologies, and technology-specific performance regarding residues generation, are presented. Properties of different incineration residues, existing ash disposal strategy for the region and different alternative ash treatment strategies are also presented and discussed. An existing waste model for Central Norway is expanded to also include the amounts and flows of incineration residues generated in the region. The chemical composition of the residues is also accounted for. This dynamic waste model describe the development in waste generation and incineration residues generation, and is used as a basis for the further development of scenarios. To different scenarios are developed for waste incineration and residues disposal for the region; a centralized waste incieration scenario with disposal of <b>incinerator</b> <b>ashes</b> to landfills (Scenario A), and a decentralized waste incineration scenario with regional vitrification of the incineration residues (Scenario B). These two scenarios’ potential environmental impacts are compared using life cycle assassment methodology. The timespan of this assessment starts in year 2002 and ends in 2020. The results from this assessment show that Scenario B clearly has the lowest overall potential for environmental impacts. The results also show that the impacts from the subprocesses connected to the residuals downstreams from the incineration, are of minor importance to the total impacts. An exception here is the impact category “terrestrial ecotoxicity”, where landfilling of bottom ash is the dominant contributor for the total impact potential for this impact category. The subprocesses connected to the residuals disposal/treatment for both scenarios have also been compared separately. This comparison showed {{that it is difficult to}} say which of the two residual strategies that has the best overall environmental performance. The landfilling strategy in Sceanrio A causes highest potential impacts for certain impact categories such as “terrestrial ecotoxicity” and “eutrophication”, while the vitrification strategy causes highest potential impacts for other impact categories such as “global warming potential” and “acidification”. A change in the residuals treatment strategy will thus not necessarily reduce the total potential for environmental harm, but instead change the main impacts from one impact category to another - a situation often reffered to as “problem shifting”. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceKnowledge of {{the cause}} and source of Pb {{pollution}} is important to abate environmental Pb pollution by taking source-related actions. Lead isotope analysis is a potentially powerful tool to identify anthropogenic Pb and its sources in the environment. Spatial information on the variation of anthropogenic Pb content and anthropogenic Pb sources in rural topsoils is remarkably limited. This study presents results of a survey of approximately 350 topsoil samples from rural locations covering the entire Netherlands, for which the bulk geochemical and Pb isotope compositions were determined. The specific {{aim of this study}} is to determine the anthropogenic Pb sources in the topsoils from rural areas in The Netherlands. The spatial distribution of anthropogenic Pb in soils in The Netherlands will be explained in terms of land use and pollution sources. Nearly all studied topsoils display Pb contents that exceed the amount expected based on the soil lithology. The range in Pb isotope ratios of the additional Pb fraction in rural Dutch topsoils is established at 1. 056 - 1. 199, 2. 336 - 2. 486 and 0. 452 - 0. 490 for Pb- 206 /Pb- 207, Pb- 207 /Pb- 208 and Pb- 206 /Pb- 208, respectively. Five land use types are distinguished (forest, open nature, moor, arable land and grassland) with distinct isotopic compositions for added Pb. Additional Pb in soils of natural areas (forest, open nature and moor) has on average lower Pb- 206 /Pb- 207, Pb- 208 /Pb- 207 and Pb- 206 /Pb- 208 ratios than the agricultural soils (arable land and grassland). Additional Pb in both natural area soils and agricultural soils is interpreted to be of anthropogenic origin: most likely a mixture of coal/galena, <b>incinerator</b> <b>ashes</b> and gasoline Pb. The dominant sources of additional Pb in the topsoil of open nature areas are most likely incinerator ash and gasoline Pb. In contrast, the on average higher Pb- 206 /Pb- 207, Pb- 208 /Pb- 207 and Pb- 206 /Pb- 208 ratios of additional Pb in agricultural soils are most likely caused by the presence of animal manure and N-P fertilizers. Several areas are observed with notably high additional Pb contents (26 - 211 mg/kg on an organic matter-free basis) in the topsoil. The largest area is the Randstad area, which has the highest population and traffic density, and hosts a considerable fraction of the Dutch chemical industry. Two other areas with high additional Pb contents in the topsoil are located near the Dutch borders and are most likely influenced by German and Belgian chemical industries. The topsoils in the coastal dunes and southern, central and northern forests are characterized by relatively low additional Pb contents (< 10 mg/kg on an organic matter-free basis).

Sweco Environment {{was commissioned}} by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency to do a screening study of metals and brominated and chlorinated dioxins and furans in ashes from incineration of waste and biofuels. The study has two primary objectives: a. to assess whether the composition of incineration ashes can serve as indicator for the monitoring of the change of use of environmentally harmful substances in society. b. to {{provide a basis for}} evaluation of risks in connection to the use of ashes Eleven metals (arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, mercury, manganese, nickel, lead, vanadium, and zinc) as well as chlorinated and brominated dioxins and furans were analysed in the ashes. The study included 25 samples from the following matrices: · 8 samples of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) bottom ash · 5 samples of MSWI fly ash · 6 samples of biofuel incineration bottom ash · 6 samples of biofuel incineration fly ash Samples from biofuel incineration ashes included two samples of each fly and bottom ashes from plants that include recycled wood in their fuel mix. Sampling was undertaken in accordance with a simplified method based on NT Envir 004. A minimum of three samples were collected over a period of one to two weeks. Samples collected within this project were complemented with saved samples from a previous project on critical metals in waste incineration ashes (Johansson et al 2013). All sampling was undertaken by participating incineration plants. Metal concentrations detected in this study were broadly similar to concentrations shown in previous studies (WSP 2012, Johansson et al 2013), though the variation was large (which is in agreement with results in other studies). Metal concentrations in ashes from incineration of biofuels containing recycled wood are generally higher than in ashes from plants using pure biofuels. However, the mean mercury concentration is slightly higher in fly ash from incineration of pure biofuels. Chlorinated dioxins and furans were detected in all samples. The total concentrations varied between 12. 9 and 340, 000 ng/kg dw corresponding to between 0. 88 and 4, 300 ng WHO-TEQ/kg dw (upper bound). Concentrations of chlorinated dioxins and furans were generally higher in fly ashes than in bottom ashes. Results are presented in Table A. The results from analyses of municipal waste incineration ashes showed similar results as in the study performed in 2006 by Avfall Sverige (Avfall Sverige 2009). However, the analyses of biofuel ashes showed higher concentrations in this study than in previously reported studies (WSP 2012, Bjurström 2006). There was no difference in the concentrations of dioxins and furans in the ashes from ecycled wood and pure biofuels. Brominated dioxins and furans were detected in all samples. The total concentrations varied between 12 and 29, 600 ng/kg dw. There are no toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) for brominated dioxins and furans. To calculate WHO-TEQ sums for the brominated species in the samples, the TEFs for the corresponding chlorinated species were used. WHO-TEQ sums for the brominated species varied between 0. 3 and 140 ng/kg dw (upper bound). Results are presented in Table B. Table B. Results from analyses of brominated dioxins and furans in incineration ashes. Results from the analyses of brominated dioxins and furans indicated similar levels in MSWI bottom ash as in a Taiwanese study (Wang et al 2010), however the distribution was larger in this study. Concentrations in MSWI fly ash was slightly higher in this study compared to the Taiwanese study. Similar to the Taiwanese study, results from this study indicated higher concentrations in MSWI bottom ash than in MSWI fly ash. No previous studies of brominated dioxins and furans in biofuel ashes were found. The results from this study indicate lower concentrations in biofuel ashes than in MSWI ashes. As opposed to MSWI ashes, concentrations are higher in fly ash from incineration of biofuels than in bottom ash. No effects could be seen from the use of recycled wood in the fuel mix in biofuel incineration plants on the concentrations of brominated dioxins and furans. For the purpose of describing risks in connection with use of ashes, a simplified assessment has been made by comparing the concentrations in this study with concentrations deemed to be of negligible risk to {{human health and the environment}} (Swedish: mindre än ringa risk) for aggregates from recycled materials, as described in a guidance document from Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (Naturvårdsverket 2010). The comparison shows that these concentrations were exceeded in all samples. This does not mean that the ashes are not suitable for use in aggregates, but that the use is subject to an individual assessment in each case. Only total concentrations has been analysed within the scope of this study, and no speciated analyses were undertaken. Risks associated with unwanted compounds in the ashes are not only connected to the total concentrations in the ashes, but to a large extent also to the leachability of those compounds. In order to decide whether an ash is suitable for recycling for a certain purpose, additional characterisation is required. Furthermore, the risk associated with potential exposure or contamination in relation to that specific usage should be highlighted. Also, positive environmental effects from the use of ashes should be taken into account when evaluating the suitability of its use. Recycling of ashes as aggregate may substitute virgin materials, thereby saving natural resources. Overall, the results obtained in this study, correlate well with results from previous studies. Brominated dioxins and furans, which are not as extensively studied previously, were detected in all samples in this study. The contribution to WHO-TEQ is small in most samples, compared to the contribution from chlorinated dioxins and furans. In MSWI bottom ash, the contribution to WHO-TEQ is larger from brominated than from chlorinated dioxins and furans. However, the sum of WHO-TEQ in MSWI bottom ash is low compared to the concentrations in fly ash. In conclusion, the study showed that <b>incinerator</b> <b>ashes</b> are not suitable as indicator for the monitoring of the change of use of environmentally harmful substances in society. Municipal and industrial wastes are often incinerated together and since municipal waste is imported for incineration in Sweden, the ashes will not reflect changes in consumption patterns in Sweden...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to study the {{feasibility}} of using the <b>Incinerator</b> bottom <b>ash</b> fine aggregate to replace natural fine aggregate in the cement mortar products. The research adopts high cement content mortar to conduct the experiment, in which the weight ratio of cement/ag-gregate is 1 / 2. The experiment uses <b>Incinerator</b> bottom <b>ash</b> fine aggregates, which passes through # 16 sieve, and natural sand of the same size as the aggregate, and separates mortar specimens in-to two main categories based on different W/C ratio. Moreover, different proportions of furnace slag and F-class are used to replace a portion of cement so as to explore the influence on strength of <b>Incinerator</b> bottom <b>ash</b> aggregates mortar by adding the two admixtures. The study shows that, based on the 1 : 2 cement/aggregate weight ratio, <b>Incinerator</b> bottom <b>ash</b> fine aggre-gates mortar, unit weight around 1. 8 g/cm 3, is 20 % lighter natural fine aggregate mortar, unit weight around 2. 2 g/cm 3. The <b>Incinerator</b> bottom <b>ash</b> fine aggregates mortar can only reach 60 %- 70 % the compres-sive strength of natural fine aggregates mortar. Direct tensile strength and flexural tensile strength tests are 15 % and 30 % of compressive strength respectively, due to the irregular strength development, which does not follow general concepts, such as low W/C ratio and mineral admix-tures will not necessarily help in strength development in <b>Incinerator</b> bottom <b>ash</b> fine aggregates mortar...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{recycle waste}} materials, {{the work is}} {{concerned}} with development of a glass-ceramic from a Korean <b>incinerator</b> fly <b>ash</b> with a high content of Cl. As a pre-treatment of ash, water washing the fly ash {{was used to remove}} the high Cl content before melting the ash. The process induced internal crystallization of fly ash after melting under a single stage heat treatment without adding nucleating agents into the ash. As a result, fracture stress of 220 MPa and fracture toughness of 1. 7 MPam 1 / 2 were found in the glass-ceramic, which were high values compared to others reported. Thus, the present process suggests that a good glass-ceramic produced from an <b>incinerator</b> <b>ash</b> could be applicable for structural materials in terms of economical and environmental points...|$|R

40|$|Waste {{incineration}} {{is still}} an essential technology {{in the concept of}} integrated waste management. Most of the combustion residues are <b>incinerator</b> bottom <b>ash.</b> It has been discovered that <b>incinerator</b> bottom <b>ash</b> from the incineration of separated waste in the primary chamber of the modular two-stage incinerator mainly consists of metal oxides, especially SiO 2 and CaO, in proportions that are quite similar to those in cement and so the feasibility of its application as a substitute for cement in concrete was investigated. It was found that after 28 days, the flexural and compressive strengths of the binder using bottom ash were practically comparable with those of a pure cement mixture. The results show that it is reasonable to use a binder containing <b>incinerator</b> bottom <b>ash</b> for applications in which an early-stage lower strength of concrete element is acceptable...|$|R
