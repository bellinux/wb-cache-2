25|$|In March 2016 a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in Washington, D.C., allowing pilot ground robotic deliveries. The program was to take place from September 15 {{through the end of}} December 2017. The robots were limited to a weight of 50 pounds unloaded and maximum speed of 10 miles per hour. In case the robot stopped moving because of malfunction the company was required to remove it from the streets within 24 hours. There were allowed only 5 robots to be tested per company at a time. A 2017 version of the Personal <b>Delivery</b> <b>Device</b> Act bill was under review as of March 2017.|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} {{in the development of}} central nervous system drugs is to obtain therapeutic effective drug concentrations inside the brain. Many potentially effective drugs have never reached clinical application because of poor brain penetration. Currently, devices are being developed that may improve drug delivery into the brain. One approach involves the encapsulation of drugs into nanocarriers that are targeted to the brain, where the drug is released. Alternatively, living cells have been engineered to produce the pharmaceutical of interest at the target site. It is important to follow the fate of these drug <b>delivery</b> <b>devices</b> inside the body to verify their efficiency in reaching the brain. To this end, both ex-vivo approaches and in-vivo imaging techniques are used, including ex-vivo biodistribution, autoradiography, MRI, optical imaging, PET and SPECT. All these methods have their specific advantages and limitations. Consequently, selection of the tracking method should be based on the specific aims of the experiment. Here, we will discuss the methods that are currently applied for tracking brain drug <b>delivery</b> <b>devices,</b> including the most commonly used labels and labeling procedures for living cells and nanocarriers. Subsequently, we will discuss specific applications in tracking drug <b>delivery</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Chronic osteomyelitis, or bone infection, {{is a major}} {{worldwide}} {{cause of}} morbidity and mortality, as it is exceptionally hard to treat due to patient and pathogen-associated factors. Successful treatment requires surgical debridement together with long-term, high antibiotic concentrations that are best achieved by local <b>delivery</b> <b>devices,</b> either made of degradable or non-degradable materials. Areas covered: Non-degradable <b>delivery</b> <b>devices</b> are frequently constituted by polymethylmethacrylate-based carriers. Drawbacks are the need to remove the carrier (as the carrier itself may provide a substratum for bacterial colonization), inefficient release kinetics and incompatibility with certain antibiotics. These drawbacks {{have led to the}} quest for degradable alternatives, but also devices made of biodegradable calcium sulphate, collagen sponges, calcium phosphate or polylactic acids have their specific disadvantages. Expert opinion: Antibiotic treatment of osteomyelitis with the current degradable and non-degradable <b>delivery</b> <b>devices</b> is effective in the majority of cases. Degradable carriers have an advantage over non-degradable carriers that they do not require surgical removal. Synthetic poly(trimethylene carbonate) may be preferred in the future over currently approved lactic/glycolic acids, because it does not yield acidic degradation products. Moreover, degradable poly(trimethylene carbonate) yields a zero-order release kinetics that may not stimulate development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains due to the absence of long-term, low-concentration tail-release. ...|$|R
