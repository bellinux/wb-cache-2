25|$|The {{first patent}} for an evaporative-pattern casting process was filed in April 1956, by Harold F. Shroyer. He {{patented}} {{the use of}} foam patterns embedded in traditional <b>green</b> <b>sand</b> for metal casting. In his patent, a pattern was machined from a block of expanded polystyrene (EPS), and supported by bonded sand during pouring. This process {{is now known as}} the full mold process.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} is that lost-foam casting uses an unbonded sand and full-mold casting uses a bonded sand (or <b>green</b> <b>sand).</b> Because this difference is quite small there is much overlap in the terminology. Non-proprietary terms {{that have been used}} to describe these processes include: cavityless casting, evaporative foam casting, foam vaporization casting, lost pattern casting, the castral process, and expanded polystyrene molding. Proprietary terms included Styro-cast, Foam Cast, Replicast, and Policast.|$|E

25|$|When {{casting a}} {{reentrant}} angle, {{instead of using}} a core a cheek can be used. This is a third segment in the flask, {{in addition to the}} cope and drag. This allows the entire mold to be made from <b>green</b> <b>sand</b> and from removable patterns. The disadvantage of this is more mold-making operations are required, but it is usually advantageous when the quantities are low. However, if large quantities of casting are required, it is usually more cost effective to simply use a core.|$|E

2500|$|The {{finished}} patterns can be hot {{glued to}} pre-made pouring basins, runners, and risers {{to form the}} final pattern. The pattern is then coated with a refractory material. The coated pattern (2) is placed in a flask and packed carefully with <b>green</b> <b>sand</b> (4) or a chemically bonded sand.|$|E

2500|$|The {{production}} of castings {{was similar to}} the way they were made {{since the early days of}} founding. [...] Molding was done with <b>green</b> <b>sand</b> until sometime in the 1960s or 1970’s the furan molding process was adopted for medium and large sized castings. [...] Melting continued using the cupola. [...] Most requirements on the foundry were for gray iron, the material normally used in machine tool castings. [...] With the discovery of Ductile iron, the foundry began producing ductile in the 1950s using open ladle treatments or the Gazal porous plug process. [...] Not many machine tool parts were needed in ductile iron.|$|E
2500|$|This {{casting process}} is {{advantageous}} for very complex castings that would regularly require cores. It is also dimensionally accurate, maintains an excellent surface finish, requires no draft, {{and has no}} parting lines so no flash is formed. The un-bonded sand of lost foam casting can be much simpler to maintain than <b>green</b> <b>sand</b> and resin bonded sand systems. [...] Lost foam is generally more economical than investment casting because it involves fewer steps. Risers are not usually required {{due to the nature}} of the process; because the molten metal vaporizes the foam the first metal into the mold cools more quickly than the rest, which results in natural directional solidification. Foam is easy to manipulate, carve and glue, due to its unique properties. The flexibility of LFC often allows for consolidating the parts into one integral component; other forming processes would require the production of one or more parts to be assembled.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{undertakes}} {{an important}} topic of evaluation of effectiveness of SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems, used for {{monitoring and control}} of selected processing parameters of classic <b>green</b> <b>sands</b> used in foundry. Main focus was put on process studies of properties of so-called 1 st generation molding sands in the respect of their preparation process. Possible methods of control of this processing are presented, with consideration of application of fresh raw materials, return sand (regenerate) and water. The studies conducted in one of European foundries were aimed at pointing out how much application of new, automated plant of sand processing incorporating the SCADA systems allows stabilizing results of measurement of selected sand parameters after its mixing. The studies concerned two comparative periods of time, before an implementation of the automated devices for <b>green</b> <b>sands</b> processing (ASMS - Automatic Sand Measurement System and MCM – Main Control Module) and after the implementation.
