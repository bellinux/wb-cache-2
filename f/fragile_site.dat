40|$|Abstract. Aphidicolin-induced common <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> are {{site-specific}} gaps or breaks seen on metaphase chromosomes after partial {{inhibition of}} DNA synthesis. These <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> were first recognized {{during the early}} studies of the fragile X syndrome and are induced by the same conditions of folate or thymidylate stress used to induce the <b>fragile</b> X <b>site.</b> Common <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> are normally stable in cultured human cells. However, following induction with replication inhibitors, they display a number of characteristics of unstable and highly recombinogenic DNA. From the many studies that have cloned and characterized <b>fragile</b> <b>sites,</b> it is now known that these sites extend over large regions, are associated with genes, exhibit late or delayed replication, and contain regions of high flexibility but are otherwise unremarkable in sequence.

5000|$|Cytogenetic {{analysis}} for fragile X syndrome was first {{available in the}} late 1970s when diagnosis of the syndrome and carrier status could be determined by culturing cells in a folate deficient medium and then assessing for [...] "fragile sites" [...] (discontinuity of staining {{in the region of}} the trinucleotide repeat) on the long arm of the X chromosome. This technique proved unreliable, however, as the <b>fragile</b> <b>site</b> was often seen in less than 40% of an individual's cells. This was not as much of a problem in males, but in female carriers, where the <b>fragile</b> <b>site</b> could generally only be seen in 10% of cells, the mutation often could not be visualised.|$|E
50|$|Rare fragile {{sites are}} found in less than 5% of the population, and are often {{composed}} of two- or three-nucleotide repeats. They are often susceptible to spontaneous breakage during replication, frequently affecting neighboring genes. Clinically, the most important rare <b>fragile</b> <b>site</b> is FRAXA, which {{is associated with the}} fragile X syndrome, {{the most common cause of}} hereditary mental retardation.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} common <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> {{has its roots}} in the early {{cytogenetic}} investigations of the fragile X syndrome. Long considered an interesting component of chromosome structure, common <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> have taken on novel significance as regions of the genome that are particularly sensitive to certain forms of replication stress, which are frequently rearranged in cancer cells. In recent years, much has been learned about the genomic structure at <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> and the cellular checkpoint functions that monitor their stability. Recent findings suggest that common <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> may serve as markers of chromosome damage caused by replication stress during early stages of tumorigenesis. Thus, the study of common <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> can provide insight not only into the nature of <b>fragile</b> <b>sites,</b> but also into the broader consequences of replication stress on DNA damage and cancer. However, despite recent advances, many questions remain regarding the normal functional significance of these conserved regions and the basis of their fragility...|$|R

Currently, 84 common <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> {{are listed in the}} GDB Human Genome Database ([URL] Interestingly, common <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> were found within two of the three breakpoint regions involved in the ins(7; 1) rearrangement, at least at the level of resolution afforded by G-banded chromosomes: FRA 7 I in 7 q 36 (aphidicolin-type, GDB: 119213) and FRA 1 C in 1 p 31.2 (aphidicolin-type, GDB: 119170). Precise mapping of the breakpoints would however be needed to determine if these <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> had indeed been the target sites of this chromosomal rearrangement.|$|R

40|$|Human {{chromosomal}} <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> are {{regions of}} the genome that are prone to DNA breakage, and are classified as common or rare, depending on their frequency in the population.

These rearrangements are commonly associated with radiation exposure; however most of the tumors found in adults are not linked to radiation. In this study, we provide structural and biochemical evidence that the RET, CCDC 6, and NCOA 4 genes participating in two major types of RET/PTC rearrangements, are located in common <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> FRA 10 C and FRA 10 G, and undergo DNA breakage after exposure to fragile site-inducing chemicals. Moreover, exposure of human thyroid cells to these chemicals results in the formation of cancer-specific RET/PTC rearrangements.

High frequency of deletions at breakpoints within these <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> {{has been associated with}} many cancers, including breast, lung, and gastric cancers (for review, see [...] ) MicroRNA genes, which are preferentially involved in chromosomal alterations, are frequently located at <b>fragile</b> <b>sites.</b> [...] Chromosomal alterations may lead to deregulation of microRNA, which could be of diagnostic and prognostic significance for cancers. [...] Additionally, the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HPV-16 virus, the strain of human papilloma virus most likely to produce cancer, appear to integrate preferentially in or around <b>fragile</b> <b>sites,</b> and it has been proposed that this is crucial to the development of tumors. [...] <b>Fragile</b> <b>sites</b> have also been implicated in a variety of syndromes (for a review, see [...] ). For example, breakage at or near the FRA11b locus has been implicated in Jacobsen syndrome, which is characterized by loss of part of the long arm of chromosome 11 accompanied by mild mental retardation.

40|$|Abstract Background Gene rearrangements such as {{chromosomal}} translocations {{have been}} shown to contribute to cancer development. Human chromosomal <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> are regions of the genome especially prone to breakage, and have been implicated in various chromosome abnormalities found in cancer. However, there has been no comprehensive and quantitative examination of the location of <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> in relation to all chromosomal aberrations. Results Using up-to-date databases containing all cancer-specific recurrent translocations, we have examined 444 unique pairs of genes involved in these translocations to determine the correlation of translocation breakpoints and <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> in the gene pairs. We found that over half (52 %) of translocation breakpoints in at least one gene of these gene pairs are mapped to <b>fragile</b> <b>sites.</b> Among these, we examined the DNA sequences within and flanking three randomly selected pairs of translocation-prone genes, and found that they exhibit characteristic features of fragile DNA, with frequent AT-rich flexibility islands and the potential of forming highly stable secondary structures. Conclusion Our study is the first to examine gene pairs involved in all recurrent chromosomal translocations observed in tumor cells, and to correlate the location of more than half of breakpoints to positions of known <b>fragile</b> <b>sites.</b> These results provide strong evidence to support a causative role for <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> in the generation of cancer-specific chromosomal rearrangements. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The {{instability}} of CFSs is proposed {{to stem from}} late replication: CFSs are likely to initiate proper replication but slow to complete it, introducing breaks from unreplicated regions of DNA. [...] Late-replication may {{be a result of}} formation of non-B DNA structures like hairpins and toroids that stall the replication fork in AT rich regions, analogous to the proposed mechanism of rare <b>fragile</b> <b>site</b> instability. [...] Ataxia-telengiectasia and Rad3 Related (ATR) checkpoint kinase is required for maintaining stability of CFS under both stressed and normal replicating conditions. [...] Breakage is reduced after treatment with CPT (camptothecin) (without APH), signifying that CPT also has a necessary role in stabilizing CFSs.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} on how mitotic crossover occurs. In the simple crossover model, the two homologous chromosomes overlap {{on or near}} a common Chromosomal <b>fragile</b> <b>site</b> (CFS).

In another model, two overlapping sister chromosomes form a double Holliday junction at a common repeat site and are later sheared {{in such a way that}} they switch places. In either model, the chromosomes are not guaranteed to trade evenly, or even to rejoin on opposite sides thus most patterns of cleavage do not result in any crossover event.

These <b>fragile</b> <b>sites</b> are thought to form hairpin structures on the lagging strand during replication from single-stranded DNA base-pairing with itself in the trinucleotide repeat region.
