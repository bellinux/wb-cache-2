500|$|A {{group of}} four or five {{teenagers}} aged between 14 and 16 claim to have been playing near a cave in Cerro Azul, Panama when the creature emerged. They say that it approached them, and, fearing for their safety, they attacked the creature with sticks and rocks, killing it. They claim that they then threw its corpse into a pool of water before leaving the area. They later returned and took photographs of the creature's corpse, before sending the pictures to Telemetro, a Panamanian television station. Virginia Wheeler, writing for The Sun, claimed that the discovery [...] "sparked fear and confusion" [...] in the town. According to some sources, subsequent photographs were taken of the creature after it had further decomposed; however, doubts have been expressed about whether the later photos were of the same specimen. A few days after the photographs were taken, one of the teenagers gave a different account in an interview with Telemetro Reporta, saying [...] "I was in the river and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> grabbing my legs ... We took it {{out of the water and}} started throwing rocks and sticks at it. We had never seen anything like that." [...] The photographs show a pale creature that is mostly hairless, with a rubbery body. It has [...] "revolting features"; a snub-nose and long arms. Writers for the Huffington Post said that while the head is clearly animal, the torso is [...] "strange", while the limbs are reminiscent of thin human arms. Writers for WBALTV.com compared it to both a [...] "small, portly" [...] version of the alien in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and The Lord of the Ringss Gollum's [...] "long-lost cousin".|$|E

Williams in particular struck a chord with Lewis, who told biographer Rick Bragg in 2014, [...] "I felt something when I listened to that man.

2500|$|O'Neil and all-star Ichiro Suzuki {{developed}} a relationship, with Ichiro attending the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum with O'Neil and seeking O'Neil's {{knowledge of the}} game when the Seattle Mariners would have road games in Kansas City.

2500|$|On 8 July 2003, {{at the age}} of 18, Goodrem was {{diagnosed}} with Hodgkin's lymphoma. She was forced to put all working commitments on hold while undertaking treatment for the disease. In an exclusive interview with The Australian Women's Weekly, Goodrem revealed that, since 2002, she had suffered from a head-to-toe rash, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and a lump on her neck. [...] "I was doing sit-ups when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> pop in my neck. I reached down and I felt a small lump at the base of my throat. It wasn't sore, it wasn't visible, but I could feel it." [...] As part of her treatment, Goodrem undertook chemotherapy, which resulted in the loss of her hair, and radiation therapy. The news of her diagnosis made newspaper and television headlines and an outpouring of support was shown by fans and the general public alike. Goodrem thanked them during The Visualise Tour for all the letters and well wishes she received.|$|E
2500|$|Thérèse's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} a steady decline that she bore resolutely and without complaint. Tuberculosis was the key element of Thérèse's final suffering, but she saw {{that as part of}} her spiritual journey. After observing a {{rigorous}} Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: [...] "Oh! how sweet this memory really is! ... I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it was." [...] The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, [...] "I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the window. I was able to see that I was not mistaken. Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted to have me hear His first call!" ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{talked to}} him (Dr. Scott) for some time, and {{consulted}} him about baby, who was looking thin and weak. (15 July)This evening I was standing outside the door with baby in my arms, talking to the ayah, when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> whiz past my ears. (23 July)A poor woman [...] [...] [...] whose husband [...] [...] [...] had been killed during the siege, came to-day {{to ask me to}} give her a little milk for her only child, who was dying for the want of proper nourishment. It went to my heart to refuse her; but at this time I had only just enough for my own children, and baby could not have lived without it. I think she understood that I would have given her some if I could. (14 August)The children still kept pretty well, though baby grew thinner every day; nothing I gave him seemed to nourish him. (28 August)As we were starting, Major Ouvry brought us some beer to drink, and poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it than I had ever heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in getting him to sleep. Just then the word 'Halt!' was heard, and silence was ordered, all lights to be put out. It was evident some danger was apprehended, and I shall never forget my anxiety lest baby should commence crying again, and perhaps betray our whereabouts; I hardly dared breathe.

6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> of {{the same}} thing for another,--a longing for his welfare, a delight to hear him praised, a charm in his presence,--so strong a feeling for his interest, that were he to go to wrack and ruin, I too, should, after a fashion, be wracked and ruined. But it has not been love either." ...|$|R
2500|$|A bizarre moment {{occurred}} in round 8, whilst in a headlock, Maidana {{appeared to have}} bitten Mayweather's left hand. Mayweather explained this in the post fight, [...] "I didn't know what it was. Something happened and then my fingers were numb. After the eighth round my fingers were numb. I could only use my other hand. He bit me. I realized he bit me. We were tangled {{in the middle of}} the ring and all of a sudden <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> on my left hand." [...] Maidana denied the bite, [...] "Maybe he thinks I'm a dog, but I never bit him. He was rubbing my eyes that round. He may have had his glove in my mouth, but I never bit him." [...] After round 9, Maidana appeared to be confused as he started walking towards the wrong corner. Mayweather immediately ran towards him to point to his corner, much to the amusement of the crowd. Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, [...] "If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can give it to him. I was attacking all the time. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that I was the aggressor. I kept my plan to be aggressive but he kept holding and pushing. I don't want to waste my time with a third fight. I trained with all my heart to get this type of result. This is not fair. There's not reason for another fight." [...] For the sequel, Mayweather earned a minimum of $32 million and Maidana earned a career high $3 million.|$|E

6000|$|... "When I woke my {{hair was}} damp on my forehead, my breath quite still, my heart so cold <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> as if death had indeed been near me and left its chill behind.

6000|$|... "Curious," [...] he muttered, [...] "how blind men are {{to their}} own work. I can detect a weak point in another man's work in a moment, and yet, though <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>something</b> was wrong, I could not {{see what it was}} in my own.

6000|$|He spoke {{like a man}} in earnest--there was {{no denying}} that. Still, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> {{stirring}} uneasily against him in my mind. [...] "Can't you give that other person a name?" [...] I said.|$|E
6000|$|... "A little, perhaps, Mr. Merrick; {{but it is}} unimportant. The {{horses were}} frantic {{at the time and}} {{wrenched}} my wrist viciously as I tried to hold them. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> snap; a small bone, perhaps. But I am sure it is nothing of moment." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{precisely}} {{at this moment}} that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> hard pressed against my hand. With a dexterity that {{was nothing short of}} miraculous, Mr. Parker, who apparently was standing with his hands in his pockets, had suddenly forced one of them through some secret opening in his coat.|$|E
6000|$|... "I really don't know," [...] {{continued}} {{the man in}} the corner blandly, [...] "what it was that interested me in the case from the very first. Certainly it had nothing very out of the way or mysterious about it, but I journeyed down to Brighton nevertheless, as <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>something</b> deeper and more subtle lay behind that extraordinary assault, following a robbery, no doubt.|$|R
5000|$|After {{restarting}} on lap 61, Jeff Gordon veered up {{in front}} of Martin Truex, Jr. and Biffle, and hit the wall to bring out the sixth caution.

60|$|My own {{thoughts}} were sad enough;--yet <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> soothing in the magnificent scenery with which I was surrounded; and thought, in {{the enthusiasm of}} the moment, that had my faith been that of Rome, I could have consented to live and die a lonely hermit {{in one of the}} romantic and beautiful islands amongst which our boat glided.|$|E

60|$|It {{seemed to}} me that my {{intelligence}} confirmed a hope of hers and gave her relief. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> terrible in the balance for Steele.

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>something</b> like {{disappointment}} at her non-recognition, but I consoled {{myself by}} the reflection that people {{often fail to}} recognize other people whom they have seen only in photographs, {{no matter how good}} the likeness may be.

60|$|That look in Rachel's eyes {{remained}} with me.
