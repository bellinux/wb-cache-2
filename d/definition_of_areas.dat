40|$|Many tasks {{performed}} in multiscale visual spaces require {{the user to}} have several foci. Using bimanual interaction, multitouch devices can facilitate the simultaneous definition and exploration of several foci. However, multitouch is rarely used for multifocus navigation, and may limit the interaction to a sequential <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> of interest. We introduce two novel navigation techniques that combine multiple foci and bimanual touch, and therefore enable the isochronic <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> of interest, leading to simultaneous multifocus navigation. SpaceFold folds the visual space in the third dimension, allowing users to bring objects closer to each other. Our technique enables a direct, bimanual manipulation of a folded space and therefore provides high flexibility. PhysicLenses uses multiple magnification lenses to compare objects. Using a physics model, PhysicLenses introduces a general solution for the arrangement of multiple lenses within the viewport. We conducted a controlled experiment with 24 participants to compare the techniques with split screen. The results show that SpaceFold significantly outperformed all other techniques, whereas PhysicLenses was just as fast as split screen...|$|E

Consideration of their overall biological coherence allowed a merging and reformulation of the original six assemblage areas into four coherent zoogeographic regions. Analysis of catch rates in the two major regions so defined suggested that species composition was relatively stable over time. Whether the Grand Bank assemblages correspond to groups of functionally-linked fishes remains an open question of considerable practical and theoretical interest.

One example of tailoring surface properties of one and the same base material may include the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> where cells attach to and deposit extracellular matrix. As for ophthalmological applications, this notion can be traced to de Quensgy's review, published in 1789.

Incomplete biocompatibility of materials used, aside from issues of ethics and patient's acceptance, render problems. Using chemical, physical and nanotechnological methods, features of the material can be dramatically increased. There are different strategies to induce biomimetic cell-tissue-material interaction by modifying the surface on one base material – as well as the use of metallic biomaterials and drug-containing particles. These findings aid the development of next-generation biomaterials where surface-effects are utilized in different therapeutic clinical applications...|$|E
40|$|In this {{presentation}} {{the author}} explores how various modes of cultural practices – popular literature, press accounts, songs – about and by rural migrant workers revolving around ‘dagong’ (打工) have {{changed from the}} late 1980 s on. Eric Florence proposes to conceive of these cultural practices as constitutive of ‘networks of practices and communities of interpretations’ (Chartier) where identity-making and state formation engage and shape each other. The case of hegemonic representations of rural migrant workers in South-China will serve to illustrate how rural migrant workers and the values of adaptability and self-reliance {{they have come to}} embody have become the exemplary categories prefiguring the end of the life-long employment of the state-owned enterprises workers and their necessary bodily and psychological adaptations to labor market competition.

40|$|Previous studies {{recording}} eye {{movements have}} rendered inconclusive findings {{with respect to}} processing differences between familiar and unfamiliar faces. We argue {{that this can be}} attributed to a number of factors that differ across studies: the type and extent of familiarity with stimuli presented, the varying spatial resolution of visual information and/or specifics, the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> of interest subject to analyses, as well as the fact that the time course of scan patterns is often neglected. Here we sought to address these issues by recording gaze patterns in a face recognition task with personally familiar and unfamiliar faces, without predefining areas of interest and investigating potential processing differences at each individual fixation. We found that after a first fixation on the center of mass of the face—suggesting an initial holistic perception—and a subsequent left eye bias, local features were focused and explored more for familiar than unfamiliar faces. Although the number of fixations made did not differ for un-/familiar faces, the locations of fixations began to differ much earlier than when the familiarity decisions were provided. This suggests that without strict time constraints, different types of information are collected relatively early on familiar and unfamiliar faces...|$|E
