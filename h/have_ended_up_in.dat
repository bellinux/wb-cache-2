5|$|On June 30, 2004, then-Mayor Newsom {{pledged to}} fix San Francisco’s {{homeless}} problem within 10 years and clear downtown streets of its widespread homeless population. He stated {{that people who}} were homeless and seriously ill would be given shelter. After 10 years and $1.5 billion, the city relocated 19,500 people off the streets, with 11,363 single adults being housed, and 8,086 people {{being sent to the}} home of a willing family member or friend though the Homeward Bound program. Before the program in 2002, there was a 8,640 generally homeless and 4,535 street homeless population in San Francisco. After the program was initiated, the homeless population dropped 28% by 2005, with a generally homeless population of 6,248 and a 2,655 street homeless population. However, after 2005, the homeless population has stayed approximately the same. In fact, the San Francisco population of homeless rose 3 percent between 2005 and 2013. The percentage of the homeless population in jail was cut in half between 2005 and 2013, which is an indicator that some of the homeless population who would <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> jail were now being housed and treated.|$|E

25|$|Had the war gone on {{a little}} longer for France, {{it is likely that}} all of the Amiot 143M would <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a {{training}} role, having been replaced by more modern bombers such as the Breguet 693. The obsolete plane was never intended to have such an important role come war time, but slow French production made its use necessary - often being pulled from training squadrons to shore up bomber groupes.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the giant}} impact {{model has been}} criticised for being too explanatory; it can be {{expanded}} to explain any future discoveries and as such, is unfalsifiable. Also, many claim {{that much of the}} material from the impactor would <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the Moon, meaning that the isotope levels would be different, but they are not. Also, while some volatile compounds such as water are absent from the Moon's crust, many others, such as manganese, are not.|$|E
25|$|A nation-wide manhunt ensued. Sherman {{was found}} {{four days later}} in Toledo, Ohio. He {{explained}} under interrogation that he had eloped with his girlfriend and denied that the handkerchief was his. He was administered a polygraph test, which he passed, and was later cleared. The handkerchief's real owner, Airman Seymour Sherman of New York City, was eventually found. He {{had been out of}} the country when Suzanne Degnan was murdered. He had no idea how it could possibly <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Chicago and the presence of the handkerchief was determined to be a coincidence.|$|E

25|$|On 28 June, the {{authorities}} stated {{that there were}} known survivors from 106 of the tower's 129 flats; eighteen people among the occupants of these flats were reported as dead or missing presumed dead, whereas most of those killed {{were said to have}} been in the remaining 23 flats between the 11th and 23rd floors. Some people from lower floors may have tried to move up the building, and it is thought a number of people may <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> one flat. Some victims were identified from twenty-six 999 calls made from inside the 23 flats.|$|E
25|$|At {{one point}} in the 19th century, Stanley became one of the world's busiest ports. However, the ship-repair trade began to slacken off in 1876 with the {{establishment}} of the Plimsoll line, which saw the elimination of the so-called coffin ships and unseaworthy vessels that might otherwise <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Stanley for repair. With the introduction of increasingly reliable iron steamships in the 1890s the trade declined further and was no longer viable following the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. Port Stanley continued to be a busy port supporting whaling and sealing activities {{in the early part of}} the 20th century, British warships (and garrisons) in the First and Second World War and the fishing and cruise ship industries in the latter half of the century.|$|E
25|$|Since then, the {{government}} has expropriated other valuable land, mostly the homes of poor and middle-class Equatoguineans. Thousands {{of people have been}} the victims of these seizures, for which very few of them are compensated and in response to which they have no legal recourse. Many of those who have protested these expropriations have been abused and intimidated by soldiers or police. Officially, these lands are seized for public purposes, but in fact they <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the hands of members of the Nguema/Mongomo group, who have built homes or businesses on the properties. In 2003, for example, Le Temps (Geneva) reported on a village in which 75 people lived in abject poverty having been uprooted by the regime from their homes, which had been used to construct a methanol factory without compensation or apology. A 2013 Amnesty report stated that over 1,000 families in the country had been forcibly removed from their homes so that {{the government}} could build roads, luxury homes and hotels, and shopping centers. Many of the homes demolished were in perfect shape, with the vast majority of those living there holding land titles. Despite promises from the government to relocate victims to new homes, to date no one has been compensated in any way.|$|E

25|$|Contraception can be effective, but {{may also}} have health repercussions and can be {{difficult}} (or even impossible) to reverse in some animals. Additionally, some species may lose their reproductive capability entirely if prevented from breeding for a period (whether through contraceptives or isolation), but further study is needed on the subject. Sale of surplus animals from zoos was once common {{and in some cases}} animals <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> substandard facilities. In recent decades the practice of selling animals from certified zoos has declined. A large number of animals are culled each year in zoos, but this is controversial. A highly publicized culling as part of population management was that of a healthy giraffe at Copenhagen Zoo in 2014. The zoo argued that its genes already were well-represented in captivity, making the giraffe unsuitable for future breeding. There were offers to adopt it and an online petition to save it had many thousand signatories, but the culling proceeded. Although zoos in some countries have been open about culling, the controversy of the subject and pressure from the public has resulted in others being closed. This stands in contrast to most zoos publicly announcing animal births. Furthermore, while many zoos are willing to cull smaller and/or low-profile animals, fewer are willing to do it with larger high-profile species.|$|E
25|$|Repression, led by Generals Emil Macri and Nicolae Pleșiță, took various forms. After Dobre spoke, {{the miners}} {{realised}} {{he would be}} targeted and so guarded his residence {{in order to prevent}} his arrest. He was not arrested on the spot; instead, the authorities busied themselves with identifying the miners: engineers and section heads were called to Securitate headquarters to identify them from pictures that had been taken secretly. All strikers who were party members were sanctioned or even removed from the party. Some of the miners were sent back to their native counties. Those who were considered to have been actively violent during the strike were tried and sentenced to 2–5 years' imprisonment through correctional labour for disturbing the public order and offending good morals. In practice, correctional labour meant internal deportation, although some strikers did go to prison. The miners were intimidated and attacked, along with their families in certain cases. Miners who were questioned were insistently asked never again to strike or speak out against the party. Many strikers were called to the Petroșani Securitate building, where they were repeatedly mistreated during interrogations by, for instance, being beaten over the head and having their fingers bound to doors. The ensuing investigation tried to discover where the core of support for the strike lay, and while some 4,000 workers were moved to other mining areas in the following months, others were said to <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> labour camps on the Danube-Black Sea Canal. The main strike leaders disappeared within weeks, with other outspoken miners rounded up piecemeal and dispersed over the next few months. The concessions held long enough for the authorities to break the organisational backbone of the resistance, but eventually most of these were withdrawn and the eight-hour workday imposed, though this was not made official until 1983.|$|E
500|$|On November 27, 1956, he {{fled from}} Budapest to Austria with {{his future wife}} Enid, his sister, brother-in-law, {{and a few others}} after the Soviets invaded the city. He had no prior {{intention}} to leave Hungary until he learned from his mother that the Hungarian Secret Police were looking for him. Racz said if they found him, [...] "That would have meant the end of my dreams to become a doctor. Perhaps I would <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> prison. Not that I had done anything but many other people ended up in prison following 1956 without committing any crime." [...] He arrived in the Austrian town of Eisenstadt where buses were waiting to take refugees to their new homes. Racz chose the bus to England, and he along with his family and other members of his group were transported to a military base in the Midlands.|$|E

500|$|Oswald's {{head was}} interred in Durham Cathedral {{together}} with the remains of Cuthbert of Lindisfarne (a saint with whom Oswald became posthumously associated, although the two were not associated in life; Cuthbert became bishop of Lindisfarne {{more than forty years}} after Oswald's death) and other valuables in a quickly made coffin, where it is generally believed to remain, although there are at least four other claimed heads of Oswald in continental Europe. One of his arms is said to <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Peterborough Abbey later in the Middle Ages. The story is that a small group of monks from Peterborough made their way to Bamburgh where Oswald's uncorrupted arm was kept and stole it under the cover of darkness. They returned with it to Peterborough and in due time a chapel was created for the arm - Oswald's Chapel. This - minus the arm - can be seen to this day in the south transept of the cathedral. When creating this chapel the monks of Peterborough had thought of how they had acquired it and built into the chapel a narrow tower - just big enough for a monk to climb to the top by an internal stair and stand guard over Oswald's Arm 24 hours a day, every day of the year. [...] The monk had to stand because the tower is not large enough for him to sit - sitting could lull him to sleep - and they knew what could happen when no-one was watching.|$|E

2500|$|Fa Zheng and Zhuge Liang did {{not share}} the same moral beliefs {{but they had a}} good working {{relationship}} because of their common goal, which was to serve Liu Bei well. Zhuge Liang was very impressed with Fa Zheng's brilliance. In 221, before the Battle of Xiaoting, many of Liu Bei's subjects advised their lord against going to war with his former ally, Sun Quan, who seized Jing Province from Liu in 219 and executed Liu's general Guan Yu. Liu Bei ignored them and proceeded with his campaign against Sun Quan. In the following year, he lost to Sun Quan's forces at the Battle of Xiaoting and had to retreat to Baidicheng, where he died in 223. Zhuge Liang sighed, [...] "If Fa Xiaozhi was still alive, he could have prevented our lord from going on this eastern campaign; even if our lord did go on this campaign, he wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> this disastrous situation (if Fa Xiaozhi was with him)." ...|$|E
2500|$|The camp {{officials}} {{contracted with}} an unscrupulous undertaker, C. H. Jordan, who sold {{some of the}} bodies of Confederate prisoners to medical schools and had the rest buried in shallow graves without coffins. Some bodies reportedly were even dumped in Lake Michigan, only to wash up on its shores. Levy states that bodies may <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the lake because they were initially buried in shallow graves along the shore and were exposed due to erosion. Jordan shipped 143 bodies to Kentucky, according to official records, and claimed to have sent 400 bodies {{to the families of}} the deceased during the course of the war. Many dead prisoners' bodies initially were buried in unmarked paupers' graves in Chicago's City Cemetery (located on the site of today's Lincoln Park). In 1867 their bodies were reinterred at what is now known as Confederate Mound in Oak Woods Cemetery ( [...] south of the former Camp Douglas).|$|E
2500|$|Modern documentaries {{suggest that}} there {{may not have been}} a [...] "Last Stand" [...] as {{traditionally}} portrayed in popular culture. Instead, archaeologists suggest that, in the end, Custer's troops were not surrounded but rather overwhelmed by a single charge. This scenario corresponds to several Indian accounts stating Crazy Horse's charge swarmed the resistance, with the surviving soldiers fleeing in panic. Many of these troopers may <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a deep ravine 300–400 yards away from what is known today as Custer Hill. At least 28 bodies (the most common number associated with burial witness testimony), including that of scout Mitch Bouyer, were discovered in or near that gulch, their deaths possibly the battle's final actions. Although the marker for Mitch Bouyer has been accounted for as being accurate through archaeological and forensic testing, it is some 65 yards away from Deep Ravine. Other archaeological explorations done in Deep Ravine have found no human remains associated with the battle. According to Indian accounts, about 40 men made a desperate stand around Custer on Custer Hill, delivering volley fire. The great majority of the Indian casualties were probably suffered during this closing segment of the battle, as the soldiers and Indians on Calhoun Ridge were more widely separated and traded fire at greater distances for most of their portion of the battle than did the soldiers and Indians on Custer Hill.|$|E
