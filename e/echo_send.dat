50|$|Putnam was {{the first}} person in the US to use {{artificial}} reverberation using echo chambers for commercial recording. (The BBC's broadcasting studios in Savoy Hill, London, used for both broadcasting and commercial recording, were the first anywhere to use purpose made echo chambers with both <b>echo</b> <b>send</b> and returns and cue sends and multi-band EQ, and recording to disc and tape as early as 1931.) He also developed the first US multi-band audio equalizer, and with his company Universal Recording Electronics Industries (UREI), he was responsible for the development of classic recording studio equipment including the UREI 1176LN, the UREI Time Align Monitor, and the Universal recordings consoles, which soon became standard equipment in studios all over America. Alongside his friend Les Paul, Putnam was also involved in the early development of stereophonic recording and he founded several major independent recording studios in Chicago, Las Vegas, Hollywood and San Francisco.|$|E

50|$|Full Echo {{or simply}} <b>Echo</b> <b>sends</b> each message to every {{neighbor}}. Every neighbor {{does the same}} unless it's the target node of a specific message. In smaller networks, the message should reach every peer. Nodes can be client, server, or both.|$|R
50|$|The Half <b>Echo</b> <b>sends</b> {{the message}} {{only to a}} direct neighbor. If {{configured}} correctly, the target node will not disperse the received message to other nearby nodes. This allows two neighbors {{to communicate with each}} other on dedicated sockets. That is, data from other nodes will not traverse the restricted socket. Though always authenticated and encrypted, the nodes can exclude others from knowing about the communications.|$|R
2500|$|ICMP Echo Request attacks (Smurf attack) can be {{considered}} one form of reflected attack, as the flooding host(s) <b>send</b> <b>Echo</b> Requests to the broadcast addresses of mis-configured networks, thereby enticing [...] hosts to <b>send</b> <b>Echo</b> Reply packets to the victim. Some early DDoS programs implemented a distributed form of this attack.|$|R
30|$|In this formula, the Echo Time of the {{previous}} <b>Echo</b> packet and <b>Send</b> Time of the next packet are combined in order to derive an estimate round-trip time (eRTT).|$|R
50|$|The first {{recording}} studio built at 827 Folsom Street in San Francisco was {{a brand new}} location for Coast Recorders, one of many {{recording studio}}s Bill Putnam operated in U.S. cities. Putnam leased the Folsom location from its aging owner, John Vitlin, a Russian immigrant who co-founded Global Merchandising, an import/export company in San Francisco. To replace an obsolescent building housing Coast Recorders on Bush Street, Putnam designed a two-floor studio complex containing all the necessary record company elements under one roof: three recording and mixing rooms, a mastering room with a disc-cutting lathe, a high-speed tape duplication room, and office space for label and studio management. Unusually, five <b>echo</b> <b>sends</b> were available for use throughout the facility, two of them stereo echo chambers normaled (connected by default) to the main two studios. Francis Ford Coppola leased space {{on the second floor}} for his American Zoetrope film studio. The first session was taped on June 23, 1969, in Studio B, and the grand opening was held later that November. Less than a year later, on September 15, 1970, Putnam sold majority control of the building to Columbia Records, a division of CBS.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is an old}} Indian legend, {{he tells}} her. Years ago two lovers from {{different}} tribes met here. Their families were enemies, sort of a Romeo and Juliet affair. They were discovered and sentenced to die, but their spirits still live. When a lover gives the call, their spirits <b>echo</b> it, <b>sending</b> it on until it reaches the one he loves. Rose Marie is moved by the beauty of it. She stands {{at the edge of}} the lake and gives the haunting call. Sergeant Bruce takes it up and sings the classic [...] "Indian Love Call".|$|R
60|$|They {{were silent}} after that, and ran thus for fully an hour, at nearly {{the top of}} their speed. But Leif {{sometimes}} checked his men, and sometimes urged them on, so that they fancied he was chasing with full intent to run the Skraelingers down. When the fugitives showed signs of flagging, he uttered a tremendous roar, and his men <b>echoed</b> it, <b>sending</b> such a thrill to the hearts of the Skraelingers that they seemed to recover fresh wind and strength; then he pushed after them harder than ever, and so managed that, without catching or killing one, he terrified them almost out of their wits, and ran them nearly to death.|$|R
50|$|Loop-back (LB): Loop-back {{messages}} {{otherwise known}} as MAC ping are Unicast frames that a MEP transmits, they are similar in concept to an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) <b>Echo</b> (Ping) messages, <b>sending</b> Loopback to successive MIPs can determine {{the location of a}} fault. Sending a high volume of Loopback Messages can test bandwidth, reliability, or jitter of a service, which is similar to flood ping. A MEP can send a Loopback to any MEP or MIP in the service. Unlike CCMs, Loop back messages are administratively initiated and stopped.|$|R
50|$|Cloudstreet {{is framed}} by many key events in world history, {{including}} World War II, the Korean War and {{the assassination of}} John F. Kennedy., where Australia was, for the most part, comfortable and conservative, characterised by backyard barbecues, by wives - who were no longer needed for the war effort - consigned to the home, and by {{the growth of the}} Australian dream of owning a new home. World events influence the Lambs and Pickles, but distantly, like an <b>echo</b> that <b>sends</b> ripples across the surface of their lives. The novel focuses on the domestic, and this serves as the filter through which history is measured. The most prominent historical character within Cloudstreet is the Nedlands monster, whose real name is Eric Edgar Cooke, a serial killer. The Australian Dictionary of Biography writes that Winton's novel Cloudstreet embodied the social impact of Cooke's crimes. There was a change in personal and household security and a loss of the relaxed style of living.|$|R
500|$|Going back to {{the drawing}} board, Raindancer {{reformed}} as three-piece band called 'Reel' after John Canham departed. Their bass player Simon Blight later departed from the band and the music business, before changing their name to 'Real'. During this time in 1994 they recruited Taka Hirose via an advert in Loot, which Taka placed himself. The band then changed their name to Feeder, named after Grant's pet goldfish. They won their recording contract with <b>Echo</b> after <b>sending</b> a demo tape, and then completed the deal after an employee from the label witnessed one of the band's gigs. A track called [...] "Don't Bring Me Down", which featured on the demo appeared as a b-side on the [...] "Day In Day Out" [...] single, albeit a different version to the demo recording. After signing with The Echo Label in 1994, the group toured with Scarborough band B.l.o.w. who at the time, recently formed from the ashes of Little Angels. It was this tour where Feeder met Mark Richardson for the first time.|$|R
30|$|Similarity-based trust {{management}} system (SBTMS): A similarity-based trust {{management system}} (SBTMS) checks for bogus safety event detection in node using similarity index. It assigns trust to one-hop neighbour in the network. This scheme also enhances decision-making power using trust and utilizing echo protocol to check reaction of reporting vehicle. This scheme is feasible {{when there is}} more meeting time between vehicles for communication to build a trust system. The second limitation is when a safety event elevator (SEE) <b>sends</b> <b>echo</b> safety event alert to a safety event reporter (SER). If SER does not reply due to signal loss or out of range communication from SEE, it is also considered as malicious data [81].|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} telecommunications, echo is {{the display}} or return of sent data at {{or to the}} sending end of a transmission. Echo can be either local <b>echo,</b> where the <b>sending</b> device itself displays the sent data, or remote echo, where the receiving device returns the sent data that it receives to the sender (which is of course simply no local echo {{from the point of}} view of the sending device itself). That latter, when used as a form of error detection to determine that data received at the remote end of a communications line are the same as data sent, is also known as echoplex, echo check, or loop check. When two modems are communicating in echoplex mode, for example, the remote modem echoes whatever it receives from the local modem.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Belonging", Sierra's past, {{and the story}} of how she came to be in the Dollhouse, is explored. It emerges that Sierra is an Australian artist called Priya Tsetsang, who sells her work by Venice Beach in Los Angeles. In the course of this she meets Nolan Kinnard (first seen in [...] "Needs"), a wealthy doctor who {{develops}} a fascination with both Priya and her artwork. In an attempt to seduce Priya, Nolan commissions a large painting from her and arranges an elaborate showing of the finished artwork in his house. To further impress her he employs the services of the Dollhouse, which <b>sends</b> <b>Echo</b> and Victor to the showing, both imprinted to enthuse about Nolan to Priya. However, Priya is discomforted by the lavish party, and more interested in Victor than in Nolan. She attempts to leave with Victor, which culminates in a confrontation with Nolan. Rejecting his increasingly threatening advances, Priya leaves the party.|$|R
40|$|Clustering {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} challenges in data mining. We identified three core problems which turn finding a natural grouping of a data set into a difficult task: First, clusters may exist in arbitrarily oriented subspaces of various dimensionality (also known as correlation clusters). Secondly, the cluster structure may be hidden by noise and outliers. Finally, the number, size and density of the clusters is usually unknown which makes the parametrization of existing approaches very difficult. In this paper, we address these three problems by combining ideas from information theory and blind signal source separation. Our algorithm is inspired by the idea of an active sonar that reveals hidden objects by <b>sending</b> <b>echo</b> pings with various frequencies and from different directions. Analogously, our algorithm SONAR very efficiently generates primitive pre-clusters and considers exactly these pre-clusters as echo pings. Each echo of a ping is a mixture of the signals of the true clusters. Independent component analysis (ICA) allows us to decompose the mixed signals into statistically independent response patterns. We combine the idea of signal de-mixing with the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to allow an outlier-robust and parameter-free detection of the true clusters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the following assets of SONAR: Outlier-robust detection of correlation clusters of various density and subspace orientation, requiring no difficult input parameters, and scalability to large data sets...|$|R
30|$|Upstream {{detection}} {{becomes more}} difficult and complex because of the loose coupling of <b>send</b> and <b>echo</b> packets. The <b>send</b> packets received from the upstream have little relation with the echo packets returned back to an intruder’s computer. Unlike downstream detection, computing the length of an upstream connection precisely {{would be much more}} difficult. However, upon the observation of user’s keystroke behavior which can be modeled as Poisson distribution, we found that, as an interactive process for an intrusion, the intruder needs to think and pause after his/her input to determine what to do next upon the responses. We can explore the relations among the signals: user’s behavior (signal 1), user’s input (signal 2), and the response (signal 3). Through carefully processing these three signals, it is feasible to identify if an upstream connection is long or short. The third open problem is to apply signal processing technique to stepping-stone intrusion detection. Chaffed packets are hard to be filtered completely and make the existing stepping-stone intrusion detecting approaches not successful. Due to different distributions, chaffed packets can be treated as a signal which is different from regular traffic packets. So a chaffed connection can be considered as a signal which contains regular traffic packets and chaffed packets. The signal is in time domain. If we can use FFT or some other methods to transfer the time domain signal to be a frequency domain signal, it is feasible to use signal processing technique to remove the chaffed packets in frequency domain.|$|R
40|$|The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) {{on board}} ICESat {{spacecraft}} measures the surface height (altimetry) via {{the time of}} flight of its 1064 nm laser pulse. The GLAS laser transmitter produces 6 ns wide pulses with 70 mJ energy at 1064 nm at a 40 Hz rate. The altimeter receiver consists of a telescope, aft optics, a silicon avalanche photodiode, and electronic amplifiers. The transmitted and echo pulse waveforms are digitized at 1 GHz rate. The laser pulse time of flight is determined on the ground from the two digitized pulse waveforms and their positions in the full waveform record (about 5. 4 ms ong) by computing the pulse centroids or by curve fitting. The GLAS receiver algorithms in on board software selects the two waveform segments containing the transmitted and the <b>echo</b> pulses and <b>sends</b> them to ground. The probability of echo pulse detection and the accuracy of time of flight measurement depend on the received signal level, the background light within the receiver field of view, the inherent detector and amplifier noise, the quantization of the digitizer, and some times by cloud obscurations. A receiver model has been developed to calculate the probability of detection and accuracy of the altimeter measurements with these noise sources. From prelaunch testing, the minimum detectable echo pulse energy for 90 % detection probability was about 0. 1 fj/pulse onto the detector. Such a receiver sensitivity allows GLAS to measure the surface height through clouds with optical density less than 2. The echo pulse energy required to achieve 10 cm ranging accuracy {{was found to be}} about 3 times higher than the minimum detectable signal level. The smallest single shot range measurement error, which was determined by ranging to a fixed target with strong echo pulses and no background light, was 2 to 3 cm. The maximum linear response echo pulse energy was 10 fJ/pulse for the strongest echo signals, assuming a Lambertian scattering snow surface, clear sky atmosphere transmission, and no pulse width spreading due to surface slopes. Results from the initial 38 days of GLAS operation on-orbit with Laser 1, showed the echo pulse energies varied, as expected, over a wide dynamic range due to the variability of atmosphere transmission and Earth surface characteristics. The receiver was able to reliably detect the ground surface echoes and measure time of flight under such dynamic conditions, except when there were dense clouds. When over Antarctica, the echo pulse energies were several times stronger than predicted. This suggests that the 1064 nm backscattering from the snow pack and ice-sheet &ce are not completely Lambertian but is somewhat peaked at opposit. ion. With Laser 1, the peak amplitude of the echo pulses from flat ice sheets under clear sky conditions exceeded the linear response range of the receiver, causing some pulse waveform distortion due to saturation. We have characterized the effects of receiver saturation on the time of flight, pulse width, and pulse energy measurements for flat surface by testing a night spare detector in the lab with simulated echo pulses. A data processing algorithm that minimizes the errors due to saturation for these measurements are described...|$|R
