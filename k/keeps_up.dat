25|$|Before {{embarking on}} a hunt, clans go through {{elaborate}} prehunt social rituals involving nuzzling, body rubbing and homo- and heterosexual mounting. Dholes are primarily diurnal hunters, hunting {{in the early hours}} of the morning. They rarely hunt nocturnally, except on moonlit nights, indicating they greatly rely on sight when hunting. Though not as fast as jackals and foxes, they can chase their prey for many hours.

Most chases are short, lasting only 500 m. When chasing fleet-footed prey, they run at a pace of 30mph. Dholes frequently drive their prey into water bodies, where the targeted animal's movements are hindered.|$|E
