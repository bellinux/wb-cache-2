5|$|At age 16 Mendelssohn {{wrote his}} String Octet in E-flat major, the first work which showed the full power of <b>his</b> <b>genius.</b> This Octet and his Overture to Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, {{which he wrote}} a year later in 1826, are the best-known of his early works. (Later, in 1842, he also wrote {{incidental}} music for the play, including the famous Wedding March.) The Overture is perhaps the earliest example of a concert overture– that is, a piece not written deliberately to accompany a staged performance, but to evoke a literary theme in performance on a concert platform; this was a genre which became a popular form in musical Romanticism.|$|E
5|$|Late 18th-century critics {{felt that}} Smart's madness {{justified}} them in ignoring his A Song to David, {{but during the}} following century Robert Browning and his contemporaries considered his condition {{to be the source}} of <b>his</b> <b>genius.</b> It was not until the 20th century, with the rediscovery of Jubilate Agno (not published until 1939), that critics reconsidered Smart's case and began to see him as a revolutionary poet, the possible target of a plot by his father-in-law, a publisher, to silence him.|$|E
5|$|Van Meegeren {{felt that}} <b>his</b> <b>genius</b> had been misjudged, {{and he set}} out to prove to the art critics that he could not only copy the style of the Dutch masters in his paintings, but produce a work of art so {{magnificent}} that it would rival the works of master painters. He moved with Jo to the South of France and began preparations for this ultimate forgery, which took him six years, from 1932 to 1937. In a series of early exercises, he forged works by Frans Hals, Pieter de Hooch, Gerard ter Borch, and Johannes Vermeer. Finally, he chose to forge a painting by Vermeer as his masterpiece. Vermeer had not been particularly well-known until {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century; his works were both extremely valuable and scarce — only about 35 had survived.|$|E
60|$|I never {{admired the}} {{character}} of the first Napoleon; but I recognize <b>his</b> great <b>genius.</b> <b>His</b> work, too, has left its impress for good on the face of Europe. The third Napoleon could have no claim to having done a good or just act.|$|R

5|$|McMaster has {{received}} accolades for its research strengths, {{particularly in the}} field of health sciences. For five years in a row, McMaster has ranked second in for biomedical and health care research revenues by the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada. The Faculty of Health Science oversees $130 million a year in research, much of that research conducted by scientists and physicians who teach in the medical school. The Faculty of Health Sciences operates several research institutes, including the Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health, and the Population Health Research Institute. A McMaster research group led by David Sackett and later Gordon Guyatt had been credited for establishing the methodologies used in evidence-based medicine. In November 2010, researchers at the Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute turned clumps of human skin into blood cells, which may help alleviate the shortage of blood donors. A portion of Albert Einstein's brain is preserved and held for medical research at the McMaster brain bank. Researchers there have identified differences in his brain that may relate to <b>his</b> <b>genius</b> for spatial and mathematical thinking.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other late self-portraits, in Self Portrait with Two Circles, Rembrandt, {{with one}} hand on his hip, appears confrontational and even defiant. The {{impression}} is that of a master solemnly asserting <b>his</b> <b>genius.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Smithsonian Institution {{has long}} {{been aware of the}} work and {{theories}} of Professor Lowe and we have found his statements scientifically sound. It is with great pleasure and satisfaction that we welcome proof of <b>his</b> <b>genius.</b> We shall follow the outcome of his plan with interest.|$|E
50|$|Just before war was declared, Macrae's {{name was}} put forward to Holland who {{arranged}} to meet him. Holland considered that Macrae {{would make a good}} second in command for Jefferis: He saw Macrae as a capable administrator who could keep <b>his</b> <b>geniuses</b> in order. Macrae joined the War Office as a civilian and Holland saw to it that Macrae got a commission in October 1939 (backdated to 1 September).|$|R

5000|$|A playmaker and striker, Haller {{was noted}} for his {{exceptional}} technique and finesse, yet also for his weight problems, which troubled him throughout his career. In Italy Haller is {{considered as one}} of the great wings of the sixties and the defining player of Bologna. He remains famed for his [...] "irresistible dribbling, <b>his</b> innate <b>genius,</b> <b>his</b> great eye for goal, his charisma." ...|$|R
25|$|Benedict Wong as Trey, the navigator. Boyle saw Wong in Dirty Pretty Things (2002). Wong's character, Trey, {{was a child}} prodigy {{who created}} a {{computer}} virus that brought down one-sixth of the world's computers. As a result, Trey is recruited into the space program so <b>his</b> <b>genius</b> could be applied more beneficially.|$|E
25|$|Mighty Aphrodite is a 1995 American {{romantic comedy}} film written, {{directed}} by, and co-starring Woody Allen, alongside Mira Sorvino, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Rapaport, and F. Murray Abraham. The screenplay {{was inspired by}} the story of Pygmalion and is about Lenny Weinrib's (Allen) search for <b>his</b> <b>genius</b> adopted son's biological mother, ultimately finding that she is a dim-witted prostitute named Linda Ash (Sorvino).|$|E
25|$|Genius was the {{essential}} spirit and generative power – {{depicted as a}} serpent or as a perennial youth, often winged – within an individual and their clan (gens (pl. gentes). A paterfamilias could confer his name, a measure of <b>his</b> <b>genius</b> and a role in his household rites, obligations and honours upon those he fathered or adopted. His freed slaves owed him similar obligations.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the first}} goal proved highly {{controversial}} in England, Maradona's second goal was nevertheless recognized {{all over the}} world for its brilliance. A notable example of the English appreciation of <b>his</b> <b>genius</b> occurred in a 2002 poll conducted by Channel 4, where the UK public voted Maradona's performance sixth in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments. Outside the Estadio Azteca a statue of Maradona scoring the goal was erected to commemorate the moment.|$|E
25|$|At Gräfenberg, {{to which}} the fame of Priessnitz drew people of every rank and many countries, medical men were {{conspicuous}} by their numbers, some being attracted by curiosity, others by the desire of knowledge, but the majority by the hope of cure for ailments which had as yet proved incurable. Many records of experiences at Gräfenberg were published, all more or less favorable to the claims of Priessnitz, and some enthusiastic in their estimate of <b>his</b> <b>genius</b> and penetration.|$|E
25|$|In private life, Bezborodko was {{a typical}} Catherinian, corrupt, licentious, conscienceless and self-seeking. But he was {{infinitely}} generous and affectionate, and spent his enormous fortune liberally. His banquets were magnificent, his collections of pictures and statues unique in Europe. He was the best friend of his innumerable poor relatives, and the Maecenas of all the struggling authors of his day. Sycophantic he might have been, but he was neither ungrateful nor vindictive. His patriotism is as indisputable as <b>his</b> <b>genius.</b>|$|E
5000|$|From 1841, <b>his</b> {{creative}} <b>genius</b> [...] "exploded" [...] and {{he developed}} in a few highly active months his writings and his personality, that would be admired throughout Europe.|$|R
2500|$|Frederick II [...] "the Great" [...] is {{best known}} for <b>his</b> {{military}} <b>genius,</b> <b>his</b> reorganization of Prussian armies, his battlefield successes, his enlightened rule, and especially his making Prussia one of the great powers, as well as escaping from almost certain national disaster at the last minute. He was especially a role model for an aggressively expanding Germany down to 1945, and even today retains his heroic image in Germany.|$|R
50|$|The Hortus Animæ and Horæ Diurnæ, {{published}} in London, and several beautiful works brought out at Mechelin and Tournai, {{bear witness to}} <b>his</b> inventive <b>genius.</b> <b>His</b> Liber Vitæ, {{a record of the}} benefactors of St Bernard Abbey, is magnificently illustrated with pictures of the arms and patron saints of the benefactors. He also left unpublished The Armorial Bearings of English Cardinals and The Arms of the Cistercian Houses of England.|$|R
25|$|He was {{progressive}} and anti-progressive at once, and likewise at once both {{a critic of}} the Zeitgeist and its most interesting expression. He was, in effect, stranded on a beachhead of his own thinking between past and future. That he was not able, by himself, to fashion a bridge between them is neither surprising, nor, in the end, disappointing. We should see this failure, rather, as an aspect of <b>his</b> <b>genius.</b> He both was and was not a man of his time.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of his}} {{religious}} reforms, Augustus revived, subsidised and expanded the Compitalia games and priesthoods, dedicated to the Lares of the vici (neighbourhoods), to include cult to his own Lares (or to <b>his</b> <b>genius</b> as a popular benefactor). Thereafter, the Lares Compitales were known as Lares Augusti. Tiberius created a specialised priesthood, the Sodales Augustales, dedicated to {{the cult of the}} deceased, deified Augustus. This priestly office, and the connections between the Compitalia cults and the Imperial household, appear to have lasted {{for as long as the}} Imperial cult itself.|$|E
25|$|Mozart's Singspiele, Die Entführung aus dem Serail (1782) and Die Zauberflöte (1791) were an {{important}} breakthrough in achieving international recognition for German opera. The tradition {{was developed in}} the 19th century by Beethoven with his Fidelio, inspired by the climate of the French Revolution. Carl Maria von Weber established German Romantic opera in opposition to the dominance of Italian bel canto. His Der Freischütz (1821) shows <b>his</b> <b>genius</b> for creating a supernatural atmosphere. Other opera composers of the time include Marschner, Schubert and Lortzing, but the most significant figure was undoubtedly Wagner.|$|E

25|$|They came fifth for a {{third time}} in four years in 1979, with the {{following}} four weeks of Finals in 1979 proving to be a turning point for the club and the beginning of their great success in the 1980s. Inspired by Mortimer and led by Test captain George Peponis, the Bulldogs disposed of Cronulla, Wests and Parramatta to make the Finals with some of Mortimer's tries leaving the public in awe of <b>his</b> <b>genius.</b> St George won the Grand Final 17-13 with the Bulldogs staging a great second half comeback after being down 17-2 at the break.|$|E
25|$|He was {{admitted}} to the Protestant European School, like his brothers and sisters, in January 1902. He continued his studies at this school which was run by the Baptist Mission up to 1909 and then shifted to the Ravenshaw Collegiate School. Here, we was ridiculed by his fellow students because he knew very little Bengali. The day Subhas {{was admitted}} to this school, Beni Madhab Das, the headmaster, understood how brilliant and scintillating <b>his</b> <b>genius</b> was. After securing the second position in the matriculation examination in 1913, he got admitted to the Presidency College where he studied briefly.|$|E
25|$|Gauss died in Göttingen, (then Kingdom of Hanover and now Lower Saxony) on 23 February 1855 and is interred in the Albani Cemetery there. Two {{individuals}} gave eulogies at his funeral: Gauss's son-in-law Heinrich Ewald and Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen, who was Gauss's {{close friend}} and biographer. His brain was preserved and was studied by Rudolf Wagner who found its mass to be 1,492grams (slightly above average) and the cerebral area equal to 219,588 square millimeters (340.362 square inches). Highly developed convolutions were also found, which in the early 20th century were suggested as the explanation of <b>his</b> <b>genius.</b>|$|E
