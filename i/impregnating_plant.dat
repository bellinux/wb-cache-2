40|$|Vacuum {{impregnation}} (VI) is a {{unit operation}} {{that allows the}} introduction of solutions into the porous structure of plant tissues. The plant tissue is immersed in the solution of interest and is then subjected to partial vacuum, causing the removal of air from the tissue. When the atmospheric pressure is restored, the solution is drawn into the tissue, replacing the air. In this way, most of the air spaces are filled by the solution, although small air pockets may still remain. VI has been extensively studied, {{particularly with regard to}} the modification of the physico-chemical properties and sensory attributes of food products. These studies include texture enhancement, enrichment of fruits and vegetables with probiotics or micronutrients, the modification of sensory attributes, and the extension of shelf life by pH reduction. VI has also been widely used as a method of pre-treatment prior to, e. g., minimal processing, freezing, or drying of fruit and vegetables. However, {{little is known about the}} metabolic consequences of <b>impregnating</b> <b>plant</b> tissue with different substances using VI. The short-term metabolic response of impregnating spinach leaves with different substances (calcium lactate, sucrose, citric acid and ascorbic acid) was investigated using isothermal calorimetry at 5 ºC, 2 h after VI treatment. The greatest increase in metabolic heat production was observed after impregnation with calcium lactate. This may be the result of metabolization of the lactate, as well as the mobilization of starch. The different impregnation solutes led to specific changes in the carbohydrate composition of the leaves during 4 days of storage, due to sugar metabolization, glucose-to-fructose interconversion and starch mobilization in the plant tissue. The effect on the nitrate content of spinach following impregnation with sucrose was also investigated. The results showed that a small amount of sucrose (5 g/ 100 ml) significantly decreased the nitrate concentration. Exogenously supplied sucrose reduced the nitrate concentration in the leaves by almost 70 % during 3 days of storage at 8 ºC, compared to non-impregnated leaves. Evidence showed that sucrose was metabolized during storage of the leaves, and that the reduction in nitrate was due to the use of sucrose as a substrate for the metabolization of stored nitrate and for respiration. Thus, VI could be beneficial in the food industry in reducing the nitrate content of spinach, leading to the improvement of nutritional characteristics. The influence of impregnation with different substances on the metabolic activity of spinach leaves in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) was investigated. The gross metabolic activity of the impregnated spinach leaves changed significantly, depending on the impregnation solute and treatment temperature. Sucrose induced the highest metabolic heat production at 21 ºC, whereas calcium lactate led to the highest metabolic activity at 5 ºC. The high metabolic activity of sucrose-impregnated leaves was reflected by the high oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production measured in the packaged product stored at 21 ºC. However, this was not reflected by the changes in atmosphere inside the calcium lactate-impregnated, packaged products. The incongruity between calorimetric and atmospheric measurements may be the result of the different time scales of the measurements. The results obtained in this work have helped provide a better understanding of how impregnation of spinach leaves affects their metabolic activity. The findings could be of importance in the food industry as they provide a better understanding of how spinach leaves could be metabolically affected by a certain type of compound, thus influencing specific quality characteristics and their respiration upon packaging...|$|E

40|$|Goal and Background. As a {{consequence}} of the implementation of EU Directive 98 / 8 /EC into national law in June 2002, all biocidal products will be subjected to an authorization procedure. Condition for issue of an authorization is that the product or its residues do not exert unacceptable effects on human and animal health or on surface water and groundwater. Hence, among other issues, impact of wood preservatives on groundwater is to be assessed. Focus is particularly on <b>impregnating</b> <b>plants</b> with open-air storage sites for treated wood. Methods. Based on already in-use versions of the leaching model PELMO, an advanced version (MC-PELMO 3. 0) was developed with a specific focus on estimating groundwater contamination under storage sites at wood preserving facilities in Germany. The model processes twenty-two different leaching scenarios that were derived from twelve characteristic soil profiles representing pedological regions in Germany along with recorded meteorological data from nine weather stations These data are related to geographic distribution of industrial wood preserving activity. The model calculates statistic probabilities of concentrations of wood preservatives in seepage water beneath timber storage sites of regions to be selected by the user. Results and Discussion. The reports provided by MC-PELMO 3. 0 include mean average concentrations, 55 to 99 percentiles, and single maximum concentrations for each of the scenarios. The results can be related to the total area of Germany, its forest area or to the density of preservation activity in various regions. Beside concentrations of the parent compounds, those of degradation products may be calculated for the seepage water. Conclusion. The described model is a particularly useful tool for comparative assertion of various wood preservative products under aspects of the exposure of groundwater resources. Comparative assertion is a new element within EU-chemicals policy, for the first time materialized in the biocidal products directive 98 / 8 /EC. Furthermore, the results of model calculations identify vulnerable regions in Germany for which appropriate risk management measures have to be taken in order to protect groundwater from contamination...|$|R

Foraging efficiency {{was determined by}} measuring the remaining food in artificial food patches {giving-up densities: GUDs) from two experiments. In the first experiment, we placed patches in different microhahitat types (cover vs open) and at varying distances from cover. This experiment was conducted during three moon stages (waxing, full, waning). We found that the rodents had higher GUDs {lower foraging efficiency) in the open microhabitat. The distance from nearest shelter had a marginally significant positive effect on GUDs. GUDs were higher in hoth microhabitat types during the waxing and full phases, hut decreased sharply once the moon hegan to rise after sunset. These results are likely due to higher prédation risk away from cover and in more illuminated environments.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to {{have a better understanding of}} plant-ant-symbiotic fungus interaction focusing on foraging behavior of Atta sexdens rubropilosa workers during plant selection. Physical and chemical substrate factors were approached which can have a role on foraging material selection for symbiotic fungus cultivation besides defoliating localization in artificial plants. Tested hypothesis was that besides chemical characteristics physical stimulus and leaves localization in a plant also play a very important role in substrate selection by A. sexdens rubropilosa workers. Different shape and thickness material was used (different leaves, paper leaves with different shapes and thickness <b>impregnated</b> in <b>plant</b> extract and artificial plants). The aim was to verify the existence of physical and chemical resistance, leaf palatability and defoliating localization. Wood plants Actinostemon communis, Alchornea triplinervea, Croton floribundus, Faramea cyanea, were offered to workers and evaluated 4 according to mechanical resistance of cut and palatability. Each plant was offered individually in big disc shape (2, 5 cm diameter), small disc shape (0, 5 cm diameter) and whole leaves. Other studies were carried out for detecting physical and chemical stimulus through simulated cuts and impregnation of plant extract in paper leaves with different thickness making it possible to evaluate the combinations between physical and chemical substrate characteristics. Defoliating localization in plants was studied when offering artificial plants with four levels where either wood plant or Ligustrum sp. leaves was attached. Defoliating intensity was measured by the number of fallen leaves by ants. In order to study wood plant attractiveness small disc shaped leaves (0, 5 cm diameter) were offered at the same time for ants in laboratory.

60|$|Here as elsewhere, however, Darwin's {{principle}} {{does not}} spring spontaneous, like Athene {{from the head}} of Zeus, a goddess full-formed, uncaused, inexplicable: it arises gradually by a slow process of development and modification from the previous investigations of earlier biologists. At the close of the last century, in the terrible year of upheaval 1793, a quiet German botanist, Christian Konrad Sprengel by name, published at Berlin his long unheeded but intensely interesting work on the 'Fertilisation of Flowers.' In the summer of 1789, while all Europe was ablaze with the news that the Bastille had been stormed, and a new era of humanity begun, the calm and peaceful Pomeranian observer was noting in his own garden the curious fact that many flowers are incapable of being fertilised without the assistance of flying insects, which carry pollen from the stamens of one blossom to the sensitive surface or ovary of the next. Hence he concluded that the secretion of honey or nectar in flowers, the contrivances by which it is protected from rain, the bright hues or lines of the corolla, and the sweet perfume distilled by the blossoms, are all so many cunning devices of nature to ensure fertilisation by the insect-visitors. Moreover, Sprengel observed that many flowers are of one sex only, and that in several others the sexes do not mature simultaneously; 'so that,' said he, 'nature seems to intend that no flower shall be fertilised by means of its own pollen.' Indeed, in some instances, as he showed by experiments upon the yellow day lily, <b>plants</b> <b>impregnated</b> from their own stamens cannot be made to set seed at all. 'So near,' says his able successor, Hermann Müller, 'was Sprengel to the distinct recognition of the fact that self-fertilisation leads to worse results than cross-fertilisation, and that all the arrangements which favour insect-visits are of value to the plant itself, simply because the insect-visitors effect cross-fertilisation!' As in most other anticipatory cases, however, it must be here remarked that Sprengel's idea was wholly teleological: he conceived of nature as animated by a direct informing principle, which deliberately aimed at a particular result; whereas Darwin rather {{came to the conclusion that}} cross-fertilisation as a matter of fact does actually produce beneficial results, and that therefore those plants which varied most in the direction of arrangements for favouring insect-visits were likely to be exceptionally fortunate in the struggle for existence against competitors otherwise arranged. It is just the usual Darwinian substitution of an efficient for a final cause.|$|R
