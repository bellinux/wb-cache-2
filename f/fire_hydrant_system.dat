2500|$|Early pumpers used cisterns as {{a source}} of water. Water was later put into wooden pipes under the streets and a [...] "fire plug" [...] was pulled out of the top of the pipe when a suction hose was to be inserted. Later <b>systems</b> {{incorporated}} pressurized <b>fire</b> <b>hydrants,</b> where the pressure was increased when a fire alarm was sounded. This was found to be harmful to the system and unreliable. Today's valved <b>hydrant</b> <b>systems</b> are kept under pressure at all times, although additional pressure may be added when needed. Pressurized hydrants eliminate much of the work in obtaining water for pumping through the engine and into the attack hoses. Many rural fire engines still rely upon cisterns or other sources for drafting water into the pumps.Steam pumper came in to use in the 1850s.|$|R

The Arena also has numerous fire doors that automatically lock in the case of a fire, so preventing the further spreading of a fire.|$|E

5000|$|A {{flushing}} hydrant is a hydrant that is {{used for}} [...] a water line of silt, rust, debris, or stagnant water. Many water utilities use standard <b>fire</b> <b>hydrants</b> for flushing their lines.

Flushing hydrants typically only have one outlet, in contrast to <b>fire</b> <b>hydrants,</b> which normally have two or three.

2500|$|A <b>fire</b> <b>hydrant</b> is {{an active}} fire {{protection}} measure, {{and a source of}} water provided in most urban, suburban and rural areas with municipal water service to enable firefighters to tap into the municipal water supply to assist in extinguishing a fire. Before the existence of <b>fire</b> <b>hydrants,</b> a primitive <b>fire</b> suppression system known as [...] "fire plugs" [...] consisted of burying a wooden water pipe (often no more than a hollowed out log) along the streets for teams of bucket brigades to form and fight fires. Wooden pegs would then need to be hammered over fire plugs in order to stop the flow of water. The invention of a post or pillar type <b>fire</b> <b>hydrant</b> is generally credited to Frederick Graff Sr., Chief Engineer of the Philadelphia Water Works around the year 1801. It had a combination hose/faucet outlet and was of [...] "wet barrel" [...] design with the valve in the top. It is said that Graff held the first patent for a <b>fire</b> <b>hydrant,</b> but this cannot be verified {{due to the fact that}} the patent office in Washington D.C. was burned to the ground in 1836 where all patent records from that time period were destroyed in the process. In 1863, Birdsill Holly invented the modern version of the <b>fire</b> <b>hydrant.</b> While Holly was only one of many involved in the development of the <b>fire</b> <b>hydrant,</b> innovations he introduced are largely responsible for the <b>fire</b> <b>hydrant</b> taken for granted today.
