5|$|Music played in-game has a {{synthetic}} <b>feel</b> <b>with</b> increased pace and introduction of strings during tense moments, with a looping style endemic to video games. Overtly cinematic music, with stronger orchestral and choral elements, appears in cutscenes. The soundtrack {{was released on}} September 23, 1998, under the King Records label.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, Llantwit {{developed}} into a dormitory town and grew about 15 times in size to accommodate the Royal Air Force at St Athan. Despite its modernization and rapid growth, it retains its pre-modern <b>feel</b> <b>with</b> its narrow winding streets, high walls, old town hall and gatehouse, and several inns and houses dated to the 16th century. Llantwit Major railway station on the Vale of Glamorgan Line was reopened in June 2005. In 2014, it was rated {{one of the most}} attractive postcode areas to live in Wales.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan had}} been to take the songs out on the road, but no new tour transpired. Thus, Bush {{deliberately}} aimed for a live-band <b>feel,</b> <b>with</b> less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and {{which would have been}} too difficult to re-create on stage. The result alienated some of her fan base, who had enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions, but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, {{producer}} Ilya Salkind {{convinced his}} father Alexander {{to buy the}} rights to Superman. They hired Mario Puzo to pen a two-film script, and negotiated with Steven Spielberg to direct, though Alexander Salkind rejected him as Jaws went over budget. Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman signed on to play Jor-El and Lex Luthor respectively, and Guy Hamilton was hired to direct. However, Brando was faced with an obscenity lawsuit in Italy over Last Tango in Paris, and Hamilton was unable to shoot in England as he had violated his tax payments. The Salkinds hired Richard Donner to direct the film. Donner hired Tom Mankiewicz to polish the script, giving it a serious <b>feel</b> <b>with</b> Christ-like overtones.|$|E
5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that <b>feel,</b> <b>with</b> Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E

25|$|By contrast, the 2005 album Made in China was {{recorded}} in Bellows Falls, Vermont and Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was released on her own new record label, Ye Olde Records.

25|$|The University of North Florida has six {{areas of}} on-campus housing, {{three of which}} offer similar, suite/efficiency-like rooms: The Osprey Crossings, Osprey Landing, and Osprey Cove; each of these are {{designed}} for triple occupancy and currently house two to three residents, with some accommodating individual rooms for disabled students. Additionally, Osprey Hall offers more of a traditional, dorm-like environment with double occupancy along with communal bathrooms and showers. Osprey Village offers an apartment-like <b>feel</b> <b>with</b> either double or quadruple occupancy. Osprey Hall, The Crossings, Osprey Landing, and Osprey Cove are designated for freshmen although upperclassmen live there as well, while Osprey Village is an upperclassmen residence.|$|E
25|$|For {{the audio}} and sound {{engineering}} on the tour, DiGiCo SD7 consoles {{were used by}} mixing specialists Andy Meyer and monitor engineers Matt Napier and Sean Spuehler. Since Madonna wanted to have an authentic <b>feel</b> <b>with</b> the live sound, Spuehler mixed her vocal effects and then added it to the house consoles. During {{the duration of the}} concert, the singer ventures {{into the middle of the}} crowd as the runway approaches, resulting in the spill of the microphone in her hand constantly changing. The sound crew employed timecode to achieve this, whereby like the lighting and the choreography, the sound feed also changed depending on where the singer was onstage. All the musicians accompanying Madonna wore in-ear monitor, with additional monitoring for musical director/keyboardist Kevin Antunes, a thumper for drummer Brian Frasier-Moore and sidefills for the dancers. All the inputs from the different personnel including Madonna were fed into the SD7 console. A Multichannel Audio Digital Interface(MADI) was used to record all the shows to a digital audio workstation in RAID drives. They were archived into four terabyte backup disks.|$|E

25|$|The Sotenos {{are one of}} the {{families}} of ceramic artisans that have made Metepec an important production center in Mexico. Metepec is known for sun decorations for walls, guitar-strumming mermaids, skeletal figures, animals of Noah's Ark along with other items, which attract buyers from Mexico City and Toluca. The municipality is a suburb of industrial Toluca but the historic center still maintains its rural <b>feel</b> <b>with</b> tile roofs and stone paved streets. The making of pottery in the Valley of Toluca goes back at least 1000years due to rich clay deposits. In the colonial period, Metepec become a ceramics center, blending European and indigenous traditions, mostly specializing in black and green tableware, toys, religious figure and candlestick holders. Diego Rivera is credited with introducing new color schemes to a pottery making family in the 1940s with other workshops following suit. Around the same time, Metepec potters became to transform candleholders into tree sculptures which have become the town’s best known exports. The original trees were relatively plain with limited motifs, mostly the Garden of Eden. Over time, they became more elaborate, more colorful and larger.|$|E
25|$|Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is an action-adventure, stealth game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective. The game features three main cities; Havana, Kingston, and Nassau, which reside under Spanish, British, and pirate influence, respectively. It also features 50 other individual locations to explore, including atolls, sea forts, Mayan ruins, sugar plantations, and underwater shipwrecks, with a 60/40 balance between land and naval exploration. It has a more open world <b>feel,</b> <b>with</b> missions {{similar to those found}} in Assassin's Creed, as well as fewer restrictions for the player. The world opens up sooner in the game, as opposed to Assassin's Creed III, which had very scripted missions and did not give players freedom to explore until the game was well into its first act. The player will encounter jungles, forts, ruins, and small villages and the world is built to allow players much more freedom, such as allowing players to engage, board, and capture passing ships and swimming to nearby beaches in a seamless fashion. In addition, the hunting system has been retained from Assassin's Creed III, allowing the player to hunt on land, and fish in the water, with resources gathered used to upgrade equipment.|$|E
25|$|The ducks, geese, and swans are small- to large-sized {{birds with}} a broad and {{elongated}} general body plan. Diving species vary from this in being rounder. Extant species {{range in size from}} the cotton pygmy goose, at as little as 26.5cm (10.5in) and 164g (5.8oz), to the trumpeter swan, at as much as 183cm (6ft) and 17.2kg (38lb). The wings are short and pointed, and supported by strong wing muscles that generate rapid beats in flight. They typically have long necks, although this varies in degree between species. The legs are short, strong, and set far {{to the back of the}} body (more so in the more aquatic species), and have a leathery <b>feel</b> <b>with</b> a scaly texture. Combined with their body shape, this can make some species awkward on land, but they are stronger walkers than other marine and water birds such as grebes or petrels. They typically have webbed feet, though a few species such as the Nene have secondarily lost their webbing. The bills are made of soft keratin with a thin and sensitive layer of skin on top (which has a leathery feel when touched). For most species, the shape of the bill tends to be more flattened to a greater or lesser extent. These contain serrated lamellae which are particularly well defined in the filter-feeding species.|$|E

500|$|By nightfall on 12 May, Guderian's XIX. Panzerkorps {{rolled into}} Sedan. Guderian {{reported}} {{there was no}} sign of the enemy. With the city itself secured, Guderian would now have to strike south, across the defended rear behind Sedan, which in turn was protected by a large bunker complex located on Marfee ridge, a piece of high ground covering the Sedan-Meuse river to the south. But there were three fundamental choices. He could obey tactical necessity and protect the bridgeheads against a French counter-attack from the south; he could strike west towards Paris with his Corps; or he could carry out the dash to the Channel. Remembering the Chief of Operations, 1st Panzer Division, Walther Wenck's saying, [...] "Hit with your fists, don't <b>feel</b> <b>with</b> your fingers!", Guderian decided on the last option.|$|E
500|$|... "The She", {{named after}} a nightclub that the Deals' brother used to visit, has been {{described}} as having a funky <b>feel,</b> <b>with</b> a start-and-stop rhythm of bass and drums.

Cibula mentioned that the [...] "creepy/cool ... sound [...] the characteristic Kim Deal familiar/strange lyrics: 'Sorrow blowin' through the vents / I'm over Houston / You're over the night we met.'" [...] Kim Deal plays every instrument on [...] "Too Alive" [...] and both sisters sing. Moores noted the track's buoyant feel and the steady strumming style of Deal's guitar.
