25|$|Some {{research}} has found {{the average length of}} abstinence for bulimics in OA was significantly higher than the average length for binge eaters. Paradoxically, bulimics were also found to attend fewer meetings, and had less of a commitment to write their thoughts and feelings down daily. However, the frequency of relapse for bulimics and binge eaters was not significantly different. The differences may be explained by the predictable nature of the bulimic cycle. Other {{research has}} found binge eaters in OA had better success than bulimics. Most OA members who have reported negative experiences in the program are anorexic. This could be caused by OA's focus on problems of <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> rather than too little. Some OA practices, such as refraining from eating certain kinds of foods, are antithetical in the case of anorexics. Though, most anorexics have a previous history of bulimia.|$|E

[...] JC's Girls {{members have been}} criticized for dressing like sex workers, a look that Veitch said is intended to help women in the sex industry identify with the group. A Baptist minister from San Bernardino, California criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging women in the sex industry to quit, and quoted , a Bible verse that states that a person cannot serve two masters. In response to the idea that strippers should quit their jobs before attending a church, Veitch said, [...] "Do we ask gluttons to stop <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> before they come to church?"

500|$|All hay and {{concentrated}} feeds {{must be kept}} dry and free of mold, rodent feces, {{and other types of}} contamination that may cause illness in horses. Feed kept outside or otherwise exposed to moisture can develop mold quite quickly. [...] Due to fire hazards, hay is often stored under an open shed or under a tarp, rather than inside a horse barn itself, but should be kept under some kind of cover. [...] Concentrates take up less storage space, are less of a fire hazard, and are usually kept in a barn or enclosed shed. [...] A secure door or latched gate between the animals and any feed storage area is critical. [...] Horses accidentally getting into stored feed and <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> at one time is a common but preventable way that horses develop colic or laminitis. [...] (see Illnesses related to improper feeding below) ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, a Baptist {{minister}} from San Bernardino, California criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging {{women in the}} sex industry to quit. He commended Veitch [...] "for her zeal and desire to reach the lost for Christ", but asked, [...] "How can you stay in the industry and {{have a relationship with}} God?", and quoted , a Bible verse that states that a person cannot serve two masters. In response to the idea that strippers should quit their jobs before attending a church, Veitch said, [...] "Do we ask gluttons to stop <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> before they come to church?" [...] At the 2006 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, photographer Michael Grecco photographed Veitch, Albee, and Huerter and included the image in his 2007 book [...] In the image caption, he called the trio a [...] "devout Christian trinity".

500|$|MacDonald {{indicates}} Potter {{was particularly}} {{sensitive to the}} openings and closings of her books (she insisted Benjamin Bunny end with the term [...] "rabbit-tobacco", for example), and, in the Flopsy Bunnies, the opening reflects her flair for the elevated diction sometimes encountered in her other books: [...] "It is said the effect of <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> lettuce is 'soporific'." [...] Though the word 'soporific' is not generally encountered in literature for young children, Potter is aware of her audience's limitations and not only defines the word immediately but places it in context: [...] "I have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then I am not a rabbit." [...] She not only defines the word, but introduces rabbits as her subject. The line does not draw attention to itself (though Potter is intruding herself into the narrative), but rather gives the tale a conversational tone or {{a sense of the}} story being told aloud by a narrator. Because she immediately brings the audience's attention back to the rabbits, there is no danger she will become a character in the tale, and she is invisible through the remainder of the tale.|$|E
