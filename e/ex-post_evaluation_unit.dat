Predictions made by Impact Assessments (IAs) could be verified during <b>ex-post</b> legislative <b>evaluations,</b> while <b>ex-post</b> <b>evaluations</b> in turn could recommend amendments to be studied in future IAs. This article combines a dataset of 309 <b>ex-post</b> legislative <b>evaluations</b> (2000 - 2014) and a dataset of 225 IAs of legislative updates (2003 - 2014) to show how many <b>ex-post</b> <b>evaluations</b> of the Commission use IAs and vice versa. This way, it explores if the Commission’s rhetoric of a ‘regulatory cycle’ holds up in practice. Building on the literature of evaluation use, we formulate the hypotheses that the timeliness, quality and focus of the IAs and evaluations are key explanations for use. Our results show that so far only ten <b>ex-post</b> <b>evaluations</b> have used IAs of EU legislation, while thirty three IAs have used <b>ex-post</b> legislative <b>evaluations.</b> Using Fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis, we find that timeliness is a necessary condition {{of the use of}} <b>ex-post</b> <b>evaluations</b> by IAs, suggesting that for the regulatory cycle to function properly, it is crucial to complete an <b>ex-post</b> <b>evaluation</b> before an IA is launched.

We start from a description of the Italian Partial ACE scheme to show main determinants of the choice between debt and equity. Then, we construct an econometric model to explain the choice to use the Italian Partial ACE by Italian corporations in year 2000. Applying this model to a sample containing more than 16. 000 observations and controlling also for the tax position of the firm and for heterogeneity of legal types we find that while, as expected, profitability is positively related to the probabil-ity to use the Italian Partial ACE in year 2000 this probability is related in an unexpected way to the interest rate.

The potential benefits and shortcomings of participation were explicitly considered when designing a DPP which integrates three tools: an opinion poll and two deliberative arenas – the “stakeholder dialogue” and the “citizens’ jury”. The <b>ex-post</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the test confirmed ex-ante design choices. The DPP was effective and learning was generated: the use of understandable techniques for deliberation and assessment helped participants to generate an unambiguous final result which was based on the “hybridisation” of the alternative schemes proposed to the participants {{at the beginning of the}} procedure. The “last word” given to the citizens’ jury avoided that the most powerful stakeholders may capture the DPP. Only a “frustration” effect was clearly generated because of the limited involvement of the Municipality of Bari, thus confirming that the involvement of the relevant Authority is an essential requisite for successful participation. We suggest that the generation of new knowledge and learning could be further assured by the participation of citizens and stakeholders to the definition of the alternatives they will assess later...|$|R

30|$|Because {{foresight}} {{projects are}} carried out in specific macro- and microeconomic conditions, numerous factors determine their execution and the effects they bring. Therefore, several criteria {{that can be used}} for the evaluation of such undertakings can be identified. Some attempts to evaluate foresight projects have been undertaken, and selected examples concerning the evaluation of foresight projects at a national and transnational levels are presented in this article. The main rationale for selecting the case studies was whether the aspect of foresight impact was taken into account in the course of their evaluation. All studies, apart from one case, concern <b>ex-post</b> <b>evaluation.</b>|$|R
40|$|Has the Kyoto Protocol induced carbon leakage? We {{conduct the}} first {{empirical}} <b>ex-post</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the Protocol. We derive a theoretical gravity equation for the CO 2 content of trade, {{which accounts for}} intermediate inputs, both domestic and imported. The structure of our new panel database of the carbon content of sectoral bilateral trade flows allows controlling for the endogenous selection of countries into the Kyoto Protocol. Binding commitments under Kyoto have increased committed countries' embodied carbon imports from non-committed countries by around 8 % and the emission intensity of their imports by about 3 %. Hence, Kyoto has indeed led to leakage...|$|R
