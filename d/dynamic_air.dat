Therefore, the focus of the MWP shifted to a more scientific approach to the airflow phenomena, with the goal of discovering new ways to increase overall aviation safety.

HAZMAT-3 responds to the bulk of HAZMAT requests, and carries bulk absorbent and spill control supplies for hydrocarbon spills (ruptured fuel tanks, heating oil spills, etc.).

40|$|Air {{bearings}} {{have been}} widely used in ultra-precision positioning stages due to the property of nearly zero friction or wear. Small vibration of the bearing reduces the overall moving and positioning precision of the stage and hampers its applications in fabrication facilities requiring nanometer moving and positioning precision. In order to improve system precision, knowledge of the <b>dynamic</b> characteristics of <b>air</b> bearings is the first and crucial step. However, it is still a challenge to set up an accurate <b>dynamic</b> model for <b>air</b> bearings due to the system complexity. In this article, a novel method for the <b>dynamic</b> modeling of <b>air</b> bearing is proposed, which takes into account the dynamics in both the moving direction and the supporting direction. An ultra-precision positioning dual stage is investigated using the proposed dynamic modeling method. This stage has two sets of air bearings and can be used in integrated circuit fabrication equipments. Moreover, dynamic behaviors of the ultra-precision positioning dual stage are studied and compared with experimental results to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method...|$|R

Investigations in a large-scale pipeline apparatus lead {{to a better understanding of}} the physical processes associated with the <b>dynamic</b> performance of <b>air</b> valves. Float type air valves of nominal diameter of 50 and 100 mm were tested in geometrically similar 200 and 500 mm test sections, to allow for the assessment of dynamic scale effects and the development of dimensionless parameter groups and dynamic scale laws. The approach in the determination of the <b>dynamic</b> performance of <b>air</b> valves was to measure their response to flow acceleration/ decelerations, which are imposed upon the valve. In this way, the air valve behaviour following events like system start-up, pump trip and pipe rupture is simulated.

This type of plastron is an intermediate state between Leidenfrost vapor layers on superheated surfaces and the equilibrium Cassie-Baxter wetting state on textured superhydrophobic surfaces. We show that such a plastron can be sustained {{on the surface of}} a centimeter-sized superhydrophobic sphere immersed in heated water and variations of its <b>dynamic</b> behavior with <b>air</b> saturation of the water can be regulated by rapid changes of the water temperature. The simple experimental setup allows for quantification of the air flux into the plastron and identification of the air transport model of the plastron growth. Both the observed growth dynamics of such plastrons and millimeter-sized air bubbles seeded on the hydrophilic surface under identical air-supersaturated solution conditions are consistent with the predictions of a well-mixed gas transport model. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
