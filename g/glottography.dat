40|$|The term <b>glottography</b> is {{familiar}} from Pulgram (1976) and {{is equivalent to}} Gelb’s (1952) phonography. The term is problematic, since it is rarely made clear how a writing system is held to represent a spoken language, and how glottographic systems exist alongside nonglottographic ones. This paper examines <b>glottography</b> from the particular perspective of archaic or proto-cuneiform (first attested ca. 3300 B. C. E.). After clearing up some fundamental confusions, we offer four symptoms of glottographic writing. We then consider the relation between glottographic and non-glottographic writing, associate the former with the act of reading and the latter with verbalizing, and conclude by suggesting that <b>glottography</b> is best viewed as a single subsystem of written language...|$|E
30|$|Nowadays, {{different}} medical techniques {{based on}} the direct examination of vocal folds such as laryngeal videoendoscopy [1, 2], <b>glottography</b> [3], and stroboscopy [4] are used by medical specialists. But these methods have two main drawbacks. Firstly, they are invasive. They may cause patients feel uncomfortable and consequently to distort the actual signal. Secondly, they are expensive to buy and maintenance fees are high.|$|E
40|$|Impedance <b>glottography,</b> or electroglottography, is a noninvasive {{technique}} for monitoring the {{variation of the}} degree of contact between the vibrating vocal cords during voice production. Electrical impedance is sensed using a pair of electrodes placed {{on either side of the}} larynx, by injecting a low-level high-frequency current. A wide-band impedance detector circuit has been developed using a precision rectifier based on voltage feedback clamping amplifier and approximately linear-phase lowpass filter. The circuit can be used for obtaining electroglottogram signal for diagnosis of vocal fold disorders...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a novel {{application of the}} 'single line scanning' of the vocal fold vibrations (kymography) in singing pedagogy, particularly in a specific technical voice exercise: the 'messa di voce'. It aims at giving the singer relevant and valid short-term feedback. A user-friendly automatic analysis program makes possible a precise, immediate quantification of the essential physiological parameters characterizing the changes in glottal impedance, concomitant with the progressive increase and decrease of the lung pressure. The data provided by the program show a strong correlation with the hand-made measurements. Additional measurements such as subglottic pressure and flow <b>glottography</b> by inverse filtering can be meaningfully correlated with the data obtained from the kymographic images...|$|E
40|$|In our {{research}} program {{we have chosen}} to use four different methods of analysis: fundamental frequency distribution analysis, long- time- average spectrum analysis (LTAS), a kind of aperiodicity measurement, and acous-tic <b>glottography.</b> Results from the three first mentioned methods will be discussed here. These methods all accept tape recorded speech material as input. The tape recordings of the voices were made in a sound treated room using a two- channel tape recorder with stepwise variable gain con-trols. One channel records the signal from a small microphone mounted on a spectacle frame worn by the speaker {{in order to keep}} a constant mouth- to-micr ophone distance. The second channel records the signal from a contact midrophone put on the throat below the larynx. The step-wise amplifier control and a fixed mouth- to-microphone distance allows measurements of the SPL of the recorded speech. Filtered noise can be fed to the patient's ears through headphones which stimulates the patient to increase the vocal effort. However, as yet the influence of increase...|$|E
40|$|In {{clinical}} examination, {{vocal fold}} vibrations are usually visualized during a stationary sustained phonation. This experimental condition {{is easy to}} handle, but {{does not reflect the}} voice in every day life. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the laryngeal mechanism during a non-stationary phonation. A monotonous pitch raise paradigm (MPRP) as an example of a non-stationary phonation is considered. An extension of the biomechanical two-mass-model (2 MM) with time-dependent parameters is developed to model vocal fold vibrations and belonging physiological parameters. The procedure iteratively adapts the extended 2 MM via frequency and amplitude matching to real vibrations of vocal fold edges, obtained from an endoscopic investigation with a high-speed camera system (high-speed <b>glottography,</b> HGG). In simulations the proposed fitting scheme is capable to approximate the non-stationary oscillation of the vocal folds. The verification of the algorithm is exemplarily demonstrated with a synthetically generated data set and recordings of a female subject with normal voice. The time-dependent model parameters adjusted by the proposed inversion algorithm are estimates of the adaptation of the vocal folds during a non-stationary phonation.

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{experimental}} phonetic investigation of phonological voicing oppositions - specifically, those involving preaspiration {{as found in}} Icelandic, Scottish Gaelic, and Irish. Three main aspects of these oppositions are dealt with. - The first involves the production 8 f these contrasts. Productions by native speakers of the three languages were monitored using techniques including electroaerometry and photoelectric <b>glottography.</b> Specific attention is directed to the durational correlates of the opposition, and how these vary across languages and for different phonetic environments, including stress variation. The differences and similarities between contrasts which involve preaspiration and those which involve postaspiration are discussed in some detail. In considering production aspects of these oppositions, interest focusses also on the laryngeal mechanisms which control voicelessness and aspiration (pre- and post-). Glottographic data presented suggests that the nature and the amplitude of glottal gesture for a voiceless or aspirated stop is very precisely tailored to the prevailing aerodynamic conditions. The second aspect considered {{is that of the}} historical development of these contrasts. Past hypotheses are discussed in some detail, and a more phonetically-based alternative is proposed. The general tendencies of change which affect voicing oppositions and which have traditionally been termed lenition processes are also considered. Suggestions are made regarding the phonetic motivation of such changes, suggestions based on existing research as well as on certain results of this study. Thirdly, the perception of these oppositions is considered. Perceptual experiments are repotted using synthetic and computeredited natural speech stimuli. In the first instance, these tests bear on specific questions regarding the perception of preaspirated stops, which arise out of the production data in the earlier chapters. In addition, the broader question of the perception of voicing contrasts is discussed. A serious problem facing the researcher in this area (and in the area of. linguistic contrasts generally) is that of how the simple binary linguistic percept is arrived at from the large number of potentially relevant cues. The question arises as to whether there is a single dominant cue or whether voicing detection involves separate monitoring of the various cues which have been postulated in the literature. A hypothesis is proposed to the effect that the linguistic percept depends on a judgement regarding the relative ratio of two properties of a larger, Vowel+Consonant unit. The multiplicity of postulated cues may be an artifact of an excessively segmental approach; these seemingly disparate cues may be seen instead to be feeding into a cumulative decision based on a syllable-type unit...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHigh-speed videoendoscopy is {{the most}} {{promising}} approach to directly assess vocal-fold vibrations. Yet, its application to clinics {{is limited by the}} vast amount of data that has to be evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. There is need to reduce the dimensionality of the spatio-temporal information, and to efficiently represent the high-speed data in a compact, handy and lossless way. In this issue, automatic segmentation of glottal area is a major challenge. Recently, several advanced methods have been proposed for glottal segmentation, based either on a region-growing approach (Yan et al., 2006; Lohscheller et al., 2007; Demeyer et al., 2009) or on an active-contours framework (Marendic et al., 2001; Allin et al., 2004; Moukalled et al., 2009). The choice of segmentation method is not trivial, as it depends on image quality, the features profile of the object of interest, and computational demands. In this paper, we wish to explore the possibilities and limitations of an active-contours based method for automatic segmentation with no user intervention. The basic principle of active-contours models, also know as snakes, is to consider the object detection as a problem of energy minimization. An energy-minimizing spline is guided by external constraint forces and influenced by image forces, that pull it towards desired features such as lines and edges (Kass et al., 1988). The dynamic glottal-edge detection applied here is based on the local region-based framework proposed by Lankton and Tannenbaum (2008). It allows the foreground and background to be modeled in terms of smaller local regions, instead of representing them with global statistics. The main contributions of the proposed approach are the following. First, a precise way of localizing the glottal area is presented. The proposed scheme provides a tight mask surrounding the object of interest, information on the maximum area threshold and information on {{the presence or absence of}} glottal area. Second, local-based active contours are used to resolve convergence failure in global energy for objects with heterogeneous statistics. The method allows the contour to split and merge, thus dealing efficiently with cases where the glottal area consists of more than one regions, as is often the case in pathological vocal-fold vibrations. Furthermore, the method is fully automatic and it does not require human intervention. Parameter selection is performed automatically, based on the sequence statistics and empirical observations performed on a wide range of high-speed sequences. Finally, the proposed method is not data-dependent. The method has been tested on a database of 60 high-speed sequences of 501 frames (resolution of 256 * 256 interlaced pixels and duration equal to 125 msec), recorded from two subjects performing several speech and singing tasks (mainly glides, and sustained phonation with different voice qualities). The high-speed images were recorded at a frame rate of 4000 fps, simultaneously to audio and electroglottographic signals. The 60 sequences were verified by visual inspection and manually corrected when needed. Phonovibrograms were computed for qualitative validation (Lohscheller et al., 2008). Manual verification resulted on average in +/- 10 pixels modifications, which corresponds to less than 1 % of the average glottal area. These errors mainly come from detection failure in the posterior or anterior parts of the glottal area. In 38 / 60 sequences, the amount of mean error relative to glottal opening and closing instants was less than 2 pixels, which validates the use of the segmentation results for glottal features estimation. A comparison has been conducted on glottal-parameters (fundamental frequency, open quotient) estimated either on electroglottographic signal or on the extracted glottal area (de Cheveigné and Kawahara, 2002; Henrich et al., 2004, respectively), using the electroglottographic signal as reference. Only 5 / 60 sequences exhibited mean differences in f 0 greater than 0. 5 semitones. A good match was found for open quotient in half of the sequences.
