5000|$|Before 1800 a {{great deal}} of coal was left in places as {{extraction}} was still primitive. As a result, in the deep Tyneside pits (300 to 1,000 ft deep) only about 40 percent of the coal could be extracted. The use of wooden pit props to support the roof was an innovation first introduced about 1800. The critical factor was circulation of air and control of dangerous explosive gases. At first fires were burned {{at the bottom of the}} [...] "upcast" [...] shaft to create air currents and circulate air, but replaced by fans driven by steam engines. Protection for miners came with the invention of the Davy lamp and Geordie lamp, where any firedamp (or methane) burnt harmlessly within the lamp. It was achieved by restricting the <b>ingress</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> with either metal gauze or fine tubes, but the illumination from such lamps was very poor.

Reactor components constructed of graphite will, at high temperatures, produce exothermic reactions in the presence of oxygen.

40|$|A {{statistical}} {{assessment of}} deep intrusions <b>of</b> stratospheric <b>air</b> {{based on records}} of two adjacent mountain stations of the northern Alps at different altitudes is presented. Ten years recordings of beryllium activity, ozone concentrations, and relative humidity at the Zugspitze summit (2962 m a. s. l.), as well as ozone and relative humidity at the Wank summit (1776 m a. s. l., 15 km distance) were analyzed. 195 stratospheric intrusion events could unambiguously be identified for the Zugspitze, whereas 85 intrusion events were found for the Wank. No event could be reliably identified at the valley floor station at Garmisch-Partenkirchen (740 m a. s. l.). There is a pronounced seasonal cycle of the frequency of events showing highest activity during fall, winter, and spring, whereas low activity is found during summer. By assessing average events {{it was possible to}} infer the monthly mean enrichment rate of the lower tropospheric ozone concentration by deep stratospheric intrusions. It was fou nd that at least 3 per cent of the ozone burden is replaced every month on an annual average. Three events of moderate strength were taken to be further analyzed by mesoscale meteorological model simulations with subsequent trajectory studies. In two cases the intrusion <b>of</b> stratospheric <b>air</b> was induced by tropopause foldings. In the third case a cut-off low with an associated fold was responsible for the increased exchange.

However, in some notable cases, gloveboxes used for aseptic processing have provided no more sterile product protection than the traditional laminar air flow hood (LAF) design of the 1960s.

40|$|In a Tokamak vacuum vessel, plasma-wall {{interactions}} {{can result}} in production of radioactive dust and H isotopes (including tritium) can be trapped both in in-vessel material and in dust.

Hydrogen isotopes could also be desorbed from in-vessel components, e. g. cryopumps. In events where an <b>ingress</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> to the vacuum vessel occurs, reaction of the air with hydrogen and/or dust therefore cannot be completely excluded.

This response is evident in isentropic potential vorticity maps, TOMS ozone fields and SAM II polar stratospheric clouds. An important feature of the high latitude Southern Hemisphere lower stratosphere is a transition at potential temperatures in the 390 to 400 K range. This transition, the vortopause, is clearly marked in aircraft profiles of O 3, H 2 O, N 2 O and ClO at latitudes 68 to 72 S near the Antarctic peninsula, and also cross-sections of potential vorticity and potential temperature; above it, the isopleths are more closely spaced than below it.

But a new quality of safety, a so called catastrophe-free nuclear technology is necessary for making world-wide increase of nuclear energy possible. Producing energy in a catastrophe-free way means, that the consequences of largest accidents have no major impact an {{the environment of the}} power plant. Even in case of extreme accidents there must be no realise of unallowable amounts of radioactive fission products. A high-temperature reactor is able to reach this objective by construction. For example the power plant can be designed to remove decay heat without using any active system. However, during operation a break in the primary circuit of the HTR is principally possible. This accident is called an air ingress accident into the hot graphite reactor core. The leakage causes a pressure drop in the helium filled system, a lost of inert helium and after some time an air mass flow may be able to stream through the core according to free natural convection. If the <b>ingress</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> is not stopped this accident finally ends with a dangerous damage of the graphite fuel elements and reflector structures according to graphite corrosion with oxygen. The destroyed fuel elements will release fission products. With the large-scale NACOC experiment a testing device is currently in operation at the Institute of Safety Research and Reactor Technology in the Research Centre Jülich. This set-up allows to investigate the sequence of events and consequences of air ingress accidents. This report treats following points which finally lead {{to a better understanding of}} the air ingress accident.

40|$|This project {{led to an}} {{improved}} understanding of the mechanisms of dross formation. The microstructural evolution in industrial dross samples was determined. Results suggested that dross that forms in layers with structure and composition determined by the local magnesium concentration alone. This finding is supported by fundamental studies of molten metal surfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data revealed that only magnesium segregates to the molten aluminum alloy surface and reacts to form a growing oxide layer. X-ray diffraction techniques that were using to investigate an oxidizing molten aluminum alloy surface confirmed {{for the first time}} that magnesium oxide is the initial crystalline phase that forms during metal oxidation. The analytical techniques developed in this project are now available to investigate other molten metal surfaces. Based on the improved understanding of dross initiation, formation and growth, technology was developed to minimize melt loss. The concept is based on covering the molten metal surface with a reusable physical barrier. Tests in a laboratory-scale reverberatory furnace confirmed the results of bench-scale tests. The main highlights of the work done include: A clear understanding of the kinetics of dross formation and the effect of different alloying elements on dross formation was obtained. It was determined that the dross evolves in similar ways regardless of the aluminum alloy being melted and the results showed that amorphous aluminum nitride forms first, followed by amorphous magnesium oxide and crystalline magnesium oxide in all alloys that contain magnesium. Evaluation of the molten aluminum alloy surface during melting and holding indicated that magnesium oxide is the first crystalline phase to form during oxidation of a clean aluminum alloy surface. Based on dross evaluation and melt tests it became clear that the major contributing factor to aluminum alloy dross was in the alloys with Mg content. Mg was identified as the primary factor that accelerates dross formation specifically in the transition from two phases to three phase growth. Limiting magnesium oxidation on the surface of molten aluminum therefore becomes the key to minimizing melt loss, and technology was developed to prevent magnesium oxidation on the aluminum surface. This resulted in a lot of the work being focused on the control of Mg oxidation. Two potential molten metal covering agents that could inhibit dross formation during melting and holding consisting of boric acid and boron nitride were identified. The latter was discounted by industry as it resulted in Boron pick up by the melt beyond that allowed by specifications during plant trials. The understanding of the kinetics of dross formation by the industry partners helped them understand how temperature, alloy chemistry and furnace atmosphere (burner controls [...] e. g. excess air) effected dross formation. This enables them to introduce in their plant process changes that reduced unnecessary holding at high temperatures, control burner configurations, reduce door openings to avoid <b>ingress</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> and optimize charge mixes to ensure rapid melting and avoid excess oxidation...|$|E
40|$|Between 2004 {{and early}} 2006 a large-scale, instrumented, {{potentially}} contaminating trial waste rock dump was constructed and monitored at Cadia Hill Mine, in NSW, Australia. The trial waste rock dump was instrumented with lysimeters to measure rainfall infiltration and seepage through its base, and temperature sensors and gas sampling tubes to evaluate oxidation {{of the waste}} rock, together with three instrumented trial store and release covers on the surface. This thesis describes the construction and instrumentation of the trial waste rock dump and the monitoring results obtained to date, and applies unsaturated soil mechanics principles to understanding the early performance and predicting the future performance of the trial waste rock dump and trial store and release covers. For a given rainfall regime, the rate and quantity of rainfall infiltration into a waste rock dump of a given height, the wetting up of the dump over time, and the occurrence of base seepage will largely be dictated by the particle size distribution of the waste rock delivered to the dump, and the stratigraphy of the dump. The particle size distribution of the waste rock delivered to the dump {{will depend on the}} fragmentation of the rock due to blasting and the degree of weathering and hence breakdown on handling of the rock. A waste rock dump constructed by conventional loose end-dumping from haul trucks from a tip-head, as was the case for the trial waste rock dump, consists of a trafficked surface layer extending to a depth of approximately 1 m, underlain by discontinuous alternating coarse and fine-grained layers raveling at the angle of repose of the waste rock, with a base rubble zone of boulders which ravel to the toe of the dump on end-dumping. Trafficking of the surface of the dump by dozers and haul trucks leads to the breaking down, burial and side-casting of the rock to form a well-graded material typically finer than 100 mm in particle size, with a moderate to high water storage capacity. The underlying coarse-grained angle of repose layers serve as air pathways during dry conditions and preferred seepage pathways during and following periods of heavy rainfall resulting in base seepage. The fine-grained angle of repose layers have a moderate to high water storage capacity and largely retain water in storage rather than generating base seepage. The base rubble zone may contain boulders up to 1 m in size, depending on the fragmentation of the rock due to blasting and the degree of weathering and hence breakdown on handling of the rock. It serves largely as a pathway for air during dry conditions, while passing base seepage during and following periods of heavy rainfall. As the dump wets up, partially saturated “fingers” develop and extend into the dump. Partially saturated fine-grained layers, having a medium to high water storage capacity, largely retain their partial saturation, while coarse-grained layers drain resulting, in base seepage. Plugs of water temporarily stored within the dump drain down through the dump, so that the base seepage that emerges is “old” water, not the rainfall infiltration (“new” water) that generated it. The size of the rainfall event required to generate base seepage will decrease as the dump wets up and the partially saturated fingers extend closer {{to the base of the}} dump. The residence time of water within the dump that passes along preferred seepage pathways will be relatively short and will become shorter as the dump wets up, while the residence time of water stored within the fine-grained layers will be very long, and possibly indefinite in a dry climate. The <b>ingress</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> through the base rubble zone, up the coarse-grained angle of repose layers, through the sides of the dump, and to a lesser extent through the trafficked layer, by the processes of convection, advection and diffusion, respectively, results in the exposure of reactive waste rock to oxidation. The fine-grained reactive waste rock, presenting a far greater surface area per unit volume than the coarse-grained waste rock, and typically having a greater proportion of fresh surfaces, is by far the most reactive. The <b>ingress</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> into the fine-grained layers is largely by diffusion from the adjacent coarse-grained layers. The transport of oxidation products from the dump largely occurs during and following periods of heavy rainfall, when preferred pathway flow is mobilised and base seepage occurs. The main exposure to preferred pathway flow is along these pathways, where the surface area per unit volume and hence the proportion of oxidation products are low, with much of the oxidation products formed on the fine-grained particles retained within the dump along with stored water. Due to the discontinuous stratigraphy of a waste rock dump, the preferential pathways for flow are randomly located within the dump. In addition, preferential pathways evolve over time as the waste rock weathers, settles, and as fines are transported with the flow. The trafficked surface of the dump also evolves over time, becoming more heterogeneous as the surface settles differentially, generating internal rainfall runoff and the transport of fines, and the development of “sinkholes” for the preferred entry of ponded rainfall. The principle purpose of cover systems over waste rock dumps is to restrict net percolation into the dump, so that percolation through the reactive waste rock is minimal in the longer term. The approach used to design any cover system is dominated by climate. Semi-arid environments are conducive to store and release cover systems which take advantage of well-graded oxide materials to provide high storage capacities, low percolation and stability. Three trial store and release covers, each comprising a sealing layer overlain by a thick mounded rocky soil mulch layer, were installed at Cadia Hill Mine in 2005 - 2006 to assess their feasibility to limit net percolation under the climatic conditions encountered at Cadia. This research described in this thesis has demonstrated a number of key issues that should be considered in the management and closure of waste rock dumps: • the initial moisture condition of the end-dumped waste rock will effect its early ability to store incidental rainfall; • the available water storage capacity of the waste rock will affect the size of the triggering rainfall event and the base seepage response time, with the storage capacity being taken up as the dump wets up, reducing both the size of the triggering rainfall event and the response time; • iterative modelling and calculations using HYDRUS- 2 D suggest that the trial waste rock dump will take between 3 years and 6 years to become sufficiently saturated that it will pass any rainfall infiltration, depending on the extent to which the waste rock weathers over time; and • all three trial store and release covers have demonstrated good performance over the monitoring period, and this has been verified using HYDRUS- 2 D,, with any net percolation being the result of an initial high placement moisture content of the cover materials...|$|E

40|$|Eine 'katastrophenfreie Kerntechnik', bei der selbst schwerste Unfaelle auf das Anlageninnere beschraenkt bleiben und somit keine signifikanten Auswirkungen auf die Umgebung des Kraftwerks haben, ist mit Hochtemperatur - Reaktoren realisierbar. Vorangegangene Untersuchungen belegen, dass der Hochtemperatur -Reaktor z. B. der Baureihe 'Modul' bezueglich grundlegender Sicherheitsaspekte ueber inhaerente Sicherheitsmechanismen verfuegt. Als Beispiel sei die Nachwaermeabfuhr ohne aktive Kuehlsysteme genannt. Bezueglich der sicherheitsrelevanten Frage des Lufteinbruchs in den Primaerkreislauf, bei dem Luftsauerstoff mit den heissen Graphitstrukturen des Kerns und der Brennelemente reagieren kann, bestehen jedoch noch offene Fragen zum exakten Reaktionsverlauf, zu den Mechanismen des chemischen Angriffs und den radiologischen Auswirkungen. Die vorliegende Arbeit liefert naehere Informationen ueber den Verlust des inhibierend wirkenden Kuehlmittels Helium, ueber das Einsetzen einer Durchstroemung aufgrund von Naturkonvektion und ueber den zu erwartenden Massenstromverlauf. Der Einfluss des Heliums auf die Stroemungsausbildung und die Hoehe des Massenstroms unter diesen Bedingungen wird ebenfalls dargestellt. Experimente mit graphitischen Einbauten werden durchgefuehrt, die erste Aussagen ueber das Verhalten der Kombination Bodenreflektor und Kugelschuettung in Bezug auf Graphitkorrosion und deren Mechanismen erlauben. Eine Uebersicht ueber inhaerent wirkende Praeventionsmassnahmen und Massnahmen im Rahmen des 'Accident Managements' stellt den Stand der Technik dar. In einer Wertung zeigt sich die Ausfuehrung des Reaktordruckbehaelters durch einen 'vorgespannten Druckbehaelter' als effektivste Massnahme, den Lufteinbruch zu verhindern, bzw. auf ein unrelevantes Mass zu verringern. Abschliessend werden die Hauptgesichtspunkte zum Ausbau des Pruefstands fuer weiterfuehrende experimentelle Arbeiten genannt. Die dargestellten Ergebnisse wurden experimentell in der Versuchsanlage NACOK des Instituts fuer Sicherheitsforschung und Reaktortechnik ermittelt. Die erstellte umfangreiche Datenbasis diente zur Validierung des Thermohydraulik - Simulationsprogramms DIREKT, mit dessen Hilfe nachfolgend die Ergebnisse auf den realen Referenzreaktor uebertragen wurden. (orig.) The future {{world economy}} {{will require a}} {{substantial}} contribution of energy delivered by nuclear power plants to reduce the CO_ 2 -output. But a new quality of safety, a so called catastrophe-free nuclear technology is necessary for making world-wide increase of nuclear energy possible. Producing energy is a catastrophe-free way means, that the consequences of largest accidents have no major {{impact on the environment}} of the power plant. Even in case of extreme accidents there must be no realise of unallowable amounts of radioactive fission products. A high-temperature reactor is able to reach this objective by construction. For example the power plant can be designed to remove decay heat without using any active system. However, during operation a break in the primary circuit of the HTR is principally possible. This accident is called an air ingress accident into the hot graphite reactor core. The leakage causes a pressure drop in the helium filled system, a lost of inert helium and after some time an air mass flow may be able to stream through the core according to free natural convection. If the <b>ingress</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> is not stopped this accident finally ends with a dangerous damage of the graphite fuel elements and reflector structures according to graphite corrosion with oxygen. The destroyed fuel elements will release fission products. With the large-scale NACOC experiment a testing device is currently in operation at the Institute of Safety Research and Reactor Technology in the Research Centre Juelich. This set-up allows to investigate the sequence of events and consequences of air ingress accidents. This report treats following points which finally lead {{to a better understanding of}} the air ingress accident. First: the effect of helium at rest in the upper part of the pressure vessel after pressure drop is demonstrated. Second: the onset of air flow transfer according to free natural convection is shown and the conditions of natural convection flow in a vertical tube system is described. Third: the amount of air mass flow is fixed by an experimental program. Forth: the effect on the mass flow according to different amounts of helium is investigated. Fifth: the DIREKT code was validated by using the experimental results. Sixth: DIREKT calculations deliver results for the HTR - Modul reactor. Seventh: experiments with graphite pebbles and bottom reflectors were done to get an idea about the mechanism acting in the upper part of the bottom reflector and in the lowest pebble layers. Finally possible concepts are described for counteracting the damage and safeguarding the chemical and mechanical stability to the reactor. (orig.)

40|$|In a {{preliminary}} study, paired {{indoor and outdoor}} air sampling was conducted at three locations around the city of Lancaster, UK to examine the influence of combustion sources on air quality by measuring particulate concentrations, particulate magnetic properties and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). With one exception (an indoor suburban air sample), outdoor air samples had higher total suspended particulates (TSP), particle-bound PAH concentrations and magnetic remanence (IRM) values. IRM values were highest for the week-day, outdoor city centre samples and then declined in the sequence: Sunday, city centre > suburban/residential > Lancaster University campus. These data indicate traffic as the major particle-bound PAH, particulates and magnetic source, particularly as sampling was conducted during July {{in the absence of}} any space heating. The indoor air samples revealed a wide variation in pollutant concentrations, characterised by higher vapour levels of 2 - 3 ring PAHs, variable TSP concentrations and variable but generally low IRMs. The differences in PAH concentrations, TSP and IRMs between outdoor and indoor environments indicate limited <b>ingress</b> <b>of</b> outdoor <b>air</b> pollutants to the indoor environment in this study. Our combined PAH and magnetic data identify specific and distinctive indoor pollution signals for each of our sampled sites, reflecting distinct sources. One site, the suburban house, has anomalously high IRM, TSP and particle-bound PAHs. A possible source for these is a cast iron, wood-burning stove (even though not lit). The city centre indoor site is characterised by high TSP and very low IRMs but high values of the magnetic ratio of anhysteretic remanence:saturation remanence, indicative of ultrafine (submicrometre) magnetic grain sizes. The source for this city centre indoor signature is unidentified but may reflect the occupant smoking and/or lighting candles. The indoor campus sample was affected by loss 2 on-ignition procedures carried out in a teaching laboratory. The combined PAH and magnetic analyses thus provide a sensitive and discriminatory means of identifying outdoor, trafficderived pollution, and of discriminating between different types of indoor pollution...|$|R
40|$|Improvements {{in public}} health through better {{sanitary}} plumbing systems has been mainly due to the prevention afforded by barrier technologies to the <b>ingress</b> <b>of</b> foul <b>air,</b> which can contain toxic gases and pathogens, notwithstanding the nuisance of malodour. The main defence against this ingress is the ‘trap seal’ which comes in two forms; the ‘water trap seal’ and the ‘waterless trap seal’. Whilst these devices form effective barriers, they are vulnerable to, or can produce, transient air pressure fluctuations in the system {{which can lead to}} seal loss. Greater understanding of the characteristics of these devices is essential for the development of better protection strategies. The development of novel analytical techniques is central to this research as it increases computer model resolution at these important system extremities. Current methods employ a laboratory only approach, whereby a single loss co-efficient is developed. These laboratory derived boundary conditions are inherently static {{and in the case of}} the waterless trap seal, ignore structure flexibility. This research has produced new methodologies to evaluate performance and generate dynamic boundary conditions suitable for inclusion in an existing 1 -D Method of Characteristics based model, AIRNET, which solves for pressure and velocity via the St. Venant equations of continuity and momentum in a finite difference scheme. The first novel technique developed uses photographic image and pressure data, transformed via photogrammetric and Fourier analysis to produce mathematical representations of the opening and closing of a waterless trap under transient pressures. The second novel technique developed focusses on the dynamic response of a water trap seal. Current boundary conditions use a steady state friction factor, ignoring separation losses. Analysis via ANSYS CFX allowed a frequency dependent dynamic representation of velocity change in the water trap seal to be developed, integrating unsteady friction and separation losses for the first time. Incorporation of these new boundary conditions in AIRNET confirms that frequency dependent whole system responses are possible and more realistic, reflecting both laboratory and on-site observations...|$|R
