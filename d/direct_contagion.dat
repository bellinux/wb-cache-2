40|$|We {{present a}} {{tractable}} framework {{to assess the}} systemic implications of bail-in. To this end, we construct a multi-layered network model where each layer represents the securities cross holdings of a specific seniority among the largest euro area banking groups. On this basis, the bail-in of a bank can be simulated to identify the <b>direct</b> <b>contagion</b> risk to the other banks in the network. We find {{that there is no}} <b>direct</b> <b>contagion</b> to creditor banks. Spill-overs also tend to be small due to low levels of securities cross-holdings in the interbank network. We also quantify the impact of a bail-in on the different liability holders. In the baseline scenario, shareholders and subordinated creditors are always affected by the bail-in, senior unsecured creditors in 75 % of the cases. Finally, we compute the effect of the bail-in on the network topology in each layer. We find that a bail-in significantly reshapes interbank linkages within specific seniority layers...|$|E

Based on this analysis, {{the current study}} constructs a complex network model of P 2 P lending risk contagion in China and performs dynamics analogue simulations in order to analyze general characteristics of <b>direct</b> risk <b>contagion</b> among China’s online P 2 P lending platforms. The assumed conditions are that other financial organizations act as the contagion medium, with variations in the risk contagion characteristics set under the condition of significant information asymmetry in Internet lending. It is indicated that, compared to <b>direct</b> risk <b>contagion</b> among platforms, both financial organizations acting as the contagion medium and information asymmetry magnify the effect of risk contagion.

(ii) The loss distribution for each point in time can be condensed into one indicator, the expected number of failures, without much loss of information.

40|$|We {{model the}} {{allocation}} of central bank liquidity among the participants of the interbank market by using network analysis’ metrics. Our analytical framework considers that a super-spreader simultaneously excels at receiving (borrowing) and distributing (lending) central bank’s liquidity for the whole network, as measured by financial institutions’ hub centrality and authority centrality, respectively. Evidence suggests that the Colombian interbank funds market exhibits an inhomogeneous and hierarchical network structure, akin to a core-periphery organization, in which a few financial institutions fulfill the role of central bank’s liquidity super-spreaders. Our results concur with evidence from other interbank markets and other financial networks regarding the flaws of traditional <b>direct</b> financial <b>contagion</b> models based on homogeneous and non-hierarchical networks. Also, concurrent with literature on lending relationships in interbank markets, we confirm that the probability of being a super-spreader is mainly determined by financial institutions’ size.

40|$|In {{classical}} contagion models, default {{systems are}} Markovian conditionally on {{the observation of}} their stochastic environment, with interacting intensities. This necessitates that the environment evolves autonomously and is not influenced by {{the history of the}} default events. We extend the classical literature and allow a default system to have a contagious impact on its environment. In our framework, contagion can either be contained within the default system (i. e., <b>direct</b> <b>contagion</b> from a counterparty to another) or spill from the default system over its environment (indirect contagion). This type of model is of interest whenever one wants to capture within a model possible impacts of the defaults of a class of debtors on the more global economy and vice versa...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that the Colombian interbank funds market exhibits an inhomogeneous and hierarchical network structure, akin to a core-periphery organization, in which a few financial institutions fulfill the role of super-spreaders because of their simultaneous importance as global borrowers and lenders of central bank money.

Our research contributes by (i) examining and characterizing the actual connective structure of interbank funds networks; (ii) identifying those financial institutions that may be considered the most important conduits for monetary policy transmission, and the main drivers of contagion risk within the interbank funds market; and (iii) confirming that institution-centric (e. g. size) and network-related (e. g. betweenness, concentration of borrowing sources) characteristics may be salient features of super-spreaders.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} impact of the Basel III {{regulatory}} framework on interbank contagion. It focuses on the <b>direct</b> interbank <b>contagion</b> that spreads via interbank foreign claims among national banking sectors. A balance sheet-based network model employs the quarterly consolidated banking statistics, collected by the Bank for International Settlements, to simulate the consequences of credit and funding shock under stressed market conditions. Compared to the Basel II, the Basel III regulatory framework reduces the probability of interbank contagion (following a simulated default of one banking sector) from 31 % to 14 % and lowers {{the impact of}} contagion by 63 % in terms of average loss for a banking sector. The simulations under both regulatory frameworks show that relatively smaller banking sectors can trigger severe interbank contagion comparable to large banking sectors. Throughout the 2005 - 2009 period, the Basel III regulatory framework stabilizes the fluctuations of the scope of interbank contagion...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores various {{channels for}} default clustering. The probability of extreme default losses in U. S. corporate portfolio {{is much greater}} than that estimated from model containing only observed macroeconomic variables. The additional sources of default clustering are provided by <b>direct</b> <b>contagion</b> and latent frailty factor. We build a top-down proportional hazard rate model with self-exciting specification. We develop efficient methods of moment for parameter estimation and goodness-of-fit tests for the default counting process. Our estimates are based on U. S. public firms between 1970 and 2008. We find strong evidence that contagion and frailty are equally important in capturing large portfolio losses. Our empirical findings can be used by banks and credit portfolio managers for economic capital calculations and dynamic risk management...|$|E
40|$|This paper makes a {{conceptual}} {{contribution to the}} e ffect of monetary policy on financial stability. We develop a microfounded network model with endogenous network formation to analyze the impact of central banks' monetary policy interventions on systemic risk. Banks choose their portfolio, including their borrowing and lending decisions on the interbank market, to maximize profit subject to regulatory constraints in an asset-liability framework. Systemic risk arises {{in the form of}} multiple bank defaults driven by common shock exposure on asset markets, <b>direct</b> <b>contagion</b> via the interbank market, and firesale spirals. The central bank injects or withdraws liquidity on the interbank markets to achieve its desired interest rate target. A tension arises between the bene ficial effects of stabilized interest rates and increased loan volume and the detrimental effects of higher risk taking incentives. We fi nd that central bank supply of liquidity quite generally increases systemic risk...|$|E
40|$|This paper puts {{forward a}} novel {{approach}} {{to the analysis of}} <b>direct</b> <b>contagion</b> in financial networks. Financial systems are here represented as flow networks -i. e., directed and weighted graphs endowed with source nodes and sink nodes - and the propagation of losses and defaults, originated by an exogenous shock, is here represented as a flow that crosses such a network. In establishing existence and uniqueness of such a flow function, we address a know problem of indeterminacy that arise, in financial networks, from the intercyclicity of payments. Sufficient and necessary conditions for uniqueness are pinned down. We embed this result in an algorithm that, while computing the propagation caused by a shock, controls for the emergence of possible indeterminacies. We then apply some properties of network flows to investigate the relation between the structures of a financial network-i. e. the size and the pattern of obligations - and its exposure to default contagion...|$|E
40|$|We model {{aggregate}} credit {{losses on}} large portfolios of financial positions contracted with firms subject to both cyclical default correlation and <b>direct</b> default <b>contagion</b> processes. Cyclical correlation {{is due to}} the dependence of firms on common (macro-) economic factors; credit contagion phenomena are associated with the local interaction of firms with their business partners. We provide an explicit normal approximation of the distribution of total portfolio losses, which {{is the key to the}} measurement and management of aggregated credit loss risk. Based on this result we quantify the relation between the variability of global economic fundamentals, strength of local interaction between firms, and the fluctuation of portfolio losses. In particular, we find that cyclical oscillations in fundamentals dominate average portfolio losses, while local firm interaction and the associated contagion processes cause additional fluctuations of losses around their average. The strength of the contagion-induced loss variability and hence the degree of extreme loss risk depends on the complexity of the business partner network, a relation that was recently confirmed by empirical studies...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare {{the effects of}} two {{accounting}} rules, the mark-to-market and the historical cost regimes, on the dynamics of <b>direct,</b> balance sheet <b>contagion</b> in financial networks. This is done using a flow-network representation of a financial system and of the propagation of losses that crosses it {{as a consequence of}} a negative shock. We show that, for any network and any shock, the flow of losses generated with the mark-to-market rule is larger than the one generated by accounting at historical cost. This implies that a financial network is more exposed to default contagion, both in terms of scope and threshold of contagion, under the marking-to-market accounting regime, than with the historical cost regime. </p...|$|R

40|$|Why {{are some}} discases more virulent than others? Vector-borne {{diseases}} such as malaria and water-borne {{diseases such as}} cholera are generally more virulent than diseases spread by <b>direct</b> <b>contagion.</b> One factor that characterizes both vector- and water-borne diseases is their ability to spread over long distances, thus causing infection of susceptible individuals distant from the infected individual. Here we show that this ability of the pathogen to infect distant individuals in a spatially structured host population leads {{to the evolution of}} a more virulent pathogen. We use a lattice model in which reproduction is local but infection can vary between completely local to completely global. With completely global infection the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is the same as in mean-field models while a lower virulence is predicted as infection becomes more local. There is characteristically a period of relatively moderate increase in virulence followed by a more rapid rise with increasing proportions of global infection as we move beyond a 'critical connectivity'. In the light of recent work emphasizing the existence of 'small world' networks in human populations, our results suggests that if the world is getting 'smaller' [...] as populations become more connected [...] diseases may evolve higher virulence...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{approach}} and an empirical procedure to test <b>direct</b> <b>contagion</b> of growth rate in a trade credit network of firms. Our hypotheses are {{that the use of}} trade credit contributes to contagion (from many customers to a single supplier - "many to one" contagion) and amplification (through their interaction with the macrocopic variables, such as interest rate) of growth rate. In this paper we test the contagion hypothesis, measuring empirically the mesoscopic "many-to-one" effect. The effect of amplification has been dealt with in another paper. Our empirical analysis is based on the delayed payments between trading partners across many different industrial sectors, intermediated by a large Italian bank during the year 2007. The data is used to create a weighted and directed trade credit network. Assuming that the linkages are static, we look at the dynamics of the nodes/firms. On the ratio of the 2007 trade credit in Sales and Purchases items on the profit and loss statements, we estimate the trade credit in 2006 and 2008. Applying the "many to one" approach we compare such predicted growth of trade (demand) aggregated per supplier, and compare it with the real growth of Sales of the supplier. We analyze the correlation of these two growth rates over two yearly periods, 2007 / 2006 and 2008 / 2007, and in this way we test our contagion hypotheses. We could not find strong correlations between the predicted and the actual growth rates. We provide an evidence of contagion only in restricted sub-groups of our network, and not in the whole network. We do find a strong macroscopic effect of the crisis, indicated by a coincident negative drift in the growth of sales of nearly all the firms in our sample. Comment: 20 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we analyse {{a market}} where the risky assets follow defaultable {{exponential}} additive processes, with coefficients {{depending on the}} default state of the assets. In this market we show that when an investor wants to maximize a utility function which is logarithmic on both his/her consumption and terminal wealth, his/her optimal portfolio strategy consists in keeping proportions of wealth in the risky assets which only depend on time and on the default state of the risky assets, but not on their price or on current wealth level; this generalizes analogous results of Pasin and Vargiolu (Econ Notes 39 : 65 – 90, 2010) in non-defaultable markets without intermediate consumption. We then present several examples of market where one, two or several assets can default, {{with the possibility of}} both <b>direct</b> and information-induced <b>contagion,</b> obtaining explicit optimal investment strategies in several cases.

60|$|But when I am {{speaking}} of the plague as a distemper arising from natural causes, we must consider it as it was really propagated by natural means.

40|$|This thesis studies {{systemic}} risk through <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>contagion</b> in financial networks. The first and main part {{is devoted to}} modelling the phenomenon of fire sales in a network of financial institutions with common asset holdings, subject to leverage or capital constraints. In contrast to balance sheet <b>contagion</b> based on <b>direct</b> linkages, this price-mediated contagion occurs through common asset holdings, which we quantify through liquidity-weighted overlaps across portfolios. Exposure to price-mediated contagion leads {{to the concept of}} indirect exposure to an asset class, as a consequence of which the risk of a portfolio depends on the network of overlapping portfolios. Our model provides an operational systemic stress testing framework for quantifying the exposure of the financial system to these effects. Using data from the European Banking Authority, we examine the exposure of the EU banking system to price-mediated contagion. Our results indicate that, even with optimistic estimates of market depth, moderately large macro-shocks may trigger fire sales which lead to substantial losses across bank portfolios, modifying the outcome of bank stress tests. Moreover, we show that price-mediated contagion leads to a heterogeneous cross-sectional loss distribution across banks, which cannot be replicated simply by applying a discount factor to portfolios. We propose a bank-level indicator, based on liquidity-weighted overlaps of portfolios which can be used to quantify the contribution of a financial institution to price-mediated contagion. Using a granular supervisory dataset, we show that asset class aggregation has a considerable effect on estimated portfolio-level fire sales losses, an issue ignored in the literature so far. The second part presents an in-depth sensitivity analysis of the Eisenberg & Noe model, a framework commonly used in {{systemic risk}} studies. We develop a Taylor series for the clearing vector and characterise it in terms of estimation errors in the liabilities matrix. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Central Bank {{participants}} at the BIS 2008 Open Economies Meeting in Punta del Este, Uruguay, discussed trends in apital flows since 2003 and their monetary and financial stability implications. Capital flows {{appear to be more}} benign today than in the past, partly because of a greater share of foreign direct investment and reduced reliance on foreign financing that has contributed to improvements in international investment positions (IIPs). Participants held the view that the economies in the region had become more resilient. For instance, although currency and maturity mismatches are still a concern in some countries, they appear to be less relevant today than in the past. The recent shift in the global financial environment and its regional implications were also discussed. Notwithstanding continuing concerns about risks, the impact of the financial turmoil {{at the time of the}} meeting was still limited. Indeed, there was more concern with the risks of a global slowdown than with <b>direct</b> financial <b>contagion.</b> Looking forward, a key issue is how the transition away from the benign global financing environment that characterised the world economy in this decade will unfold. The effects on the region from the global financial turmoil and the associated downturn in economic activity in advanced economies will vary from country to country, and much will depend on specific developments, such as the evolution of commodity prices. In terms of macroeconomic policies in the face of large foreign currency inflows, fiscal and prudential policies to enhance resilience were considered important. It was also believed that sovereign wealth funds could play a useful role. There was less consensus regarding capital controls. Although some argued that they could be effective in the short run, there could be costs in terms of financial market development. Views also diverged on the effectiveness of foreign exchange intervention. Participating central banks agreed that securing financial stability in small open economies required the cooperation of monetary, fiscal and prudential authorities. However, participants expressed concern about possible contagion from the recent financial turmoil operating through foreign-owned banks. In some cases, there was concern that domestic banks with large foreign refinancing needs could also become vulnerable. The document in this volume was written by Alejandro Jara and Camilo E Tovar with the technical advice of Ramon Moreno. We would like to thank all {{participants at}} the meeting for their comments and overall feedback. We are greatly indebted to Pablo Garcia-Luna and Rodrigo Mora for their excellent research assistance. Már Gudmundsson made detailed comments on the document. We hope this publication will be a useful contribution towards improving the understanding of the monetary and financial stability implications of capital flows in the region. ...|$|R
