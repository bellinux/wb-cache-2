5|$|In {{the areas}} in which it was endemic, the emu was an {{important}} source of meat to Aboriginal Australians. They used the <b>fat</b> <b>as</b> bush medicine and rubbed it into their skin. It served as a valuable lubricant, was used to oil wooden tools and utensils such as the coolamon, and was mixed with ochre to make the traditional paint for ceremonial body adornment.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{returning}} {{north in}} spring across the central Mediterranean appear {{to follow a}} well-defined route. Large concentrations of ruffs form every year at particular stopover sites to feed, and individuals marked with rings or dye reappear in subsequent years. The refuelling sites are closer together than the theoretical maximum travel distance calculated from the mean body mass, and provide evidence of a migration strategy using favoured intermediate sites. The ruff stores <b>fat</b> <b>as</b> a fuel, but unlike mammals, uses lipids as {{the main energy source}} for exercise (including migration) and, when necessary, keeps warm by shivering; however, little research has been conducted on the mechanisms by which they oxidise lipids.|$|E
5|$|Like most Old World warblers, {{this small}} species is insectivorous, moving restlessly though foliage or briefly hovering. It has been {{recorded}} as taking insects, mainly flies, from more than 50 families, along with other small and medium-sized invertebrates. It will take the eggs and larvae of butterflies and moths, particularly those of the winter moth. The chiffchaff has been estimated to require about one-third of its weight in insects daily, and it feeds almost continuously in the autumn to put on extra <b>fat</b> <b>as</b> fuel for the long migration flight.|$|E

5|$|Poultry {{meat and}} eggs provide nutritionally {{beneficial}} food containing protein of high quality. This {{is accompanied by}} low levels of fat which have a favourable mix of fatty acids. Chicken meat contains about {{two to three times}} as much polyunsaturated <b>fat</b> <b>as</b> most types of red meat when measured by weight. However, for boneless, skinless chicken breast, the amount is much lower. A 100-g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 g of fat and 31 g of protein, compared to 10 g of fat and 27 g of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.|$|E
5|$|There are {{variations}} on the potbelly theme including complete potbelly sculptures, headless potbellies, {{some of which may}} be deliberately headless, and potbelly sculptures that consist of only a bodiless head that are recognised as belonging to the style even though they have no potbelly body. Some potbelly sculptures are wearing collars or clothing while others are apparently naked. There are examples with very prominent navels while other sculptures have no emphasis on the navel at all. Some examples of potbelly sculpture have chest ornaments and some sculptures are seated on pedestals. There are examples of potbelly sculptures corresponding to the general type that are not so <b>fat</b> <b>as</b> is the norm.|$|E
5|$|Lawson {{was next}} signed to BBC Two {{to host a}} three-part cookery show {{entitled}} Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, which began on 6 December 2006 and aired weekly. The first two episodes secured the second highest ratings of the week for BBC Two, with the first episode debuting with a strong 3.5 million. The final episode {{went on to become}} the top show on BBC Two the week that it was aired. Nigella's Christmas Kitchen won Lawson a second World Food Media Award in 2007. Her influence as a food commentator was also demonstrated in late 2006, when after she had lauded goose <b>fat</b> <b>as</b> being an essential ingredient for Christmas, sales percentages of the product increased significantly in the UK. Waitrose and Tesco both stated that goose fat sales had more than doubled, as well as Asda's goose fat sales increasing by 65% from the previous week. Similarly, after she advised using prunes in a recipe on Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, Waitrose had increased sales of 30% year on year.|$|E

40|$|Waste {{oils and}} fats {{can be used as}} {{renewable}} fuel resources. Conversion of waste {{oils and fats}} to biodiesel fuel is one possibility but poses some difficulties such as in the use of toxic or caustic materials and by product disposal. Conversion to biodiesel may also decrease the economic attractiveness of using waste oils as fuels. An alternative to the use of biodiesel is the use of vegetable oils or rendered animal <b>fats</b> <b>as</b> a fuel. Using relatively unmodified oils or fats eliminates the problem associated with toxic and caustic precursor chemicals and residual biodiesel alkalinity as the oil is used without altering its chemical properties. This paper discusses the use of waste vegetable and animal oils and <b>fats</b> <b>as</b> unmodified fuels in compression ignition engines...|$|R
5|$|Stock ducks {{would be}} chosen from ducklings hatched in March, with a typical breeder keeping six males and twenty laying females {{at any given}} time. The females would be kept for around a year before mating, {{typically}} to an older male. They would then generally be replaced, to reduce the problems of inbreeding. Stock ducks were allowed to roam freely during the day, and would swim in local ponds which, although privately owned, were treated as common property among the duck breeders; breeders would label their ducks with markings on the neck or head. The stock ducks would forage for greenery and insects, supplemented by greaves (the residue left after the rendering of animal <b>fat).</b> <b>As</b> ducks lay their eggs at night, the ducks would be brought indoors overnight.|$|E
5|$|The {{aim of the}} ducker was to {{get every}} {{duckling}} as <b>fat</b> <b>as</b> possible {{by the age of}} eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.|$|E

30|$|FXR (PDB ID: 1 OSH) ([URL] {{functions}} as a bile acid (BA) sensor, coordinating cholesterol metabolism, lipid homeostasis and absorption of dietary <b>fats</b> <b>as</b> well as, vitamins.

In addition, activation of FXR lowers plasma triglyceride levels (Downes et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2006 and Bailey et al. 2004). Due to these reasons, FXR becomes an attractive molecular target for indirect control of lipid levels.|$|R
25|$|Dioxins are absorbed {{primarily}} through dietary intake of <b>fat,</b> <b>as</b> {{this is where}} they accumulate in animals and humans. In humans, the highly chlorinated dioxins are stored in fatty tissues and are neither readily metabolized nor excreted.

According to Charles Fergus' Wild Guide: Bears, bear fur is also a source of insulation that allows bears to inhabit almost any habitat, from the hot jungles inhabited by sun bears and sloth bears to the frozen tundra inhabited by polar bears, thus occupying most of the same territory as man.|$|E
25|$|BMI is {{particularly}} inaccurate {{for people who}} are very fit or athletic, as their high muscle mass can classify them in the overweight category by BMI, even though their body fat percentages frequently fall in the 10â€“15% category, which is below that of a more sedentary person of average build who has a normal BMI number. Body composition for athletes is often better calculated using measures of body <b>fat,</b> <b>as</b> determined by such techniques as skinfold measurements or underwater weighing and the limitations of manual measurement have also led to new, alternative methods to measure obesity, such as the body volume index.|$|E
