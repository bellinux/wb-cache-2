40|$|ABSTRACT: Calendering is {{a process}} for {{producing}} plastic sheets of a desired final thickness and appearance. The thickness of the exiting sheet during a calendering operation is uniquely found by the lubrication approximation theory and the application of the Swift boundary conditions, which dictate that both the pressure and its axial derivative are zero at detachment. This cannot be used in a 2 D analysis of the process, where the <b>detachment</b> <b>point</b> is the anchor of a free surface, and hence a singular point where both the pressure and the stresses go through numerical oscillations. This difficulty can be circumvented by using the boundary element method (BEM), which uses as primary variables velocities and tractions, and thus avoids pressures and stresses. Then the <b>detachment</b> <b>point</b> is found as the point where the tangential traction becomes zero. Numerical tests undertaken here with the finite element method (FEM) show that the LAT results {{can be used as a}} good approximation for the <b>detachment</b> <b>point,</b> which is then fixed. Comparisons with 2 D BEM results show a good agreement for all flow field variables. However, the exact position of the <b>detachment</b> <b>point</b> in a 2 D FEM analysis is still elusive, since for viscous polymer melts the contact angle is not known and should be part of the solution. Some thoughts are given about how to tackle this still unresolved issue, based on double nodes with discontinuous velocities and pressures.

During spinning, these solutions are {{pulled out of the}} spinneret at a certain draw ratio. This proces is studied. After surveying the equations governing the spinning process, attention is focused on the position of the <b>detachment</b> <b>point</b> in dependence of the solution properties and the processing conditions. A simple force balance at this point equilibrates the spinning tension (dominated by the elongational viscosity, the draw ratio and the strain rate) and the first normalstress difference-(which depends on shear rate and die geometry). This analysis yields the upstream position of the <b>detachment</b> <b>point.</b> Intriguingly, the same analysis applies to the almost classical rheological problem of the entrance flow in a contraction. Following the same procedure, the size of the vortices can be predicted in dependence of the Deborah number, provided that both the transient elongational viscosity and the first normal strass difference of the solution are known. In fact, the latter problem might be less complicated because the flow occurs under isothermal conditions. However, one has to neglect the two-dimensional character of the flow in order to reach analytical results...|$|E

40|$|Flow instabilities of {{wet-spun}} fibers in {{the form}} of draw resonance can result in radius fluctuations which impose limitations on either fiber quality or production rate. Also, at high winding velocities, if the fluid strength is sufficiently high, a filament can be pulled out of the die. The force balance between the integrated normal stress that occurs during flow in the upstream region and the spinning force determines the position of the <b>detachment</b> <b>point</b> when the filament detaches from the spinneret wall. Filament pull-out complicates the stability analysis {{in the sense that the}} upstream boundary conditions now depend on the position in the spinneret. In addition, the filament length varies in time. In this work we extend the stability analysis on fiber spinning of a single isothermal filament by including the upstream pull-out condition in a one-dimensional fiber spin model using the eXtended Pom-Pom (XPP) constitutive model. Using a spectral method, our analysis incorporates the <b>detachment</b> <b>point</b> which position is allowed to vary according to the prescribed slope of the upstream integrated normal stress. Changing the slope S for a certain DR (draw ratio) and De (Deborah) number, the growth rate for each S value can be determined. We compare the stability regions of our fiber spin model with pull-out, using different S values, to fiber spinning without pull-out. For low De values a finite value of S is destabilizing the flow whereas for higher De values there is a range of S values that stabilizes the flow. For S = 0 we obtain fiber spinning with a constant force at pull-out, but the critical DR is greatly reduced. This is in contrast to fixed length fiber spinning of a Newtonian fluid at a constant force which is known to be stable for any DR...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{separated}} flows {{attracted the}} attention as early as in the Seventies of the previous century.

For blunt bodies an additional condition for smooth separation (called now Brillouin-Villat condition [1, 15]) is to be satisfied. The first approximate solution for a blunt body (the circular cylinder) was provided by Brodetsky [2] who came up with a parabolic expanding at infinity shape of the stagnation zone. To a reasonable degree this solution was qualitatively confirmed by the Navier-Stokes calculations [11, 7, 8].

40|$|Flow instabilities of {{wet-spun}} fibers in {{the form}} of draw resonance can result in radius fluctuations which impose limitations on either fiber quality or production rate. Also, at high winding velocities, if the fluid strength is sufficiently high, a filament can pull out of the capillary. Filament pull-out complicates the stability analysis of fiber spinning {{in the sense that the}} upstream boundary conditions now depend on the position in the spinneret. In addition, the filament length varies in time. Intuitively, one would expect that including filament pull-out will stabilize the spinning process since the change in filament length adjusts the spinning force to result in a process similar to spinning with a constant take-up force, which is always stable. However, from a linear stability analysis on a thin filament fiber spin model including filament pull-out, we obtained the least stable solution in a straight capillary with minimal restriction on the movement of the detachment position, see van der Walt et al. [1]. In this paper we extend the stability analysis to a fully axisymmetric transient isothermal fiber spin model including filament detachment from the capillary wall using the eXtended Pom-Pom (XPP) constitutive model. Using finite elements, we develop a numerically efficient algorithm for the dynamics of the <b>detachment</b> <b>point.</b> A comparison between the stability results of the axisymmetric and the thin filament model shows that the axisymmetric model is more stable than the thin filament pull-out model but less stable than the thin filament fixed length model for the same De (Deborah) number. We are also not able to confirm from the axisymmetric model the assumption of the force being a function of the detachment position in the thin filament model. Revisiting the integral momentum balance at the <b>detachment</b> <b>point</b> derived by Bulters and Meijer [2] we find that their force balance is not valid.
