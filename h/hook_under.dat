In some other insect species (e.g., Mecoptera, Lepidoptera, and some Trichoptera) the jugal lobe of the forewing covers {{a portion of the}} hindwing (jugal coupling), or the margins of the forewing and hindwing overlap broadly (amplexiform coupling), or the hindwing bristles, or frenulum, <b>hook</b> <b>under</b> the retaining structure or retinaculum on the forewing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{point of}} land on the East River now called Corlears Hook was also called Corlaers <b>Hook</b> <b>under</b> Dutch and British rule, and briefly Crown Point during British {{occupation}} in the Revolution. It was named after the schoolmaster Jacobus van Corlaer, who settled on this [...] "plantation" [...] that in 1638 was called by a Europeanized version of its Lenape name, Nechtans or Nechtanc. Corlaer sold the plantation to Wilhelmus Hendrickse Beekman (1623–1707), founder of the Beekman family of New York; his son Gerardus Beekman was christened at the plantation, on August 17, 1653.|$|E

2500|$|The {{projection}} {{into the}} East River that retained Corlaer's name {{was an important}} landmark for navigators for 300 years. On older maps and documents it is usually spelled Corlaers Hook, but since the early 19th century the spelling has been anglicized to Corlears. The rough unplanned settlement that developed at Corlaer's <b>Hook</b> <b>under</b> the British occupation of New York during the Revolution was separated from the densely populated city by rough hills of glacial till: [...] "this region lay beyond the city proper, from which it was separated by high, uncultivated, and rough hills", observers recalled in 1843.|$|E

2500|$|Larger outdoor {{models are}} usually {{radio-controlled}} gliders that are piloted remotely {{from the ground}} with a transmitter. These can remain airborne for extended periods by using the lift produced by slopes and thermals. These can be winched into wind by a line attached to a <b>hook</b> <b>under</b> the fuselage with a ring, so that the line will drop when the model is overhead. Other methods of launching include towing aloft using a model powered aircraft, catapult-launching using an elastic bungee cord and hand-launching.

2500|$|By the 1990s, new {{styles of}} close-trimmed pants legs made it {{possible}} for players to wear pants that ran clear to the shoetops, in lieu of the traditional knee-breeches style that had prevailed for generations. This led to a violation of the literal concept of a [...] "uniform", in that different players on a given team might wear knee-length and full-length pants on the field at the same time. Players such as Manny Ramirez have taken this fashion trend to an extreme, wearing loose-fitting pants whose legs nearly lap under the heels of the shoes. Some, such as Gary Sheffield, have even developed straps that <b>hook</b> <b>under</b> the cleats. Meanwhile, players such as Alfonso Soriano continue to wear the traditional knee-breeches, though most of these players still lack the traditional stirrups.|$|E

60|$|Some of the amusements and pleasures which Antony and Cleopatra pursued were {{innocent}} in themselves, though wholly unworthy {{to be made}} the serious business of life by personages on whom such exalted duties rightfully devolved. They made various excursions upon the Nile, and arranged parties of pleasure {{to go out on}} the water in the harbor, and to various rural retreats in the environs of the city. Once they went out on a fishing-party, in boats, in the port. Antony was unsuccessful; and feeling chagrined that Cleopatra should witness his ill-luck, he made a secret arrangement with some of the fishermen to dive down, where they could do so unobserved, and fasten fishes to his <b>hook</b> <b>under</b> the water. By this plan he caught very large and fine fish very fast. Cleopatra, however, was too wary to be easily deceived by such a stratagem as this. She observed the maneuver, but pretended not to observe it; she expressed, on the other hand, the greatest surprise and delight at Antony's good luck, and the extraordinary skill which it indicated.|$|E
50|$|Other {{groups of}} moth have a {{frenulum}} on the hindwing that <b>hooks</b> <b>under</b> a retinaculum on the forewing. The retinaculum is a hook or tuft {{on the underside}} of the forewing of some moths.

The doctor looks him over very carefully without speaking, and then suddenly fetches him a blow in the stomach that doubles him up speechless. The doctor {{walks over to the}} window and reads the morning paper for a while. Presently he turns and begins to mutter more to himself than the patient. [...] "Hum!" [...] he says, [...] "there's a slight anaesthesia of the tympanum." [...] "Is that so?" [...] says the patient, in an agony of fear. [...] "What can I do about it, doctor?" [...] "Well," [...] says the doctor, [...] "I want you to keep very quiet; you'll have to go to bed and stay there and keep quiet." [...] In reality, of course, the doctor hasn't the least idea what is wrong with the man; but he DOES know that if he will go to bed and keep quiet, awfully quiet, he'll either get quietly well again or else die a quiet death. Meantime, if the doctor calls every morning and thumps and beats him, he can keep the patient submissive and perhaps force him to confess what is wrong with him.|$|E
60|$|We fell in {{with this}} {{land in the}} evening, {{so that it was}} not {{perceived}} till we were within half a league of it, which very much alarmed us, the land being low; and having found our error, we brought to and stood off and on till morning, when we saw the shore lie, as it were, under our larboard bow, within a mile and a quarter distance, the land low, but the sea deep and soft ground. We came to anchor immediately, and sent our shallops to sound the shore, and the men found very good riding in a little bay, under the shelter of two points of land, one of which made a kind of <b>hook,</b> <b>under</b> which we lay secure from all winds that could blow, in seventeen fathoms good ground. Here we had a good observation, and found ourselves in the latitude of 50° 21'. Our next work was to find water, and our boats going on shore, found plenty of good water and some cattle, but told us they could give no account what the cattle were, or what they were like. In searching the coast, we soon found this was an island also, about eleven leagues in length, from north-west to south-east, what breadth we could not tell. Our men also saw some signs of inhabitants. The next day six men appeared at a distance, but would take notice of no signals, and fled as soon as our men advanced. Our people went up to the place were they lay, and found they had made a fire of some dry wood; that they had laid there, as they suppose, all night, though without covering. They found two pieces of old ragged skins of deer, which looked as if worn out by some that had used them for clothing, and one piece of a skin of some other creature, which had been rolled up into a cap for the head; also a couple of arrows of about four feet long, very thick, and made of a hard and heavy wood; so they must have very large and strong bows to shoot such arrows, and consequently must be men of an uncommon strength.|$|E
