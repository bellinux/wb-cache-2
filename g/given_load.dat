25|$|One subtle {{feature of}} rockets relates to energy. A rocket stage, while {{carrying}} a <b>given</b> <b>load,</b> {{is capable of}} giving a particular delta-v. This delta-v means that the speed increases (or decreases) by a particular amount, independent of the initial speed. However, because kinetic energy is a square law on speed, {{this means that the}} faster the rocket is travelling before the burn the more orbital energy it gains or loses.|$|E

2500|$|The {{non-inverting}} input of the operational amplifier needs {{a path for}} DC to ground; if the signal source does not supply a DC path, or if that source requires a <b>given</b> <b>load</b> impedance, then the circuit will require another resistor from the {{non-inverting input}} to ground. When the operational amplifier's input bias currents are significant, then the DC source resistances driving the inputs should be balanced. [...] The ideal value for the feedback resistors (to give minimal offset voltage) will be such that the two resistances in parallel roughly equal the resistance to ground at the non-inverting input pin. [...] That ideal value assumes the bias currents are well matched, {{which may not be}} true for all op-amps.|$|E

2500|$|Nanotechnology. Actin-myosin systems act as {{molecular}} motors {{that permit}} {{the transport of}} vesicles and organelles throughout the cytoplasm. It is possible that actin {{could be applied to}} nanotechnology as its dynamic ability has been harnessed in a number of experiments including those carried out in acellular systems. [...] The underlying idea is to use the microfilaments as tracks to guide molecular motors that can transport a <b>given</b> <b>load.</b> That is actin could be used to define a circuit along which a load can be transported in a more or less controlled and directed manner. In terms of general applications, it could be used for the directed transport of molecules for deposit in determined locations, which would permit the controlled assembly of nanostructures. [...] These attributes could be applied to laboratory processes such as on lab-on-a-chip, in nanocomponent mechanics and in nanotransformers that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.|$|E
2500|$|For a <b>given</b> <b>load,</b> sizing of a {{smoothing}} capacitor is a tradeoff between reducing ripple voltage and increasing ripple current. The peak current is {{set by the}} rate of rise of the supply voltage on the rising edge of the incoming sine-wave, reduced by {{the resistance of the}} transformer windings. [...] High ripple currents increase I2R losses (in the form of heat) in the capacitor, rectifier and transformer windings, and may exceed the ampacity of the components or VA rating of the transformer. [...] Vacuum tube rectifiers specify the maximum capacitance of the input capacitor, and SS diode rectifiers also have current limitations. [...] Capacitors for this application need low ESR, or ripple current may overheat them. [...] To limit ripple voltage to a specified value the required capacitor size is proportional to the load current and inversely proportional to the supply frequency and the number of output peaks of the rectifier per input cycle. Full-wave rectified output requires a smaller capacitor because it is double the frequency of half-wave rectified output. [...] To reduce ripple to a satisfactory limit with just a single capacitor would often require a capacitor that's infeasibly large.|$|E

40|$|The {{choice of}} the best {{material}} (meaning the least mass of material carries the <b>given</b> <b>loads</b> safely) is different for axially loaded tension and compression members. Using two materials in trusses, one for tension members {{and the other for}} compression members, is not a good solution because of manufacturing restrictions, potential for galvanic corrosion, and other incompatibility problems.
