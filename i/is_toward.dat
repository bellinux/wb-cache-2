25|$|Recent {{advances}} in vehicle electronics {{have led to}} a move towards fewer, more capable computer processors on a vehicle.

Perhaps {{the most important of these}} for Intelligent Transportation Systems is artificial intelligence.|$|E
25|$|The tallit gadol is {{typically}} either all white, white with black stripes, white with blue stripes, or white with twelve-colored stripes. The all-white and black-and-white varieties {{have traditionally been}} the most common, with the blue-and-white variety, in the past {{said to be in}} remembrance of the blue thread or tekhelet, becoming increasingly prevalent in recent years among non-Orthodox Jews on account of the association of blue and white with the State of Israel. The all-white variety is customary among Sepharadic communities, whereas among Ashkenazic communities the tendency <b>is</b> <b>toward</b> white tallitot with black stripes. One explanation for the significance of the black stripes is that their black color symbolizes the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and the exile of the Jews from the land of Israel.|$|E

25|$|Jian'an poetry {{refers to}} those poetic {{movements}} occurring {{during the final}} years of the failing Han Dynasty and continuing their development into the beginning of the Six Dynasties period. Jian'an is considered as a separate period because this is one case where the poetic developments fail to correspond with the neat categories aligned to chronology by dynasty. Typical poets of this period are Cao Cao, Cao Pi, Cao Zhi, and Xu Gan. One of the more important poetic developments of this period <b>is</b> <b>toward</b> the odd number, fixed length verse styles also typical of the Tang poetry period. As a result, some of the poetic forms often associated with Tang poetry can be traced back developmentally to some of the forms developed during the Jian'an period.|$|E
25|$|Previously, {{physical}} dependence on benzodiazepines was largely thought to occur only in people on high-therapeutic-dose ranges. Low- or normal-dose dependence was not suspected until the 1970s, {{and it was}} not until the early 1980s that it was confirmed. Low-dose dependence has now been clearly demonstrated in both animal studies and human studies, and is a recognized clinical disadvantage of benzodiazepines. Severe withdrawal syndromes can occur from these low doses of benzodiazepines even after gradual dose reduction. An estimated 30–45% of chronic low-dose benzodiazepine users are dependent and it has been recommended that benzodiazepines even at low dosage be prescribed for a maximum of 7–14 days to avoid dependence. As a result, the global trend <b>is</b> <b>toward</b> strict regulations for the prescription of benzodiazepines due to this risk of low-dose dependence.|$|E
25|$|The topmost {{portion of}} the {{memorial}} consists of a larger-than-life figure of a woman representing the South. The orientation of the figure and its face <b>is</b> <b>toward</b> the south, in part to honor the Confederacy but also so that the sun may shine {{on the face of}} the figure at all times (which is symbolic of being favored). The figure's head is crowned with an olive wreath, which is both sacred to Minerva (Roman goddess of war and wisdom) and a symbol of peace. The figure's left hand extends a laurel wreath toward the south in acknowledgment of the sacrifices made by the South's men in arms and as a symbol of the past. The figure holds a pruning hook in its right hand, which in turn rests on a plow. This represents peace and reconciliation as well as the hope that the labor of the South will lead to new glory.|$|E

25|$|Although {{credit cards}} reached very high {{adoption}} {{levels in the}} US, Canada and the UK during the latter 20th century, many cultures were more cash-oriented or developed alternative forms of cashless payments, such as Carte bleue or the Eurocard (Germany, France, Switzerland, and others). In these places, adoption of credit cards was initially much slower. Due to strict regulations regarding bank overdrafts, some countries, France in particular, were much quicker to develop and adopt chip-based credit cards which are seen as major anti-fraud credit devices. Debit cards and online banking (using either ATMs or PCs) are used more widely than credit cards in some countries. It took until the 1990s to reach anything like the percentage market penetration levels achieved in the US, Canada, and UK. In some countries, acceptance still remains low {{as the use of}} a credit card system depends on the banking system of each country; while in others, a country sometimes had to develop its own credit card network, e.g. UK's Barclaycard and Australia's Bankcard. Japan remains a very cash-oriented society, with credit card adoption being limited mainly to the largest of merchants; although stored value cards (such as telephone cards) are used as alternative currencies, the trend <b>is</b> <b>toward</b> RFID-based systems inside cards, cellphones, and other objects.|$|E
500|$|The radial {{velocity}} of Vega is the component of this star's motion along the line-of-sight to the Earth. Movement {{away from the}} Earth will cause the light from Vega to shift to a lower frequency (toward the red), or to a higher frequency (toward the blue) if the motion <b>is</b> <b>toward</b> the Earth. Thus the velocity can be measured from the amount of redshift (or blueshift) of the star's spectrum. Precise measurements of this redshift give a value of [...] The minus sign indicates a relative motion toward the Earth.|$|E

Nethermost Pike <b>is</b> <b>toward</b> {{the southern end}} of this ridge, with Helvellyn itself to the north and Dollywaggon Pike to the south. In common with much of the Helvellyn range there is a marked contrast between the western and eastern slopes of Nethermost Pike. In Wainwright's words: [...] "The grassy western slope trodden by the multitudes is of little interest, but the fell should not be judged accordingly: it is made of sterner stuff. From the east, Nethermost Pike is magnificent, hardly less so than Helvellyn." ...|$|E

500|$|The cantata {{opens with}} [...] "" [...] (Abide with us; for it <b>is</b> <b>toward</b> evening), a {{large-scale}} tripartite chorus, {{reminiscent of a}} slow sarabande or of the closing Ruht wohl, ihr heiligen Gebeine of the St John Passion. The instruments, a choir of three oboes and strings, present a theme which Dürr describes as [...] "of speech-like gestures". It is {{picked up by the}} voices, first in homophony. The vocal lines in this movement descend on [...] "" [...] (for evening is nigh) [...] "as if the gloom of night were weighing upon them". While the beginning of the movement has no tempo marking, the middle section is marked Andante and in Alla-breve time, suggesting a faster pace. The voices, accompanied first only by the continuo, perform a fugue on two subjects at the same time: [...] "denn es will Abend werden" [...] (for it <b>is</b> <b>toward</b> evening) and [...] "und der Tag hat sich geneiget" [...] (and the day is far spent). A third motif, long notes on the same pitch, illustrates the [...] "abiding" [...] or staying. The movement is closed by a shortened reprise of the beginning. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann compares the slow-fast-slow structure of the movement to the French overture and notes that it opens a new series of cantatas. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes the similarity to the last chorus Ruht wohl from Bach's St John Passion, describing the cantata's [...] "tender pleadings which become ever more gestural and urgent for enlightenment in a darkening world from which Jesus' presence has been removed." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{the most}} obvious motion of clouds <b>is</b> <b>toward</b> the center, {{tropical}} cyclones also develop an upper-level (high-altitude) outward flow of clouds. These originate from air that has released its moisture and is expelled at high altitude through the [...] "chimney" [...] of the storm engine. This outflow produces high, thin cirrus clouds that spiral away from the center. The clouds are thin enough for the sun to be visible through them. These high cirrus clouds {{may be the first}} signs of an approaching tropical cyclone. As air parcels are lifted within {{the eye of the storm}} the vorticity is reduced, causing the outflow from a tropical cyclone to have anticyclonic motion. [...] If two tropical cyclones are in proximity to one another, the outflow from the system downstream (normally to the west) can hinder the development of the system upstream (normally to the east).|$|E
