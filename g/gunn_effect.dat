50|$|The <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect,</b> and its {{relation}} to the Watkins-Ridley-Hilsum effect entered the monograph literature in the early 1970s, e.g. in books on transferred electron devices and, more recently on nonlinear wave methods for charge transport. Several other books that provided the same coverage were published in the intervening years, and can be found by searching library and bookseller catalogues on <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1962, {{while working}} for IBM, he {{discovered}} the <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect</b> based upon his refusal to accept inconsistent experimental results in Gallium arsenide as simply [...] "noise". This led to {{the invention of the}} Gunn diode, a miniature microwave generator. While Gunn recognized the importance of the effect, {{he was not able to}} determine the underlying physical process. In December 1964, Herbert Kroemer claimed that the <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect</b> was based upon the Ridley-Watkins-Hilsum effect. Alan Chynoweth, of Bell Telephone Laboratories, showed in June 1965 that only a transferred-electron mechanism could explain the experimental results.|$|E
40|$|As scientists, {{managers}} {{and policy makers}} interested in sediment, we are concerned with understanding and mitigating how sedimentary systems respond to environmental changes or disturbances. The examples presented in this thematic issue of the Journal of Soils and Sediments help to advance our understanding of such issues and show that the link between disturbance and response may not be straightforward. Indeed, one area of research that requires further attention is how landscapes respond to cumulative <b>effects</b> (<b>Gunn</b> and Noble 2009) because, in reality, most landscapes are affected by multiple stressors (both in time and space) which are unlikely to act in complete isolation from one another...|$|R
40|$|Many {{experimental}} evidences {{indicate the}} presence of a ionizing background radiation flux at large redshifts, whose nature is doubtful. A lot of informations about the characteristics of such a background can be obtained both from the study of the <b>Gunn</b> Peterson <b>effect</b> and from the so-called “proximity effect”. In some previous works I suggested the possibility that this ionizing flux comes from the quantum evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs) : here, I discuss the constraints that the experimental measurements put upon the free parameters of this reionization model and I try to verify its reliability. In particular, the radiation intensity of the background at the hydrogen Lyman edge, as inferred from the proximity effect, enables me to determine an upper limit to the PBHs average relics mass; due to our poor knowledge of the ultimate fate of the evaporating black holes, this limit represents an important theoretical information. In the second part of this paper I study the absorption of the ionizing background due to Lyα clouds: in particular, I discuss this phenomenon in presence of different absorption levels and I calculate the HI Gunn Peterson optical depth τGP(z); from a comparison with the experimental data of Giallongo et al. (τGP, HI 1. 7). 1...|$|R
50|$|John Battiscombe Gunn, {{solid state}} physicist. At Malvern {{he worked on}} the physics of {{electronic}} devices. Later, at the IBM Research Laboratories in the U.S., he discovered the <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect</b> used in the Gunn diode.|$|E
50|$|Velocity {{saturation}} is not {{the only}} possible high-field behavior. Another is the <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect,</b> where a sufficiently high electric field can cause intervalley electron transfer, which reduces drift velocity. This is unusual; increasing the electric field almost always increases the drift velocity, or else leaves it unchanged. The result is negative differential resistance.|$|E
5000|$|John Battiscombe [...] "J. B." [...] Gunn (13 May 1928 - 2 December 2008), {{known as}} Ian or Iain, was a British physicist, who {{spent most of}} his career in the United States. He {{discovered}} the <b>Gunn</b> <b>Effect,</b> which led to the invention of the Gunn diode, the first inexpensive source of microwave power that did not require vacuum tubes. He was born John Battiscombe Gunn, but only used that name in legal documents.|$|E
5000|$|The Gunn diode {{is based}} on the <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect,</b> and both are named for the {{physicist}} J. B. Gunn who, at IBM in 1962, discovered the effect because he refused to accept inconsistent experimental results in gallium arsenide as [...] "noise", and tracked down the cause. Alan Chynoweth, of Bell Telephone Laboratories, showed in June 1965 that only a transferred-electron mechanism could explain the experimental results.The interpretation refers to the Ridley-Watkins-Hilsum theory, whereby semiconductors display negative resistance, meaning that increasing the applied voltage causes the current to decrease.|$|E
5000|$|A high-field domain is {{a band of}} {{elevated}} field {{orthogonal to}} the equi-current lines and seen in photoconductive [...] and monochromatic light at the band edge as dark band was discovered by Böer, using the Franz-Keldysh effect. Such domains must appear whenever the conductivity decreases stronger than linearly. This {{can be caused by}} the field dependence of the carrier density, as observed in copper-doped [...] caused by Frenkel Poole excitation of holes, causing faster electron recombination, known as field quenching. These high-field domains, now referred to as Böer domains, or by field dependence of the mobility, caused by excitation of electrons into higher conduction bands with lower mobility as observed in , called the <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect.</b> The high-field domains can be identified by periodical field oscillations between high (the domain) and low values, as shown in Fig. 1.|$|E
50|$|Nag's work {{focused on}} {{semiconductors}} {{and it helped}} in widening {{our understanding of the}} electrical transport phenomena in those high electrical resistant solids. During his early years at Calcutta University, he led a group of students who were engaged in the studies on microwave measurements of semiconductor properties and did advanced research on <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect</b> and microwave radiation. He demonstrated the temperature independence of Two-dimensional electron gas and its alloy scattering limited mobility which was a first time discovery. His studies revealed the non-parabolic nature of electron energy dispersion in narrow quantum wells and this modified the theory of interface roughness scattering limited mobility for Quantum Wells with finite barrier height and Well width. Liquid phase Epitaxy Semiconducting III-V compounds, acousto-electric effect and free carrier absorption, Gini ratio and Si coefficent related to hot-electron galvanomagnetic transport were some of the other areas of his research. He contributed to the development of electron transport theory related to semiconductors and developed a Monte Carlo method for the computation of coefficients related to velocity correlation, diffusion and noise parameters. His body of work is reported to have relevance to the fields of microwave communications and radar, especially in the development of microwave semiconductor devices. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and the article repository of the Indian Academy of Sciences has listed 190 of them. He authored three monographs, Theory of electrical transport in semiconductors, Physics of Quantum Well Devices and Electron Transport in Compound Semiconductors of which the last mentioned is reported to be a significant reference text for researchers. He also contributed chapters to books published by others and his work has drawn citations in a number of books.|$|E

40|$|A general {{asymptotic}} {{analysis of}} the <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect</b> in n-GaAs under general boundary conditions for metal-semiconductor contacts is presented. Depending on the parameter values in the boundary condition of the injecting contact, different types of waves mediate the <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect.</b> The periodic current oscillation typical of the <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect</b> {{may be caused by}} moving charge-monopole accumulation or depletion layers, or by low or high-field charge-dipole solitary waves. A new instability caused by multiple shedding of (low field) dipole waves is found. In all cases the shape of the current oscillation is described in detail: we show the direct relationship between its major features (maxima, minima, plateau's, [...] .) and several critical currents (which depend on the values of the contact parameters). Our results open the possibility of measuring contact parameters from the {{analysis of the}} shape of the current oscillation. Comment: 11 pages, 7 Post-Script figure...|$|E

The generator includes a semiconductor material which exhibits the <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect</b> when current flows between anode and cathode end contacts. The material has a plurality of sides each with a scratch at a different distance from the anode contact. A magnetic field is produced by a magnet placed about the semiconductor field. The Lorentz force produced {{as a function of}} the current flow and the magnetic field drive the electrons to the surface of one of the sides to cause nucleation to occur at the scratch.

40|$|An {{asymptotic}} {{analysis of}} the <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect</b> in two-dimensional samples of bulk n-GaAs with circular contacts is presented. A moving pulse far from contacts is approximated by a moving free boundary separating regions where the electric potential solves a Laplace equation with subsidiary boundary conditions. The dynamical condition for {{the motion of the}} free boundary is a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We obtain the exact solution of the free boundary problem (FBP) in simple one-dimensional and axisymmetric geometries. The solution of the FBP is obtained numerically in the general case and compared with the numerical solution of the full system of equations. The agreement is excellent so that the FBP can be adopted as the basis for an asymptotic study of the multi-dimensional <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect.</b> Comment: 19 pages, 9 figures, Revtex.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{potential}} profile of gateless MESFET devices using electro-optic probing. We have used smooth samples as previous work has shown how rough devices produce excessive noise generated from the Fabry-Perot effect. The profiles measured show non-linear behavior at low fields but high duty cycles. These non-linearities were more noticeable {{at the edges of}} the devices and we believe they are associated with device heating which would be prominent at the edges due to `edge effect'. To remove this effect we have used very low duty cycles and the resulting potential profiles are as expected. Using low duty cycles and applying high electric fields allows us to study non-linear transport behavior in these devices. The samples were designed to exhibit non-linear behavior due to the <b>Gunn</b> <b>Effect.</b> At high applied electric fields the current saturates and becomes noisy, indicative of non-linear behavior. We show the first reported device field profiles under these conditions measured using electro-optic probing. The observed non-linear behavior can be explained in terms of the <b>Gunn</b> <b>Effect...</b>|$|E

40|$|When the {{electric}} field in certain compound semiconductors exceeds a well-defined threshold value, {{the electric}}al current through the material becomes unstable. These instabilities {{may take the}} form of coherent Oscillations at microwave frequencies. The oscillations are not greatly affected by external circuit conditions. The effect was first discovered in gallium arsenide and indium phosphide by J. B. Gunn in 1963, and is now referred to as the "Gunn effect". This paper discusses some of the practical aspects of the <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect</b> in gallium arsenide. A brief theoretical explanation is given, of the intervalley electron energy transfer mechanism which is now generally accepted as the mechanism through which the effect occurs. The preparation of samples is described, {{and the nature of the}} electrical contacts to the material discussed. Ohmic contacts are necessary to prevent junction effects or carrier injection from masking the oscillations. Mounting techniques are described. Circuit considerations are discussed, and the results of various measurements reported. The value of the <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect</b> lies in its potential to directly convert pulse or DC power into microwave power, at frequencies and power levels higher than is possible with other semiconductor devices, and at reasonable efficiencies.

40|$|A {{wealth of}} unique physics makes the {{frequency}} band from 0. 3 ? 3. 0 THz technologically relevant and compact room-temperature semiconductor sources would en- able many new spectroscopic applications. All semiconductor sources currently have serious difficulties reaching the THz, and no THz device {{of any type}} operates on the full range at room temperature. This dissertation proposes a novel semiconductor source which utilizes the transferred-electron (<b>Gunn)</b> <b>effect</b> and the Smith-Purcell effect to operate over {{the majority of the}} 0. 3 ? 3. 0 THz band at room temperature. Mathematical derivations provide a theoretical analysis of the device and computer simulations explore its performance as a function of design. The dissertation begins with a description of the device and an overview of the field of terahertz science. A literature review establishes the relevance and uniqueness of the work and highlights the physical principles required to model the operation of the device. Next, the mathematical ?machinery? required model the device is built, starting with a derivation of the Butcher-Fawcett ?equal-areas? method used to calculate the <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect.</b> A description of the computer code written to implement the equal-areas method and examples validating its correct operation follow. A derivation of the Smith-Purcell effect provides a closed-form solution for the electric field, which is then combined with the <b>Gunn</b> <b>effect</b> results. With the theoretical methods thus established, a detailed explanation of the simulation methods used to model the device is provided, followed by a detailed comparison between theory and simulation ? in which it is shown that the theoretical methods display a high degree of agreement with computer simulations of the device. The results of an extensive design study are then presented that map the range of predicted results for this terahertz device. The Smith-Purcell device is found to perform better than or comparable to any state-of-the-art semiconductor THz source. At room temperature, a single 100 ?m-wide device is predicted to generate 365 ?W of power at 0. 28 THz and 1 ?W at 2. 5 THz. The dissertation concludes with suggestions for subsequent research ? most urgently for an attempt to experimentally verify the predictions of this work...|$|E
