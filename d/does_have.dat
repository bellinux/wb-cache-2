5|$|As {{with all}} long-eared spaniels, Russian Spaniels require checks to prevent ear infections. The breed <b>does</b> <b>have</b> an {{inclination}} {{to gain weight}} easily, which can be prevented by controlling food intake. The Russian Spaniel can be prone to food allergies, which are usually identified at between 1 and 5 months of age with the most common allergens being chicken and carrots. There are no other breed-specific health issues currently known.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{are not an}} {{important}} part of China's agricultural economy, since the majority of China does not have the large open pastures required for sheep-rearing. Sheep farming is more common in the northwestern provinces of the country, where such tracts of land exist. China <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a native sheep breed, the zhan. The population of the breed has been in decline since 1985, despite government promotion of the breed.|$|E

5|$|The Parliament and Council {{have been}} {{compared}} to the two chambers of a bicameral legislature. However, there are some differences from national legislatures; for example, neither the Parliament nor the Council have the power of legislative initiative (except {{for the fact that}} the Council has the power in some intergovernmental matters). In Community matters, this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive). Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a bill before anything can become law. The value of such a power has been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law. Yet it has been argued by former Parliament president Hans-Gert Pöttering that as the Parliament <b>does</b> <b>have</b> the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a de facto right of legislative initiative.|$|E

5|$|The {{south side}} of the {{mountain}} along Suksdorf Ridge is moderately glacier-free, with the only glaciers being the relatively small Gotchen Glacier and the Crescent Glacier. The south side, however, <b>does</b> <b>have</b> some perennial snowfields on its slopes. The Crescent Glacier is the source of Morrison Creek; and, although it does not feed it directly, the Gotchen Glacier is the source of Gotchen Creek. Both creeks drain to the White Salmon River.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, and most of these are members of a European-level political party. However the Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and the nature of coalition governments {{in a number of states}} means that individual configurations would vary on which domestic party was assigned the portfolio. However the broad ideological alignment of each state <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a bearing on the nature of the law the Council produces and the extent to which the link between domestic parties puts pressure on the members in the European Parliament to vote a certain way.|$|E

The Philippine eagle {{is part of the}} Accipitridae family and is endemic to the rainforests of Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{bay bolete}} is {{predominantly}} a mycorrhizal species, it <b>does</b> <b>have</b> some saprophytic tendencies {{and may be}} able to use this lifestyle in certain circumstances. The ectomycorrhizae formed between I.badia and spruce (Picea abies) have active hyphal sheaths and a higher potential to store nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than other mycorrhizal types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic stands and its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of macronutrients. Mycorrhizae with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) have also been described.|$|E

He <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and {{clothing}} allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific-instrument company.

Stewie finds Brian crying in the bathtub, and, seeing how upset Brian is and feeling sorry for him, Stewie successfully fakes his death by putting his collar (which Brian hadn't been wearing) on a stray and killing it in a liquor store fire. The Griffins are devastated upon learning about Brian's supposed death, and realize how close a friend he was to them. Seeing this, Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him, regardless of his species. Brian then realizes his life <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a purpose and thanks Stewie for helping him, and decides to remain hidden to let the Griffins grieve a little longer.|$|E

5|$|Despite Kabuto {{claiming}} that the technique is flawless, it <b>does</b> <b>have</b> several flaws, including that the reanimated can choose to leave their vessels to willingly drift back to the afterlife. Those who are paralyzed, sealed, or subjected to certain genjutsu, such as Komo Amatsukami: Koto, cannot take further action to free themselves until the technique is canceled. Also, the reanimated can sever their link to the jutsu so they will remain among the living even after the jutsu is canceled, as shown by Madara Uchiha. Furthermore, if such a ninja who lost a body part while alive is brought back to true life with the Rinnegan's Samsara of Heavenly Life Jutsu, the living equivalent of that ninja's body part is absent.|$|E
