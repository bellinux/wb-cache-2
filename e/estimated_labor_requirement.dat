40|$|Researchers {{worked with}} farmers in eastern Uganda to develop {{alternatives}} for soil management using crotalaria (Crotalaria ochroleuca), mucuna (Mucuna pruriens var. utilis), lablab (Dolichos lablab), and canavalia (Canavalia ensiformis) as green manures in short-term fallows. The participatory research {{was part of}} a community-based approach for systems improvement. Grain yields of maize (Zea mays) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) following one season of crotalaria fallow were 41 % and 43 %, respectively, more than following a two-season weedy fallow. Grain yields of maize following a one-season fallow with mucuna and lablab were 60 % and 50 % higher, respectively, as compared with maize following maize. Maize and bean yield were more, although effects were small, during the second and third subsequent seasons, indicating probable residual effects of the green manures. Mucuna and lablab were successfully produced by intersowing into maize at three weeks after sowing maize, although the yields of the associated maize crop were reduced by 24 % to 28 %. Farmers <b>estimated</b> the <b>labor</b> <b>requirements</b> for mucuna and lablab to be less than for crotalaria. Farmers independently experimented on how these species can be integrated into banana (Musa spp.), coffee (Coffea robusta), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), and cassava (Manihot esculenta) production systems. Farmers reported that the beneficial effects of the green manures included higher food-crop yields; weed suppression; improved soil fertility, soil moisture, and soil tilth; and erosion control. Mucuna and lablab were preferred because of reduced <b>labor</b> <b>requirements</b> and increased net benefits compared with continuous cropping.

40|$|The issues {{analyzed}} {{in this paper}} are {{the extent to which}} unit costs and production <b>labor</b> <b>requirements</b> might be reduced in manufacturing industries if there is more widespread use of industrial robots and flexible systems. The analysis is reported in detail in Miller (1983). These issues are analyzed from two different perspectives. The technological focus of the first perspective is narrowly confined to the use of robotic manipulators. It is assumed that robotic manipulators will be “retrofitted” into existing production facilities without making major changes in the organization of production within the factory, other than modifying individual work stations so that robots can replace one (or perhaps several) operators. The critical variable in this perspective is an estimate of the percent of the production worker jobs that will be replaced by robots. Reductions in unit cost are calculated by assuming that a given percentage of labor costs is reduced. Cases are also considered where robot use results in a moderate increase in output as well as a decrease in production <b>labor</b> <b>requirements.</b> The question of whether decreases in production <b>labor</b> <b>requirements</b> could be offset by an increase in demand stimulated by a reduction in price is also analyzed...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} to examine the <b>labor</b> <b>requirements</b> {{associated}} with different cropping systems in Ghana in order to guide the prioritization of investments in mechanization in the country. First, major cropping systems are identified in the country by adopting the cropping pattern approach of Ruthenberg (1983), who defined farming systems according to the leading crop activities. Second, <b>labor</b> <b>requirements</b> and costs of production of crops in the various systems are examined at various levels of substitution of either herbicides or animal and mechanical traction for labor. We found that the total <b>labor</b> <b>requirements</b> varied among cropping systems. The requirements were particularly high in the two cocoa cropping systems in the forest zones. The requirements were particularly high for land preparation and crop maintenance. Looking across crops, land preparation and crop maintenance took the largest share of labor for cassava, yam, and maize. Rice, on the other hand, required large shares of labor for land preparation and harvesting. When all the systems are considered together, however, crop maintenance required more labor than land preparation. In response to apparent unavailability and cost of labor, farmers are increasingly demanding mechanical traction for land preparation in Ghana. The benefits of mechanizing land preparation depend on both the system and the type of crop cultivated. Mechanization of land preparation for cassava in the vegetable belt, for instance, is more labor saving and cost effective than m Mechanization of land preparation for cassava in cereals belt. Within systems, there is also variation across crops. Where mechanization is not feasible for land preparation or not yet adopted for other field operations such as weeding, an alternative and common substitution for labor in crop production is herbicides. Herbicides are used to clear land for planting as well as to control weeds in standing crops. We found that where herbicide was used, its application reduced <b>labor</b> <b>requirements</b> for land preparation significantly. Selective herbicides were used to control weeds in all the crops examined and in all the belts except the vegetable belt. They also reduced labor use for weeding drastically.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} different production technologies on relative prices of various goods and through them on the pattern of trade in these goods. Perfect capital mobility and differences in technology across countries are assumed, consistent with the Kemp-Jones model. This allows one to focus on labor costs, rather than on both labor and capital costs. The sector-specific unit labor costs for each country (relative {{to those of other}} sectors within each country) determine the comparative advantage or disadvantage of each country in trade. These sector- and country-specific relative unit labor costs can be broken down into two components, (i) relative wage rates and (ii) relative <b>labor</b> <b>requirements</b> per unit of output. The latter can be further decomposed into two sub-components, (iii) relative capital requirements per unit of labor and (iv) relative rates of technical progress. The decomposition into these two sub-components is carried out by an econometric estimation of the translog production function for each of 10 traded good sectors (2 -digit classification of International Sectoral Data Base, 1970 - 92) in 14 OECD countries, using 3 SLS estimation method. The decomposition of country- and sector-specific unit labor costs results in various empirical findings; two of which are as follows. First, the Ricardian model claims that the relative <b>labor</b> <b>requirements</b> are the key determinant of comparative advantage. The empirical evidence could only confirm this claim for the 1970 s. Second, one of the main sources of the poor performance of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem is widely agreed to be in cross-country differences in relative <b>labor</b> <b>requirements.</b> The decomposition of relative <b>labor</b> <b>requirements</b> into two sub-components indicates that such differences are highly correlated with cross-country differences in relative rates of technical progress in the light industries, but with cross-country differences in relative capital requirements in the heavy industries. ...|$|R
