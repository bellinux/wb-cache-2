50|$|Detroit was by now favouring annual facelifts, and Vauxhall {{reflected}} that trend, announcing further facelifts in 1956 (wind-up windows, larger rear window, wider grille slats, separate amber rear <b>flashing</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> replacing US-style red units {{incorporated into the}} brake/tail light lens, new instrument graphics) and 1957 (electric wipers, larger tail lights, new grille, new 'magic ribbon' AC speedo) {{in line with the}} Wyvern model. Technically, however, there were no further changes until the arrival of a completely new Velox in October 1957.|$|R

5000|$|Subsequently the semaphore-style trafficators on the C-pillars were {{replaced}} with <b>flashing</b> <b>indicators</b> within the <b>light</b> cluster. The front lights were modified {{to conform to}} new standards and in 1957 parallel windscreen wipers were substituted for the original [...] "cross hands" [...] ones featured at launch.|$|R
50|$|The report, dated February 1988, {{also showed}} that halfway through the flight from Pucallpa to Lima, the crew noted a {{possible}} malfunction of the landing gear. A cockpit indicator showed that the gear had not lowered, but CORPAC officials at Lima checked with observers on the ground, who informed the pilot that he could land safely. Villar then ordered Morales to check the emergency gear lowering procedure in the manual; the relevant page was written in English, which First Lieutenant Morales was not fluent in; he mistakenly instructed the pilot to follow step 1.3.1.7, which would <b>flash</b> a red <b>indicator</b> <b>light,</b> rather than step 1.4.3, which would display an orange light.|$|R

40|$|A {{formalism}} {{is motivated}} and described for representing defaults in specifications. The formalism is called Ordered Theory Presentations. The ability to represent defaults narrows the gap between a customer 's initial requirements and a formal specification, and supports reuse on both a small and a large scale. We illustrate the issues throughout {{with reference to the}} lift example. We also consider the application of the formalism to specification revision. 1 Introduction Imagine specifying a lift system. There is a lift, with n buttons and n <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> inside, and there are doors. The buttons inside the lift are for requesting where the lift goes, and the <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> register such requests. There are floors, each with two buttons and <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> (one for requesting to go up and one for down). The <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> switch on in response to button pressings and off when the lift arrives at a floor; and the lift goes from floor to floor depending {{on the state of the}} ligh [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The Škoda 1201 was {{a family}} car {{produced}} by Czechoslovakian automaker AZNP at their plant in Mladá Boleslav. Saloon and estate versions were offered along with a panel van. The car was released in 1954 as a successor to the Škoda 1200. It inherited its predecessor's steel ponton format body. One difference was the fitting of <b>flashing</b> turn signal <b>indicators,</b> whereas the 1200 had incorporated semaphore style trafficators in its front wings: subsequent retro-fitting of <b>flashing</b> <b>indicators</b> to old 1200s has left this as an imperfect method for distinguishing between the two models, however.|$|R
5000|$|The line of {{the front}} {{mudguards}} [...] "which", said The Times, [...] "previously gave the car a somewhat blunt appearance" [...] was re-arranged with the side lamps and <b>flashing</b> <b>indicators</b> in different positions.
