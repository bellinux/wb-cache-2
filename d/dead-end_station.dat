50|$|As in Altenburg, a <b>dead-end</b> <b>station</b> {{was built}} in Hof. At its opening in 1848, it {{connected}} with both the line from Plauen and the line from Bamberg.|$|E
5000|$|Olympic Village — Grushevaya Polyana, 49.9 km, 6 stations; {{according}} to the ongoing construction, the airport Sochi is not connected to this line. The airport Sochi is connected only by a <b>dead-end</b> <b>station</b> to Adler railway station.|$|E
50|$|Located in the {{south-western}} part of Xiamen Island, {{near downtown}} Xiamen, Xiamen Railway <b>Station</b> is a <b>dead-end</b> (terminal) <b>station.</b>|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{a central}} station the Didube station {{in the east and}} the Navtlugi station in the {{northwest}} of Tbilisi become <b>dead-end</b> <b>stations</b> and were just served by passenger trains. Because of this a throughout connection for passenger trains and direct passenger transfers are no more possible in future. Instead of the expected reduction of environmental and traffic problems the axing will cause more traffic problems. Because the public transport and underground transport system of the capital is optimized for the central station. Although argued otherwise by the American consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, the project is therefore very much disputed by Western European transportation specialists and railway companies.|$|R
50|$|The station {{consists}} of two side platforms both heading the same direction. This {{is one of the}} four <b>dead-end</b> terminal <b>stations</b> on the Tokyo subway network that have side platforms (the others being Nishi-Magome on the Asakusa Line, Kita-Ayase on the Chiyoda Line, and Shibuya on the Ginza Line). The platforms are located on the second floor ("2F") level.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{the nuclear weapons}} storage {{facility}} was put up for sale, and now forms the privately-owned Gorse Industrial Estate. The chemical weapon store and former chemical weapon filling station are situated down the <b>dead-end</b> <b>Station</b> Road.|$|E
50|$|The Charleroi-South pre-metro station, simply {{known as}} South (Sud) on network maps, was opened in 1976. Along with Vilette, Sud {{was the first}} station to enter service on the Charleroi pre-metro. Located at street level, Sud was a <b>dead-end</b> <b>station</b> until {{the opening of the}} last section of the central loop of the Charleroi metro, on February 27, 2012.|$|E
50|$|Charleroi-West is a small, {{unstaffed station}} with no {{building}} or other services of its own, served only by Belgian railway line 140 linking Charleroi to Ottignies. Charleroi-West {{used to be}} a <b>dead-end</b> <b>station</b> (and thus the terminus of line 140) until 27 May 1987, when a rail connection to Charleroi-South was opened. The 6 km industrial line 260 links Charleroi-Ouest with the freight classification yard of Monceau-sur-Sambre.|$|E
50|$|The station {{opened on}} 15 January 1903 {{along with the}} line from Woomelang to Hattah. No {{facilities}} were provided. The line from Ouyen to Murrayville opened on 25 June 1912. In 1913 a 53' turntable was provided, the yard at this time consisting of six through roads {{and a number of}} <b>dead-end</b> sidings. A <b>station</b> building and goods shed also existed at this time. Grain silos were provided at the station in the 1930s. From 1948 a railcar passenger service was provided to Pinnaroo, the last run being in November 1968, and the turntable was removed the next year.Services to Mildura continued through to September 1993, at which point the station was closed to passengers.|$|R
50|$|Since the <b>dead-end</b> <b>station</b> on today's Fabrikstraße {{became more}} and more of a problem for rail operations, {{planning}} for a change of route commenced in 1871. Instead of building a connecting line between the two original approach lines, Altenburg received a new station, which was connected to the south by a tunnel. The new station was completed in 1878 after two years of construction.|$|E
50|$|Until February 26, 2012, Parc {{used to be}} a <b>dead-end</b> <b>station</b> (terminus {{of former}} lines 55 and 88), where trams would arrive from Janson on the western side of the central platform, then park in a short tunnel section south of the station, before coming back in the station for {{departure}} on {{the eastern side of the}} platform. The parking tracks are now part of the Parc to Tirou section.|$|E
5000|$|Tsumeb {{railway station}} in Namibia has two triangles. The first and smaller {{one is for}} turning engines and is near the station. The second and larger one is to bypass the <b>dead-end</b> <b>station</b> at Tsumeb for trains {{travelling}} directly between the new extension towards Angola and Windhoek. [...] This direct bypass line can save an hour of shunting time, particularly if the train is longer than the loops in the station.|$|E
5000|$|Caoba-Guanjiashan Railway, or Caoguan Railway (...) {{is a short}} [...] railway in Yunnan Province of China, {{a branch}} of the 1,000 mm (metre-gauge) Kunming-Hekou Railway (the Chinese section of the Kunming-Hai Phong Railway). It is 31.9 km long. It connects Caoba Station on the Kunming-Hekou Railway with Guanjiashan Railway Station, a <b>dead-end</b> <b>station</b> in Datun Town of Gejiu City. It also serves as the {{connector}} between the Kunming-Hekou Railway and the Mengzi-Baoxiu Railway.|$|E
50|$|The transiting freight {{disappeared}} in 1930 when the Ring Line opened. The lines to Vigerslev and Nørrebro closed, (except {{for the first}} few hundred meters of the Vigerslev line, which served as stabling tracks for S-trains until around 1995), and Frederiksberg was now a <b>dead-end</b> <b>station</b> with only the line towards Vanløse left. It was still an important freight station, so the line to Vanløse was doubled and acquired a complex junction with the ring line.|$|E
50|$|The player {{enters the}} city of RHEM on a railway car. The car goes into a <b>dead-end</b> <b>station</b> with a {{rotatable}} track. The player is unable to leave because the track is not yet rotated. While the player {{is on his way}} to the switch to rotate the station track, a previous prisoner of RHEM beats the player to the switch he was after and leaves in the player's railway car. The player must then wander {{the city of}} Rhem in search of a second railway station.|$|E
50|$|The Wuhan-Xianning Intercity Railway (part of {{the future}} Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway system), opened in December 2013, {{provides}} direct rail service from Wuhan's Wuchang Railway Station to Xianning city center. It has two stations in the city's main urban area: Xianning East Railway Station in the downtown Xianning, and Xianning South, the end-of-line (<b>dead-end)</b> <b>station</b> in the industrial area south of downtown. When the system was under construction, the expected travel time from Wuchang to Xianning was stated to be 28 min, but as of 2015, the typical scheduled time from Wuchang to Xianning South (91 km) is more like 70 to 100 min.|$|E
50|$|Station Taganrog Passazhirsky {{was opened}} in 1970. Station {{was built on}} Moskatova Street in the {{northern}} part of Taganrog. It was the second railway station in the city (after Taganrog II). <b>Dead-end</b> <b>station</b> Taganrog II was under pressure, for this reason it was decided to build a new terminus in Taganrog. Passenger and freight trains proceeded in state through the station from Rostov-on-Don to Donbass and Crimea (Donetsk, Horlivka, Lugansk, Sevastopol), as well as Central Ukraine and Moldova. Taganrog Passazhirsky handled several pairs of passenger long-distance trains (Moscow — Adler, Moscow — Kislovodsk, Rostov-on-Don — Simferopol, Yekaterinburg — Simferopol, Rostov-on-Don — Kishinev, Minsk — Adler, Kiev — Adler and others) per day.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first section}} of the Odessa railway length 222,52 miles from Odessa to Birsoy with a branch from Razdelnaya to Cuchurgan and with a branch to the {{quarantine}} Wharf entered into force 3 December 1865. Next 13 years of the Odessa railway existed as an independent mechanism, and then {{became part of the}} joint stock company Southwestern Railways. First Odessa railway station was near the Alexis area. Sergei Witte and Odessa entrepreneurs have shown interest in the organization of freight traffic between major enterprises of the city, also put forward the idea of building branches in important to the city's defense of the military unit. Was built by the Slobodka-Romanovka branch in the port of Odessa, and later in the most important industrial area of the city — Peresyp, which further marked the beginning of kolosovskogo direction. With the growth of passenger traffic, it was decided to build trains, local traffic Razdelnaya railway station, and using existing wrap station only long-distance trains. <b>Dead-end</b> <b>station</b> was built in 1884 in the region of the Italian Boulevard and the adjacent part of which was rebuilt in station square, and was named [...] "Small station", and the existing one was called [...] "the Big station". Also the route was built to service the military units located on the coast between the Middle Fountain and Lustgarten, later demolished in the 1930s.Constructed branch pomichna — podgorodnoe to pair with a vast hive of narrow gauge Railways of Vinnitsa. Then begins the construction of a branch line to service the Balts. Due to the difficult terrain the railroad was constructed a few kilometers South of the city, and around the station Balta rose village belino. Build a direct road connection between the city and the station required a large volume of earthworks, was conducted a few years and for Oceania investment travel on the road for several more years after construction was paid.|$|E
30|$|Political {{decision-making}} {{with respect}} to new technologies is challenged more and more by public ‘resistance’ {{even though there is}} no general technophobia in Europe. 1 Historically rooted in the debate about nuclear power, still present with a focus on potential nuclear waste disposal sites and reactivated by the nuclear accidents in Fukushima, nowadays technologies assumed to be much less controversial get under public pressure as well. Changing an existing railway station into an underground station in Stuttgart, Germany (so-called Stuttgart 21 or S 21), caused an enormous reaction by civil society at that moment when the deconstruction of the existing building of the railway station started. Interestingly, the formal planning process for S 21 was correct in a sense that the usual participatory elements had taken place. There was a planning assessment procedure and it took more then a decade to get through the whole process resulting in the decision to change the railway station from a <b>dead-end</b> <b>station</b> into a pass-through underground station. Obviously, the legitimation resulting from this formal process was not perceived as ‘binding’ for a significant share of citizens in the Stuttgart region. In the case of the S 21 controversy, also an ad hoc mediation process 2 was not able to develop a solution that was considered binding by some of the groups involved. At the end of the day, a citizens’ decision was necessary to, finally, legitimize the originally developed solution of an underground railway station. Noise pollution around airports, as a third example, is also becoming more and more a matter of public opposition. Public interest groups are able to create at least regional political pressure in a way, which cannot simply be ignored by policy making. In short, the increasing complexity of both politics and polity has led to a rising dependence on formal and informal negotiation and deliberation to generate political legitimacy.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{paper is}} aimed {{to analyze the}} {{functioning}} of the existing railway informational system, as the data storage, consideration of the ways to changeover to intelligent management system, including the application of semantic approach. It is necessary to change the paradigm of automated traffic management; this determines changing the paradigm in railway operation management. The development and introduction of new Business-Intelligence-type system requires the formalized knowledge on railway transportation process to be implemented, including in the form of ontology as the model and means to formalize the knowledge. New knowledge requires using the terms and concepts to describe the new processes and management objects in railway operations. Methodology. Formalizing the knowledge one should abstract away from classical definitions such as marshaling or freight station, train station, division station, <b>dead-end</b> <b>station,</b> railway junction, railway hub etc. Unified Modeling Languages for engineering the automated systems use the definitions: the objects’ categories, the class diagrams, statechart diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, component diagrams, link diagrams in properties etc. These concepts enable formalizing the knowledge, bringing to homogeneous representing and using them for modeling the management processes of goods delivery. Findings. The data on timing the events of goods delivery process, breakings of schedule are taken into account in set-theoretical model on scripting scenarios for goods delivery process. One of the concepts in the model on breaking of schedule (from the knowledge base of the system ASK VPUZ-E enables {{to take into account the}} influence of possible factors and the real railway operations conditions. Originality. The ways to formalize knowledge on railway transportation process as the major premise to form intelligent informational software for management system were analyzed. The set-theoretical models on goods delivery management for scripting goods delivery process’ scenarios have been developed in the paper, the examples of using the means of object-oriented modeling to construct algorithm for technological processes have been given as well. Practical value. The author suggests new terms, definitions and concepts describing the logistic business processes and enabling to changeover to formalizing the knowledge and to forming the conditions of intelligent management system of goods delivery on railways. ...|$|E
