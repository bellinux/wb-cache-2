5|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, Vaughan Williams found musical {{inspiration}} lacking, and experienced his first fallow period since his wartime musical silence.

5|$|As these laudes {{were to be}} {{performed}} with a very limited accompaniment of instruments, they were supposedly performed from the small loft in the high choir of the Thomaskirche, opposite to the large organ loft where the other movements of the Magnificat were performed. The autograph of the E-flat major version of the Magnificat (BWV 243a) suggests that Bach intended to perform the <b>first</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> his Magnificat also without the laudes, depending on circumstances, for example on other feasts than Christmas.|$|E

Although other versions of Monopoly for home computers were already in circulation for play between human players, {{at the time of}} its release Automonopoli was marketed as the <b>first</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the game with an artificial intelligence advanced enough for the computer to play against human players.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius' <b>first</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the Chronicon {{was written}} in 303, and his second in the mid-320s; Jerome's revision, {{translation}} and continuation dates to 380. The original Greek is lost; it is largely through Jerome's Latin and through an Armenian translation unrelated to Jerome that {{the substance of the}} original survives. Eusebius' original did cover Philip's rule—Jerome's continuation of the Chronicon only covers the period from 325 to 378—but the sections regarding Philip's Christianity do not survive in the Armenian translation. In the Armenian, all references to Arabs are omitted. Philip's celebration of the millennium is preserved, while his supposed Christianity is only implied in the entry on Decius' persecution. Jerome's Chronicon is, therefore, the nearest we can get to Eusebius' early statements on Philip's Christianity. That Jerome calls Philip primus in the Chronicon thus admits of two interpretations: either he found it in Eusebius, or he added it independently, based on other sources available to him. Shahîd argues that, while the text would offer a strong case for Philip's Christianity either way, the former interpretation is more plausible. Shahîd believes that primus appeared in Eusebius <b>first</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the Chronicon, but may have been edited out for the second version—by the mid 320s, Eusebius had become Constantine's panegyrist, and was understandably loath to praise his subject's ignoble predecessors.|$|E

5|$|Henry Cameron's platinotype {{reproductions of}} the <b>first</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Hope had {{circulated}} since the painting's exhibition, but {{were slow to}} produce and expensive to buy. From the early 1890s photographer Frederick Hollyer produced large numbers of cheap platinotype reproductions of the second version, particularly after Hollyer formalised his business relationship with Watts in 1896. Hollyer sold the reproductions both via printsellers {{around the country and}} directly via catalogue, and the print proved extremely popular.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the <b>first</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> M-85 {{ran from}} then M-66 east to M-43 at Stanton in Montcalm County. This highway was later {{extended}} in 1929 from Stanton north to Edmore. By {{the end of}} 1930, this designation was removed when M-57 was extended through the area. A new M-85 was then designated between Mayville and Caro. This second designation was supplanted by an extended and rerouted M-24 in late 1941 or early 1942.|$|E

They released 386BSD via an anonymous FTP server. The development flow of 386BSD was slow and after a period of neglect, a group of 386BSD users decided to branch out on their own and create FreeBSD so that they could keep the operating system up to date. The <b>first</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> FreeBSD was released on November 1993.|$|E
