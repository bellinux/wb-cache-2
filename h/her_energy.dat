5|$|Along the way, Samus defeats {{four of the}} Space Pirate bosses, {{including}} Kraid and Ridley, and {{arrives in}} Tourian—the heart of the Space Pirate base. There, she encounters the Metroid larva, which has now grown to an enormous size. It attacks Samus and nearly drains all of <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> before it realizes who she is, and then departs. Samus recharges <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> and confronts Mother Brain, the biomechanical creature that controls the base's systems and all the enemy forces on Zebes. Mother Brain nearly kills Samus, but is then attacked by the Metroid larva, which drains it of its energy and transfers it back to Samus. Mother Brain recovers and destroys the Metroid in retaliation, but is in turn defeated by Samus with the Hyper Beam—an extremely powerful weapon created from the energy given to her by the Metroid. Afterward, a planetary self-destruct sequence begins, which Samus narrowly escapes. If the player rescues the Dachora and the Etecoons—the creatures Samus encountered earlier in the game—during the escape, they are shown leaving the planet in the distance.|$|E
5|$|With the {{cancellation}} of Ellen, DeGeneres focused <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> on stand-up comedy, where she had begun her career. She returned to network television in 2001 with the short-lived The Ellen Show, in which her character Ellen Richmond was openly lesbian from the start, before finding renewed success with her talk show The Ellen DeGeneres Show, beginning in 2003, which as of July 2017 is still running and is in its fourteenth season.|$|E
5|$|Ginetta, then {{seventeen}} years old, was already {{active in the}} resistance movement, delivering food coupons and clothing to Jews who were in hiding. Following her parents' disappearance, she became a courier for resistance forces in Northern Italy, as well as helping to print and distribute antigovernment pamphlets. On one occasion, she dressed as a cleaning lady to steal letterhead from government offices {{so that it could}} be used to forge letters of safe passage to Switzerland. Due to <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> and small size (she never grew to more than five feet tall), she received the nickname Topolino ("Little Mouse").|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19thcentury, other aristocratic women {{began to turn}} away from refined society life and focused on feminist reform. Among them was Anna Pavlovna Filosofova, a woman from an aristocratic Moscow family married to a {{high-ranking}} bureaucrat, who devoted <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> to various societies and projects to benefit the poor and underprivileged in Russian society, including women. Together with Maria Trubnikova, Nadezhda Stasova and Evgenia Konradi, she lobbied the Emperor to create and fund higher education courses for women. She was also {{a founding member of the}} Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society and responsible for helping to organize the All-Women's Congress of 1908.|$|E
5|$|After the Cultural Revolution, Xin Fengxia was {{politically}} rehabilitated in 1979, {{but was unable}} to return to the stage because of her disability. Her performance in Flowers as Matchmakers in 1964 proved to be her last. She devoted <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> to writing, painting, and training the younger generation of pingju performers. In 1997, she published her two-million-word memoir, which has been translated into English and Urdu. Ye Shengtao, the renowned writer and publisher, greatly encouraged her to write. He composed two poems praising her courage and talent. Her paintings, which were decorated with her husband's calligraphy, were also popular, and an exhibition of them was held at the China Military Museum in 1994. She was elected {{as a member of the}} Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Wilkinson {{served in}} Churchill's wartime {{coalition}} {{as a junior}} minister, mainly at the Ministry of Home Security where she worked under Herbert Morrison. She supported Morrison's attempts to replace Clement Attlee as the Labour Party's leader; nevertheless, when he formed his postwar government, Attlee appointed Wilkinson as Minister of Education. By this time, her health was poor, a legacy of years of overwork. She saw her main task in office as {{the implementation of the}} wartime coalition's 1944 Education Act, rather than the more radical introduction of comprehensive schools favoured by many in the Labour Party. Much of <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> was applied to organising the raising of the school-leaving age from 14 to 15. During the exceptionally cold weather of early 1947, she succumbed to a bronchial disease, and died after an overdose of medication, which the coroner at her inquest declared was accidental.|$|E

60|$|Here {{the poor}} girl could say no more; {{for she was}} using all <b>her</b> <b>energies</b> to prevent herself from sobbing in the ball-room.|$|R
60|$|For {{this reason}} she conserved <b>her</b> <b>energies</b> and <b>her</b> voice {{until she could}} see that they had {{approached}} near enough to the camp to attract the succor she craved.|$|R
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, enemies appear in the open field and can be avoided or engaged. The number of enemies increases during night-time, and their strength and ability to deal damage increases the more days pass in-game. By killing all the standard versions of an enemy, a final version appears as a boss. Defeating it will yield a high reward and make the enemy type extinct {{in an area of}} the game. When Lightning attacks an enemy, or they attack her, the battle starts. If Lightning strikes a monster, they lose a small portion of health, while if the enemy strikes Lightning first, she will lose health. As Lightning performs attacks, her ATB meter is drained and she must switch to another assigned garb: the depleted garb's meter recharges while not being used. Lightning utilizes her many swords for short-range melee attacks and magic for long-range attacks. She can block enemy attacks using her shield and has the option to evade an attack, which can be assigned to any garb. Each enemy has a stagger meter, represented by a line behind their health bar. As Lightning lands certain kinds of magical or physical blows on the enemy, their meter oscillates more. Eventually, the enemy is staggered, rendering them vulnerable to damaging attacks. Lightning can also spend Energy Points to perform special moves or activate abilities, such as Overclock (which slows time for Lightning's opponents and enables her to land more hits); and Army of One, Lightning's signature move. By winning battles, Lightning earns gil, the in-game currency, and replenishes a portion of <b>her</b> <b>Energy</b> Point gauge. In Normal and Hard modes, if Lightning flees from or dies in battle, one in-game hour is lost. Unlike the last two games, the player character does not automatically recover HP after battles, instead needing to use remedies bought from merchants and shops, and there is no auto-battle mode, with Lightning needing to be controlled manually at all times. In Easy Mode, Lightning regenerates health if she stands idle.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} game, the Xbox {{exclusive}} Halo 4, Cortana wakes the Chief when forces from an Ex-Covenant splinter faction attack {{the remains of}} the UNSC Forward Unto Dawn, then crashes with him on Requiem. Over the course of the game, Cortana begins showing strange signs and behavior: vocal and graphic glitches, irrational behavior and a tendency to become irritable or angered. Their cause is soon revealed: Cortana's operation beyond her seven-year lifespan and her interaction with the Halo installations and the Flood have caused her to become Rampant, a state of over-knowledge that makes AIs 'think' themselves to death. Helped by the Master Chief and kept safe from the captain of the Infinity, who wishes to delete her, she helps in the battle against the Didact, a rogue Forerunner who hates humans, and stops his scheme to convert all of humanity into his mechanical Promethean army using the Composer. In doing so, she has to fragment her various rampant personalities and upload them into the system, which first brings down the shields around the central core, then enables her to save Master Chief from the Didact. In a final act of love, she shields the Master Chief when he destroys the Composer, then, using the last of <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> to manifest as a solid hologram, she bids a final farewell to the Chief, managing to touch him for the first time.|$|E
25|$|<b>Her</b> <b>energy</b> and stamina, which {{sometimes}} exhausted her co-workers, continued at a remarkable level. At age 75, she toured Yosemite National Park {{on the back}} of a mule.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Jane Frank turned <b>her</b> <b>energies</b> toward the {{creation}} of free-standing sculpture, i.e., sculptures properly speaking, as opposed to [...] "sculptural paintings" [...] or mixed media works on canvas.|$|R
50|$|Dee Jay Mailer is the Chief Executive Officer of Kamehameha Schools. She was {{appointed}} on January 19, 2004, and now focuses <b>her</b> <b>energies</b> on educating children of Hawaiian ancestry. She is a 1970 graduate of Kamehameha.|$|R
50|$|In 1867 Zara Mahurin married Port Wilson, a {{merchant}} of Goodland, Indiana. Owing to broken health, <b>her</b> <b>energies</b> were {{for ten years}} confined mostly to home duties and the care of her only child, a son.|$|R
25|$|She {{exercised}} {{the leadership}} of her regional group {{for five years and}} left it in February 2009 since she preferred to devote <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> to the European election campaign in the constituency of North-West France. A member of the standing committee, she led a strong opposition facing the left-wing regional executive managed by Jean-Paul Huchon.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Cheng {{had only}} one feature film release and no music projects. She became a {{representative}} for Veeko and Titus, a fashion and watch brand in Hong Kong, respectively. She also began writing Saturday columns for Mingpao magazine. In 2006, she released another greatest hits album, {{but there were no}} new tracks. The break was taken to recoup <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> from the entertainment industry.|$|E
25|$|In the Philippines, in 2004, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo {{outlined}} <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> policy. She {{wants to}} increase indigenous {{oil and gas}} reserves through exploration, develop alternative energy resources, enforce the development of natural gas as a fuel and coco diesel as alternative fuel, and build partnerships with Saudi Arabia, Asian countries, China and Russia. She also made public plans to convert the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant into a gas-powered facility.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout the 1990s, Pamella {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} several unreleased records with multi-platinum producer Darryl [...] "Dok" [...] Ross.

50|$|In {{the city}} of Asuwa, Lady Death recovers the sword Deathbringer, which was {{specially}} made for her by Satasha and The Silent One. Deathbringer is able to withstand <b>her</b> <b>energies</b> without being destroyed, and allows her to channel her magic through it.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, {{she played}} an {{alcoholic}} widow {{in the crime}} drama Warning Shot, a talent scout who discovers a Hollywood star in The Oscar, and a rich alcoholic in An American Dream. From the late 1960s, television would occupy more of <b>her</b> <b>energies.</b>|$|R
25|$|Though {{her career}} and {{personal}} life were challenging after {{the cancellation of}} the show, Cho eventually sobered up, refocused <b>her</b> <b>energy,</b> and developed new material. She hosted the New Year's Rockin' Eve 95 show with Steve Harvey. In 1997, she had a supporting role in the thriller filmFace/Off starring Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, {{playing the role of}} Wanda, one of the fellow FBI agents of Travolta's primary character.|$|E
25|$|Grossman was {{credited}} with showing a footwear company how to be an apparel company. She brought her strong fashion background to Nike's apparel and regenerated it, devoting much of <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> to the company's weaker women's wear business. Nike's apparel business's annual revenue was $2.7 billion when she joined in 2000; {{by the end of}} fiscal year 2005 she had grown it to $4.1 billion, which was 32% of Nike brand revenues.|$|E
25|$|In 1893, {{soon after}} {{becoming}} {{a member of}} the Theosophical Society she went to India for the first time. After a dispute the American section split away into an independent organisation. The original society, then led by Henry Steel Olcott and Besant, is today based in Chennai, India, and is known as the Theosophical Society Adyar. Following the split Besant devoted much of <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> not only to the society, but also to India's freedom and progress. Besant Nagar, a neighbourhood near the Theosophical Society in Chennai, is named in her honour.|$|E
50|$|Her {{decision}} to stop touring and recording {{at the end}} of the 1980s was not fueled by the grueling schedule, as some might guess, but by her desire to bring more of herself to the music, she turned <b>her</b> <b>energies</b> to songwriting.|$|R
6000|$|... "She does not; but {{you will}} keep her from being turned back. It is just the thing to prevent <b>her</b> <b>energies</b> from running to waste, and her being so much with you, and working under you, is exactly what one would have chosen." ...|$|R
50|$|She is {{also able}} to charge other {{individuals}} by transferring to them <b>her</b> own life <b>energy,</b> in the process enhancing their physical state of health (she has twice used this ability to save dying individuals) and granting them low-level super-powers, which are apparently at random and otherwise unrelated to Sabra's own mutant powers (such as the wind-generating powers given {{to a woman who}} took the costumed identity Windstorm). The recipient retains their new powers until Sabra herself decides to withdraw them by retrieving <b>her</b> life <b>energy.</b> <b>Her</b> standard power levels drop when she gives away <b>her</b> life <b>energy</b> (she has been shown losing up to half her natural physical power), but they return to normal once she takes back <b>her</b> life <b>energy.</b> She still remains susceptible to gas attacks.|$|R
25|$|Carrie Chapman Catt {{joined the}} {{suffrage}} movement in Iowa in the mid-1880s and soon {{became part of}} the leadership of the state suffrage association. Married to a wealthy engineer who encouraged her suffrage work, she was able to devote much of <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> to the movement. In 1895, she was placed in charge of NAWSA's Organizational Committee, where she raised money to put a team of fourteen organizers in the field. By 1899, suffrage organizations had been established in every state. When Anthony retired as NAWSA president in 1900, she arranged for Catt, who had not been closely associated with either the NWSA or the AWSA, to succeed her.|$|E
25|$|Nadezhda von Meck {{saw things}} very differently. To her, filling {{the roles of}} mother, nurse, governess, dressmaker, housekeeper, and valet was far easier to bear than the humiliation of seeing her husband as a cog in the machine of a {{government}} organization. Neither did fulfilling all those domestic duties lower her resolve or weaken <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> in urging {{him to make a}} break. Russia, desperately short of railways, was expanding its communications network rapidly, and Nadezhda was far-sighted enough to see that a future for her husband lay there. She continually exerted pressure on him to find a partner with capital and to join the boom in Russian railway construction.|$|E
25|$|As a suffragist (as {{opposed to}} a suffragette), she took a {{moderate}} line, but was a tireless campaigner. She concentrated much of <b>her</b> <b>energy</b> on the struggle to improve women's opportunities for higher education and in 1875 co-founded Newnham College, Cambridge. She later {{became president of the}} National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (the NUWSS), a position she held from 1897 until 1919. In July 1901 she was appointed to lead the British government's commission to South Africa to investigate conditions in the concentration camps that had been created there {{in the wake of the}} Second Boer War. Her report corroborated what the campaigner Emily Hobhouse had said about conditions in the camps.|$|E
50|$|Leslie Peirce {{sees the}} year 1656 as {{a turning point}} in Turhan’s life. By {{providing}} the grand vizier with “unlimited” authority, Turhan limited her own power on the political stage.
