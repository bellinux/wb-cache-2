40|$|Two muramyl dipeptides, N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine and its adjuvant-inactive isomer N-acetylmuramyl-D-alanyl-D-isoglutamine, were {{examined}} {{for their ability}} to protect mice carrying the CBA/N immune deficiency gene (xid) against lethal bacterial challenge. Prophylactic treatment with N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-d-isoglutamine gave significant protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Salmonella enteritidis infection. N-Acetylmuramyl-D-alanyl-D-isoglutamine was unable to confer protection. Incorporation of the lipophilic <b>glycerol</b> <b>dipalmitate</b> derivatives of the two muramyl dipeptides within liposomal carriers resulted in a significant enhancement of anti-infectious activity, both with respect to number of survivors and length of survival. Liposomal muramyl dipeptides were 10 - to 15 -fold more potent than free muramyl dipeptide; enhanced potency was most evident with N-acetylmuramyl-D-alanyl-D-isoglutamine. Prophylactic treatment with liposomes containing the lipophilic muramyl dipeptides resulted in enhanced clearance of bacteria from the blood (greater than 3 -fold increase in rate) when compared with that of hydrosoluble N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine, indicating a correlation between reticuloendothelial stimulation and anti-infectious activity...|$|E
