Themain aim was to reduce heat transfer and to utilize the maximum energy available from heater toheat the water. To observe the effects of essential geometrical and operating parameters on thesystem performance, different computational test cases were run for three different designs. In the first case of simulation, the immersion heater of existing design mounted on a water tankhas been analyzed. The cold-water tank with inlet and outlet and given appropriate boundaryconditions was used to see the temperature contours inside the water tank and temperature of theimmersion layer itself. In the second case, an <b>insulation</b> <b>plate</b> has been introduced in the immersion heater head in orderto reduce heat loss by considering the possible heat leakage through the gap inside the heaterhead by radiation. In the third case, an insulation ring has been introduced in the immersion heater head as asubstitute for the <b>insulation</b> <b>plate</b> which has the same aim as second case. The results obtained from the CFD simulation shows the thermal performance of immersionheater in a water tank for three different cases. The results are helpful in optimizing both heatingelement and immersion heater by introducing different changes to optimize the design. It showsthat the redesigned immersion heater and storage tank can provide improved working conditions. Also, at early design stages, CFD simulations {{could be used as}} an effective tool to optimizethermal storage tank parameters, so it may add value to the storage tank and immersion heaterperformance and efficiency, by optimizing the whole thermal heating system design and size.

(2) We conducted numerical simulation and scale model experiments in an anechoic room to examine the noise reducing effect when sound absorbing material was provided on the car body surface in order to reduce the multiple reflections between the noise barrier and car body. 2. 1 Overview The Series E 2 - 1000 cars were provided with low-noise pantographs and low-noise insulators in order to reduce the noise of the electric-current collection system. Running tests were conducted to examine the electric-current collecting performance of the low-noise pantograph and low-noise insulator, and the effect of reducing the noise of the electric-current collecting system. For further reduction of the noise from the electric-current collecting system, the pantograph was temporarily provided with a sound <b>insulation</b> <b>plates.</b> To reduce the number of noise sources, a single-pantograph running test was performed to evaluate the effect. In the meantime, the noise from the electric-current collecting system has been reduced in recent years because of some countermeasures.

40|$|The {{proposed}} multi-component façade {{system is}} made of porous concretes employed both as bearing structures and for heat insulation and fireproofing purposes. The authors also provide their recommendations in respect of the mounting of the proposed façade system. The façade system considered in the article is composed of wall foam concrete blocks reinforced by basalt fibers (bearing elements of the structure), cellular concrete polystyrene (thermal insulation), and porous concrete (fireproofing and thermal insulation). Retained shuttering (in the fireproofing sections) represents chrysolite cement sheets attached to the structures composed of glass-fiber plastic elements. The application of insulating porous concrete as a fireproofing material {{is based on the}} principle of adjustable stress-strained states of materials in the environment of variable pressure. This technology was developed at Moscow State University of Civil Engineering, and it was initially designated for the manufacturing of tailor-made products. The above concrete is also designated for retained shuttering and modified cavity masonry walls. Porous concrete that expands inside the fireproofing cavity ensures a tight contact both with the basic material and thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>plates.</b> The use of materials of the same origin (Portland cement) means the formation of strong transition zones connecting the system components in the course of its hardening and further operation. The results of the thermotechnical calculation demonstrate that the thermal resistance registered {{on the surface of the}} wall that is 3 meters high (that has a 0. 4 m fireproofing cavity) is equal to 3. 98 sq. m.

40|$|Air {{cavities}} between {{plates are}} often used to improve noise insulation by passive means, especially at high frequencies. Such configurations may suffer from resonances, such as due to the mass-air-mass resonance. Lightweight structures, {{which tend to be}} undamped, may suffer from structural resonances as well. Active methods have been suggested for improved noise <b>insulation</b> of <b>plates,</b> using piezoelectric patch actuators or inertial mass actuators. Other active methods for improved noise insulation can be based on acoustic control of the sound field in the cavity, using acoustic sources and acoustic sensors. Methods based on feedforward control of the sound radiated from such panels with air cavity usually suffer from an irregular frequency response of the actuators on the radiating panel and insufficient acoustic control authority at low frequencies.

40|$|Due to variabilities in the material, the {{geometrical}} configuration, or {{the manufacturing}} properties, {{a structure that}} is designed to be spatially periodic cannot be exactly periodic.

40|$|A {{method to}} {{determine}} the optimum thicknesses of insulation and load-carrying structure {{has been applied to}} insulated compression plates subjected to aerodynamic heating. The optimum design results in the lowest combined weight of <b>insulation</b> and load-carrying <b>plate.</b> Load parameters which included the imposed load, insulation conductivity and density, and flight time were found for design strength criteria of compressive yield, compressive buckling, and postbuckling failure. Charts of optimum total weight were prepared for 2024 -T 3 aluminum alloy, HK 3 lA magnesium alloy, 17 - 7 PH stainless steel, and Inconel X for each design criterion.

40|$|Plates with {{attached}} beams or ribs, {{rather than}} monolithic plates, are commonly employed in civil and mechanical engineering {{for reasons of}} weight and static stiffness. Unfortunately, attaching stiffeners to a plain plate generally increases its radiation efficiency and reduces its airborne sound insulation. This contribution aims at gaining insight into the sound <b>insulation</b> of rib-stiffened <b>plates</b> in the mid-frequency range, where the modal behavior of the plate is still important, but the neighboring sound fields can already be considered as diffuse. A detailed finite element model of a PMMA plate with steel stiffeners attached is constructed and coupled to a reverberant sound field model of the adjoining room(s) within the recently developed hybrid finite element - statistical energy analysis framework. This framework is computationally very efficient, it enables to compute the coupling loss factors between the sound fields in a rigorous, straight forward way, and the uncertainties due to random wave scattering - which is the physical origin of the diffuse field - can be quantified. The finite element model of the plate is first calibrated by minimizing the difference between its lowest natural frequencies and mode shapes and the corresponding measured values. The hybrid model is then employed for predicting the sound reduction index across the building acoustics frequency range. These predictions are validated against airborne sound insulation measurements. Within a wide frequency range, pronounced dips are observed at specific natural frequencies of the plate, at which the wavelength of the corresponding mode shape {{is close to the}} free acoustic wavelength. Since there is an obvious connection with the coincidence phenomenon for infinite plates, the observed phenomenon is termed the semi-discrete coincidence phenomenon. It is shown that in the mid-frequency range, an important increase in airborne sound insulation can be achieved by suppressing only a few particular resonances of the considered rib-stiffened plate. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|As {{shown by}} the Phoenix Mars Lander's Thermal and Electrical Conductivity Probe (TECP), contact {{measurements}} of thermal conductivity and diffusivity (using a modified flux-plate or line-source heat-pulse method) are constrained {{by a number of}} factors. Robotic resources must be used to place the probe, making them unavailable for other operations {{for the duration of the}} measurement. The range of placement is also limited by mobility, particularly in the case of a lander. Placement is also subject to irregularities in contact quality, resulting in non-repeatable heat transfer to the material under test. Most important from a scientific perspective, the varieties of materials which can be measured are limited to unconsolidated or weakly-cohesive regolith materials, rocks, and ices being too hard for nominal insertion strengths. Accurately measuring thermal properties in the laboratory requires significant experimental finesse, involving sample preparation, controlled and repeatable procedures, and, practically, instrumentation much more voluminous than the sample being tested (heater <b>plates,</b> <b>insulation,</b> temperature sensors). Remote measurements (infrared images from orbiting spacecraft) can reveal composite properties like thermal inertia, but suffer both from a large footprint (low spatial resolution) and convolution of the thermal properties of a potentially layered medium. In situ measurement techniques (the Phoenix TECP is the only robotic measurement of thermal properties to date) suffer from problems of placement range, placement quality, occupation of robotic resources, and the ability to only measure materials of low mechanical strength. A spacecraft needs the ability to perform a non-contact thermal properties measurement in situ. Essential components include low power consumption, leveraging of existing or highly-developed flight technologies, and mechanical simplicity. This new in situ method, by virtue of its being non-contact, bypasses all of these problems. The use of photons to both excite and measure the thermal response of any surface material to a high resolution (estimated footprint = 10 square centimeters) is a generational leap in physical properties measurements. The proposed method consists of spot-heating the surface of a material with a low (less than 1 W) power laser. This produces a moderate (5 - 10 K) temperature increase in the material...|$|R
