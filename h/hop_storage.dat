For beer wort hopping, hop pellets of diff erent age (“slightly aged ” and “strongly aged” one) and storage indexes (0. 35 and 0. 59, respectively) were used.

Chem. 58 (2) : 73 - 82, 2000 Two {{approaches}} {{were examined}} for {{the preparation of}} near-infrared (NIR) calibrations for the prediction of α-acids content, β-acids content, and <b>hop</b> <b>storage</b> index (HSI) in baled hop samples. In the first approach, NIR calibrations were developed using a hop sample calibration set that was representative of the full analytical range of values for each con-stituent (α-acids: 1. 86 – 19. 57 %; β-acids: 1. 45 – 11. 58 %; and HSI values: 0. 220 – 0. 480). In the second approach, hop samples were segregated by α-acids content before calibration development. NIR calibrations were produced from calibration sets with high (9 – 20 %), medium (6 – 10 %), and low (1 – 7 %) α-acids contents. For α-acids predictions, the overall per-formance of the full-analytical-range α-acids calibration (first approach) was comparable to calibrations prepared using either the high- or medium-α-acids-range calibration sets. The standard error of cross vali-dation (SECV) and coefficient of determination (r 2) values for the full-analytical-range α-acids calibration were 0. 31 % and 0. 99, respectively. The α-acids calibration prepared from the low-α-acids-range set had the best overall performance statistics of all the α-acids calibrations devel-oped. The SECV and r 2 values for that calibration were 0. 22 % and 0. 97, respectively. NIR calibrations for β-acids and HSI were not substantially improved when calibrations were produced using hop samples segregated into high, medium, and low α-acids ranges. The SECV and r 2 values for the full-analytical-range ß-acids and HSI calibrations were 0. 20 % and 0. 99, and 0. 010 and 0. 89, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Hop pellets type 90 are {{the most}} {{frequent}} hop products used in brewing. They are usually manufactured by drying <b>hop</b> cones, temporary <b>storage</b> of dry and pressed cones, milling and pelletising. Other possibility is a complete integration of hop harvest, cone drying, milling and pelletising in continuous process without temporary storage of pressed cones. The paper deals with the losses of bitter substances (primary α-acids) during hop cones drying, their pelletisation by two manufacturing procedures and storage in different conditions. The {{results of this study}} show that integrated procedure of hop pelletising decreases the total loss of α-acids compared to the usual procedure. During <b>storage</b> of <b>hop</b> pellets (produced by integrated procedure) the highest decrease (loss) of α-acids content was observed in pellets stored at 21 °C in the presence of air and the lowest under inert atmosphere (N 2) at 4 to 7 °C, respectively. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} hops is {{significantly}} {{affected by the}} content of alpha bitter acids. Maintaining it with minimum losses lies within the competence of both the hop grower and processor depending on how they follow the optimum harvest technology, storage conditions, and post-harvest hop processing. That indicator is considerably affected by the <b>hop</b> <b>storage</b> method, i. e. whether the warehouse is air-conditioned or not, {{as well as the}} storage duration. The alpha bitter acid content should not be reduced during storage. The objective of this paper is an analysis of the alpha bitter acid content in the Saaz hop variety in a technological sequence of operations starting with drying at the grower and finishing with six-month storing at the processor, with three storage variants: an air-conditioned warehouse, non-conditioned warehouse, and a variant in which the square bale is moved after 60 days from a non-conditioned warehouse into an air-conditioned warehouse. The analysis of samples to identify the alpha bitter acid content was carried out by means of the ASBC Hops- 6 and the HPLC EBC 7. 7 methods. Practically in all cases the alpha content declines, although if a square bale is placed in an air-conditioned warehouse this decline is the lowest depending on the storage duration. The economic analysis shows a significant profit referring to the price of alpha contained in 1 t of hops stored in an air-conditioned warehouse. At the date of 1 / 11 / 2015 this profit was 14 706 CZK, at the date of 4 / 1 / 2016 it was 7646 CZK, and at 1 / 3 / 2016 the profit was 6587 CZK...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Hops (Humulus lupulus L.) are {{primarily}} {{used to provide}} specific characteristics to beer, such as bitterness, aroma, flavor, and microbial stability. The chemical composition of hops, relative to how they are used during the brewing process, dictates the expression of these characteristics. Of the raw ingredients that go into making beer, hops {{are perhaps the most}} costly. Considerable resources are required to grow quality hops, and therefore, brewers and hop growers alike have a common goal of obtaining the highest quality hops possible. However, quality can be a relative term. While it is commonly agreed upon that high brewing values, such as α-acids and essential oil content, and robust structural integrity are indicators of quality hops, there are many opinions of the ideal aroma. Changes in the chemical composition of hops during plant maturation are a dynamic process requiring a comprehensive, in-depth chemical and sensory analysis in order to maximize the characteristics of interest to brewers. The complex aroma chemistry associated with hops in beer has been a confounding variable for the practical brewer, and a deeper understanding of hop aroma development during cultivation is needed. The effect of harvest date, location, and cultivar on key chemical components of Willamette and Cascade hops was investigated for the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. Hops were harvested at 3 time points (Early, Typical, and Late), within a 3 -week interval from 2 different farms in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. A split-plot experimental design for each cultivar was used; each farm represented a main plot and harvest years were designated as subplots. American Society of Brewing Chemist standard methods of analysis were used to measure moisture content, hop acids and their homologs, <b>Hop</b> <b>Storage</b> Index, total essential oil content and volatile profile by GC-FID. Additionally, difference testing, descriptive analysis, and consumer acceptance testing was conducted using beers brewed with either Typical or Late harvested Cascade hops from the 2010 harvest year. The response of analytes was dependent on the cultivar being examined, its location within the Willamette Valley, as well as days until harvest. Hop acids did not change appreciably during plant maturation for the period examined, while hop oil content increased hyperbolically to a plateau as the hops aged on the bine. Increases in oil quantity were strongly correlated (r > 0. 90) with increases in α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, methyl heptanoate, and linalool concentrations. For Cascade, α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, ρ-cymene, caryophyllene, E, β-farnesene, and humulene all increased from Early to Typical points but no increase was observed between the Typical and Late time point. Linalool and methyl heptanoate increased between each time point while citral and humulene epoxide differed between Early harvest and Late harvest, but not between Early and Typical or Late and Typical harvests. For Willamette hops, α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, ρ-cymene, and linalool all increased between each time point. Caryophyllene, E β-farnesene, humulene, farnesol and citral all increased from Early harvest to Typical harvest but no difference was observed between Typical and Late.

50|$|Deep {{research}} into the anatomy of large mammals such as, kangaroos and other large ungulates such as deer and gazelle, suggests strongly {{that some sort of}} elastic mechanism is important for this energetic savings. Previous combination of careful experiments, with anatomical (e.g. tendon dimensions), mechanical (e.g. force plate recordings) and mathematical calculations revealed that a significant fraction of the work done with each step could be provided by the spring-like action of tendons, rather than by muscle work.When the animal’s foot contacts the surface of the ground during high speed locomotion, the tendon or ligament is pressed tightly together, storing elastic energy much like a compressed spring. As the foot gets of the ground, the pressure on the compressed tendons and ligaments is released, and elastic recoil from these spring like structures provides additional force to propel the animal thus resulting in energetic savings. Simple calculations based kangaroo hopping and forces involved in <b>hopping</b> show how <b>storage</b> of elastic strain energy can save twenty to thirty percent of metabolic energy required for hopping. Measurements of oxygen consumption with fluctuations of kinetic and gravitational potential energy, indicate elastic savings of at least fifty four percent at high speeds.|$|R
40|$|Muscle force, {{electromyogram}} {{and length}} were monitored in the medial {{head of the}} gastrocnemius (MG) muscle in freely hopping wallabies (Thylogale billardierii Desmarest). During take-off hops from rest, MG muscle developed force with an isometric contraction. For constant-speed hops, force was produced in MG muscle during rapid stretch. The muscle resisted this stretch with a constant impedance that was independent of hopping speed. The rate of stretch of the muscle during high-speed hopping was as high as l m s " 1 (5 - 6 muscle lengths per second) {{at the onset of}} stretch and slowed to no stretch at the peak of force. Since the mechanical impedance was constant while the stretch velocity changed, there was no significant viscosity present in the muscle. The tendon stretched by 3 - 2 % at 7 k m h- 1 hopping and by 4 - 4 % at lSkmh" 1 <b>hopping.</b> Elastic energy <b>storage</b> in the tendons increased with hopping speed but the percentage of total work done by elastic recoil of the whole muscle did not increase at higher hopping speeds. The significance of the muscle stretch is in producing high forces rapidly and, in addition, there is considerable energy storage in the tendons...|$|R
