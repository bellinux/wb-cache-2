5000|$|Reygadas' use of nonprofessional actors shows {{influence}} from Italian neorealist philosophies on cinema. While {{this is a}} characteristic found in many independent movies, Reygadas is set apart by his ability to fully engage with his actors while guiding them through an internal process by which they can embody scenes that are both physically and emotionally demanding. Reygadas has metaphorically likened the relation between a director {{and his or her}} actors to a complete vote of confidence in which both take a risk and enter an adventure: [...] "Pretend I'm a climber and invite <b>you</b> to the <b>Everest.</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that I have gone twice and there are certain risks: you can have a stroke, fall or die because of an avalanche. You {{decide whether or not to}} go up with me. And that's it." [...] For him, cinema is closer to photography than to the dramatic arts and hence more focused on capturing the essence of a character through the person filmed than the individual's acting ability.|$|R

Hank also is a supporter of the Texas Longhorns. He also follows baseball as a fan of the Texas Rangers, although in [...] "Meet The Manger Babies", he stated that he would rather miss a baseball game than the Super Bowl to help Luanne with her puppet show. However his idyllic passion is golf which coincides with his love of lawns. He once converted his back yard into a putting green. He is however critical of some sports. He is critical of soccer, claiming to Bobby [...] "I didn't think <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> needed to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> this, but I would be a bad parent if I didn't; Soccer was invented by European ladies to keep them busy while their husbands did the cooking".

He leaned forward again, and said across Mrs. Montgomery, as before: [...] "She was gettin' off the train from Pymantoning, and I was just takin' my train West, but I knew it was her as soon as I saw her walk.

60|$|While I was {{directing}} {{that the}} necessary {{care should be}} taken of her, Clara came in; she was trembling and pale; and, when I anxiously asked her the cause of her agitation, she threw herself into my arms weeping and exclaiming--"Uncle, dearest uncle, do not hate me for <b>ever!</b> <b>I</b> must <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> for you must know, that Evelyn, poor little Evelyn"--her voice was choked by sobs. The fear of so mighty a calamity as the loss of our adored infant made the current of my blood pause with chilly horror; but the remembrance of the mother restored my presence of mind.

Idris must not see him in this state. Clara, though only twelve years old, was rendered, through extreme sensibility, so prudent and careful, that I felt secure in entrusting the charge of him to her, and it was my task to prevent Idris from observing their absence. I administered the fitting remedies, and left my sweet niece to watch beside him, and bring me notice of any change she should observe.|$|R
