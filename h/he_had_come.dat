5|$|Berger later {{claimed that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> {{up with the}} idea of SS combat troops wearing {{camouflage}} jackets from his own hunting days, and had suggested it to SS-Obergruppenführer Sepp Dietrich, commander of the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Regiment (LSSAH). From 1938, various forms of Flecktarn camouflage were issued. The author Adrian Weale doubts Berger's account.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, the French and American armies met at White Plains, {{north of}} New York City. Although Rochambeau had almost 40 years of warfare experience, he never {{challenged}} Washington's authority, telling Washington <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to serve, not to command.|$|E

5|$|Wallis's {{first choice}} for {{director}} was William Wyler, {{but he was}} unavailable, so Wallis turned to his close friend Michael Curtiz. Curtiz was a Hungarian Jewish émigré; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to the U.S. in 1926, but some of his family were refugees from Nazi Europe.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the plan, Ivan and his cavalry approached Constantinople while Michael Shishman waited in Yambol with his army. The plot was uncovered by the spies of Andronikos III. Fearing for his own imperial ambitions, {{he wrote to his}} rival and grandfather not to accept the Bulgarians into the capital. While Ivan stuck to the plan and signed an oath that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> with peace to persuade the Byzantines, he promptly retreated to Bulgarian territory upon receiving that order from Michael Shishman.|$|E
5|$|By March 1964, MalcolmX {{had grown}} disillusioned with the Nation of Islam and its leader Elijah Muhammad. Expressing many regrets about {{his time with}} them, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to regard as largely wasted, he embraced Sunni Islam. After a period of travel in Africa and the Middle East, which {{included}} completing the Hajj, he also became known as el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz. He repudiated the Nation of Islam, disavowed racism and founded Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. He continued to emphasize Pan-Africanism, black self-determination, and black self-defense.|$|E

5|$|Charles Guinand Blackader {{was born}} in Richmond, Surrey on 20 September 1869. His father, Charles George Blackader, was a teacher to {{a small number of}} {{boarding}} pupils; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> from an Army family, and taught at Cheltenham College and Clifton College, Bristol, before moving to private tuition. His mother, Charlotte Guinand, {{was born in}} Germany; her family may have come from Alsace-Lorraine, as Blackader would later describe himself as half-French. During his childhood, the Blackaders moved from Richmond to Southampton, where his father headed the education department at the Hartley Institute, and then to Boulogne, where he taught at Beaurepaire School.|$|E
5|$|During September and October of the 1999–2000 season, Boulding {{scored in}} four {{successive}} league games. However, {{he could only}} score another two goals {{during the rest of}} the campaign to once again record a tally of six goals. His last goal came only two minutes after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> on as a substitute during Mansfield's penultimate game of the season against Scunthorpe United, which helped the team to their fourth successive home victory and a final league position of 13th. Boulding's two-year contract with Mansfield had finished and he left after playing 74appearances in all competitions for Mansfield, of which 41 were as a substitute. During his two seasons he scored 12goals, all in the league.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{three out}} of the serial's twelve episodes have been recovered. 16mm copies of episodes 5 and 10 were {{returned}} in the early 1980s, under unclear circumstances (with rumour claiming they {{were found in the}} basement of a Mormon church). Episode 2 was returned in 2004 by former BBC engineer Francis Watson. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> across the film in the 1970s, while clearing a projector testing room at the BBC's Ealing Studios. Instead of disposing of the film as instructed, he brought it home – eventually to return it to the Corporation when he realised the value of the material.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the famous}} Modernist writers who {{spent time in}} Paris, Ernest Hemingway never made an {{appearance}} at the salon. James Joyce came once or twice but didn't care for it. Marcel Proust never attended a Friday, though he did come to 20, Rue Jacob once to talk with Barney about lesbian culture whilst doing research for In Search of Lost Time. His visit was delayed repeatedly owing to his poor health, and when the meeting finally did happen he was too nervous {{to bring up the}} subject <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to talk about.|$|E
5|$|On January 28, Khánh {{flew from}} Huế to Saigon dressed in {{civilian}} clothes on a commercial airliner. He covered for his ruse by claiming that he was travelling with United States military adviser Colonel Jasper Wilson and stating that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> for a dental appointment. This came after Duc had arrived in I Corps {{earlier in the day}} with a message from the other plotters that Khánh was to be in Saigon to lead the coup on the day after. What Khánh had actually done was to send Wilson to Saigon earlier in the day to check with the embassy and confirm that Washington did support the coup.|$|E

It was Humber's first career complete game, although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> close to achieving no-hitters on several occasions at several levels of organized baseball.

5|$|Shepstone {{arrived in}} Pretoria in January 1877. He {{outlined}} criticisms expressed by Carnarvon regarding the Transvaal government and {{expressed support for}} federation. After a joint commission of inquiry on the British grievances—Kruger and the State Attorney EJP Jorissen refuted most of Carnarvon's allegations, {{one of which was}} that Pretoria tolerated slavery—Shepstone stayed in the capital, openly telling Burgers <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to the Transvaal to annex it. Hoping to stop the annexation by reforming the government, Burgers introduced scores of bills and revisions to a bewildered volksraad, which opposed them all but then passed them, heightening the general mood of discord and confusion. One of these reforms appointed Kruger to the new post of Vice-President.|$|E
5|$|Suleiman {{said that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to protect John Sigismund's interests, but also {{announced}} {{that he wanted to}} see the infant king, because he had heard rumours about Isabella's having actually given birth to a daughter. Six Hungarian lords (including George Martinuzzi and Bálint Török) accompanied John Sigismund to the sultan's camp on 29August. During the meeting, janissaries entered Buda, saying that they wanted to see the town. This {{turned out to be a}} trick that enabled them to seize the capital of Hungary without opposition. Bálint Török was captured in the sultan's camp. Suleiman declared that John Sigismund could retain the territories to the east of the river Tisza in exchange for a yearly tribute of 10,000 florins.|$|E

5|$|The general's objectivity, however, {{has often}} been questioned. Vlahogiannis, in his preface to the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his lack of objectivity and impartiality. While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds a grudge against people <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> into conflict with. He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis, while staying silent about the more questionable deeds of people he had a favourable opinion of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not stem from selfishness, but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Highway3 dates back over 200 {{years to the}} {{pioneering}} settlement era of Upper Canada following the American Revolution and the resulting influx of United Empire Loyalists. Thomas Talbot, an influential scion who joined the British army {{at the age of}} 11, would challenge the government, the terrain, and the forces of nature {{to see to it that}} his road be built. Due to his family legacy, Talbot worked through the ranks quickly and found himself a personal aide to John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. He returned to England after Simcoe fell ill, but vowed to return to the hinterland <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to love.|$|E

Her paternal grandfather, A Wong Wong, was a merchant who owned two stores in Michigan Hills, a gold-mining area in Placer County. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> from Chang On, a village near Taishan, Guangdong Province, China in 1853. Anna May's father spent his youth traveling between the U.S. and China, where he married his first wife and fathered a son in 1890. He returned to the U.S. in the late 1890s and in 1901, while continuing to support his family in China, he married a second wife, Anna May's mother.
