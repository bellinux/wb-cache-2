Qapital directs each of its users to set savings goals, then automatically transfers money from their checking account to an account for savings, when a rule established in the app is met. It uses the [...] "if this then that" [...] (<b>IFTT)</b> rule-based web-service. For example, one rule could be that if a user purchases a cup of coffee, then the app will round up the charge to the nearest dollar and deposit the difference into savings. Users connect their bank accounts to Qapital, so it knows when purchases are made. When a rule is met, money for savings are transferred to a Qapital account operated in partnership with Lincoln Savings Bank.|$|E

40|$|Background/Purpose Isolated Fallopian tube torsion (<b>IFTT)</b> {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} acute {{abdominal}} pain in female. The preoperative diagnosis is difficult {{because of a lack}} of specific clinical and radiological signs. Surgery is often performed when is no longer possible to preserve the integrity of the tube. We report our experience in the laparoscopic management of four teenagers with <b>IFTT.</b> Methods Four patients (aged 12 to 15 years) came to our observation for worsening abdominal pain, nausea and vomit. At admission all girls had blood tests, ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance. Laparoscopy was performed in all cases for the diagnosis. All girls had US and clinic follow up. Results Laparoscopic exploration allowed the diagnosis of <b>IFTT</b> with necrosis of the same in all cases. In two girls a laparoscopic salpingectomy was performed. In the others two cases an open salpingectomy was necessary because of pelvic adhesions. Histology showed an hemorrhagic infarction of the fallopian tubes.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{synthetic}} test {{that uses a}} workflow consisting of a new frequency-dependent traveltime tomography (FDTT) method to provide a starting model for full waveform inversion (FWI) for near-surface seismic velocity estimation from refraction data. Commonly used ray-theory-based traveltime tomography methods may not be valid in the near surface given the likelihood of relatively large seismic wavelengths compared to the length scales of heterogeneities that are possible in the near surface. FDTT makes use of the frequency content in the seismic waves in both the forward and inverse modeling steps. In this application to a near-surface benchmark model, {{the results show that}} FDTT can better recover the magnitude of velocity anomalies than infinite frequency (ray-theory) traveltime tomography (<b>IFTT).</b> FWI can fail by converging to a local minimum when there is an absence of sufficiently low frequency data and an accurate starting model, either of which, if present, can provide long-wavelength constraints on the inverted velocity model. Both <b>IFTT</b> and FDTT models can serve as adequate starting models for FWI. However, FWI produces significantly better results starting from the FDTT model as compared to the <b>IFTT</b> model when low frequency data are not available. The final FWI models provide wavelength-scale structures allowing for direct geologic interpretation from the velocity model itself, demonstrating the effectiveness of FDTT and FWI in near-surface studies given the modest experiment and data requirements of refraction surveys...|$|E
40|$|I {{demonstrate}} the utility {{and benefits of}} a combined use of frequency-dependent traveltime tomography (FDTT) and full waveform inversion (FWI) to estimate the near-surface seismic velocity that contains wavelength- and sub-wavelength-scale features. FDTT is fundamentally different from conventional ray-theory infinite-frequency traveltime tomography (<b>IFTT)</b> methods in the calculation of a frequency-dependent traveltime using wavelength-dependent velocity smoothing (WDVS). I justify the use of WDVS in FDTT for calculating a frequency-dependent traveltime by using forward modeling examples to show its frequency-dependent behaviors {{that are consistent with}} finite-frequency wave propagation. Compared to the conventional infinite-frequency traveltimes calculated based on ray-theory, the frequency-dependent traveltimes calculated using WDVS can better match that from synthetic seismographs. In the combined workflow of FDTT and FWI, FDTT provides a long-wavelength background seismic velocity model as the starting model, and then FWI introduces wavelength- and sub-wavelength-scale features that allow for direct geologic interpretation of the velocity models as is usually carried out in conventional imaging using seismic reflection data. I apply this workflow to seismic data generated by a near-surface realistic synthetic velocity model representing a geologic setting consisting of unconsolidated sediment overlying faulted bedrock, successfully imaging the key model features, a thin low-velocity layer in the sediments, a steep bedrock offset and a steeply dipping low-velocity fault zone. These structures are all at the wavelength-scale that are weakly presented by conventional ray-theory methods. I then apply this workflow to 2 D P- and SH-waves collected in 2011 at Rice campus with a known target consisting of a buried tunnel with concrete walls and a void space inside. FDTT inverted the P- and SH-wave picked traveltimes at 250 Hz to provide long-wavelength background velocity models as the starting models for FWI. FWI inverted 18 - 54 Hz P-wave data and 16 - 50 Hz SH-wave data to produce velocity models with sub-wavelength- and wavelength-scale features. The P- and SH-wave models image the top part of the tunnel at the correct location at a depth of 1. 6 m as a high-velocity anomaly. The P-wave models also image the air in the void space of the tunnel as a low-velocity anomaly. As a comparison, in both the realistic synthetic test and real data applications, conventional <b>IFTT</b> is also applied in a combined workflow with FWI. The comparisons of the inverted models show that both <b>IFTT</b> and FDTT models can serve as adequate starting models for FWI, but FDTT is favored over <b>IFTT</b> because: 1) The FDTT models better recover the magnitude of the velocity anomalies, and 2) The FDTT model serves as a better starting model for FWI, which results in a more accurate FWI velocity estimation with better recovery of the magnitude and location of the key features, particularly in the absence of usable low frequency data...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} investigation on the long-term {{behavior and the}} structure-property relation in high performance polymeric fibers. These fibers have wide applications in structural cable and ropes and reinforced composites. Therefore, the understanding of their structure-property relation and their behavior under external mechanical stress is very important. ^ The fatigue and creep behavior were studied. A general lifetime equation was derived to correlate the material lifetime with the applied stress level. The failure criterion of “critical strain” was identified. The failure mechanism was {{shown to be a}} deformation route. The fatigue lifetime was predicted from known material constants. Several material parameters were defined to characterize the fatigue and creep properties. The fatigue property is characterized by the fatigue strength and fatigue strength index; while the creep property is characterized by the creep strength and creep strength index. The fatigue strength index was used to show that fiber with a rigid chain structure, such as Kevlar®, Techanora ® and Vectran®, generally have better fatigue resistance than a flexible chain fiber, such as Spectra®. ^ Twisting was found to influence yarn properties. A model based on composite theory was developed to predict the change in the yarn modulus with the degree of twist. ^ The desire for nondestructive prediction of the residual lifetime of a used material initiated the efforts to find a signature of the stress and thermal history in Kevlar® fibers. To achieve this, a new testing methodology has been developed. An iso-strain force-temperature test (<b>IFTT)</b> was shown to yield quantitative information on the stress and thermal history as well as the information of relaxation and transitions in many materials. The <b>IFTT</b> behavior of a Kevlar® fiber maps well with its structure examined by X-ray diffraction. The <b>IFTT</b> was also used to screen the processing for property enhancement via post-treatment. ^ Different post-treatment routes have been investigated for Kevlar ® fiber. Tension, heat, hydrostatic pressure, and different media of water, mercury and silicon oil have been utilized to alter the materials. The evolution of its property and structure have been carefully examined. It is shown that the modulus of PPTA is determined by two structure parameters: misorientation and a paracrystalline parameter. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{meaning of}} a sound may {{influence}} its rating significantly. Therefore, a method was proposed, which removes the meaning of sound, keeping the loudness-time function the same. In essence, the sound is analyzed by FTT and, after spectral broadening, resynthesized by <b>IFTT.</b> Since {{it is impossible to}} remove the {{meaning of a}} sound, keeping all psychoacoustic magnitudes the same, variations are discussed for the sound produced by a noise immission of 20 min duration. For the comparison, loudness, sharpness, fluctuation strength, and roughness are considered as functions of time, and as cumulative distributions. Data for the original sound with meaning are compared to data for the neutralized sound without meaning. While the loudness-time functions of original and neutralized sound are the same, significant differences can occur with respect to roughness...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} procedure to fully characterize the thermal and elastic constants for orthotropic {{as well as}} transversely isotropic polymeric films and coatings. Linear elasticity theory was {{used to describe the}} response of the studied materials. All of the Young 2 ̆ 7 s moduli, shear moduli, Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratios, and the thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) of the materials were determined. The structure and properties of films or coatings being processed under different conditions were studied, and the relationship of process-structure-property was investigated to instruct the manufacturing of films and coatings with high quality. ^ Sequentially biaxially stretched PET films that were heat set at different temperatures were characterized in the first project. The compliance matrices of the two studied films were determined by special techniques such as vibrational holographic interferometry, pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) apparatus, high-pressure gas dilatometry, and torsion pendulum. The effects of heat treatments, including heat setting and annealing, on the calorimetric properties, the iso-strain force temperature test (<b>IFTT)</b> results, the thermal expansion and shrinkage behavior, and the structure and orientation of the molecules were also studied. ^ In the second project, a new epoxy based negative photoresist, SU 8, was investigated. The influence of three important processing parameters: the baking time, baking temperature, and UV exposure dose, on the thermal and mechanical properties of the resultant coatings were studied in detail, SU 8 coatings that were processed or post treated under ten different conditions by Hewlett-Packard Company were characterized. The residual stresses generated during processing and post treatments were measured by holography technique, and the moisture absorption of the coatings was also studied. ^ In the last project, the volume-pressure behavior of porous silica gels with different properties was studied using the PVT apparatus. Mercury as well as water was used as the confining liquid for the PVT measurements. The intrusion pressure, extrusion pressure, and the hysteresis between the pressurizing and depressurizing process were all obtained. Some porous polymeric materials, such as porous PS and SAN, were also studied. ...|$|E
