5|$|For {{the first}} decade after {{nationalisation}} services to Chesham continued much as before, although the unification of the mainline companies meant {{a wider variety of}} locomotives operating services on the branch. For two weeks from 13 October 1952 LT experimented with a three-car lightweight <b>diesel</b> <b>train</b> on the route, but the train used had difficulty negotiating the line's sharp bends and the branch reverted to steam operations.|$|E

25|$|The APT {{project had}} {{suffered}} repeated delays, and in 1970, the British Railways Board (BRB) {{decided that it}} was not sufficiently developed to be able to provide modernisation of the railways in the short term. Thus, at the instigation of Terry Miller, Chief Engineer (Traction & Rolling Stock), the Board authorised the development of a high-speed <b>diesel</b> <b>train</b> for short-term use until the APT was able to take over. An operational prototype of this train was to be built by 1972.|$|E
25|$|The first {{electric}} train ran on April 30, 1984, beginning at Brewster North. As additional new M3s {{were put into}} service that spring, electric service increased. On September 1, 1984, a new schedule was put out, and running times decreased by 18 minutes on peak hour trains. On September 10, 1984, super express service was inaugurated on the Harlem Line, with trains running non-stop between Katonah and Grand Central. The last <b>diesel</b> <b>train</b> left Brewster on November 2, 1984, marking {{the completion of the}} electrification project.|$|E
25|$|The two {{prototype}} power cars {{emerged from}} the works in June and August 1972 and were initially numbered 41001 and 41002, but after a short period the entire set, including the passenger coaches, became reclassified as a diesel-electric multiple unit: British Rail Class 252. The power cars were given the coaching stock numbers 43000 and 43001. After proving trials on the Eastern Region the prototype High Speed <b>Diesel</b> <b>Train</b> (HSDT) {{was transferred to the}} Western Region, where it was deployed on Paddington Bristol/Weston-super-Mare services.|$|E

25|$|The 1970s saw British Rail {{successfully}} introduce {{high speed}} <b>diesel</b> <b>train</b> services, {{as well as}} major resignalling projects designed to increase operational efficiency. In 1976, the InterCity 125 High Speed Train (HST) was introduced on some services and the InterCity brand was adopted. This created an increase in passengers using the railways and improved British Rail's finances. British Rail also started development of the world's first tilting train â€“ the Advanced Passenger Train (APT). However, lack of money, political pressure and {{the launch of the}} prototype into passenger service before technical problems were fully overcome lead to the project being cancelled in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Auckland's network {{consists}} of four lines: Southern, Eastern, Western and Onehunga. All services on these lines are provided by electric trains, the conversion from diesel being completed {{by the end of}} 2015 {{with the exception of the}} non-electrified section of track between Papakura and Pukekohe, where a <b>diesel</b> <b>train</b> shuttle service operates. For nine years Tranz Metro also operated the suburban passenger services in Auckland, however in mid-2004 Connex (later Veolia, now Transdev) won the contract to run them. In recent years the mothballed Onehunga Branch was reopened (2010) and a new line was built (Manukau Branch, opened April 2012). Recent major projects include electrification of the Auckland suburban network and the building of the City Rail Link. Most Auckland rolling stock is owned by Auckland Transport (AT) who fund all services.|$|E
25|$|Ivy City began a {{significant}} decline in 1953. American railroads, which until this time had used coal-fueled locomotives, began switching to diesel fuel or using overhead electrical wires for powering engines. By {{the end of}} the year, almost no coal-fed locomotives were using the Ivy City rail yard. Although coal-fueled engines required frequent refueling, a <b>diesel</b> <b>train</b> could go for as many as three days without needing more diesel fuel. Steam-powered locomotives required almost daily tune-up and repair, but diesel-fueled engines rarely did. Significant layoffs at the Ivy City Yard occurred, deeply affecting Ivy City itself were many of these workers lived. The eastern roundhouse and a number of tracks were demolished in early 1954, and by 1956 the coal wharf and ash pits were also gone. As the railroad laid off workers, Ivy City also declined as a neighborhood.|$|E

25|$|A {{long sought}} {{connection}} of train service between the Lackawanna Railroad's Montclair Branch and the Erie Railroad's New York and Greenwood Lake Railroad, which serviced five other stations in Montclair was first proposed in 1929 by the Regional Plan Association. However, the Great Depression shelved any plans {{to connect the}} lines. The plan continued to wane for several years until in 1963, when the old Boonton Branch was reconfigured at Mountain View in Wayne, New Jersey to the New York and Greenwood Lake, when revival plans returned. However, the connection {{continued to be a}} quiet subject until the late 1980s, when New Jersey Transit revived the proposal. A deal was struck with the township of Montclair in 1998, with a one track connection used for only <b>diesel</b> <b>train</b> sets. However, this proposal was changed into a double track connection with overhead electric catenary wires. Construction on the Montclair Connection began one year later and was completed on September 30, 2002.|$|E
500|$|During {{the album}} production, Townshend made many field {{recordings}} with a portable reel-to-reel recorder. These included waves washing on a Cornish beach and the doppler whistle of a <b>diesel</b> <b>train</b> recorded near Townshend's house at Goring-on-Thames. The ending of [...] "The Dirty Jobs" [...] includes a musical excerpt from a brass band performance of The Thunderer by John Philip Sousa, which Nevison recorded in Regent's Park.
