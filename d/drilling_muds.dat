30|$|As MPT system signals {{propagate}} {{through the}} <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> along the borehole, signals are attenuated and dispersed. This {{is caused by}} underbalanced <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> which results into viscous dissipation and frictional energy loss at the borehole walls (Harrell et al. 2000). To minimize reservoir damage, the <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> pressure is kept high that exceeds the hydrostatic pressure and nitrogen gas is used to reduce mud density. The effect increases the <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> compressibility hence reducing mud bulk modulus and mud pulse propagation velocity in the drilling fluid (Lin et al. 2013). Changes in <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> compressibility may result into serious earth formation damage which strongly affects {{the shape of the}} signal pulses and complicates the decoding process. Factors influencing mud pulse signal attenuation include the borehole depth, <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> type, number of joints in the drill string, drillstring inner diameter and signal operating frequency (Brooks 2015). Attenuation impacts may not be constant across the range of frequency components, lower frequency components are subject to less attenuation than higher frequencies (Klotz et al. 2008 c). Devising good control of the various noise sources in 1 – 20 Hz frequency band, it is advantageous to transmit MPT data at the lowest possible frequency to minimize the signal attenuation impacts. In high data rate exploration and drilling operation applications, the effect of signal attenuation is not the major burden but rather the various noise sources and their distribution across the available channel transmission band.|$|R

The smaller particles of <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> are able to break through into the larger void spaces in the formation which lead to lost circulation. Hence, fibrous materials in apple skin being identified to be used as lost circulation material (LCM) in <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> to prevent loss of circulation.

As for API filter press test, the additions of apple skin in mud reduced the mud filtrate and increase the mud cake formation thickness. Apple skin fibers have a potential to be used as LCM in <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> due to the ability in reducing the mud filtrate and increasing the mud cake thickness that will prevents mud lost circulation problem to happen...|$|R
