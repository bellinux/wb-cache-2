The group found that the <b>housing</b> <b>conditions</b> at the time constituted a serious menace to public health in New York since some 400,000 persons were directly affected by the scarcity of affordable dwellings and the poor quality of the existing ones.

The decline of the Clydeside shipbuilding industry in the 1950s meant the demand for iron finally collapsed. A legacy of 'devastating' unemployment, appalling <b>housing</b> <b>conditions</b> and some of the worst overcrowding in Scotland left its stamp on the Coatbridge of the early 1930s.

Nevertheless, Bessie, who had been appalled by the <b>housing</b> <b>conditions</b> in the ward, helped to instigate a slum clearance campaign which slowly brought improvements. As {{a member of the}} council's Port Sanitary and Hospitals Committee, which controlled all the city's hospitals and residential homes for the elderly, Bessie discovered that the hospitals were generally verminous, drably decorated and poorly ventilated, with inadequate cooking facilities. Patients' record-keeping systems were rudimentary, with little or no communication between hospitals. She became involved in the reform, reorganisation and modernisation of many of the city's health facilities, particularly those related to mothers and children. From 1934 she was chairman of the Maternity and Child Welfare subcommittee, and in June 1936 worked with other women's groups to organise a national conference on maternity and child welfare issues.|$|E

40|$|Social {{capital is}} {{described}} as the concept of social network or social interaction among residents in a neighborhood. In times past, physical environment factors enhancing the level of social capital were main issues to researchers: land-use type and neighborhood design. However, based on various benefits gained from social capital theory, it is needed to study {{about the influence of}} social capital. Thus, the impact of social capital on the physical urban environment is investigated in this dissertation research in order to make more livable, healthier, and more active community. Most researches dealing with social capital and <b>housing</b> <b>condition</b> have not been empirically tested comprehensively because {{there is a lack of}} consensus about the measurement of social capital. And only structural housing parts were dealt with in their research. In this dissertation, however, the level of social capital is measured through public data sources not household surveys, such as U. S. Census, the City of Lincoln, Lincoln Police Department, etc. Non-structural housing parts related to dwelling environment are also discussed to measure overall <b>housing</b> <b>condition.</b> ^ Main focus in this dissertation research is to investigate whether the condition of dwelling structure and environment of neighborhoods with a high level of social capital will be better than the condition of dwelling structure and environment of neighborhoods with a low level of social capital. Also, social capital indices closely associated with <b>housing</b> <b>condition</b> are identified. ^ According to the results of statistical analysis, there is some impact of social capital on the condition of dwelling structure and environment while controlling other neighborhood characteristics. Especially, structural <b>housing</b> <b>condition</b> and <b>housing</b> exterior <b>condition</b> are affected by the level of social capital significantly. And some social capital indices such as social mobility, marriage rate, own children under 18 years old, homeownership rate, voter turnout, and crime incidence are significant to explain variations of dependent variables 2 ̆ 7 values. ...|$|R

The influences of cohabitation with a male or female conspecific, {{and the birth of}} offspring, on the physiological and endocrine responses to chronic variable stress were studied in the monogamous and biparental California mouse (Peromyscus californicus). Adult male California mice were housed either with a male cage mate (virgin males, VM), a female cage mate (pair-bonded males, PBM), or a female cage mate and their first newborn litter (new fathers, NF). VM, PBM and NF underwent a 7 -day chronic variable stress paradigm (CVS, three stressors per day at semi-random times, n= 7 - 8 per <b>housing</b> <b>condition).</b> Compared to control males (CON, n= 6 - 7 per <b>housing</b> <b>condition),</b> CVS caused loss of body mass, increased basal plasma corticosterone concentrations, and increased basal expression of arginine vasopressin (AVP) mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). These effects were independent of <b>housing</b> <b>condition.</b> Neither CVS nor <b>housing</b> <b>condition</b> altered novel-stressor-induced corticosterone release, spleen or testis mass, or basal expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA in the PVN. Although CVS appeared to increase adrenal mass and reduce thymus mass specifically in NF, these effects were explained by the lower adrenal mass and higher thymus mass of NF compared to PBM and VM under control conditions. These results suggest that neither engaging in a pair bond nor becoming a father attenuates typical responses to CVS, but that fatherhood may provide a buffer against transient mild stressors (i. e., weighing and blood sampling in the control groups) in this monogamous and biparental rodent. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of social housing manipulations on body weight, corticosterone levels, and performance of T-maze alternation in male CD- 1 mice. Males that adopted a dominant social rank were heavier than those that adopted a subordinate social rank. Dominant males also had lower corticosterone concentrations than the subordinates. However, there was little to suggest that these physiological indicators of social rank were moderated by <b>housing</b> <b>condition.</b> Indeed, statistical analysis confirmed that the difference in body weights was evident before males were socially housed. The mice showed high levels of spatial alternation on the T-maze from the start of testing so performance accuracy was high. Neither social rank nor <b>housing</b> <b>condition</b> had any clear categorical effect on T-maze performance. However, performance did fluctuate over successive blocks of testing and there was a negative association between accuracy on the T-maze and corticosterone levels (consistent with performance impairment because of elevated corticosterone). Therefore, under present conditions, individual differences in corticosterone were a better predictor of T-maze performance than were social rank or <b>housing</b> <b>condition.</b> The {{results of the present study}} lend further support to the proposition that corticosterone levels measured non-invasively in urine may be used to predict diverse welfare outcomes for laboratory mice, from body weight to cognitive performance. Moreover, intrinsic physiological parameters rather than external influences such as social housing may have more influence on mouse behaviour...|$|R
