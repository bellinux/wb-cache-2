Additionally, emphasis was placed on the writing and atmosphere to compensate for the film's small $4.5 million budget.|$|E

5|$|As {{construction}} {{of schools and}} <b>hiring</b> <b>of</b> teachers continued in Ravalomanana's second term, additional measures were adopted to improve education quality, including a shift to Malagasy as the language of instruction in grades one to five, expansion of primary schools to house grades six and seven for greater access to lower secondary schooling and {{an overhaul of the}} national curriculum, which had been modified piecemeal since independence from France in 1960. In the Constitution of 2007, English was added to Malagasy and French as an official language, in reflection of Ravalomanana's goal to increase Madagascar's participation in the global market.|$|E

5|$|Deprived of a {{rationale}} for existence by the national monument's establishment, Islandia languished. The <b>hiring</b> <b>of</b> a police chief in 1989 prompted questions from the National Park Service to the Dade County state attorney's office, headed by Janet Reno. In 1990 Reno's office determined after investigation {{that all of the}} town's elections were invalid, since the elections were restricted only to landowners, not residents. The town was finally abolished by the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners in March 2012.|$|E

Although certain professional services could also be hired, high-standard intellectual activities belonging to the liberal arts could not be the object of locatio conductio. The <b>hire</b> <b>of</b> services gave rise to a synallagmatic bonae fidei obligation. The wage labourer was obliged to work according to the instructions of the employer and with a due standard of care. He was liable for culpa levis.
