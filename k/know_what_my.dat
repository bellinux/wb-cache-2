2500|$|The novel {{caused an}} uproar in the {{community}} it portrayed; it {{was taken off the}} shelves of the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookstore — New York's only gay bookstore - and Kramer was banned from the grocery store near his home on Fire Island. Reviewers found it difficult to believe that Kramer's accounts of gay relationships were accurate; both the gay and mainstream press panned the book. On the reception of the novel Kramer says, [...] "The straight world thought I was repulsive, and the gay world treated me like a traitor. People would literally turn their back when I walked by. You <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> real crime was? I put the truth in writing. That's what I do: I have told the fucking truth to everyone I have ever met." [...] Faggots, however, became one of the best-selling gay novels of all time. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126174240/http://www.glbthistorymonth.com/glbthistorymonth/bio.cfm?LeaderID=25 |archivedate=November 26, 2006 }} ...|$|E

[...] Evert and Ruzici had many exchanges that lasted about 20 to 30 shots, which went back-and-forth between deuce and {{advantage}} {{for over an}} hour, but most of those exchanges Evert won {{just by looking at}} the scoring line 6 games to love in the first set and two games to love to start the second set. [...] After a weird line call, Evert lost her serve for the first-time in the match in the third game of the second set, which she would go on to drop the next subsequent two games in order to fall behind 2 games to 3. [...] Evert would not let this get to her, and would win the next four games to with her fourth French crown, which Evert is noted to have said [...] "at the start of this year.

2500|$|How do I {{write in}} the name of these three? Caeiro, through sheer and {{unexpected}} inspiration, without knowing or even suspecting that I’m going to write in his name. Ricardo Reis, after an abstract meditation, which suddenly takes concrete shape in an ode. Campos, when I feel a sudden impulse to write and don’t <b>know</b> <b>what.</b> (<b>My</b> semi-heteronym Bernardo Soares, who in many ways resembles Álvaro de Campos, always appears when I'm sleepy or drowsy, so that my qualities of inhibition and rational thought are suspended; his prose is an endless reverie. He’s a semi-heteronym because his personality, although not my own, doesn’t differ from my own but is a mere mutilation of it. He’s me without my rationalism and emotions. His prose is the same as mine, except for certain formal restraint that reason imposes on my own writing, and his Portuguese is exactly the same – whereas Caeiro writes bad Portuguese, Campos writes it reasonably well but with mistakes such as [...] "me myself" [...] instead of [...] "I myself", etc.., and Reis writes better than I, but with a purism I find excessive...) ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And without looking back, {{he got out of the}} car and went through that door.|$|E
