25|$|Fungal {{immunomodulatory}} proteins (FIPs) are bioactive ingredients within genera Ganoderma {{that have}} immune building properties. FIPs stimulate different cells and cellular components that enable immune response. Some of the molecules and cells that FIPs influence include T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, and regulation of human monocyte DCs. Improved function of these cells will promote cytokine expression such as IL2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma which will support lymphocyte proliferation, immune cell initiation, and tumor inhibiting factors. <b>Immunostimulation</b> from FIPs could cause increased expression of costimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) which help {{to create a}} pathway for immune response to take place.|$|E

50|$|Postweaning {{multisystemic}} {{wasting syndrome}} ("PMWS") {{is the classic}} PCVD entity, caused by PCV-2. PCV-2 has a near universal distribution - present in most pig herds. In contrast, PMWS is more sporadic in its distribution. Experimental induction of PMWS has not been achieved by PCV-2 infection alone, using infectious DNA clones of the virus or a pure form of PCV-2 derived from infectious DNA clones. Therefore, {{it is assumed that}} PMWS is a multifactorial disease. PCV-2 is necessary but not sufficient for the development of PMWS. However, viral infection by itself tends to cause only mild disease, and co-factors such as other infections or <b>immunostimulation</b> seem necessary for development of severe disease.1 For example, concurrent infection with porcine parvovirus or PRRS virus, or <b>immunostimulation</b> lead to increased replication of PCV-2 and more severe disease in PCV-2-infected pigs.

50|$|Etiocholanolone, {{also known}} as 5β-androsterone, as well as 3α-hydroxy-5β-androstan-17-one or etiocholan-3α-ol-17-one, is an etiocholane (5β-androstane) steroid {{as well as an}} {{endogenous}} 17-ketosteroid that is produced from the metabolism of testosterone. It causes fever, <b>immunostimulation,</b> and leukocytosis, and is used to evaluate adrenal cortex function, bone marrow performance, and in neoplastic disease to stimulate the immune system. Etiocholanolone is also known to be an inhibitory androstane neurosteroid, acting as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, and possesses anticonvulsant effects. The unnatural enantiomer of etiocholanolone is more potent as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors and as an anticonvulsant than the natural form.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} commercially {{available}} immunologic adjuvants. Selection of specific adjuvants or types varies depending upon {{whether they are}} to be used for research and antibody production or in vaccine development. Adjuvants for vaccine use only need to produce protective antibodies and good systemic memory while those for antiserum production need to rapidly induce high titer, high avidity antibodies. No single adjuvant is ideal for all purposes and all have advantages and disadvantages. Adjuvant use generally is accompanied by undesirable side effects of varying severity and duration.

50|$|Beta-glucans immunomodulate by {{stimulating}} dectin-1 {{to trigger}} monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. In 2002, Wei et al. demonstrated that glucans directly stimulate human fibroblasts. Low molecular weight oat beta glucan increased macrophage proliferation and cytotoxicity to cancer cells while leaving healthy tissue intact. This effect also increased significantly with continued application over time. The beta-glucan further significantly reduced human melanoma and human epidermoid carcinoma, without toxic effects to human tissue, keratinocytes, or macrophages. Through <b>immunostimulation</b> {{they can also}} serve a preventative role against tumours. But beta-glucan's immunomodulatory properties are heavily dependent {{on the degree of}} branching and molecular size. For instance, cancer-fighting properties have been demonstrated in fungi and yeast beta-glucans, and more recently in low molecular weight oat beta-glucans, but high molecular weight oat beta-glucans are hindered by their high viscosity.|$|E
50|$|Although this {{research}} demonstrated a potential RNAi therapy using modified siRNA, the 90% reduction in HBV DNA in rodents {{resulted from a}} 30 mg/kg dosage with frequent administration. Because {{this is not a}} viable dosing regime, this same group looked at the effects of encapsulating the siRNA in a PEGylated lipid bilayer, or SNALP. Specifically, the lipid bilayer facilitates uptake into the cell and subsequent release from the endosome, the PEGylated outer layer providing stability during formulation due to the resulting hydrophilicity of the exterior. According to this 2005 study, researchers obtained 90% reduction in HBV DNA with a 3 mg/kg/day dose of siRNA for three days, a dose substantially lower than the earlier study. In addition, in contrast to unmodified or modified and non-encapsulated siRNA, administration of SNALP-delivered siRNA resulted in no detectable levels of interferons, such as IFN-a, or inflammatory cytokines associated with <b>immunostimulation.</b> Even so, researchers acknowledged that more work was necessary in order to reach a feasible dose and dosing regime.|$|E

50|$|Several rasayana herbs {{have been}} tested for adaptogenic properties:The whole, aqueous, {{standardized}} extracts of selected plants (Tinospora cordifolia, Asparagus racemosus, Emblica officinalis, Withmania somnifera, Piper longum and Terminalia chebula) were administered orally to experimental animals, in a dose extrapolated from the human dose, following which they were exposed {{to a variety of}} biological, physical and chemical stressors. These plants were found to offer protection against these stressors, as judged by using markers of stress responses and objective parameters for stress manifestations. Using a model of cisplatin induced alterations in gastrointestinal motility, the ability of these plants to exert a normalizing effect, irrespective of direction of pathological change was tested.... All the plant drugs were found to be safe in both acute and subacute toxicity studies. Studies on the mechanisms of action of the plants revealed that they all produced <b>immunostimulation.</b> The protection offered by Tinospora cordifolia against stress induced gastric mucosal damage was lost if macrophage activity was blocked. Emblica officinalis strengthened the defence mechanisms against free radical damage induced during stress. The effect of Emblica officinalis appeared to depend on the ability of target tissues to synthesize prostaglandins. Recent data obtained with Tinospora cordifolia have led researchers to suggest that it may induce genotypic adaptation, further opening the arena for more research and experimentation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Tumor {{progression}} In many (perhaps in all) tumor systems, {{a malignant}} cancer is {{preceded by a}} benign lesion. Most benign lesions do not transform to malignancy and many regress. The final transformative step to malignancy differs from the preceding steps in, among other things, that it often occurs {{in the absence of}} the original carcinogenic stimulus. Mechanism of <b>immunostimulation</b> Relatively low titers of specific immune reactants are known to stimulate, but cell-to-cell or cell-to-matrix interactions appear to be major inhibitors of tumor-growth. Therefore, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the mechanism of <b>immunostimulation</b> may be an interference with cell-to-cell or cell-to-matrix communication by a sub-lethal immune-reaction. Discussion While the above hypothesis remains unproven, some evidence suggests that immunity may have a major facilitating effect on tumor growth especially at the time of malignant transformation. There is even some evidence suggesting that transformation in vivo may seldom occur in the absence of <b>immunostimulation</b> of the premalignant lesion. Positive selection by the immune reaction may be the reason that tumors are immunogenic. </p...|$|E

However, reduced {{efficacy}} of many treatments and need for integrated sea lice management plans require innovative strategies. Resistance to emamectin benzoate (EMB), a major sea lice parasiticide, has been linked with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression. We hypothesized that host <b>immunostimulation</b> would complement EMB treatment outcome. Lepeophtheirus salmonis-infected Atlantic salmon were fed immunostimulatory or control feeds. Sea lice were collected for 24 -h EMB bioassays 1 and 2 weeks prior to commencement of EMB treatment of the fish. Two weeks after cessation of immunostimulant-treated feed, EMB was administered at 150 μg kg(- 1) fish biomass for 7 days. The bioassay revealed stage, gender and immunostimulant-related differences in EMB EC(50). Sea lice attached to salmon {{with a history of}} <b>immunostimulation</b> exhibited significantly greater survival than those on control feeds, despite similar levels of EMB in host tissues. Lepeophtheirus salmonis from salmon with a history of <b>immunostimulation</b> also exhibited higher P-gp mRNA expression as well as greater survivability compared to controls.

Type 2 porcine circovirus (PCV 2) {{has been associated}} with this syndrome although other factors are required in association with this virus for PMWS expression. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether general <b>immunostimulation</b> (injections of keyhole limpet hemocyanin emulsified in incomplete Freund adjuvant and of thioglycollate medium) could strengthen the severity of PMWS in six-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) piglets transfected with pure tandem-cloned PCV 2 DNA by the intramuscular route. Non-immunostimulated piglets transfected with the viral clone did not present clinical signs but only mild pathological microlesions characteristic of PMWS. These piglets seroconverted and high viral genome loads and infectious titers were detected in the lymphoid organs at the end of the trial. Mild-to-moderate forms of PMWS were generally observed in the immunostimulated transfected piglets, as well as one severe form for a piglet (8003) which died. These piglets with mild-to-moderate forms had higher DNA loads than the transfected-only animals. Thus, viral replication was enhanced by <b>immunostimulation.</b> This is the first time that clinical PMWS has been reported in an SPF immunostimulated piglet infected with a pure inoculum consisting of tandem-cloned PCV 2 DNA.

We found that any single accelerating factor can enhance the underlying autoimmune diseases in genetically predisposed mice, but simultaneous stimulation by multiple accelerating factors is required to induce pathogenic autoimmune responses in immunologically normal mice.

40|$|Abstract Background Social insects, such as honey bees, use molecular, {{physiological}} and behavioral responses to combat pathogens and parasites. The honey bee genome contains {{all of the}} canonical insect immune response pathways, and several {{studies have demonstrated that}} pathogens can activate expression of immune effectors. Honey bees also use behavioral responses, termed social immunity, to collectively defend their hives from pathogens and parasites. These responses include hygienic behavior (where workers remove diseased brood) and allo-grooming (where workers remove ectoparasites from nestmates). We have previously demonstrated that <b>immunostimulation</b> causes changes in the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of workers, which results in altered worker-worker social interactions. Thus, cuticular hydrocarbons may enable workers to identify sick nestmates, and adjust their behavior in response. Here, we test the specificity of behavioral, chemical and genomic responses to <b>immunostimulation</b> by challenging workers with a panel of different immune stimulants (saline, Sephadex beads and Gram-negative bacteria E. coli). Results While only bacteria-injected bees elicited altered behavioral responses from healthy nestmates compared to controls, all treatments resulted in significant changes in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. <b>Immunostimulation</b> caused significant changes in expression of hundreds of genes, the majority of which have not been identified as members of the canonical immune response pathways. Furthermore, several new candidate genes that {{may play a role in}} cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis were identified. Effects of immune challenge expression of several genes involved in immune response, cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis, and the Notch signaling pathway were confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR. Finally, we identified common genes regulated by pathogen challenge in honey bees and other insects. Conclusions These results demonstrate that honey bee genomic responses to <b>immunostimulation</b> are substantially broader than the previously identified canonical immune response pathways, and may mediate the behavioral changes associated with social immunity by orchestrating changes in chemical signaling. These studies lay the groundwork for future research into the genomic responses of honey bees to native honey bee parasites and pathogens. </p...|$|E

We conducted a longitudinal study of one squatter and one middle-class group (n 86, 3 – 18 month olds) to assess these relationships in Nepal. Growth, mucosal damage index (MDI; urinary lactose:creatinine ratio adjusted for body weight), morbidity reports, and blood concentrations of albumin, α- 1 -acid glycoprotein, IgG and Hb, were recorded monthly. Growth status worsened dramatically from 6 to 18 months, with squatters more stunted (height-for-age Z-score (HAZ), P < 0 · 001) and underweight (weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ), P = 0 · 009) than middle class. IgG increased with age, was elevated in squatter children, and negatively related to WAZ (P = 0 · 034).
