The emergency relief effort {{was led by}} U.S. Ambassador Randall L. Tobias, former CEO of Eli Lilly and Global AIDS Coordinator at the Department of State. At {{the time of the}} speech, $9 billion was earmarked for new programs in AIDS relief for the 15 countries most affected by HIV/AIDS, another $5 billion for continuing support of AIDS relief in 100 countries where the U.S. already had bilateral programs established, and an additional $1 billion towards the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. This budget represented more money contributed to fight AIDS globally than all other donor countries combined.|$|E

The experts, led by Anthony S. Fauci, recommended that the U.S. focus on providing antiretroviral drugs to developing nations in Africa and the Caribbean. In his State of the Union message in January 2003, President Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global <b>emergency</b> <b>AIDS</b> relief, the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief. With the approval of Congress, Bush committed $15 billion to this effort, which represented a huge increase compared to funding under previous administrations. Near the end of his presidency, Bush signed a re-authorization of the program that doubled its funding. By 2012, the PEPFAR program provided antiretroviral drugs for over 4.5 million people.|$|E

40|$|Summary We use an {{original}} data set covering 270 natural disasters {{to analyze the}} determinants of international <b>emergency</b> <b>aid.</b> Although humanitarian need {{appears to be a}} major determinant of emergency relief payments, our results suggest that political and strategic factors {{play a crucial role in}} <b>emergency</b> <b>aid</b> allocation as well. On average, donor governments favor smaller, geographically closer and oil exporting countries, and display significant biases in favor of politically less aligned countries as well as toward their former colonies. We also test and reject the independence of donors' aid decisions, finding strong evidence for bandwagon effects in humanitarian assistance. foreign <b>aid</b> natural disasters <b>emergency</b> <b>aid</b> global selected countries...|$|R

40|$|The use of multisource {{essential}} drugs widely {{contributes to}} the accessibility to health care for populations in difficulties in developing countries or in case of <b>emergency</b> <b>aids.</b> The issue of bioavailability questions the simplistic theories about drugs interchangeability. Bioequivalence studies {{must be carried out}} to ensure the therapeutic equivalence of two pharmaceutic equivalent drugs. However, by looking at drugs circulation around the world, one realizes that these studies are not systematically carried out. National regulations set the conditions for the execution of bioequivalence studies but there is no consensus between the various European States. The subsequent deregulation generates even more confusion in the supply of drugs to developing countries. This study consisted first of reviewing a few national regulations and second of considering, on a case by case basis, possible exemptions from bioequivalence studies for active ingredients...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{estimates}} {{a health}} production function for Sub-Saharan Africa {{based on the}} Grossman (1972) theoretical model that treats social, economic, and environmental factors as inputs of the production system. In estimating this function, socioeconomic and environmental factors such as income per capita, illiteracy rate, food availability, ratio of health expenditure to GDP, urbanization rate, and carbon dioxide emission per worker are specified as determinants of health status, proxied by life expectancy at birth. The parameters of the function are estimated by a method of one-way and two-way panel data analyses. The results obtained from two-way random effect model suggest that an increase in income per capita, a decrease in illiteracy rate, an increase in food availability are well associated with improvement in life expectancy at birth. Overall results suggest that a health policy, which may focus on the provision of health, services, family planning programs, and <b>emergency</b> <b>aids</b> {{to the exclusion of}} other socioeconomic aspects may do little in efforts directed toward improving the current health status of the region.

The investigator had visited the house and found that the baby had had no attention for five hours, there being no one to give it even a drink of water. The investigator called for a nurse and we had none available. There are any number of such cases in the city and we are not getting volunteers simply because the public has not realized the vital need for service. ”’• The Red Cross worker, in addition to volunteers and nurses, also calls for more cars; the Red Cross has supplies, but no one to take them outNewspaper article...|$|E
