5|$|After Combat Rock, the Clash {{began to}} disintegrate. Headon {{was asked to}} leave the band just before the album's release because heroin {{addiction}} was damaging his health and drumming.

5|$|During the four-day offense of Vahan, {{his troops}} {{had failed to}} achieve any {{breakthrough}} and had suffered heavy casualties, especially during the mobile guard's flanking counterattacks. Early on 19 August 636, the fifth day of the battle, Vahan sent an emissary to the Muslim camp for a truce <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> days so that fresh negotiations could be held.

After this failure, the Mongols retreated and Béla IV rewarded the Croatian towns and nobility. Only the city of Split did not help Béla IV in his escape.|$|E

5|$|Ifs {{new owner}} was Robert Guinn, of Galaxy Publishing. The change of {{ownership}} was abrupt {{and led to a}} delay in publication, with the first issue under new editorship not appearing until July 1959. The editor was Horace Gold, who was also the editor of Galaxy Science Fiction; Galaxy had gone from a monthly to a bimonthly schedule at the start of 1959, and If and Galaxy appeared in alternate months <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> years. In a 1975 retrospective article, Gold commented that his policy with If was to experiment, using new writers who had not yet established themselves. In the judgement of science-fiction historian Mike Ashley, the effect was that If became the weaker of the two magazines, printing stories that were of lower quality than those Gold selected for Galaxy.|$|E
