25|$|Infections with {{intestinal}} helminths (worms) - {{approximately two}} billion people {{are infected with}} soil-transmitted helminths worldwide; they are transmitted by eggs present in <b>human</b> <b>faeces</b> which in turn contaminate soil in areas where sanitation is poor.|$|E
25|$|On 1 December, {{there was}} more torrential rain in the west, with {{drinking}} water supplies to 6,000 buildings in Galway reported to have been contaminated by <b>human</b> <b>faeces</b> and water undrinkable in more than 500 homes in Clare and Limerick.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{improved}} access to sanitation {{which includes the}} use of properly functioning and clean toilets by all community members as one important aspect. Handwashing with soap may be protective; however, {{there is no evidence}} it affects the severity of disease. Eliminating the use of untreated <b>human</b> <b>faeces</b> as fertilizer is also important.|$|E
25|$|In animals, intravital {{diagnosis}} is based predominantly on faeces examinations and immunological methods. However, clinical signs, biochemical and haematological profile, season, climate conditions, epidemiology situation, and examinations of snails must be considered. Similarly to <b>humans,</b> <b>faeces</b> examinations are not reliable. Moreover, the fluke eggs are detectable in faeces 8–12 weeks post-infection. In {{spite of that}} fact, faecal examination is still the only used diagnostic tool in some countries. While coprological diagnosis of fasciolosis is possible from 8- to 12-week post-infection (WPI), F. hepatica specific-antibodies are recognized using ELISA or Western blot after 2-4 week post-infection. Therefore, these methods provide early detection of the infection.|$|R
40|$|Houseflies {{have been}} {{proposed}} to be a reservoir and vector for Helicobacter pylori. We assessed the effect of insecticide spraying in villages in The Gambia on H. pylori infection in young children. Effective control of flies did not prevent infection with H. pylori. I nfection with Helicobacter pylori is {{a major cause of}} gastrointestinal disease but the precise mode(s) of trans-mission are unknown. There is no confirmed environ-mental reservoir other than man, suggesting that transmission is from person to person and faecal-oral, oral-oral, and gastro-oral routes have been implicated. 1 H. pylori infection is common in young children living in poor socioeconomic circumstances.

25|$|Prevention {{and control}} {{measures}} to prevent soil-transmitted helminthiasis are the following: availability {{of clean water}} for personal and domestic uses, improved access to sanitation which includes the use of properly functioning and clean toilets by all community members, education on personal hygiene such as hand washing and hygienic and safe food preparation; eliminating the use of untreated <b>human</b> <b>faeces</b> as fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{improper}} {{disposal of}} human {{waste in the}} mountain environment there is high risk of health hazards. <b>Human</b> <b>faeces</b> are very dangerous; they contain over 100 bacteria, protozoans and viruses that, without a specialised recycling process, {{pose a threat to}} both animals and human beings. Only boiled or chemically treated water is accepted for drinking. Decent changes have appeared in recent years–management bodies care more about human waste disposal. The authorities in mountain regions are gradually exchanging the old, leaking toilets for newer, eco–friendly models.|$|E
500|$|The {{purchase}} {{was part}} of the corporation's ultimately unsuccessful plan to retain the pail closet system (now superseded by the water closet), and followed a public scandal created by the daily dumping of 30–60tons of <b>human</b> <b>faeces</b> into the Medlock and Irwell rivers, at Holt Town sewage works. [...] It paid about £38,000 (£ as of [...] ), for the site, but the bog's depth, between [...] deep pushed the total development cost to almost £94,000 (£ as of [...] ).

500|$|Following {{the successes}} seen in various {{northern}} towns, about 7,000 pail closets {{were introduced in}} 1871 in Leicester, where the implementation of water closets had been hindered by the refusal of the water company to provide adequate supplies. [...] The use of pail closets reduced the demand placed upon the area's inadequate sewerage system, but the town suffered with difficulties in the collection and treatment of the night soil. [...] Initially, night soil was collected by contractors, but after 1873 the local authority became responsible. [...] The authority found dealing with the night soil an expensive and difficult business and, following legal proceedings against the corporation in 1878, transport of night soil was transferred from the railway system to canal barges. [...] This, however, led to complaints that the canal was being polluted. [...] In 1886, the authority found that the River Soar was badly polluted by sewage and so they built a sewage farm at Beaumont Leys. [...] By {{the end of the}} 19th century, this and {{the construction of a new}} sewer system enabled all pail closets to be phased out and replaced by water closets. [...] In Manchester, faced with phenomenal population growth, the council attempted to retain the pail closet system, but following the exposure of the dumping of [...] of <b>human</b> <b>faeces</b> into the Medlock and Irwell rivers at their Holt Town sewage works, the council was forced to change their plans. [...] Originally they had intended to build incinerators, but public objections to the dumping of waste into rivers forced the council instead to purchase Carrington Moss in 1886, and Chat Moss in 1895, which were both developed as refuse disposal sites. [...] But by the 1930s neither site was still receiving night soil, the water closet having replaced dry conservancy in Manchester.|$|E

2500|$|Sloths are {{classified}} as folivores, as {{the bulk of their}} diets consist of buds, tender shoots, and leaves, mainly of Cecropia trees. Some two-toed sloths have been documented as eating insects, small reptiles, and birds as a small supplement to their diets. Linnaeus's two-toed sloth has recently been documented eating <b>human</b> <b>faeces</b> from open latrines. They have made extraordinary adaptations to an arboreal browsing lifestyle. Leaves, their main food source, provide very little energy or nutrients, and do not digest easily. Sloths, therefore, have large, specialized, slow-acting stomachs with multiple compartments in which symbiotic bacteria break down the tough leaves. Sloths have the unique ability to protrude their tongues from their mouths , an ability that is useful for collecting leaves just out of reach. [...] As much as two-thirds of a well-fed sloth's body weight consists of the contents of its stomach, and the digestive process can take a month or more to complete.|$|E

However, some of these microorganisms were reported to be opportunistic pathogens of humans and were isolated from human clinical specimens of an outbreak of food poisoning. For instance, E. coli are commonly used as surrogate indicator, whose presence in food generally indicates direct and indirect contamination with <b>human</b> or animal <b>faeces</b> [7].|$|R
50|$|A CBS system {{includes}} a toilet (usually portable) with a removable container which is routinely exchanged for an empty container {{when it is}} full. The toilet design, which may incorporate the use of chemicals and a biodegradable plastic film, {{in the case of}} Loowatt, eliminates <b>human</b> contact with <b>faeces</b> and reduces odor and insects. All infrastructure associated with a CBS system is typically situated above ground, thereby reducing both construction costs  and vulnerability to flooding. Excreta-filled containers are sealed and transported to a designated disposal or composting site. Water needs are limited to the amount required for anal cleansing and hand washing.|$|R

Normally human feces are semisolid, with a mucus coating. Small pieces of harder, less moist feces can sometimes be seen impacted on the distal (leading) end. This is a normal occurrence when a prior bowel movement is incomplete, and feces are returned from the rectum to the intestine, where water is absorbed.|$|R

40|$|Outbreaks {{of human}} {{gastroenteritis}} caused by norovirus (NoV) -contaminated oysters occur worldwide and have periodically {{been linked to}} the consumption of Australian oysters. Contamination with NoV can occur when <b>human</b> excrement (<b>faeces</b> and vomit) containing the virus flows into oyster growing areas. Minimal data about the occurrence of NoV in Australian oysters was available at the commencement of this thesis due to the expense involved in testing oysters for viruses because no Australian commercial laboratories had the capacity to perform the test. To that time, all Australian samples were tested in New Zealand. The aim of this Thesis was to establish an informed strategy for minimising the risk of NoV in commercial Australian oysters. To collect the NoV data, a sensitive and accurate method to detect NoV was adopted in this study and validated for Australian oysters and conditions. Epidemiological evidence suggests that the occurrence of NoV in Australian oysters is low; therefore a sampling regime for the detection of NoV at low occurrence and concentration in oysters was designed. Using this sampling programme, NoV was detected in oysters (8. 3...|$|R

40|$|Noroviruses are {{the most}} common cause of nonbacterial {{gastroenteritis}} outbreaks. A novel method was tested that utilizes sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) /EDTA-pretreated chromatography paper strips to collect and transport norovirus-containing fresh stool samples. As confirmation, the strips were infected with different dilutions of <b>human</b> norovirus-containing <b>faeces</b> and stored at different temperatures (- 80, - 20, 4 degrees C, room temperature and 37 degrees C). Reverse transcription (RT) -PCR analysis was carried out after storage of the strips for 1, 7, 14, 60, and 120 days. The presence of amplifiable norovirus RNA on the strips was inversely correlated with the duration of storage and the storage temperature. Norovirus RNA remained detectable for a sufficient amount of time at room temperature or even in warmer climatic conditions to allow transportation of the samples from a field site to a reference laboratory using regular postal mail. To prove that viral infectivity was lost upon contact with the SDS/EDTA-treated strips, feline calicivirus F 9 (10 (7) TCID(50) /ml) was loaded onto the strips. After elution and dialysis, no cytopatic effect could be observed upon incubation on Crandell-Reese feline kidney cells.
