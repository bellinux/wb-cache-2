5000|$|Dr. Richard Lewis Latterell is a {{scientist}} in plant genetics. He completed his PhD {{study on the}} plant genus nicotina in 1958 at Cornell University. Dr. Latterell also studied the interaction of bees and red clover plant species utilization, while at the University of Pennsylvania. Later in his career was a pioneer <b>exobiologist</b> on the Mars Simulator II (MSII), which simulated both the day/night cycle and the nitrogen & carbon dioxide environment of Mars in the Tarrytown, NY laboratory. Over 250 different seed types were tested for germination in the Mars Simulator II model, where over 50 plant species germinated without oxygen, including corn and rye. Studies found that an African succulent plant (cereus cactus) and a Peruvian cactus variety survived the longest in these Martian atmospheres.

40|$|Viking {{measurements}} of the Martian atmosphere indicate a value of N- 15 /N- 14 which is markedly greater than that found in Earth's atmosphere. These isotopic measurements provide a powerful diagnostic tool which {{may be used to}} derive valuable information regarding the past history of Mars and they have been used to place important constraints on the evolution of Mars' atmosphere. Initial partial pressures of nitrogen, outgassing rates, and integrated deposition of nitrogen into minerals have been calculated from this important atmospheric data (McElroy et al., 1976 and 1977; Fox and Dalgarno, 1983). The greater precision obtained in laser spectrometer isotopic measurements compared to the Viking data will greatly improve these calculated values. It has also been proposed that the N- 15 /N- 14 value in Mars' atmosphere has increased monotonically over time (McElroy et al., 1977; Fox and Dalgarno, 1983; Wallis, 1989) owing to preferential escape of atmospheric 14 N to space. Nitrogen isotopic ratios might be used to identify relatively ancient crustal rocks (R. Mancinelli, personal communication), and perhaps determine relative aces of surface samples. As a first step in successfully measuring nitrogen isotopes optically we have demonstrated the measurement of 15 NI 14 N to a precision of 0. 1 % (See Figures 1 - 4) using a tunable diode laser and an available gas (N-,O) with spectral lines in the 2188 cm- 1 region. The sample and reference gas cells contained gases of identical isotopic composition so that the 15 NI 14 N absorption ratio determined from the sample cell, when divided by the 15 NI 14 N absorption ratio determined from the reference cell, should yield an ideal value of unity. The average measured value of this "ratio of ratios" was 0. 9983 with a standard deviation (20 values) of 0. 0010. This corresponds to a precision of 0. 1 % (1 per mil) for nitrogen isotopes, a value sufficiently precise to provide important isotopic data of interest to <b>exobiologists.</b> The precision presently attainable in gases is sufficient to permit the instrument {{to be used in the}} measurement of isotopic ratios of interest to <b>exobiologists</b> as well as geologists and planetary scientists...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{knowledge of}} the history and abundances of the biogenic elements and their compounds throughout the solar system can provide the <b>exobiologists</b> with a basis for understanding the conditions necessary for chemical evolution and the origin of life. The Ion Mobility Drift Spectrometer is an ion molecule reactor coupled with an ion drift spectrometer. Sample molecules are ionized to form product ions in the reactant region. An electric field moves the ions through a drift region against the flow of a drift gas where they are separated according to their size and structure producing an ion mobility spectrum. These spectra provide the IMDS with virtually universal sample identification capability. To conform to the rigid limits of weight, volume and consumables placed on flight instrumentation, several aspects of the IMDS must be studied and redesigned for flight use. In addition to miniaturization of the instrument, {{a reduction in the}} high flow rates used for the drift gas is an obvious necessary consideration. The effect of drastically reduced drift flow rates on IMDS spectra was investigated by lowering flow rates from 500 ml/min to 50 ml/min. Changes in peak shape, drift time and total spectra were studied at each flow rate...|$|R
40|$|For the {{investigation}} of terrestrial ice layers different kinds of penetration devices exist. Examples are drills, hammering devices (moles) and melting probes. With the development of planetary lander missions the availability of suitable instruments for subsurface investigations of planetary ice layers becomes increasingly important. In particular the polar layers of the Mars polar caps and {{the surface of the}} Jovian satellite Europa have been proposed in the recent past as interesting targets for subsurface ice investigations. The permanent ice caps on Mars may contain key information for the understanding of the recent geological history and the water exchange between the atmosphere and the surface. Europa is particularly interesting for <b>exobiologists,</b> since primitive forms of life may exist in the supposed subsurface ocean, which might also be frozen into the near-surface ice. Recently at the Space Research Institute in Graz a new study was initiated in the frame of an ESA contract to develop a "melting probe" suitable for the use on bodies with low surface pressure. In this contribution we introduce the thermal and mechanical design of a first prototype and report on the results of ice penetration tests under cryovacuum conditions as well as the first results of thermal modelling...|$|R
5000|$|The six-member ISS crew {{captures the}} {{spacecraft}} and <b>exobiologist</b> Hugh Derry revives a dormant cell from the sample, and it quickly grows into a multi-celled organism that American school children name [...] "Calvin". After an atmospheric {{accident in the}} lab, Calvin becomes dormant. Hugh revives Calvin with mild electric shocks, but Calvin immediately becomes hostile and attacks Hugh, crushing his hand. While Hugh lies unconscious from Calvin's attack, Calvin uses the electric shock tool Hugh wielded to escape his immediate enclosure. Now free in the lab room, Calvin devours a lab rat by absorbing it and grows in size. Engineer Rory Adams uses the opportunity to enter the room and rescue Hugh. However, Calvin latches onto Rory's leg and physician David Jordan locks Rory in the room to keep Calvin contained. After Rory unsuccessfully attacks Calvin with a flame thrower, Calvin enters his mouth, killing him by devouring his organs from the inside. Emerging from Rory's mouth even larger, Calvin escapes through a fire-control vent. Hugh theorizes that lack of breathable air on Mars is what kept the organism dormant.|$|E

Arriving to help, they find the ship contains only one non-humanoid life form on the verge of dying. They transport the scorpion-like creature to Sickbay, and The Doctor begins to try to treat it. B'Elanna Torres, having learned of how the creature interacts with its ship, arrives to provide advice, but suddenly the creature leaps at her. It wraps itself around her, piercing her neck and other vital organs, creating a physical and biochemical bond between them. The Doctor finds that attempting to pull the creature off will likely kill Torres, and seeks another solution. When he exhausts his own knowledge, he searches through the Voyager databanks and discovers information on the brilliant Cardassian <b>exobiologist</b> Crell Moset. The Doctor programs the holodeck to recreate Moset as to work out the solution for separating the creature from Torres together, and they develop a rapport with each other. Moset finds a method that they could separate the creature, likely killing it while leaving Torres alive, but the Doctor would rather save both patients.|$|E

40|$|Observational {{evidence}} such as outflow {{channels and}} valley networks {{suggest that in}} the past there was flowing water on Mars. The images of fluvial features on Mars logically suggest that there must exist downstream locations in which the water pooled and the sediment load deposited (i. e. lakes). Sediments and morphological features associated with the martian paleolakes are believed to occur in Valles Marineris, and several large basins including Amazonis, Chryse and Elysium planitia. As Mars became progressively colder over geological time, any lakes on its surface would have become seasonally, and eventually perennially ice-covered. We know from polar lakes on Earth that ice-covered lakes can persist even when the mean annual temperature falls below freezing. Thus, the most recent lacustrine sediments on Mars were probably deposited in ice-covered lakes. While life outside of the Earth's atmosphere has yet to be observed, there is a general consensus among <b>exobiologists</b> that the search for extraterrestrial life should be based upon liquid water. The inference that there was liquid water on Mars during an earlier epoch is the primary motivation for considering the possibility of life during this time. It would be of enormous interest from both an exobiological and paleolimnological perspective to discover lakes or the evidence of former lakes on another planet such as Mars. Limnology would then become an interplanetary science...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} to simulate a rover mission on Mars was performed using the Russian Marsokhod rover deployed on Kilauea Volcano HI in February, 1995. A Russian Marsokhod rover chassis {{was equipped with}} American avionics equipment, stereo cameras on a pan and tilt platform, a digital high resolution body-mounted camera, and a manipulator arm on which was mounted a camera with a close-up lens. The six wheeled rover is 2 meters long and has a mass of 120 kg. The imaging system was designed to simulate that used on the planned "Mars Together" mission. The rover was deployed on Kilauea Volcano HI and operated from NASA Ames {{by a team of}} planetary geologists and <b>exobiologists.</b> Two modes of mission operations were simulated for three days each: (1) long time delay, low data bandwidth (simulating a Mars mission), and (2) live video, wide-bandwidth data (allowing active control simulating a Lunar rover mission or a Mars rover mission controlled from on or near the Martian surface). Simulated descent images (aerial photographs) were used to plan traverses to address a detailed set of science questions. The actual route taken was determined by the science team and the traverse path was frequently changed in response to the data acquired and to unforeseen operational issues. Traverses were thereby optimized to efficiently answer scientific questions. During the Mars simulation, the rover traversed a distance of 800 m. Based on the time delay between Earth and Mars, we estimate that the same operation would have taken 30 days to perform on Mars. This paper will describe the mission simulation and make recommendations about incorporating rovers into the Mars surveyor program...|$|R
40|$|In Aug. 1988, the NASA Ames Research Center held {{a three-day}} {{symposium}} in Sunnyvale, California, {{to discuss the}} subject of exobiology {{in the context of}} exploration of the solar system. Leading authorities in exobiology presented invited papers and assisted in setting future goals. The goals they set were as follows: (1) review relevant knowledge learned from planetary exploration programs; (2) detail some of the information that is yet to be obtained; (3) describe future missions and how <b>exobiologists,</b> as well as other scientists, can participate; and (4) recommend specific ways exobiology questions can be addressed on future exploration missions. These goals are in agreement with those of the Solar System Exploration Committee (SSEC) of the NASA Advisory Council. Formed in 1980 to respond to the planetary exploration strategies set forth by the Space Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Planetary and Lunar Exploration (COMPLEX), the SSEC's main function is to review the entire planetary program. The committee formulated a long-term plan (within a constrained budget) that would ensure a vital, exciting, and scientifically valuable effort through the turn of the century. The SSEC's goals include the following: determining the origin, evolution, and present state of the solar system; understanding Earth through comparative planetology studies; and revealing the relationship between the chemical and physical evolution of the solar system and the appearance of life. The SSEC's goals are consistent with the over-arching goal of NASA's Exobiology Program, which provides the critical framework and support for basic research. The research is divided into the following four elements: (1) cosmic evolution of the biogenic compounds; (2) prebiotic evolution; (3) origin and early evolution of life; and (4) evolution of advanced life...|$|R
40|$|Determination of {{molecular}} species comprised of the biogenic {{elements in the}} atmospheres of planets and moons {{of the solar system}} is one the foremost requirements of the <b>exobiologist</b> studying chemical evolution and the origin of life. Multiplex chromatography is a technique where many samples are pseudo-randomly introduced to the chromatograph without regard to elution of preceding components. The resulting data are then reduced using mathematical techniques such as cross correlation or Fourier Transforms. To demonstrate the utility of this technique for future solar system exploration, chemical modulators were developed. Several advantages were realized from this technique in combination with these modulators: improvement in detection limits of several orders of magnitude, improvement in the analysis of complex mixtures by selectively modulating some of the components present in the sample, {{increase in the number of}} analyses that can be conducted in a given period of time, and reduction in the amount of expendables needed to run an analysis. In order to apply this technique in a real application, methane in ambient air was monitored continuously over a period of one week. By using ambient air as its own carrier all expendables beyond power were eliminated...|$|E
5000|$|After {{starting}} his writing career by writing for true-confession style pulp magazines such as True Story, van Vogt decided {{to switch to}} writing something he enjoyed, science fiction. He {{was inspired by the}} August 1938 issue of Astounding Science Fiction, which he picked up at a newsstand. The story [...] "Who Goes There?" [...] led him to write [...] "Vault of the Beast", which he submitted to that same magazine. It was rejected, but the rejection letter encouraged him to try again. He sent in a story called [...] "Black Destroyer," [...] which was accepted. A rewritten version of [...] "Vault of the Beast" [...] would be published in 1940.Van Vogt's first SF publication was inspired by The Voyage of the Beagle by Charles Darwin. [...] "The Black Destroyer" [...] was published in July 1939 by John W. Campbell in Astounding Science Fiction, the centennial year of Darwin's journal. It featured a fierce, carnivorous alien, the coeurl, stalking the crew of an exploration spaceship. [...] "Discord in Scarlet" [...] was his second story to be published, also appearing as the cover story. It was accompanied by interior illustrations created by Frank Kramer and Paul Orban. (Van Vogt and Kramer thus debuted in the issue of Astounding that is sometimes singled out for ushering in the [...] "Golden Age" [...] of science fiction.) The former story served as the inspiration for multiple science fiction movies. In 1950, the two were combined with two other stories as a fix-up novel, The Voyage of the Space Beagle (Simon & Schuster), which was published in at least five European languages by 1955. Positing the need for <b>exobiologists</b> who will appreciate the differences between the inhabitants of other planets and ourselves, it stresses the importance of the civilian rather than military in exploration of other cultures.|$|R
40|$|Red Dwarfs (main-sequence / dwarf M or dM) {{stars are}} the most common stars in the Galaxy. These cool, faint, low mass stars {{comprise}} over 75 % of all stars. Because of their low luminosities (~ 0. 0008 - 0. 06 of the Sun's luminosity), the circumstellar habitable zones (HZs) of dM stars are located within ~ 0. 05 - 0. 4 AU of the host star. Nevertheless, the prospect of life on a planet located within the HZ of a red dwarf is moderately high, based on the longevity of these stars (> 50 Gyr), their constant luminosities and high space densities. Here we describe the aims and early results of the "Living with a Red Dwarf" Program - a study of dM stars that we have been carrying out over the last few years. The primary focus of our research on dM stars is the study of their magnetic dynamos and resulting star spots & coronal X-ray and chromospheric UV emissions as a function of age, rotation and spectral type. This program will provide datasets that can be used as inputs for the study of all aspects of dM stars, along with the planets already discovered hosted by them and the probable hundreds (thousands?) of planets expected to be uncovered in the near future by missions such as Kepler & Darwin/TPF. These datasets will be invaluable to those who model exo-planetary atmospheres, as well as <b>exobiologists</b> & astrobiologists who are studying the possibilities of life elsewhere in the universe. A significant element of our program is the determination of accurate stellar magnetic-driven X-ray-UV (X-UV) irradiances that are generated by the dM stars' vigorous magnetic dynamos. These X-UV irradiances (and flare frequencies) are strongly dependent on rotation, and thus age, and diminish as the stars lose angular momentum and spin-down over time via magnetic braking.
