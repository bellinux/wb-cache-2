5000|$|A {{video game}} is a {{computer-controlled}} game in which a video display, such as a monitor or television, is the primary <b>feedback</b> <b>device.</b> The term [...] "computer game" [...] also includes games which display only text (and which can, therefore, theoretically be played on a teletypewriter) or which use other methods, such as sound or vibration, as their primary <b>feedback</b> <b>device,</b> but {{there are very few}} new games in these categories. There always must also be some sort of input device, usually in the form of button/joystick combinations (on arcade games), a keyboard and mouse/trackball combination (computer games), a controller (console games), or a combination of any of the above. Also, more esoteric devices have been used for input, e.g., the player's motion. Usually there are rules and goals, but in more open-ended games the player may be free to do whatever they like {{within the confines of the}} virtual universe.|$|E

The use of <b>feedback</b> <b>devices</b> can also - via word of mouth - spread among households and thereby support the spread of the incentivized behavior, e. g. energy-efficient heating behavior. This study investigates how to manage the impact of these environmental innovations via marketing. Marketing activities can support the diffusion of devices. This study aims to identify the most effective strategies of marketing <b>feedback</b> <b>devices.</b> We did this by adapting an agent-based model to simulate the roll-out of a novel feedback technology and heating behavior within households in a virtual city. The most promising marketing strategies were simulated and their impacts were analyzed. We found it particularly effective to lend out <b>feedback</b> <b>devices</b> to consumers, followed by leveraging the social influence of well-connected individuals, and giving away the first few <b>feedback</b> <b>devices</b> for free. Making households aware of the possibility of purchasing <b>feedback</b> <b>devices</b> was found to be least effective. However, making households aware proved to be most cost-efficient.

40|$|BACKGROUND Efficiently {{performed}} basic {{life support}} (BLS) after cardiac arrest {{is proven to}} be effective. However, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is strenuous and rescuers' performance declines rapidly over time. Audio-visual <b>feedback</b> <b>devices</b> reporting CPR quality may prevent this decline. We aimed to investigate the effect of various CPR <b>feedback</b> <b>devices</b> on CPR quality. METHODS In this open, prospective, randomised, controlled trial we compared three CPR <b>feedback</b> <b>devices</b> (PocketCPR, CPRmeter, iPhone app PocketCPR) with standard BLS without feedback in a simulated scenario. 240 trained medical students performed single rescuer BLS on a manikin for 8 min. Effective compression (compressions with correct depth, pressure point and sufficient decompression) as well as compression rate, flow time fraction and ventilation parameters were compared between the four groups.

50|$|Powerslides force {{feedback}} is generated from information supplied {{directly from the}} physics engine. Slide and deflection forces acting upon the front wheels are transmitted directly to the force <b>feedback</b> <b>device.</b> Forces are also generated from collisions with other cars or awkward landings from jumps. All of these forces are generated {{in response to the}} particular conditions the driver is experiencing at the time. As a result, {{force feedback}} adds valuable information to the driving experience and makes it easier to feel what the vehicle is doing. This is in contrast to most other racing game force feedback where a series of canned force feedback events are triggered by different terrains or generic game events. Such force feedback adds nothing to the feel of the vehicle and can actually {{get in the way of}} good lap times.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the goal}} of {{enhancing}} the player's experience of synaesthesia, Mizuguchi has {{made a number of}} experiments into the realm of haptic feedback. Beginning soon after the release of Rez, Mizuguchi approached Sega's arcade division to propose an arcade version of the game which would include a cockpit chair parts of which would vibrate in time with the music. This idea never materialized, and Mizuguchi considered adapting the DualShock controller's haptic feedback for use in Rez, however he found it to be too weak for the game, and this lead him (through UGA) to approach ASCII to design a peripheral whose haptic function would be {{similar to that of the}} DualShock, but stronger. A [...] "Special Package" [...] version of the PlayStation 2 release of the game was sold in Japan only and included a USB-based haptic <b>feedback</b> <b>device</b> called a Trance Vibrator—a smooth computer mouse-sized peripheral that pulses in time with the music. The intended use of the device is to hold it, put it in a pocket, or sit on it while playing (a pouch was provided to protect the device), and thus to provide players with a closer approximation of synaesthesia by extending the game's music to the player's feeling of touch.|$|E
5000|$|The {{application}} {{stage is}} driven by the application where [...] "it begins the image generation process that results in the final scene of frame of animation. Therefore creating a base filled with simple images, that then later on build up into a bigger, more clear image". The application is implemented in the software thus giving the developers total control over the implementation in order to change the performance. This stage may, for example, contain collision detection, speed-up techniques, animations, force feedback, etc. One of the processes that is usually implemented in this stage is collision detection. Collision detection is usually includes algorithms that detects whether two objects collide. After a collision is detected between two objects, a response may be generated and sent back to the colliding objects as well as to a force <b>feedback</b> <b>device.</b> Other processes implemented in this stage included texture animation, animations via transforms, geometry morphing, or any kind of calculations that are not performed in any other stages. At the end of the application stage, which is also {{the most important part of}} this stage, the geometry to be rendered is fed to the next stage in the rendering pipeline. These are the rendering primitives that might eventually end up on the output device, such as points, lines, and triangles, etc.|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) -based nonlinear loop mirror with feedback has been investigated as a potential device for all-optical signal processing. In the <b>feedback</b> <b>device,</b> input signal pulses (ones) are injected into the loop, and amplified reflected pulses are fed back into the loop as switching pulses. The <b>feedback</b> <b>device</b> has two stable modes of operation - block mode, where alternating blocks of ones and zeros are observed, and spontaneous clock division mode, where halving of the input repetition rate is achieved. Improved models of the <b>feedback</b> <b>device</b> {{have been developed to}} study its performance in different operating conditions. The <b>feedback</b> <b>device</b> could be optimized to give a choice of either of the two stable modes by shifting the arrival time of the switching pulses at the SOA. Theoretically, it was found possible to operate the device at only tens of fJ switching pulse energies if the SOA is biased to produce very high gain in the presence of internal loss. The clock division regime arises from the combination of incomplete SOA gain recovery and memory of the startup sequence that is provided by the feedback. Clock division requires a sufficiently high differential phase shift per unit differential gain, which is related to the SOA linewidth enhancement factor...|$|E
40|$|Feedback {{devices have}} been shown {{to improve the quality of}} chest {{compression}} during cardiopulmonary resuscitation for patients in the supine position, but no studies have reported the effects of feedback devices on chest compression when the chest is tilted.

Thirty-six participants were studied. The <b>feedback</b> <b>device</b> did not affect the quality of chest compressions in the supine position, but improved aspects of performance in the tilted positions.

In the semirecumbent position, the proportion of compressions of correct depth was 21 (0 - 87 [0 - 100]) % with and 1 (0 - 26 [0 - 100]) % without feedback (p= 0. 05). Female participants applied chest compressions at a more accurate rate using the <b>feedback</b> <b>device</b> in the lateral tilted position but were unable to increase the chest compression depth, whereas male participants were able to increase the force of chest compression using the <b>feedback</b> <b>device</b> in the lateral tilted and semirecumbent positions.
