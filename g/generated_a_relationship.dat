A method, the Grid Analysis of Relationship Narratives, which uses the repertory grid to analyze couple 2 ̆ 7 s narratives of their relationship history, was developed and pilot tested with six couples in a non-clinical setting. The process of developing the method is discussed, and the results obtained presented.

In this paper, we briefly review the mechanism of phosphorus retention in wetlands, as well as previous modeling efforts. A Bayesian method is then proposed for estimating the long-term phosphorus accretion rate in wetlands through a piecewise linear model of outflow phosphorus concentration and phosphorus mass loading rate. The Bayesian approach was used for its simplicity in computation {{and its ability to}} accurately represent uncertainty. Applied to an Everglades wetland, the Bayesian method not only produced the probability distribution of the long-term phosphorus accretion rate, but also <b>generated</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> of acceptable level of "risk" and optimal phosphorus mass loading rate for the proposed constructed wetlands in south Florida.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the steady-state growth effect of inflation in an endogenous growth {{model in which}} the Calvo-type nominal rigidity with endogenous contract duration and monetary friction via wage-payment-in-advance constraint are assumed. On the balanced-growth path in this model, the marginal growth effect of inflation is weakly negative or even positive at low inflation rates because the effect on average markup offsets the negative marginal growth effect through the monetary friction but the growth effect of inflation is negative and convex at higher inflation rates because the frequency of price adjustment approaches that of the flexible-price economy and the growth effect through the nominal rigidity {{is dominated by the}} growth effect through the monetary friction. With a plausible calibration of the structural parameters, this model <b>generates</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> between inflation and growth that is consistent with empirical evidence, especially in industrial countries. ...|$|R

By qualitatively researching two successful case studies in Indonesia, it was found that for a top-down approach using CoP elements, bridging social capital was developed leading to both profit and nonprofit entrepreneurial activities.

For a top down approach with a local leader functioning as a social entrepreneur, bridging social capital was also developed leading to both profit and non-profit entrepreneurial activities...|$|R

40|$|Linking annual {{tree growth}} with remotely-sensed {{terrestrial}} vegetation indices provides {{a basis for}} using tree rings as proxies for ecosystem primary productivity over large spatial and long temporal scales. In contrast with most previous tree ring/remote sensing studies that have focused on temperature-limited boreal and taiga environments, here we compare the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with a network of Pinus brutia tree ring width chronologies collected along ecological gradients in semiarid Cyprus, where both radial tree growth and broader vegetation activity are controlled by drought. We find that the interaction between precipitation, elevation, and land-cover type <b>generate</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> between radial tree growth and NDVI. While tree ring chronologies at higher-elevation forested sites do not exhibit climatedriven linkages with NDVI, chronologies at lower-elevation dry sites are strongly correlated with NDVI during the winter precipitation season. At lower-elevation sites, land cover is dominated by grasslands and shrublands and tree ring widths operate {{as a proxy for}} ecosystem-scale vegetation activity. Tree rings can therefore be used to reconstruct productivity in water-limited grasslands and shrublands, where future drought stress is expected to alter the global carbon cycle, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning in the 21 st century...|$|R
