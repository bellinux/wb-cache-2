5|$|The banded sugar ant {{was first}} {{described}} by German entomologist Wilhelm Ferdinand Erichson, who named it Formica consobrina in 1842. The holotype specimen is a queen collected from Tasmania, {{which is now}} housed in the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin. Formica consobrina was later moved to the genus Camponotus as Camponotus consobrinus, by entomologist Julius Roger in 1863. In 1933, American entomologist William Morton Wheeler described some subspecies and variants of the banded sugar ant. These subspecies were C. consobrinus lividipes and C. consobrinus nigriceps, while the variants were C. consobrinus var. obniger and C. consobrinus var. perthianus. Some of these classifications were short-lived; C. consobrinus nigriceps was later revived as a full species in 1934 as C. nigriceps, while C. consobrinus lividipes was synonymised with C. consobrinus.

40|$|International audienceIn Burkina-Faso, urban {{vegetable}} {{agriculture is}} often characterized by urban solid waste fertilizer inputs containing heavy metals such as Cu and Cd. Thus, {{the relevance of}} surrounding urban vegetable plots with vetiver hedges to reduce environmental pollution by Cu and Cd was investigated by adsorption studies and pot experiments. Vetiver biomass, its metal contents and, its total and MgCl 2 extractable soil metals were monitored over 6 months {{in the presence of}} a mixture of metal at two concentrations: 2 - 10 and 100 - 500 mg kg(- 1), <b>for</b> <b>Cd</b> and Cu, respectively. The Freundlich adsorption coefficient (K-f) values increased after vetiver growth and were significantly higher for vertisol than for lixisol. After 6 months, the vetiver that was grown on lixisol accumulated more metal, increasing up to 4635 mg kg(- 1) for Cu and to 21. 8 mg kg(- 1) <b>for</b> <b>Cd,</b> than did the vetiver that was grown on vertisol, increasing up to 1534 mg kg(- 1) for Cu and to 7. 2 mg kg(- 1) <b>for</b> <b>Cd.</b> The metal bioconcentration factor, which was significantly higher <b>for</b> <b>Cd,</b> increased with the applied concentration and ranged from 1. 6 to 14 for Cu and from 2. 3 to 22 <b>for</b> <b>Cd.</b> Additionally, the translocation factors were higher <b>for</b> <b>Cd</b> (0. 38 - 7. 3) than for Cu (0. 07 - 2. 6), and the translocation was easiest from lixisol than from vertisol.

Although bindings with metallothioneins and granules are proposed {{to be responsible for}} the accumulation of high metal concentration, routes and rates of metal accumulation in these animals are not known. In this study, we determined the biokinetics of Cd and Zn in two predatory marine gastropods (Babylonia formasae habei and Nassarius teretiusculus), including metal assimilation efficiency (AE) from ingested clam tissues, metal uptake rate from the dissolved phase, and metal efflux rate constant. The metal AEs were 87 - 99 % <b>for</b> <b>Cd</b> and 50 - 79 % for Zn in B. formasae habei. and were 84 - 94 % <b>for</b> <b>Cd</b> and 79 - 81 % for Zn in N. teretiusculus. respectively, feeding on clams radiolabeled from both the aqueous and dietary phases. The uptake rate constants from the dissolved phase were 0. 0562 1 g(- 1) per day <b>for</b> <b>Cd</b> and 0. 122 1 g(- 1) per day for Zn in N. teretiusculus. and 0. 0292 1 g(- 1) per day <b>for</b> <b>Cd</b> and 0. 0573 1 g(- 1) per day for Zn in B. formasae habei, respectively. The efflux rate constants were 0. 0011 per day <b>for</b> <b>Cd</b> and 0. 0138 per day for Zn in N. teretiusculus, and 0. 0055 per day <b>for</b> <b>Cd</b> and 0. 0057 per day for Zn in B, formasae habei. respectively. Using a simple kinetic model. we showed that the trophic transfer factor, defined as the ratio of metal concentration in predatory gastropods and metal concentration in prey organisms (bivalves), was greater than one under most circumstances, suggesting that Cd and Zn may be biomagnified during their trophic transfer from bivalves to gastropods. Furthermore, our model predicted that the dietary exposure dominated (> 90 %) the overall Cd and Zn accumulation in the two predatory gastropods. Our study also highlights the interspecies difference in metal biokinetics in marine gastropods. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
