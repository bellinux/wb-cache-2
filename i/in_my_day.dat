500|$|The Bible {{project has}} met with {{extensive}} criticism, including from fellow evangelistic Christian conservatives. Rod Dreher, a conservative editor and columnist, described the project as [...] "insane hubris" [...] and [...] "crazy"; he further described the project as [...] "It's like what you'd get if you crossed the Jesus Seminar with the College Republican chapter at a rural institution of Bible learnin. Ed Morrissey, another conservative Christian writer, wrote that bending the word of God to one's own ideology makes God subservient to an ideology, {{rather than the other}} way around. Joseph Farah, editor-in-chief of WorldNetDaily, stated: [...] "I've seen some incredibly stupid and misguided initiatives by 'conservatives' <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>day,</b> but this one takes the cake" [...] and [...] "There's certainly nothing 'conservative' about rewriting the Bible". Creation Ministries International wrote [...] "Forcing the Bible to conform to a certain political agenda, no matter if one happens to agree with that agenda, is a perversion of the Word of God and should therefore be opposed by Christians as much as 'politically correct' Bibles." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his {{retirement}} from professional Scouting, Goodman served the National Council of Churches (NCC) during 1951–1954 as the NCC's first general {{director of the}} United Church Men, a laymen's program he formed to strengthen men's ties to local churches and their communities. Goodman publicly inaugurated the laymen's group on October 7, 1951 in Cincinnati, Ohio. By the end of 1952, United Church Men departments were formed in more than 24states, providing financial support to NCC-affiliated colleges and missionary work. His new post entailed working closely with Eugene Carson Blake, NCC president (1954–1957), and meeting frequently with officials of the participating denominations in the NCC. Speaking with various men's church groups in the U.S. and abroad was, he believed, a means of promoting brotherhood. Reflecting on his NCC service with these notable church leaders, Goodman said {{more than a decade}} later, [...] "Great faith and devoted service, I am very sure, are for ordinary folk {{as well as for the}} clergy. ... I have been privileged to know some great clergymen <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>day</b> ... but I have also known and loved some truly great laymen, men whose lives and works matched their faith". Goodman retired from his NCC post on September 1, 1954 because of tuberculosis.|$|E

2500|$|In The Guardian {{obituary}} of Mandy Mitchell-Innes, Somerset and England cricketer of the 1930s and 1940s, {{the following}} is told: [...] "His (Mitchell-Innes') favourite memory was of sitting alongside Daniell at Taunton. Suddenly, Frank Lee, the batsman, {{was hit in the}} box. 'The box, you say,' thundered Daniell, a former England rugby captain. 'What namby-pamby nonsense is that?' A few minutes later it happened again and Daniell exploded: 'What does he need a so-called box for? <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>day,</b> we hit fours with our private parts'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Medawar was a {{scientist}} of great inventiveness who {{was interested in}} many other subjects including opera, philosophy and cricket. He was exceptionally tall, 6ft and 5 inches, physically robust, with a big voice noted particularly during his lectures. He was renowned for wit and humour, which he claimed inherited from his [...] "raucous" [...] mother. He did not receive a PhD as he could not afford the requisite ₤25, to which he commented, [...] "Morally I'm a PhD, ... Anyway it was unfashionable <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>day.</b> John Young [...] was not a PhD either." [...] He was regarded as the philosopher Karl Popper's best-known disciple in science.|$|E
2500|$|Trueman was {{an expert}} summariser for the BBC's Test Match Special radio cricket commentaries from 1974 to 1999, forming close friendships with {{commentators}} John Arlott and Brian Johnston. He was well known for his direct style of commentary and frequently used a catch phrase, [...] "I don't know what's going off out there", to express his dismay that current England players lacked his knowledge of tactics. Trueman was noted for his dislike of {{many aspects of the}} modern game, especially one-day cricket and the frequency with which current fast bowlers sustained injury. He was criticised by some for being unduly negative about current players and for glorifying cricket [...] "in my day". He once remarked, amusingly without any sense of irony: [...] "We didn't have metaphors <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>day.</b> We didn't beat about the bush".|$|E

2500|$|The actual {{origin of}} the term {{has been defined as}} a cross between the Italian words for veal (vitello) and beef (bovino) {{implying}} “an immature, lazy person without a clear identity or any notion {{of what to do with}} his life". In a 1971 letter, co-screenwriter Ennio Flaiano offered a fuller meaning of the word: [...] "The term vitellone was used <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>day</b> to define a young man from a modest family, perhaps a student – but one who had either already gone beyond the programmed schedule for his coursework, or one who did nothing all the time... I believe the term is a corruption of the word vudellone, the large intestine, or a person who eats a lot. It was a way of describing the family son who only ate but never 'produced' – like an intestine, waiting to be filled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in his childhood, Head's {{family moved}} from Stoke Newington to Stamford Hill where they {{inhabited}} a house decorated {{for them by}} William Morris. Henry had, by this time, attended two day schools and he now enrolled as a weekly boarder at Friends' School, Grove House, Tottenham. It was here that he met his first mentor, Mr. Ashford, a master at the school. Head described Ashford as [...] "one of the best teachers of natural science I have ever encountered." [...] This was the man, he said, to whom he [...] " [...] the fact that [...] was firmly grounded in the elements of natural science {{at an age when}} boys at an ordinary school <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>day</b> were ignorant of its existence." [...] Perhaps it is to Ashford that we owe the direction Head’s later studies took, though it is clear that Head had a natural propensity for scientific learning, even at this early age.|$|E
2500|$|On October 6, 2010, Palin {{spoke with}} reporters and fielded a {{question}} about Social Security. She stated, [...] "e {{are going to have}} to make some tough decisions today. Thomas Paine, one of our Founders, had said, 'If there is to be trouble, let it be <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>day,</b> so that my child may have peace.' What he meant way back then was that there should be an expectation that some sacrifices will have to be made, in our generation, so that future generations can have the opportunities that we've had to grow and thrive and prosper, so that our private sector can do what a private sector does best in creating jobs. So, yeah, with some practical things that have to be made, some decisions here, with perhaps changing, in future years, not adversely affecting those who are reliant on retirement benefits today, for instance, Social Security benefits, but changing, perhaps, the eligibility in future years. That has to be something that we're brave enough, courageous enough, to start talking about." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{narrative}} for Overwatch {{is led by}} Blizzard's senior game designer Michael Chu. Creating {{a narrative}} for the game was a challenge compared to past Blizzard titles as the game lacks a single-player mode or a traditional story-telling mechanic. Instead, the story crafters for the game sought to create a spanning narrative that could be interjected into the game through short in-game dialogue and unlockable hero skins. A March 2017 patch for the game added short character biographies, as well as lore details about specific character skins in the Hero Gallery. Outside of the game, the narrative is primarily driven by a transmedia storytelling method, which includes animated shorts and digitally released comics. This gives the developers some flexibility as to where they can take the story as Overwatch is expanded over the years. The narrative can still be seen being hinted at through map environments and character dialogue within the game itself; Chu explains that [...] "you get a character like Soldier: 76 and he says, like: 'back <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>day</b> we'd have this payload delivered'. And then you get a character like Zenyatta, the robot monk, {{and he would say}} something like, [...] "becoming one with the objective." [...] So we find these ways to really differentiate them and it makes for unexpected and sometimes ridiculous lines." [...] Blizzard also found ways to include narrative elements through limited-time events, such as the [...] "Junkenstein's Revenge" [...] event during October 2016 and the April 2017 [...] "Uprising" [...] event. Chu said that with these types of events, they will encourage players to explore the other forms of media that Blizzard is using to develop the Overwatch narrative, as well as prompt fans to continue to explore and speculate on the world and characters they created.|$|E
