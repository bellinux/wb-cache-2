40|$|Health as a {{value is}} the subject of the paper’s {{theoretical}} discussion and also research explorations. The author tries to define the notion of health and health as a value, what is quite difficult to explain in details, or it’s even <b>impossible.</b> <b>Considerations</b> concerning health as value are undertaken in eight planes. The final part of the paper presents review of selected research explorations concerning health as a value. The quoted researches indicate that health as the superior, priority value and therefore the most important one makes room for the hedonistic values, which contemporary young people value the most. In the final conclusions the author underlines that the shaping of the values of the young man including foremost health as a value results from the accepted world of values, shape and life of a family, as well as neglects of the school education.

40|$|Sensing {{uncertainty}} {{is a central}} issue in robotics. Sensor limitations often prevent accurate state estimation, and robots find themselves confronted with a complicated information (belief) space. In this paper we define and characterize the information spaces of very simple robots, called Bitbots, which have severe sensor limitations. While complete estimation of the robot’s state is <b>impossible,</b> careful <b>consideration</b> {{and management of the}} {{uncertainty is}} presented as a search in the information space. We show that these simple robots can solve several challenging online problems, even though they can neither obtain a complete map of their environment nor exactly localize themselves. However, when placed in an unknown environment, Bitbots can build a topological representation of it and then perform pursuitevasion (i. e., locate all moving targets inside this environment). This paper introduces Bitbots, and provides both theoretical analysis of their information spaces and simulation results...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports on}} the {{optimization}} of an Electro-Optic Voltage Transducer (EOVT) using a VHDL-AMS model. Specifically, two different voltage reconstruction schemes have been assessed: reconstruction using arctangent and using arccosine. Both schemes have been simulated for different applied voltages and phase shift errors between the two electrical signals produced by the EOVT. Despite the high complexity of the device (optical and electronic parts, digital and analogue signal processing), modeling has allowed estimating {{the performance of the}} system accurately. This would have been practically <b>impossible</b> through theoretical <b>considerations</b> alone. Results show the arctangent method to outperform arccosine.

It is shown the necessity of taking in account the skin effect in harmonic frequencies.

INTRODUTION The calculation of losses in electrical power networks is <b>impossible</b> without the <b>consideration</b> of resistance variation in high harmonic frequencies. Correct consideration of resistance in calculations of non-sinusoidal conditions {{is one of the}} most complex and necessary problems. In most cases the resistance of power supplying components in equivalent circuit are either neglected or are given constant value R 0, equaling the resistance to a direct current.

50|$|Unlike FOIL, {{which does}} not put typing {{constraints}} on its variables, FOCL uses typing as an inexpensive way of incorporating a simple form of background knowledge. For example, a predicate livesAt(X,Y) may have types livesAt(person, location). Additional predicates {{may need to be}} introduced, though - without types, nextDoor(X,Y) could determine whether person X and person Y live next door to each other, or whether two locations are next door to each other. With types, two different predicates nextDoor(person, person) and nextDoor(location, location) would need to exist for this functionality to be maintained. However, this typing mechanism eliminates the need for predicates such as isPerson(X) or isLocation(Y), and need not consider livesAt(A,B) when A and B are defined to be person variables, reducing the search space. Additionally, typing can improve the accuracy of the resulting rule by eliminating from <b>consideration</b> <b>impossible</b> literals such as livesAt(A,B) which may nevertheless appear to have a high information gain.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of information services, which is observed throughout {{the duration of}} the telecommunications industry, is in two main areas: the emergence of innovative services and increase the quality requirements of existing services. Modern telecommunications networks are a kind of engineering design objects and can be created "from scratch" and develop on the basis of existing solutions. Regardless of the technical implementation of this phase is preceded usually stage modeling to identify certain network parameters, important among which covers the structural reliability of the network. In such cases, {{there is a need for}} consideration of methods for assessing the structural reliability of the network as a whole and its individual links. Such methods are useful in the case of structural reliability assessment of complex networks with a given structure, where the application of known methods is difficult or <b>impossible.</b> Therefore, <b>consideration</b> of the possibility of using approximate methods of structural reliability assessment for multi-service networks, special purpose is relevant. As one way to assess the structural reliability of the network is proposed to assess it on the basis of bilateral assessment method based on structural reliability assessments Ezari - Proshana.

40|$|In {{support of}} {{algorithm}} {{development for the}} multiangle interferometric synthetic L-band radiometer on the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity sensor (SMOS) and for possible synergistic approaches with higher frequency microwave radiometers such as the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (C-band), an inventory {{has been made of}} polarization, angular, and frequency dependencies of vegetation optical depth and single-scattering albedo. Both parameters form the basis of a zero-order radiative transfer model, which is often used for inverse modeling of microwave observations from space. The inventory is based on experimental data published in the literature. Underlying models have been reviewed because data comparison is <b>impossible</b> without due <b>consideration</b> of the theoretical background. In general, it can be concluded that both single-scattering albedo and optical depth are angular, polarization, and frequency dependent. This dependence, however, depends on the canopy type and structure. Angular dependence implies that the cosine correction for the slant path through the canopy is no longer valid. Knowledge of these dependencies, therefore, is important for processing multiangle observations such as those anticipated for the planned SMOS and for possible synergistic approaches with C-band observations. Because of the existing variety of methods and procedures found in the literature, some guidelines for a protocol for field experiments are proposed in order to facilitate intercomparison of experimental results and proper incorporation of the parameters in zero-order transfer models...|$|R

The paper argues that the sometimes wild inconsistency of government policies hampers the success of reform programs and that, if anything, the only consistency in Nigerian governance seems to be corruption. Accordingly, today, amidst structural corruption, poor budgetary controls, and other challenges to policy implementation, reform programs are often viewed as a thing of the past. For the Seven-Point Agenda to succeed, it is therefore imperative that the corrupt political machinations and the lack of budgetary discipline be thoroughly considered and openly discussed by all stakeholders involved in the process.

The mean values of the several groups are so discordant, as is shown in Table 1/2, that a fairly precise numerical estimate seems <b>impossible.</b> But the <b>consideration</b> arises, whether the difference between pot and pot may not be of much the same order of importance {{as that of the}} other conditions upon which the growth of the plants has been modified. If so, and only on that condition, it would follow that when all the measurements, either of the crossed or the self-fertilised plants, were combined into a single series, that series would be statistically regular. The experiment is tried in Table 1/1, columns 7 and 8, where the regularity is abundantly clear, and justifies us in considering its mean as perfectly reliable. I have protracted these measurements, and revised them in the usual way, by drawing a curve through them with a free hand, but the revision barely modifies the means derived from the original observations. In the present, and in nearly all the other cases, the difference between the original and revised means is under 2 per cent of their value. It is a very remarkable coincidence that in the seven kinds of plants, whose measurements I have examined, the ratio between the heights of the crossed and of the self-fertilised ranges in five cases within very narrow limits.

40|$|Purpose. The {{scientific}} {{paper is}} supposed {{the determination of}} basic physical and structural conditions in modeling life cycle {{of the elements of}} the railway line for the study of deformation processes as the basis of normative base of the track at the condition of railway safety. Methodology. To achieve the aim principles of the elasticity theory and wave propagation process in the description of the interaction between the track and rolling stock were used. Findings. The basic physical and structural conditions under which it is necessary to carry out the simulation of the life cycle of the elements of the railway line for the study of deformation processes were determined. The basic physical and structural principles of drawing the design schemes of railway track elements for the process assessment of the track deformation work were formulated. The decision correctness and the possibility of the problem solution are proved. Originality. The study of the track reliability questions motivates the development of new models, allow considering it for some developments. There is a need to identify the main physical and structural conditions for assembly design schemes based on assessment and prediction of possible track state changes during its operation. The paper presents the basic principles of physical and structural drafting design schemes of railway line items for which Huygens’ principle is implemented. This principle can be performed only when the four dimensional space: the volume changing over time is considered. Practical value. Analytical models applied in determining the parameters of strength and resistance lines, fully satisfy the task, but {{can not be used to}} determine the parameters of track reliability. One of the main impossibility factors of these models is quasidynamic approach. Therefore, as a rule, receive and examine not only dynamic process of a railway track, but also its consequences. Besides, these models are related to flat ones, and it also adds some complexity in results comparing with an experiment, as well as the process is not easy to distinguish the impact of volume in its limited parts. The use of numerical methods extend the posibilities, and it also make it <b>impossible</b> for the <b>consideration</b> of the dynamic process, as well as it is impossible to introduce processes, causing the reaction to stress load. Thus the basic physical and constructive approaches in modeling make it possible to consider the dynamic process of localized both in time and in space directly...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} {{multi-sector}} overlapping generations, life-cycle general equilibrium model to conduct a simulation analysis with regard to fiscal reconstruction in Japan. An overlapping generations life-cycle general equilibrium model is a dynamic model comprising a household sector that from a long-term perspective engages in consumption activity and provides a corporate sector with labor and capital, a corporate sector that engages in production activity, and a government sector that collects taxes and insurance premiums from households and firms, supplies public goods, and provides pensions {{and other forms of}} social security. This model enables us to conduct long-term simulations of the impact of policy changes, for example increases in consumption taxes and reductions of expenditure, on economic variables such as economic growth rates and levels of consumption by households. Hitherto, most life-cycle general equilibrium analyses in Japan have simplified the manufacturing sector as a single sector, making it <b>impossible</b> to give <b>consideration</b> to differences between the targets of expenditure cuts. A feature of this paper is that it makes this possible by extending this to multiple sectors. A temporary shock seen in the results of the simulation in this paper is that an increase in consumption taxes causes a rise in GDP. This rise in GDP, however, is caused by an increase in the consumption of fixed capital, and national income declines. As regards differences in the methods of reducing expenditure, cuts in education spending and other government spending cause a greater reduction in gross production than reductions in public investment. This is because the reduction of public investment causes capital formation to decline and thus has a long-term negative impact on production activity, whereas the reduction of education spending and other such government spending has a negative impact directly on production activity {{at the time of the}} reduction. In the medium term, cases in which consumption taxes are increased make it possible to achieve high GDP, though in the long term GDP increases in cases in which public investment and education spending are reduced. Our analysis also shows that cases of reductions in other types of government spending are accompanied by lower GDP than in any of the other cases. As regards the ratio of public debt to GDP we find that there are only slight differences between the cases, but that it is lowest in cases of increases in consumption taxes, followed by the cases in which public investment is reduced. ...|$|R
40|$|Driving {{under the}} {{influence}} of alcohol and/or drugs (DUID) is a safety issue of increasing public concern. When a police officer has reasonable grounds to classify a driver as impaired, he may arrange for a blood sample to be taken. In many countries, alcohol analysis only is ordered if impairment is suspected to be exclusively due to alcohol while comprehensive toxicological screening will be performed if additional suspicion for other illegal drugs of abuse (DoA) or medicinal drugs is on hand. The aim of the present study was firstly to evaluate whether signs of impairment can be differentiated to be caused by alcohol alone or a combination of alcohol and other driving-impairing drugs and secondly to which extent additional drugs are missed in suspected alcohol-impaired drivers. A total of 293 DUID cases (negative n = 41; alcohol positive only, n = 131; alcohol + active drug positive, n = 121) analyzed in 2015 in the Canton of Zurich were evaluated for their documented impairment symptoms by translating these into a severity score and comparing them applying principle component analysis (PCA). Additional 500 cases suspected for alcohol-impaired driving only were reanalyzed using comprehensive LC-MS/MS screening methods covering about 1500 compounds. Drugs detected were classified for severity of driving impairment using the classification system established in the DRUID study of the European Commission. As partly expected from the pharmacological and toxicological point of view, PCA analysis revealed no differences between signs of impairment caused by alcohol alone and those caused by alcohol plus at least one active drug. Breaking it down to different blood alcohol concentration ranges, only between 0. 3 and 0. 5 g/kg trends could be observed in terms of more severe impairment for combined alcohol and drug intake. In the 500 blood samples retrospectively analyzed in this study, a total of 330 additional drugs could be detected; in some cases up to 9 co-ingested ones. In total, 37 % of all cases were positive for additional drugs, thereby 15 % of classic DoAs and further 9 % of prescription drugs with a severe risk to cause driving impairment based on the DRUID classification system. A decision whether signs of impairment are related to alcohol alone or to the combination of alcohol and other drugs is <b>impossible.</b> Taking into <b>consideration</b> the high rate of missed drugs in DUI cases, police should think about increasing the number of DUID cases in countries were sanctioning differs between alcohol and alcohol plus drug impaired driving...|$|R
