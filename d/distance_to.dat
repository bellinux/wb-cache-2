5|$|The <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> Beta Pictoris {{and many}} other stars was {{measured}} by the Hipparcos satellite. This was done by measuring its trigonometric parallax: the slight displacement in its position observed as the Earth moves around the Sun. Beta Pictoris was found to exhibit a parallax of 51.87 milliarcseconds, a value which was later revised to 51.44 milliarcseconds when the data was reanalyzed taking systematic errors more carefully into account. The <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> Beta Pictoris is therefore 63.4 light years, with an uncertainty of 0.1 light years.|$|E

5|$|The <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> the Pleiades {{can be used}} as an {{important}} first step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> the Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E
5|$|The first {{professional}} astronomer {{to support the}} concept of an infinite Universe was the Englishman Thomas Digges in 1576. But the scale of the Universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> a nearby star in 1838 by the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel. He showed that the star 61 Cygni had a parallax of just 0.31arcseconds (compared to the modern value of 0.287″). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years. The <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> the Andromeda Galaxy was determined in 1923 by American astronomer Edwin Hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy, a new technique discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. This established that the Andromeda galaxy, and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the Milky Way.|$|E
