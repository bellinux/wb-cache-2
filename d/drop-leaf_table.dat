50|$|In {{addition}} to working exclusively with recycled materials of the cheapest kind, Brigham planned {{many of her}} designs to be space-saving (a <b>drop-leaf</b> <b>table,</b> a set of nesting stools) as they were aimed primarily at urban apartment dwellers. Brigham also took a modular or sectional approach to some of her pieces, as several of the smaller pieces are designed {{in such a way}} that they can either stand alone or work as subunits of larger pieces.|$|E

50|$|A <b>drop-leaf</b> <b>table</b> is a {{table that}} has a fixed section {{in the center and}} a hinged section (leaf) on either side that can be folded down (dropped). If the leaf is {{supported}} by a bracket when folded up, the table is simply a drop-leaf table; if the leaf is supported by legs that swing out from the center, it is known as a gate leg table. These tables can be made of a variety of woods from Cherry to Walnut, to Maple or Mahogany. Depending on the style or drop leaf or gate leg tables, the leaves vary from coming almost down to the floor to only coming down slightly. Uses vary from drop leaf dining tables, night stands, side tables, coffee tables,and desks.|$|E
40|$|Mornings, this autumn, I see {{the girls}} {{skipping}} past {{on their way}} to school, and my heart lifts at the sound of their bright voices. I live at the end of Locust Street in a onestory frame house with a porch that wraps around the side. If visitors know me, they knock on the side door when they come, aware that I spend most of my time in the dining room where I have my television set and the oak <b>drop-leaf</b> <b>table</b> I inherited from my mother, and the rocking chair, reupholstered now, that belonged to my father. I sit at the table working a crossword. The television is on for the noise, usually some sort of news show on CNN because I like to keep up to date. I may be {{on the far side of}} eighty, but Iâ€™m not dead yet. The world can still amaze me...|$|E
