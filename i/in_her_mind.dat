5|$|After Ultimecia is defeated, {{the time}} and space that she had absorbed begin to return to normal, pulling Squall's comrades back into their places in the timeline, while Squall returns to the orphanage and meets a younger Edea. Since {{she does not want}} to involve the children, she absorbs the dying Ultimecia's powers as part of the cycle of sorceresses (a sorceress must pass her powers to a {{successor}} before she can die peacefully). Squall plants the ideas for Garden and SeeD <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> creating an origin paradox: Squall must become leader of Balamb Garden so he can pass its version of SeeD tradition to Edea, who teaches them to her husband Cid (who co-founds Balamb Garden, which admits Edea's orphans—including Squall).|$|E
5|$|I went to New York {{and we were}} in {{the studio}} and came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|The mind of William Bell (Leonard Nimoy) still {{possesses}} Olivia's (Anna Torv) body {{after several}} failed attempts to extract it to recently deceased corpses. Walter (John Noble) and William {{believe that they}} have less than a day before Olivia's mind will be lost. They realize that Olivia is unaware that she has been possessed by William's mind, and instead has likely locked her ego away, making it difficult to contact her by normal means. Walter comes up with a plan: he and Peter (Joshua Jackson) will enter Olivia's mind with the aid of LSD to locate her ego and help it to regain dominance <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> while Walter hopes to download William's mind into a computer.|$|E
60|$|The blood left Cicely's cheeks. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind's</b> eye she saw Abbot Maldon {{turned into}} a great cat with a monk's head and patting Christopher with his claws.|$|R

60|$|The {{suggestion}} of the sage Peter was {{a vision of}} glory to the mother. She already saw Dolph, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind's</b> eye, with a cane at his nose, a knocker at his door, and an M.D. {{at the end of}} his name--one of the established dignitaries of the town.|$|R
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Nowe {{becoming}} a fully-fledged Knight of the Seal. During his first mission, Nowe begins {{to doubt the}} ethics of the Knights' methods, as the seals require human sacrifices to remain strong. During a second mission to ensure {{the protection of the}} seal in the District of Soul Flame, Nowe encounters Manah, who kills the guardian Zhangpo and destroys the seal. Manah is sentenced to be burnt at the stake, but uses her magic to escape. After returning from the mission, Nowe is poisoned by Gismor, who reveals to have killed Nowe's adoptive father Oror. Surviving and escaping with Legna, Nowe is pursued by the Knights, including Eris, who wishes to persuade him to return. Nowe and Legna eventually meet up with Manah and join her on her quest to destroy the seals and, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> free the people from the Knights' oppression. On their way to the second seal, Manah shows Nowe the true horror of the Knights' oppression, fully winning him over. The two then fight and kill Lieutenant Hanch, destroying the seal in the District of Hallowed Water. After this, they are joined by Urick, a former Lieutenant of the Knights, to rout a group of bandits. Attacked by the Knights, they are unexpectedly saved by Caim, who is also working to destroy the seals and free his dragon Angelus from the pain of being the Goddess Seal. After taking down Lieutenant Yaha and destroying the seal in the District of Precious Light, Manah is captured by the Knights and sentenced to death. Nowe manages to rescue her and heads for the seal in the District of Shining Life, which was once guarded by Urick before he fled in fear when Caim attacked the district. Urick and Nowe face off against Caim, who mortally wounds Urick before being driven off. Urick dies content and the seal is destroyed.|$|E
25|$|In 1975 Maggie is {{operated}} on by Bill Horton (Mickey's brother), {{but she still}} cannot walk. Laura Horton (Bill's wife and Mickey's ex-wife) explains to her that her paralysis is no longer physical, but mental. Maggie is so afraid of losing Mickey that she is causing the paralysis <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> After Mickey officially divorces Laura, Mickey and Maggie are married on Jan 25, 1975.|$|E
25|$|In the letter, Germain {{said that}} number theory was her {{preferred}} field, {{and that it}} was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> all the time she was studying elasticity. She outlined a strategy for a general proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, including a proof for a special case. Germain's letter to Gauss contained her substantial progress toward a proof. She asked Gauss if her approach to the theorem was worth pursuing. Gauss never answered.|$|E

60|$|Meriem was entranced. His tales {{were like}} fairy stories to this little jungle maid. The Hon. Morison loomed large and {{wonderful}} and magnificent <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind's</b> eye. He fascinated her, {{and when he}} drew closer to her after a short silence {{and took her hand}} she thrilled as one might thrill beneath the touch of a deity--a thrill of exaltation not unmixed with fear.|$|R

25|$|According to Thomas Powers, {{the author}} of Diana: The Making of a Terrorist, the more Oughton learned about the hard life of rural Guatemala, the more she {{reflected}} on the affluence of the United States. In Chichicastenango, Americans seemed an alien presence; the fact of their wealth was almost {{an insult to the}} impoverished Indians. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> confusion emerged that lasted the rest of her life: she had rejected affluence (at first almost unconsciously) to work among the poor, but poverty, clearly, was nothing to be envied. She hated poverty, but she hated affluence, too. Oughton left Chichicastenango with a new view of the problems that undeveloped countries like Guatemala faced when in struggle with the United States.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to the X-Men in Kwannon's body, Psylocke psionically and telepathically manipulated Cyclops, her team leader, into being romantically attracted to her. After regaining her full personality from Kwannon, Psylocke offered a belated apology to Jean Grey, admitting that the flirtation {{was due to the}} presence of Kwannon's lingering personality traits <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> but that she did in fact find Cyclops attractive. Later, Elizabeth and Archangel had a romantic relationship, but chose to end it after realizing that the differences between them were too great. After Betsy's death, Archangel suffered anguish from being unable to save her, but eventually made peace with it and moved on to a relationship with Paige Guthrie.|$|E
25|$|Legenden om Ljusets rike or Sagnet om Lysets rike in some Scandinavian {{language}} (in English The Legend of the Realm of Light; {{this novel}} {{has not been}} translated into English) {{is a set of}} fantasy novels by Norwegian-Swedish writer Margit Sandemo. It includes twenty titles. This set of novels can be read in Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic and Polish. Margit Sandemo says that she wrote this series of novels because she wanted, like many other fiction writers, to portray her own view about an idealized world. Another reason to write Legenden om Ljusets rike was for the character called Marco who Sandemo created in the end of The Legend of the Ice People. She was so fond of him that she wanted to write more about Marco in the following series of novels. Those ideas took shape <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> when she had written around half of Häxmästaren.|$|E
50|$|On April 11 {{an attempt}} was made by the doctors from Butabika to carry out a {{psychiatric}} assessment examination to determine if she was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>minds</b> or insane as the government prosecutor was alleging but she managed to resist the examination and requested that at least one family member should be present and her personal doctor if they want to carry out a medical test on her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm {{glad you}} feel so. It adds {{so much to}} one's {{happiness}} to love the task one does. I used to hate teaching; but housekeeping for my own family was always sweet, though much harder in many ways. Isn't Aunt Jo pleased about all this?' asked Mrs Meg, already seeing <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind's</b> eye a splendid sign with 'Tiber, Brooke & Co.' over {{the door of a}} famous publishing house.|$|R
60|$|But {{these were}} all gone, and I pacified Helen by assuring her that I would tell her such long stories about these things that she could almost see them <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind's</b> eye. But I think, {{by the way she}} smiled, that she had only a second-rate degree of belief in my power of description. She was a smart little thing, and she {{believed}} that Corny was the queen of girls.|$|R
25|$|In 1952, Florence {{attempted}} to swim the 26 miles between Catalina Island and the California coastline. As she began, she was flanked by small boats that watched for sharks and {{were prepared to}} help her if she got hurt or grew tired. After about 15 hours a thick fog set in. Florence began to doubt her ability, and she told her mother, who {{was in one of}} the boats, that she did not think she could make it. She swam for another hour before asking to be pulled out, unable to see the coastline due to the fog. As she sat in the boat, she found out she had stopped swimming just one mile away from her destination. Two months later, she tried again. The same thick fog set in, but she succeeded in reaching Catalina. She said that she kept a mental image of the shoreline <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> while she swam. She later swam the Catalina channel on two additional occasions.|$|E
25|$|Elsbeth, her {{page and}} {{the ladies of}} the court are walking in the palace grounds. She {{does not want to}} talk about her future {{marriage}} but of the poor jester whom she so admired. She sends the others away but then discovers Fantasio who amuses her with his banter about the flowers; she is intrigued by the unknown jester. The king, the prince and Marinoni (disguised as each other) enter. Elsbeth is not impressed by the aide-de-camp's song. When she and Fantasio are alone he casts more doubt <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> about going ahead with the liaison with the prince, and she longs for a reason to delay the union. The court enter and while Marinoni (as the prince) sings her a pompous song in praise of beauty Fantasio climbs a tree and with a stick lifts the wig from the head of the false prince. The marriage of the Mantuan prince is immediately compromised but Fantasio is taken away.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Mary's {{failure to}} learn exactly what seeing red feels like {{is simply a}} failure of language, or a failure {{of our ability to}} {{describe}} experiences. An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly able to teach their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel. Perhaps it is simply a uniquely human failing to communicate first-person experiences from a third-person perspective. Dennett suggests that the description might even be possible using English. He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work. What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles? An English-language description of just a few words would be sufficient for her to imagine {{what it is like to}} see a triangle—she can simply and directly visualize a triangle <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> Similarly, Dennett proposes, it is perfectly, logically possible that the quale of what it is like to see red could eventually be described in an English-language description of millions or billions of words.|$|E
60|$|With {{the true}} {{instinct}} of her breed, Francie {{had made a}} point of knowing the right people--people who would write about her, and talk about <b>her,</b> and people <b>in</b> Society, too--keeping a mental register of just where to exert her fascinations, and an eye on that steady scale of rising prices, which <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind's</b> eye represented the future. In this way she caused herself to be universally respected.|$|R
60|$|One night, two {{or three}} weeks after the bridal return, when the boy was gone to bed, Rhoda sat a long time over the turf ashes that she had raked out <b>in</b> front of <b>her</b> to {{extinguish}} them.

At last, wearied with her day's work, she too retired.|$|R

25|$|Home Life of Great Authors, {{published}} in Chicago, in 1877, included descriptive sketches of many authors, with glimpses {{of their home}} life and personal and domestic character: Goethe, Wordsworth, Lamb, Shelley, Emerson, George Sand, Tennyson, Whittier, Robert and Elizabeth B. Browning, Poe, Eliot, Burns, De Quincey, North, Irving, Carlyle, Macaulay, Hawthorne, Holmes, Charlotte Bronte, Thackeray, Kingsley, Madame de Stael, Scott, Lord Byron, Bryant, Hugo, Lytton, Longfellow, Lowell, Margaret Fuller, Dickens, and Ruskin. As its title would indicate, the book aimed to give a more personal and intimate view {{of men and women}} well-known to fame than was to be found in most reference works. The young readers of this volume learned that dates and statistics do not enable them to know people; they need to have some personal details as to the habits and daily lives of the people about whom they read. Griswold said in one of her works that as she had had such a hard time {{when she was a girl}} getting any picture <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> of the great people about whom she read, that she determined to make it easier for other boys and girls to obtain these mental pictures; that is why she wrote The Home Life of Great Authors.|$|E
25|$|Śrīrāghavapriyādarśanam (Sanskrit: श्रीराघवप्रियादर्शनम्). Viśvāmitra, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa {{arrive in}} Mithilā. Rāma {{is pleased to}} be in the city of Mithilā, but the other kings who have come in Sītā's Svayaṃvara are not pleased about his arrival. The people of Mithilā {{experience}} bliss in seeing Rāma. When Janaka asks Viśvāmitra about the two princes, Viśvāmitra introduces Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to Janaka. Janaka takes both princes to his palace and welcomes them. Later Lakṣmaṇa wishes to see the city of Mithilā and Rāma accompanies him. The children of Mithilā take Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa around the city, and embrace Rāma in the end. Early morning on the next day, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa go to the royal garden of Janaka to get flowers for Viśvāmitra's worship. Sītā arrives in the same garden to worship Pārvatī on the day before her Svayaṃvara. Sītā and Rāma see each other for the first time when they come face-to-face in the garden. Rāma tells Lakṣmaṇa about the attraction he feels for Sītā. He tells Lakṣmaṇa that Sītā must be his wife in future, for even in his dreams his mind never longs for the wife of another. Lakṣmaṇa then bows to Sītā, thinking of her as his mother. Sītā worships Rāma <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> and then departs for her palace after worshipping Pārvatī. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa return to Viśvāmitra and worship him with the flowers from Janaka's royal garden. Rāma tells Viśvāmitra everything about the attraction he felt for Sītā. Viśvāmitra blesses Rāma and goes to sleep. Rāma is awake in the night, admiring the beauty of the moon which reminds him of the face of Sītā.|$|E
500|$|Olivia wakes {{back up to}} {{the real}} world, free of William's mind. Walter find that his effort to store William's mind has failed, and takes time to {{consider}} William's last message he gave to Olivia: [...] "I knew the dog wouldn't hunt". Later, Peter visits Olivia to rekindle their relationship when he notices a drawing of the same man in the X t-shirt he saw <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> Olivia cannot name the man, but nonchalantly refers to him as the person who is going to kill her.|$|E

60|$|But Polly knew better. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind's</b> eye she {{saw those}} fingers, {{rendered}} doubly nervous by the fearful cerebral excitement, grasping at first mechanically, even thoughtlessly, {{a bit of}} twine with which to secure the window; then the ruling habit strongest through all, the girl could see it; the lean and ingenious fingers fidgeting, fidgeting with that piece of string, tying knot after knot, more wonderful, more complicated, than any she had yet witnessed.|$|R
60|$|Mark {{had evidently}} some ideas of art, and was besides {{inclined}} {{to do the}} honours to the stranger; but Nuttie {{was not going to}} encourage him or anybody else to make up to her, while she had that look of Gerard Godfrey's <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind's</b> eye. So she made small answer, and he felt rebuffed, but supposed her shy, and wondered when he could go back to her mother, who was so much more attractive.|$|R
500|$|Robinson {{went on to}} earn her Juris Doctor (J.D.) {{degree from}} Harvard Law School in 1988. By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her {{confidence}} had grown; [...] "This time around, {{there was no doubt}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> that she had earned her place". Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, who has said that she had answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law, of whether she would remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton, believing that she concluded she could be [...] "both brilliant and black." ...|$|E
500|$|Balzac {{returned}} to Wierzchownia in October, and immediately fell ill with heart issues. His condition deteriorated throughout 1849, and doubts persisted <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> about their union. Biographers generally agree that Hańska was convinced by Balzac's frail state and endless devotion. One wrote: [...] "It was charity, {{as much as}} love or fame, which finally turned the scale." [...] Robb indicates that the wedding was [...] "surely an act of compassion on her part". To avoid rumors and suspicion from the Tsar, Hańska transferred ownership of the estate to her daughter. On 14 March 1850 they traveled to Berdychiv and, accompanied by Anna and Jerzy, were married in a small ceremony at the parish church of St. Barbara.|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Picto was Lady Dudley's maid and Thomas Blount {{asked whether}} she thought what had {{happened}} was [...] "chance or villany": she said by her faith she doth judge very chance, and neither done by man nor by herself. For herself, she said, she was a good virtuous gentlewoman, and daily would pray upon her knees; and divers times she saith that she hath heard her pray to God to deliver her from desperation. Then, said I, she might have an evil toy [...] <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> No, good Mr. Blount, said Picto, do not judge so of my words; if you should so gather, I am sorry I said so much.|$|E
6000|$|Nasha {{was deep}} <b>in</b> thought, <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> far away. Suddenly she gasped. [...] "Dorle," [...] she said. [...] "What's {{the matter with}} us? We have no problem. The gun is no menace at all." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him <b>in</b> silence, <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> filled with the {{confused}} struggle between her passion and her reason. He allured her, this grave and stern outlaw, appealing to some primitive longing within her.|$|R
