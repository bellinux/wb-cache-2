25|$|Cellulose {{production}} depends {{heavily on}} several {{factors such as}} the growth medium, environmental conditions, and the formation of byproducts. The fermentation medium contains carbon, nitrogen, and other macro and micro nutrients required for bacteria growth. Bacteria are most efficient when supplied with an abundant carbon source and minimal nitrogen source. Glucose and sucrose are the most commonly used carbon sources for cellulose production, while fructose, maltose, xylose, starch, and glycerol have been tried. Sometimes, ethanol may be used to increase cellulose production. The problem with using glucose is that gluconic acid is formed as a byproduct which decreases the pH of the culture and in turn, decreases the production of cellulose. Studies have shown that gluconic acid production can be decreased in the presence of lignosulfonate. Addition of organic acids, specifically acetic acid, also helped in a higher yield of cellulose. Studies of using molasses medium in a jar <b>fermentor</b> as well as added components of sugarcane molasses on certain strains of bacteria have been studied with results showing increases in cellulose production.|$|E

40|$|A 9145 is a basic, water-soluble, {{antifungal}} antibiotic {{which is}} produced in a complex organic medium by Streptomyces griseolus. The metabolite has a molecular weight of 510, and contains adenine as well as sugar hydroxyl and amino groups. Although glucose, fructose, glucose polymers, and some long-chain fatty acid methyl esters supported biosynthesis, oils were superior, with cottonseed oil being preferred. Several ions and salts, especially Co 2 +, PO 43 −, and CaCO 3, were stimulatory. Adenine, nucleosides, and some amino acids increased the accumulation of A 9145 in shaken-flask <b>fermentors.</b> Enrichment of the culture medium with tyrosine afforded maximal enhancement of antibiotic production in both flask and tank <b>fermentors.</b> Control of the dissolved O 2 level was also critical, the optimal concentration being 3 × 10 − 2 to 4. 5 × 10 − 2 μmole of O 2 /ml.

50|$|Microbial {{inoculants}} are {{addition of}} microbes into {{a plant that}} would essentially help the plant grow by introducing nutrients, and stimulating plant growth. The preparation in mass quantities of any inoculum is performed by a process called fermentation. The first step to making it is by selecting a microbial strain, and letting it grow and increase in bacterial concentration. The greater the bacterial concentration the greater the fermentation yield would be (fermentation yield is ratio of bacterial concentration to mass of substrate) The bacterial concentration can be measured by monitoring the turbidity, wet or dry weight, or residual nutrient concentration. After the inoculant is ready then it gets transferred in a <b>fermentor</b> where oxygen and temperature most be highly monitored {{for the survival of}} the microbes and it can vary depending on the microbe that is being used. After enough time has passed for the microbes to be properly incubated the product is ready to be extracted purified and packaged.|$|E
50|$|One {{perennial}} tale {{held that}} because of a massive accident involving deadly biological agents, the government could never be entirely sure that the building was safe to occupy and therefore it was closed and sealed up. It had to be left standing because officials couldn't be sure the bacteria were truly gone. In fact, a large spill did occur in Building 470 in 1958. A technician, trying to pry open a stuck valve {{at the bottom of}} a <b>fermentor,</b> unintentionally released approximately 2,000 gallons of liquid B. anthracis culture. Because of the design of the building and the safety measures in place, it was possible to isolate the spill to one room. There was no contamination of Fort Detrick or the local community, and no one (including the technician) became ill. The outcome of the incident was taken to indicate the effectiveness of the biological safety practices pioneered during the early days of “bioweaponeering” at Fort Detrick.|$|E
