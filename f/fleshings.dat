[...] "Mr. Sharp, the manager, wants a lot of tallish girls, and I told him I knew of a perfect dear. He said: 'Bring her on, then,' and I flew home to tell you. Now, don't look wild, and say no. You've only got to sing in one chorus, march in the grand procession, and lead your band in the terrific battle-scene. The dress is splendid!

Mr. Mellaire is always full-garmented, but Mr. Pike, on these delicious nights, stands his first watch after midnight in his pyjamas. He is a fearfully muscular man. Sixty-nine years seem impossible when I see his single, slimpsy garments pressed like <b>fleshings</b> against his form and bulged by heavy bone and huge muscle. A splendid figure of a man! What {{he must have been}} in the hey-day of youth two score years and more ago passes comprehension.|$|E
60|$|Monsieur Leon Berthelini had a {{great care}} of his appearance, and sedulously suited his deportment to the costume of the hour. He {{affected}} something Spanish in his air, and something of the bandit, with a flavour of Rembrandt at home. In person he was decidedly small and inclined to be stout; his face was the picture of good humour; his dark eyes, which were very expressive, told of a kind heart, a brisk, merry nature, and the most indefatigable spirits. If he had worn the clothes of the period you would have set him down for a hitherto undiscovered hybrid between the barber, the innkeeper, and the affable dispensing chemist. But in the outrageous bravery of velvet jacket and flapped hat, with trousers that were more accurately described as <b>fleshings,</b> a white handkerchief cavalierly knotted at his neck, a shock of Olympian curls upon his brow, and his feet shod through all weathers in the slenderest of Moliere shoes - you had but {{to look at him}} and you knew you were {{in the presence of a}} Great Creature. When he wore an overcoat he scorned to pass the sleeves; a single button held it round his shoulders; it was tossed backwards after the manner of a cloak, and carried with the gait and presence of an Almaviva. I am of opinion that M. Berthelini was nearing forty. But he had a boy's heart, gloried in his finery, and walked through life like a child in a perpetual dramatic performance. If he were not Almaviva after all, it was not for lack of making believe. And he enjoyed the artist's compensation. If he were not really Almaviva, he was sometimes just as happy as though he were.|$|E
6000|$|Intenser {{than these}} vague shades {{meanwhile}} is my {{vision of the}} halls of Ferrero--where the orgy of the senses and even the riot of the mind, of which I have just spoken, must quite literally have led me more of a dance than anywhere. Let this sketch of a lost order note withal that under so scant a general provision for infant exercise, as distinguished from infant ease, our hopping and sliding in tune had to be deemed urgent. It was the sense for this form of relief that clearly was general, superseding as the ampler Ferrero scene did previous limited exhibitions; even those, for that matter, coming back {{to me in the}} ancient person of M. Charriau--I guess at the writing of his name--whom I work in but confusedly as a professional visitor, a subject gaped at across a gulf of fear, in one of our huddled schools; all the more that I perfectly evoke him as resembling, with a difference or two, the portraits of the aged Voltaire, and that he had, fiddle in hand and jarret tendu, incited the young agility of our mother and aunt. Edward Ferrero was another matter; in the prime of life, good-looking, romantic and moustachio'd, he was suddenly to figure, on the outbreak of the Civil War, as a General of volunteers--very much {{as if he had been}} one of Bonaparte's improvised young marshals; in anticipation of which, however, he wasn't at all fierce or superior, to my remembrance, but most kind to sprawling youth, in a charming man of the world fashion and as if we wanted but a touch to become also men of the world. Remarkably good-looking, as I say, by the measure of that period, and extraordinarily agile--he could so gracefully leap and bound that his bounding into the military saddle, such occasion offering, had all the felicity, and only wanted the pink <b>fleshings,</b> of the circus--he was still more admired by the mothers, with whom he had to my eyes a most elegant relation, than by the pupils; among all of whom, at the frequent and delightful soirées, he caused trays laden with lucent syrups repeatedly to circulate. The scale of these entertainments, as I figured it, and the florid frescoes, just damp though they were with newness, and the free lemonade, and the freedom of remark, equally great, with the mothers, were the lavish note in him--just as the fact that he never himself fiddled, but was followed, over the shining parquet, by attendant fiddlers, represented doubtless a shadow the less on his later dignity, so far as that dignity was compassed. Dignity marked in full measure even at the time the presence of his sister Madame Dubreuil, a handsome authoritative person who instructed us equally, in fact preponderantly, and who, though comparatively not sympathetic, so engaged, physiognomically, my wondering interest, that I hear to this hour her shrill Franco-American accent: [...] "Don't look at me, little boy--look at my feet." [...] I see them now, these somewhat fat members, beneath the uplifted skirt, encased in [...] "bronzed" [...] slippers, without heels but attached, by graceful cross-bands over her white stockings, to her solid ankles--an emphatic sign of the time; not less than I recover my surprised sense of their supporting her without loss of balance, substantial as she was, in the [...] "first position"; her command of which, her ankles clapped close together and her body very erect, was so perfect that even with her toes, right and left, fairly turning the corner backward, she never fell prone on her face.|$|E
6000|$|I am fond of quoting {{this passage}} from La Bruyère, because {{the subject is}} one where I like to show a Frenchman on my side, to save my sentiments from being set down to my {{peculiar}} dulness and deficient sense of the ludicrous, and also that they may profit by that enhancement of ideas when presented in a foreign tongue, that glamour of unfamiliarity conferring a dignity on the foreign names of very common things, of which even a philosopher like Dugald Stewart confesses the influence. I remember hearing a fervid woman attempt to recite in English the narrative of a begging Frenchman who described the violent {{death of his father}} in the July days. The narrative had impressed her, through the mists of her flushed anxiety to understand it, as something quite grandly pathetic; but finding the facts turn out meagre, and her audience cold, she broke off, saying, [...] "It sounded so much finer in French--j'ai vu le sang de mon père, and so on--I wish I could repeat it in French." [...] This was a pardonable illusion in an old-fashioned lady who had not received the polyglot education of the present day; but I observe that even now much nonsense and bad taste win admiring acceptance solely by virtue of the French language, and one may fairly desire that what seems a just discrimination should profit by the fashionable prejudice in favour of La Bruyère's idiom. But I wish he had added that the habit of dragging the ludicrous into topics where the chief interest is of a different or even opposite kind is a sign not of endowment, but of deficiency. The art of spoiling is within reach of the dullest faculty: the coarsest clown with a hammer in his hand might chip the nose off every statue and bust in the Vatican, and stand grinning at the effect of his work. Because wit is an exquisite product of high powers, we are not therefore forced to admit the sadly confused inference of the monotonous jester that he is establishing his superiority over every less facetious person, and over every topic on which he is ignorant or insensible, by being uneasy until he has distorted it in the small cracked mirror which he carries about with him as a joking apparatus. Some high authority is needed to give many worthy and timid persons the freedom of muscular repose under the growing demand on them to laugh when they have no other reason than the peril of being taken for dullards; still more to inspire them with the courage to say that they object to the theatrical spoiling for themselves and their children of all affecting themes, all the grander deeds and aims of men, by burlesque associations adapted to the taste of rich fishmongers in the stalls and their assistants in the gallery. The English people in the present generation are falsely reputed to know Shakspere (as, by some innocent persons, the Florentine mule-drivers are believed to have known the Divina Commedia, not, perhaps, excluding all the subtle discourses in the Purgatorio and Paradiso); but there seems a clear prospect that in the coming generation he will be known to them through burlesques, and that his plays will find a new life as pantomimes. A bottle-nosed Lear will come on with a monstrous corpulence from which he will frantically dance himself free during the midnight storm; Rosalind and Celia will join in a grotesque ballet with shepherds and shepherdesses; Ophelia in <b>fleshings</b> and a voluminous brevity of grenadine will dance through the mad scene, finishing with the famous [...] "attitude of the scissors" [...] in the arms of Laertes; and all the speeches in [...] "Hamlet" [...] will be so ingeniously parodied that the originals will be reduced to a mere memoria technica of the improver's puns--premonitory signs of a hideous millennium, in which the lion will have to lie down with the lascivious monkeys whom (if we may trust Pliny) his soul naturally abhors.|$|E
40|$|Animal <b>fleshings</b> {{represent}} {{more than}} 50 % {{of the total}} waste generated by the leather industry. Generally, the <b>fleshings</b> represent undesirable waste the elimination of which is often connected with expenses. However, this waste contains valuable protein and fat fractions. For this reason, a complex procedure for separation and utilization of both fractions was suggested. The method involves sodium chloride removal with subsequent protein and fat separation. The proposed desalting operation facilitated significant reduction of ash content and consequently the obtained protein fraction has acceptable properties for commercial application. A mathematical model of this process was worked out. The model enables to find the optimal conditions at which the practical desalting should be carried out. The obtained fat is deacidified and the resulting quality product is suitable for direct biodiesel production. The analyses of the prepared biodiesel confirmed high conversion of transesterification reaction and thus optimal purity of the feedstock. Even the sulfur content which could {{be an issue in}} <b>fleshings</b> utilization for biodiesel production was low enough to meet the biodiesel standard of quality EN 14 214...|$|E
40|$|Diffusion {{of sodium}} {{chloride}} plays {{key role in}} the pre-tanning treatment of raw hides, namely in the brine curing and soaking operations. Understanding the transport processes related to these operations gives ground for their optimization and thus to reduction of the adverse environmental impact as well as minimization of the consumption of sodium chloride, water and energies. Mathematical model of raw hide curing is presented and its modification for spherical coordinates applied on the description of the desalting of <b>fleshings,</b> a cheap raw material for the production of biodiesel and high quality gelatin. Desalting is the key step in the <b>fleshings</b> complex processing {{and the quality of the}} resulting products is highly dependent on the precise performance of the desalting operation. The experimental part includes determination of the effective diffusion coefficient of NaCl during brine curing on model porous material using color indication of the border area, determination of the diffusion coefficient of NaCl in the inner volume of fleshing during desalting, and pilot scale testing of the efficiency of <b>fleshings</b> desalting. The obtained diffusion coefficients were compared with the theoretical value at infinite dilution and factors affecting the diffusion coefficient values were discussed...|$|E
40|$|The tanning {{industry}} generates a high quantity of solid wastes. Therefore, {{there is a}} need to create valorization [added value] options for these wastes. The main objective of the present work was to study the effect of protein hydrolysates (HP) prepared from <b>fleshings</b> on leather dyeing. During previous studies it was found that the application of HP products, obtained from <b>fleshings,</b> in leather retannage intensified the colour of crust leather. In this work the CIELAB colour system was used to evaluate the effect of HP on retannage processes. The main conclusions of this study were: (i) HP can be used instead of a dicyanodiamide resin (Fortan DC) if the colour parameters of the standard procedure are to be maintained, and (ii) the replacement of an acrylic resin (Fortan A 40) by glutaraldehyde-modified HP (GHP) results in a darker skin, and can therefore be interesting for the reduction of the quantity of dye used...|$|E
40|$|The leather {{industry}} generates waste either in solid or liquid form. Fleshing, which is {{integral part of}} a hide, is removed during leather processing as it is an unwanted material in the final product. For every ton of leather processed, about 100 - 150 kg of fleshing is generated. An alternative to disposal of these wastes is to reuse them. In this study, an experimental activity research for assessing the feasibility of the reuse of the collagen hydrolizate in the retanning/dyeing/fatliquoring phase was performed. The hydrolyzed collagen, in liquid form, is obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of <b>fleshings.</b> The hydrolizate has been used both in a vegetablechrome retannage/dyeing/fatliquoring and in a vegetable retannage/dyeing/fatliquoring to obtain bovine upper leather. Both in a vegetable-chrome retannage and in a vegetable retannage, the final leathers showed similar properties in terms of physical and technical properties to conventionally processed hides. The results obtained indicate {{that the use of}} the collagen hydrolizate in the retanning/dyeing/fatliquoring phase as an interesting route for recovering the <b>fleshings...</b>|$|E
40|$|During {{raw hide}} processing, tanning {{industries}} generate {{large quantities of}} wastes containing {{a considerable amount of}} fat which can be converted into biodiesel. A typical representative of such wastes is <b>fleshings</b> - which however, usually contains a significant amount of free fatty acids, proteins and other impurities. Pretreatment was suggested as a means of processing this acidic feedstock, thereby enabling the reduction of the free fatty acid content under the limit value of 0. 5 % w/w when the alkali catalyst is then appropriate for transesterification. The feedstock pretreatment process involved the refining melting of fresh pigskin <b>fleshings</b> with subsequent extraction using a methanol or methanol solution with an equimolar amount of alkali i. e. tetramethylammonium hydroxide, isopropylamine and cyclohexylamine. A mathematical model of the pretreatment process was proposed, verified and used in further simulation calculations - which confirmed that deacidification employing methanolic alkali solutions is more efficient than pretreatment with pure methanol; in addition, the free fatty acids can be removed to the demanded level in just one step (fat initial acid value = 20 mg KOH/g, mass ratio of methanol to oil = 1. 5). The fat pretreated by the suggested procedure was used for alkali catalyzed transesterification. The prepared biodiesel met most of the EN 14 214 requirements with respect to the limitations caused by the used <b>fleshings</b> fatty acid profile.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to recover the fat from fleshing in order it could be useful for many kinds of industries such as soap, oil/grease for tanning manufactures, etc. There are some systems to recover the fat from <b>fleshings,</b> those are heat systems (cooking, steaming, smoking) and extrac system using solvent (hexan, CCl 4, alcohol, etc). Over all of the systems cooking and steaming are the most simply system to recover the fat. By cooking, smoking, and steaming from 5 kg fleshing with the time variation of 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes could produce fat with the quantity of which varied from 0, 220 – 0, 425 kg.
