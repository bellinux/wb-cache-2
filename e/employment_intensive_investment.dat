40|$|As {{sustainable}} employment {{is one of}} the best routes out of poverty, assistance in designing and implementing strategies and programmes for job creation can contribute to the objective of poverty alleviation in situations of low income and high unemployment and underemployment. The challenge of poverty reduction is made tougher by crises of some form or the other (e. g., those resulting from economic turmoil, armed conflicts or natural calamities) which tend to aggravate the poverty situation. Special attention, therefore, needs to be devoted to countries emerging from crises of various types. The Recovery and Reconstruction Department (EMP/RECON) of the International Labour Office has the dual function of (i) responding to the reconstruction and rehabilitation needs in various post-crisis situations, and (ii) contributing to an employment-focussed development agenda by providing direct assistance in the creation of poverty-reducing jobs. The first function is undertaken through the InFocus Programme on Crisis Response and Reconstruction which assists in formulating and implementing employment-focussed reconstruction programmes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze whether the employment/productivity profile of growth {{as well as}} its sectoral pattern matter for poverty reduction. We also {{identify}} some conditions of the labor market which are associated with <b>employment</b> <b>intensive</b> growth or specific sectoral growth. We find that, in the short run, while the overall employment intensity of growth does not matter for poverty reduction, the sectoral pattern of employment growth and productivity growth is important. While <b>employment</b> <b>intensive</b> growth in the secondary sector appears to be associated with decreases in poverty, <b>employment</b> <b>intensive</b> growth in agriculture increases poverty. Similarly productivity intensive growth in agriculture is associated with poverty reduction. The results suggest that focusing on the aggregate employment elasticity of growth, alone, as a way to reduce poverty may lead to misleading policy recommendations and more be gained by focusing on secondary sector employment growth and productivity intensive growth in agriculture. 1 Poverty Reduction Group, World Ban...|$|R

The gendered nature of this growthemployment nexus is examined by analyzing the differential impacts that {{macroeconomic policies}} and structures have on growth’s employment intensity by gender for 80 countries from 1990 - 2012. Such an understanding is of particular relevance to policymakers concerned with the linkages between growth and human development, as {{the question of whether the}} benefits of economic growth are broadly shared is one that centers on the capacity of economies to generate high-quality employment.

40|$|Firm {{spending}} on innovation and marketing, {{as measured by}} research and development (R&D) and advertising expenses, respectively, are expected to yield positive returns in terms of share price performance. Given resource limitations, firms prioritize the quantum of their investments in R&D and advertising vis-à-vis other investments. We {{examine the relationship between}} firm performance and the intensity of their investments in R&D and advertising over an extended period covering 40 years and 15039 firm-years. Our findings are consistent with the resource-based literature. Specifically, we find that <b>intensive</b> <b>investment</b> in R&D contributes positively to the one-year stock market performances of manufacturing firms but not for nonmanufacturing firms. We also find that <b>intensive</b> <b>investment</b> in advertising contributes positively to the one-year stock market performances of nonmanufacturing firms. For the three-year stock market performance, in addition to the findings of the one-year period, we find inconclusive evidence that manufacturing firms benefit from investment in advertising. The interactions of R&D and advertising intensities are insignificant in explaining the stock market performance of the firms except for the three-year horizon for nonmanufacturing firms, which is significantly negative. Consistent with the resource-based literature, this implies that firm performances are diluted when they invest their resources in activities outside their core competence. © 2005 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|We study a two-sector OLG {{economy in}} which a share of old age {{consumption}} expenditures must be paid out of money balances and we appraise its dynamic features. We first show that competitive equilibrium is dynamically efficient {{if and only if}} the share of capital on total income is large enough while a steady state capital per capita above its Golden Rule level is not consistent with a binding liquidity constraint. We thus focus on the gross substitutability in consumption and on dynamic efficiency assumptions and show that, gathered together, they ensure the local determinacy of equilibrium and, as a consequence, rule out sunspot fluctuations. In addition, we prove that the unique steady state may change its stability from a saddle configuration to a source one (undergoing a flip bifurcation) for a capital <b>intensive</b> <b>investment</b> good as well as for a capital intensive consumption good, when the elasticity of the interest rate is set low enough. However, when the investment good is not too capital intensive, the flip bifurcation turns out to be compatible with high elasticities of the interest rate too. Analogous results within dynamic efficiency are found in the non-monetary model, the existence of a flip bifurcation requiring now a capital <b>intensive</b> <b>investment</b> good. Eventually, under dynamic inefficiency, in the non-monetary economy local indeterminacy may instead appear, either through a Hopf bifurcation or through a flip one, and its scope improves as soon as the consumption good becomes more and more capital intensive...|$|R
