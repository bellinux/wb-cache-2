40|$|Abstract. Shocks {{are often}} {{simulated}} using the classical molecular dynamics (MD) method {{in which the}} electrons are not included explicitly and the interatomic interaction is described by an effective potential. As a result, the fast <b>electronic</b> <b>heat</b> conduction in metals and the coupling between the lattice vibrations and the electronic degrees of freedom can not be represented. Under conditions of steep temperature gradients that can form near the shock front, however, the <b>electronic</b> <b>heat</b> conduction {{can play an important}} part in redistribution of the thermal energy in the shocked target. We present the first atomistic simulation of a shock propagation including the <b>electronic</b> <b>heat</b> conduction and electronphonon coupling. The computational model is based on the two-temperature model (TTM) that describes the time evolution of the lattice and electron temperatures by two coupled non-linear differential equations. In the combined TTM-MD method, MD substitutes the TTM equation for the lattice temperature. Simulations are performed with both MD and TTM-MD models for an EAM Al target shocked at 300 kbar. The target includes a tilt grain boundary, which provides a region where shock heating is more pronounced and, therefore, the effect of the <b>electronic</b> <b>heat</b> conduction is expected to be more important. We find that the differences between the predictions of the MD and TTM-MD simulations are significantly smaller as compared to the hydrodynamics calculations performed at similar conditions with and without <b>electronic</b> <b>heat</b> conduction...|$|R

Then, we tested the validity of the free electron approaches, varying the number of free electrons per atom. This shows that only simple metals can be correctly fitted with these approaches.

Testing water samples for Escherichia coli (E. coli) allows EWB to determine water contamination levels. This {{is an important part}} of identifying an adequate source for a water system. E. coli testing is performed by culturing water samples in a constant temperature incubator for twenty-four hours and then manually counting the E. coli cultures. This poster describes the development of a self-contained heating method for a portable incubator. Two methods for heating the incubator are evaluated. The first utilizes the heat energy released during the phase transition of a phase change material (PCM) and the second uses <b>electronic</b> <b>heating</b> elements. A phase change material that changes state at the desired incubation temperature combined with proper insulation is capable of heating an incubator for the twenty-four hour test period.
