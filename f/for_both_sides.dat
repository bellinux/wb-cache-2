5|$|Hostilities {{began in}} October 1632 when Russian forces tried {{to capture the}} city of Smolensk. Small {{military}} engagements produced mixed results <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> but the surrender of the main Russian force in February 1634 led to the Treaty of Polyanovka. Russia accepted Polish-Lithuanian control over the Smolensk region, which lasted for another 20years.|$|E
5|$|The Union {{army had}} {{occupied}} strong defensive positions, and Meade handled his forces well, resulting in heavy losses <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> but leaving {{the disposition of}} forces on both sides essentially unchanged.

5|$|The {{plan for}} the battle was {{straightforward}} <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides.</b> The Russians wanted {{to break through the}} Polish defences to Warsaw, while the Polish aim was to defend the area long enough for a two-pronged counteroffensive from the south, led by General Józef Piłsudski, and north, led by General Władysław Sikorski, to outflank the attacking forces.|$|E
5|$|A later {{attempt by}} the Canadian Corps to extend its {{position}} into the city of Lens failed but the German and Canadian assessments of the battle concluded that it succeeded in its attrition objective. The battle was costly <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> and many casualties were suffered from extensive use of poison gas, including the new German Yellow Cross shell containing the blistering agent sulfur mustard (mustard gas).|$|E
5|$|Although {{casualties}} appeared even {{in numbers}} <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> the Austrians fielded a significantly larger fighting force of nearly 55,000at Ostrach, with another 60,000stretched along {{a line between}} Lake Constance and Ulm. French casualties amounted to more than 12percent of their force, and Austrian, approximately four percent. The French were forced back to Stockach, where on 25March the armies engaged again, this time with greater losses on both sides, and a decisive Austrian victory.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} day of the Battle of Gettysburg (July 2, 1863) Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee {{attempted}} to capitalize on his first day's success. He launched the Army of Northern Virginia in multiple attacks on the flanks of the Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. The assaults were unsuccessful, and resulted in heavy casualties <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|E
5|$|Film records survive of two Gettysburg reunions, {{held on the}} battlefield.

This was recorded on sound film, and some Confederates can be heard giving the Rebel Yell.|$|E

5|$|Poor {{organization}} {{among both}} North and South Korean units made {{it extremely difficult}} to estimate total casualties <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides.</b> Several units were completely destroyed in the fighting, making precise casualty counting difficult. A memo from the South Korean army claimed 3,800 North Korean killed and 181 captured in the P'ohang area from 17 August onward. However, casualty numbers are likely far higher. The NK 12th Division alone likely suffered at least 4,500 casualties {{on top of that}} number, reporting a strength of 6,000 on 5 August and only 1,500 on 17 August.|$|E
5|$|Stretching {{between the}} Pfullendorf heights {{and the village}} lies a flat, wide plain, marshy in places, ringed with low-lying hills, and creased with a small {{tributary}} stream from which the village takes its name. Ostrach itself lies almost at {{the northern end of}} this plain, but slightly south of the Danube itself. By 7March, the first French forces arrived there, and the Austrians arrived a day or so later. Over the following week, additional forces <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> arrived, and the two armies faced each other across this valley.|$|E

5|$|The 1927 Football Association Charity Shield was the 14th FA Charity Shield, {{an annual}} English {{association}} football match.

5|$|The JNA {{responded by}} {{launching}} a major offensive in eastern Slavonia, {{from where it}} intended to progress west via Vinkovci and Osijek to Zagreb. The army did not bypass Vukovar, because they wished to relieve the besieged barracks and to eliminate a possible threat to their supply lines. The JNA leadership {{did not intend to}} make Vukovar the main focus of the offensive but, as happened with Stalingrad in the Second World War, an initially inconsequential engagement became an essential political symbol <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|E

The average infantryman may have had his uniform made for him in Richmond, Virginia, however, the man enlisted in Georgia, and is now marching through the former state. In reflection to his loyalties to home, this man, for example, could have adorned his uniform with Georgia State buttons. This would indicate to his fellow soldiers his allegiance to both his state and his military unit. This was common practice during the war <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> in the conflict.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Proton {{transfer}} reactions play {{an important}} role in many areas of biology. We reimplemented a method introduced by Taraphder et al. to characterize putative proton transfer pathways in proteins along hydrogen bonded networks and could re-trace their results on cytochrome P 450 cam. By combining this method with our es-tablished Q-HOP approach to compute proton transfer probabilities we present here to our best knowledge for the first time a general program package to characterize pro-ton transfer pathways in biomolecules accounting <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>side</b> chain flexibility and transfer kinetics. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{engagement}} was confusing <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> and {{the view}} was soon obscured by gunpowder smoke. Many ships on both sides were badly damaged, and around 2,000 men killed or wounded. Towards the end, a squadron of Danish ships met up with Dutch and escorted them into the harbor of Copenhagen. The Swedish fleet had failed; much-needed reinforcements and supplies had reached the beleaguered Danish town. The combined Danish and Dutch fleet now had control of the seas, forcing the Swedish fleet to seek refuge in the harbor of Landskrona on the Swedish mainland.|$|E
5|$|The terrain {{complicated}} battle tactics <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> but the Russians and the Austrians, having {{arrived in}} the area first, were able to overcome many of its difficulties by strengthening a causeway between two small ponds. They had also devised a solution to Frederick's deadly modus operandi, the oblique order. Although Frederick's troops initially gained {{the upper hand in}} the battle, the sheer number of Allied troops gave the Russians and Austrians an advantage. By afternoon, when the combatants were exhausted, fresh Austrian troops thrown into the fray secured the Allied victory.|$|E
5|$|The two armies {{suffered}} between 46,000 and 51,000 casualties. Union {{casualties were}} 23,055 (3,155 killed, 14,531 wounded, 5,369 captured or missing), while Confederate casualties {{are more difficult}} to estimate. Many authors have referred to as many as 28,000 Confederate casualties, and Busey and Martin's more recent 2005 work, Regimental Strengths and Losses at Gettysburg, documents 23,231 (4,708 killed, 12,693 wounded, 5,830 captured or missing). Nearly a third of Lee's general officers were killed, wounded, or captured. The casualties <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> during the entire campaign were 57,225.|$|E
