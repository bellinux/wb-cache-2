The <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> constraint is modelled as a linear combination of even-moment statistics {{of the channel}} input being larger than a threshold. It is shown that the {{capacity of}} an AWGN channel under transmit average <b>power</b> and receiver <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> constraints {{is the same as}} the capacity of an AWGN channel under an average power constraint, however, depending on the two constraints, it can be either achieved or arbitrarily approached. It is also shown that under average <b>power,</b> amplitude and <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> constraints, the optimal capacity achieving distributions are discrete with a finite number of mass points. To establish the results, the confluent hypergeometric functions as well as the output rate of decay of complex Gaussian channels are utilized extensively. As an application, a simultaneous information and power transfer (SWIPT) problem is studied, where an experimentally-validated nonlinear model of the harvester is used. Relying on small signal analysis approximation, a general form of the <b>delivered</b> Direct-Current (DC) <b>power</b> in terms of system baseband parameters is derived for independent and identically distributed (iid) inputs.
