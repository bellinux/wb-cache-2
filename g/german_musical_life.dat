500|$|Not all {{reaction}} to Wagner was positive. For a time, <b>German</b> <b>musical</b> <b>life</b> {{divided into two}} factions, supporters of Wagner and supporters of Johannes Brahms; the latter, {{with the support of}} the powerful critic Eduard Hanslick (of whom Beckmesser in Meistersinger is in part a caricature) championed traditional forms and led the conservative front against Wagnerian innovations. They were supported by the conservative leanings of some German music schools, including the conservatories at Leipzig under Ignaz Moscheles and at Cologne under the direction of Ferdinand Hiller. Another Wagner detractor was the French composer Charles-Valentin Alkan, who wrote to Hiller after attending Wagner's Paris concert on 25 January 1860 at which Wagner conducted the overtures to Der fliegende Holländer and Tannhäuser, the preludes to Lohengrin and Tristan und Isolde, and six other extracts from Tannhäuser and Lohengrin: [...] "I had imagined that I was going to meet music of an innovative kind but was astonished to find a pale imitation of Berlioz... I do not like all the music of Berlioz while appreciating his marvellous understanding of certain instrumental effects... but here he was imitated and caricatured... Wagner is not a musician, he is a disease." ...|$|E

Among the circle of influential German composers and critics he was never accepted as a real avant-gardist, because his advancement of the dodecaphony was unorthodox and beside all contemporary aspects always kept references to tradition.|$|E

5000|$|This triumph {{happened}} {{on the eve of}} the Nazi takeover of Germany, which quickly destroyed Goldschmidt's livelihood. Like many Jewish composers (and other composers considered subversive of the Germanic purity of the Third Reich), Goldschmidt had his work condemned as [...] "degenerate music" [...] by the regime. There was no place in <b>German</b> <b>musical</b> <b>life</b> for Goldschmidt since performances of his work were banned and he was barred from conducting orchestras. Goldschmidt resorted to earning a living by giving piano lessons, before finally leaving the country on the advice of an SS officer and emigrating to England in 1935.|$|E

In addition he guest-conducted the Berlin Philharmonic occasionally, and from 1927 was co-conductor of the Essen Folkwangschule. In 1929 he married for the second time and in 1934 gave up his position in Essen, returning once more to Berlin where he conducted the Berlin Radio Orchestra, {{as well as that of}} Hamburg. During 1939 he made a series of farewell appearances in Berlin and Essen, but towards the end of the year he became fatally ill, dying in Stockholm, Sweden just a few weeks short of his eightieth birthday.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1933, after Adolf Hitler {{had become}} Chancellor of the [...] "Deutsche Reich", the ADMV was {{attacked}} by the National Socialists. During the Tonkünstler-Fest, now being called Tonkünstler-Versammlung again, of that year in Dortmund, the [...] "Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda" [...] (Ministry for the Enlightening of the People and Propaganda) of Joseph Goebbels made known that a reorganization of cultural life had to take place. In November 1933, as part of Goebbels' Ministry, a Reichsmusikkammer ("Imperial Music Chamber"), directed by Richard Strauss, was installed, responsible for all parts of <b>German</b> <b>musical</b> <b>life.</b> In July 1935 Strauss had to resign due to his collaboration with Jewish artists, especially with Stefan Zweig, librettist of the opera Die schweigsame Frau.

50|$|After {{the fall}} of Hitler, Hartmann {{was one of the}} few {{prominent}} surviving anti-fascists in Bavaria whom the postwar Allied administration could appoint to a position of responsibility. In 1945, he became a dramaturge at the Bavarian State Opera and there, as one of the few internationally recognized figures who had survived untainted by any collaboration with the Nazi regime, he became a vital figure in the rebuilding of (West) <b>German</b> <b>musical</b> <b>life.</b> Perhaps his most notable achievement was the Musica Viva concert series, which he founded and ran for the rest of his life in Munich. Beginning in November 1945, the concerts reintroduced the German public to 20th-century repertoire, which had been banned since 1933 under National Socialist aesthetic policy. Hartmann also provided a platform for the music of the young composers who came to the fore in the late 1940s and early 1950s, helping to establish such figures as Hans Werner Henze, Luigi Nono, Luigi Dallapiccola, Carl Orff, Iannis Xenakis, Olivier Messiaen, Luciano Berio, Bernd Alois Zimmermann and many others. Hartmann also involved sculptors and artists such as Jean Cocteau, Le Corbusier, and Joan Miró in exhibitions at Musica Viva.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the last}} years of Bronsart's time as {{president}} discontent arose over the repertoire of the concerts at the Tonkünstler-Versammlungen. In 1896, in Leipzig, for example, works by Alessandro Scarlatti, Pietro Antonio Locatelli, Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Friedrich Händel and Friedrich II of Prussia as well as works by Brahms, Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner were performed. The works of historical styles met an increasing interest of that time in music of the Baroque or even earlier periods of music history. Performing these works was in congruence with the statutes of the ADMV. Brahms, Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner, however, were more and more regarded as classics. While their works were still performed, works of the present generation of young composers, with exception of Strauss, were missing. The ADMV hence was accused of confusing an esprit de corps, as installed by Liszt, with interests of a diocese or the conceit of a regiment. Strauss, who did not share the interest in music of historical times, changed the statutes of the ADMV. Its central aim was now cultivating and supporting <b>German</b> <b>musical</b> <b>life</b> in the sense of new developments. The literary department and the paragraphs concerning performances of older works were removed, the Tonkünstler-Versammlungen were renamed as Tonkünstler-Feste (Musicians Festivals), and performances of works of the older [...] "New Germans" [...] were reduced to exceptions. Until World War I, the most frequently performed contemporary composer at the Tonkünstler-Feste was Strauss himself, but there were also works such as Mahler's Symphonies Nos. III and VI, Pfitzner's Overture Das Christ-Elflein, Reger's String Quartet in D minor op.113, The Swan of Tuonela and Lemminkäinen's Return from the Lemminkäinen Suite, Op. 22, of Sibelius, Bartók's Rhapsody Op. 1 for piano and orchestra, and Kodály's String Quartet in C minor.|$|E

5000|$|The humorous, caprice-like song—for alto voice, flute, {{clarinet}} in A, and bassoon—sets an epigrammatic text {{written by}} Strobel, in a French translation by Antoine Goléa ( [...] ; [...] ): On cherche pour trouver quelque chose. Mais au fond, on ne sait pas ce qu’on cherche au juste. Et cela est vrai non seulement pour l’Allemagne musicale.(We {{are seeking to}} find something. But at bottom, {{we do not know}} quite what we are looking for. And that is true not only of <b>German</b> <b>musical</b> <b>life.)</b> The song (in which Stockhausen omits the last five words of the French text) was later published in a memorial volume for Strobel [...] Upon returning to Cologne, Stockhausen resumed work on Gesang der Jünglinge and returned also to Zeitmaße—now scored for flute, oboe, cor anglais, clarinet, and bassoon—completing a first version that was recorded for the radio in December 1955 by the Wind Quintet of the WDR Symphony Orchestra (led by their oboist, Wilhelm Meyer), and first broadcast in January 1956. Stockhausen subsequently nearly doubled the length of the work by inserting five [...] "cadenzas", which became the defining moments of the composition [...] The planned premiere by the WDR Quintet at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse in July 1956 fell through, but Stockhausen brought the score there anyway and showed it to his friends. Pierre Boulez initially dismissed Zeitmaße with a characteristically cutting remark to the effect that Stockhausen would do better to stay in the electronic studio, but soon changed his mind and asked to programme it in Paris on his Domaine Musical concert series. Stockhausen agreed, and the world premiere took place there on 15 December 1956, [...] "before a quiet and extremely attentive audience" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ). Five months later, Boulez included Zeitmaße in a programme taken on tour to London—a performance which was broadcast by the BBC on 6 May 1957—and after returning to Paris made the first recording for commercial release. This recording was made in the composer's presence over a span of eight days in June 1957 ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E
40|$|David Monod's {{engaging}} and thorough monograph offers a largely convincing if at times overstated rebuttal to such negative {{assessments of the}} American role in the musical realm of postwar Germany. Through his focus on cIassical music, he argues that American influence helped to lay the foundations for a new and democratic cultural life. Perhaps most controversially, Monod claims that the modest cultural regeneration of the early postwar years was possible because of the "revolutionary and transformative" power of denazification, the policy to remove Nazi influences from public life (9). While he agrees with most scholars that denazification was implemented poorly and ended too quickly, he nonetheless maintains that American influence was positive in limited but essential ways, through the actions of individual cultural officers {{as well as in}} the structural reform of arts administration. Although many individual initiatives failed, he maintains that the denazification policies-both those designed to remove Nazis from public life as well as those intended to punish and rehabilitate individual Nazis and sympathizers-indeed implemented core democratic values and that, as a result, <b>German</b> <b>musical</b> <b>life</b> changed for the better...|$|E

40|$|Choral {{music has}} always held a {{prominent}} position in American <b>musical</b> <b>life.</b> In the early days, when instruments were scarce, {{the most common}} way for the settlers to express themselves musically was through song. Moreover, the Puritan Fathers forbade musical instruments in church. Since music itself, on the other hand, was granted {{an important role in}} religious life, both as an expression of devotion and as a means of instruction, it flourished mainly in the form of communal (and thus choral) singing. (See also notes for New World Records 80276 - 2, Music of the American Revolution: The Birth of Liberty.) An indication of the importance of vocal music in religious life in early America is found in the singing-school movement, which was initiated by Puritan ministers {{to improve the quality of}} performance during services and which assured that musical instruction was carried out almost exclusively in a vocal context. Also encouraging the development of a vocal tradition in the New World were the close ties with England, where there had long been a strong emphasis on choral music. Finally, the remarkable musical culture that flourished among the Moravians in eighteenth-century Pennsylvania should be mentioned. Here, where <b>musical</b> <b>life</b> was closely aligned to the <b>German</b> <b>musical</b> tradition, one finds the only early American religious compositions with instrumental accompaniment.
