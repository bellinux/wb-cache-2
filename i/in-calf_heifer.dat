3000|$|To {{overcome}} the above consequences, selection and in-situ conservation of indigenous Nguni cattle from rural farming areas is {{possible because of}} the existing within breed genetic variation (Reed, 2008;Scholtz and Theunissen, 2010). By using farmer-preferred traits, this variation offers a room for genetic improvement within the low-input cattle enterprises. Currently, a few institutions in South Africa such as University of Fort Hare (UFH), Industrial Development Cooperation (IDC) and Department of Rural Development and Agrarian Reform (DRDAR) are committed to promote and conserve the low-input indigenous Nguni cattle {{in an effort to}} generate income for farmers and sustainably manage the environment. The institutions established 72 nucleus herds of 10 <b>in-calf</b> <b>heifer</b> and two registered bulls since 2004 in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The enterprises were monitored and expected to give back an equivalent number of animals after five years. It is acknowledged that in low-input systems, the indigenous animals show better performances on functional traits i.e. longevity, draught power, fertility, milk and meat quality (Bayeret al., 2004; Muchenje et al., [...]...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} breeding index (EBI) {{was launched}} in November 2000 as the selection tool for {{the realization of the}} Irish dairy breeding objective. It is derived from the breeding values for three milk production traits namely milk yield, fat yield, protein yield, as well as two functional traits measuring cow fertility (calving interval) and longevity in the herd (survival) each weighted by their respective economic values. The economic values applied in 2001 were derived using the ‘Moorepark Dairy Systems Model ’ (Shalloo et al., 2004) using costs and prices that were current at the time. Since then, there has been significant changes in national and International economic policies affecting dairying. The impact of these changes on costs and prices along with inflation has necessitated a review of the of the economic values used as weights for the various index traits. Regular revision of the economic values is also a norm to avoid the danger of an outdated selection tool. Objectives The specific objectives of the current review were; To re-calculate the cost of replacement heifers based on actual costs of rearing an <b>in-calf</b> <b>heifer</b> to 23 months of ag...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} an AI heifer calf rearing scheme on dairy stock development, in a coconut grazing and a peri-urban smallholder dairy production system in the Western Province of Sri Lanka. The heifer rearing scheme included free advice on calf rearing, drugs, acaricides, minerals and subsidised concentrates for 30 months. The farmers in the coconut growing area integrate dairying with their plantation, they sell their milk to the main processors. The peri-urban farmers are intensive milk producers, who sell their milk at informal markets. To estimate {{the effect of the}} heifer rearing scheme on dairy replacement stock development, scheme farmers were compared with farmers who did not participate in the scheme. Calf mortality was twice as high in non-scheme farms (23 - 28 %) as in scheme farms (12 - 14 %). The scheme had a positive effect on weight development and scheme heifers calved 4. 5 months earlier than non-scheme heifers. The calf rearing package is cost effective in both farming systems, however, the required cash inputs are a major constraint. The costs per <b>in-calf</b> <b>heifer</b> under the scheme are much lower than the production of such animals by either multiplication in state farms or importing them.

40|$|Although {{the effect}} of animal and diet factors on enteric methane (CH 4) {{emissions}} from confined cattle has been extensively examined, less data is available regarding CH 4 emissions from grazing young cattle. A study was undertaken to evaluate {{the effect of}} the physiological state of Holstein-Friesian heifers on their enteric CH 4 emissions while grazing a perennial ryegrass sward. Two experiments were conducted: Experiment 1 ran from May 2011 for 11 weeks and Experiment 2 ran from August 2011 for 10 weeks. In each experiment, Holstein-Friesian heifers were divided into three treatment groups (12 animals/group) consisting of calves, yearling <b>heifers,</b> and <b>in-calf</b> <b>heifers</b> (average ages: 8. 5, 14. 5, and 20. 5 months, respectively). Methane emissions were estimated for each animal in the final week of each experiment using the sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique. Dry matter (DM) intake was estimated using the calculated metabolizable energy (ME) requirement divided by the ME concentration in the grazed grass. As expected, live weight increased with increasing animal age (P < 0. 001); however, {{there was no difference in}} live weight gain among the three groups in Experiment 1, although in Experiment 2, this variable decreased with increasing animal age (P < 0. 001). In Experiment 1, yearling heifers had the highest CH 4 emissions (g·d− 1) and <b>in-calf</b> <b>heifers</b> produced more than calves (P < 0. 001). When expressed as CH 4 emissions per unit of live weight, DM intake, and gross energy (GE) intake, yearling heifers had higher emission rates than calves and <b>in-calf</b> <b>heifers</b> (P < 0. 001). However, the effects on CH 4 emissions were different in Experiment 2, in which CH 4 emissions (g·d− 1) increased linearly with increasing animal age (P < 0. 001), although the difference between yearling and <b>in-calf</b> <b>heifers</b> was not significant. The CH 4 /live weight ratio was lower in <b>in-calf</b> <b>heifers</b> than in the other two groups (P < 0. 001), while CH 4 energy output as a proportion of GE intake was lower in calves than in yearling and <b>in-calf</b> <b>heifers</b> (P < 0. 05). All data were then pooled and used to develop prediction equations for CH 4 emissions. All relationships are significant (P < 0. 001), with R 2 values ranging from 0. 630 to 0. 682. These models indicate that CH 4 emissions could be increased by 0. 252  g·d− 1 with an increase of 1  kg live weight or by 14. 9  g·d− 1 with an increase of 1  kg·d− 1 of DM intake; or, the CH 4 energy output could be increased by 0. 046  MJ·d− 1 with an increase of 1  MJ·d− 1 of GE intake. These results provide an alternative approach for estimating CH 4 emissions from grazing dairy heifers when actual CH 4 emission data are not available...|$|R
40|$|The general aim of {{the present}} work was to compare dairy {{performance}} and some reproductive parameters of Holstein-Friesian (HF) cows imported from Sweden as an <b>in-calf</b> <b>heifers,</b> and their age mates in Poland. The animals were kept freely on the deep litter on the farm owned by Agro-company “Witkowo” and feeding was based on TMR (total mixed ration) system during whole year. All ration’s ingredients (bulky feed, concentrate, miscellaneous additives) were mixed and fed as all-mash. The feed ration depended from the physiological condition of a cow and it was composed of corn and grass ensilage, mash concentrate, crushed corn meal, brewer’s grains and beet pulp. Cows imported from Sweden as <b>in-calf</b> <b>heifers</b> obtained higher milk, fat and protein yield in both lactations comparing to home cows. Significant statistical differences were observed for kg of milk, kg of protein, for FCM (P< 0. 01) and for kg of fat (P< 0. 05) in 2 nd lactation. Fat and protein content in milk was in average higher for home cows (P< 0. 01). Big differences (P< 0. 01) were observed in SBT (proportion of protein to fat content) and RTB (difference between concentration of fat and protein) at imported cows in 2 nd lactation. As far as reproduction parameters (gestation interval, calving interval, insemination index) are concerned was cows from Sweden better too. Heifers from Sweden calved earlier. The usage of high genetic potential of imported cows is possible only with providing them optimum living conditions suitable to their needs...|$|R

The analysis was performed on the basis of data collected from 5284 milkings and derived from computer system of herd management ALPRO provided by DeLaval company. It was determined that parameters of Montbéliarde cows milking were influenced by subsequent lactation and phase after calving and also cow origin. The average milk flow decreased significantly (from 2. 2 to 1. 4 kg·min- 1) along with subsequent lactations and phases after calving.

Also, Mpwapwa calves were observed to grow much faster than calves of indigenous cattle. So far, no significant losses have been reported due to diseases or other environmental stress factors. At present there are about 50 Mpwapwa breed cattle at Berege. Therefore there is an urgent need of introducing an appropriate breeding programme for the herd {{in order to avoid the}} increased possibility of inbreeding and to facilitate a wider disribution of the improved zebu type of cattle to farmers in need of them...|$|R
40|$|Growth {{of exotic}} dairy calves {{in the tropics}} and subtropics has been {{investigated}} (Kabuga and Agyemang, 1984; Adeneye, 1985).

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to detect the {{associations}} between bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV- 1) status of a herd and respiratory disease (BRD) occurrence and reproductive performance in pregnant heifers and cows. The association between management-related factors and higher BRD occurrence was also estimated. Methods Serum samples, collected from cows and youngstock from 103 dairy cattle herds, were analyzed for antibodies against BHV- 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), and Mycoplasma bovis. A questionnaire was used to collect data concerning herd management factors and reproductive performance, as well as the occurrence of clinical signs of respiratory disease in the last two years, as evaluated by the veterinarian or farm manager. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and logistic regression analysis were performed to identify and quantify the risk factors. Results A low to moderate prevalence (1 - 49 %) of BRSV antibodies among youngstock was associated with a high occurrence of respiratory disease (OR = 6. 2, p = 0. 010) in cows and <b>in-calf</b> <b>heifers.</b> Employees of the farm may participate in the spread of such disease. Larger herd size, loose-housing of cows, housing youngstock separately from cows until pregnancy, and purchasing new animals were factors possibly related to a high occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms in pregnant heifers and cows. The highest risk of abortions (> 1. 3 %) and increased insemination index (number of inseminations per pregnancy) (> 1. 9) occurred in herds with a moderate prevalence of BHV- 1 antibodies (1 - 49 %) in cows. Conclusions BHV- 1 was not associated with acute respiratory disease in adult dairy cattle, however was significantly related to reproductive performance. BRSV possesses the main role in respiratory disease complex in adult dairy cattle. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine time budgets, blood urea content, total protein and body condition score as adaptive responses to seasonal dynamics by breeding Nguni cows and heifers reared on a sweetveld. Twenty four clinically healthy Nguni cows and heifers were selected for the study. The animals were grouped according to their parities namely: Parity 1 (n= 5), Parity 2 (n= 5), Parity 3 - 6 (old cows) (n= 9) and <b>in-calf</b> <b>heifers</b> (n= 5). Two separate experiments were conducted and running concurrently. In the first experiment time budgets (time spent walking, grazing, lying down, drinking water and browsing) of the cows and heifers were monitored for two consecutive days once a month, while in the second experiment blood samples were collected from the coccygeal vein once a month during weighing. Body condition scores were also determined during weighing times. Heifers maintained significantly (p 0. 05) of both blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (7. 5 ± 0. 39 mmol/l) and TP (80. 7 ± 1. 19 g/l) in November. All the animals had the least BUN levels in January (1. 93 ± 0. 18 mmol/l) while the highest total protein (TP) (82. 1 ± 1. 08 g/l) was recorded in February. All the animals showed distinct (p 0. 05) in most behavioural attributes in the cool-wet season. Heifers spent significantly (p 0. 05) body condition scores, amount of time spent browsing and drinking water. On the other hand, heifers (14. 7 ± 1. 50 %) and first parity cows (13. 9 ± 1. 50 %) traded-off most (p< 0, 05) of their time walking during the cool-dry season. Similarly heifers spent more time browsing (6. 4 ± 0. 62 %) forage plants (p< 0. 05) than all the cows during the cool-wet season. Grazing (r = 0. 17) and standing (r = - 0. 18) were correlated (p< 0. 05) with all the behavioural attributes measured in this environment. It was concluded that seasonal dynamics in trade-off behaviour through time budgeting, maintenance of BUN and TP were necessary for the Nguni cows and heifers to maintain their body condition scores within a narrow range throughout the four seasons...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUrine patches {{deposited}} by grazing cattle represent ‘hot-spots’ of {{very high}} nitrogen (N) loading from which environmentally important losses of N may occur (ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions, nitrate leaching). Information on the quantities of N deposited to grazed pastures as urine, the spatial and temporal distribution of urine patches and how these {{may be influenced by}} pasture management practices is limited. The objectives of this study were to assess the potential of recently developed urine sensors for providing data on urination behaviour by grazing cattle and relate this to measurements of ammonia emissions from the grazed paddocks. A total of six trials were conducted across two sites; two on a 1 ha paddock at Easter Bush near Edinburgh using beef cattle (c. 630 kg live weight) and four on a 0. 5 ha paddock at North Wyke in Devon using <b>in-calf</b> dairy <b>heifers</b> (c. 450 kg live weight). Laboratory calibrations were conducted to provide sensor-specific functions for urine volume and N concentration. The quantity and quality of data from the urine sensors improved with successive trials through modifications to the method of attachment to the cow. The number of urination events per animal per day was greater for the dairy heifers, with a mean value of 11. 6 (se 0. 70) compared with 7. 6 (se 0. 76) for the beef cattle. Volume per urination event (mean 1. 8, range 0. 4 – 6. 4 L) and urine N concentration (range 0. 6 – 31. 5 gL− 1, excluding outliers) were similar for the two groups of cattle. Ammonia emission measurements were unsuccessful in most of the trials. The urine sensors have potential to provide useful information on urine N deposition by grazing cattle but suggested improvements including making the sensors lighter, designing a better method of attachment to the cow and including a more reliable location sensor...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate reproductive performance of Ethiopian Boran cows at Abernosa ranch in the production of Boron x Holstein-Friesian Ft crossbred dairy heifers for distribution to smallholder farmers. Performance data from the ranch between 1993 and 2001 was used for this study. The results show delayed age at first conception (53. 9 months) and long'calving interval (534. 3 days), with average breeding efficiency of 44. 6 %, average calving rate of 72 % and heifer production efficiency of only 38 %. The pre and post weaning calf mortality rates were 17. 3 and 2. 9 %, respectively. These led to a very low average cost recovery on in calf heifer production of only 14. 6 %. Based on the average herd productivity parameters determined in this study, it was calculated that this rate of cost recovery could be improved three fold to 42. 8 % by introducing such realistic management interventions as replacement of old and unproductive cows with average performing ones, enforcing a clearly defined breeding practice, managing open cows and heifers separately for better beat detection, supplementary feeding and timely mating, and full utilization of the available resources for the key output of the ranch - <b>in-calf</b> crossbred <b>heifers.</b> Furthermore, between 1994 and 2000, annually on average 20 % of the crossbred heifers were culled for health difficulties, physical injury and unknown reasons. If this rather high culling rate could be reduced by half through separate and proper management of heifers, the number of available heifers for mating could be increased by 15. 4 %, and with this, also the number of in calf heifers available for distribution. Overall, it was noted that the production of in calf crossbred heifers in the ranch has been very inefficient. It was therefore recommended that alternative ways of producing crossbred heifers such as contract production with smallholder farmers or commercial farmers and direct production of crossbred heifers in the hands of smallholder farmers who own suitable indigenous cows should be considered for more economical production of crossbred heifers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the establishment and}} Development of the first indigenous cattle breed improvement endeavors in Ethiopia at the Adami Tulu and Abernossa Cattle Multiplication and Improvement Center, in the Rift Valley. It is intended to analyse and document {{the activities of the}} center and use the experiences of the center over the last three decades as a springboard for future livestock breed improvement efforts in the country. The center commenced its activities in October 1960 with an establishment herd of 351 Borana cows and 12 Borana bulls purchased from Borana and Arrero Awrajas of the then Sidamo Administration Region in southern Ethiopia. The Adami Tulu part of the ranch was the first to be established on an area of 1534 ha. The Abernossa ranch, located about 12 km south west of Adami Tulu ranch, was established in 1962 on an area of : 1240 ha. The major objective of this activity was to improve the Borana cattle and also to introduce modern cattle breeding and production system in the country. Activities were expanded to include a crossbreeding programme with Holstein Friesian cattle to produce <b>in-calf</b> crossbred <b>heifers</b> for distribution to farmers interested in dairy Development. Subsequently, the Borana selection and improvement programme was re-located at the Didi Tura ranch in Borana country and the center was restructured to focus on crossbred heifer production only. In its 35 years of existence, the center's activities have gone through a number of expansion and contraction, and accordingly genetic progress and retrogress in the breed improvement efforts. A major destruction and damage occurred on the ranch in 1991 when there was a change in government. Infrastructure was destroyed, records were burnt and animals were either slaughtered or looted. Subsequently, about half of the land area was given back to the local community by popular demand and the ranch was confined to the eastern part with approximately 2, 000 ha. New stock (heifers) was purchased from the Borana country and restocking and improvement activities recommenced. Currently, the ranch manages about 2, 000 heads of breeder cows and still produces crossbred heifers. Over the years, the ranch had made significant genetic improvement on the Borana cattle through performance evaluation and selection. However, the attempt to undertake such farfetched and long-term programme has been repeatedly hampered by the local community demanding their land rights. A participatory genetic improvement programmes that benefit local communities and the nation coupled with appropriate education and awareness creation in the community should have been designed to ensure full participation and support by the community for such long-term genetic improvement programmes...|$|R
40|$|Data {{collected}} between 1977 and 1985 on reproductive {{and growth}} traits of Borana cattle and their crosses with Friesian, were analysed using the least-squares procedure. The animals were maintained for beef and <b>in-calf</b> dairy <b>heifer</b> {{production at the}} Abernossa Cattle Breeding and Improvement Ranch of the Ministry of Agriculture. The result of the analysis showed that {{the mean number of}} services per conception for first pregnancy was 1. 701. The difference among the breed groups was not significant but both year and season of conception had significant influence. Heifers, which conceived during the small rainy and dry seasons, required 0. 16 and 0. 21 more services, respectively, than those conceiving during the big rainy season. Age at first calving (AFC) averaged 31. 5, 32. 7, 45. 2 and 46. 8 months for F 1, 3 / 4 Friesian, Boran mated to Boran bulls and artificially inseminated Boran heifers, respectively. Year of birth had a significant effect on AFC of all mating groups except on that of artificially inseminated Boran heifers. Season of birth had significant effect on AFC of Fl heifers only. The mean values for calving interval (CI) were 465, 552, 525 and 437 days respectively for Boran cows mated to Boran bulls, Boran cows mated to Friesian bulls, Boran cows artificially inseminated and Fl cows artificially inseminated. Year of calving had a significant effect on CI of all cow mating groups but influence of season was significant on Boran cows mated to Boran bulls and Boran cows artificially inseminated only. Parity had signficant influence on CI of all Boran dams, but not on F 1 dams. The preweaning mortality rate was 4. 0 % and 2. 9 % for Borana and Fl cross calves, respectively. Parity of dam, sex of calf and the interaction between breed group of calf and year of birth were significant. The total mortality rate up to first calving age for pure Boran cattle was estimated to be 11. 5 %. Based on this a cow in Boran Breeding unit needed 2. 27 calvings to produce a heifer calf that could in turn calve in the herd. Thus, 37 percent of the females born were required as herd replacements, and the generation interval was 6. 6 years. Mean body weight of Boran, Fl and 3 / 4 Friesian cross calves was 25. 17 kg, 25. 39 kg and 25. 73 kg at birth and 157. 5 kg, 176. 7 kg and 179. 9 kg at weaning, respectively. All factors included in the analysis and their interaction had a significant effect on both parameters {{with the exception of the}} effect of season of birth and its interaction with breed group on birth weight. Weights of Boran calves at one-, two- and three-years of age were 179 kg, 269 kg and 338 kg, respectively. Sex and year of birth had significant effect on weights at these three stages. Season of birth had a significant effect on the two-year weight while the effect of parity of dam was significant on the one-year weight only. Estimated heritability values of 0. 32, 0. 24, 0. 43, 0. 29 and 0. 24 for birth, weaning, one-year, two-year and three-year weights of Boran cattle suggest that body weight increase of 0. 11. 1. 1, 2. 8, 3. 1 and 2. 4 kg per year could be achieved through selection at the respective ages. Cow productivity index of 127 kg and 122 kg of an eight-month old weaner calf per cow per year was estimated for Boran cows weaning Boran and F 1 calves, respectively. Cow productivity of all cows was significantly influenced by year of calving and parity of dam. Boran cows producing F 1 calves were more productive when calving during the small rainy season than those calving during the other seasons...|$|R
