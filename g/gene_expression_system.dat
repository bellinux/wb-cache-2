40|$|Background Selective {{serotonin}} reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine are {{the most}} common form of medication treatment for major depression. However, approximately 50 % of depressed patients fail to achieve an effective treatment response. Understanding how gene expression systems respond to treatments may be critical for understanding antidepressant resistance. Methods We take a novel approach to this problem by demonstrating that the <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> <b>system</b> of the dentate gyrus responds to fluoxetine (FLX), a commonly used antidepressant medication, in a stereotyped-manner involving changes in the expression levels of thousands of genes. The aggregate behavior of this large-scale systemic response was quantified with principal components analysis (PCA) yielding a single quantitative measure of the global <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> <b>system</b> state. Results Quantitative measures of system state were highly correlated with variability in levels of antidepressant-sensitive behaviors in a mouse model of depression treated with fluoxetine. Analysis of dorsal and ventral dentate samples in the same mice indicated that system state co-varied across these regions despite their reported functional differences. Aggregate measures of <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> <b>system</b> state were very robust and remained unchanged when different microarray data processing algorithms were used and even when completely different sets of gene expression levels were used for their calculation. Conclusions System state measures provide a robust method to quantify and relate global <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> <b>system</b> state variability to behavior and treatment. State variability also suggests that the diversity of reported changes in gene expression levels in response to treatments such as fluoxetine may represent different perspectives on unified but noisy global <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> <b>system</b> state level responses. Studying regulation of gene expression systems at the state level may be useful in guiding new approaches to augmentation of traditional antidepressant treatments...|$|E

40|$|Introduction <b>Gene</b> <b>expression</b> is an {{important}} process whereby the genotype controls an individual cell’s phenotype. However, even genetically identical cells display a variety of phenotypes, which {{may be attributed to}} differences in their environment. Yet, even after controlling for these two factors, individual phenotypes still diverge due to noisy <b>gene</b> <b>expression.</b> Synthetic <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> <b>systems</b> allow investigators to isolate, control, and measure the effects of noise on cell phenotypes. I used mathematical and computational methods to design, study, and predict the behavior of synthetic <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> <b>systems</b> in S. cerevisiae, which were affected by noise. Methods I created probabilistic biochemical reaction models from known behaviors of the tetR and rtTA genes, gene products, and their gene architectures. I then simplified these models to account for essential behaviors of <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> <b>systems.</b> Finally, I used these models to predict behaviors of modified <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> <b>systems,</b> which were experimentally verified. Results Cell growth, which is often ignored when formulating chemical kinetics models, was essential for understanding <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> behavior. Models incorporating growth effects were used to explain unexpected reductions in <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> noise, design a set of <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> <b>systems</b> with “linear” dose-responses, and quantify the speed with which cells explored their fitness landscapes due to noisy <b>gene</b> <b>expression.</b> Conclusions Models incorporating noisy <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> and cell division were necessary to design, understand, and predict the behaviors of synthetic <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> <b>systems.</b> The methods and models developed here will allow investigators to more efficiently design new <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> <b>systems,</b> and infer <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> properties of TetR based systems...|$|R

The <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> <b>system</b> was based on potato virus X (PVX). Tomato plants that were both susceptible to strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato carrying the corresponding avirulence gene avrPto and insensitive to the insecticide fenthion were infected with in vitro-generated transcripts of PVX derivatives containing either Pto or Fen. Expression of the Pto gene from the virus genome failed to elicit P. s. tomato resistance, indicating that the PVX system is not suitable {{for the study of}} Pto. However, expression of the Fen gene resulted in sensitivity to fenthion. The utility of the PVX <b>gene</b> <b>expression</b> <b>system</b> was further demonstrated through structure/function studies of the Fen gene. A correlation was shown between Fen protein kinase activity and the ability of this protein to confer fenthion sensitivity to tomato. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that mutation of a putative N-terminal myristoylation site, proposed to be involved in membrane targeting, rendered the Fen protein inactive. Analysis of a Pto-Fen chimeric gene allowed the fenthion sensitivity domain to be localized to the C-terminal part of the Fen protein. Interestingly, expression of the Fen kinase from the PVX genome in Nicotiana spp resulted in a fenthion-independent necrotic response.
