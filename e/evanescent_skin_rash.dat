Children with systemic {{juvenile idiopathic arthritis}} often show growth retardation and developmental abnormality, as well as macrophage activation syndrome, a life-threatening complication. Overproduction of interleukin- 6 is pathologically responsible for the systemic inflammatory manifestations and abnormal laboratory results with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Thus, tocilizumab, a humanized antihuman interleukin- 6 receptor antibody, has been developed as a therapeutic agent for the disease. A series of clinical studies have demonstrated the excellent efficacy and safety of tocilizumab for patients with active disease. Tocilizumab was approved for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis in Japan in 2008 and in the European Union and the United States in 2011.

40|$|AbstractFirst {{described}} in 1971, adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) {{is a rare}} multisystemic disorder considered as a complex (multigenic) autoinflammatory syndrome. A genetic background would confer susceptibility {{to the development of}} autoinflammatory reactions to environmental triggers. Macrophage and neutrophil activation is a hallmark of AOSD which can lead to a reactive hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. As in the latter disease, the cytotoxic function of natural killer cells is decreased in patients with active AOSD. IL- 18 and IL- 1 β, two proinflammatory cytokines processed through the inflammasome machinery, are key factors in the pathogenesis of AOSD; they cause IL- 6 and Th 1 cytokine secretion as well as NK cell dysregulation leading to macrophage activation. The clinico-biological picture of AOSD usually includes high spiking fever with joint symptoms, <b>evanescent</b> <b>skin</b> <b>rash,</b> sore throat, striking neutrophilic leukocytosis, hyperferritinemia with collapsed glycosylated ferritin (< 20 %), and abnormal liver function tests. According to the clinical presentation of the disease at diagnosis, two AOSD phenotypes may be distinguished: i) a highly symptomatic, systemic and feverish one, which would evolve into a systemic (mono- or polycyclic) pattern; ii) a more indolent one with arthritis in the foreground and poor systemic symptomatology, which would evolve into a chronic articular pattern. Steroid- and methotrexate-refractory AOSD cases benefit now from recent insights into autoinflammatory disorders: anakinra seems to be an efficient, well tolerated, steroid-sparing treatment in systemic patterns; tocilizumab seems efficient in AOSD with active arthritis and systemic symptoms while TNFα-blockers could be interesting in chronic polyarticular refractory AOSD...|$|E

30|$|One {{important}} question is that why the <b>skin</b> <b>rash</b> emerged on the normal skin of the patients of lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutation, although did not without EGFR mutation. Indeed, in this study, 3 cases without EGFR mutation treated by gefitinib resulted in PD and <b>skin</b> <b>rash</b> did not occurred at all. Francasso reported that administration of single doses (250 – 500 mg/m 2) of cetuximab resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in EGFR protein expression levels in skin (Fracasso et al. 2007). Biopsy of the lesions of <b>skin</b> <b>rash</b> induced by gefitinib showed prominent keratin plugging in dilated infundibula of hair follicles, a superficial purulent folliculitis and disordered differentiation with focal parakeratosis were seen (Albanell et al. 2002, Van Doorn et al. 2002).

MethodsPubMed and Scopus databases, up to 15 March 2014 were searched to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies included prospective studies, retrospective studies and postmarketing reports, which included data of <b>skin</b> <b>rash</b> in patients with LTG therapy. ResultsForty-one articles met the entry criteria. A total of 4447 patients with LTG therapy from 26 prospective studies, 2977 patients from 8 retrospective studies, and 26, 126 patients from 5 / 7 postmarketing reports were included. The overall incidence of <b>skin</b> <b>rash</b> with LTG therapy was 9. 98 % (444 / 4447) from prospective studies, 7. 19 % (214 / 2977) from retrospective studies, and 2. 09 % (547 / 26, 126) from postmarketing reports. A meta-analysis {{of the risk of}} <b>skin</b> <b>rash</b> in 21 prospective studies, did not show a significant difference between patients with LTG and other drugs, including placebo, other ADEs or lithium (OR 0. 99 – 2. 41).

However, {{there was no significant difference}} in rash risk between patients with LTG and aromatic AEDs. ConclusionsOur study showed that LTG significantly increased the risk of developing a <b>skin</b> <b>rash</b> compared to non-aromatic AEDs.
