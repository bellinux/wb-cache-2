5|$|Birbhum is a {{major centre}} of cottage industries. Perhaps the most notable cottage {{industry}} is a non-profit rural organisation named Amar Kutir. Other main industries in Birbhum are agriculture-based industries, textiles, forestry, arts and crafts. Sriniketan is noted for its dairy industry and as a forestry centre. Some of the notable forms of cottage industries of Birbhum include textile—especially cotton and locally harvested tussar silk, jute works, batik, kantha stitch, macramé (weaving by <b>knotting</b> threads), leather, pottery and terracotta, solapith, woodcarving, bamboo and cane craft, metal works and tribal crafts. There are 8,883 small and medium scale industries. Principal industries of the district include cotton and silk harvesting and weaving, rice and oilseed milling, lac harvesting, and metalware and pottery manufacture. Bakreshwar Thermal Power Station (210 MW x 3 + 210 MW x 2 under construction) is the only heavy industry in the district.|$|E

25|$|Secondary {{structures}} in the DNA can result in folding or <b>knotting</b> of DNA template or primers, leading to decreased product yield {{or failure of the}} reaction. Hairpins, which consist of internal folds caused by base-pairing between nucleotides in inverted repeats within single-stranded DNA, are common secondary structures and may result in failed PCRs.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} styles of <b>knotting,</b> {{but the two}} main types of knot are the {{symmetrical}} (also called Turkish or Ghiordes) and asymmetrical (also called Persian or Senna). Contemporary centres of knotted carpet production are: Lahore and Peshawar (Pakistan), Kashmir (India / Pakistan), Mirzapur, Bhadohi, Tabriz (Iran), Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Northern Africa, Nepal, Spain, Turkmenistan, and Tibet. The importance of carpets {{in the culture of}} Turkmenistan is such that the national flag features a vertical red stripe near the hoist side, containing five carpet guls (designs used in producing rugs). Kashmir is known for handknotted carpets of silk or wool. Child labour has often been used in Asia for hand <b>knotting</b> rugs. The GoodWeave labelling scheme used throughout Europe and North America assures that child labour has not been used: importers pay for the labels, and the revenue collected is used to monitor centres of production and educate previously exploited children.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>knotted</b> stitch is any {{embroidery}} {{technique in}} which the yarn or thread is <b>knotted</b> around itself.

There are many different stitches used to create hemp jewellery, however, the half knot and full knot stitches are most common.|$|E
25|$|Knot theory, {{a branch}} of topology, is used in biology to {{study the effects of}} certain enzymes on DNA. These enzymes cut, twist, and {{reconnect}} the DNA, causing <b>knotting</b> with observable effects such as slower electrophoresis. Topology is also used in evolutionary biology to represent the relationship between phenotype and genotype. Phenotypic forms that appear quite different can be separated by only a few mutations depending on how genetic changes map to phenotypic changes during development.|$|E
25|$|The rebozo is woven {{in places}} such as Jilotepec, Tejupilco, Calimaya and {{especially}} Tenancingo. The work that goes into making the garments is generally divided among several artisans, specializing in a particular process: dying (especially if the ikat method is used), weaving and <b>knotting</b> the fringes. The rebozos of Tenancingo are made with commercial cotton thread and often tied with the ikat method to make traditional designs with names such as arco de Granada, flor de haba, labor doble, llovizna, palacios, venados, ratoncitos and coyotes.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We study Legendrian <b>knots</b> in a cabled <b>knot</b> type. Specifically, given a topological <b>knot</b> type K, we {{analyze the}} Legendrian <b>knots</b> in <b>knot</b> types {{obtained}} from K by cabling, {{in terms of}} Legendrian <b>knots</b> in the <b>knot</b> type K. As a corollary of this analysis, we show that the (2, 3) -cable of the (2, 3) -torus <b>knot</b> is not transversely simple and moreover classify the transverse <b>knots</b> in this <b>knot</b> type. This is the first classification of transverse <b>knots</b> in a non-transversely-simple <b>knot</b> type. We also classify Legendrian <b>knots</b> in this <b>knot</b> type and exhibit the first example of a Legendrian <b>knot</b> that does not destabilize, yet its Thurston-Bennequin invariant is not maximal among Legendrian representatives in its <b>knot</b> type. 1...|$|R
50|$|In <b>knot</b> theory, the granny <b>knot</b> is a {{composite}} <b>knot</b> obtained by taking the connected sum of two identical trefoil <b>knots.</b> It {{is closely related to}} the square <b>knot,</b> which can also be described as a connected sum of two trefoils.

25|$|In some {{decorative}} applications, {{wood with}} knots may be desirable to add visual interest. In applications where wood is painted, such as skirting boards, fascia boards, door frames and furniture, resins {{present in the}} timber may continue to 'bleed' through {{to the surface of}} a knot for months or even years after manufacture and show as a yellow or brownish stain. A knot primer paint or solution (<b>knotting),</b> correctly applied during preparation, may do much to reduce this problem {{but it is difficult to}} control completely, especially when using mass-produced kiln-dried timber stocks.|$|E
25|$|Another {{carpet in}} the Pergamon Museum was dated to before 1500 AD. It shows four double-headed quadrupeds within a {{rectangular}} field {{surrounded by an}} eight-pointed star. The uppermost star is cut off. The stars are framed by smaller octagonal ornaments, two at their sides, one each {{at the top and}} bottom of each star. A smaller guardian border separates the field from the main border, which shows stylized leaves adorning S-shaped ornaments. Smaller triangular elements of the design and the outlines of the animals are woven in offset <b>knotting.</b> By its colours, the carpet has been localized to Central Anatolia. On the reverse of the carpet, additional wefts can be seen meandering over two warps after about every 22 regular wefts. The additional weft changes its colour from yellow to red, roughly at the middle of the carpet. It has been interpreted to show a day's work of two weavers working besides each other. If taken as such, the number of knots woven by each weaver would amount to roughly 2,500 knots per day. (Beselin 2011, p.50–1) See: knot density.|$|E
25|$|Akbar, a Mogul emperor, is {{accredited}} to {{introducing the}} art of carpet weaving to India during his reign. The Mughal emperors patronized Persian carpets for their royal courts and palaces. During this period, he brought Persian craftsmen from their homeland and established them in India. Initially, the carpets woven showed the classic Persian style of fine <b>knotting.</b> Gradually it blended with Indian art. Thus the carpets produced became typical of the Indian origin and gradually the industry began to diversify and spread all over the subcontinent. During the Mughal period, the carpets made on the Indian subcontinent became so famous that demand for them spread abroad. These carpets had distinctive designs and boasted a high density of knots. Carpets made for the Mughal emperors, including Jahangir and Shah Jahan, were of the finest quality. Under Shah Jahan's reign, Mughal carpet weaving took on a new aesthetic and entered its classical phase. Indian carpets are well known for their designs with attention to detail and presentation of realistic attributes. The carpet industry in India flourished more in its northern part with major centres found in Kashmir, Jaipur, Agra and Bhadohi.|$|E

The Royalist James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose occupied Doune Castle in 1645, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. In 1654, during Glencairn's rising against the occupation of Scotland by Oliver Cromwell, a skirmish took place at Doune between Royalists under Sir Mungo Murray, and Cromwellian troops under Major Tobias Bridge. The castle was garrisoned by government troops during the Jacobite Rising of Bonnie Dundee in 1689, when repairs were ordered, and again during the rising of 1715. During the Jacobite Rising of 1745, Doune Castle was occupied by Charles Edward Stuart, [...] "Bonnie Prince Charlie", and his Jacobite Highlanders. It {{was used as a}} prison for government troops captured at the Battle of Falkirk. Several prisoners, held in the rooms above the kitchen, escaped by <b>knotting</b> together bedsheets and climbing from the window. Escapees included the author John Home, and a minister, John Witherspoon, who later moved to the American colonies and became a signatory of the United States Declaration of Independence.|$|E
