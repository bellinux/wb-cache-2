Participants (2 - 10 years of age, n= 13) with a history of mild constipation were assigned randomly to a fibre treatment or placebo group. After three weeks, subjects were crossed over to the other treatment. Pea <b>hull</b> <b>fibre</b> (4. 0 - 7. 6 g/day = 3. 6 - 6. 8 g/day of dietary fibre) was added to snack foods and an inulin supplement (5. 0 g/day = 4. 5 g/day of dietary fibre) was given, whereas the placebos were non-fortified snacks and maltodextrin (5. 0 g/day). Subjects or their parents documented stool frequency, stool consistency, occurrence of abdominal pain and intake of snack foods and the supplement. Over the final two weeks, there was a trend towards an increase in the mean number of daily bowel movements in the fibre treatment group compared to the placebo group (n= 11, 0. 68 ± 0. 18 vs. 0. 59 ± 0. 26, p= 0. 064). Exclusion of one subject with diarrhea-type stools led to a significant difference between groups (n= 10, 0. 54 ± 0. 18 vs. 0. 67 ± 0. 22, p= 0. 002). Stool consistency, using the Bristol Stool Form Rating Scale, showed no significant differences in stool consistency between groups (p= 0. 379) nor was there a difference in the incidences of abdominal pain (p= 0. 129). Not all subjects experienced abdominal pain. The inulin supplement (91 % compliance rate; 1 serving per day) was consumed more consistently than were the snack foods fortified with pea <b>hull</b> <b>fibre</b> (77 % compliance rate; 2 servings per day).

40|$|To ensure {{health and}} {{reproductive}} {{capacity of the}} birds, broiler breeders are fed restricted during the rearing period, {{and to a lesser}} extent also during the production period. Although restricted feeding improves health and thereby bird welfare, on the other hand the birds are chronically hungry and suffer from frustration of the feeding motivation, which has a negative effect on bird welfare. The aim of the current paper is to give an overview of the relation between feed restriction and broiler breeder welfare, and the role of feed (nutritional aspects as well as feeding management) as a possible tool to improve broiler breeder welfare. Possible strategies are 1) dietary dilution, by reducing the energy content and/or increasing the NSP content, by adding soluble (e. g. sugar beet pulp) or insoluble (e. g. oat <b>hulls)</b> <b>fibres</b> to the diet; 2) adding appetite suppressants (e. g. calcium propionate) to the diet; 3) scattering feed in the litter; 4) feeding twice a day, or 5) skip-a-day feeding. Some of these strategies, i. e. dietary dilution or adding appetite suppressants positively affect behavioural patterns of the birds, by reducing stereotypic pecking and eating motivation, and increasing the time spent sitting. These changes, however, can only be considered as indirect parameters of improved bird welfare. It is clear that nutritional strategies can be helpful in reducing hunger stress in broiler breeders. Nutrition, however, cannot fully solve the broiler breeder paradox. The main reason for this paradox is related to breeding goals, that are focussed on improving feed conversion and increasing breast meat percentage. On short term, using dwarf broiler breeder hens could be an alternative. On long term, future genetic selection should be directed on assigning economic values to welfare and including integrity traits in an extended breeding goal...|$|R

40|$|Milling {{and feed}} grain quality {{improvement}} are cornerstones of the Crop Development Centre oat improvement program. Oat quality improvement focuses on food use, {{but the majority}} of world production is fed to ruminant livestock, thus feed quality improvement deserves consideration. This is especially true in western Canada where the feed market sets the base price for oat, and without assurance of an alternative feed market, growers cannot economically consider growing oat. While what makes a good food oat generally makes a good feed oat, specific feed value improvements can be made. Breeding to improve feed quality must consider physical and chemical traits, target livestock class and quality of competing grains. This generally means improving oat energy density for ruminants (especially cattle in Canada) versus that from barley, maize or wheat. Oat is considered the poorest grain because of high levels of indigestible <b>fibre</b> (<b>hull)</b> and low energy density. Improved physical quality, concentrating on increased groat/hull, is a major goal and has greatly improved the feed value of recent CDC varieties. Simultaneous selection for low % hull and greater uniformity, plumpness, bulk density (Test wt.) and size (MKW) resulted in varieties like CDC Dancer with significant genetic improvement in % groat and uniformity resulting in lower ADF, NDF, lignin and crude fibre and increased starch. Combining this improved physical quality with the LLH (low acid detergent hull) trait reported in 2000 (Thompson et al, 2000), where hull digestibility for ruminants is doubled, and increasing energy density by introducing greater groat fat (HOG), the LLH-HOG feed oat project to produce a whole grain oat for cattle with feed value of barley and approaching that of maize has been developed. Initial feed trial results demonstrate that LLH adds 6. 5 7. 5 % energy and HOG adds 2. 0 2. 5 % versus regular oat, with a total LLH-HOG energy of 84 84. 5 % TDN versus 82. 5 % for barley. On an economic basis this translates to LLH-HOG oat valued at $ 129 /tonne in western Canada versus barley at $ 103 and maize at $ 110. LLH-HOG selections, entered in the 2004 Western Canadian Co-operative Oat trials, should be considered for registration and release in 2006. Thompson, R. K., et al. 2000.

40|$|Fine tuning a {{nutritional}} strategy by incorporating dietary fibre (DF) in pig diets {{can help to}} improve gut health. Fermentation of DF, especially the soluble fraction, in pig intestines yields short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and lactic acid, which {{have been found to}} improve gut health by favouring the growth of health-promoting bacteria such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, at the expense of pathogenic ones like Clostridium or Salmonella, which may enhance the health of host species. The presence of fermentable fibre in the pig diet can also contribute to reducing nitrogen (N) excretion, which can {{have a positive impact on}} the environmental footprint, one of the main concerns of a modern commercial pork production. The overall objective of this thesis project was to evaluate the fermentation characteristics of a selection of feedstuffs in the pig intestines and their potential impact on the gut environment and nitrogen excretion. The evaluation was performed by executing two projects using both in vitro and in vivo studies. The first project focused on the fermentation characteristics of hulless barley in comparison to hulled barley and oats and their effects on the gut environment, especially the production of fermentation metabolites. The rate of fibre fermentation in the intestines was first studied by means of an in vitro gas production technique. The results demonstrated that hulless barleys have higher fermentability and produce higher amounts of SCFA than hulled barley and oats. An experiment carried out on pigs confirmed that the fermentation of the soluble fibre fraction of hulless barley in the gut leads to increased production of SCFA and lactic acid, which in turn contribute to the growth of potentially beneficial microbiota and decrease potentially harmful bacteria, an indicator of improved gut health. This finding shows that gut health parameters may be modulated. Thus gut health could potentially be improved through feed formulation by a judicious selection of feed ingredients with specific fibre fractions, not only by the addition of isolated fibres, which is commonly recommended at present. The second project was executed to study the effect of some feedstuffs differing in their DF and protein content on fermentation characteristics and N excretion in pigs. The feedstuffs included wheat bran, wood cellulose, peas, pea <b>hulls,</b> pea inner <b>fibre,</b> sugar beet pulp, flax seed meal and corn distiller's dried grains with solubles. The results showed that peas and pea fibre-based diets produced higher amounts of SCFA and reduced N excreted, compared to others. In a parallel in vitro study, fermentation characteristics and bacterial protein synthesis was also studied using the same feed ingredients. The findings of the in vitro study corraborated the results of the in vivo experiment. These studies showed that peas and pea fibres have the potential to be used in pig diets in order to gain gut health-benefits and reduce N excretion. From this thesis, it can be concluded that sources and type of dietary fibre have a significant effect on the production of fermentation metabolites in the pig intestine and on N excretion. Among the feed ingredients studied, hulless barley and pea fibres seem to have the greatest potential to be included in pig diets as a source of fermentable fibre to modulate the gut environment, which in turn, extend possibly health-promoting properties and reduce N excretion from pigs. However, further research is needed to understand the specific health benefits of these fibre sources and to quantify the specific fibre components required to achieve these benefits...|$|R
