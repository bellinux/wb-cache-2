500|$|On 12 September, Lord Dingwall {{had landed}} at Leith, {{reporting}} that [...] "he {{had come in}} company with the Queen's fleet three hundred miles, and was separated from them by a great storm: it was feared that the Queen was in danger upon the seas." [...] Alarmed, James called for national fasting and public prayers, kept watch on the Firth of Forth for Anne's arrival, wrote several songs, one comparing the situation {{to the plight of}} Hero and Leander, and sent a search party out for Anne, carrying a letter he had written to her in French: [...] "Only to one who knows me as well as his own reflection in a glass could I express, my dearest love, the fears which I have experienced because of the contrary winds and violent storms since you embarked...". Informed in October that the Danes had abandoned the crossing for the winter, and in what Willson calls [...] "the one romantic episode of his life", James sailed from Leith with a three-hundred-strong retinue to fetch his wife personally, arriving in Oslo on 19 November after travelling by land from Flekkefjord via Tønsberg. According to a Scottish account, he presented himself to Anne, [...] "with boots and all", and, disarming her protests, gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>kiss</b> in the Scottish fashion.|$|E
2500|$|Nilsson {{followed}} {{quickly with}} Son of Schmilsson (1972), released while its predecessor {{was still in}} the charts. Besides the problem of competing with himself, Nilsson was by then ignoring most of Perry's production advice and his decision to give free rein to his bawdiness and bluntness on this release alienated some of his earlier, more conservative fan base. With lyrics like [...] "I sang my balls off for you, baby", [...] "Roll the world over / And give <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>kiss</b> and a feel", and the notorious [...] "You're breakin' my heart / You're tearin' it apart / So fuck you" [...] (a reference to his ongoing divorce), Nilsson had traveled far afield from his earlier work. The album nevertheless reached #12 on the Billboard 200, and the single [...] "Spaceman" [...] was a Top 40 hit in October 1972. The follow-up single [...] "Remember (Christmas)", however, stalled at #53. A third single, the tongue-in-cheek C send up [...] "Joy", was issued on RCA's country imprint Green and credited to Buck Earle, but it failed to chart.|$|E

60|$|Mary {{showed her}} white teeth {{in a silent}} laugh at the improbability, there being nothing Ethel more detested than what she rather rudely called nervous quackeries. Her father gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>kiss</b> of {{grateful}} approbation, and was gone.|$|E

60|$|Tom laughed, and {{was about}} to pinch the much {{enduring}} little nose; but, as if the words reminded him of something, he gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>kiss</b> instead, a piece of forbearance which almost took Maud's breath away with surprise and gratification.|$|E

50|$|Lucre scolds Witgood for {{not telling}} him about his engagement.

60|$|But in {{the main}} Maria was ill-suited to play heroine to her wooer's hero.
