40|$|Successful {{pathogens}} {{are equipped}} {{to exploit the}} signaling pathways of their host cell to <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>niche</b> conducive for their survival and proliferation. One emerging example is the modulation of the small GTPase Rab 1 by virulence factors of the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila. Besides proteins that mimic host regulatory factors involved in controlling Rab 1 activity, this bacterium temporally locks this small GTPase in its active form by AMPylation. Efficient release of Rab 1 from the bacterial phagosome requires deAMPylation prior to being inactivated by the bacterial GAP protein LepB. Whether Rab activity is similarly regulated under native condition is unknown, {{but it is clear}} that virulence factors from pathogens can be invaluable tools in dissecting the intricacy of host cellular processes...|$|R

In the framework of Grinnell, the species niche was largely equivalent to its habitat, such that <b>a</b> <b>niche</b> vacancy <b>could</b> be looked upon as a habitat vacancy. The Eltonian framework considered the niche to be equivalent to a species position in a trophic web, or food chain, and in this respect there {{is always going to}} be <b>a</b> vacant <b>niche</b> at the top predator level.

40|$|International audienceThe {{lifestyle}} of Chlamydiae is unique: the bacteria alternate between two morphologically distinct forms, an infectious non-replicative elementary body (EB), and a replicative, non-infectious reticulate body (RB). This review focuses on {{recent advances in}} understanding the structure and function of the infectious form of the best-studied member of the phylum, the human pathogen Chlamydia tra-chomatis. Once considered as an inert particle of little functional capacity, the EB is now perceived as a sophisticated entity that encounters at least three different environments during each infectious cycle. We review current knowledge on its composition and morphology, and emerging metabolic activities. These features confer resistance to the extracellular environment, the ability to penetrate a host cell and ultimately enable the EB to <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>niche</b> enabling bacterial survival and growth.

40|$|Brush seals have <b>established</b> <b>a</b> <b>niche</b> in the gas-to-gas sealing against leakage {{in modern}} turbine engines. The {{variable}} {{nature of the}} brush during operation makes leakage prediction difficult. A simple semi-empirical model based on an effective brush thickness parameter has been successfully used to correlate and predict brush seal leakage in engine environments. The model was extended to correlate a range of brush densities using a physically realistic brush thickness. Later, the model was based on mean diametric brush properties for a large range of circular brush seal geometries. However, the best basis for modeling bristle distribution was unknown. This paper proposes {{a solution to the}} distribution problem by assuming a randomly distributed bristle bed. A random distribution leads to a rectangular array model that is supported by the quality of leakage data generalization.
