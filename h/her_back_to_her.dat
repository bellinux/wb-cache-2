5|$|The Syriac, Jonah, who {{had helped}} Khalid enter the city by the East Gate, showed him a {{short-cut}} to Antioch. Leading a cavalry regiment, Khalid caught up with a convoy of Byzantine refugees from Damascus at the sea, near Antioch. The three-day truce had passed; Khalid's cavalry attacked the convoy during a heavy rain. In the subsequent battle, Khalid reportedly killed both Thomas and Harbees in a duel.

25|$|In 1943 Puyi {{married his}} fourth wife, a 15-year-old student named Li Yuqin, {{who was a}} Han Chinese from Changchun, Jilin. She was {{designated}} as Puyi's Concubine Fu (福貴人). In February 1943, school principal Kobayashi and teacher Fujii of the Nan-Ling Girls Academy took ten girl students to a photography studio for portraits. Three weeks later, the school teacher and the principal visited Li Yuqin's home and told her Puyi ordered {{her to go to}} the Manchukuo palace to study. She was first taken directly to Yasunori Yoshioka who thoroughly questioned her. Yoshioka then drove <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> parents and told them Puyi ordered her to study at the palace. Money was promised to the parents. She was subjected to a medical examination and then taken to Puyi's sister Yunhe and instructed in palace protocol. Two years later when Manchukuo collapsed, Li Yuqin shared a train with Empress Wanrong, who was experiencing opium withdrawal symptoms at the time. They were both arrested by the Soviets and sent to a prison in Changchun. Li Yuqin was released in 1946 and sent back home. She worked in a textile factory while she studied the works of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. In 1955 she began visiting Puyi in prison. After applying to the Chinese authorities for a divorce, the government responded on her next prison visit by showing her to a room with a double bed and ordered her to reconcile with Puyi, and she said the couple obeyed the order. She divorced Puyi in May 1957. She later married a technician, and had two sons. During the Cultural Revolution she became a target for attack by the Red Guards because she used to be Puyi's concubine. She died of liver problems in 2001.|$|E

500|$|While walking home, Marty {{experiences}} {{a vision of}} Gotts attacking Forester. Marty eventually makes {{her way to the}} crime scene where she finds the victim's body. She returns to the police station and confesses to the murders. To convince the police that she is the murderer, Marty tells Pennock where Gotts hid the heroin he stole from the first victim, but none of the prints on the heroin belong to Marty, furthering Mulder's argument that she is, in fact, innocent. Mulder approaches Marty and tells her that he researched her mother's murder—she died from a stab wound to the kidney, the same way Gotts kills his victims. Mulder concludes that Marty was given her ability when her then-pregnant mother was killed by Gotts; it is revealed that Gotts is actually Marty's father and that he had spent thirty years (her whole life) in prison until being paroled. Marty sends Mulder and Scully to the bar that Gotts was last seen at, while Pennock takes <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> apartment to pick up some things before entering protective custody. While packing, Marty has a vision of Gotts in the apartment lobby; she knocks Pennock out, takes his gun and waits. [...] Mulder figures out that Marty had been experiencing Gotts' sight for the thirty years he was in prison; in effect spending her whole life in prison. Mulder and Scully arrive at Marty's apartment to find Gotts dead by his daughter's hands.

500|$|... "Borderline" [...] {{was filmed}} on {{location}} in Los Angeles, California from January 30 to February 2, 1984 {{and was the first}} video that Madonna made with director Mary Lambert, who later also directed the videos [...] "Like a Virgin", [...] "Material Girl", [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". Author Allen Metz noted how the video portrayed Madonna's then [...] "burgeoning star quality". It is regarded as one of her career-making moments when the video was started to be shown on MTV. She acted as the girlfriend of a Hispanic street guy who is picked up by a British photographer who publishes her picture on a magazine cover. The portrayal of the street life and high-fashion scene in the video was a reference to Madonna's life in the gritty, multiracial streets and clubs that she used to haunt while her career was beginning, as well as the world of popularity and success she was experiencing at that moment. The storyline involved her being emotionally torn between the photographer and her boyfriend. Madonna's boyfriend in the video is portrayed as Latino, and her struggles with this relationship depicted the struggle Hispanic women faced with their men. Lambert said that there was [...] "no formula" [...] used when making the [...] "Borderline" [...] video and that they were [...] "inventing it as we went along." [...] In the January 1997 issue of Rolling Stone, Lambert described the video and its plot as, [...] "Boy and girl enjoy simple pleasures of barrio love, girl is tempted by fame, boy gets huffy, girl gets famous, but her new beau's out-of-line reaction to a behavioral trifle (all she did was to spray-paint his expensive sports car) drives <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> true love." ...|$|E
