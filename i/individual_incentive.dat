The ever-growing complications of civilisation create for us new services which have to be undertaken by the State, and create for us {{an expansion of the}} existing services. There is a growing feeling, which I entirely share, against allowing those services which are in the nature of monopolies to pass into private hands. There is a pretty steady determination, which I am convinced will become effective in the present Parliament, to intercept all future unearned increment which may arise from the increase in the speculative value of the land. There will be an ever-widening area of municipal enterprise. I go farther; I should like to see the State embark on various novel and adventurous experiments, I am delighted to see that Mr. Burns is now interesting himself in afforestation. I am of opinion that the State should increasingly assume the position of the reserve employer of labour. I am very sorry we have not got the railways of this country in our hands. We may do something better with the canals, and we are all agreed, every one in this hall who belongs to the Progressive Party, that the State must increasingly and earnestly concern itself with the care of the sick and the aged, and, above all, of the children.|$|E

We combine these two stylized facts and hypothesize that men and women differ in how they rate their co-worker relationships when they work under <b>individual</b> <b>incentives,</b> group incentives, or a combination of the two. This hypothesis is explored using survey data on 14, 743 highly educated employees from 78 different organizations in the Netherlands.

50|$|The notion that, in a democracy, the {{greatest}} {{concern is that}} the majority will tyrannise and exploit diverse smaller interests, has been criticised by Mancur Olson in The Logic of Collective Action, who argues instead that narrow and well organised minorities are more likely to assert their interests over those of the majority. Olson argues that when the benefits of political action (e.g., lobbying) are spread over fewer agents, there is a stronger <b>individual</b> <b>incentive</b> to contribute to that political activity. Narrow groups, especially those who can reward active participation to their group goals, might therefore be able to dominate or distort political process, a process studied in public choice theory.|$|E

The threat of theft was almost nonexistent, since little was held by the individual except basic tools and implements that were so prevalent they had little value.

40|$|ForthcomingWe {{examine how}} {{incentive}} systems influence knowledge transfer between group members with equal or different status who solve an interdependent task. In our experiment, group members receive group or <b>individual</b> <b>incentives,</b> while status is manipulated by assigning job titles with corresponding role descriptions. Although all conditions require knowledge sharing to maximize payoffs, our {{results suggest that}} significantly more knowledge is shared under group <b>incentives</b> relative to <b>individual</b> <b>incentives</b> when status differences are present, whereas the amount of knowledge shared does not differ across these incentive manipulations for equal-status groups.

Instead, group incentives are required to induce cooperative behavior that mitigates the negative effects of status differences on knowledge sharing.

40|$|Relational Contracts as a Foundation for Bonus Pools Abstract: Much of our {{thinking}} about (and criticism of) {{the relationship between}} pay and performance seems {{to be based on}} a standard principal-agent model of <b>individual</b> <b>incentives.</b> In this paper, we instead explore incentives provided to a team of agents and the role mutual monitoring and collusion play in determining the optimal provision of incentives. A key feature of this paper’s model relative to other models of team incentives (e. g., Arya, Fellingham, and Glover, 1997; Che and Yoo, 2001) is that the rewards are discretionary/based (at least in part) on non-verifiable information. If the performance measures were objective and contracts explicit, the principal would use joint performance evaluation (JPE) to motivate the agents to mutually monitor and motivate each other. When the non-verifiability problem is a pressing one and Pure JPE is no longer feasible, the principal might try to substitute <b>individual</b> <b>incentives</b> for mutual monitoring incentives by using relative performance evaluation (RPE). However, RPE undoes some of the mutual monitoring incentives created by JPE, so even greater (more costly) <b>individual</b> <b>incentives</b> are needed. The substitution of individual for mutual monitoring incentives is particularly costly when the agents are patient (have a low discount rate), since this is th...|$|R
