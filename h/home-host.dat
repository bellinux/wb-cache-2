We test hypotheses about {{the role of}} country-level alliances and firm internationalisation with comprehensive longitudinal multi-industry data on 623 acquisitions made by Indian multinational enterprises (MNEs) between 2000 and 2007 on a panel of 65 host countries. The results show that country alliances reduce the transaction costs arising from the distance between <b>home-host</b> countries, thereby positively influencing the internationalisation of Indian MNEs. However, the extent of that influence depends upon the nature of the alliance. Our findings have significant implications for public policy and theory...|$|E

40|$|Research on how {{multinational}} firms {{deal with}} <b>home-host</b> cultural differences argues that cultural differences are minimized and assumes that foreign cultures are homogenous. In this paper we relax the cultural homogeneity assumption. In {{the presence of}} cultural variation in host countries the minimization of cultural differences leads existing mean-based indices of cultural differences to overestimate the actual cultural differences these firms have to deal with. We test this argument in a 25 -year panel analysis of total US multinationals' foreign sales in 54 host countries. At the sample average of cultural variation, the use of mean cultural difference indices yields a 74 % overestimate of the actual cultural difference effect. This suggests that <b>home-host</b> cultural differences are a substantially smaller barrier to multinational sales than hitherto assumed. The assumption of cultural homogeneity leads to conclusions in which a too large role is attributed to cultural differences. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Understanding how {{decisions}} for international investments {{are made and}} how this affects the overall pattern of investments and firm’s performance is of particular importance both in strategy and international business research. This dissertation introduced first <b>home-host</b> country relatedness (HHCR) as {{the degree to which}} countries are efficiently combined within the investment portfolios of firms. It theorized and demonstrated that HHCR will vary with the motivation for investments along at least two key dimensions: the nature of foreign investments and the connectedness of potential host countries {{to the rest of the}} world. ^ Drawing on cognitive psychology and decision-making research, it developed a theory of strategic decision making proposing that strategic solutions are chosen close to a convenient anchor. Building on research on memory imprinting, it also proposed that managers tend to rely on older knowledge representation. In the context of international investment decisions, managers use their home countries as an anchor and are more likely to choose as a site for foreign investments host countries that are ‘close’ to the home country. These decisions are also likely to rely more strongly on closeness to time invariant country factors of historic and geographic nature rather than time-variant institutions. Empirical tests using comprehensive investments data by all public multinational companies (MNC) worldwide, or over 15, 000 MNCs with over half a million subsidiaries, support the claims. ^ Finally, the dissertation introduced the concept of International Coherence (IC) defined as the degree to which an MNE’s network comprises countries that are related. It was hypothesized that maintaining a high level of coherence is important for firm performance and will enhance it. Also, the presence of international coherence mitigates some of the negative effects of unrelated product diversification. Empirical tests using data on foreign investments of over 20, 000 public firms, while also developing a <b>home-host</b> country relatedness index for up to 24, 300 <b>home-host</b> pairs, provided support for the theory advanced. ...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{argues that}} the effect of {{corruption}} on foreign ownership is not necessarily linear and depends on the level of host corruption. So long as the expected returns from foreign investments exceed its expected costs, higher host corruption will be associated with higher foreign ownership. However, costs may exceed or exactly compensate the returns to foreign investment at very high level of corruption, giving rise to negative or even an insignificant relationship when positive and negative effects outweigh each other. Further, we argue that this non-linear corruption effects may arise from multinational firms' attempts to investing in countries with similar environment and/or ensuring some formal networking with host countries in a bid to limit the damages caused by high level of host corruption. Panel fixed effects estimates (after correcting for foreign entry selection) using a recent large <b>home-host</b> matched panel data from central and eastern European host countries provide some support to these hypotheses: (i) higher corruption is associated with significantly higher foreign ownership unless corruption is at its fourth quartile value. (ii) There is also some confirmation that this non-linear corruption effects is linked to parent firms' attempts to ensure institutional similarity while investing in corrupt host countries: in particular, foreign multinationals from EU/OECD home countries tend to hold higher ownership in EU/OECD host countries and also when the <b>home-host</b> relative corruption distance is small...|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} in {{addition}} to host corruption per se, as accounted for by the existing literature, an explanation of inter-country variation in FDI needs to account for the distance between the host and home corruption, which we call relative corruption. We use a large matched <b>home-host</b> firm-level panel data-set for 1998 - 2006 from CEE transition countries. Year-specific selectivity corrected estimates suggest that, ceteris paribus, higher relative ‘grand’ corruption lowers foreign ownership as the returns to investment tends to be lower in more corrupt environment. However, after controlling for the selectivity bias, knowledge- intensive parent firms are found to hold controlling ownership, as the difficulty of successful joint venture looms large in more corrupt environment.

40|$|Using {{a recent}} Spanish {{database}} on immigrants from {{all across the}} globe, we show that remittances respond to differences in macroeconomic conditions at home and abroad.

These patterns differ with ownership of home country assets and with {{the area of the}} globe from which immigrants originate, whether it is Africa, the Americas, Europe or Asia. The response of remittances to cross-country differences in portfolio variables suggests that remittances may not be counter-cyclical as often claimed.

This study has three key features, which are different from the approaches adopted in previous studies. It expands the existing <b>home-host</b> standardization framework from the “country ” to the “city ” market perspective and fo-cuses on the standardization/adaptation strategy used by service firms. This is a research theme which is still under development. This study has successfully uncovered a significant relationship between marketing standardization strategy and strategic objectives, in the service sector. Based on the findings of its statistical analysis, a “city ” market standardization/adaptation-performance framework is proposed. In the framework, the factors affecting service firms ’ choice of standard-ization/adaptation strategy and their subsequent influence on performance are identified. The find-ings from this study offer some new insights into research concerning marketing standardization/ adaptation strategy. Its results have implications for marketing managers, researchers and those who are interested in conducting business in China. doi: 10. 1300 /J 042 v 20 n 01 _ 04 [Article copies availabl...|$|E

Their aspirational mobility is encouraged by their experiences in Australia in terms of their ability to form friendship networks with fellow international students rather than with locals, and their sense of belonging to the home nation through rapid developments in communication and media technologies...|$|E

The paper has been prepared by an expert group of staff from the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) in which experts from EU candidate and {{potential candidate country}} central banks also participated. The paper finds that near-term challenges to {{financial stability}} primarily relate to credit risks from the generally weak economic dynamics in combination with already high non-performing loan burdens in many banking systems, especially in the Western Balkans.

This study {{contributes to the literature}} on the importance of institutional distance between home and host country among the factors able to infl uence FDI. The novelty of our paper is that (1) we consider whether institutional distance matters also when the host country is already endowed with institutional standards relatively close to those of the main home countries of MNEs, and (2) we run separate investigations of <b>home-host</b> countries’ institutional distance, distinguishing between institutionally safer and less safe home countries in comparison with the host ones. The Czech Republic has been chosen in view of these perspectives, as (1) it has traditionally been considered {{as one of the most}} developed markets among those emerged from the socialist experience, its level of institutional development is close to that of the various home countries of MNEs, and (2) besides hosting MNEs from home countries endowed with safer institutions, it receives a  certain amount of FDI also from countries with a  relatively less safe institutional environment.

40|$|International Trade and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) {{have grown}} at fast paces {{during the last}} decades. At this point, however, {{it is not clear}} whether trade and {{investment}} are regarded by firms as complementary ways of accessing other markets, or, instead, if they are employed as alternative strategies. This paper examines this issue empirically, for the particular case of Europe, an area in which commercial and economic integration has gained remarkable momentum since 1992. More specifically, it tests whether the reduction of trade barriers over time among the members of the European Union (EU) has increased not only trade flows but also FDI within those countries. A gravity model is estimated using the Hausman-Taylor estimation technique—to circumvent time invariability and endogeneity—for intra Europe FDI and, separately, for FDI to the EU members with origin in third countries. In addition to trade integration measures, this paper also analyzes the potential role of other traditional determinants of FDI, as the market size of the host country and the cost differential among <b>home-host</b> economies. The results suggest that EU commercial integration and FDI reinforce each other, thus being complements rather than substitutes in Europe. This effect is apparent for the intra-EU FDI and also for investment coming from countries outside the EU. Cost differentials are not as relevant as the possibility of gaining market share which leads us to conclude that in the EU the FDI pattern follows a horizontal strategy rather than a FDI vertical model...|$|E
40|$|The present {{crisis has}} {{revealed}} that, as expected, {{much of the}} safety net for handling failures in the banking system is deficient, particularly for cross-border banks, and the present problems had to be handled by a range of ad hoc measures. The principal new measure {{that needs to be}} undertaken in most countries is the implementation of a satisfactory special resolution regime for banks. This paper, however, deals with two further steps that could assist the operation of the safety net. The first is to ensure earlier intervention so there is more time to put a satisfactory rescue or resolution in place. The second is to implement a regime of prompt corrective action (structured early intervention and resolution, SEIR) so that both supervisors and banks know that a regime of increasing intensity will take place according to a strict timetable that will end in the authorities stepping into the bank while it still has positive capital, if the earlier stages are not effective. The paper evaluates the means of doing this in a European environment making use of the experience in the United States. It concludes that, while a lot can be done even within the current framework of national supervision, particularly through pre-positioning, cross-border banks can be better treated either by revising the <b>home-host</b> responsibilities or by moving to a supranational level of responsibility for SEIR for those banks whose continued operation is considered necessary for financial stability in any member state. early intervention; prompt corrective action; cross-border banks; pre-positioning; bank resolution...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{bilateral cooperation}} between developed countries (home country) {{and developing countries}} (host country) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to enhance carbon dioxide sinks. With the <b>home-host</b> country pair as the unit of analysis, our logistic regression model examines 158 Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) investment projects from 1993 until 2002 across 2541 country-pairs. Because the marginal costs of reducing emissions may be lower in developing countries, the AIJ projects served as a policy laboratory to assess whether such investments might be advantageous to both countries in the event future regimes allowed emission credits from such bilateral projects. Instead of investing in home countries where maximum pollution reductions (or carbon sequestration) might be possible, home countries invest in locations where they can conduct their policy experiments at low transaction costs. Prior trade and aid relationships were used as a proxy. Regarding energy projects, location decisions are driven by home countries’ desire to reduce air pollution that they receive from abroad. Geography – proximity of a host country to a home country – in interaction with host country's coal production, {{is a very important}} driver of location decision in AIJ energy sector projects. Location of sequestration projects is impacted by the host country's potential for avoiding deforestation as well as by previous aid and trade patterns between a home and a host country.

40|$|Following {{the case}} study {{research}} strategy, this thesis has investigated the implementation of corporate environmental policies in subsidiaries of transnational corporations in Brazil. More specifically, it investigated six subsidiaries from three countries of origin - the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany - operating in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. This comparative study {{has resulted in a}} theoretical framework to explain transnational corporations' environmental practices. This framework follows an interdisciplinary approach, consisting of four levels. First, at the international level, an overview of the constraints regarding transnational corporations and environmental issues is addressed. The second level is represented by the environmental regulatory policies in the home and host countries. The third level accessed the influences from the industry's structure (in both international and Brazilian contexts). Finally, the fourth level is centred on the companies, which specifically discusses the <b>home-host</b> dilemma in the management of transnational corporations. The most important conclusion is that the main source of pressure over subsidiaries' practices is the environmental regulation of the host country. Nevertheless, there are cases of non-compliance and cases of overcompliance regarding Brazilian environmental legislation. However, these contradictory results are explained by the headquarters-subsidiary relationship. That is, poor environmental performance was explained by lack of control from the headquarters. Otherwise, good performance was explained by tight control from headquarters over subsidiaries' practices in Brazil. Additionally, there is indication that regulation is the main driving force in the home countries. However, attempts at self-regulation are in progress in the chemical industry in order to balance these external pressures for environmental improvements. Finally, there is evidence that the nationality of the selected companies is a relevant aspect of their environmental policies and practices. This is mainly because the legal requirements and management approach of the home countries are incorporated into their environmental management...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{financial}} stability {{challenges in the}} EU candidate countries: Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey. It follows a macro-prudential approach, emphasising systemic risks and the stability of financial systems as a whole. The paper recalls that the economies of all three countries experienced a recession in 2008 - 09 and shows how this slowed the rapid process of financial deepening that had been taking place {{since the beginning of}} the last decade. The deteriorating economic and financial conditions manifested themselves, first and foremost, through a marked deterioration in asset quality. These direct credit risks were compounded by the transformation of exchange and interest rate risks through a widespread use of foreign exchange-denominated or indexed loans and variable or adjustable interest rate loans. Moreover, funding and liquidity risks also materialised to some extent, although fully fledged bank runs were avoided, and none of the countries experienced a sharp reversal in external financing. Overall, the deterioration in asset quality has so far been managed well by the banking systems of the candidate countries, facilitated by large capital buffers, pro-active macro-prudential policies pursued by the authorities both before and during the crisis and the relative stability of exchange rates. Looking ahead, although uncertainties remain high regarding credit quality, the shock-absorbing capacities of the banking systems are fairly robust, as also evidenced by their relative resilience so far. Nevertheless, as the economic recovery sets in, the central banks should return to and possibly reinforce the implementation of measures to avoid a pro-cyclical build-up of credit asset) boom-bust cycles. Furthermore, given the relevance of foreign-owned banks in two of the three countries, a continued strengthening of <b>home-host</b> cooperation in the supervisory area will be crucial to avoid any kind of regulatory arbitrage.

40|$|Emerging economy governments {{commit to}} protect the {{property}} rights of foreign firms {{through a variety of}} contracts, from treaties to direct agreements. In an era of liberalized capital flows, these contracts are thought to be self-enforcing: the fear of capital exit compels governments to honor their obligations. But extraordinary variation in contract sanctity in countries around the world suggests the inadequacy of this view. This dissertation seeks to explain the varying pressures on emerging economy governments to honor or break contracts with foreign firms. I find that foreign firms' national origins {{play a key role in}} their contract sanctity. Firms of the same nationality are more likely to share political risks thanks to a variety of institutional and historical factors specific to the <b>home-host</b> country relationship. Co- national firms can also uniquely access diplomatic support. Shared risks and resources make firms more likely to act in ways costly to the host government when a co-national firm's contract is broken. In contrast, firms are likely indifferent to breach with firms of another nationality. These firm-level reactions generate a counterintuitive result in the host country as a whole. The more diverse foreign firms' national origins, the more space a host government has to compromise one national group's contract sanctity without threatening broader capital access. Using quantitative analysis, I demonstrate that firms differentially draw down FDI after government breach of contract with co-national firms. I also use over 130 interviews with foreign investors in Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania to demonstrate that co-national actors' protests are stronger and more effective when the foreign investor community is less nationally diverse. The theory offered here takes seriously the bilateral relationship embedded in each foreign investment transaction. Far from having faded from relevance in a world of economic globalization, bilateral relations shape foreign firm and diplomatic responses to breach. Because host governments breach contracts with certain foreign firms and are met with indifference by others, nationality diversity can be a liability to investors while providing an opening for governments to prioritize other goals over the property and preferences of foreign capital. by Rachel L.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] and profitability objectives are becoming more relevant for Chinese firms as they expand their business operations on the African continent, where the political environment often exposes the firms to high political risk. Political risk analysis is increasingly important {{as a way of}} identifying, assessing and addressing the issue of political risk. This study explores the political risk factors that may influence the operations of Chinese firms operating in Africa. Economic development, social development, political instability, corruption and political violence are host country factors that may shape the African political environment and foreign business firms’ exposure to political risk. Company-specific factors may have a negative or positive impact on the exposure of Chinese firms to the host country’s political risk environment in Africa. Firstly, the size, ownership and the relationship of the firm with the home government may influence a firm’s bargaining power in a host country. Large and diversified firms, especially Chinese state-owned enterprises in strategic sectors generally have more bargaining power than small firms. Secondly, company resources such as capital, experience and technical expertise may give a company a competitive advantage over other firms, especially when the host country lack in these areas. Thirdly, the political behaviour of firms such as partnership formation with the government may be beneficial to business operations. However, in unstable countries this may pose a risk to Chinese firms being targeted or losing contracts in cases of regime change. Fourthly, the more the country is economically dependent on the company or the home country, the more bargaining power the company has and it is less likely that the government would intervene. African countries may become more and more economically dependent on China as China-African trade relations expand and Chinese concessional loans become more relevant to African countries. Fifth, a firm’s reputational risk may be influenced by firm culture, its response to corporate social responsibility, environmental concerns and labour issues. Chinese firms generally have the reputation of having a more top-down business culture and not integrating corporate social responsibility, environmental concerns and labour issues into their business operations. Lastly, because an international business firm may be associated with its home country, the <b>home-host</b> country government relations may influence the firm’s political risk exposure. While this association may have negative consequences for Chinese firms in some cases, China’s increasing involvement in African diplomatic relations, peacekeeping missions and association with the African Union may add to China’s image in Africa as a responsible power sensitive to African security.

40|$|As {{the scope}} and {{importance}} {{of the global economy}} expands, the international business arena presents continuous challenges in the governance of multinational enterprises (MNEs). Chief among these challenges is the management of the turbulent milieu in which world commerce is conducted and, as a result, academic inquiry into the environmental dimensions of international management has increased. The focus of this academic attention however, has been primarily concerned with MNEs from developed countries (DCs) which establish operations in other industrialised economies. In relative terms, there has been insufficient research into DC based organisations involved in less developed countries (LDCs). This dearth of inquiry is particularly evident in the rapidly expanding island economies of the South-west Pacific. Accordingly, the aim of this thesis is to extend current understanding of international management in the volatile and diverse context of LDCs. To this end, the management of Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL), an Australian mining company which operated in Papua New Guinea's North Solomons Province, was investigated. Using a single case study approach, inductive and deductive processes were applied in order to comprehend the reality of BCL's complex relationship with its host country and host society. Extant literature formed the conceptual framework of the study, from which the central and subordinate research questions were framed. Primary data were gathered from interviews with past executives of BCL, with secondary material assembled from company documents, published histories, news articles, PNG and Australian government reports and prior studies of Bougainville. A broad verification process was instituted to ensure the rigour of the data and the interpretive process which followed. The research findings support claims in the literature that corporate performance is dependent upon the close alignment of elements within the internal and external environments of MNEs. However, it was determined that alignment becomes increasingly difficult as the business climate in the host setting deviates from that in the home country, and MNE activities cannot be sustained under extremely divergent <b>home-host</b> conditions despite management's efforts to control external and organisation-specific variables. It was further established that MNE management should focus environmental congruency on the host · society, rather than on the host country as suggested in the literature. Evidence from the research reveals that the immediate population is the most influential contextual factor for MNEs, particularly in LDCs of the South-west Pacific which are typified by ethnic identity and local attachments which take precedence over the abstract notion of nationhood. The outcomes of this thesis present a range of implications concerning the management of MNEs in LDCs in terms of policy development, management practice and theory development, as well as suggesting possibilities for further research in the subject field...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses several global expansion {{challenges faced}} by multinational hotel companies due to the dramatic increase of international travel. Grounded in theories pertaining to brand equity, this study develops the consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) model for multinational hotel brands. The model examines the effects of brand knowledge, operationalized as brand awareness and brand image, on consumer response to the brand. The conceptual model is empirically tested using {{a sample of the}} Chinese middle-class consumers in their home country - China and when they travel to the foreign country or host country - the United States. Three U. S. -based multinational hotel brands are selected: Hilton, Holiday Inn, and Super 8. Three dimensions of hotel brand image are identified based on website content analysis of these hotel brands and related literature. The three dimensions are Tangibles, Intangibles 2 ̆ 6 Prestige, and General Evaluation. Consumer response is represented by Brand Resonance in the China model and Behavioral Intention in the U. S. model. In addition, to extend the understanding of CBBE model in the hospitality and tourism realm, this dissertation investigates the role of travel motivation in CBBE model. Three factors of Chinese consumers 2 ̆ 7 motivation for traveling from China to the United States have been identified and examined {{for each of the three}} sub-samples corresponding to three hotel brands. ^ The major findings from this study include: 1) Differential relationship patterns between brand knowledge and consumer response are demonstrated in CBBE models among three brands. 2) Distinctive relationship patterns between brand knowledge and consumer response across two countries are exhibited for Hilton and Holiday Inn brands, but not for Super 8 brand. 3) For China CBBE models across three brands, the relationship between Intangibles 2 ̆ 6 Prestige and Brand Resonance is significantly positive, while no relationship exists between Tangibles and Brand Resonance. 4) For Hilton and Holiday Inn brands, Image dimension of Intangibles 2 ̆ 6 Prestige pertaining symbolic values in consumption is important for Chinese consumers when they are in their home country of China but not in the host country of the United States. Tangibles or General Evaluations reflecting functional values are perceived more important in U. S. models than in China models. 5) Chinese consumers 2 ̆ 7 motivation for traveling from China to the United States has moderating effects on the relationship between brand image and behavioral intention in the United States. Varied travel motivation factors have different influences on how brand image affects behavioral intention, across three hotel brands. ^ This study extends the body of knowledge on consumer-based brand equity to hospitality and tourism realm in the context of globalization. The <b>home-host</b> framework presented in this study sheds new light on the way to understand and address global branding {{challenges faced by}} hospitality and tourism industry. The findings inform the multinational hotel companies of Chinese middle-class consumers 2 ̆ 7 understanding of and response toward the multinational hotel brands in the home country of China and host country of the United States, which can be attributed to their unique cultural roots and values. The findings caution multinational hotel companies to be discreet about their global branding strategies given today 2 ̆ 7 s booming international travel. As more Chinese leisure travelers are coming to the United States, how these multinational hotel companies understand and host these guests in their home country requests more inquiries in academic research and practice. ...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to establish the challenges and implications of implementing Basel II in developing countries, with particular focus on the Zimbabwean banking system. The main objective is to identify the problems being confronted by banks and the supervisory authority in Zimbabwe, being the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, in their journey to Basel II implementation. This purpose arose from the publication on 26 June 2004 of the â€œInternational Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards, a Revised Frameworkâ€, commonly known as Basel II, which has been adopted for implementation by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe set 1 January 2013 as the implementation date for Basel II after which Basel I will no longer be used in Zimbabwe. Banking institutions in Zimbabwe have been focusing their attention on becoming Basel II compliant since 2012, wherein they started conducting parallel run of the present framework i. e. Basel I with the Basel II rules. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe announced in January 2013 that banks will continue with the parallel through 2013, as banks were at various stages of implementing Basel II and there were weaknesses identified which were being addressed. As such Basel II capital rules were not implemented in full as at 1 January 2013 as initially envisaged by the central bank. Very little attention has been paid on the challenges and implications of Basel II confronting the Zimbabwean banking system. A literature study was undertaken which included a review of the Basel II framework, impact studies, and a review of the relevant literature on the topic. The framework was studied in order to determine the major challenging themes and implications on developing country banks. Once these challenging themes were identified, the literature on those areas of impact was researched. The study of the Basel II framework identified a number of challenges that banks in developing countries will face. The first implication is that developing countries that choose to adopt Basel II standards will do so at a considerable cost to both their regulators and the banking sectors. Basel II presents a huge compliance burden. Large banks who are able to bear high compliance costs will survive, whilst the smaller banks will be discouraged. Secondly the perceived benefits of investing in Basel II are likely to be minimal because the new capital rules were not designed for, nor are they appropriate for developing economies. In addition, local banks in developing countries will face capital constraints, making them susceptible to mergers and acquisitions by sophisticated international banks that are able to inject fresh capital and bring in the necessary expertise sought by the regulators. Another difficult aspect of implementation is the cross border challenges. Banks that have cross border operations are more likely concerned with <b>home-host</b> supervisory issues largely emanating from differences in implementation timetables; approaches to implementation and interpretation of Basel II. Another serious challenge is that the success of Basel II depends on strong and well developed financial systems, which include among others, existing regulatory and supervisory frameworks; sustainability of banking sector reforms; existing level of economic development; political stability; depth and efficiency of financial intermediation; a number of which lack developing countries Notwithstanding the foregoing, many developing countries feel they are left with no choice but to adopt Basel II, as without it developed country regulators may deny their banks market access. Thus developing countries are in a â€œCatch- 22 â€ situation; compliance implies that developing country local banks may make themselves vulnerable to take-over by advanced international banks; non-compliance would evade this, however, they would be excluded from international financial markets. This will have serious implications on globalization efforts, in particular distribution of income as financial services play an essential role in post industrial economy. This paper investigates the challenges and implications of Basel II implementation in developing countries, specifically in Zimbabwe. It begins by giving a brief background of the Zimbabwean banking system and an overview of Basel I and Basel II. This is followed by a discussion of the implications and challenges of Basel II and the reasons for its widespread adoption in developing countries...|$|E
40|$|In {{the realm}} of globalization, {{international}} sourcing of services contributes to reshape firm’s value chains as the physical dispersion of these activities increases. This reorganization does not simply lead to the replication of domestic activities in a destination providing resource advantages, but, in most cases, it implies profound modifications of the flows of activities, including the reconsideration of {{the boundaries of the}} firm. Global sourcing strategies, also called offshoring, seek to increase firm’s efficiency by combining the exploitation of foreign locational advantages with process redesign. When aggregated, these firm-level strategies translate into considerable international exchanges to a point that flows of intermediate services represent about 73 % of the total of international trade in services for 2005 (OECD, 2009). These activities present a high degree of heterogeneity in terms of functions concerned, the related domestic industries, motivations, destinations, organizational structure or scope. This wave of internationalization, because of its relative novelty, growth and rapid diversification, draws the interest from the public, political and academic spheres but the comprehension of the determinants shaping the configuration and organization of these activities still remain largely unknown. Based on four essays, this PhD thesis addresses the impact of host-country characteristics and distance factors on the configuration of international sourcing activities in the dimensions of location, governance model and scope of activities. The first paper studies the country-specific determinants of the interdependent choices of destination and governance model in the global sourcing of services. I explore the simultaneity of these decisions and I jointly estimate their determinants using implementation-level data. Derived from comparative advantages, host-country uncertainty and the global dispersion of tasks, I present three classes of factors driving global sourcing configurations: resource arbitrages, host-country risk and communication barriers. Empirical results confirm that locations with resource or capabilities advantages specific to services – low labour cost, education and labour supply – attract more offshoring activities. However the pursued resource advantages differ depending on the governance model. Country attractiveness for captive implementations presents a higher positive sensitivity to the education-intensive resources, while outsourcing strategies have a greater cost-cutting orientation coming from labour cost arbitrages. Furthermore, the risks inherent to the host-country, in the form of weak formal institutions and inexperience in the destination, have the dual effect of deterring location attractiveness, while they foster the adoption of the outsourcing model compared to the captive one. Communication barriers coming from geographic distance, cultural and linguistic differences have the simultaneous effect of discouraging global sourcing in those locations while, to overcome these constraints, firms favor higher integration with the use of captive models. This second paper further explores the mechanisms through which <b>home-host</b> country distances affect the choice of governance mode in service offshoring. Using a Transaction Cost Economics approach, I explore the comparative costs of the hierarchical and contractual models to show that different dimensions of distance (geographic, cultural and institutional), because they generate different types of uncertainties, impact offshore governance choices in different ways. Empirical results confirm that, on the one hand, firms are more likely to respond to internal uncertainties resulting from geographic and cultural distance by leveraging the internal controls and collaboration mechanisms of a captive offshore service center. On the other hand, they tend to respond to external uncertainties resulting from institutional distance by limiting their foreign commitment and leveraging the resources and local experience of third party service providers. Finally, I find that the temporal distance component (time zone difference) of geographical dispersion between onshore and offshore countries plays a dominant role over the spatial distance component. The third section then concentrates on the impact of the institutional environment (regulative) on international sourcing activities. To exploit country-specific advantages, firms that source activities from abroad are forced to integrate the institutional environment into the choice not only of host-country, but also of governance model for their offshore activities. Considering inefficient institutions as drivers of transaction costs, this conceptual paper explores the impact of the host-country regulative environment in the interdependent decisions of country selection and governance model (captive or outsourcing) in firms’ global sourcing strategies. I consider two classes of assets: transferred assets for knowledge/information flows, and local assets sourced from the host location. I show that each class involves specific institutional risks for offshoring practices. In turn, because of the different institutional exposures of the captive model and the outsourced one, the institutional risks associated with transferred and local assets have different implications for the choice of governance model. Firms react to institutional risks relative to transferred assets by internalizing their activity, but they bypass inefficient institutions for local assets using outsourcing. Based on the interaction of the institutional risks relative to each class of assets, I then obtain sufficient conditions that give the firm-optimal combinations of country selection and governance model. The last section studies how firm-level and country-level risks affect the scope of the process operated in the foreign unit. To prevent appropriation hazard for proprietary content, firms choose a particular disaggregation of the value chain. We argue that, in response to the lack of control offered by internalization and the lack of protection provided by host-country institutions for protecting proprietary content, firms reduce the scope of their activities. In other words, they exploit existing complementarities between the tasks of their value chain using a higher disaggregation of their process and therefore reducing appropriation value for outsiders. Based on a sample of 750 international sourcing projects, regression results on the scope of offshore activities confirm that firms prefer to source discrete tasks rather than entire processes when they lack the protection of internalization and external institutions. In addition, experience modifies these relationships. On the one hand, inexperienced firms do not rely on this slicing mechanism to prevent the loss of control implied by an outsourcing model. On the other hand, the effect of weak institutional protection is perceived as more stringent for inexperienced firms. When host-country institutions are deficient, these firms, compared to the experienced ones, have a higher propensity to operate discrete tasks rather than entire processes.
