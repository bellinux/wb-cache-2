The political discourse has, quite obviously, taken up the academic debate {{about the importance of}} <b>ideas</b> and <b>networks.</b> The Commission is seen as an ideational entrepreneur which by arguing and networking is able to induce autonomous actors with quite diverse interests to follow a European course of action. Regional policy has been a most promising field of research to confirm this hypothesis. Recent investigations can be read, however, in quite a different way. The paper questions established conventional wisdom concerning the importance of <b>European</b> <b>ideas</b> and <b>networks</b> for policy change and raises the question how ideational and network competition could be explored in a better way.
