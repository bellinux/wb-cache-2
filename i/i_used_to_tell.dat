He {{was the best}} writer for his age I've ever read. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him, 'I'll {{always be able to}} get someone to pay me for talking, and you'll always be able to get someone to pay you for writing.' When it came to writing, I felt like Salieri to Sam's Mozart. Sam wanted to direct film, but I think he was fated to write and be in front of the camera. He was starting to get work as an actor. He was in several national commercials. And acting wasn't even what he did best. Sam was a sure thing. It {{was just a matter of}} time before he made it big." ...|$|E

"Valentine, my love, is {{the best}} {{creature}} in the world," [...] rejoined the doctor, folding up the Rubbleford Mercury, and directing it for the post; [...] "but, as <b>I</b> often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> his poor father (who never would believe me), a little cracked.

5000|$|In an 2007 interview, poet-lyricist Gulzar {{with whom}} Kamleshwar had work in film career, noted about the novel, [...] "I had {{underlined}} so many sentences that were potential short stories or film material.

6000|$|... "Well, he'd {{only been}} with us three or four weeks; but I knew him rather well. Oddly enough, he'd taken a sort of fancy to me. He was such a nice, bright boy, so {{enthusiastic}} and simple. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him {{that he ought to}} have been at school, rather than roughing it at the Cape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it, and I don't mean to, but it's so {{much easier}} to get along if you ain't very fussy about being exactly true. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> 'em because I was afraid of father and Nicolo, and now I do {{sometimes}} because the boys laugh at me.

6000|$|Mr. Longdon {{listened with}} a visible recovery. [...] "He {{used to talk}} to me--I {{remember}} he asked me questions I couldn't answer and made me dreadfully ashamed. But I lent him books--partly, upon my honour, to make him think that as I had them I did know something.

Excuse me, but I am resting for a minute, this last pull is an uncommonly stiff one. <b>I</b> always <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> my dear old friend, Mrs. Massey, that she {{ought to have the}} hill cut away a bit just here.

5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> mythology <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. To me it felt like a painting that came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|R

"Well," [...] he said, with a man's simple {{pleasure}} in Miss Kingsbury's friendliness to his wife, [...] "that's the girl <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you about,--the rich {{one with the}} money in her own right, whom I met at the Hallecks'. She seemed to think you were about the thing, Marsh! I saw her eyes open as she came up, and I felt awfully proud of you; you never looked half so well. But why didn't you say something?" ...|$|E

60|$|A {{plan had}} {{occurred}} to me for passing the night, which I was going to carry into execution. This was, to lie behind the wall {{at the back of}} my old school, in a corner where there used to be a haystack. I imagined it would be a kind of company to have the boys, and the bedroom where <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the stories, so near me: although the boys would know nothing of my being there, and the bedroom would yield me no shelter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon," [...] said he, [...] "that your {{diagnosis}} about {{covers the}} case {{according to the}} rules laid down in the copy-books and historical readers.

5000|$|About this time, World War II {{broke out}} and many high school {{teenagers}} were being drafted and joining the Army. Bill had other ideas. [...] "Most people waited {{to be drafted}} and joined the Army. The Navy quota was full, and I decided I {{wanted to be a}} Marine like my father had been. He was a drill instructor and an officer at Parris Island (South Carolina) and at the officer training center in Quantico, VA during in World War <b>I.</b> He <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me stories about the Marine Corps so, on the basis of that I went down one day and asked to enlist." ...|$|R
2500|$|Classical and {{playback}} singer Manna Dey, who {{was also}} a contemporary of Rafi said, [...] "Rafi and I could sing everything, and he was such a gentleman. He was a better singer than me, and I will say this â€“ that no one came even close to him! He deserved everything he got! We had a great understanding and it was never about one-upmanship". Veteran actor Shammi Kapoor said, [...] "I am incomplete without Mohammad Rafi. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> often go for the recording of my song, which was sung by Mohammad Rafi, only because <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> like <b>telling</b> him how I would perform on this song on screen so that he can sing it that way. Even he liked my involvement".|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{and he will}} {{wash his}} hands of you. You do not know him as I do. He has taken it into his silly head {{that you are the}} chief of sinners because you said what was not true to that man, who seems really to be the sinner, and nothing will {{eradicate}} the idea. He will go and marry that woman because he thinks that in that way he can best carry his purpose, and then he will repent at leisure. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that you had better listen to the sermons." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were the}} lines which that noble Queen of Prussia, whom Napoleon treated with such coarse brutality, used to quote in her humiliation and exile; {{they were the}} lines my mother often quoted in the {{troubles}} of her later life. I absolutely declined to accept or admit the enormous truth hidden in them. I could not understand it. I remember quite well how <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her that I {{did not want to}} eat my bread in sorrow, or to pass any night weeping and watching for a more bitter dawn.|$|E
6000|$|On the {{platform}} <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a negro ghost story {{that had a}} pause {{in front of the}} snapper on the end, and that pause {{was the most important thing}} in the whole story. If I got it the right length precisely, I could spring the finishing ejaculation with effect enough to make some impressible girl deliver a startled little yelp and jump out of her seat--and that was what I was after. This story was called [...] "The Golden Arm," [...] and was told in this fashion. You can practice with it yourself--and mind you look out for the pause and get it right.|$|E
5000|$|Jung {{referred}} to his imaginative or visionary venture recorded in the [...] "Black Book" [...] journals as [...] "my most difficult experiment." [...] This experiment involved a voluntary confrontation with the unconscious through willful engagement of what Jung later termed [...] "mythopoetic imagination". The events and visions were recorded nightly in the [...] "Black Book" [...] journals. The journal record of this experience begins on 12 November 1913 with this petition, penned by Jung: My soul, my soul, where are you? Do you hear me? I speak, I call you-are you there? I have returned, I am here again. I have shaken the dust of all the lands from my feet, and I have come to you, I am with you. After long years of long wandering, I have come to you again.... Do you still know me? How long the separation lasted! Everything has become so different. And how did I find you? How strange my journey was! What words should <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you on what twisted paths a good star has guided me to you? Give me your hand, my almost forgotten soul. How warm the joy at seeing you again, you long disavowed soul. Life has led me back to you. ... My soul, my journey should continue with you. I will wander with you and ascend to my solitude.The record continues with increasing intensity through the summer of 1914. A hiatus in the journal entries came between June 1914 and late summer of 1915. During this period Jung drafted his first manuscript of Liber Novus.|$|R

5000|$|Baechler {{returned}} to New York City in 1980, {{where he was}} soon {{a part of a}} burgeoning Lower Manhattan arts scene, showing in the East Village and exhibition spaces such as Artists Space and the Drawing Center. [...] Baechler and Tony Shafrazi struck up an acquaintance over a shared interest in artist Joseph Kosuth. [...] Shafrazi was developing an interest in graffiti-oriented works, and founded a downtown gallery that represented Baechler, Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf and eventually Jean-Michel Basquiat. In a 2000 interview, Baechler said:Tony obviously had some grander vision {{about what was going on}} and decided that it wasn't the end of conceptualism, but the beginning of something else. I never felt entirely comfortable showing my work there because it had nothing to do with what Keith and Kenny Scharf were doing. I wasn't part of this downtown club scene, and I had nothing to do with so-called graffiti art ... <b>I</b> always <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> people, 'I'm an abstract artist before anything else,' For me, it's always been more about line, form, balance and the edge of the canvasâ€”all these silly formalist concernsâ€”than it has been about subject matter or narrative or politics.|$|R

If you had seen more places and more people, you would know what I mean when I {{say that there is}} {{something}} in the Florentines that reminds me of their cutting spring winds. I like people who take life less eagerly; and {{it would be good for}} my Romola, too, to see a new life. I should like to dip her a little in the soft waters of forgetfulness." ...|$|E

Old Stephen caught him {{stealing}} his oats one time and 'stead of giving him a taste of jail for it, as {{he ought to have}} done, he just took him right into his family and kept him there for three years. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him he'd be sorry for it, but he always persisted that Ben wasn't bad at heart and would come out all right some day. No matter what the young varmint did old Stephen would make excuses for him--'his ma was dead,' or he 'hadn't had no bringing-up.' I was thankful when he did finally clear out without doing some penitentiary work." ...|$|E

And Maura remembers being carried in to see poor Captain White just before he died, when she was getting better, but could not stand, and he said, [...] "Truth before all, children. Be true to God and man." [...] Captain White did care so much, but Mrs. White doesn't. Isn't that very odd, for she isn't a Roman Catholic?' ended Valetta, obviously believing that falsehood was inherent in Romanists, and pouring out all this as soon as her tears were assuaged, as if, having heard it, she must tell.|$|R

[...] "Ten years have elapsed," [...] said I, [...] "since I last spoke, and our two heroes, now gay young men, are revisiting the wrecked island of their childhood. 'Did we wreck ourselves,' said one, 'or was there someone to help us?' And the other who was the younger, replied, 'I think there was someone to help us, {{a man with a}} dog. <b>I</b> think he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me stories in the Kensington Gardens, but I forget all about him; I don't remember even his name.'" ...|$|R
40|$|My thesis {{offers the}} first full {{exploration}} of the literature and art associated with the Genoese noblewoman Simonetta Cattaneo Vespucci (1453 - 1476). Simonetta has gone down in legend {{as a model of}} Sandro Botticelli, and most scholarly discussions of her significance are principally concerned with either proving or disproving this theory. My point of departure, rather, is the series of vernacular poems that were written about Simonetta just before and shortly after her early death. <b>I</b> <b>use</b> them <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a new story, that of the transformation of the historical manna Simonetta into a cultural icon, a literary and visual construct who served the political, aesthetic and pecuniary agendas of her poets and artists. It is an account of the Florentine circles that <b>used</b> women <b>to</b> forge a collective sense of identity, of the emergence of Simonetta and her equally idealised peers as touchstones in contemporary debates regarding beauty and love, and of their corresponding lack of importance as 'real' women in the conservative republic in which they lived. In doing this, my thesis makes an important contribution to our understanding of how and why female beauty was commodified in the poetry and art of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Florence...|$|R
