5|$|In 1792, the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe, {{renamed the}} {{archipelago}} of islands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the St. Lawrence River for the victorious generals of the Conquest of Canada: Wolfe Island, Amherst Island, Howe Island, Carleton Island, and Gage Island. The last {{is now known}} as Simcoe Island.|$|E
5|$|The finless {{porpoise}} {{is known to}} also follow seasonal migrations. It is known that populations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Indus River migrate to the sea from April through October to feed on the annual spawning of prawns. In Japan, sightings of small pods of them herding sand lance onto shore are common year-round.|$|E
5|$|Anchored in Manila Bay, Cooke {{pretended that}} his ships were French vessels and {{successfully}} lured successive boatloads of Spanish officials aboard, taking them prisoner in turn. Once he had determined from his captives {{the state of}} defences in Manila, that the treasure ship had been unloaded at Cavite and that the Spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations, he sent a raiding party against a squadron of gunboats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Pasig River. Capturing the gunboats in a bloodless attack, Cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards, unsuccessfully assaulting Zamboanga before returning to Macau.|$|E

5|$|Calabria {{was built}} at the La Spezia dockyard, with her keel being laid down in February 1892. She was {{launched}} on 20 September 1894, and fitting-out work was completed by mid-1897; the new cruiser was commissioned into the Regia Marina (Royal Navy) on 12 July. Calabria spent long periods abroad in her first decade of service. She was operating in Chinese waters in 1899 when the Boxer Rebellion broke out. She joined an international fleet that included representatives from the fleets of the Eight Nation Alliance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Hai River while a contingent of 475 soldiers traveled to Beijing to reinforce the Legation Quarter.|$|E
5|$|Further {{measures}} included pouring {{boiling water}} over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could {{be placed in the}} mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> suspected vampires.|$|E
5|$|Her oft {{worn-out}} {{and poor}} condition contributed to her being wrecked when in June 1809 she grounded on an uncharted shoal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the River Plate, whilst seeking shelter {{with the rest}} of her squadron from a storm. All hands and most of the ship's stores were saved, but the condition of the ship's timbers made it impossible to free the ship; her captain was cleared of responsibility for the ship's loss thanks to documents detailing her defects. Recently, the wreck of Agamemnon has been located, and several artefacts have been recovered, including one of her cannons.|$|E

5|$|Schleswig-Holstein {{fought in}} both World Wars. During World War I, she saw front-line {{service in the}} II Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet, {{culminating}} in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916. Schleswig-Holstein saw action during the engagement, and was hit by one large-caliber shell. After the battle, Schleswig-Holstein was relegated to guard duty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Elbe River before being decommissioned in late 1917. As {{one of the few}} battleships permitted for Germany by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Schleswig-Holstein was again pressed into fleet service in the 1920s. In 1935, the old battleship was converted into a training ship for naval cadets.|$|E
5|$|She {{returned}} to Boston on 10 March {{for a short}} period in the Navy Yard. On 31March, she departed Boston for Hampton Roads where she arrived on 2April. The following morning, in response to the imminent threat of war with Germany, Wainwright began to search for submarines and to patrol Hampton Roads to protect the Fleet and naval bases. Two days later, other warships relieved her on patrol; and she anchored with the Fleet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the York River. The next day, 6April 1917, the United States entered World War I.|$|E
5|$|The Franco-Spanish squadron, {{comprising}} the 74-gun ships {{of the line}} Europa and Montañés, and the frigates Maria de la Cabeya and Luisa, accompanied by Preneuse and Brûle-Gueule, sailed from Manila on 6 January 1799, {{under the command of}} Rear-Admiral Ignacio Maria de Álava. Alava's squadron crossed the South China Sea in three weeks, arriving in the Wanshan Archipelago near Macau on 27 January 1799 with the intention of attacking shipping at Macau and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Pearl River. Alava had been informed of the presence of Intrepid by Danish merchants but was unaware of the arrival of Rainier's reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{is part of}} a cycle on the life of Saint Peter, and describes a scene from the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus directs Peter to find a coin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> a fish in order to pay the temple tax. It owes its importance in particular to its revolutionary use of perspective and chiaroscuro. The Tribute Money suffered great damage in the centuries after its creation, until the chapel went through a thorough restoration in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of undigested {{food in the}} stomach and seed pods still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> many of the specimens suggests neither starvation nor exposure are likely. The maturity of this ingested vegetation places {{the time of death}} in autumn rather than in spring, when flowers would be expected. The animals may have fallen through ice into small ponds or potholes, entombing them. Many are certainly known to have been killed in rivers, perhaps through being swept away by floods. In one location, by the Berelekh River in Yakutia in Siberia, more than 8,000 bones from at least 140 mammoths have been found in a single spot, apparently having been swept there by the current.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the Deutschland class {{continued}} {{to serve in}} the II Battle Squadron during World War I. The ships conducted patrols <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Elbe River in the first weeks of the war {{while the rest of the}} fleet was still being mobilized. They also took part in most of the major fleet actions in the first two years of the war. This primarily included acting as a support force for the battlecruisers that bombarded the English coast in the hopes of luring out a portion of the British fleet.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Mecklenburg {{and the rest of}} her class were mobilized to serve in the IV Battle Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt. The squadron was initially allocated to the North Sea, but was temporarily transferred to the Baltic in September. Starting on 3 September, the IV Squadron, assisted by the armored cruiser , conducted a sweep into the eastern Baltic {{in the direction of the}} Svenska Högarna islands. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. The squadron participated in a demonstration off Windau the next day. From 5 December to 2 April 1915, Mecklenburg and the rest of the squadron were assigned to guard duty in the North Sea, based <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Elbe.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Schwaben {{and the rest of}} her class were mobilized to serve in the IV Battle Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt. After it reached full combat readiness, the Squadron was employed both as a defense force in the German Bight—usually stationed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Elbe—and for operations in the Baltic. Starting on 3 September, the IV Squadron, assisted by the armored cruiser , conducted a sweep into the Baltic. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. In May 1915, IV Squadron, including Schwaben, was transferred to support the German Army in the Baltic Sea area. Schwaben and her sisters were then based in Kiel. During this period, she served as the flagship of the second command admiral of the Squadron, KAdm Alberts.|$|E
5|$|Another sortie {{into the}} North Sea {{followed}} on 19–20 October. On 21 December, Nassau ran aground <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Elbe. She {{was able to}} free herself, and repairs were effected in Hamburg at the Reihersteig Dockyard until 1 February 1917. The ship {{was part of the}} force that steamed to Norway to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy on 23–25 April, though the operation was canceled when the battlecruiser Moltke suffered mechanical damage and had to be towed back to port. Nassau, Ostfriesland, and Thüringen were formed into a special unit for Operation Schlußstein, a planned occupation of Saint Petersburg. On 8 August, Nassau took on 250 soldiers in Wilhelmshaven and then departed for the Baltic. The three ships reached the Baltic on 10 August, but the operation was postponed and eventually canceled. The special unit was dissolved on 21 August, and the battleships were back in Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd.|$|E

5|$|By 20:00 {{that evening}} {{a large number}} of South Koreans were {{retreating}} in disarray through a gap in the line held by the brigade, the majority of them moving through the Australians. The South Korean 6th Division later regrouped in positions behind 27th Brigade, but was now reduced to less than half its original strength. Meanwhile, as the 20th Army veered to the west as part of the Chinese main effort against Seoul, the Chinese 118th Division continued its secondary advance down the Kapyong Valley, closely pursuing the retreating South Koreans. Racing down the northeast running valley, the 354th Regiment reached the Australian positions by about 22:00. Intent on capturing the important crossroads of Route 17 south of Kapyong, and most likely unaware of the location of the Australian blocking position, the Chinese vanguard remained in the low ground, splitting as they approached a long, low north-south running ridge that rose like an island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the valley.|$|E
5|$|By December 1914, {{the ground}} forces Ocean {{supported}} had advanced to Al-Qurnah, at the juncture of the Euphrates and Tigris, allowing the Admiralty to recall Ocean for other purposes. She was accordingly stationed at Suez, Egypt, {{to assist in}} the defence of the Suez Canal, arriving there on 29 December. She anchored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> {{the southern end of the}} canal on 29 December and remained in that area until mid-January 1915, when she proceeded northward up the canal. On 3–4 February, she and the armed merchant cruiser Himalaya supported ground troops against an Ottoman attack on the canal in the vicinity of El Kubri. Later on the 3rd, after the Ottoman attack at El Kubri had been defeated, Ocean was sent to Deversoir to provide artillery support to the garrison there, but Ottoman attacks were insignificant.|$|E
5|$|Carabane, {{also known}} as Karabane, is an island and a village located in the extreme {{south-west}} of Senegal, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Casamance River. This relatively recent geological formation consists of a shoal and alluvium to which soil is added by accumulation in the branches and roots of the mangrove trees which cover most of the island. Along {{with the rest of}} Ziguinchor Region, Carabane has a tropical climate, cycling between a dry season and a wet season. The island was once considered an arid location where no useful plants were likely to grow, but it now supports several types of fruit tree, the most common of which are mangos and oranges. Although the nearby Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have been closed for years because of the Casamance Conflict, Carabane has continued to attract ornithologists interested in its wide variety of birds. Various species of fish are plentiful around the island, but there are very few mammals.|$|E
