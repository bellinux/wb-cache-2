The languages, which are exclusively oral, share a rich mythology, {{and it is}} thus possible to build a corpus of the same native narrative material in the three languages. The segments of similar semantic content are tagged with a "similarity" label to identify correspondences among the three language versions of the story. An interface has been developed to allow these similarities to be viewed together, {{in order to allow}} make possible comparison of the different lexical and morphosyntactic features of <b>each</b> language. A <b>concordancer</b> makes it possible to see the various occurrences of words or glosses, and to further compare and contrast the languages...|$|R

40|$|A semigroup is regular if it {{contains}} {{at least one}} idempotent <b>in</b> <b>each</b> -class and <b>in</b> <b>each</b> L-class. A regular semigroup is inverse if it satisfies either of the following equivalent conditions: (i) there is a unique idempotent <b>in</b> <b>each</b> -class and <b>in</b> <b>each</b> L-class, or (ii) the idempotents commute. Analogously, a semigroup is abundant if {{it contains}} at least one idempotent <b>in</b> <b>each</b> *-class and <b>in</b> <b>each</b> L*-class. An abundant semigroup is adequate if its idempotents commute. In adequate semigroups, there is a unique idempotent <b>in</b> <b>each</b> * and L*-class. M.
