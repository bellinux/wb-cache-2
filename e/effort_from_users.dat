The verification process can greatly benefit from human assistance through specification annotations, but this process requires intellectual <b>effort</b> <b>from</b> <b>users</b> and is error-prone.

Our approach will then refine the given annotation into a more complete specification by discovering missing constraints. The discovered constraints may involve both numerical and multi-set properties that could be later confirmed or revised by users. We further augment our approach by requiring partial specification to be given only for primary methods. Specifications for loops and auxiliary methods can then be systematically discovered by our augmented mechanism, with the help of information propagated from the primary methods. Our work is aimed at verifying beyond shape properties, with the eventual goal of analysing full functional properties for pointer-based data structures. Initial experiments have confirmed that we can automatically refine partial specifications with non-trivial constraints, thus making it easier for users to handle specifications with richer properties...|$|E
40|$|Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) play {{a crucial}} role in modern {{software}} development, acting as abstract building blocks that allow engineers to focus on what makes their programs unique without having to constantly Òreinvent the wheelÓ. While API authors convey how a method should be used via documentation, the text is delocalized from the source code that invokes that method, so its consumption requires additional <b>effort</b> <b>from</b> <b>users</b> of the API. This dissertation presents the notion of “directives”, important clauses in the documentation of some methods that demand action or attention from their callers. It then demonstrates via a lab study that developers who are writing or examining code invoking these methods may fail to notice these clauses in the documentation text, or even to read the text at all. This lack of awareness precludes subjects from resolving bugs in our study and may cause serious faults in real world scenarios. This problem is particularly severe in polymorphic situations. The thesis of this dissertation is that by overlaying visual cues on particular function calls in the source code, we can make developers aware of the presence of directives in th...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDriving a power {{wheelchair}} is {{a difficult}} and complex visual-cognitive task. As a result, some people with visual and/or cognitive disabilities cannot access {{the benefits of a}} power wheelchair because their impairments prevent them from driving safely. In order to improve their access to mobility, we have previously designed a semi-autonomous assistive wheelchair system which progressively corrects the trajectory as the user manually drives the wheelchair and smoothly avoids obstacles. Developing and testing such systems for wheelchair driving assistance requires a significant amount of material resources and clinician time. With Virtual Reality technology, prototypes can be developed and tested in a risk-free and highly flexible Virtual Environment before equipping and testing a physical prototype. Additionally, users can " virtually " test and train more easily during the development process. In this paper, we introduce a power wheelchair driving simulator allowing the user to navigate with a standard wheelchair in an immersive 3 D Virtual Environment. The simulation framework is designed to be flexible so that we can use different control inputs. In order to validate the framework, we first performed tests on the simulator with able-bodied participants during which the user's Quality of Experience (QoE) was assessed through a set of questionnaires. Results show that the simulator is a promising tool for future works as it generates a good sense of presence and requires rather low cognitive <b>effort</b> <b>from</b> <b>users...</b>|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Retrieving {{sufficient}} {{relevant information}} online {{is difficult for}} many people because they use too few keywords to search and search engines do not provide many support tools. To further complicate the search, users often ignore support tools when available. Our goal is to evaluate in a realistic setting when users use support tools and how they perceive these tools. METHODS: We compared three medical search engines with support tools that require more or less <b>effort</b> <b>from</b> <b>users</b> to form a query and evaluate results. We carried out an end user study with 23 users who were asked to find information, i. e., subtopics and supporting abstracts, for a given theme. We used a balanced within-subjects design and report on the effectiveness, efficiency and usability of the support tools from the end user perspective. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant differences in efficiency but did not find significant differences in effectiveness between the three search engines. Dynamic user support tools requiring less effort led to higher efficiency. Fewer searches were needed and more documents were found per search when both query reformulation and result review tools dynamically adjust to the user query. The query reformulation tool that provided {{a long list of}} keywords, dynamically adjusted to the user query, was used most often and led to more subtopics. As hypothesized, the dynamic result review tools were used more often and led to more subtopics than static ones. These results were corroborated by the usability questionnaires, which showed that support tools that dynamically optimize output were preferred...|$|E
40|$|Business Intelligence (BI) {{applications}} {{allow their}} users to query, understand, and analyze existing data within their organizations {{in order to}} acquire useful knowledge, thus making better strategic decisions. The core of BI applications is a Data Warehouse (DW), which integrates several heterogeneous structured data sources in a common repository of data. However, {{there is a common}} agreement in that the next generation of BI applications should consider data not only from their internal data sources, but also data from different external sources (e. g. Big Data, blogs, social networks, etc.), where relevant update information from competitors may provide crucial information in order to take the right decisions. This external data is usually obtained through traditional Web search engines, with a significant <b>effort</b> <b>from</b> <b>users</b> in analyzing the returned information and in incorporating this information into the BI application. In this paper, we propose to integrate the DW internal structured data, with the external unstructured data obtained with Question Answering (QA) techniques. The integration is achieved seamlessly through the presentation of the data returned by the DW and the QA systems into dashboards that allow the user to handle both types of data. Moreover, the QA results are stored in a persistent way through a new DW repository in order to facilitate comparison of the obtained results with different questions or even the same question with different dates.

The Web puts a vast repository of information at users' fingertips, but {{the size and}} complexity of this information space can easily overwhelm users. Recommender systems and tagging systems represent two very different approaches to addressing this information overload. Recommender systems use machine learning and statistical models to automatically retrieve the items of most interest to a particular user. Tagging systems leverage the community's collective knowledge to help users explore the information space themselves. While both approaches can be very effective, they each have limitations. Recommender systems require little <b>effort</b> <b>from</b> <b>users,</b> but they leave users with little control over the recommendation process. Tagging systems put control {{in the hands of}} the user, but [...] because tags are applied by humans [...] tagging systems often suffer from issues of tag sparsity. This thesis explores intelligent tagging systems that combine the machine intelligence of recommender systems with the user control and comprehensibility of tagging systems. We first present Tagsplanations, tag-based explanations that help users understand why an item was recommended to them. We then introduce the Tag Genome, a novel data structure that uses machine learning to augment human judgments of the relationships between tags and items. Next we discuss Movie Tuner, a conversational recommender system based on the Tag Genome that enables users to provide multifaceted feedback using tags. For each system, we outline the design space of the problem and discuss our design decisions. We evaluate each system using both offline analyses as well as field studies involving thousands of users from MovieLens, a movie recommender system that also supports tagging of movies. Finally, we draw conclusions for the broader space of related applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of software across all aspects of people's life means that software failure can bring catastrophic result. It is therefore highly desirable {{to be able to}} develop software that is verified to meet its expected specification. This has also been identified as a key objective in one of the UK Grand Challenges (GC 6) (Jones et al., 2006; Woodcock, 2006). However, many difficult problems still remain in achieving this objective, partially due to the wide use of (recursive) shared mutable data structures which are hard to keep track of statically in a precise and concise way. This thesis aims at building a verification system for both memory safety and functional correctness of programs manipulating pointer-based data structures, which can deal with two scenarios where only partial information about the program is available. For instance the verifier may be supplied with only partial program specification, or with full specification but only part of the program code. For the first scenario, previous state-of-the-art works (Nguyen et al., 2007; Chin et al., 2007; Nguyen and Chin, 2008; Chin et al, 2010) generally require users to provide full specifications for each method of the program to be verified. Their approach seeks much intellectual <b>effort</b> <b>from</b> <b>users,</b> and meanwhile users are liable to make mistakes in writing such specifications. This thesis proposes a new approach to program verification that allows users to provide only partial specification to methods. Our approach will then refine the given annotation into a more complete specification by discovering missing constraints. The discovered constraints may involve both numerical and multiset properties that could be later confirmed or revised by users. Meanwhile, we further augment our approach by requiring only partial specification to be given for primary methods of a program. Specifications for loops and auxiliary methods can then be systematically discovered by our augmented mechanism, with the help of information propagated from the primary methods. This work is aimed at verifying beyond shape properties, with the eventual goal of analysing both memory safety and functional properties for pointer-based data structures. Initial experiments have confirmed that we can automatically refine partial specifications with non-trivial constraints, thus making it easier for users to handle specifications with richer properties. For the second scenario, many programs contain invocations to unknown components and hence only part of the program code is available to the verifier. As previous works generally require the whole of program code be present, we target at the verification of memory safety and functional correctness of programs manipulating pointer-based data structures, where the program code is only partially available due to invocations to unknown components. Provided with a Hoare-style specification ({Pre} prog {Post}) where program (prog) contains calls to some unknown procedure (unknown), we infer a specification (mspecu) for the unknown part (unknown) from the calling contexts, such that the problem of verifying program (prog) can be safely reduced to the problem of proving that the unknown procedure (unknown) (once its code is available) meets the derived specification (mspecu). The expected specification (mspecu) is automatically calculated using an abduction-based shape analysis specifically designed for a combined abstract domain. We have implemented a system to validate the viability of our approach, with encouraging experimental results. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

These devices, e. g., smartphones and internet connected handheld devices, enable quick and efficient access of users to both business and personal data, but also allow the same data to be easily accessed by an intruder if the device is lost or stolen. Existing mobile security solutions attempt to solve this problem by forcing a user to authenticate to a device before being granted access to any data.
