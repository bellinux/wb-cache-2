The prototype U-2, Article 341, never received a USAF serial. The first flight occurred at Groom Lake on 1 August 1955, during what {{was intended to be}} only a high-speed taxi test. The sailplane-like wings were so efficient that the aircraft jumped into the air at , amazing LeVier who, as he later said, [...] "had no intentions whatsoever of flying". The lake bed had no markings making it difficult for LeVier to judge the <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and the brakes proved too weak; he bounced the U-2 once before it stopped rolling. Although the aircraft suffered only minor damage, LeVier again found landing the U-2 difficult during the actual first test flight three days later. On his sixth try, he found that landing the aircraft by touching down on the rear wheel first was superior to the front. Pilots continued to have difficulty during landing, due to the ground effect holding the aircraft off the runway for long distances. On a test flight on 8 August, the U-2 reached , proving that Johnson had met his promised specifications and deadline. By 16 August, the prototype flew at , an altitude never before reached in sustained flight; by 8 September, it reached [...]|$|E

Even so, however, the shock had been tremendous, and as we looked out he was lying panting heavily upon the top of the bags. Hearing our cry, however, he looked up, shook his fist defiantly, and, rolling from the cart, he sprang on to the back of Savary's black horse, and galloped off across the downs, his great beard flying in the wind, untouched by the pistol bullets with which we tried to bring him down.|$|E

It seemed an alarming <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> when they looked down, and the curious swaying motion, with the insecurity of the saddle, made them sick and frightened. But their bodily discomfort was forgotten in the turmoil of bitter thoughts within. What a chasm gaped between their old life and their new! And yet how short was the time and space which divided them! Less than an hour ago they had stood upon the summit of that rock and had laughed and chattered, or grumbled at the heat and flies, becoming peevish at small discomforts. Headingly had been hypercritical over the tints of Nature. They could not forget his own tint as he lay with his cheek upon the black stone. Sadie had chattered about tailor-made dresses and Parisian chiffons. Now she was clinging, half-crazy, to the pommel of a wooden saddle, with suicide rising as a red star of hope in her mind. Humanity, reason, argument,--all were gone, and there remained the brutal humiliation of force. And all the time, down there by the second rocky point, their steamer was waiting for them,--their saloon, with the white napery and the glittering glasses, the latest novel, and the London papers. The least imaginative of them could see it so clearly: the white awning, Mrs. Shlesinger with her yellow sun-hat, Mrs. Belmont lying back in the canvas chair. There it lay almost in sight of them, that little floating chip broken off from home, and every silent, ungainly step of the camels was carrying them more hopelessly away from it. That very morning how beneficent Providence had appeared, how pleasant was life!--a little commonplace, perhaps, but so soothing and restful, And now! ...|$|E

50|$|Running {{backwards}} {{down a hill}} is more dangerous, and it is {{advised that}} someone learn how to drop into a backward roll before attempting it, to deal with any resulting tripping or loss of balance in the prone movement.

50|$|An {{anabatic}} wind, {{from the}} Greek , verbal of anabainein meaning moving upward, is a warm wind which blows {{up a steep}} slope or mountain side, driven by heating of the slope through insolation.

A hill or mountain top will be radiatively warmed by the Sun which in turn heats the air just above it. Air at a similar altitude over an adjacent valley or plain does not get warmed so much because of the greater <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> below it. The effect may be enhanced if the lower lying ground is shaded by the mountain and so receives less heat.|$|E

50|$|The ArcaBoard is {{equipped}} with onboard sensors that maintain it 30 cm above ground and limit its speed to 20 km/h.

The stabilization system can be turned off and the hoverboard can be controlled by using one's center of gravity and body movements. The demonstration videos showed by ARCA were made with the stabilization system turned off.

50|$|SAR {{makes use}} of the {{amplitude}} and the absolute phase of the return signal data. In contrast, interferometry uses differential phase of the reflected radiation, either from multiple passes along the same trajectory and/or from multiple displaced phase centers (antennas) on a single pass. Since the outgoing wave is produced by the satellite, the phase is known, and {{can be compared to}} the phase of the return signal. The phase of the return wave depends on the <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> since the path length to the ground and back will consist of a number of whole wavelengths plus some fraction of a wavelength. This is observable as a phase difference or phase shift in the returning wave. The total distance to the satellite (i.e., the number of whole wavelengths) is known based on the time that it takes for the energy to make the round trip back to the satellite—but it is the extra fraction of a wavelength that is of particular interest and is measured to great accuracy.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new method of solution for incompressible flow analysis past airfoils {{in the presence}} of <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>The</b> present method uses velocity singularities <b>to</b> derive <b>the</b> pressure distribution and the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on <b>the</b> airfoils subjected <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> effect. <b>The</b> method of velocity singularities has been originally developed by Mateescu for the analysis of the steady flow past airfoils and wings in supersonic regime, making use of special singularities associated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> leading edge and ridges, which are characterized by sudden changes in the boundary conditions. In this approach, the presence of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> is modeled by considering a mirror-image airfoil, which is analyzed in conjunction with the real airfoil using velocity singularities, leading to a correct mathematical formulation of the physical problem. The solutions obtained are of aeronautical interest in flight evolutions such as take-off and landing, when the airplane wings are subjected <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> effects. <b>The</b> present solutions have been successfully validated by comparison with previous results obtained by the lumped-vortex method, and by other methods based on matched asymptotic expansions or on conformal transformations.

40|$|Ardeola 60 (2) : 291 - 304. 2013 Disturbance and {{predation}} {{risks from}} terrestrial animals decline the higher up the nest sites selected by birds that nest in wall cavities are located. Terrestrial predators can also negate the protective quality of higher nesting sites by approaching from above in walls. It is unknown how terrestrial predation risks from below and above walls determine nest site selection in cavity-nesting species. In relation to this situation, we describe nest-site selection in common swifts Apus apus {{in the medieval}} city walls of Ávila, Spain. We recorded the entry size, hole depth and the horizontal and vertical positions of cavities. Most cavities were empty despite their size being suitable for nesting. Swifts nested in cavities at least 12 cm deep and with an entry between 3. 5 cm and 13 cm wide. Nests were 3. 5 m above <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and 1. 7 m below {{the top of the}} wall, although there were suitable cavities at the lower and higher extremes, respectively.

Chem. Phys. (2008), 128, 044118. that are known to exhibit problematic charge transfer states. The degree of spatial overlap between occupied and virtual orbitals indicates where TD-DFTB and lc-TD-DFTB can be expected to produce large errors. Secondly, we improve the calculation of oscillator strengths. The transition dipoles are obtained from Slater Koster files for the dipole matrix elements between valence orbitals. In particular excitations localized on a single atom, which appear dark when using Mulliken transition charges, in this way acquire a more realistic oscillator strength.
