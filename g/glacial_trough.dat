During glaciation, these valleys are often widened, deepened and smoothed {{to form a}} [...] "U"-shaped glacial valley or <b>glacial</b> <b>trough,</b> as it is sometimes called. [...] The erosion that creates glacial valleys truncates any spurs of rock or earth that may have earlier extended across the valley, creating broadly triangular-shaped cliffs called truncated spurs. [...] Within glacial valleys, depressions created by plucking and abrasion can be filled by lakes, called paternoster lakes.

2500|$|The {{collapse}} of Larsen B has revealed a thriving chemotrophic ecosystem 800m (half a mile) below the sea. The discovery was accidental. U.S. Antarctic Program scientists {{were in the}} north-western Weddell Sea investigating the sediment record in a deep <b>glacial</b> <b>trough</b> of roughly [...] (twice the size of Texas or France). Methane and hydrogen sulfide associated with cold seeps is suspected {{as the source of}} the chemical energy powering the ecosystem. The area had been protected by the overlying ice sheet from debris and sediment which was seen to be building up on the white microbial mats after the breakup of the ice sheet. Clams were observed clustered about the vents.|$|E

50|$|The Guayaneco Archipelago (Archipiélago Guayaneco) is an {{archipelago}} {{in southern}} Chile. It was heavily glaciated {{during the most}} recent ice age. These glaciers dissected these mountain islands {{into a series of}} deep river valleys and <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs.</b> Today these <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs</b> are deep channels and fjords. The islands of the Guayaneco Archipelago comprise a series of elongated islands and deep bays that are the traces of a drowned coastal range. A number of deep channels are traversing generally north to south through the islands. These include the Messier Channel in the lower left portion of the image, and the Fallos Channel {{near the center of the}} image. Forests cover the lower slopes of the mountains throughout the many islands. Human settlement on these islands is scarce.|$|R
50|$|An underfit stream {{can result}} when {{glaciation}} modifies the landscape by creating <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs.</b> The rivers that occupy such valleys after the ice has retreated {{are not in}} proportion {{with the size of}} the valley. Given the scale of most <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs</b> almost all of them contain misfit streams. Misfit streams can also be caused by reductions in the discharge of the stream. Channel size responds rapidly to variations in discharge, but valley size responds over much longer timescales. Many causes of reduced discharges are possible. If misfit streams are widespread in an area, climate change, particularly a reduction in precipitation, {{is likely to be the}} cause. If a single river appears to be a misfit stream, it may be as a result of anthropogenic interference through groundwater extraction or dam construction upstream. Natural causes include stream capture or other changes in drainage patterns. For instance, New Zealand's largest river (the Waikato) used to flow through the Hauraki Plains to the North Island's east coast, but changed its course to exit on the west coast due to a large volcanic eruption, leaving its former course through the 1-km wide Hinuera Gap occupied by only a small stream.|$|R
50|$|U-shaped valleys, <b>trough</b> valleys or <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs,</b> {{are formed}} {{by the process of}} glaciation. They are {{characteristic}} of mountain glaciation in particular. They have a characteristic U shape, with steep, straight sides and a flat bottom. Glaciated valleys are formed when a glacier travels across and down a slope, carving the valley by the action of scouring. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice, called glacial till or glacial erratic.|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the park}} is over 600 metres above sea level, with altitudes ranging from 160 m at the Picton River to 1,255 m at Hartz Peak. The {{backbone}} of rock in the park is dolerite, while the southern areas at lower altitudes are constituted from sedimentary rocks formed from sediments deposited by marine, glacial and freshwater sources between 355 and 180 million years ago. The relief has been modified over time by several ice ages, forming cirques, horn peaks, aretes and <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Deep ocean {{currents}} carry fine sediments that are {{captured by the}} scaffolding of sponge reefs. A sediment matrix of silt, clay, and some sand forms {{around the base of}} the sponge bioherms. The sediment matrix is soft near the surface, and firm below one metre deep. Dead sponges become covered in sediment, but do not lose their supportive siliceous skeleton. The sponge sediments have high levels of silica and organic carbon. The reefs grow parallel to the <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs,</b> and the morphology of reefs is due to deep currents.|$|R
50|$|Glaciers pick up {{rocks and}} {{sediment}} {{with them as}} they flow. This causes erosion {{and the formation of}} valleys over time. The Inn valley {{is an example of a}} valley carved by glaciers during the ice ages with a typical terraced structure caused by erosion. Eroded rocks from the most recent ice age lie at the bottom of the valley while the top of the valley consists of erosion from earlier ice ages. Glacial valleys have characteristically steep walls (reliefs); valleys with lower reliefs and talus slopes are remnants of <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs</b> or previously infilled valleys. Moraines, piles of rock picked up during the movement of the glacier, accumulate at edges, centre and the terminus of glaciers.|$|R

40|$|Under coastal {{fast ice}} in the Ongul Strait near Syowa Station, Antarctica, warmer, more saline, and oxygen-poorer water appears in mid-depth and deep layers from winter to spring every year. This water is {{explained}} {{as a result of}} mixing between Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) and Winter Water (WW). This water becomes more like CDW and more homogenized with time from winter to spring, and in December a mixing ratio of 1 : 3 - 1 : 4 for CDW to WW is required to explain the properties of the homogenized water. It is inferred that the CDW comes along the <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs.</b> Transport of CDW results in a significant amount of heat supply into the water under fast ice...|$|R
5000|$|Pichu Pichu is an extinct volcano. It {{was active}} 6.7 million years ago, given {{the results of}} potassium-argon dating. Its arcuate shape {{is the result of}} a large sector {{collapse}} one million years ago, which formed the [...] "Arequipa volcanic landslide". Pichu Pichu was glaciated in the past, and this glaciation has left recognizable traces on the mountains including cirques, <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs,</b> hanging valleys and moraines. These moraines occur at elevations of 4500 m and outwash plains are located beneath them. The removal of the western flank of the volcano was also originally considered to be the result of glacial erosion. A series of hills at the base of Pichu Pichu may be erosion products of moraines or moraines proper associated with the volcano.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters describing seismic stratigraphic studies in three very different continental margin settings. The first chapter discusses the northwestern Ross Sea, the second discusses the southeastern Weddell Sea and the third discusses the Alabama/west Florida margin. The purpose was to investigate stratigraphic relationships between deposition during glacial periods (i. e., eustatic lowstands) and interglacial periods (i. e., eustatic highstands) on high-latitude and low-latitude margins. The high-latitude Antarctic margin {{is of particular interest}} because it is over-deepened and surrounds a continent that is free of melt-water. Because of these factors, the shelf/shelf-edge were not subaerially exposed and fluvially incised during eustatic lowstands. Seismic-stratigraphic analysis of the southeastern Weddell and northwestern Ross Sea margins shows that sediments were sequestered in pre-existing <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs</b> or upper-slope fans, at the mouth of <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs.</b> Locations of trough fans and trough mouth fans were strongly controlled by the location of ice streams. This point-source component of stratal architecture contrasts with the implicit line-source assumption that dominates recent thinking of Antarctic stratal development. Point-sourced trough mouth fans are relatively stable features, but as evidenced in Weddell Sea, they have experienced intermittent large-volume collapse. Upper-slope collapse is predicted to have been related to a dramatic change in over-burden, initiated early in an interglacial period following a long-duration glacial period. Interglacial shedding contrasts with models of low/middle-latitude sedimentation, which suggest that the basin is sediment starved during the interglacial. Seismic stratigraphic analysis of the Alabama/west Florida low-subsidence, middle-latitude continental margin indicates that upper-slope shelf-margin deltas have remained intact throughout the glacial cycle, in spite of widespread subaerial exposure. It is concluded that Pleistocene (?) relative-sea-level fall was insufficiently rapid to initiate major bypass of the upper slope. Therefore, other factors (antecedent topography, salt tectonics and growth faulting) are deemed to be more important initiators of upper-slope canyon formation on the middle-latitude margin...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} {{relative}} sea-level rise {{along the northern}} Gulf of Mexico must be constrained {{in order to determine}} the relative effects of eustatic sea-level rise, subsidence, antecedent topography, and sediment supply variations on fluvial [...] bay-shoreline sedimentary systems. This study adds important additional sea-level indicators for the past 10 kyrs in addition to compiling the extensive pre-existing data from the literature. The northern Gulf of Mexico data from the modern shoreline is compared western and eastern Gulf of Mexico datasets to determine the relative difference in subsidence rates over the past 4 kyrs. Subsidence differences are negligible. Furthermore, quantification of the antecedent topography provides a means to account for its effects on sedimentary architecture and the evolution of the Sabine and Calcasieu river-bay systems. The record of eustasy potentially indicates 3 to 4 meter-scale rapid rise intervals during the early Holocene. Subsequent to 7. 5 ka, the progradation and retrogradation of the sedimentary systems must be attributed to sediment supply variations (climate change). From 7. 5 ka to ∼ 3 ka, the east Texas, west Louisiana climate oscillated between sub-humid to sub-arid to produce greater than modern sediment flux manifested as deltaic deposits in the modern estuaries. Important future applications of this study include comparison to the nature and timing of fluvial-deltaic retreat in other estuaries along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts. The South Shetland Islands, off the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula, are separated by <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs</b> carved during <b>glacial</b> maxima. These <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs</b> are currently fjords which contain a glaciomarine sedimentary record. Age constraining the sediments provides a retreat history of the ice cap for the past 15 kyrs including rates and magnitude of retreat for sub-polar glacial systems. Furthermore, the timing of the migration of sub-glacial polar (cold-based) glacial conditions southward is constrained to ∼ 10 kyr. This has important implications for Holocene glacial flow rates and ice shelf stability in the Antarctic Peninsula region...|$|R
40|$|We here {{present a}} {{detailed}} glacial geomorphological map covering 136, 500 km 2 of the Bayan Har {{sector of the}} northeastern Tibetan Plateau - an area previously suggested to have nourished the most extensive Quaternary glaciers of the Tibetan Plateau. The map, presented at a scale of 1 : 650, 000, is based on remote sensing of a 90 m SRTM digital elevation model and 15 / 30 m Landsat ETM+ satellite imagery. Seven landform types have been mapped; <b>glacial</b> valleys, <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs,</b> <b>glacial</b> lineations,marginal moraines, marginal moraine remnants, meltwater channels and hummocky terrain. A large number of glacial landforms exist, concentrated around mountain blocks protruding above the surrounding plateau area, testifying to former glacial activity. In contrast, large plateau areas of lower altitude lack glacial landforms. The mapped glacial geomorphology indicates multiple former glacial advances primarily by valley and piedmont glaciers, but lends no support to the hypothesis of ice sheet scale glaciation in the area. The presented glacial geomorphological map demonstrates the usefulness of remote sensing techniques for mapping the glacial geomorphology of the Tibetan Plateau, {{and it will be}} used for reconstructing the paleoglaciology of the Bayan Har sector of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau.

40|$|Abstract：The {{timing and}} extent of glaciations during the Late Quaternary in the South Shetland Islands, West Antarctica were defined using field mapping, geomorphic {{analysis}} and radiocarbon dating. Landforms of glacial erosion and deposition, in particular subglacial meltwater channel erosion, suggest that at least three glaciations occurred during the late Quaternary within the study region. During the global LGM, <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs</b> (such as Maxwell Bay and Admiralty Bay) were overdeepened by an ice stream moving south from an~ 1000 m-thick ice cap centered on the present-day continental shelf to the north. This ice {{was responsible for the}} subglacial meltwater channel erosion, and glacial polished and striated bedrock on the Fildes Peninsula. The recent local glaciations occurred about 2, 000 years ago and during Little Ice Age (LIA).

50|$|Traffic Circle is a glacier-filled expanse 500 m high, {{situated}} {{south of}} Mount Ptolemy and medially on Antarctic Peninsula between Marguerite Bay and Mobiloil Inlet. Hub Nunatak {{rises from the}} center of the Traffic Circle. From this position, five <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs</b> radiate like the spokes of a wheel. One connects on the north with Gibbs Glacier and Neny Glacier, leading to Neny Fjord. Another connects on the west with Lammers Glacier and Windy Valley, leading to Mikkelsen Bay.

The fourth, Weyerhaeuser Glacier, trends southward toward Wakefield Highland and connects with glaciers leading westward to Wordie Ice Shelf. The fifth, Mercator Ice Piedmont, is nourished by the outflow from Weyerhaeuser, Cole and Gibbs Glaciers; it broadens as it descends eastward to the head of Mobiloil Inlet. Discovered in 1940 by members of the East Base party of the United States Antarctic Service (USAS), 1939-41, who used this system of troughs in traveling across the upland, hence the name Traffic Circle.|$|R
2500|$|It is a valley-type glacier, {{situated}} in the Uttarkashi district of Garhwal Himalaya, Uttarakhand(Figure 1) and it flows to NW direction. This glacier is bound between 30°43'22"–30°55'49" [...] (lat.) and 79°4'41"–79°16'34" [...] (long.), extending in height from 4120 to 7000 m.a.s.l. This area is situated north of the Main Central Thrust (MCT) and {{is made up of}} bedrocks of granites, garnet mica schist, quartz biotite schist, kyanite schist, augen gneiss and banded augen gneiss. The glacier is composed of a variety of depositional features such as talus cones, snow-avalanche fans, snow-bridges, and dead ice mounds, and erosional features like pyramidal and conical peaks, serrated ridge crests, <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs,</b> smooth rock walls, crags and tails, waterfalls, rock basins, gullies and glacial lakes. All along the Gangotri glacier, several longitudinal and transverse crevasses are formed along which ice blocks have broken down. The ablation zone of the Gangotri glacier is covered by a thick pile of supraglacial moraines and is characterized by several ice sections, melting into pools of supraglacial lakes. Because of subsidence and the fast degenerating nature of the glacier, its centre is full of supraglacial lakes. In this part of higher Himalaya, glacial melt-water dominates the fluvial system.|$|R

These bedforms have styles, depths and orientations similar to features discovered earlier on the Chukchi Borderland, up to 800 km northwest of the ABM. Lineations occur {{across the surface of}} a flattened bathymetric bench interpreted to have formed by an ice shelf sliding along the continental slope and scraping the seafloor at temporary grounding locations. The glacial geology of surrounding areas suggests that an ice shelf probably flowed from the mouths of overdeepened <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs</b> in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago westward along the ABM and across the Chukchi Borderland. This curved pathway indicates an obstruction to ice flow in the central Canada Basin, possibly caused by either a basin-wide ice shelf or by a pile-up of mega-bergs originating from the Eurasian side of the Arctic Ocean.

Rounded mountain tops occur {{below the}} highest erosional trimlines on the flanks of <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs</b> draining the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) and in intervening reliefs. Complex older drifts rest on deglaciated areas above the younger late Pleistocene glacial drift. The authors use geomorphological and glacial geological surveys and surface exposure dating to reconstruct a local chronology of pre-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) {{variations of the}} EAIS and related outlet glaciers. Glacially transported erratics, as well as bedrock surfaces were sampled for cosmogenic-nuclide analysis (10 Be and 21 Ne). Bedrock samples show consistent 10 Be and 21 Ne exposure ages indicating exposure since at least 4 Ma with an erosion rate of about 17 cm/Ma; contrary to this, exposure ages of the older drift(s) range from 87 ka to 1352 ka. Furthermore, differences between 21 Ne and 10 Be exposure ages of the erratics indicate complex exposure histories with substantial periods of burial by cold-based ice. Rounded mountain tops represent relict landscape features eroded by the EAIS and its related inter-connected glacier system which overrode the whole coastal area; afterwards, the coastal piedmonts were repeatedly exposed and buried by ice from local and outlet glaciers which did not modify the pre- existing landscape...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{subglacial}} bed conditions {{through multiple}} glaciations and {{their effect on}} ice dynamics are addressed through an analysis of glacigenic sequences in the Upper Pleistocene stratigraphy of the southern North Sea basin. During Elsterian (MIS 12) ice growth, till deposition was subdued when ice became stagnant over a permeable substrate of fluvial sediments, and meltwater infiltrated into the bed. Headward erosion during glacial retreat produced a dense network of glacial valleys up to several hundreds of metres deep. A Saalian (MIS 6) glacial advance phase resulted in the deposition of a sheet of stiff sandy tills and terminal moraines. Meltwater was at least partially evacuated through the till layer, resulting {{in the development of}} a rigid bed. During the later part of the Saalian glaciation, ice-stream inception can be related to the development of a glacial lake to the north and west of the study area. The presence of meltwater channels incised into the floors of <b>glacial</b> <b>troughs</b> is indicative of high subglacial water pressures, which may have played a role in the onset of ice streaming. We speculate that streaming ice flow in the later part of the Saalian glaciation caused the relatively early deglaciation, as recorded in the Amsterdam Terminal borehole. These results suggest that changing subglacial bed conditions through glacial cycles could have a strong impact on ice dynamics and require consideration in ice-sheet reconstructions...|$|R
