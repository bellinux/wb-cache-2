Bias-cut garments were an important feature of the designs of Madeleine Vionnet in 1920s and 1930s and bias-cut styles are revived periodically.

50|$|Sarongs known under {{a variety}} of local names are {{traditionally}} worn by the people of Yemen and elsewhere on the Arabian Peninsula. Local names <b>for</b> the <b>garment</b> include fūṭah, izaar, wizār and maʿwaz (pl. maʿāwiz). In Hadhramawt sarong is called ṣārūn in the interior and ṣārūm in the coastal region. In Oman, sarongs are called wizār and are often white in color, similar to the Keralan mundu of South Asia and it is usually worn under the Thawb. In Saudi Arabia, sarongs are known as izaar. Designs can be checkered or striped as well floral or arabesque, but double plaid (i.e., a vertical section of the izār with a different plaid pattern) designs from Indonesia are also very popular. In southwestern Saudi Arabia, tribal groups have their own style of unstitched izaar, which is locally woven. This is also worn in northern Yemen. However, the tribal groups in Yemen each have their own design for their fūṭah, the latter of which may include tassels and fringes. It is thought that these tribal futah resemble the original izaar as worn on the Arabian Peninsula since pre-Islamic times such as the Shendyt. They are generally worn open and unstitched {{in such a way that}} the garment does not reach over one's ankles. Other izaars, often imported from Bangladesh, are the traditional clothing of Arab fishermen of the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. It was the traditional <b>garment</b> <b>for</b> <b>men</b> before the introduction of pant-like pyjamas and kaftans during the Turkish and European colonial periods. Tube-stitched as well as open sarongs are both worn, even in formal dishdasha-wearing countries, as casual sleep wear and at home.|$|R

40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis is}} a case study that explores the {{possibilities}} and complications to use social media in marketing purposes. The case involves a company that sells <b>garments</b> <b>for</b> <b>men.</b> The company, named Mouli, has decided to use social media as their marketing platform. The company makes an interesting case, since they are still quite new {{on the market and}} have all the possibilities to succeed. The purpose for the thesis is to examine Mouli’s use of marketing in social media and to evaluate what could be done to amend the communication. The purpose is also to discuss and reflect certain effects that the company is exposed to when using these media channels. These questions has been subject throughout the thesis: Description of Mouli’s communication, what is said and how is it presented? How well is Mouli’s brand with its core values presented in their communication? What kind of expectations is there and what significance does the communication in the social media have for the company? The thesis is based on theories from marketing communication, such as the concepts brand, core values, superior value, brand image, brand identity and storytelling. These theories have been applied to the theories about communication on the web and social media. This case study was accomplished with qualitative analysis and interviews. The method being used was Kozinets´ nethnography, together with Roman Jakobson’s communication model and picture analysis based on Barthes theories. The results showed that Mouli’s communication functioned and it was well connected to the brand with its core values. The setback is that Mouli does not use the social media channels to their full potential and therefore there are measures that have to be executed...|$|E
60|$|Penelope also wove a [Greek: charos] {{against the}} burial of old Laertes, but surely {{she ought to}} have woven for him; on Helbig's showing Hector had two, Patroclus had only one; Patroclus is in the old epic, Hector and Laertes are in the Ionian epics; therefore, Laertes should have had two [Greek: charea] but we only hear of one.

She thought of no funeral <b>garments</b> <b>for</b> the old <b>man</b> but one shroud [Greek: speiron] (Odyssey, II. 102; XIX. 147); yet, being, by the theory, a character of late Ionian, not of genuine old AEolic epic, she should have known better. It is manifest that if even the acuteness and vast erudition of Helbig can only find such invisible differences as these between the manners of the genuine old epic and the late Ionian innovations, there is really no difference, beyond such trifles as diversify custom in any age.|$|R
