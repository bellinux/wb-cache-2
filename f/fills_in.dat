5|$|Silent Hill: Shattered Memories divides its {{gameplay}} {{between two}} different settings. The first section {{is set in}} a psychotherapist's office and the second in a town called Silent Hill. In the first section, the player interacts with Dr. Michael Kaufmann, a therapist who is a non-player character, from a first-person perspective. The player responds to Kaufmann's questions and completes a psychological test, <b>fills</b> <b>in</b> a questionnaire or colors pictures. The player's responses to these tests alters aspects of gameplay in the second setting, including the available areas, the physical appearance and behavior of characters encountered, and the physical appearance of the monsters. Shattered Memories returns to Kaufmann's office periodically throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|Combined {{with the}} poached elements, both new {{specimens}} represent {{almost the entire}} skeleton of Deinocheirus, as MPC-D 100/127 includes all material apart from the middle dorsal vertebrae, most caudal vertebrae, and the right forelimb; MPC-D 100/128 <b>fills</b> <b>in</b> most gaps of the other skeleton, with nearly all dorsal and caudal vertebrae, the ilium, a partial ischium, {{and most of the}} left hindlimb. In 2014, the specimens were described in the Nature journal by Lee, Barsbold, Currie, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, Hang-Jae Lee Lee, Godefroit, Escuillié, and Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig. A similar series of events was reported earlier in 2014 with Spinosaurus, another sail-backed theropod which had only been known from few remains since 1912. Poached remains were reunited with specimens obtained by scientists, and Spinosaurus was shown to have been quite different from other spinosaurids. The two cases showed that the lifestyle and appearance of incompletely known extinct animals cannot always be safely inferred from close relatives.|$|E

5|$|The first biographical {{sketch of}} Friedrich Accum's life {{was written by}} the American {{agricultural}} chemist and historian of science Charles Albert Browne, Jr. in 1925. He studied the life and works of Accum closely for ten years, which {{he was able to}} complement with information from civil and ecclesiastical sources in Bückeburg. His enthusiasm for the subject was so great that he traveled to Germany in July 1930 to meet with Hugo Otto Georg Hans Westphal (August 26, 1873 – September 15, 1934), a great-grandson of Accum's. Brown's last writing on the subject, which appeared in 1948 in Chymia, a journal for the history of chemistry, relied to a great extent on the information he gathered from Hugo Westphal. Three years later, R. J. Cole published an outline of Accum's life based on English sources. He was particularly concerned with bringing new information to light about the judicial process of 1821. Like Browne, Cole also provided relatively little data about the last part of Accum's life in Berlin. A modern presentation of Accum's life and works that <b>fills</b> <b>in</b> the lacuna in the available biographies has not been written. Lawson Cockroft of the Royal Society of Chemistry in London observed that Friedrich Accum was one of those chemists who, despite significant achievements in his lifetime, was by and large forgotten today.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new method for {{automatically}} <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> gaps of textural sounds. Our {{approach is to}} transform the signal to the time-frequency space, <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> the gap, and apply the inverse transform to reconstruct the result. The complex spectrogram of the signal is partitioned into separate overlapping frequency bands. Each band is fragmented by segmentation of the time-frequency space and a partition of the spectrogram <b>in</b> time, and <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> with complex fragments by example. We demonstrate our method by <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> gaps of various types of textural sounds. 1...|$|R

40|$|The term ‘filling in’ was {{developed}} in the context of research into UK devolution in order to move beyond the literature on the ‘hollowing out’ of the national state. We critically unpack the concept of <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> and assess its value, identifying three main ambiguities. First, we emphasise the need to distinguish between what we term structural and relational forms of <b>filling</b> <b>in,</b> ensuring a clear analytical separation between structure and agency. Second, we examine the associated scalar politics of devolution, arguing that <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> and hollowing out are not scale-specific processes. Third, we distinguish between <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> as originally advanced, which is time-specific in relation to the process of devolution, and ‘pure’ forms of <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> which can be seen as time-neutral. <b>In</b> abstracting <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> from the context of devolution in this way, our purpose is to render it capable of wider application to the study of other processes of state restructuring...|$|R
