40|$|A {{releasable}} {{support device}} is described which {{is comprised of}} a hollow body with a sleeve extending transversely there-through for receiving {{the end of a}} support shank. A slider-latch, optionally lubricated, extends through side recesses in the sleeve to straddle the shank, respectively, in latched and released positions. The slider-latch is slid from its latched to its unlatched position by a pressure squib whereupon a spring or other pressure means pushes the shank out of the sleeve. At the same time, a <b>follower</b> <b>element</b> is lodged in and closed the hole in the body wall from which the shank was discharged. The mechanism was designed for the shuttle orbiter/external tank connection device...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} and vibrations of camshaft excited by multi-follower elements are modeled and analyzed. A pushrod valve train system from a four-cylinder diesel engine is {{selected as the}} case study. The camshaft is modeled to analyze the interactions of multi-follower elements. Both the camshaft angular vibration and bending vibration are taken into consideration. Each <b>follower</b> <b>element</b> is simplified as a multi-mass system. The lumped masses are connected by the spring elements and the damping elements. The contact force model at the cam–tappet interfaces was developed based on the elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication theory of finite line conjunction. From the analysis results, {{it can be seen}} that the bending vibration of camshaft is mainly in the normal direction at the cam–tappet interfaces. Moreover, the bending vibration is mainly influenced by the overlapping of inlet cam function and exhaust cam function of each cylinder. The angular vibration of camshaft mainly focuses at the fundamental frequency and the harmonic frequency corresponding to the cylinder number...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the design for}} a basic current-mode building block for analog signal process-ing, called Current Controlled Current Differencing Buffered Amplifier (CC-CDBA). Its parasitic resis-tances at two current input ports can be controlled by an input bias current. The output current and voltage offset are quite low. The proposed element was realized in a BiCMOS technology and the volt-age <b>follower</b> in the <b>element</b> is modified to achieve high performance properties. Its performances are examined through PSPICE simulations. In addition, examples as a current-mode multiplier/divider and current amplifier are included, compared to the con-ventional CC-CDBA implementation. They disclose performances of the proposed CC-CDBA superior to previous CC-CDBA...|$|R
50|$|Peri's works, however, did {{not arise}} {{out of a}} {{creative}} vacuum {{in the area of}} sung drama. An underlying prerequisite for the creation of opera proper was the practice of monody. Monody is the solo singing/setting of a dramatically conceived melody, designed to express the emotional content of the text it carries, which is accompanied by a relatively simple sequence of chords rather than other polyphonic parts. Italian composers began composing in this style late in the 16th century, and it grew in part from the long-standing practise of performing polyphonic madrigals with one singer accompanied by an instrumental rendition of the other parts, as well as the rising popularity of more popular, more homophonic vocal genres such as the frottola and the villanella. In these latter two genres, the increasing tendency was toward a more homophonic texture, with the top part featuring an elaborate, active melody, and the lower ones (usually these were three-part compositions, as opposed to the four-or-more-part madrigal) a less active supporting structure. From this, it was only a small step to fully-fledged monody. All such works tended to set humanist poetry of a type that attempted to imitate Petrarch and his Trecento <b>followers,</b> another <b>element</b> of the period's tendency toward a desire for restoration of principles it associated with a mixed-up notion of antiquity.|$|R

40|$|Many of the {{prevailing}} approaches to understanding leadership assume that leadership operates as an individual-level phenomenon, inwhich one person takes {{on the role of}} a leader. However, a number of recently developed leadership models now describe leadership as a shared process. These collectivistic theories present leadership as a dynamic process in which a leader may selectively utilize the skills of <b>followers</b> and distribute <b>elements</b> of the leadership role among these followers as the situation demands. In this study, we conduct an investigation into the viability of core elements of the collectivistic theories through a historiometric analysis of events from the career of a notable leader, George C. Marshall. One hundred and two events from Marshall 2 ̆ 7 s career were identified from historical biographies and were then content coded and analyzed with regard to the components of a collectivistic leadership model. The results of this historiometric analysis indicated that there are key antecedents to collectivistic leadership and that the use of this form of leadership can result in positive team outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Jamaat, a {{transnational}} Islamic reform movement, which {{originated in}} India in the 1920 s. The movement claims to reinforce faith by preaching among Muslims. Tablighi Jamaat is now operative in 165 countriess with about 80 million followers around the world. This study {{looks at the}} Tablighi Jamaat in two very different contexts, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom (UK), where the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful. In Bangladesh, the Tablighi Jamaat is a very large-scale movement where several million people attend the annual congregation (Bishwa Ijtema) of the Tablighi Jamaat every year. The UK has a much smaller following of the Tablighi Jamaat than Bangladesh. There are perhaps 50, 000 active Tablighi Jamaat followers in the UK. This ethnographic study shows {{that the success of}} the Tablighi Jamaat results from the positive image, which it cultivates, and the systematic preaching activities of Tablighi Jamaat followers. The organisation’s apolitical image, the public profile of the ijtema, the humbleness in personality and behaviour of Tablighi followers, and the attraction of belonging to the global Tablighi community, all assist to create a positive image of the Tablighi Jamaat among ordinary Muslims. In addition, family and peer pressure, and a variety of personal reasons explain why people join the movement. In the thesis, I also argue that the Tablighi Jamaat remains successful because of its ability to hold its followers (both new and long-term) within a Tablighi-guided life. A Tablighi-guided life is perceived as a protection against the Western lifestyle. <b>Followers</b> define many <b>elements</b> of contemporary Western lifestyle as non-Islamic. By clearly defining what is Islamic and non-Islamic within contemporary society, the Tablighi Jamaat provides a way in which Muslims can live in the contemporary world, but remain good Muslims...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Development of an {{intensity}} setter, {{which in a}} rational law changes the opening thyristor the voltage regulator and effectively to changing power supply voltage stator windings of the electric pump deepening, ensuring a smooth start in a wide range. Methodology. Electric submersible pump belongs to the small inertia electric, since it is not significant total moment of inertia, not exceeding two moments of inertia of the motor and static moment on the shaft does not exceed {{forty percent of the}} nominal torque. For technical requirements that electric acceleration time should have no less than twenty seconds or more. Office starting modes of electric submersible pumps economically justified using thyristor voltage regulator by forming the dial changes the intensity of the necessary legislation in time voltage feeding the stator windings. This ensures a smooth start right rotor of the electric submersible pump. Results. A block diagram of the intensity setter that is: with control unit, two units that form the exponential voltage supply emitter <b>follower</b> and regulatory <b>elements.</b> The mathematical expressions for voltage at the stator windings of the motor, changing exponentially, opening the angle of thyristor power unit thyristor the voltage regulator, which is determined through the initial angle of opening. Provided formula for pick-up voltage and minimum voltage, time constants, which are determined from the basic equations of motion and mechanical characteristics of the electric motor. Analytical investigated by the voltage dependence violation by changing the time constant flowing and growing exhibitor supply voltage stator electric circuit deepening pump. Originality. Proposed in the initial time on the stator windings of the electric pick-up voltage is applied. Under the influence of this voltage, motor rotor begins to accelerate. At the same time, pick-up voltage decreases the minimum startup voltage varies exponentially in which the rotor of the electric motor continues to rotate more steadily. Now the voltage at the motor stator windings increases exponentially to the nominal voltage of the supply network. This start flowing smoothly for the right time to establish nominal rotor speed of the motor. Practical value. Developed dial allows you to increase the intensity of the electric motor acceleration time and reduce the dynamic loads of the electric submersible pump...|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{methods to}} enable the {{evaluation}} of important lubrication operational parameters at the contact between any cam and follower mechanism (excluding valve trains incorporating rolling <b>element</b> <b>followers</b> or hydraulic lash adjusters) have been collated, critically assessed and developed. A robust and user friendly computer program, which incorporated these methods, was written in order that the tribological conditions existing at the cam/follower interface of any type of valve train in common use in today's internal combustion engines could be studied. The output from the program included graphical displays of frictional torque, minimum lubricant film thickness and Hertzian stress around the cam cycle. Such studies were performed on a cam and flat faced follower system, a cam and centrally pivoted follower system, a cam and end pivoted follower system and a desmodromic system (comprising a conventional cam and centrally pivoted. system and a desmodromic cam and end pivoted follower system). The computer program also allowed parametric studies {{to be carried out}} on valve train mechanisms. Parametric studies of three different valve trains, including the valve trains from the Rover 2300 and the Ford 2. 0 litre Pinto engines, have been presented, the results being presented in graphical and tabular form. The loadings, orbits, and power losses associated with the camshaft bearings of the Ford 2. 0 litre Pinto engine were evaluated using existing dynamically loaded bearing analysis techniques. The total frictional power loss predicted for the three camshaft bearings was found to be equal to approximately one fifth of that calculated for all of the cam/follower interfaces throughout the operational speed range of the engine. An experimental single valve desmodromic valve train apparatus was designed and commissioned to test the accuracy of the valve train lubrication analysis computer program. The apparatus allowed studies to be made of the running-in of valve trains operating at lubricant temperatures of 40 C, 60 C and. 80 C, by applying the electrical resistivity technique. Analytical models used to predict which cam/follower pair was in control of the valve at any point around the cam cycle were tested using an electrical continuity technique and were found to show good agreement with practice. Good agreement was also found between the theoretically predicted and measured torque and power required to drive the valve train. ...|$|R
