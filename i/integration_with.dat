5|$|Ukraine {{submitted}} {{an application}} {{to participate in}} the Eurasian Economic Union as an observer in August 2013. Viktor Yanukovych's decision to abandon an association agreement with the European Union and exclusively pursue <b>integration</b> <b>with</b> the EEU was a key factor in the Euromaidan protests that ended his term as president of Ukraine and led to the Crimean Crisis. The country's membership in the EEU was seen by some analysts as the key {{to the success of the}} union as Ukraine has the second largest economy of any of the 15 former republics of the Soviet Union. With high tensions between Russia and Ukraine in the wake of the crisis, Ukraine decided to pursue <b>integration</b> <b>with</b> the EU.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the civil war in 1983, a number of poets and fiction writers became active, {{focusing}} on subjects such as death, destruction, and rape.

5|$|In the Mediterranean, {{a guerrilla}} war waged by Greek Cypriots ended in 1960 {{leading to an}} {{independent}} Cyprus, with the UK retaining the military bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. The Mediterranean islands of Malta and Gozo were amicably granted independence from the UK in 1964 and became the country of Malta, though the idea had been raised in 1955 of <b>integration</b> <b>with</b> Britain.|$|E
5|$|Indonesian {{nationalist}} {{and military}} hardliners, particularly {{leaders of the}} intelligence agency Kopkamtib and special operations unit, Opsus, saw the Portuguese coup {{as an opportunity for}} East Timor's <b>integration</b> <b>with</b> Indonesia. The central government and military feared that an East Timor governed by leftists {{could be used as a}} base for incursions by unfriendly powers into Indonesia, and also that an independent East Timor within the archipelago could inspire secessionist sentiments within Indonesian provinces.|$|E
5|$|<b>Integration</b> <b>with</b> Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Azure {{were added}} in 2014.

40|$|Twelve July <b>integrations</b> {{are made}} <b>with</b> the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres' Global Circulation Model GLAS GCM to {{investigate}} the influence of local changes in the land surface fluxes, that may be produced by changes in the land surface vegetation, on the monsoon circulation and rainfall over the Indian subcontinent. The study consists of an ensemble mean of three integrations each for four separate cases: (1) control <b>integrations</b> <b>with</b> normaly prescribed boundary conditions, called C; (2) three other <b>integrations</b> <b>with</b> the surface albedo increased (from 0. 14 to 0. 20) on the Indian subcontinent, called E sub 1; (3) another set of three <b>integrations</b> <b>with</b> the surface albedo increased as above together with a decrease of surface roughness (from 45 cm to 0. 02 cm), called E sub 2; and (4) a last set of three <b>integrations</b> <b>with</b> higher surface albedo and low surface roughness as above, but with no evapotranspiration, called E sub 3. Except for these changes in the anomaly region (delimited by solid line) all other boundary conditions were prescribed. Consequently, their time evaluation is unaffected by the Earth-atmosphere interactions...|$|R

5|$|After {{visiting his}} ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design {{based on some}} simple but nuanced {{techniques}} he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings. Among these were abundant gardens, <b>integration</b> <b>with</b> nature, and consideration {{of the relationship between}} enclosure and opening. Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery. Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond. Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known were disappointed, but the new hotel found more favour with government officials and architects.|$|E
5|$|Austria and Switzerland {{are both}} {{members of the}} Partnership for Peace, and border NATO member states. Malta {{is also a member}} of the Partnership for Peace and the European Union. However, each country has a long-standing policy of neutrality. Cyprus is the only Member state of the European Union that is not a member of the Partnership for Peace, with any treaty blocked by Turkey's {{concerns}} regarding the Cyprus dispute. According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Enver Hoxhaj, <b>integration</b> <b>with</b> NATO is a priority for Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. Hoxhaj stated in 2014 that the country's goal is to be a NATO member by 2022. However, four NATO member states, Greece, Romania, Spain, and Slovakia, do not recognize Kosovo's independence. United Nations membership, which Kosovo does not have, is considered to be necessary for NATO membership.|$|E
