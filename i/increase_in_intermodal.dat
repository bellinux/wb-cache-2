40|$|Intermodal freight {{transport}} has {{developed into a}} significant sector of the transport industry in its own right. This development has been followed by an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>intermodal</b> {{freight transport}}ation research. We contend that a new transportation research application field is emerging; and that, while still in a pre-paradigmatic phase, {{it is now time}} to move on to a more mature independent research field. An independent research field can be justified because intermodal transport is a complex system that has characteristics which distinguishes it from other transport systems. We have reviewed 92 publications in order to identify the characteristics of the intermodal research community and scientific knowledge base. This paper will discuss aspects of this research, assessing the status quo and seeking directions for the future. To conclude, we will propose an intermodal research agenda which can direct the intermodal research field towards a period of "normal science". ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Intermodal freight {{transport}} has received an increased attention due to problems of road congestion, environmental concerns and traffic safety. A growing {{recognition of the}} strategic importance of speed and agility in the supply chain is forcing firms to reconsider traditional logistic services. As a consequence, research interest <b>in</b> <b>intermodal</b> {{freight transport}}ation problems is growing. This paper {{provides an overview of}} planning decisions <b>in</b> <b>intermodal</b> freight transport and solution methods proposed in scientific literature. Planning problems are classified according to type of decision maker and decision level. General conclusions are given and subjects for further research are identified...|$|R

30|$|The {{intermodal}} transport industry {{is characterized by}} multiple decision makers who need to work in collaboration {{in order for the}} transport system to run smoothly. An overview of the state-of-the-art research on planning problems <b>in</b> <b>intermodal</b> freight transport is presented by Caris et al. [1]. Intermodal transport, is a combination of different transport modes that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other transport modes. Intermodal transport arises as a new transport mode when the chain is fully integrated and {{can be seen as a}} complete door-to-door service. An increased level of coordination is necessary to organize the {{intermodal transport}} flow.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the potential benefits of access management for carrier operations <b>in</b> <b>intermodal</b> freight transportation. Research Approach: The research is conducted in two phases. In the first phase, problems with poor access management <b>in</b> <b>intermodal</b> freight transportation systems are identified. A literature study on extant research together with real-life observations and conversations are synthesized into a problem description as well as an analysis model. In the second phase, the identified problems are studied and the analysis model is applied to generate a list of potential benefits of access management for carrier operations <b>in</b> <b>intermodal</b> freight transportation. Findings and Originality: This paper presents the potential benefits of access management in order to solve some of the problems (i. e. fully congested terminals, crucial interaction between carriers, and lack of high quality real-time data) for carrier operations <b>in</b> <b>intermodal</b> freight transportation. <b>In</b> addition, since a gap in existing research regarding the intersection between haulier, intermodal terminal and access management was identified, a higher level of access management has been defined, called “prioritised access management”. It focuses on prioritised access for certain resources (such as a bus lane or specific time slot window) <b>in</b> order to <b>increase</b> efficiency and sustainability. Research Impact: The main theoretical implications are improved understanding and knowledge of access management, how it is defined, and how it works in different transportation modes. Future research should continue the benchmarking of access management and broaden the inquiry to learn from industries other than transportation. In addition, soliciting important input regarding future requirements and the needs of access management from other stakeholders in the industry will be key to developing the newly defined “prioritised access management” function. Practical Impact: The focus of the contribution is on stakeholders within the disciplines Logistics and Transportation and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). With access management, several potential benefits in carrier operations for intermodal freight transportation are identified...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the rapid}} growth of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and their {{benefits}} for business processes, intermodal freight transport companies still face challenges in ICT adoption including low compatibility, low level of management support and insufficient awareness of the expected advantages. This may prevent companies from thoroughly deploying ICT, although the benefits of being proactive in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) adoption are largely documented. This study investigates the antecedents of ITS adoption <b>in</b> <b>intermodal</b> freight transport companies at both the levels of company and managers. This is important because the uptake of recent ICT advantages <b>in</b> the <b>intermodal</b> freight transport arena seems slow and the evidence on the determinants of such posteriori acceptability of ITS is limited in current applied ITS studies. We present a framework that identifies four broad categories of environmental, organisational, technological and individual characteristics, and show how these categories influence the decision-making process of both companies and managers to adopt ICT <b>in</b> <b>intermodal</b> freight industry. This adoption framework draws on theoretical perspectives in Technologic, Organization and Environmental (TOE) theory and Unified theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UATUA). We further discuss the implications of this research for academicians and practitioners...|$|R
