50|$|<b>Event</b> {{collection}} {{is the process}} of collecting <b>event</b> occurrences in a filtered <b>event</b> log for analysis. A filtered <b>event</b> log is logged <b>event</b> occurrences that can be of meaningful use in the future; this implies that <b>event</b> occurrences can be removed from the filtered <b>event</b> log if they are useless in the future. <b>Event</b> log analysis {{is the process of}} analyzing the filtered <b>event</b> log to aggregate <b>event</b> occurrences or {{to decide whether or not}} an <b>event</b> occurrence should be signalled. <b>Event</b> signalling is the process of signalling <b>event</b> occurrences over the <b>event</b> bus.|$|R
30|$|<b>Event</b> {{reputation}} system (ERS): The <b>event</b> {{reputation system}} (ERS) prevents inaccurate traffic messages in VANETs. A dynamic reputation system {{is used to}} determine the incoming traffic trustworthiness to the driver. In this scheme, the vehicle gets enough reputation from inside sensors and received messages. When enough reputation is received, then the traffic warning will be broadcasting to other vehicles in the network. The scheme is dependent on two parameters: <b>event</b> reputation value and <b>event</b> confidence list. <b>Event</b> reputation system consists of three interfaces and four functionalities. One is <b>event</b> table storage for received messages or <b>event</b> from on-board unit sensors. The <b>event</b> table consists of <b>event</b> identity, type of <b>event,</b> time stamp of <b>event,</b> <b>event</b> location, <b>event</b> transmission range, <b>event</b> reputation value and <b>event</b> confidence value list. The <b>event</b> table stores each <b>event</b> separately and set <b>event</b> reputation value. The ERS uses aggregative <b>event</b> observation mechanism and reputation adoption mechanism. The <b>event</b> confidence threshold and <b>event</b> reputation threshold assess <b>event</b> intensity and reliability at the same time. The limitation of ERS is that <b>event</b> reputation value is low in high speed because of the sensor capability (minimum detection). The <b>event</b> confidence is small in low density. The other factors like <b>event</b> duration and transmission range also have an effect on ERS [84].|$|R

At the 1999 Pan American Games, O'Connor took an individual silver and team gold and at the 2002 World Equestrian Games he assisted the US team to gold. After his retirement from competition in 2004, he {{became involved in the}} administrative side of international <b>eventing.</b> O'Connor has held top coaching roles for the US and Canadian national <b>eventing</b> teams, and was president of the United States Equestrian Federation from 2004 to 2012. During his career, O'Connor and his horses were awarded many honors, including equestrian and horse of the year awards from several organizations. In 2009, he was inducted to the United States <b>Eventing</b> Association's Hall of Fame, and two of his horses have been granted the same honor.

5|$|The Selle Français is a French sport horse, now {{recognized}} internationally {{as a top}} breed for show jumping and three-day <b>eventing.</b> Selection criteria for breeding stock focuses on their jumping abilities. Show jumping is a technical sport, calling for lively and responsive yet powerful horses. Horses with more Thoroughbred blood in them have also been very competitive in three-day <b>eventing,</b> where speed and stamina are needed {{to be successful in}} all three portions (dressage, three-day <b>eventing</b> and show jumping) of the event. Thanks to these qualities, the Selle Français is seen on international show jumping and three-day <b>eventing</b> teams, both in France and elsewhere. In dressage, the Selle Français has gradually improved, but has faced stiff competition from northern European breeds, which often have more active gaits. In addition, many French breeders guide their horses to the more popular and profitable sport of show jumping, which sometimes deprives the dressage system of good horses. The World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses (WBFSH) ranks warmblood stud books based on their success in <b>eventing,</b> show jumping and dressage. In 2013, the ANSF was ranked as the 3rd best show jumping stud book in the world, topped only by the Dutch Warmblood and Belgian Warmblood breeds, and a Selle Français horse was ranked first in the world. The stud book was ranked at 6th in the world in <b>eventing,</b> with the top horse placed at 25th. The ANSF was ranked 19th in dressage, beaten by many of the more popular dressage breeds, including Dutch Warmbloods, Hanoverians and Westphalians.|$|E
5|$|At 18, Davidson {{tried out}} for the United States <b>eventing</b> team and was accepted. He won his first medal {{as a member of}} the silver-medal-winning US team at the 1972 Summer Olympics. After that, Davidson went to win gold at the 1976 and 1984 Olympics and silver in 1996, {{participating}} unsuccessfully in 1988. He has also competed repeatedly at both the World Equestrian Games and the Pan American Games, winning medals at both, as well as winning repeatedly at the top-level Badminton Horse Trials and Rolex Kentucky Three Day events. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Davidson was a consistently top-level rider on both the American and international <b>eventing</b> scenes. He is also known for his horse breeding and training abilities.|$|E

30|$|At {{the end of}} {{the view}} {{classification}} phase, we end up with classification of every frame of an <b>event</b> in one of the above-mentioned views. To recognize certain interesting <b>events</b> from sports videos, temporal transition patterns among the frames (views) within the <b>event</b> can be utilized. To formulate the pattern of an <b>event,</b> it is necessary to map low-level features into high-level semantic. For example, to detect a goal scoring <b>event,</b> there are temporal patterns such as more transitions that happen among goal post, close-up and audience views because every goal <b>event</b> is followed by gathering of players and cheers in the audience. If these patterns can be recognized for the <b>event</b> sequence, the corresponding <b>events</b> can be identified. To boost up the efficiency of the <b>event</b> classification, it takes low-impact and high-impact classes of <b>events</b> as inputs which are produced by the <b>event</b> categorization phase. Since card <b>events</b> are already detected using the yellow card <b>event</b> detection algorithm, card <b>event</b> segments are removed from the high- or low-impact class of <b>events.</b> The <b>event</b> classification system proposed here uses the hidden Markov model to classify goal <b>event,</b> goal attack and other <b>events</b> in a soccer video. High-impact <b>events</b> are classified into either a goal <b>event</b> or other <b>events</b> using a trained goal <b>event</b> model and other <b>event</b> models. Similarly, low-impact <b>events</b> are classified into goal attack or other <b>events</b> using a trained goal attack <b>event</b> model and other <b>event</b> models. HMM is described in following section.|$|R

25|$|SOA 2.0 {{event-driven}} {{programming is}} structured around {{the concept of}} decoupled relationships between <b>event</b> producers and <b>event</b> consumers: an <b>event</b> consumer doesn't care where or why an <b>event</b> occurs; rather, it's concerned {{that it will be}} invoked when the <b>event</b> has occurred.

An existing <b>event</b> viewer tool called eventvwr. exe can be used to view <b>events,</b> however, it can not display <b>events</b> dynamically.
