During that time, sophisticated methods of perturbation analysis were invented to calculate the deviations of orbits due to the influence of multiple bodies on a planet, moon, comet, or asteroid. The formalism was exact enough to allow mathematicians to predict the existence of the planet Neptune before it was observed.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} soundtrack {{was highly}} praised; reviewers noted {{it as one}} of the best video game soundtracks of the year, praising the originality of the compositions and the beauty of Emi Evans' vocal work. The first arranged album, while also warmly received, was perceived by critics to be weaker than the original and not long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up to the expectations created by the success of the original. The first three albums sold well enough to be recorded on the Japanese Oricon music charts, reaching number 24 for the original soundtrack, 59 for the first arranged album, and position number 77 for the second.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{were determined}} that the show be respectful of audience expectations for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director Dominic Brigstocke concluded that the material was strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase. Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking {{as closely as possible}} to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media conventions as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.|$|E

25|$|It is the {{simplest}} repeating pattern, and {{will create a}} wall only one-half brick thick. Such a thin wall is not stable <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> alone, and must be tied to a supporting structure. This practice is common in modern buildings, where stretcher bonded brickwork may be the outer face of a cavity wall, or the facing to a timber or steel-framed structure.|$|E
25|$|Denton {{continued}} to play with considerable success for Yorkshire until after World War I, making his highest score of 221 against Kent in 1912, and scoring 209 not out at Worcester as late as June 1920, just a month short of his 46th birthday. He retired {{at the end of}} that year, and though afflicted by ill-health for a time, recovered <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> as a first-class umpire regularly from 1925 to 1930, and in occasional matches until 1937.|$|E
25|$|The {{thickness}} of the ammolite layer {{is also an important}} factor: after polishing, the ammolite is only 0.1–0.3millimeters thick. The rarest and most valuable are thick <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> alone, with only a thin portion of its original matrix (not exceeding 1.5mm); but the vast majority require some sort of supportive backing. Other treatments are also commonly undertaken; all other factors being equal, the less treatment an ammolite gem has received, the more valuable it is. Calibrated stones—that is, stones fashioned into standard dimensions that will fit most jewelry settings—may also command a higher price.|$|E

25|$|In {{his later}} years, Cokayne became closely allied to Sir Richard Vernon. The Vernon family were the wealthiest and most {{powerful}} of the Derbyshire gentry, with large and widely spread estates, more {{like those of the}} local nobility. Sir Richard Vernon was too powerful to be easily absorbed into one of the aristocratic affinities but not strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> entirely alone. Cokayne, in a similar position, negotiated the tricky waters of politics in the king's minority alongside Vernon and often in close aliance with him. At the county's parliamentary election in 1432 he sealed the indenture returning Richard Vernon, Sir Richard's son, and {{at about the same time}} arranged the betrothal of his heir, John, to Vernon's daughter Anne.|$|E
25|$|That 1975 map, {{the first}} Cahill-Keyes projection, {{launched}} a decades long quest to perfect it. One of his goals is a map with a 1:1 million scale, {{about half the}} size of a football field. Each one degree geocell would be large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> in. While the physical Master Map as he calls it, remains a dream, in 2010, his partner Mary Jo Graça, using Keyes's extensive calculations, plotted the entire projection and in 2011 digitized the entire map. Absent the physical version, a 9,000 square foot pdf of that full size map can be easily navigated on a home computer. It is the first contiguous world map at a resolution showing all one-degree geocells (except five degrees at the poles). Keyes likewise commissioned the first-ever one-degree globe from Joe Roubal in 2013.|$|E
25|$|German beacons {{operated}} on the medium-frequency band and the signals involved a two-letter Morse identifier {{followed by a}} lengthy time-lapse which enabled the Luftwaffe crews to determine the signal's bearing. The Meacon system involved separate locations for a receiver with a directional aerial and a transmitter. The receipt of the German signal by the receiver was duly passed to the transmitter, the signal to be repeated. The action did not guarantee automatic success. If the German bomber flew closer to its own beam than the Meacon then the former signal would come through the stronger on the direction finder. The reverse would apply only if the meacon were closer. In general, German bombers were likely {{to get through to}} their targets without too much difficulty. It was to be some months before an effective night fighter force would be ready, and anti-aircraft defences only became adequate after the Blitz was over, so ruses were created to lure German bombers away from their targets. Throughout 1940, dummy airfields were prepared, good <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up to skilled observation. An unknown number of bombs fell on these diversionary ("Starfish") targets.|$|E

500|$|Q {{magazine}} {{had mixed}} reactions to 1987, {{saying that there}} are [...] "too few ideas being spread too thin". The magazine criticised some songs as [...] "overlong" [...] and questioned the overuse of sampling as [...] "the impression of a random hotchpotch". Q also unfavourably commented that The JAMs' [...] "use of the beatbox is altogether weedy". It liked some of its tracks: [...] "there are some wickedly amusing ideas and moments of pure poetry in the lyrics while some of the musical juxtapositions are both killingly funny and strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> repeated listenings".|$|E
500|$|Musicologist Dale Cockrell {{argues that}} [...] "Old Dan Tucker" [...] {{represents}} {{a bridge between}} the percussive blackface songs of the 1830s and the more refined compositions of songwriters such as Stephen Foster. Cockrell says that, unlike previous minstrel songs, [...] "Old Dan Tucker" [...] is meant for more than just dancing; its tune is developed <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> on its own. Contemporary critics certainly noticed the difference. Y. S. Nathanson called it [...] "the best of what I have denominated the ancient negro ballads. The melody is far superior to anything that had preceded it." [...] Nathanson compared the song to works by Gaetano Donizetti and Daniel Auber.|$|E

A classification of [...] "ship of the line" [...] – a class of ship that later evolved into the battleship – meant that a ship was powerful <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> in a line of battle and explained why these ships of commerce were sometimes mistaken for men-o-war. The armament was necessary for the ship to protect herself and her valuable cargo from pirates and commerce raiders of other nations during long voyages between Europe and the Far East. Arniston, like other East Indiamen, was slow and unmanoeuvrable, but able to carry a large quantity of cargo.|$|E

He learns to live and work [...] "in a semi-horizontal position"; he is the first white man to come to the island. He trades goods for birds-of-paradise; the people do not shoot them with blunt arrows like Aru islanders, but set out fruit as bait on a forked stick, and catch the birds with a noose of cord that hangs from the stick down to the ground, pulling the cord when the bird arrives, sometimes after two or three days.|$|E

[...] The New York Times, contrariwise, dinged X for [...] "trying to carry beauty of 'Clocks' across an entire album – not least in its first single, 'Speed of Sound,' which isn't the only song on the album to borrow the 'Clocks' drumbeat."

500|$|Foo Fighters earned mostly {{positive}} reviews upon release. Many critics {{compared the}} album to Grohl's previous band, Nirvana. Reviewer David Browne of Entertainment Weekly considered that [...] " [...] songs pack the riffy wallop of unpolished Nirvana demos, {{and his voice}} has Kurt Cobain's lunging, over-the-top passion." [...] Writing for Spin, Terri Sutton stylistically compared the album to Nirvana's second album, Nevermind, saying that [...] "the album's first half [...] owes much to Nevermind, and it's tempting to hear {{it in the way}} Nevermind taught us to hear." [...] Paul Rees of Kerrang! admitted that [...] "Foo Fighters cannot fail to evoke Kurt Cobain's memory, whether if through Grohl's ragged howl of a voice or the way a number of its songs go soft-soft-loud", but ultimately considered the record [...] "more than strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> or fall in its own merits". [...] Billboard complimented the [...] "inspired songwriting and passionate performances", adding the album could please grunge fans and [...] "also remind fans of other rock and punk taste makers, from Green Day and The Offspring to Better than Ezra." ...|$|E
500|$|Several interludes {{are placed}} {{throughout}} the album, named after video games, such as Street Fighter, Metal Gear Solid, GoldenEye 007 and Soulcalibur. This {{is reported to}} give the album a more nostalgic feel; the record is [...] "held together by tiny interludes named after 1990s video games in which the unmistakable sounds of a cassette player rewinding, fast-forwarding, and stopping are heard". On the track [...] "We All Try", Ocean speaks out against homophobia. According to The Guardian, [...] "Odd Future's frequent {{use of the word}} 'faggot' unsettled liberal stomachs", and that [...] "Ocean was brave <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> alone once more, declaring on 'We All Try': 'I believe that marriage isn't between a man and woman, but between love and love'. On the same song he reveals his opinion of the pro-choice debate: 'I believe a woman's temple, gives her the right to choose/ But baby don't abort.'" [...] He obliquely [...] "announces his support of a woman's right to choose and gay marriage", both of which are [...] "hardly typical r tropes." [...] The song contains [...] "smooth, bedroom-type grooves".|$|E
500|$|The King and I was revived at London's Adelphi Theatre on October 10, 1973, {{running for}} 260 {{performances}} until May 25, 1974, starring Sally Ann Howes as Anna and Peter Wyngarde as the King. [...] Roger Redfarn directed, and Sheila O'Neill choreographed. The production, {{which began in}} June 1973 with {{a tour of the}} English provinces, earned mixed to warm reviews. Michael Billington in The Guardian called the revival [...] "well played and well sung". Although he was enthusiastic about Howes as Anna, Billington thought Wyngarde [...] "too fragile to be capable of inspiring unholy terror". He praised Redfarn's production – [...] "whipped along at a good pace and made a sumptuous eyeful out of the interpolated ballet on 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'." [...] Less favorably, Robert Cushman in The Observer thought the production [...] "scenically and economically under-nourished". He liked Wyngarde's King ("a dignified clown") but thought Howes not formidable <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up to him as Anna. He noted that [...] "she sings beautifully and the songs are the evening's real justification".|$|E
