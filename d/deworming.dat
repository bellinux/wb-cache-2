25|$|In {{regions where}} {{helminthiasis}} is common, mass <b>deworming</b> treatments may be performed, particularly among school-age children, {{who are a}} high-risk group. Most of these initiatives are undertaken by the World Health Organization (WHO) with positive outcomes in many regions. <b>Deworming</b> programs can improve school attendance by 25 percent. Although <b>deworming</b> improves the health of an individual, outcomes from mass <b>deworming</b> campaigns, such as reduced deaths or increases in cognitive ability, nutritional benefits, physical growth, and performance, are uncertain or not apparent.|$|E
25|$|One {{strategy}} {{to control the}} disease in areas where it is common is the treatment of entire groups of people regardless of symptoms via mass drug administration. This is often done among school-age children and is known as <b>deworming.</b> While testing and treating children who are infected looks like it is effective, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that routine <b>deworming,</b> {{in the absence of}} a positive test, improves nutrition, haemoglobin, school attendance or school performance.|$|E
25|$|Further {{preventive}} measures include adherence to appropriate food hygiene, wearing of shoes, regular <b>deworming</b> of pets, {{and the proper}} disposal of their feces.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of protein supplementation and parasite load in relation to testicular morphology, in young Santa Inês male sheep. Twentyfour male lambs, non-castrated, were distributed in four treatments: HPd (<b>dewormed</b> animals + diet with high protein), HPn (animals non <b>dewormed</b> + diet with high protein), LPd (<b>dewormed</b> animals + diet with low protein), LPn (animals not <b>dewormed</b> + diet with low protein) during eight months. At {{the end of the}} experiment histological cuts of testicles were taken and cell count analyzed by computer and the program IMAGE PRO-PLUS was used for evaluation of measurements of the seminiferous tubules. The following results were found: LPn presented larger number of spermatogonias, but a reduced number of the other cells parameters (Sertoli cells, spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa) and smaller diameter and circumference of the seminiferous tubules and shorter seminiferous epithelium when compared to other treatments. There was a significant correlation among tubules diameter of the epithelium height and tubules circumference. Correlations between lumen diameter and lumen circumference, as well as epithelium height and tubules circumference also presented high and positive correlations (r> 0. 70). When the external testis parameters were compared with internal parameters no significant correlation was observed (r 0, 70); comparando-se os parâmetros testiculares externos com os internos, observa-se que não houve correlação significativa (P< 0, 50). Conclui-se que a alta proteína influencia positivamente a espermatogênese, e a não-vermifugação associada a uma dieta pobre em proteínas pioram substancialmente a maioria dos parâmetros reprodutivos de carneiros jovens Santa Inês...|$|R
25|$|However, this {{approach}} {{does not appear}} to prevent drug resistance, and many veterinarians now recommend individualized <b>deworming</b> plans dependent upon the horse's age and egg shedding status.|$|E
25|$|Chronic immune {{responses}} to helminthiasis {{may lead to}} increased susceptibility to other infections such as tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria. There is conflicting information about whether <b>deworming</b> reduces HIV progression and viral load and increases CD4 counts in antiretroviral naive and experienced individuals.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{not walking}} barefoot where {{the disease is}} common. At a {{population}} level, decreasing outdoor defecation, not using feces as fertilizer, and mass <b>deworming</b> is effective. Treatment is typically with the medications albendazole or mebendazole for one to three days. Iron supplements may be needed in those with anemia.|$|E
40|$|Using dogs such as ones spontaneously {{infected}} with hookworms, ones <b>dewormed</b> of these hookworms, those experimentally {{infected with}} hookworms showing marked intestinal hemorrhage {{as well as}} normal dogs (the control), and orally administering them radioactive iron, Fe(59), the author determined the radioactive iron in erythrocytes and plasm periodically. Then 48 hours later perfusion is given and fractionating the visceral iron by Yoneyama-Konno's method, the iron contents and Fe(59) are estimated. As the results, {{it has been found}} that the iron-absorption rate is lowest in the dogs spontaneously infected with hookworms, followed in an ascending order of normal dogs and <b>dewormed</b> dogs, and highest in the dogs with experimental hookworm disease. As for the distribution of Fe(59) absorbed, in the spontaneously infected dogs it is distributed mostly in the liver, spleen and bone marrow, demonstrating an extremely low portion of it taken into erythrocytes. In the <b>dewormed</b> dogs, on the contrary, the major portion of the absorbed Fe(59) is taken up by erythrocytes and it is sparsely distributed in the liver, spleen and bone marrow, and this tendency is still more marked in the dogs with experimental hookworm disease, Furthermore, the iron contents of various organs in the dogs spontaneously infected with hookworms, though slightly less than in the normal, are greater than those found in the <b>dewormed</b> dogs, proving a marked decrease in the dogs with experimental hookworm disease. From these data it is assumed that there is a definite impediment to the absorption and mobilization of iron in hookworm disease and that such an impediment together with hemorrhage induce anemia...|$|R
30|$|Preventive {{and control}} {{measures}} were taken against major diseases in the region.

25|$|Roundworms infect {{hundreds}} of millions of people. There is evidence that high intensities of worms in the intestines can affect mental performance, but a systematic review in 2000 and a 2009 update found that there was insufficient evidence to show that <b>deworming</b> treatments improve cognitive performance or school performance in children.|$|E
25|$|Helminths {{may cause}} iron-deficiency anemia. This is most severe in heavy {{hookworm}} infections, as Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale feed {{directly on the}} blood of their hosts. Although the daily consumption of an individual worm (0.02–0.07 ml and 0.14–0.26 ml respectively) is small, the collective consumption under heavy infection can be clinically significantly. Intestinal whipworm may also cause anemia. Anemia has also been associated with reduced stamina for physical labor, {{a decline in the}} ability to learn new information, and apathy, irritability, and fatigue. A study of the effect of <b>deworming</b> and iron supplementation in 47 students from the Democratic Republic of the Congo found that the intervention improved cognitive function. Another study found that in 159 Jamaican schoolchildren, <b>deworming</b> led to better auditory short-term memory and scanning and retrieval of long-term memory over a period of nine-weeks.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition due to worms {{can give}} rise to anorexia. A study of 459 {{children}} in Zanzibar revealed spontaneous increases in appetite after <b>deworming.</b> Anorexia might {{be a result of}} the body’s immune response and the stress of combating infection. Specifically, some of the cytokines released in the immune response to worm infestation have been linked to anorexia in animals.|$|E

25|$|School-based mass <b>deworming</b> {{programs}} {{have been the most}} popular strategy {{to address the issue of}} hookworm infection in children. School-based programs are extremely cost-effective as schools already have an available, extensive, and sustained infrastructure with a skilled workforce that has a close relationship with the community. With little training from a local health system, teachers can easily administer the drugs which often cost less than US$0.50 per child per year.|$|E
25|$|Broad-spectrum benzimidazoles (such as {{albendazole}} and mebendazole) are {{the first}} line treatment of intestinal roundworm and tapeworm infections. Macrocyclic lactones (such as ivermectin) are effective against adult and migrating larval stages of nematodes. Praziquantel is the drug of choice for schistosomiasis, taeniasis, and most types of food-borne trematodiases. Oxamniquine is also widely used in mass <b>deworming</b> programmes. Pyrantel is commonly used for veterinary nematodiasis. Artemisinins and derivatives are proving to be candidates as drugs of choice for trematodiasis.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of colic {{can be reduced}} by restricted access to simple carbohydrates including sugars from feeds with excessive molasses, providing clean feed and drinking water, preventing the ingestion of dirt or sand by using an elevated feeding surface, a regular feeding schedule, regular <b>deworming,</b> regular dental care, a regular diet that does not change substantially in content or proportion and prevention of heatstroke. Horses that bolt their feed {{are at risk of}} colic, and several management techniques may be used to slow down the rate of feed consumption.|$|E

25|$|The Centers for Disease Control traced {{outbreaks}} of agranulocytosis among cocaine users, in the US and Canada between March 2008 and November 2009, {{to the presence}} of levamisole in the drug supply. The Drug Enforcement Administration reported that, as of February 2010, 71% of seized cocaine lots coming into the US contained levamisole as a cutting agent. Levamisole is an antihelminthic (i.e. <b>deworming)</b> drug used in animals. The reason for adding levamisole to cocaine is unknown, although it can be due to their similar melting points and solubilities.|$|E
25|$|Many mass <b>deworming</b> {{programs}} also combine their efforts {{with a public}} health education. These health education programs often stress important preventative techniques such as: washing your hands before eating, and staying away from water/areas contaminated by human feces. These programs may also stress that shoes must be worn, however, these come with their own health risks {{and may not be}} effective. Shoe wearing patterns in towns and villages across the globe are determined by cultural beliefs, and the levels of education within that society. The wearing of shoes will prevent the entry of hookworm infections from the surrounding soils into tender skin regions; such as areas between the toes.|$|E
25|$|Strategies {{to provide}} {{education}} cost effectively include <b>deworming</b> children, which costs about 50 cents per child {{per year and}} reduces non-attendance from anemia, illness and malnutrition, while being only a twenty-fifth as expensive as increasing school attendance by constructing schools. Schoolgirl absenteeism could be cut in half by simply providing free sanitary towels. Fortification with micronutrients was ranked the most cost effective aid strategy by the Copenhagen Consensus. For example, iodised salt costs 2 to 3 cents per person a year while even moderate iodine deficiency in pregnancy shaves off 10 to 15 IQ points. Paying for school meals is argued to be an efficient strategy in increasing school enrollment, reducing absenteeism and increasing student attention.|$|E

40|$|Faeces of 484 {{horses were}} sampled twice with an {{interval}} of 6 weeks while anthelmintic therapy was halted. Faecal eggs counts revealed that 267 (55. 2 %) horses had consistently low numbers of eggs per gram faeces (EPG) (EPG 100). Horses with consistently high EPGs were more often mares {{with access to}} pasture, aged less than 6 or more than 23 years, that were <b>dewormed</b> at intervals longer than 6 months, and were treated {{for the last time}} more than 3 months {{before the start of the}} study. Horses with consistently low EPGs were more often male horses with no or limited access to pasture, that were <b>dewormed</b> at maximally 6 -month intervals, and were aged between 6 and 23 years. The results are an indication that some horses have consistently low EPGs and perhaps could be used as non-treated animals in a selective anthelmintic treatment scheme aimed at the prevention of the development of anthelmintic resistance...|$|R
25|$|This lack of <b>deworming</b> of {{pregnant}} women is {{explained by the fact}} that most individuals still fear that anthelmintic treatment will result in adverse birth outcomes. But a 2006 study by Gyorkos et al. found that when comparing a group {{of pregnant}} women treated with mebendazole with a control placebo group, both illustrated rather similar rates in adverse birth outcomes. The treated group demonstrated 5.6% adverse birth outcomes, while the control group had 6.25% adverse birth outcomes. Furthermore, Larocque et al. illustrated that treatment for hookworm infection actually led to positive health results in the infant. This study concluded that treatment with mebendazole plus iron supplements during antenatal care significantly reduced the proportion of very low birth weight infants when compared to a placebo control group. Studies so far have validated recommendations to treat infected pregnant women for hookworm infection during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that a third of}} all pregnant women in developing countries are infected with hookworm, 56% of all pregnant women in developing countries suffer from anemia, 20% of all maternal deaths are either directly or indirectly related to anemia. Numbers like this have led to an increased interest in the topic of hookworm-related anemia during pregnancy. With the understanding that chronic hookworm infection can often lead to anemia, many people are now questioning if the treatment of hookworm could effect change in severe anemia rates and thus also on maternal and child health as well. Most evidence suggests that the contribution of hookworm to maternal anemia merits that all women of child-bearing age living in endemic areas be subject to periodic anthelmintic treatment. The World Health Organization even recommends that infected pregnant women be treated after their first trimester. Regardless of these suggestions, only Madagascar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have added <b>deworming</b> to their antenatal care programs.|$|E
