40|$|Chiral ion-pairs {{are playing}} an {{increasingly}} important role in asymmetric catalysis. In {{order to understand the}} source of molecular recognition, a simple model system based on a BINAP-Rh(dialkene) cation and a BINOL borate anion was studied for both diastereomeric forms. It was discovered that one of these was energetically preferred and methods for quantifying the difference were devised using 31 P NMR. The effect was general over a series of bis-binaphthyl borate anions, and required cycloocta- 1, 5 -diene rather than bicyclohepta[2. 2. 1]diene as the <b>dialkene</b> component. The 1 H NMR spectra of the cation in the parent ion pairs showed a range of anion-induced chemical shifts, their specificity implying selectivity in the ion-pair contact. X-ray structures of the two cyclooctadiene complexes were obtained and it proved possible to analyse the preferred contacts of individual ion-pairs. Rather than involving specific π-π, CH-π and CH-O intermolecular forces, the preference for one diastereomer in the COD case is based on dispersion forces that respond to the ability to pack the <b>dialkene,</b> and particularly its sp 3 units, for maximum interaction with a concave naphthyl fragment. This interpretation is supported by analysis of one related NBD complex. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|E

We previously reported the synthesis of an alkene-functionalized 3, 4 -propylenedioxy-thiophene (ProDOT) derivative that could be readily modified through thiol–ene “click” chemistry. Here, we investigated the post-polymerization modification of PProDOT surfaces by using a <b>dialkene</b> functionalized variant (ProDOT-diene). The chemical structure of the ProDOT-diene monomer was confirmed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The ProDOT-diene monomer was either chemically or electrochemically polymerized into the PProDOT-diene polymer, and then subsequently modified with alkyl, PEG, or ferrocene moieties via radical-based thiol–ene chemistry. We found that the normally insoluble PProDOT-diene could be converted into a soluble derivative by grafting alkyl groups onto the polymer chains after chemical polymerization. When electrochemically deposited on indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass electrodes, the conductivity, electroactivity and contact angles of the modified PProDOT-diene films could be tuned over a broad range. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed that post-polymerization modification did not significantly alter the surface morphology of the PProDOT-diene films. Overall, this method allows for efficient, facile tuning of the surface chemistry of poly(alkylthiophene) films, {{making it possible to}} tailor properties such as conductivity and wettability for different applications.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of plastic waste is extensively studied nowadays. Of the treatments available, thermal degradation is attracting great interest {{because it offers}} the possibility of recovering energy and useful chemicals. PE pyrolysis has already been discussed in a previous paper [1] where the rate of decomposition of a sample was modeled using a detailed kinetic scheme. Its predictions were validated by thermogravimetric experimental results across wide operative pressure and heating rate ranges. The gas product distribution {{was derived from the}} random scission hypothesis. Thus, the ratio of alkane, alkene and <b>dialkene</b> species was 1 : 2 : 1 and, within the same class of products, the distribution was equimolecular, except for those species which are more favored by allyl resonance. This paper aims to continue the previous work in attempting to model gas products correctly. The principal improvements made here are the introduction of backbiting reactions into the kinetic scheme to predict the larger amounts of selected products and the consideration of the physical aspects of the degradation process. These phenomena are responsible for the production rate and the distribution of volatiles. A simplified model of the in-depth mass transfer through bubble formation is presented which describes the degradation progress for a small-sized polyethylene sample. The model predictions are compared with both the experimental results of polyethylene pyrolysis performed under various temperature conditions and with thermogravimetric analysis.

40|$|Liquid {{crystalline}} <b>dialkenes</b> and diepoxides having different {{structural parameters}} were prepared and characterized. The compounds contained {{two or three}} aromatic rings in the mesogenic core. The base structure for the compounds containing two aromatic rings is the 4 -(omega-oxiranylalkoxy) benzoic acid 4 -(omega-oxiranylalkoxy) phenyl ester and for the compounds containing three aromatic rings the 4 -{[4 -(omega-oxiranylalkoxy) benzoyl]oxy}phenyl 4 -(omega-oxiranylalkoxy) benzoate. The hydroquinone moiety is either unsubstituted or contains polar nitrile or fluorine groups as substituents. The flexible spacers consist of different numbers of methylene groups terminated with double bonds or epoxide groups. Some of the diepoxides undergo thermal polymerization of the epoxide group during {{the determination of the}} transition temperatures, and therefore the <b>dialkenes</b> were also investigated because of their almost analogous phase behaviour, but with higher thermal stability. Most of the compounds studied show liquid crystalline behaviour. A systematic study is presented of the influence of structural parameters such as the number of aromatic rings in the mesogenic core, substituents and length of the flexible side chain, on the transition temperatures.

40|$|Initiator could {{accelerate}} {{the rate of}} hydrocarbon pyrolysis and reduce the required material temperatures for a hypersonic aircraft heat exchanger/reactor. Nitroalkanes were proposed as the effective initiator because of the lower CN bond dissociation energy. In order to investigate the initiation mechanism of nitroalkanes on hydrocarbon pyrolysis, the pyrolysis of n-decane, nitromethane and their binary mixture were carried out at 30, 150 and 760  Torr in a flow reactor with synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS). The identified and quantified pyrolysis species include C 1 C 2 alkanes, C 2 C 10 alkenes, C 3 C 6 <b>dialkenes,</b> C 2 C 3 alkynes, nitrogen oxides such as NO and NO 2, benzene, and radicals including CH 3, C 3 H 3, and C 3 H 5, which {{shed light on the}} mechanism of n-decane and nitromethane pyrolysis, as well as the interactions of these two fuels. The experimental results indicate that the addition of nitromethane decreases the initial decomposition temperature of n-decane, and a stronger promotion effect could be obtained as the experimental pressure increases. The distributions of alkanes, alkenes, <b>dialkenes,</b> alkynes and benzene are also influenced by the addition of nitromethane. A detailed kinetic model with 266 species and 1648 reactions was developed and validated against the mole fraction profiles of reactants, major products and important intermediates during the pyrolysis of each fuel and their binary mixture. The satisfactory model prediction to the experimental measurements permits the analysis of the kinetic effect of nitromethane initiation on the pyrolysis of n-decane. So that, the increase of the conversion rate at a lower temperature, the selectivity of decomposition products, and reduction of benzene formation are better understood...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an inherently}} fluorescent self-reporting step-growth polymer {{system as well}} as a fluorescence-based methodology for accessing the kinetics of the underpinning photoinduced nitrile imine-mediated tetra-zole-ene cycloaddition (NITEC) process, using an equimolar mixture of a bismaleimide linker and a bifunctional alpha,omega- tetrazole-chain transfer agent (CTA). Similarly, alpha,omega-tetrazole-capped polystyrene, prepared via RAFT polymerization, was employed as a photoreactive macromonomer. Upon UV irradiation, the tetrazole moiety readily reacts with activated <b>dialkenes</b> producing the fluorescent pyrazoline-containing polymer. Thus, the fluorescence emission of the step-growth polymers is directly correlated with the number of ligation points in the polymer, forming an ideal self-reporting sensor system.

40|$|Waste plastic {{disposal}} {{and excessive}} use of fossil fuels have caused environment concerns in the world. Both plastics and petroleum derived fuels are hydrocarbons that contain the elements of carbon and hydrogen. The difference between them is that plastic molecules have longer carbon chains than those in LPG, petrol, and diesel fuels. Therefore, {{it is possible to}} convert waste plastic into fuels. The main objectives of this study were to understand and optimize the processes of plastic pyrolysis for maximizing the diesel range products, and to design a continuous pyrolysis apparatus as a semi-scale commercial plant. Pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS) has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally in a lab-scale pyrolysis reactor. The key factors have been investigated and identified. The cracking temperature for PE and PP in the pyrolysis is at 450 ºC, but that of PS is lower, at 320 ºC. High reaction temperature and heating rate can significantly promote the production of light hydrocarbons. Long residence time also favours the yield of the light hydrocarbon products. The effects of other factors like type of reactor, catalyst, pressure and reflux rate have also been investigated in the literature review. From the literature review, the pyrolysis reaction consists of three progressive steps: initiation, propagation, and termination. Initiation reaction cracks the large polymer molecules into free radicals. The free radicals and the molecular species can be further cracked into smaller radicals and molecules during the propagation reactions. β-scission is the dominant reaction in the PE propagation reactions. At last, the radicals will combine together into stable molecules, which are termination reactions. There are three types of cracking of the polymers: random cracking, chain strip cracking, and end chain cracking. The major cracking on the polymer molecular backbone is random cracking. Some cracking occurs at the ends of the molecules or the free radicals, which is end chain cracking. Some polymers have reactive functional side group on their molecular backbones. The functional groups will break off the backbone, which is chain strip cracking. Chain strip cracking is the dominant cracking reaction during polystyrene pyrolysis. The reaction kinetics was investigated in this study. The activation energy and the energy requirement for the pyrolysis are dependent on the reaction process and the distribution of the final products. Following the equations from other literatures, the theoretical energy requirement for pyrolyze 1 kg PE is 1. 047 MJ. The estimated calorific value of the products is about 43. 3 MJ/kg. Therefore, the energy profit is very high for this process. The PE pyrolysis products are mainly 1 -alkenes, n-alkanes, and α, ω-dialkenes ranging from C 1 to C 45 +. The 1 -alkenes and the n-alkanes were identified with a special method developed in this research. It was found that secondary cracking process has a significant influence on the distribution of the product. This process converts heavy hydrocarbons into gas or light liquid product and significantly reduces 1 -alkenes and α, ω-dialkenes. This secondary process can be controlled by adjusting the reflux rate of the primary product. The product of PE pyrolysis with maximized diesel range output consist of 18. 3 % non-condensable gases, 81. 7 % w/w liquid product, and less than 1 % pure carbon under high reflux rate process. Some zeolite catalysts were tested to reduce the heavy molecular weight wax. It was found that NKC- 5 (ZSM- 5) was the most effective catalyst among zeolites tested. The proportion of the non-condensable gases was promoted from 17 % w/w to 58 % w/w by adding 10 % w/w NKC- 5 into the PE feedstock. The products of PP pyrolysis are mainly methyl- oligomers. The reflux effect on the product from pyrolysis of PP is not as great as that on PE. The PP pyrolysis product with high reflux rate consists of 15. 7 % non-condensable gases, 84. 2 % condensed liquid product, and less than 0. 25 % char. Cyclohexane is the dominant component, 21 %w/w in the liquid product. 44 %v/v of the non-condensable gases is propene. In the pyrolysis product of PS, there are 4 % non-condensable gases, 93 % liquid, and 3 % char. Styrene accounts for 68. 59 %w/w in the PS liquid pyrolysis products due to the chain strip reactions. There was 19 % v/v hydrogen in the gas product, which did not exist in the PE pyrolysis gas product. The composition of the char is almost pure carbon, which is similar to that from PE pyrolysis. The mixture of virgin and post-consumer PE, PP and PS have also been investigated to identify the feedstock interaction and the effect of the contamination on the product. The interaction promotes the production of non-condensable gases. However, the effect of the interaction on the distribution of total product is not significant. Contamination of paper labels on the post-consumer plastics may result in higher solid residue in the product but no significant effect on the product was found in this study. Based on the achievements, a continuous semi-scale reactor has been designed and constructed at maximum capacity of 27. 11 kg/hr in this research. From the experiments of pyrolysis of both virgin PE and post-consumer PE on this semi-scale pyrolysis reactor, {{it was found that the}} major components are 1 -alkenes, n-alkanes, and α, ω- <b>dialkenes.</b> The distribution of the condensed products of PE pyrolysis from the semiscale reactor is the same as that of the products from low reflux rate process with the lab-scale reactor. However, the proportion of non-condensable gases is much higher than that from pyrolysis in the lab-scale tests with low reflux rate because the semiscale plant has higher reaction temperature and heating rate. Lower proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbons was found in the condensed product from the post-consumer PE pyrolysis than in the virgin PE product because of the contamination on the postconsumer PE. The actual energy consumption for cracking and vaporizing PE into fuels is 1. 328 MJ/kg which is less than 3 % of the calorific value of the pyrolysis products. Therefore, the pyrolysis technology has very high energy profit, 42. 3 MJ/kg PE, and is environmental-friendly. The oil produced has very high quality and close to the commercial petroleum derived liquid fuels. The experience of design and operation of the semi-scale plant will be helpful for building a commercial scale plant in the future...|$|R
