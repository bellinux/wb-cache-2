40|$|River waves {{under an}} ice cover {{have been studied}} in recent {{theoretical}} works. It has been postulated that certain types of small-amplitude waves, as may occur shortly before breakup, can generate sufficient bending moments to fracture the cover. However, the period of such waves is too short to “register ” in standard water-level gauge recordings {{and there is no}} evidence as to their existence and properties. Using specially designed instrumentation, a first attempt to record the passage and characteristics of pre-breakup river waves was made in March 2000, on the S. W. Miramichi River, NB. During the three-day monitoring interval, extending to a few hours before local breakup initiation, numerous waves were recorded, with amplitudes and periods of 0. 5 - 2. 0 cm, and 70 - 300 s, respectively. Typically, the waves occurred in sets of three or four similar, though not identical, sinusoidal forms. Using local hydraulic data, it was estimated that the recorded waves were in the <b>gravity</b> <b>band</b> with wavelengths between 270 and 1500 m. Using previous theoretical formulations, {{it was found that the}} observed waves were too “flat ” to fracture the ice cover. It is planned that future measurements include simultaneous recordings with two transducers, to permit direct determination of wave celerity; and extend right through the breakup event to also record waves that may result from ice-jam releases. 1...|$|E

40|$|Some {{current meter}} data {{obtained}} from a mooring at 2450 m water depth near the continental slope off Portugal are presented. The mean currents at five levels with observations are northward. Mean speeds {{in the core of}} the Mediterranean Water exceed speeds at shallower levels by 2 to 3 cm/sec, indicating advection connected to this specific water mass. The current variability is dominated by semi-diurnal tidal components. Normal mode analysis reveals a predominant mode of order 2, representing 48 % of the total kinetic tidal energy. Results for the barotropic tidal component are in good agreement with earlier predictions for this area. The motion at higher frequencies w in the internal <b>gravity</b> wave <b>band</b> can be well described by a w**- 2 power law for the energy density spectrum. This result is consistent with earlier observations {{in other parts of the}} ocean...|$|R
