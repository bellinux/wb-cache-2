5000|$|In West Iberian-Romance, the {{position}} of clitic object pronouns {{with respect to the}} verbs which govern them was flexible, but all Romance languages have since adopted a more strict syntax. The usual pattern is for clitics to precede the verb; e.g. Sp. Yo te amo, Fr. <b>Je</b> <b>taime</b> [...] "I love you"; Fr. Tu mavais dit [...] "You had told me" [...] (proclisis). The opposite order occurs only with the imperative: Sp. Dime, Fr. Dis-moi [...] "Tell me" [...] (enclisis). Spoken Brazilian Portuguese has taken {{more or less the same}} route, except that clitics usually appear between the auxiliary verb and the main verb in compound tenses, and proclisis is even more generalized: Eu te amo [...] "I love you", but Me diz [...] "Tell me", and Você tinha me dito [...] "You had told me".|$|E
5000|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film a B {{regarding}} the film [...] "takes the wrinkle-free, easy-travel concept first executed in the 2007 Gallic compilation Paris, <b>je</b> <b>taime</b> {{to a new}} city and styles itself..." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 stars saying in his review, [...] "By its nature, [...] "New York, I Love You" [...] cant add up. It remains {{the sum of its}} parts." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film a mixed review claiming [...] "Not that the 11 shorts in New York, I Love You are all that bad. Its a nice-looking city, after all, even if the interstitial skyline and traffic montages assembled by Randy Balsmeyer are about as fresh as the postcards on sale in Times Square." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film 1 star claiming [...] "there were two additional segments that have since been cut. So youll {{have to wait for the}} DVD to see just how bad Scarlett Johanssons directing debut is." ...|$|E
5000|$|Erica Abeel of The Hollywood Reporter writes [...] "New York, I Love You {{continues}} the Cities of Love series {{that began with}} Paris, <b>je</b> <b>taime</b> far surpassing it. (...) The vignettes are tied together into a single feature through a recurrent character, a videographer who interacts with the other characters. And transitional elements -- choreographed by 11th director Randy Balsmeyer -- move the viewer from one world to another, uniting all these intimate stories into a single shimmering fabric." [...] "With younger, less-tested directing talent, the film plays down the delineation between one directors work and another, opting to blend them through loosely interconnected characters here and there. As opposed to its directing roster, however, the cast boasts quite a few big names, all of which lend a surprising amount of authenticity to these funny, imaginative little stories," [...] explains Heidi Patalano of Metro New York giving the film a 4 grade out of 5. Claudia Puig of USA Today explains that anthologies are {{by their very nature}} an uneven entity and adds [...] "The multicultural emphasis - both in characters and in the unusual selection and collaboration of filmmakers and artists - is one of New York, I Love Yous main assets. And theres no question that Manhattan looks ever-vibrant and beautiful." ...|$|E
