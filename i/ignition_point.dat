25|$|The <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> for the {{definition}} of modernism as a movement was the austere rejection of popular culture as kitsch by important post-war artists and taste-makers, most notably Clement Greenberg with his essay Avant-Garde and Kitsch, first published in Partisan Review in 1939. During the 1940s and 1950s Greenberg {{proved to be an}} articulate and powerful art critic. In particular his writing on American Abstract expressionism, and 20th-century European modernism persuasively made the case for High art and culture. In 1961 Art and Culture, Beacon Press, a highly influential collection of essays by Clement Greenberg was first published. Greenberg is primarily thought of as a formalist art critic and many of his most important essays are crucial to the understanding of Modern art history, and the history of modernism and Late Modernism.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} {{study of the}} pure deflagration model of Type Ia supernovae using three-dimensional, high-resolution, full-star hydrodynamical simulations, nucleosynthetic yields calculated using Lagrangian tracer particles, and light curves calculated using radiation transport. We evaluate the simulations by comparing their predicted light curves with many observed SNe Ia using the SALT 2 data-driven model and find that the simulations may correspond to under-luminous SNe Iax. We explore {{the effects of the}} initial conditions on our results by varying the number of randomly selected <b>ignition</b> <b>points</b> from 63 to 3500, and the radius of the centered sphere they are confined in from 128 to 384 km. We find that the rate of nuclear burning depends on the number of <b>ignition</b> <b>points</b> at early times, the density of <b>ignition</b> <b>points</b> at intermediate times, and the radius of the confining sphere at late times. The results depend primarily on the number of <b>ignition</b> <b>points,</b> but we do not expect this to be the case in general. The simulations with few <b>ignition</b> <b>points</b> release more nuclear energy E_nuc, have larger kinetic energies E_K, and produce more ^ 56 Ni than those with many <b>ignition</b> <b>points,</b> and differ in the distribution of ^ 56 Ni, Si, and C/O in the ejecta. For these reasons, the simulations with few <b>ignition</b> <b>points</b> exhibit higher peak B-band absolute magnitudes M_B and light curves that rise and decline more quickly; their M_B and light curves resemble those of under-luminous SNe Iax, while those for simulations with many <b>ignition</b> <b>points</b> are not.

However, these tests were conducted using the new Mark 83 1000lb bombs, which featured relatively stable Composition H6 explosive and thicker, heat-resistant cases, compared to their predecessors; H6, which is still used in many types of naval ordnance due to its relative insensitivity to heat, shock and electricity, is also designed to deflagrate instead of detonate when it reaches its <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> in a fire, either melting the case and producing no explosion at all, or, at most, a subsonic low order detonation {{at a fraction of}} its normal power.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, the USAF began a {{structural}} reinforcement program {{to extend the}} aircraft's service life from the designed 3,000 flying hours to 7,000.

During the Vietnam War, combat losses constituted as many as 50 aircraft per year. On 7 June 1957, an F-100D fitted with an Astrodyne booster rocket making 150,000lbf (667.2kN) of thrust successfully performed a zero length launch (ZeLL).

25|$|Radical {{movements}} and trends regarded as influential and potentially as precursors to postmodernism emerged around World War I {{and particularly in}} its aftermath. With {{the introduction of the}} use of industrial artifacts in art and techniques such as collage, avant-garde movements such as Cubism, Dada and Surrealism questioned the nature and value of art. New artforms, such as cinema and the rise of reproduction, influenced these movements as a means of creating artworks. The <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> for the definition of modernism, Clement Greenberg's essay, Avant-Garde and Kitsch, first published in Partisan Review in 1939, defends the avant-garde in the face of popular culture. Later, Peter Bürger would make a distinction between the historical avant-garde and modernism, and critics such as Krauss, Huyssen, and Douglas Crimp, following Bürger, identified the historical avant-garde as a precursor to postmodernism. Krauss, for example, describes Pablo Picasso's use of collage as an avant-garde practice anticipating postmodern art with its emphasis on language at the expense of autobiography. Another point of view is avant-garde and modernist artists used similar strategies and postmodernism repudiates both.|$|E

40|$|This work {{provides}} {{the current status}} of a research effort aimed at developing a long term fire risk map of Europe, which will be included as a component of the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). The fire risk model adopted for the assessment is based on the approach that combines fire occurrence and fire outcome, thus encompassing probability of ignition, estimated fire behavior and expected consequences, and aiming to integrate physical, biological and socio-economic factors. The first step has been the enhancement of the fire occurrence data stored in the European Fire Database of EFFIS, in which recorded fire ignitions exhibit a certain degree of geo-location uncertainty. Location of fire <b>ignition</b> <b>points</b> is given in most cases as administrative district without geographical coordinates. Therefore methods to approximate density estimations of the spatial distribution of fire <b>ignition</b> <b>points</b> are needed. One of the options tested in this study is the use of land cover data to constrain the geo-location of the <b>ignition</b> <b>points</b> recorded in a given administrative district inside the boundaries of the fire spatial domain (i. e. forested and wildland areas). The point distribution is made randomly or with a weighted probability filtering, and a continuous surface is then created by kernel density methods. A second step is the analysis of potential variables affecting fire occurrence. The list of these variables is being compiled on the basis of extensive literature review and experts¿ knowledge. The final selection of the variables {{to be used in the}} model will be based on data availability and exploratory statistical analysis. To assess the significance of the predictor variables in fire occurrence, several alternative methods are being explored, among which are logistic regression and geographically weighted regression. The methodology firstly developed for the Euro-Mediterranean region will then be applied to the other European countries, making the necessary adjustments to cope with the specific conditions of each area.
