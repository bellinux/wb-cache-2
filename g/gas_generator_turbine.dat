50|$|The Ardiden 1H series engines have a radial {{air intake}} and a {{two-stage}} centrifugal compressor {{driven by a}} single stage axial <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine.</b> Airflow is directed through a reverse flow annular combustion chamber, through the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> and then through and a two-stage axial free power turbine. Output power is transmitted to a front-mounted reduction gearbox by a shaft concentrically mounted within the gas generator rotor assembly. The accessory gearbox, also mounted at the front end, {{is driven by the}} gas generator. Control is by means of a dual-channel digital engine electronic control unit (DECU).|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} to the gas-generator cycle over its counterpart, the staged combustion cycle. The <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> {{does not need}} to deal with the counter pressure of injecting the exhaust into the combustion chamber. This simplifies plumbing and turbine design, and results in a less expensive and lighter engine.|$|E
50|$|Turboshaft {{engines are}} often used to drive {{compression}} trains (for example in gas pumping stations or natural gas liquefaction plants) and are used to power almost all modern helicopters. The primary shaft bears the compressor and the high speed turbine (often {{referred to as the}} Gas Generator), while a second shaft bears the low-speed turbine (a power turbine or free-wheeling turbine on helicopters, especially, because the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> spins separately from the power turbine). In effect the separation of the gas generator, by a fluid coupling (the hot energy-rich combustion gases), from the power turbine is analogous to an automotive transmission's fluid coupling. This arrangement is used to increase power-output flexibility with associated highly-reliable control mechanisms.|$|E

This document describes the design, installation, {{and operation of}} an improved measurement system for the aerothermodynamic flow path states in an Allison T 63 -A- 700 (C 250 - 18 civilian designation). Temperature measurements for the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> and exhaust state points were evaluated and average values were calculated. The measurement uncertainty for airflow, fuel flow, and output power {{has been reduced to}} less than 3 %. State points match installation design data within 3 %. The digital scanning array has improved the accuracy of the pressure measurements and added the ability to measure pressure differences over time. The added bellmouth pressure sensors provide a redundant pressure measurement that is more accurate than the dynamometer system. The <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> inlet and exhaust temperature profiles have been measured and show that the temperature profile becomes less symmetrical with increasing air and fuel flow. The measurement values for the gas generator inlet temperature have been consolidated into a single value that is about 50 degrees different from expected values. The temperature profile at the power turbine inlet shows how the hot spot at the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> inlet is affected by the swirl produced by the power turbine stages. The time resolved fluctuations in pressure between the compressor and <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> have been measured and show that compressor discharge and <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> inlet pressures are similar.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that in certain {{emergency}} situations it may be desirable to obtain power from a helicopter engine at levels greater than the maximum rating.

The present investigation is concerned with the results of a feasibility study which analytically investigated the maximum possible level of augmentation with constant <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> stress rupture life as a constraint.

40|$|Because {{of their}} {{superior}} high-temperature properties, <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> airfoils made of single-crystal, nickel-base superalloys are fast becoming the standard equipment on today's advanced, high-performance aerospace engines.

However, the previously developed methodologies for life-prediction models are based on experience with polycrystalline alloys and may not be applicable to single-crystal alloys under certain operating conditions. One of the main areas where behavior differences between single-crystal and polycrystalline alloys are readily apparent is subcritical fatigue crack growth (FCG).

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{performance evaluation}} {{was made of}} two movable sidewall variable area radial turbines. The turbine designs were representative of the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> of a variable flow capacity rotorcraft engine. The first turbine was an uncooled design while the second turbine had a cooled nozzle but an uncooled rotor. The cooled nozzle turbine was evaluated both with and without coolant flow.

Peak efficiencies of the second turbine with and without nozzle coolant were 86. 5 and 88 percent respectively. These values are comparable to pivoting vane variable geometry turbines; however, the decrease in efficiency as the flow was varied from the design value was much less for the movable wall turbine. Several design improvements which should increase the turbine efficiency one or two more points are identified.

40|$|For the {{development}} of a Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle (HLLV) several engines with different operating cycles and using LOX/Hydrocarbon propellants are presently being examined. Some concepts utilize hydrogen for thrust chamber wall cooling followed by a <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> drive cycle with subsequent dumping of H 2 /O 2 combustion products into the nozzle downstream of the throat. In the Space Transportation Booster Engine (STBE) selection process the specific impulse {{will be one of the}} optimization criteria; however, the current performance prediction programs do not have the capability to include a third propellant in this process, nor to account for the effect of dumping the gas-generator product tangentially inside the nozzle. The purpose is to describe a computer program for accurately predicting the performance of such an engine. The code consists of two modules; one for the inviscid performance, and the other for the viscous loss. For the first module, the two-dimensional kinetics program (TDK) was modified to account for tripropellant chemistry, and for the effect of tangential slot injection. For the viscous loss, the Mass Addition Boundary Layer program (MABL) was modified to include the effects of the boundary layer-shear layer interaction, and tripropellant chemistry. Calculations were made for a real engine and compared with available data...|$|E
40|$|TutorialTutorial 1 : The {{power and}} {{efficiency}} {{characteristics of a}} gas turbine {{are the result of}} a complex interaction of different turbo machines and a combustion system. In this tutorial, we will address the basic characteristics of each of the components in a gas turbine (compressor, <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine,</b> power turbine) and the impact of typical control limits and control concepts. The goal is to provide explanations for the operational characteristics of typical industrial gas turbines, emphasizing the interaction between the gas turbine components. The concept of component matching is explained. Additionally, methods are introduced that allow the use of data for trending and comparison purposes. The impact of component degradation on individual component performance, as well as overall engine performance is discussed, together with strategies to reduce the impact of degradation. In particular, the following topics will be discussed: The gas turbine as a system, Thermodynamics and aerodynamics, Component matching, Off-design behavior of gas turbines, Low fuel gas pressure, Accessory loads, Single-shaft versus two-shaft engines, Variable inlet and stator vanes, Control temperature, Transient behavior, Thermo dynamical parameters of exhaust gases.

V. Casey, “Accounting for losses” (2007), and using Bridgman’s partial differentials, the model uniquely describes the properties of a gas turbine solely by reference to the properties of the gas mixture passing through the engine. Turbine cooling is modelled using a method put forward by Kurzke. Turboshaft, turboprop, separate exhaust turbofan and turbojet engines may be modelled. Where applicable, optimisation of the power turbine and exhaust nozzle work split for flight conditions and component performances is automatically undertaken. The model is implemented via a VB. net code, which calculates thermodynamic states and controls the NASA CEA code for the calculation of thermodynamic properties at those states.

40|$|Gas {{turbine engines}} for military/commercial {{fixed-wing}} and rotary wing aircraft use thermal barrier coatings in the high-temperature {{sections of the}} engine for improved efficiency and power. The desire to further make improvements in gas turbine engine efficiency and high power-density is driving {{the research and development}} of thermal barrier coatings and the effort of improving their tolerance to fine foreign particulates that may be contained in the intake air. Both commercial and military aircraft engines often are required to operate over sandy regions such as in the Middle-East nations, as well as over volcanic zones. For rotorcraft gas turbine engines, the sand ingestion is adverse during take-off, hovering near ground, and landing conditions. Although, most of the rotorcraft gas turbine engines are fitted with inlet particle separators, they are not 100 percent efficient in filtering fine sand particles of size 75 microns or below. The presence of these fine solid particles in the working fluid medium has an adverse effect on the durability of turbine blade thermal barrier coatings and overall performance of the engine. Typical turbine blade damages include blade coating wear, sand glazing, Calcia-Magnesia-Alumina-Silicate (CMAS) attack, oxidation, plugged cooling holes, all of which can cause rapid performance deterioration including loss of aircraft. The objective of this research is to understand the fine particle interactions with typical ceramic coatings of turbine blades at the microstructure level. A finite-element based microstructure modeling and analysis has been performed to investigate particle-surface interactions, and restitution characteristics. Experimentally, a set of tailored thermal barrier coatings and surface treatments were down-selected through hot burner rig tests and then applied to first stage nozzle vanes of the <b>Gas</b> <b>Generator</b> <b>Turbine</b> of a typical rotorcraft gas turbine engine. Laser Doppler velocity measurements were performed during hot burner rig testing to determine sand particle incoming velocities and their rebound characteristics upon impact on coated material targets. Further, engine sand ingestion tests were carried out to test the CMAS tolerance of the coated nozzle vanes. The findings from this on-going collaborative research to develop the next-gen sand tolerant coatings for turbine blades are presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|In July 2001, Ingersoll-Rand {{began work}} on this program. Its {{objective}} was to introduce ceramic hot section components into the IR family of microturbines to permit higher operating temperatures and hence improved efficiency. The IR microturbine product line combines a novel application of industrial turbocharger equipment, our commercially successful recuperator, and proven industrial gas turbine design practices. The objective of the joint development program is to combine the high production success of the Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 } turbocharger rotors, largely from Japan, with the IR turbocharger-based microturbines. The IR 'Ceramic Microturbine' (CMT) program has been configured to use the most practical ceramic rotor, considering size, geometry, proven manufacturing methods, and physical material limitations Performance predictions indicate that 36 % LHV electric conversion efficiency could be attained at a Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT) of nominally 1000 C. The initial 72 kW engine is being designed to have comparable life and costs to our current product The package power rating is expandable to 100 kW with this equipment by slightly increasing pressure ratio flow and TIT. This program was initially planned as five major tasks In Task 1 a comprehensive analysis {{of the state of}} the art ceramics and their applicability to microturbines was performed Milestone I was achieved with the joint DoE/IR decision to concentrate on our 70 kW microturbine, with elevated turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio,. This preserved the ability of the engine to utilize the standard IR recuperator and the majority of the microturbine subassemblies, A commercialization report, projecting the market size, was also completed as part of this task. Task 2 's detailed design of the special hot-section components has been completed,. The two critical milestones, No. 3 and No. 4, associated with the detailed design of the monolithic silicon nitride turbine rotor and the release of the purchase order for this critical component were accomplished in Task 2.
