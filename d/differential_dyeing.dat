40|$|Wool fabrics {{were treated}} by {{ultraviolet}} radiations, using a medium pressure Hg lamp, {{in order to}} obtain a strong modification onto fibers surface. [1, 2, 3] As consequence, UV treated wool showed a decrease of water contact angle, then an increase of hydrophilicity, together with a better kinetics of dye absorption under the same conditions of dyeing, obtaining a dye-bath exhaustion nearly complete. The interaction between the metal cation and new ligand groups formed on irradiated wool (such as cystine oxides and cysteic acid) is responsible for the significantly increased depth of shade with 1 :l metal-complex dyes. In support of this hypothesis, UV-C-treated wool soaked in solutions of various transition metal salts (namely Mohr's salt, copper sulphate and silver nitrate) at room temperature gave a grey/brown colour in the irradiated regions, denouncing the increased affinity. Experimental results showed that different kind of dyes are able to give <b>differential</b> <b>dyeing</b> after irradiation, but not all members of the same dyeing class have similar behavior. Then, a selection of 1 : 1 metal-complex dyes was chosen to evidence the maximum of colour difference between irradiated and not irradiated areas.

The extent to which cellular RNA is a substrate for oxidative damage and the possible biological consequences of RNA base oxidation, however, remain largely unexplored. Since oxidatively modified RNA {{may contribute to the}} high mutability of retroviral genomic DNA, we have been interested in developing methods for the sequence specific detection of such damage. We show here that a primer extension assay using AMV reverse transcriptase (RT) can be used to reveal oxidatively damaged sites in RNA. This finding extends the currently known range of RNA modifications detectable with AMV reverse transcriptase. Analogous assays using DNA polymerases to detect base damage in DNA substrates appear to be restricted to lesions at thymine. Oxidative base damage {{in the absence of any}} detectable chain breaks was produced by dye photosensitization of RNA. Six out of 20 dyes examined were capable of producing RT detectable lesions.

Often mechanical ventilation is required as supportive treatment; however, ventilation can also induce lung injury and apoptosis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effects of three modes of controlled mechanical ventilation: volume control, pressure control, and pressure regulated volume control on lung injury as measured by hydrogen peroxide and apoptosis during hemorrhagic shock. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to the three controlled mechanical ventilation groups. Hemorrhagic shock was elicited by removing approximately 40 % of the blood volume over 30 minutes. The rats were treated with one of three modes of mechanical ventilation with 40 % oxygen for 60 minutes. The lungs were removed and measured for hydrogen peroxide and apoptosis based on nuclear <b>differential</b> <b>dye</b> uptake. There were no significant differences in hemodynamics, arterial blood values, peak inspiratory pressures, tidal volume, respiratory rates, and intrathoracic pressures across three groups. However, lung hydrogen peroxide production and apoptosis were significantly increased in volume control and pressure control, compared to pressure-regulated volume control. In this study, early signs of ventilator induced lung injury were not detected using commonly employed clinical measurements. However, when examining lung cellular injury (hydrogen peroxide and apoptosis), we were able to measure significant lung damage in volume control and pressure control, but not pressure-regulated volume control. Thus, our results suggest that pressure-regulated volume control is the preferable mode of mechanical ventilation during hemorrhagic shock. </b...|$|R

Neste trabalho, amidos de batata, batata doce, {{mandioca}}, mandioquinha salsa, milho e milho ceroso foram modificados com KMnO 4 /ácido lático e NaOCl/ácido lático e caracterizados quanto ao teor de carboxilas, poder redutor, coloração diferencial, propriedade de expansão e propriedades viscoamilográficas, em água e tampões acetato (pH 4, 0) e fosfato (pH 7, 0). Amidos de milho ceroso e de mandioca modificados com KMnO 4 /ácido lático apresentaram elevadas expansões (25, 8 e 24, 1 mL. g- 1, respectivamente). As pastas de amido de milho ceroso resistiram a ciclos de congelamento/descongelamento. A coloração diferencial e o teor de carboxilas não permitiram diferenciar as amostras; apenas o amido de batata reagiu com azul de metileno devido aos grupos fosfato. Quanto ao pH e acidez, as amostras apresentaram valores próximos da neutralidade, exceto o amido de milho e milho ceroso modificados com NaOCl.

40|$|Of {{the several}} {{biochemical}} tests {{which have been}} utilized for speciation within the genus BruceUa, the "urea test " is one {{for which there is}} considerable contradiction in the literature. More specifically, there have been conflicting reports concerning the relative urease activity of Brucella melitensis, whereas there appears to be general agreement that Brucela sui 8 rapidly hydrolyzes urea and that Brucella abortue hydro-lyzes urea very slowly. Our brief observations on this test and its correlation with the <b>differential</b> <b>dye</b> pattern (Pickett et al., 1952) led us to suspect that it should be a reliable means for distinguish-ing B. suis from the other two species. Further examination of the urea test has confirmed our original impresion that it is a distinctly valuable tool for characterizing the species within this genus. This conclusion implies, however, that the test be conducted only (1) with frankly smooth strains, as established by careful examination of colonial morphology and by nonagglutinability in acrifiavine, (2) with a well buffered, peptone-free, urea medium, e. g., the medium of Rustigian and Stuart (1941) but not that of Christensen (1946) or Ferguson and Hook (1943), and (3) with a carefully standardized inoculum. Our observations during this study have dis-closed an urgent need for reevaluation and standardization of methods for speciation within this genus. Accordingly, we have examined several tests, in addition to urea, and have attempted to evaluate their relative merits for the identifica-tion of brucellae.

The effects of ROS [mimicked by hydrogen peroxide(H 2 O 2) ] on NO-mediated cellular death were examined in this study. Method: Human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa) was grown using Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM).

Much research has been done on the evaluation of cotton abrasion tests, but little has been done on the comparison of these evaluations to find the most suitable methods for particular fabrics, fibers and testing machines. The purpose of this study was to abrade cotton fabric in the Accelerotor, to evaluate the abrasion damage of the fabric after abrasion, and to compare the evaluation methods investigated to find those most suitable to use for cotton abraded in the Accelerotor. A sampling plan was developed to cut twelve specimens of cotton fabric from each of six areas of the cloth. The specimens within the areas were randomly chosen. Five specimens from each area were abraded with the grit liner in the Accelerotor at time intervals of one, two, three, seven, and fifteen minutes. Four specimens from each area were abraded with the friction liner at one, three, ten, and thirty minutes. Two specimens from each area were held for replacement and one was left unabraded. The Accelerotor was run at constant speed. Physical, visual, and dyeing tests were used to evaluate the degree of abrasion received by the fabric. The methods used were weight of the whole specimen;weight per square yard of the fabric; breaking strength; yarn count; visual ratings of the fabric, yarn, and fiber; and congo red and <b>differential</b> <b>dyeing</b> tests. The results of these tests were compared to find those most suitable to evaluate cotton fabric abraded in the Accelerotor.

The advancement of such a knowledge has encountered challenges and limitations associated with conventional culture-based and PCR techniques.

Here, we describe FCM technique coupled with live/dead <b>differential</b> staining <b>dyes</b> SYBR Green I (SGI) and Propidium Iodide (PI) to quantify and study other essential characteristics of the mosquito gut microbiota. Results: A clear discrimination between cells and debris, as well as between live and dead cells was achieved when the midgut homogenate was subjected to staining with 5 x 103 dilution of the SGI and 30 mu M concentration of the PI. Reproducibly, FCM event collections produced discrete populations including non-fluorescent cells, SYBR positive cells, PI fluorescing cells and cells that fluoresce both in SYBR and PI, all these cell populations representing, respectively, background noise, live bacterial, dead cells and inactive cells with partial permeability to PI. The FCM produced a strong linear relationship between cell counts and their corresponding dilution factors (R- 2 = 0. 987), and the technique has a better precision compared to qRT-PCR. The FCM count of the microbiota reached a peak load at 18 h post-feeding and started declining at 24 h.

We aimed to identify and characterise novel antibodies specific to ovarian epithelial TSCs, particularly towards populations with Hoechst efflux (Side Population, SP) and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity which are associated with a stem cell phenotype and drug resistance. Putative TSC subpopulations from ovarian tumour cell lines isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using <b>differential</b> Hoechst <b>dye</b> uptake and Aldefluor activity assays displayed stem cell-like characteristics, including the upregulation of stem cell markers, increased anchorage-independent growth and increased invasive properties.

The 2 mAbs demonstrated cross-reactivity on human embryonic stem cells but no cross-reactivity to normal ovarian cell lines. Subpopulations of ovarian cell lines positive for the mAbs displayed stem cell-like characteristics, including upregulation of stem cell markers - CD 133, ABCB 1 and ALDH 1 A 1. Sorted mAb populations were injected into non-obese diabetic/severe combined (NOD/SCID) mice and differential in vivo tumour formation was observed. Finally, the target antigen which both mAbs recognised was identified by mass spectrometry to be clathrin heavy chain (CHC 1). We conclude that rare subpopulations with tumour-sustaining capability and stem cell-like characteristics can be identified in ovarian cancer using the 2 novel antibodies generated.

For Azospirillum irakense KBC 1, the variant was not stable and coincided {{with the formation of}} a new replicon whereas the revertant recovered the parental genomic architecture. This study shows large-scale genomic rearrangements in Azospirillum strains and correlates them with phase variation...|$|R
40|$|Securinine, a GABA(A) {{receptor}} antagonist, {{has been}} reported to enhance monocyte cell killing of Coxiella burnetii without obvious adverse effects in vivo. We employed multiplex 2 D gel electrophoresis using Zdyes, a new generation of covalently linked fluorescent <b>differential</b> protein detection <b>dyes</b> to analyze changes in the monocyte proteome in response to Securinine. Securinine antagonism of GABA(A) receptors triggers the activation of p 38. We used the differential protein expression results to guide a search of the literature and network analysis software to construct a systems biology model of the effect of Securinine on monocytes. The model suggests that various metabolic modulators (fatty acid binding protein 5, inosine 5 '-monophosphate dehydrogenase, and thioredoxin) are at least partially reshaping the metabolic landscape within the monocytes. The actin bundling protein L-plastin, and the Ca(2 +) binding protein S 100 A 4 also appear to have important roles in the immune response stimulated by Securinine. Fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP 5) may be involved in effecting lipid raft composition, inflammation, and hormonal regulation of monocytes, and the model suggests that FABP 5 may be a central regulator of metabolism in activated monocytes. The model also suggests that the heat shock proteins {{have a significant impact on}} the monocyte immune response. The model provides a framework to guide future investigations into the mechanisms of Securinine action and with elaboration may help guide development of new types of immune adjuvants...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{technical}} limitations make <b>differential</b> staining with <b>dyes</b> such as Alcian blue and Safranin O unsatisfactory {{as the primary}} method for assessing the maturity of connective tissue mast cells in rodents. We demonstrated {{for the first time}} that in the steady state, most serosal mast cells in normal rats express a high-molecular-weight isoform of CD 45 that reacts with monoclonal antibody OX 33 (OX 33 +) and has been reported previously only on B cells. However, a small proportion did not express this isoform (OX 33 −) and this subset predominated during the early stages of mast cell regeneration in the peritoneal cavity. Furthermore, there was a progressive increase in the proportion of donor-derived OX 33 + cells after intraperitoneal adoptive transfer of purified OX 33 − mast cells to CD 45 congenic recipients. These results indicate that serosal mast cells up-regulate expression of the OX 33 -reactive CD 45 isoform(s) as they mature. Interestingly, acquisition of OX 33 -reactive CD 45 did not correlate temporally with sulphation of glycosaminglycan in the mast cell granules. Expression of this isoform was used also to assess the maturity of connective tissue mast cells during mastocytosis in synovium associated with T-cell-mediated experimental polyarthritis. Together, our results demonstrate that OX 33 -reactive CD 45 is a marker that can be used to assess the maturity of serosal and connective tissue mast cells during normal homeostasis and during pathological processes. The significance of differential expression of CD 45 isoforms may be to regulate the sensitivity of maturing mast cells to the actions of growth factors and activating stimuli...|$|R
