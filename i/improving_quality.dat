5|$|Chemotherapy may be {{combined}} with palliative care {{in the treatment of}} the NSCLC. In advanced cases, appropriate chemotherapy improves average survival over supportive care alone, as well as <b>improving</b> <b>quality</b> of life. With adequate physical fitness maintaining chemotherapy during lung cancer palliation offers 1.5 to 3 months of prolongation of survival, symptomatic relief, and an improvement in quality of life, with better results seen with modern agents. The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient wants and can tolerate treatment, then chemotherapy should be considered in advanced NSCLC.|$|E
5|$|Palliative care is {{specialized}} {{medical care}} for people with serious illnesses, including Parkinson's. The goal of this speciality is to improve {{quality of life for}} both the person suffering from Parkinson's and the family by providing relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of illnesses. As Parkinson's is not a curable disease, all treatments are focused on slowing decline and <b>improving</b> <b>quality</b> of life, and are therefore palliative in nature.|$|E
5|$|Both {{medications}} and neurorehabilitation {{have been shown}} to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed. For neurologic problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for <b>improving</b> <b>quality</b> of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different points in time. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level. There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.|$|E

5|$|Obama {{called for}} Congress to pass {{legislation}} reforming {{health care in the}} United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and <b>improving</b> <b>quality</b> of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.|$|E
5|$|The battleships of {{the late}} 1880s, for {{instance}} the , were armoured with iron and steel compound armour. This was soon replaced with more effective case-hardened steel armour made using the Harvey process developed in the United States. First tested in 1891, Harvey armour was commonplace in ships laid down from 1893–1895. However, its reign was brief; in 1895, the German Kaiser Friedrich III pioneered the superior Krupp armour. Europe adopted Krupp plate within five years, and only the United States persisted in using Harvey steel into the 20th century. The <b>improving</b> <b>quality</b> of armour plate meant that new ships could have better protection from a thinner and lighter armour belt; 12inches (305mm) of compound armour provided the same protection as just 7.5inches (190mm) of Harvey or 5.75inches (133mm) of Krupp.|$|E

From June–August 1950, Deming trained hundreds of engineers, managers, and scholars in statistical process control (SPC) and concepts of quality. He also conducted at least one session for top management (including top Japanese industrialists of the likes of Akio Morita, the cofounder of Sony Corp.) Deming's message to Japan's chief executives was that <b>improving</b> <b>quality</b> would reduce expenses while increasing productivity and market share. Perhaps the best known of these management lectures was delivered at the Mt. Hakone Conference Center in August 1950.|$|E
25|$|Palliative care is {{medical care}} {{which focuses on}} {{treatment}} of symptoms of serious illness, like cancer, and <b>improving</b> <b>quality</b> of life. One {{of the goals of}} treatment in palliative care is symptom control rather than a cure of the underlying cancer. Pain is common in metastatic prostate cancer, and cancer pain related to bone metastases can be treated with bisphosphonates, medications such as opioids, and palliative radiation therapy to known metastases. Spinal cord compression can occur with metastases to the spine and can be treated with steroids, surgery, or radiation therapy. Other symptoms that can be addressed through palliative care include fatigue, delirium, lymphedema in the scrotum or penis, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.|$|E
25|$|Treatments {{used for}} {{colorectal}} cancer may include {{some combination of}} surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within {{the wall of the}} colon may be curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely are usually not curable, with management being directed towards <b>improving</b> <b>quality</b> of life and symptoms. Five year survival rates in the United States are around 65%. This, however, depends on how advanced the cancer is, whether or not all the cancer can be removed with surgery, and the person's overall health. Globally, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer making up about 10% of all cases. In 2012, there were 1.4 million new cases and 694,000 deaths from the disease. It is more common in developed countries, where more than 65% of cases are found. It is less common in women than men.|$|E

25|$|The {{balance of}} {{benefits}} versus harms {{of breast cancer}} screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening does more good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene {{may be used in}} an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with cancer, a number of treatments may be used, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and targeted therapy. Types of surgery vary from breast-conserving surgery to mastectomy. Breast reconstruction may take place at the time of surgery or at a later date. In those in whom the cancer has spread {{to other parts of the}} body, treatments are mostly aimed at <b>improving</b> <b>quality</b> of life and comfort.|$|E
