40|$|Based on the Goal-Plans-Action model (Dillard, 1990, 2004), this {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} interaction goals, thoughts, and cognitive effort influence <b>advice</b> <b>message</b> production in an upward influence context. Study I (N= 140) investigates upward influence goal structure and cognitive responses that employees generate when {{they attempt to}} advise their supervisor {{on how to improve}} work. Building on the findings of Study I, Study II (N= 212) distinguishes relatively low and high thoughtfulness in message production and tests whether the amount of cognitive elaboration affects <b>advice</b> <b>message</b> qualities. Results from both studies show that heightened degree of primary goal importance (problem-comprehension and/or problem-solving goals) is associated with a greater number of anticipatory thoughts (caution thoughts), greater cognitive effort in deciding how to give advice to one 2 ̆ 7 s boss, and <b>advice</b> <b>messages</b> that contain a larger number and more diverse set of reasons. Cognitive effort and caution thoughts also mediate the impact of primary goals on the degree of reasoning present in <b>advice</b> <b>messages.</b> In addition, results from Study II also provide initial evidence of how a message production process may vary depending on people 2 ̆ 7 s cognitive elaboration. It is found that when people have less motivation to elaborate (i. e., engage in issue relevant thinking about information in a hypothetical advice scenario), they rely only on a few salient goals or thoughts in generating messages. In contrast, when people are in a high elaboration state of mind, they activate an array of thoughts and goals with each of these factors playing a distinct role in predicting message features. Having said this, the basic set of causal relations, outlined in the GPA model, including the mediating role of cognitive effort and caution thoughts, appear to operate similarly in both high and low elaboration conditions. Theoretical implications for extending the GPA model and practical implications for improving upward influence practice are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Eco-driving {{campaigns have}} {{traditionally}} assumed that drivers lack the necessary {{knowledge and skills}} {{and that this is}} something that needs rectifying. Therefore, many support systems have been designed to closely guide drivers and fine-tune their proficiency. However, research suggests that drivers already possess a substantial amount of the necessary knowledge and skills regarding eco-driving. In previous studies, participants used these effectively when they were explicitly asked to drive fuel-efficiently. In contrast, they used their safe driving skills when they were instructed to drive as they would normally. Hence, it is assumed that many drivers choose not to engage purpose fully in eco-driving in their everyday lives. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of simple, periodic text messages (nine messages in 2 weeks) on drivers’ eco- and safe driving performance. It was hypothesised that provision of eco-driving primes and advice would encourage the activation of their eco-driving mental models and that comparable safety primes increase driving safety. For this purpose, a driving simulator experiment was conducted. All participants performed a pre-test drive and were then randomly divided into four groups, which received different interventions. For a period of 2 weeks, one group received text messages with eco-driving primes and another group received safety primes. A third group received <b>advice</b> <b>messages</b> on how to eco-drive. The fourth group were instructed by the experimenter to drive fuel-efficiently, immediately before driving, with no text message intervention. A post- test drive measured behavioural changes in scenarios deemed relevant to eco- and safe driving. The results suggest that the eco-driving prime and <b>advice</b> text <b>messages</b> did not have the desired effect. In comparison, asking drivers to drive fuel-efficiently led to eco-driving behaviours. These outcomes demonstrate the difficulty in changing ingrained habits. Future research is needed to strengthen such messages or activate existing knowledge and skills in other ways, so driver behaviour can be changed in cost-efficient ways...|$|R

Protection motivation theory (PMT) provides a framework for understanding how people respond to health threats such as pandemics. The main {{aim of this study}} was to model the relative contribution of the components of PMT (threat and coping appraisal) to intentions to perform two behaviours recommended by the UK government in a pandemic: stay at home when ill and keep going to work when well. Design.  A 2 × 2 factorial design was used to test the effect of scenarios describing pandemic severity (low vs. high threat) and <b>advice</b> <b>messages</b> (standard government <b>advice</b> vs. theory-based advice) on measures of threat and coping appraisal, and intentions to carry out the two recommended behaviours. Methods.  A web-based survey designed to assess threat appraisal, coping appraisal, and behavioural intentions was completed by 883 adults (December 2009 –January 2010) drawn from University College London staff and the local community. Structural equation modelling was used to test the PMT framework. Results.  Perceived pandemic severity influenced threat and coping appraisals and intentions. Structural equation modelling revealed that coping appraisal (i. e., perceptions of the costs, benefits, and feasibility of the recommended behaviours) was the principal predictor of variability in intentions for both behaviours and for both pandemic scenarios. Conclusions.  Coping appraisals appear to be an important, and hitherto underresearched, predictor of how people may behave in pandemics, and our findings provide encouraging preliminary evidence that it may be possible to change these perceptions...|$|R

No participant mentioned hearing about the benefits of fish consumption. More frequent exposure to public health messages during pregnancy was associated with lower reported consumption. Bermudian born women were less likely to reduce consumption of large fish species during pregnancy.

40|$|Purpose: To {{learn more}} about the nature of mother-adolescent discussions about {{sexuality}} and their influence on adolescents' behaviors and attitudes in Latino families. Methods: Fifty-five Latino mothers and their midadolescent children (35 girls, 20 boys, mean age 13 years) were observed talking about dating and sexuality. The videotaped conversations were coded for the prevalence of five maternal message types: beliefs and values, <b>advice,</b> cautionary <b>messages,</b> comments about the adolescents' everyday experiences, and maternal self-disclosure about her own dating and sexuality experiences. A structural equation model was used to examined how time spent on the various message types was related to three adolescent-related outcomes collected about 1 year later: sexual behavior, attitudes toward premarital sex, and reports of openness in the mother-child relationship. Results: Latino mothers focused the conversation on their personal beliefs and values about dating and sexuality. Discussions about beliefs and values were accompanied by more parental <b>advice</b> and cautionary <b>messages.</b> More maternal self-disclosure about personal dating and sexuality experiences was related to the adolescents' reporting a better functioning relationship with their mothers and having more conservative attitudes toward premarital sex. Sexuality communication was both positively and negatively related to adolescent sexual behavior, but the messages were not the same.

Study 1 examined the nature and relative influence of a set of stylistic, source, and content features of advice on responses to advice. 319 Chinese college students and 262 American college students filled out surveys that asked them to report on their recalled responses to a piece of advice they actually received. Data from Study 1 demonstrated that the selected stylistic, source, and content characteristics of advice had varying degrees of impact on American and Chinese reactions to advice. ^ Study 2 assessed whether explicit articulations of response efficacy, feasibility, absence of limitations, and facework were effective strategies of advice giving in supportive interactions. 227 Chinese college students and 248 American college students read and responded to a hypothetical scenario in which they received advice from a friend. The findings of Study 2 demonstrated that, for Chinese and Americans, advice was more effective When advice givers outlined the efficacy of the advised action, explained the feasibility of undertaking the advised action, addressed the potential limitations of the advised action, and employed politeness strategies when giving advice. ^ Study 3 tested an integrated model of advice giving, which specifies three sequential moves in supportive interactions involving advice: emotional support—problem inquiry and analysis—advice. 220 Chinese college students and 431 American college students read and responded to a hypothetical scenario in which they encountered a problem and received advice from a friend.

40|$|Abstract Background In Laos, small {{backyard}} poultry systems predominate (90 %). The first lethal human {{cases of}} highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) occurred in 2007. Few studies {{have addressed the}} impact of outbreaks and education campaigns on a smallholder producer system. We evaluated awareness and behaviours related to educational campaigns and the 2007 HPAI outbreaks. Methods During a national 2 -stage cross-sectional randomised survey we interviewed 1098 households using a pre-tested questionnaire in five provinces representative of the Southern to Northern strata of Laos. We used multivariate analysis (Stata, version 8; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) to analyse factors affecting recollection of HPAI educational messages, awareness of HPAI, and behaviour change. Results Of the 1098 participants, 303 (27. 6 %) received training on HPAI. The level of awareness {{was similar to that}} in 2006. The urban population considered risk to be decreased, yet unsafe behaviours persisted or increased. This contrasted with an increase in awareness and safe behaviour practices in rural areas. Reported behaviour changes in rural areas included higher rates of cessation of poultry consumption and dead poultry burial when compared to 2006. No participants reported poultry deaths to the authorities. Overall, 70 % could recall an educational message but the content and accuracy differed widely depending on training exposure. Washing hands and other hygiene <b>advice,</b> <b>messages</b> given during the HPAI educational campaign, were not recalled. Trained persons were able to recall only one message while untrained participants recalled a broader range of messages. Factors associated with an awareness of a threat of AI in Laos were: having received HPAI training, literacy level, access to TV, recent information, living in rural areas. Conclusion We report a paradoxical relationship between unsafe behaviours and risk perception in urban areas, as well as exposure to HPAI training and message misinterpretation. Future educational campaigns need to be tailored to specific target populations and farming styles, for example, small holder farms as compared to commercial farms. Special attention must be given to varying risk perceptions and the risk of misinterpretation of key messages, economic hardship, and real life consequences of reporting. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Unhealthy dietary and {{physical}} activity (PA) patterns are highly prevalent in most Western countries, especially among lower-educated and ethnic minority groups. Therefore, interventions to promote healthy eating {{and physical}} activity that can reach large numbers of lower-educated people are needed. When developing interventions, the ethnic diversity of the lower-educated population may {{be taken into account}} to make intervention material more appealing to the target group. This article describes the development and evaluation of two computer-tailored nutrition {{and physical activity}} interventions for lower-educated Dutch, Turkish and Moroccan women. One version is tailored to sociocognitive variables (traditional tailoring), while the other is additionally tailored to ethnic identity (EI-tailoring). Method Using intervention mapping, two evidence- and theory-based interventions were developed. In the traditional tailoring intervention, messages are tailored to health behavior, awareness of own behavior, attitude and self-efficacy. The behavior change techniques used to address these factors are: descriptive and evaluative feedback, arguments, modeling, goal setting, planning, barrier identification and advice {{on how to deal with}} barriers, stimulating resistance to social pressure, mobilization of social support (nontailored), active learning (nontailored) and iterative feedback. In the EI-tailoring intervention, the material is additionally tailored to ethnic identity (EI). This means that recipients who feel strongly attached to their ethnic background receive different intervention material than recipients with a weak attachment to their background. This includes, for instance, the use of more traditional colors, role models that match with their origin and <b>advice</b> <b>messages</b> that refer to their ethnicity of origin. Discussion Developing an intervention that matches the needs of this specific target population was challenging due to the little evidence regarding the determinants of their health behavior, as well as the behavioral change techniques that have not been tested among Turkish and Moroccan women in the Netherlands before. Based on previous research among this and other target populations we hypothesize, however, that the determinants and strategies we use will be suitable. A randomized controlled trial will show whether the interventions are effective among our specific target group and whether EI-tailoring is beneficial.

The Authors 2016 BACKGROUND: Despite numerous healthy eating campaigns, the prevalence of diets high in saturated fatty acids, sugar, and salt and low in fiber, fruit, and vegetables remains high. With more people than ever accessing the Internet, Web-based dietary assessment instruments have the potential to promote healthier dietary behaviors via personalized dietary advice. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to develop a dietary feedback system for the delivery of consistent personalized dietary advice in a multicenter study and to examine the impact of automating the advice system. METHODS: The development of the dietary feedback system included 4 components: (1) designing a system for categorizing nutritional intakes; (2) creating a method for prioritizing 3 nutrient-related goals for subsequent targeted dietary advice; (3) constructing decision tree algorithms linking data on nutritional intake to feedback messages; and (4) developing personal feedback reports. The system was used manually by researchers to provide personalized nutrition advice based on dietary assessment to 369 participants during the Food 4 Me randomized controlled trial, with an automated version developed on completion of the study. RESULTS: Saturated fatty acid, salt, and dietary fiber were most frequently selected as nutrient-related goals across the 7 centers. Average agreement between the manual and automated systems, in selecting 3 nutrient-related goals for personalized dietary advice across the centers, was highest for nutrient-related goals 1 and 2 and lower for goal 3, averaging at 92 %, 87 %, and 63 %, respectively. Complete agreement between the 2 systems for feedback <b>advice</b> <b>message</b> selection averaged at 87 % across the centers. CONCLUSIONS: The dietary feedback system was used to deliver personalized dietary advice within a multi-country study. Overall, there was good agreement between the manual and automated feedback systems, giving promise to the use of automated systems for personalizing dietary advice.

This classification, in turn, illuminates some problems which novice writers exhibit in "inventing " explanations and has some specific pedagogical implications. extbooks generally advise writers to include an explanation in so-Tcalled &dquo;negative messages&dquo; (traditionally as part of the &dquo;indirect plan&dquo;). Textbook authors advise that letters containing such bad news should be logical and courteous, and they include example letters which are designed to illustrate these qualities. Unfortunately, as Hagge (1989, p. 50) has recently observed about textbook discussions of politeness, &dquo;What these textbooks ignore is the real issue: how courtesy is linguis...|$|R
40|$|Current {{evidence}} {{confirms that}} {{young women who}} smoke or who have regular long-term exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) have {{an increased risk of}} developing premenopausal breast cancer. The aim of this research was to examine the responses of young women to health information about the links between active smoking and SHS exposure and breast cancer and obtain their <b>advice</b> about <b>messaging</b> approaches. Data were collected in focus groups with 46 women, divided in three age cohorts: 15 – 17, 18 – 19 and 20 – 24 and organized according to smoking status (smoking, non-smoking and mixed smoking status groups). The discussion questions were preceded by information about passive and active smoking and its associated breast cancer risk. The study findings show young women's interest in this risk factor for breast cancer. Three themes were drawn from the analysis: making sense of the information on smoking and breast cancer, personal susceptibility and tobacco exposure and suggestions for increasing awareness about tobacco exposure and breast cancer. There was general consensus on framing public awareness messages about this risk factor on ‘protecting others’ from breast cancer to catch smokers’ attention, providing young women with the facts and personal stories of breast cancer to help establish a personal connection with this information and overcome desensitization related to tobacco messages, and targeting all smokers who may place young women at risk. Cautions were also raised about the potential for stigmatization. Implications for raising awareness about this modifiable risk factor for breast cancer are discussed...|$|R
