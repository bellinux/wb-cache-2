40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} reconstructing a class of nonuniformly sampled bandlimited signals of which a special case occurs in, e. g., time-interleaved analog-to-digital con-verter (ADC) systems due to time-skew errors. To this end, we pro-pose a synthesis system composed of digital fractional delay fil-ters. The overall system (i. e., nonuniform sampling and the pro-posed synthesis system) {{can be viewed as}} a generalization of time-interleaved ADC systems to which the former reduces as a spe-cial case. Compared with existing reconstruction techniques, our method has major advantages from an implementation point of view. To be precise, 1) we can perform the reconstruction as well as desired (in a certain sense) by properly designing the digital fractional <b>delay</b> <b>filters,</b> and 2) if properly implemented, the frac-tional <b>delay</b> <b>filters</b> need not be redesigned in case the time skews are changed. The price to pay for these attractive features is that we need to use a slight oversampling. It should be stressed, how-ever, that the oversampling factor is less than two as compared with the Nyquist rate. The paper includes error and quantization noise analysis. The former is useful in the analysis of the quantization noise and when designing practical fractional <b>delay</b> <b>filters</b> approx-imating the ideal filters.

40|$|Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) is a {{multichannel}} audio reproduction method, of {{a considerable}} computational cost that renders an accurate spatial sound field using {{a large number}} of loudspeakers to emulate virtual sound sources. The moving of sound source locations can be improved by using fractional <b>delay</b> <b>filters,</b> and room reflections can be compensated by using an inverse filter bank that corrects the room effects at selected points within the listening area. However, both the fractional <b>delay</b> <b>filters</b> and the room compensation filters further increase the computational requirements of the WFS system. This paper analyzes the performance of a WFS system composed of 96 loudspeakers which integrates both strategies. In order to deal with the large computational complexity, we explore the use of a graphics processing unit (GPU) as a massive signal co-processor to increase the capabilities of the WFS system. The performance of the method as well as the benefits of the GPU acceleration are demonstrated by considering different sizes of room compensation <b>filters</b> and fractional <b>delay</b> <b>filters</b> of order 9. The results show that a 96 -speaker WFS system that is efficiently implemented on a state-of-art GPU can synthesize the movements of 94 sound sources in real time and, at the same time, can manage 9, 216 room compensation filters having more than 4, 000 coefficients each.
