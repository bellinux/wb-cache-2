We find the estimated long run elasticity only slightly more price elastic than the short run. We also find that the long run elasticity does not differ significantly between the two approaches. The reason for both results is that, since there is no alternative source of energy for these appliances, there are no substitution effects.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the introduction of}} <b>electric</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> in Victoria, British Columbia between the world wars. As of 1919, electric lighting had already replaced gas, but electric appliances were still uncommon. Expensive to buy and use, their diffusion was further retarded by poor household wiring standards and uneven service from the monopoly utility, the British Columbia Electric Railway Company (BCER). This firm at first showed little interest in developing the domestic market. However, problems with industrial and corporate customers showed that household customers provided more stable and reliable revenues. Simultaneously, time payments, standardized electrical outlets, and improved wiring standards made its service more attractive to Victoria's consumers. Even so, the BCER remained cautious in developing this market though, maintaining high rates and at first discouraging the spread of electric ranges, as these intensified peak demand. Overall, one does not find a patriarchal, manipulative corporation imposing appliances on Victorians. Consumers, women in particular, were more autonomous than most scholars suggest. Electrical capitalists trailed behind rather than led demand...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a methodology to assess the possibility of equipment damages in low voltage customers due to lightning surges. The main objective is to incorporate this methodology in a computation system that supports distribution companies to determine the possible causes of equipment damages claimed by customers and to decide whether the claims are to be reimbursed or not. The proposed methodology determines whether a specific customer could be affected by a lightning strike according to his/her location and to the lightning main parameters, by using data from a lightning detection system and from the specific equipment surge withstand capability. A specific study using ATP (Alternative Transients Program) was carried out to assess the propagation of lightning surges in electric power distribution systems and their impact over low voltage customers. On the other hand, the withstand capability of the main household appliances was determined by a series of tests carried out in the University’s power quality laboratory. The paper details the modeling used for simulation, such as network configuration, grounding points, and modelling of insulator flashover, distribution transformer, low voltage loads. It also presents some results regarding the evaluation of overvoltages in low voltage customers installations. A practical method is proposed for assessing the possibility of equipment damage and describes how the existing uncertainties were handled. Also, some issues regarding the withstand capability of <b>electric</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> to lightning surges are discussed and some results of the laboratory tests are presented...|$|E

40|$|The scaling {{paradigm}} {{known as}} Moore's Law, with the shrinking of transistors and their doubling on a chip every two years, {{is going to}} reach a painful end. Another less-known paradigm, the so-called Koomey's Law, stating that the computing efficiency doubles every 1. 57 years, poses other important challenges, since the efficiency of rechargeable energy sources is substantially constant, and any other evolution is based on device architecture only. How can we still increase the computational power/reduce the power consumption of our electronic environments? A first {{answer to this question}} comes from the quest for new functionalities. Within this aim, negative capacitance (NC) is becoming one of the most intriguing and studied phenomena since it can be exploited for reducing the aforementioned limiting effects in the downscaling of electronic devices. Here we report the evidence of negative capacitance in 80 nm thick ZnO thin films sputtered on Au interdigital electrodes (IDEs). Highly (002) -oriented ZnO thin films, with a fine-grained surface nanostructure and the desired chemical composition, are deposited at room temperature on different IDEs structures. Direct-current electrical measurements highlighted the semiconducting nature of ZnO (current density in the order of 1 × 10 − 3 A/cm 2). When turned into the alternating current regime (from 20 Hz to 2 MHz) the presence of NC values is observed in the low-frequency range (20 − 120 Hz). The loss of metal/semiconductor interface charge states under forward bias conditions, together with the presence of oxygen vacancies and piezoelectric/electrostriction effects, is believed to be at the basis of the observed negative behavior, suggesting that ZnO thin-film-based field-effect transistors can be a powerful instrument to go beyond the Boltzmann limit and the downscaling of integrated circuit elements required for the fabrication of portable and miniaturized electronic devices, especially for <b>electric</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> working in the low 50 Hz utility frequency...|$|E
40|$|Environmental factors {{probably}} play {{an important}} role in the etiology of Parkinson disease (PD). However, not many environmental factors have been identified for which unequivocal evidence is available for a relation with PD risk. The main focus of the research described in this thesis was on studying associations between occupational exposures and PD risk. A large case-control study was conducted, for which all patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2011 in five participating hospitals were invited. Two age and sex matched controls per patient were selected from individuals who visited the same hospital for a range of non-neurodegenerative neurological complaints. We observed a strong inverse association of cigarette smoking with PD risk. This is in correspondence with many previous studies. In addition, we applied a novel modeling approach and observed effect modification by time-since-cessation of tobacco smoking with a diminishing protective effect of total smoking after cessation of smoking. A systematic review of the literature published on PD and ever use of pesticides was performed and a significantly increased summary risk ratio of 1. 62 was found. We investigated the observed heterogeneity in study outcomes. The results were suggestive for an effect of method of exposure assessment: studies using job-title based exposure assignment resulted in higher risk estimates than studies using self-reported information on pesticide use. For the present case-control study, we tried to improve upon methods for exposure assessment by combining self-reported information, a job-exposure matrix (JEM), an exposure algorithm and a crop-exposure matrix. The results did not show statistically significant associations between occupational pesticide exposure and PD. However, elevated odds ratios in the higher exposure categories for insecticides, herbicides and fungicides were suggestive for a positive association as observed in the systematic review. Analyses on specific active ingredients revealed a significant association with historical exposure to the fungicide benomyl, which is no longer allowed to be applied in the Netherlands We performed the most comprehensive analyses to date on the association between electricity related exposures and PD. JEMs were used to estimate lifetime occupational exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields and electrical shocks. We also analyzed ever having worked in so-called ‘electrical jobs’, self-reported number of electrical shocks and use of selected <b>electric</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances.</b> No associations with PD were observed and together with the results of previous studies and the absence of any known plausible mechanism, this strongly suggests that no relation exists. Results of previous studies that investigated the associations between metals and organic solvents and PD risk were inconclusive. We estimated exposure to metals and chlorinated and aromatic solvents using JEMs. Although slightly elevated risk estimates for the highest exposure categories for aromatic solvents were observed, we did not observe statistically significant associations. As such, our results do not provide additional evidence for an increased risk of PD after exposure to metals or solvents. New epidemiological studies on occupational risk factors should focus on improving methods to classify exposure to specific pesticides, metals or solvents; both in terms of specification, quantification as well as timing of exposure...|$|E
