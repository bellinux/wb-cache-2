25|$|Weta can bite with {{powerful}} mandibles. Tree weta bites are painful but not particularly common. Weta can inflict painful scratches, {{with the potential}} of infection, but their defence displays consist of looking large and spiky, and they will retreat if given a chance. Tree weta arc their hind legs into the air in warning to foes, and then strike downwards, so the spines could scratch {{the eyes of a}} predator. Pegs or ridges {{at the base of the}} abdomen are struck by a patch of fine pegs at the base (inner surface) of the legs and this action makes a distinctive sound. These actions are also used in defence of a gallery by competing males. The female weta looks as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> stinger, but it is an ovipositor, which enables her to lay eggs inside rotting wood or mossy wood or soil. Some species of Hemiandrus have very short ovipositors, related perhaps to their burrowing into soil and laying their eggs in a special chamber at the end of the burrow.|$|E
25|$|Yaroslavna {{is alone}} {{worrying}} about why {{she has not}} heard from Igor and his companions (Yaroslavna's Arioso). She sings of her tearful nights and nightmares and reminisces about when she was happy with Igor by her side. The nurse brings in the young women who tell Yaroslavna of their abducted friend. They are reluctant at first to reveal the culprit but eventually name Galitsky and talk of {{how he and his}} drunken followers cause trouble around Putivl. Galitsky enters and the women run away. Yaroslavna questions him as to the truth of their story and he mocks her saying she should treat him as a guest in her house. She threatens him with what Igor will do on his return, but Galitsky replies that he can seize the throne whenever he wants. Yaroslavna accuses him of repeating the betrayal that he carried out against their father, but he replies that he was only joking and asks <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> lover now her husband is away. She threatens him with sending him back to their father. He replies that he will return the girl but will take another later and leaves. The council of boyars arrive to inform Yaroslavna that the Polovtsy under Khan Gzak are about to attack Putivl. Igor's army has been utterly destroyed and he has been wounded and captured with his son and brother. After a moment of faintness, Yaroslavna orders messengers sent to the city's allies, but the Boyars report that the roads are cut, some towns are in revolt and their princes will be captured. The Boyars say that they will organise the defence but Galitsky returns with his followers to demand that a new Prince be chosen. His retinue say it should be him as he is Yaroslavna's brother and Igor's brother-in-law. The boyars refuse. The argument is interrupted by the sight of flames and the sound of crying women. Some of the boyars flee; some join the battle, others guard the Princess. They call the attack God's judgment.|$|E
500|$|Billboard {{reviewed}} the song favorably, writing {{that it is}} [...] "a wonderfully refreshing release that smartly side-steps her tried-and-true balladry {{in favor of a}} credible foray into jeep-funk territory." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today wrote that [...] " [...] Babyface-produced My Heart Is Calling; [...] have a spiritual feel. [...] help maintain a thematic cohesiveness that most soundtracks lack these days." [...] Similarly, Elysa Gardner of Los Angeles Times also {{reviewed the}} song favorably, writing that [...] "Houston shows her soulful side with equal panache, even <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> tendency to overdo the obligatory vocal gymnastics at times." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1968, she {{was offered}} the role of Sally Bowles in the musical Cabaret. As Sheridan Morley later reported: [...] "At first she thought they were joking. She had never done a musical and she has an unusual croaky voice which sounds as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{permanent}} cold. So frightened was she of singing in public that she auditioned from the wings, leaving the pianists alone on stage". But when it opened at the Palace Theatre in February 1968, Frank Marcus, reviewing for Plays and Players, commented that: [...] "She sings well. The title song, in particular, is projected with great feeling." ...|$|E
2500|$|June and Ward {{sleep in}} twin beds {{and have a}} {{portable}} television set in their room. Now and then, she drives the family's Ford Fairlane <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> specific errand. Ward occasionally dries the dishes for her; at other times, she has to goad him to do minor chores or repairs around the house. June has occasional house help {{in the person of}} Minerva and in the later episodes a Mrs. Manners, who (according to Beaver) smells like gingerbread. June does not completely trust Ward's Uncle Billy because he fills her sons' heads with fancies of irresponsible living. She often places Ward in a position where he must [...] "explain" [...] or apologize for his uncle. She is happily married with never a suggestion otherwise on the show.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Claire’s open {{disdain for}} her sister, {{she has never}} told Agnes about Tobias’s affair. It is not clear if she does this out of love or out of spite. She keeps the affair a secret, almost as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> hidden weapon that she protects in case she may {{have to use it}} one day. When Agnes comes right out and asks Claire to confirm her suspicions about Tobias, Claire’s answer is, “Ya got me, Sis.” Shortly after this exchange, Agnes {{describes}} Claire in this way: “Claire could tell us so much if she cared to [...] [...] [...] Claire, who watches from the sidelines, has seen so very much, has seen us all so clearly [...] [...] [...] You were not named for nothing.” Claire is said to closely resemble Albee’s aunt Jane, an alcoholic and frequent visitor to the Albee home.|$|E
