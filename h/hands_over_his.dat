5|$|After the High Councillor's {{downfall}} and the regime's {{defeat in}} Metropolis, the Regime is dismantled {{and all of}} its accomplices are arrested. Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> counterpart and Sinestro to the Guardians of the Universe to stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart. The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, he might have done the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never has to learn what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever happens to him, causing him to go down the path of his counterpart, he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E
5|$|In late 1961, {{there were}} violent {{confrontations}} between NOI members and police in South Central Los Angeles, and numerous Muslims were arrested. They were acquitted, but tensions had been raised. Just after midnight on April27, 1962, two LAPD officers shoved and beat several Muslims outside Temple Number 27 without provocation. A large crowd of angry Muslims came outside from the mosque. The officers attempted to intimidate the crowd. One officer was disarmed by the crowd; his partner {{was shot in}} the elbow by a third officer. More than 70 backup officers arrived. They raided the mosque and randomly beat NOI members. Police officers shot seven Muslims, including William X Rogers, who was hit in the back and paralyzed for life, and Ronald Stokes, a Korean War veteran, who was shot from behind while raising his <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head to surrender, killing him.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, {{the team}} was not {{announced}} at the scheduled time due to the delay caused by the veto. Journalists deduced the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for many weeks, missing all the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as {{to the nature of}} his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship regarding Barnes's behaviour was deposited in the NSWCA library. It accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by cupping his <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes and showing dissent by implying that they were blind.|$|E
5|$|Tahna orders Kira {{at gunpoint}} {{to return to}} the station, {{intending}} to collapse the wormhole with an explosive device, because then Bajor will have no motivation to invite Federation presence on Bajoran territory, which he sees as a new occupation. Kira lurches the runabout to one side, causing Tahna to fall over and allowing her to pilot the ship through the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant; where she ejects the bomb causing it to explode harmlessly in space. However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira {{to return to the}} Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to understand why this {{was the right thing to}} do someday.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} American {{soldiers and}} Partisans fight the Germans. Sam is fatally wounded after being shot twice while carrying an unconscious Angelo and dies from his injuries. Bishop and Negron hold off the Germans while Stamps tries {{to move the}} villagers to safety, but they are too heavily outnumbered. Renata and Stamps are killed, and Bishop dies after successfully reviving Angelo. Negron, in the retreat, is {{shot in the back}} and is saved by the radio. After Angelo gives him the Head of the Primavera, Negron gives the boy his rosary and tells him to leave. Negron is spared by a disillusioned German officer who <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> own Luger and tells Negron to defend himself. American soldiers arrive and secure the village before evacuating the wounded Negron, the sole survivor of the German attack.|$|E

50|$|Coutts refused Pooley's {{offer to}} <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> {{holdings}} {{in exchange for}} a life annuity of £1,000. Eventually, in June 1842 Pooley was forced to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> holdings in the new town to his creditors' trustees. Apparently there was a gentlemen's agreement to pay him £5 a week. He fled to Boulogne and lived in poverty.|$|R
25|$|The {{day after}} the Battle of Peachtree Creek the 33rd Alabama lost its regimental commander, Colonel Samuel Adams, {{who had been with}} it from its inception. Walking along the front line early that morning {{inspecting}} his men, Adams was shot by a Federal sharpshooter; he sat down by a small oak tree with both <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> heart, and died there. Lieutenant Colonel Robert Crittenden took command of the regiment that day.|$|E
500|$|Beiderbecke's father, {{the son of}} German immigrants, was a well-to-do {{coal and}} lumber merchant, named after the Iron Chancellor of his native Germany. Beiderbecke's mother was the {{daughter}} of a Mississippi riverboat captain. She played the organ at Davenport's First Presbyterian Church, and encouraged young Bix's interest in the piano. Beiderbecke was the youngest of three children. His brother, Burnie, was born in 1895, and his sister, Mary Louise, in 1898. He began playing piano at age two or three. His sister recalls that he stood on the floor and played it with his <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head. Five years later, he was the subject of an admiring article in the Davenport Daily Democrat that proclaimed: [...] "Seven-year-old boy musical wonder! Little Bickie Beiderbecke plays any selection he hears." ...|$|E
500|$|Fitzsimmons went {{to court}} to {{overturn}} Earp's decision. Newspaper accounts and testimony {{over the next two}} weeks revealed a conspiracy among the boxing promoters to fix the fight's outcome. Newspapers across the United States republished the stories from the San Francisco papers and looked for local angles. On December 14, 1896, the San Francisco Call quoted a story from the New York Journal by Alfred H. Lewis, [...] "who knew the 'bad men' in Arizona. He said that the Earps in Tombstone were [...] "stage robbers" [...] who [...] "stood up stages and plundered express companies for a livelihood... The Earps, Wyatt, Virgil, Warren and Julian, had treated themselves to many a killing... Warren Earp, who was a stage-company guard, meekly put his <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head... it was from all standpoints a family affair {{on the part of the}} Earps. Often they got as high as $25,000... Virgil, as marshal, would enlist Wyatt, Warren and Julian, together with Curly Bill, their cousin, and hunt the hold-ups." [...] Earp was parodied in editorial cartoon caricatures by newspapers across the United States.|$|E

500|$|At {{a monastery}} in the Vatican, George covertly enters a wafer factory and finds Anna Maria's file in an office. After George is {{discovered}} {{and is being}} escorted outside by Cardinal Gianelli, Father Gregor tells him that Anna Maria used to here, but that she has stolen a manuscript, and he <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> business card. By showing the card to Mark, {{he is willing to}} help and gives George Anna Maria's package. From Mark, he learns about the Black Cat club. The package contains a DVD with an interview with a man called Maynard, who has managed to make [...] "monatomic gold". Nico leaves to Phoenix to check things out. George gains access to the Black Cat club, where he meets Duane (who he has met before in previous installments). Duane reveals that Spallaci owns the club. Afterwards, George is caught for stealing a towel and tied to a chair. Spallaci interrogates him about Anna Maria, and he overhears the recorded voice of Nico. Shots are being fired, so he thinks Nico has been killed. When he finds a way to escape, he goes for a drink, trying to forget the loss of Nico. The next day, still drunk, he arrives at Anna Maria's apartment, where Nico returns and George faints.|$|E
500|$|With {{the score}} 2–0 to Reading, the goalkeeper Steve Death {{threw the ball}} to the right back Gary Peters, who spotted Friday {{standing}} near the left-hand corner of the opposing penalty area. Peters passed high and diagonally across the pitch towards his forward, who jumped into the air and used his chest to cushion the ball and knock it into the air with his back to goal, about 25–30 yards away from the net. As Friday landed, he ferociously powered the ball towards goal, kicking over his shoulder and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the top-right-hand corner of the net, stunning the crowd, players and Thomas, the referee, who put his <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head in disbelief. [...] "I'll never forget it", Thomas recalled. [...] "It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder. ... If it hadn't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost. Even up against the likes of Pelé and Cruyff, that rates as the best goal I have ever seen." [...] Reading {{went on to win the}} game 5–0. When Thomas told Friday after the game that he had never seen a better goal, the Londoner replied, [...] "Really? You should come down here more often, I do that every week." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the May 2014 {{military}} coup, Pravit and {{a fellow}} journalist, Thanapol Eawsakul, were summoned by the military on 23 May 2014. Before answering the summons, Pravit told the Thai media, [...] "I hope people will not give up the spirit and that General Prayuth {{will be the last}} dictator of Thailand". He was said to have added: [...] "They can detain me, but can never detain my conscience". He thereupon taped his mouth shut and put his <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> ears. On the following day he went with a lawyer and representatives of the UN to the headquarters of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO). He was questioned for five hours without his lawyer being present and was then taken to an unidentified detention center.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Talmud, {{the reading}} of the Shema morning and evening fulfils the commandment [...] "You shall meditate therein day and night". As soon as a child begins to speak, his father is {{directed}} to teach him the verse [...] "Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob" [...] (Deut. 33:4), and teach him to read the Shema (Talmud, Sukkah 42a). The reciting of the first verse of the Shema is called [...] "the acceptance of the yoke of the kingship of God" [...] (kabalat ol malchut shamayim) (Mishnah Berachot 2:5). Judah ha-Nasi, who spent all day involved with his studies and teaching, said just the first verse of the Shema in the morning (Talmud Berachot 13b) [...] "as he passed his <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes" [...] which appears to be the origin of the Jewish custom to cover the eyes with the right hand whilst reciting the first verse.|$|E
