50|$|To {{conclude}} that all sex workers partake {{in the industry}} because of oppression, past sexual abuse, and lack of opportunity, creates a critical division in feminism and equality. Assuming that all women who chose to partake in sex work are victims of oppression, violates their ability to make an autonomous choice. The autonomy theory of feminism seeks to instill in women, the right to “stand on their own, make their own decisions, and pursue their own notion of a life lived well.” It cannot be ignored that some women freely chose to become sex workers not because of oppression, but because of their love for sex and desire for power. Sex work can also {{create a sense of}} independence for women. Rather than relying on a husband or a partner, sex work allows women to make choices completely <b>free</b> <b>from</b> <b>pressure</b> or influence. While women are socialized to hide their sexuality, sex workers are free to explore their sexuality and to openly choose their sexual partners. Sex workers; whether they work on the streets or in hotels have the freedom to accept or to reject clients. They are free to accept or to decline any sexual advance. This stands in direct opposition to the married housewife who does not have the sexual autonomy of the sex worker.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} approach {{based on}} the Lattice Boltzmann and Immersed Boundary methods is proposed to tackle {{the problem of the}} interaction of moving and/or deformable slender solids with an incompressible fluid flow. The method makes use of a Cartesian uniform lattice that encompasses both the fluid and the solid domains. The deforming/moving elements are tracked through a series of Lagrangian markers that are embedded in the computational domain. Differently from classical projection methods applied to advance in time the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, the baseline Lattice Boltzmann fluid solver is <b>free</b> <b>from</b> <b>pressure</b> corrector step, which is known to affect the accuracy of the boundary conditions. Also, in contrast to other immersed boundary methods proposed in the literature, the proposed algorithm does not require the introduction of any empirical parameter. In the case of rigid bodies, the position of the markers delimiting the surface of an object is updated by tracking both the position of the centre of mass of the object and its rotation using Newtonʼs laws and the conservation of angular momentum. The dynamics of a flexible slender structure is determined {{as a function of the}} forces exerted by the fluid, its flexural rigidity and the tension necessary to enforce the filament inextensibility. For both rigid and deformable bodies, the instantaneous no-slip and impermeability conditions on the solid boundary are imposed via external and localised body forces which are consistently introduced into the Lattice Boltzmann equation. The validation test-cases for rigid bodies include the case of an impulsively started plate and the sedimentation of particles under gravity in a fluid initially at rest.
