40|$|A {{methodology}} {{to predict}} gauge corner and <b>flange</b> <b>root</b> degradation {{in terms of}} rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and wear from measured rail, wheel and track geometries by so-called meta-models is presented. The methodology sets out from a parameterisation of the gauge corner and the <b>flange</b> <b>root</b> profiles. Statistics of measured rail and wheel profiles are then used to create scenarios, which are employed in multibody dynamics simulations with degradation quantified by RCF and wear indices. Finally regression analysis is employed to derive meta-models to predict whether contact will occur at the gauge corner and (when this is the case) quantify RCF and wear impact. Derived meta-models are used to rank measured profiles based on how detrimental they are. Robustness is assessed through comparisons for two different vehicles. The ability to rank measured profiles without computationally expensive simulations (including needs for additional presumptions that such simulations require) makes the study valuable e. g. for maintenance planning...|$|E
40|$|Microstructure, plastic {{deformation}} and annealing {{properties of the}} material in the outermost tread layer of used passenger railway wheels were characterised. Large deformation existed up to 5 mm depth below the surface and material flow, i. e. shear strain, was present both in tangential- and transverse directions of the wheel. Close to the field side and <b>flange</b> <b>root</b> moderate rolling contact fatigue was observed, where also the largest work hardening and shear deformation were measured. Annealing trials at temperatures around 500 degrees C showed softening of the deformed surface layer at lower temperatures and at higher rate than for non-deformed material...|$|E
40|$|For more {{efficient}} railway maintenance {{there is a}} need to increase the understanding of the influence of operational conditions on wheel and rail degradation. To this end, the chosen primary investigation strategy is to employ dynamic multibody simulations, where operational conditions are altered, to estimate the influence on material deterioration. Operational conditions considered are track, wheel and rail geometries; and types of material deterioration that are considered are rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and wear. Track geometry, especially the curve radius, has a large influence on wheel/rail degradation. Smaller curve radii lead to higher degradation. By also considering the influence of lateral track irregularities in curves, a more complicated relationship emerge. Large curve radii and a high level of lateral irregularities lead to an increase in RCF over the length of a curve. For small radius curves, where wear is the dominating damage mechanism, an increase in the level of lateral irregularities leads to a transition towards a mixed RCF/wear regime for the outer (high) rail. The influence of wheel and rail geometries on degradation is studied by parametrisation of wheel/rail geometries, employing a design of experiments scheme to the multibody simulations that determine degradation, and finally by deriving meta-models through regression analysis. The meta-models link estimated degradation magnitudes to key geometric parameters. The advantage of the meta-models is that degradation magnitudes can be evaluated with a very low computational cost. This has the benefit that measured wheel and rail profiles can be ranked based on how detrimental they are. Examples are presented for altered gauge corner and <b>flange</b> <b>root</b> geometries, and also for hollow worn wheels. A field study of RCF of locomotive wheels shows its strong dependence on operational conditions. Seasonal variations in the number of wheel reprofilings are explained in terms of seasonal variations in weather conditions, lubrication practices and rail grinding. </p...|$|E

Pupation occurs within the gallery.|$|R
40|$|A thermal tip {{clearance}} control system provides a robust and flexible means of manipulating the closure between the casing and the rotating blade tips in a jet engine, reducing undesirable tip leakage flows. This may be achieved using an impingement cooling scheme on the external casing of the engine in conjunction with careful thermal management of internal over-tip seal segment cavity. For a reduction in thrust specific fuel consumption, the mass flow rate of air used for cooling must be minimised, be at as low a pressure as possible and delivered through a light weight structure surrounding the rotating components in the turbine. This thesis first characterises {{the effectiveness of a}} range of external impingement cooling arrangements in typical engine casing closure system. The effects of jet-to-jet pitch, number of jets, inline and staggered alignment of jets, arrays of jets on flange, on an engine representative casing geometry are assessed through comparison of the convective heat transfer coefficient distributions in a series of numerical studies. A baseline case is validated experimentally. The validation data allowed the suitability of different turbulence closure models to be assessed using a commercial RANS solver. Importantly for each configuration the thermal contraction of an idealised engine casing is predicted using thermo-mechanical finite element models, at a series of operating conditions representing engine idle to maximum take-off conditions. Cooling is provided by manifolds attached to the outside of the engine. The assembly tolerance of these components leads to variation in the standoff distance between the manifold and the casing. For cooling arrangements with promising performance, the study is extended to characterise the variation in closure with standoff distance. It is shown that where a sparse array of non-interacting jets is used the system can be made tolerant of large build misalignments. The casing geometry itself contributes to the thermal response of the system, and, in an additional study, the effect of casing thickness and circumferential thermal control flanges are investigated. Restriction of the passage of heat into the flanges was seen to be dramatically change their effectiveness and slight necking of the <b>flanges</b> at their <b>root</b> was shown to improve the performance disproportionally. High temperature secondary air flowing past the internal face of the engine casing tends to heat the casing, causing it to grow. Experimental and numerical characterisation of a heat transfer within a typical over-tip segment cavity heat transfer is presented in this thesis for the first time. A simplified modelling strategy is proposed for casing and a means to reduce the casing heat pickup by up to 25 % was identified. The overall validity of the modelling approach used is difficult to validate in the engine environment, however limited data from a test engine temperature survey became available {{during the course of the}} research. By modelling this engine {{tip clearance}} control system it was shown that good agreement to the temperature distribution in the engine casing could be achieved where full surface external heat transfer coefficient boundary conditions were available. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{basic problem}} of this {{particular}} investigation {{was to determine the}} stress concentration factors present at a shoulder in the root section of a model propeller blade manufactured from 76 S-T aluminum alloy. The particular geometric section considered is found in the type propeller blades such as will be installed soon in the Southern California Cooperative Mind Tunnel, Pasadena, California. These blades were manufactured from forgings of 76 S-T by the Hamilton Standard Propeller Division of the United Aircraft Corporation. Stress concentration factors were determined for what will be called the "critical section" of the blade. This section is understood to mean the cross section of minimum area which is located immediately above the stress-raising fillet at the junction of the blade itself and the <b>root</b> <b>flange.</b> A secondary purpose of the investigation was to correlate these data with two other experiments that had already been carried out for this particular blade shape. These earlier experiments determined the magnitudes of surface stresses in the critical section, one utilizing a full-scale, three-dimensional model, and the other a two-dimensional full scale model one inch thick. Both of these experiments utilized static tension loads, the loads being applied over the upper surface of the flange, exactly as they are assumed to act when the blade is rotating in the wind tunnel. Also, an attempt was made to compare the data obtained in this investigation with other fatigue tests of a more general nature. The tests made in this present investigation were all of a fatigue nature, in which one-tenth scale models of the actual blade were used as fatigue specimens. Two types of loading were used. The first consisted of a cyclic loading between varying upper tension limits to zero stress, and the second consisted of a constant upper tension stress limit with varying minimum stresses. Tests were conducted using an upper tension nominal stress limit of approximately 28, 000 psi and were extended to tension stresses of lower values which gave a fatigue life of more than 15, 000, 000 cycles. Due to the slow rate of loading (2, 500, 000 per day) in the Sonntag Universal Fatigue Testing Machine, the investigation was not continued to the generally accepted value of 500, 000, 000 cycles which marks the upper cyclic limit of fatigue investigations. It was found that stress concentration factors determined from this type of fatigue testing came surprisingly close to those determined from the full-scale, three-dimensional, static tests. The selection of the type loadings used was not entirely arbitrary. The stress cycle, which varied from zero to a peak tension value and then to zero again, would closely simulate the loadings in a start-stop cycle; while the superposition of a cyclic stress upon a steady tension load would result in approximately the type of loading experienced by the blade when it was rotating at a constant angular speed under aeroelastic axial forces...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} related to damage detection represents a primary concern, particularly {{in the framework of}} composite structure. In fact, for this kind of structures barely visible damage can occur. Moreover, one of the major in-service damage of composite aircraft strcutures is represented by disbonds between the stiffeners and the skin undergoing dynamic or post-buckling loads. The effective implementation of a SHM system relies on the synthesis of non-destructive technique (NDT), fracture mechanics, sensors technology, data manipulation and signal processing, and it can receive a great improvement through the use of an Artificial Neural Networks. Different architectures of Artificial Neural Networks for a structural damage detection are studied in order to detect damage without any prior knowledge of the model of the structure so as to serve as a real-time data processor for SHM systems. The standard feed-forward Multi Layer Perceptron and the Radial Basis Function ANNs are compared. In the former paradigm each neuron is arranged in a series of layer. There are no precise rules for the choose of the number of hidden neurons, only empirical indications. Three training algorithms are considered: the Levenberg-Marquardt, the Conjugate Gradient backpropagation and the Gradient Descent with momentum. Moreover different complexity of the network are considered, by varying the number of hidden neurons. On the other hand, the RBF can require more neurons than standard MLP networks but they can be often designed to reduce the training time with respect to MLP. Two types of RBF are trained. The first can produce a network with zero error on training vectors but the number of hidden neurons is very high since it must be equal to the number of input vectors. So a second type of RBF is created by adding one neuron at each training input, until the sum-squared error falls beneath an error goal or a maximum number of neurons is reached. For the second type of ANNs instead, assumed that the number of hidden neurons is fixed due to the number of training data used to build and train all networks, a parametric analysis is made by changing the spread parameter. A drop-ply delaminated structure employed to represent a bidimensional simplification of the adhesive joints between composite aircraft fuselage skins and stiffners is here analyzed to study the sensing capability of the SHM system proposed. The analyzed configuration consists of an host delaminated structure, made up by 0 ° and 90 ° graphite-epoxy (GE) plies and of a piezoelectric patch, employed to arrange the sensing device. The skin is arranged with unidirectional graphite-expoxy plies. The drop-ply assembly deforms under plane strain conditions and it is clamped at the <b>flange</b> <b>root.</b> The structure undergoes several treansverse shear loads per unit length F acting on the free-edge of the skin. Moreover, for dynamic analyses the load is modeled as a step load to simulate the sudden raise of the shearing postbuckling action. Lastly, a delamination of length a is assumed to occur at the skin-flange 0 °/ 90 ° interfaces. The piezoelectric patch is assumed to be bonded on the flange top surface. The training data are obtained, in term of a Damage Index ID distribution, from a Dual Reciprocity Boundary Element Method transient analysis of the host damaged structure and the bonded piezoelectric sensor. The BEM model allows to compute the electrical signals that are used to define the ID generated by an array of piezoelectric sensors bonded on a delaminated composite skin-stiffner. Thirty-two delamination length and twenty-one load cases are analyzed. It has been observed that the RBF NN tipically requires larger number of training patterns and also a larger network architecture to achieve the same lavel of desired accuracy as the MLP. On the other hand, an advantage of using RBF NNs is that they require a training time inferior than the MLP N...|$|E
