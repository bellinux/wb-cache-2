5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, the O Street Market had once more become dilapidated. The {{structure}} fell into disrepair, trash collected around the building, many vendors were squatters without leases, and <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> gang members loitered nearby, driving customers away. The building's owner fell behind on tax payments, {{and the city}} threatened to place a lien on the building and foreclose.|$|E

Sobotka himself is arrested for smuggling; he agrees to work with the detail to help his son, finally seeing his actions as a mistake. However, the Greek learns about this through his mole inside the FBI and has Sobotka killed. The {{investigation}} ends with the fourteen homicides solved but the perpetrator already dead. Several <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> mid-level smuggling figures tied to the Greek are arrested, but he and his second-in-command escape uncharged and unidentified. The Major is pleased that Sobotka was arrested; the case is seen as a success by the commanding officers, but is viewed as a failure by the detail.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the game}} {{takes place in the}} Mojave Wasteland, which {{encompasses}} parts of the former states of California, Nevada and Arizona. Along with the three main factions, the region also has a number of minor factions which include: Boomers – a tribe of heavily armed former vault dwellers who have taken shelter at Nellis Air Force Base; Powder Gangers – a violent group of escaped convicts; Great Khans – a tribe of <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> raiders; and the Brotherhood of Steel – technology-craving remnants of the U.S. Army, who are attempting to secure any technology that could cause significant harm.

Her mother managed stores in the wedding {{industry}} and her father was a police officer with a vice squad, arresting <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> pimps. While she was growing up, Falle had multiple family members with addictions. When she was a young teenager, Falle's parents divorced, and she subsequently lived in a single-parent home with her mother. They moved into an apartment in downtown Toronto. Falle's father did not pay her mother alimony and there was often no money for food, so Falle began stealing food to survive.|$|E
5|$|Four middle-aged {{friends who}} {{have known each other}} since sixth form, Baxter (John Simm), Quinn (Philip Glenister), Rick (Marc Warren) and Woody (Max Beesley), get {{together}} for a holiday in Majorca at the villa of Alvo (Ben Chaplin), a mutual friend who became wealthy in the property business. Over time Alvo's behaviour becomes increasingly erratic, and he is later killed by a man in a Tony Blair mask for taking a drug boat the group used earlier. The four clean the boat to remove evidence of their presence, when they are mistaken for <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> paid three million euros. Afterwards, the four learn from María (María Botto), a local detective, that they are caught up in a Serbian mafia drug smuggling operation. Using video camera footage of their holiday, Baxter learns the real perpetrators are corrupt police officers, including María and her superior Dominic (Tim Woodward). Alvo is revealed {{to be a part of}} the operation, and was murdered when he no longer wanted to take part in it. María later attempts to kill the four when employing scare tactics to make them part with the cash fails to work, but is shot to death by Quinn. The other three run over Dominic to save Quinn. They leave with the money and accidentally board a ferry to Ibiza (their intention is to go to Barcelona).|$|E

25|$|Scorsese {{and writer}} Paul Schrader append the perfect {{conclusion}} to Taxi Driver. Steeped in irony, the five-minute epilogue underscores {{the vagaries of}} fate. The media builds Bickle into a hero, when, had he been a little quicker drawing his gun against Senator Palantine, {{he would have been}} reviled as an assassin. As the film closes, the misanthrope has been embraced as the model citizen—someone who takes on pimps, <b>drug</b> <b>dealers,</b> <b>and</b> mobsters to save one little girl.|$|E
25|$|William S. Burroughs (19141997) was {{the writer}} who finally brought science fiction {{together}} with the trends of postmodern literature. With the help of Jack Kerouac, Burroughs published Naked Lunch, {{the first of a}} series of novels employing a semi-dadaistic technique called the Cut-up and postmodern deconstructions of conventional society, pulling away the mask of normality to reveal nothingness beneath. Burroughs showed visions of society as a conspiracy of aliens, monsters, police states, <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> alternate levels of reality. The linguistics of science fiction merged with the experiments of postmodernism in a beat generation gestalt.|$|E

On February23, James Farmer, the leader of the Congress of Racial Equality, announced at a news conference that local <b>drug</b> <b>dealers,</b> <b>and</b> not the Nation of Islam, were to blame. Others accused the NYPD, the FBI, or the CIA, citing the lack of police protection, the ease with which the assassins entered the Audubon Ballroom, and the failure of the police to preserve the crime scene.

500|$|No.144 was {{occupied}} by squatters in 1968, {{taking advantage of a}} law that allowed disused buildings to be used for emergency shelter for the homeless. The radical squatting movement that resulted foundered soon after due to the rise of <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> Hell's Angels occupying the site. An eviction took place on 21 September 1969 and the events resulted in licensed squatting organisations that could take over empty premises to use as homeless shelters. In 1983, A. Burr of the British Journal of Addiction published an article on [...] "The Piccadilly Drug Scene", in which the author discussed the regular presence of known dealers and easy accessibility of drugs.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with its}} narratives, Illmatic is also {{distinct}} for its many portrayals {{and descriptions of}} places, people, and interactions. In his songs, Nas often depicts the corners and boulevards of Queensbridge, while mentioning the names of streets, friends, local crews and <b>drug</b> <b>dealers,</b> <b>and</b> utilizing vernacular slang indigenous to his hometown. Poet and author Kevin Coval describes this approach to songwriting {{as that of a}} “hip-hop poet-reporter...rooted in the intimate specificity of locale.” Commenting on Nas's use of narrative, Sohail Daulatzai, Professor of Film and Media Studies at University of Southern California, compares the album to cinema, citing its [...] "detailed descriptions, dense reportage, and visually stunning rhymes..." [...] In , he writes: [...] "Like the 1965 landmark masterpiece film The Battle of Algiers, which captured the Algerian resistance against French colonialism, Illmatic brilliantly blurred the lines between fiction and documentary, creating a heightened sense of realism and visceral eloquence for Nas's renegade first-person narratives and character-driven odes.” ...|$|E

The woman, the [...] "Invisigoth" [...] (Kristin Lehman) they've been looking for, warns the agents that a laser-armed Defense Department satellite has pinpointed their location. They quickly leave the area as the container is destroyed, supposedly by a [...] "Particle Beam" [...] shot from a defense satellite. [...] The Agents bring Invisigoth to meet the Lone Gunmen. Invisigoth, whose real name turns out to be Esther Nairn, tells the agents and the Lone Gunmen that Gelman succeeded in creating an artificial intelligence. She reveals that once the AI locates an enemy, it destroys them using the satellite. According to Esther, Gelman was creating [...] "Kill Switch", a virus that could destroy the AI. However, the AI learned of Gelman's plans and killed him by luring the <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> the police to the diner. The only way to destroy the AI is to find the computer on which it is stored. It turns out that David is Esther's friend, and also worked with Gelman.|$|E
500|$|Tyndall, also {{previously}} in the National Front, had founded the BNP in 1982, but his [...] "brutal, streetfighting background" [...] and admiration for Hitler and the Nazis had made {{any kind of}} respectability impossible. In his 1999 leadership campaign, Griffin embarked on a strategy to make the party electable, by taking it away from Tyndall's extremist image. He was helped by Tyndall's lack of familiarity with the mainstream media, and in the party's September election he defeated Tyndall to become head of the BNP. One of Griffin's changes included moderating the party's emphasis on the removal of multiculturalism, a policy it claims has a destructive influence on both immigrant and British cultures. Griffin pledged to eliminate [...] "the three Hs: hobbyism, hard talk and Hitler". This realignment was designed to position the BNP alongside successful European far-right groups, such as the French Front National. Street protests were replaced by electoral campaigning, and some policies were moderated (the compulsory repatriation of ethnic minorities was instead made voluntary). Other policies included the introduction of capital punishment for paedophiles, rapists, <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> some murderers, and corporal punishment for less serious crimes such as juvenile delinquency. Griffin's image as a Cambridge-educated family man was {{in contrast to the}} extremist image presented by the BNP under Tyndall's leadership. In October 1999, Nick Griffin, supported by Tony Lecomber stood against Tyndall for leadership of the BNP. John Tyndall received just 411 (30%) of the votes, while Griffin the majority, 70%.|$|E
