5|$|With his {{performance}} against Indiana, Robinson {{became the first}} player in Division I FBS history to have two regular season games with 200 yards rushing and 200 yards passing. Seven others have accomplished the feat (including Pat White, Vince Young and Antwaan Randle El), but none have done so more than once <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>season.</b> Vince Young accomplished this feat once <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> and once in the Rose Bowl.|$|E
5|$|After {{making the}} playoffs in 1989, the Giants entered the 1990 season as a Super Bowl favorite, though most {{believed}} they stood little chance of stopping the 49ers. The Giants began {{the season with a}} 27–20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, then won their next nine games before losing a rematch to Philadelphia 31–13 in Week 12. The Giants also lost close games to the 49ers on the road and to the Bills at home <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> before defeating both teams in playoff rematches. In the Week 15 game against Buffalo, starting quarterback Phil Simms was injured and ultimately lost for the season with a broken foot. He was replaced by Hostetler, who did not lose a game. The Giants' defense led the NFL in fewest points allowed (211), and the team set an NFL record by committing only 14 turnovers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>season.</b> After the season, six Giants were selected to the Pro Bowl.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, the Devils {{finished}} {{first in the}} Atlantic Division with 108 points. Their playoff run included a seven-game Conference Final series victory, decided in the final three minutes on a goal by forward Jeff Friesen, over the Ottawa Senators. In the Stanley Cup Finals, the Devils and Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had a back-and-forth battle, as both teams won all of their home games. The Devils brought the Stanley Cup to New Jersey for a third time, defeating the Mighty Ducks in the seventh game of the Finals in New Jersey. After the series, Daneyko, a long-time fan favorite, announced his retirement. Brodeur was awarded the Vezina Trophy as outstanding goaltender <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> {{for the first time}} in his career, having won 41 games <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> to top the NHL.|$|E

5|$|After {{spending}} {{two weeks}} {{on the disabled list}} with a groin strain during the opening month of the 1998 season, Rivera continued to establish himself as one of the major leagues' best closers. Moreover, he became the central figure of a Yankees bullpen that, supported by middle relievers Jeff Nelson and Mike Stanton, contributed to the team's late-1990s dynasty. That year, Rivera made the cutter one of his primary pitches, and it quickly became his signature, earning a reputation for breaking hitters' bats with its sharp lateral movement. He saved 36games in 41opportunities and had a 1.91ERA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>season.</b> In the 1998 postseason, he pitched scoreless innings and saved six games, three of which came in the 1998 World Series against the San Diego Padres. Rivera's save in Game 4 of the series clinched the Yankees' championship, capping off a season in which they won an MLB-record 125games combined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> and the postseason. By season's end, Rivera had allowed only two earned runs in 35 career postseason innings pitched—a 0.51ERA—and by passing 30innings pitched, he qualified for the major league record for lowest postseason career ERA; it is a record he still holds after 141innings pitched.|$|E
