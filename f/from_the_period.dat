5|$|In Roman Britain Cumbria was the {{territory}} of the Carvetii. As the site of the western part of Hadrian's Wall, it was of strategic importance. The north of the county is rich in archaeological evidence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>period,</b> but nothing is known that suggests any Roman habitation in the Keswick area, other than finds that point to the existence of one or more Roman highways passing the vicinity of the present-day town. Such nearby settlements as can be traced from the era of the Romans and the years after their departure seem to have been predominantly Celtic. Many local place names <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>period,</b> including that of the River Derwent, are Celtic, some closely related to Welsh equivalents.|$|E

5|$|Although Clinch {{believed}} that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they {{had lived in the}} 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or books <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>period.</b> This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617– after1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.|$|E

5|$|Although a few hagiographies, or saints' biographies, {{about native}} British saints survive <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> of the mission, none {{describes}} native Christians as active missionaries amongst the Anglo-Saxons. Most {{of the information}} about the British church at this time is concerned with the western regions of the island of Great Britain and does not deal with the Gregorian missionaries. Other sources of information include Bede's chronologies, the set of laws issued by Æthelberht in Kent, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was compiled in the late 9th century.|$|E

Modern digs in Tahiti and the other Society Islands have uncovered few surviving remains of the Tahitian Dog. In 1960, a few canine teeth were uncovered at Ana Paia shelter, on Mo'orea. In 1962, a complete skull, limbs, and vertebrae were discovered at a marae site on Mo'orea along with a jawbone at another site on the same island.|$|E
5|$|As the 19thcentury {{gave way}} to the 20th, there {{followed}} in quick succession the Philippine Revolution, which spawned the short-lived First Philippine Republic, followed by the bloody Philippine–American War of conquest by US military force. Aside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> of Japanese occupation, the United States retained sovereignty over the islands until after World War II, when the Philippines was recognized as an independent nation. Since then, the Philippines has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by a non-violent revolution.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, more {{administrative}} records <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> {{had become}} available to historians such as William Stubbs, Thomas Tout and J. C. Davies, who focused {{on the development of the}} English constitutional and governmental system during his reign. Although critical of what they regarded as Edward's inadequacies as a king, they also emphasised the growth of the role of parliament and the reduction in personal royal authority under Edward II, which they perceived as positive developments. During the 1970s the historiography of Edward's reign shifted away from this model, supported by the further publishing of records <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> in the last quarter of the 20th century. The work of Jeffrey Denton, Jeffrey Hamilton, John Maddicott and Seymour Phillips re-focused attention on the role of the individual leaders in the conflicts. With the exceptions of Hilda Johnstone's work on Edward's early years, and Natalie Fryde's study of Edward's final years, the focus of the major historical studies for several years was on the leading magnates rather than Edward himself, until substantial biographies of the King were published by Roy Haines and Seymour Phillips in 2003 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|Cairano was {{undoubtedly}} {{affected by this}} period of sudden and profound decay, if {{only because of the}} sharp decline in commissions. After a decade of intense activity with several overlapping projects, a new stage in his career began, one which is obscured from the documentary view. The last relevant document in this regard is the contract for the entrance to the Duomo of Chiari in 1513, while the next document, in 1517, states that Cairano was already dead. Apart from this, there are other works <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> attributed to him, including the complex question of the completion of the Martinengo mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{surviving}} documentation, {{it is difficult to}} attribute unsigned works <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> with any degree of certainty. The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.|$|E

5|$|From 1833–36, {{he lived}} in Switzerland. A third volume of his poems, {{published}} in 1833 and containing works <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> of the Uprising, was far more nationalist in tone, and won more recognition in his homeland. At the same time, he wrote several works featuring romantic themes, and beautiful scenery, such as W Szwajcarii (In Switzerland), Rozłączenie (Separation), Stokrótki (Daisies) and Chmury (Clouds).|$|E
5|$|He {{also studied}} other vessels <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>period,</b> {{such as the}} Le Soleil Royal, La Couronne, La Royale and Le Reale de France, to better {{understand}} 17th-century ship design. It was from the Le Reale de France that he gained a basis for his design of the Unicorn jolly boat. No ship named the Unicorn was listed {{in the annals of}} the French Navy, but Hergé instead took the name from a British frigate which had been active in the mid-18th century; the fictional ship's unicorn figurehead was also adopted from the frigate.|$|E
5|$|In 1066, {{the comet}} {{was seen in}} England and thought to be an omen: later that year Harold II of England died at the Battle of Hastings; {{it was a bad}} omen for Harold, but a good omen for the man who {{defeated}} him, William the Conqueror. The comet is represented on the Bayeux Tapestry and described in the tituli as a star. Surviving accounts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> describe it as appearing to be four times the size of Venus and shining with a light equal to a quarter of that of the Moon.
