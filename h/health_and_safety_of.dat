5|$|The widowed Vernal {{remarried}} to Catherine Davis Goodall in 1849, but trusteeship of Virginia Thorne, by now a teenager, {{remained with}} Margaret. With {{most of his}} time spent in the nation's capital, Houston's perception of Thorne was primarily second-hand gleanings from Margaret's letters; yet, he disliked and distrusted the orphaned girl {{to the point where he}} feared for the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> his children with her in the house. Exacerbating the situation was Margaret's disapproval of the relationship that the teenage girl developed with overseer Thomas Gott. Push literally came to shove during an incident in which Margaret disciplined her for what she believed was rough handling of one of the children. Thorne alleged that during the ensuing dispute over the situation, Margaret had used threats and physical violence against her. After she eloped with Gott a month later, the couple filed assault and battery charges against Margaret. When a grand jury investigation resulted in a deadlock, the matter was referred to the local Baptist church that Margaret helped found, and she was acquitted of the charges. Houston came to believe that the filing of legal charges against his wife had been encouraged by his political enemies.|$|E

The <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> practices <b>of</b> construction small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Ghana are examined with a view to improving the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> performance <b>of</b> the sector.

Few of the SMEs adopted proactive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> practices.

Faulty wiring had also caused a malfunction on the ride. In October 2004, the deputy coroner ruled death by misadventure. On November 14, 2006, the park was charged with failing to ensure the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> riders, and the ride operator was charged with failing to ensure safety through his work.

25|$|Wen was {{involved}} in two major episodes involving public health. In early 2003, he {{was involved}} in ending the official inaction over the SARS crisis. On 1 December 2004, he became the first major Chinese official to publicly address the problem of AIDS, which has devastated parts of Yunnan and Henan and threatens to be a major burden on Chinese development. Since May 2004, Wen made various visits to communities devastated by AIDS, trips shown prominently on national media. By showing these actions, Wen displayed an effort to reverse years of what many activists have described as a policy of denial and inaction. Furthermore, Wen is concerned about the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> previous drug addicts; since March 2004, Wen had visited several drug addict treatment facilities in southern China and addressed the issue to the patients in person, recognizing that AIDS {{is more likely to be}} spread by drug abuse and the reuse of hypodermic syringes than by sexual contact.|$|E

Of the possible hazards, inhalation exposure appears to present the most concern, with animal studies showing pulmonary effects such as inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinogenicity for some nanomaterials.
