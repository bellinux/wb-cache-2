5|$|Applicant (license holder) must {{be cleared}} by his general {{practitioner}} as being fit to possess, carry {{and use a}} firearm. The health check includes probes into the applicant's anamnesis (i.e. medical history) and a complete physical screening (including eyesight, hearing, balance). The <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> request examination by a specialist in case he deems it necessary to exclude illnesses or handicaps stated in the respective governmental regulation. Specialist medical examination is obligatory in case of illnesses and handicaps that restrict the ability to drive a car.|$|E
25|$|Your <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> {{ask about}} recent {{activities}} and {{things you have}} recently eaten, followed by a physical examination in order to review your symptoms. With more severe symptoms, blood tests and stool culture may be in order.|$|E
25|$|Anti-inflammatory {{medicines}} such as aspirin, naproxen or ibuprofen {{among others}} {{can be taken to}} help with pain. In some cases the physical therapist will use ultrasound and electrical stimulation, as well as manipulation. Gentle stretching and strengthening exercises are added gradually. If there is no improvement, the <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> inject a corticosteroid medicine into the space under the acromion. However, recent level one evidence showed limited efficacy of corticosteroid injections for pain relief. While steroid injections are a common treatment, they must be used with caution because they may lead to tendon rupture. If there is still no improvement after 6 to 12 months, the <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> perform either arthroscopic or open surgery to repair damage and relieve pressure on the tendons and bursae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Doctors</b> <b>may</b> also {{prescribe}} antibiotics such as clindamycin, doxycycline, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.|$|R
5000|$|Monitor {{blood sugar}} level frequently, <b>doctors</b> <b>may</b> ask {{to check the}} blood glucose more often than usual.|$|R
50|$|In {{emergencies}} and in chronically understaffed health systems, all staff, including junior <b>doctors,</b> <b>may</b> be overworked. In some cases, excess {{work may}} be disproportionately assigned to junior doctors.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to assessing {{the size of}} the pituitary tumor, doctors also look for damage to surrounding tissues, and perform tests to assess whether production of other pituitary hormones is normal. Depending on {{the size of the}} tumor, the <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> request an eye exam with measurement of visual fields.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of the skin assists a doctor in determining a diagnosis. A <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> also suggest blood tests, a wound culture, or other tests to help rule out a blood clot deep in the veins of the legs. Cellulitis in the lower leg is characterized by signs and symptoms {{similar to those of}} a deep vein thrombosis, such as warmth, pain, and swelling (inflammation).|$|E
25|$|For toddlers: doctors may {{recommend}} a treatment {{with a mild}} dandruff shampoo such as Selsun Blue or Neutrogena T-gel, even though the treatment may cause initial additional scalp irritation. A <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> instead prescribe an antifungal soap such as ketoconazole (2%) shampoo, which can work in a single treatment and shows significantly less irritation than over-the-counter shampoos such as selenium disulfide shampoos, but no adequate and controlled study has been conducted for pediatric use as of 2010.|$|E
50|$|Performing this {{exercise}} routinely can strengthen glutes, abs, {{and lower back}} muscles. As a result, <b>doctors</b> <b>may</b> recommend pelvic lifts to reduce lower back pain, improve posture, and improve bladder control.|$|R
50|$|If a {{blockage}} {{is present}} in the puncti, <b>doctors</b> <b>may</b> suggest a procedure called punctoplasty, performed to widen the drain opening. This usually takes 20-30 minutes and is performed under local anesthesia.|$|R
50|$|Pain can be {{relieved}} for some by gentle massage and heat. Parents/guardians should always {{talk to their}} childâ€™s healthcare provider before trying any medication. <b>Doctors</b> <b>may</b> recommend trying over-the-counter pain-relievers, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen.|$|R
25|$|In Bolivia, all {{medical schools}} are faculties within a {{university}} {{and offer a}} five-year M.D. equivalent. To acquire a license to exercise medical science from the government, all students must also complete 1 year and 3 months of internship. This consists of 3 months each of surgery, internal medicine, gynecology, pediatrics and public health. At {{least one of the}} internships must be done in a rural area of the country. After getting the degree and license, a <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> take a post-graduate residency in order to acquire a specialty.|$|E
25|$|Confirmation of the {{diagnosis}} is made {{with the help of}} tests such as endoscopies or barium contrast x-rays. The tests are typically ordered if the symptoms do not resolve after a few weeks of treatment, or when they first appear in a person who is over age 45 or who has other symptoms such as weight loss, because stomach cancer can cause similar symptoms. Also, when severe ulcers resist treatment, particularly if a person has several ulcers or the ulcers are in unusual places, a <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> suspect an underlying condition that causes the stomach to overproduce acid.|$|E
25|$|Examples include when {{a patient}} does not want a {{treatment}} because of, for example, religious or cultural views. In the case of euthanasia, the patient, or relatives of a patient, may want to end {{the life of the}} patient. Also, the patient may want an unnecessary treatment, as can be the case in hypochondria or with cosmetic surgery; here, the practitioner may be required to balance the desires of the patient for medically unnecessary potential risks against the patient's informed autonomy in the issue. A <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> want to prefer autonomy because refusal to please the patient's self-determination would harm the doctor-patient relationship.|$|E
50|$|Peak flow {{readings}} {{are higher}} when patients are well, and lower when the airways are constricted. From changes in recorded values, patients and <b>doctors</b> <b>may</b> determine lung functionality, {{the severity of}} asthma symptoms, and treatment.|$|R
5000|$|For {{idiopathic}} toe {{walking in}} young children, <b>doctors</b> <b>may</b> prefer {{to watch and}} wait: the child may [...] "outgrow" [...] the condition. If there is {{a reduction in the}} child's range of motion, there are several options.|$|R
25|$|For infants: {{in cases}} {{that are related to}} fungal infection, such as Tinea capitis, <b>doctors</b> <b>may</b> {{recommend}} a treatment application of clotrimazole (commonly prescribed for jock itch or athlete's foot) or miconazole (commonly prescribed for vaginal yeast infections).|$|R
25|$|Following {{a visual}} {{examination}} and a dermatoscopic exam, or in vivo diagnostic {{tools such as}} a confocal microscope, the <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> biopsy the suspicious mole. A skin biopsy performed under local anesthesia is often required to assist in making or confirming the diagnosis and in defining severity. Elliptical excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, followed by histological analysis and Breslow scoring. Incisional biopsies such as punch biopsies are usually contraindicated in suspected melanomas, because {{of the possibility of}} sampling error or local implantation causing misestimation of tumour thickness. However, fears that such biopsies may increase the risk of metastatic disease seem unfounded.|$|E
25|$|In modern {{clinical}} practice, physicians personally assess {{patients in}} order to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The doctor-patient relationship typically begins an interaction with {{an examination of the}} patient's medical history and medical record, followed by a medical interview and a physical examination. Basic diagnostic medical devices (e.g. stethoscope, tongue depressor) are typically used. After examination for signs and interviewing for symptoms, the <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> order medical tests (e.g. blood tests), take a biopsy, or prescribe pharmaceutical drugs or other therapies. Differential diagnosis methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided. During the encounter, properly informing the patient of all relevant facts {{is an important part of}} the relationship and the development of trust. The medical encounter is then documented in the medical record, which is a legal document in many jurisdictions. Follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure, and specialists follow a similar process. The diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks depending upon the complexity of the issue.|$|E
500|$|Peterson abducts Skye {{and makes}} her delete his and Ace's {{personal}} {{information from the}} government's systems, though she manages to warn the team at the same time. The two are tracked to a train station by Coulson's team and a gunman sent by Peterson's <b>doctor.</b> <b>May</b> takes out the gunman, and Ward shoots Peterson with an advanced stun gun developed by Fitz and Simmons, which stabilizes his extremis. Afterwards, Coulson offers Skye a place on his team when a call for an [...] "0-8-4" [...] comes in.|$|E
30|$|In practice, <b>doctors</b> <b>may</b> {{have their}} own {{preferences}} for substitution transfusion according to their clinical experience. For decision makers of emergency blood allocation, {{it is important to}} understand the impact of priorities of ABO/Rh(D)-compatible substitution on allocation solution.|$|R
50|$|For infants: {{in cases}} {{that are related to}} fungal infection, such as Tinea capitis, <b>doctors</b> <b>may</b> {{recommend}} a treatment application of clotrimazole (commonly prescribed for jock itch or athlete's foot) or miconazole (commonly prescribed for vaginal yeast infections).|$|R
50|$|Some {{specialist}} {{services are}} provided by Consultants from Raigmore Hospital in Inverness on a rotational basis, and also by locum consultants. Junior <b>doctors</b> <b>may</b> be on rotations that take them across {{other parts of the}} north of Scotland.|$|R
500|$|People {{sometimes}} have recent onset of atypical {{type 2 diabetes}} {{that is difficult to}} control, a history of recent but unexplained blood vessel inflammation caused by blood clots (thrombophlebitis) known as Trousseau sign, or a previous attack of pancreatitis. A <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> suspect pancreatic cancer when the onset of diabetes in someone over 50 years old is accompanied [...] by typical symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, persistent abdominal or back pain, indigestion, vomiting, or fatty feces. Jaundice accompanied by a painlessly swollen gallbladder (known as Courvoisier's sign) may also raise suspicion, and can help differentiate pancreatic cancer from gallstones.|$|E
500|$|DVD Talk's John Sinnott {{rated the}} first series {{four and a}} half out of five stars, writing that it [...] "keeps a lot of the charm and {{excitement}} of the original (as well as the premise), while making the series easily accessible for new viewers". Sinnott praised the faster pace and the design changes that made it feel [...] "fresh", as well as Eccleston's Doctor. However, he felt that Piper only did a [...] "credible" [...] job as Eccleston eclipsed her, and said that the writing was [...] "uneven" [...] with many of the episodes [...] "just slightly flawed". Looking back on the series in 2011, Stephen Kelly of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Eccleston's <b>Doctor</b> <b>may</b> have had many faultsâ€“ looking like an EastEnders extra and bellowing [...] "FANTASTIC!" [...] at every opportunity being two of themâ€“ but he was merely a reflection of a show that, at the time, still didn't know what it wanted to be. The first series of the revived Doctor Whoâ€“ which featured farting aliensâ€“ was a world away from the intelligent, populist science-fiction we know it as now. But then, it is thanks to Eccleston that it got this far at allâ€“ a big, respectable name who laid the foundations for Tennant to swag away with the show." ...|$|E
500|$|The College of Physicians (renamed in 1674 to the Royal College of Physicians) was {{an elite}} organisation. Created by royal charter in 1518, {{it was founded}} by six English {{academic}} doctors trained in English universities. It admitted only British men who had trained at a university and passed a three-part Latin exam in medical theory. Only 24 Fellows were allowed, and if an entrant {{came at a time}} when all 24 Fellowships were full, he would instead become a Candidate, the most senior Candidate being admitted to the first vacant Fellowship. An Act of Parliament confirming the royal charter also gave the college the ability to act as a court to judge other practitioners and to punish those who were acting badly or practising without a licence. A second Act, the College of Physicians Act 1553, amended the charter and gave the college the right to imprison indefinitely those judged. That [...] "flew {{in the face of the}} common law assumption that to practice medicine one needed only the consent of the patient". Still, on 8 April 1602, John Popham, the Chief Justice, upheld the college's authority to imprison and fine: [...] "That no man, though never so learned a Phisition, or <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> Practise in London, or within seaven myles, without the Colledge Lycense.... That a free man of London, may lawfully be imprysoned by the Colledge".|$|E
50|$|Insulin may {{be needed}} for type 2 diabetics instead of oral {{diabetes}} medication. Extra insulin {{may be needed}} for type 1 diabetics during pregnancy. <b>Doctors</b> <b>may</b> advise to check blood sugar more often to maintain near-normal blood sugar levels.|$|R
50|$|After {{obtaining a}} doctorate, Dutch <b>doctors</b> <b>may</b> bear either the title dr. (lower case) before, or the letter D {{following}} their name, but not both simultaneously. There is no specific notation {{of the discipline}} in which the doctorate is obtained.|$|R
50|$|Patients {{are also}} {{sometimes}} treated pharmacologically. To both induce menses and improve bone density, <b>doctors</b> <b>may</b> prescribe cyclic estrogen or progesterone as {{is used to}} treat post-menopausal women. Patients may also be put on oral contraceptives to stimulate regular periods. In addition to hormone therapy, nutrition supplements <b>may</b> be recommended. <b>Doctors</b> <b>may</b> prescribe calcium supplements. Vitamin D supplements may be also used because this vitamin aids in calcium absorption. Bisphosphonates and calcitonin, used to treat adults with osteoporosis, may be prescribed, although their effectiveness in adolescents {{has not yet been}} established. Finally, if indicated by a psychiatric examination, the affected athlete may be prescribed anti-depressants and in some cases benzodiazepines to help in alleviating severe distress at mealtimes.|$|R
2500|$|In the BBC Series 4 FAQ, writer Russell T Davies made a {{joke that}} now the Time Lord social order has been destroyed, the <b>Doctor</b> <b>may</b> be able to {{regenerate}} indefinitely: [...] "Now that his people are gone, who knows? Time Lords used to have 13 lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis of {{tendinitis}} and bursitis {{begins with}} a medical history and physical examination. X rays do not show tendons or the bursae but may be helpful in ruling out bony abnormalities or arthritis. The <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> remove and test fluid from the inflamed area to rule out infection.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>doctor</b> <b>may</b> order an {{electromyogram}} {{to diagnose}} muscle or nerve problems. This test measures involuntary muscle activity and muscle response to nerve stimulation. The {{selection of the}} sensors used is important. In addition to studies of muscle activity, tremor can be assessed with accuracy using accelerometers [...]|$|E

25|$|In {{stubborn}} cases some <b>doctors</b> <b>may</b> recommend keratolytic (dandruff) shampoos (e.g. with sulfur, selenium, zinc pyrithione, or salicylic acid) {{while others}} warn {{against the use}} of medicated shampoos in newborns due to systemic absorption. Dandruff shampoos often contain sodium dodecyl sulfate, a noted skin irritant.|$|R
