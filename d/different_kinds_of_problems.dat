25|$|The planisphere was a {{star chart}} invented by Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī in the early 11th century.

An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235. Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe, an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine with a gear train and gear-wheels, circa 1000 AD. The castle clock, a hydropowered mechanical astronomical clock invented by Al-Jazari in 1206, was the first programmable analog computer.|$|E

JOB-SCHEDULER produces a job sequence for a robot to perform the goal state given {{the constraints of the}} block world.

5000|$|Training can {{effectively}} debias decision makers {{over the long}} term. Training, to date, has received less attention by academics and policy makers than incentives and nudges because initial debiasing training efforts resulted in mixed success (see Fischhoff, 1982 in Kahneman et al.). Decision makers could be effectively debiased through training in specific domains. For example, experts can be trained to make very accurate decisions when decision making entails recognizing patterns and applying appropriate responses in domains such as firefighting, chess, and weather forecasting. Evidence of more general debiasing, across domains and <b>different</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems,</b> however, was not discovered until recently. The reason {{for the lack of}} more domain-general debiasing was attributed to experts failing to recognize the underlying [...] "deep structure" [...] of problems in different formats and domains. Weather forecasters are able to predict rain with high accuracy, for example, but show the same overconfidence in their answers to basic trivia questions as other people. An exception was graduate training in scientific fields heavily reliant on statistics such as psychology.|$|E
