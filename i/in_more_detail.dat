5|$|After its U.S. debut, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was {{released}} in Japan under the title Final Fantasy USA: Mystic Quest. The European release of the game {{was released}} in English, German and French, and had the title changed to Mystic Quest Legend to avoid confusion with Final Fantasy Adventure, which had been released in Europe as Mystic Quest. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was first unveiled in June at the 1992 Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, where it was a popular venue, and the game was later presented <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>detail</b> in the Fall 1992 issue of the Ogopogo Examiner.|$|E
5|$|After {{the novel}} was published, it caused {{considerable}} discussion. Religious thinkers, Marxist-Leninists, and anarchists decried the novel for not explaining their ideologies <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>detail,</b> but literary figures {{and many in}} the general public praised it; this positive reception may {{have been influenced by}} the nascent government's need to promote literature for nation-building. Atheis was translated into Malay before 1970 and into English in 1972; it was also adapted into a film with the same title in 1974. The novel, which received an award from the Indonesian government in 1969, is one of the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Michael Howell and Peter Ford {{published}} The True History of the Elephant Man, {{presenting the}} fruits of their detailed archival research. Howell and Ford brought to light a large amount of new information about Merrick. In addition to proving that his name was Joseph, not John, they were able to describe <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>detail</b> his life story. They refuted some of the inaccuracies in Treves's account, showing that Merrick's mother did not abandon him, and that Merrick deliberately chose to exhibit himself to make a living.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 Greene {{published}} his {{book about the}} excavations entitled Norton Priory: The Archaeology of a Medieval Religious House. Further work has been carried out, recording and analysing the archaeological findings. In 2008 Fraser Brown and Christine Howard-Davis published Norton Priory: Monastery to Museum, in which the findings are described <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>detail.</b> Howard-Davis was {{largely responsible for the}} post-excavation assessment and for compiling a database for the artefacts and, with Brown, for their analysis.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, Michael Heidelberger and Oswald Avery {{observed}} that antigens could be precipitated by antibodies {{and went on}} to show that antibodies are made of protein. The biochemical properties of antigen-antibody-binding interactions were examined <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>detail</b> in the late 1930s by John Marrack. The next major advance was in the 1940s, when Linus Pauling confirmed the lock-and-key theory proposed by Ehrlich by showing that the interactions between antibodies and antigens depend more on their shape than their chemical composition. In 1948, Astrid Fagreaus discovered that B cells, in the form of plasma cells, were responsible for generating antibodies.|$|E

As of 2017, much of the detailed knowledge of Ariel derives from a single flyby of Uranus performed by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in 1986, which managed to image around 35% of the moon's surface.

5|$|Nigersaurus {{was named}} and {{described}} <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>detail</b> by Sereno and colleagues only in 1999, based on remains of newly found individuals. The same article also named Jobaria, another sauropod from Niger. The genus name Nigersaurus ("Niger reptile") is {{a reference to}} the country where it was discovered, and the specific name taqueti honours Taquet, who was the first to organise large-scale palaeontological expeditions to Niger. The holotype specimen (MNN GAD512) consists of a partial skull and neck. Limb material and a scapula found nearby were also referred to the same specimen. These fossils are housed at the National Museum of Niger.|$|E
5|$|Numerous etiologies of {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{have been}} described.

Later, in 1939, at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Louis Hamman described it in postpartum woman; indeed, subcutaneous emphysema is sometimes known as Hamman's syndrome. However, in some medical circles, it can instead be more commonly known as Macklin's Syndrome after L. Macklin, in 1939, and M.T. and C.C.

5|$|Religion plays a {{large part}} in the Forgotten Realms, with deities and their {{followers}} being {{an integral part of}} the world. They do not have a passive role, but in fact interact directly in mortal affairs, answer prayers, and have their own personal agendas. All deities must have worshipers to survive, and all mortals must worship a patron deity to secure a good afterlife. A huge number of diverse deities exist within several polytheistic pantheons; a large number of supplements have documented many of them, some <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>detail</b> than others.|$|E

5|$|After {{just over}} a year with Cheerleader, Rollason left the company to {{concentrate}} on her broadcasting career, and became a freelance reporter. She covered the 1987 World Student Games from Zagreb for Thames Television, and then presented the 1988 World Junior Athletics championships from Sudbury, Ontario for Channel 4. Later on in 1988, she provided coverage of that year's Summer Olympics, held in Seoul, for ITV. During the mid-1980s, she also joined the presenting team of the BBC children's news programme, Newsround, with a view to increasing its sports coverage, and presented several features on topics such as gymnastics and female jockeys, as well as presenting Newsround Extra, a show that covered a specific issue <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>detail.</b> One such programme was a report on the street children of Bogotá, a subject that deeply moved her and reduced her to tears on screen.|$|E
5|$|Aleister Crowley {{wrote in}} The Antecedents of Thelema, (1926), an {{incomplete}} work not published in his day, that Rabelais not only set forth {{the law of}} Thelema in a way similar to how Crowley understood it, but predicted and described in code Crowley's life and the holy text that {{he claimed to have}} received, The Book of the Law. Crowley said the work he had received was deeper, showing <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>detail</b> the technique people should practice, and revealing scientific mysteries.
