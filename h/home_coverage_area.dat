Location awareness {{is becoming more}} important also in environments where satellite-based positioning are not available, such as urban areas and indoors. In this work, a method to estimate the <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> of a wireless communication node is presented. Also a method to use a database of such <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> estimates for personal positioning is presented. <b>Coverage</b> <b>area</b> estimates are computed using location fingerprinting. The <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> is solved by forming the posterior distribution of the parameters using Bayes' rule. The <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> of a communication node is modeled as an ellipse and is assumed to follow a multivariate normal linear model, which {{is presented as a}} general case. The <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> estimate is derived using both noninformative and informative priors. Also a model which assumes a possibility of outliers and a Bayesian method for detecting outliers are presented. A positioning method which uses the <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> estimates is presented. The distribution of a position estimate is derived using Bayes' rule. The position estimate is weighted average of the centers of ellipses and the weights are determined by the shape parameters of ellipses. Finally, the accuracy and consistency of a position estimate are studied using different coverage estimates.

40|$|Deploying Femtocells {{inside a}} {{macrocell}} network can significantly increase the macrocell capacity {{in terms of}} network optimisation. However, the deployment of femtocells within a macrocell <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> causes severe femto-femto interferences, which may {{have an impact on}} the overall performance of femtocells. Avoiding such interference is very important for co-existence of femtocells. In this paper, we propose a novel femtocell resource allocation scheme to alleviate the problem of Co-tier interference. In the proposed scheme orthogonal resources are allocated to the closed access femtocells to avoid interference to other femtocells, while we divide the open access femtocell <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> into two <b>coverage</b> <b>area,</b> an inner and an outer <b>coverage</b> <b>area.</b> The resources are allocated to both <b>coverage</b> <b>areas</b> of the open access femtocells in a way that avoids co-tier interference while increasing the spectrum efficiency...|$|R

For these reasons, it is beneficial to use a StingRay and a test phone to map out the precise <b>coverage</b> <b>areas</b> of all cell sites appearing in the HCSLI records. This is typically done at the same time of day and under the same weather conditions that were in effect when the HCSLI was logged.
