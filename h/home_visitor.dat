40|$|The {{first three}} years of life are a period where {{significant}} growth occurs in all areas of development to prepare infants and toddlers for further learning. Early experiences and relationships impact that early cognitive development. As the literature suggests, the greatest opportunity to break the cycle of poverty and decrease the achievement gap is to intervene early with at risk young children and families. In order to promote resiliency, it is imperative that children have at least one adult who is a consistent and reliable figure in their lives. Early childhood intervention programs serve to empower parents to meet that need. The literature has identified the challenges and opportunities of working with highly stressed, at-risk families and children and there has been much focus on understanding what increases the chances of highly stressed parents to become engaged and partner in Early Head Start interventions. Research has shown that matching <b>home</b> <b>visitors</b> with families is a significant piece of obtaining and maintaining engagement (engagement of staff members as well as by parents). However, there is a dearth of literature on the process of matching <b>home</b> <b>visitors</b> to families from the perspectives of parents, <b>home</b> <b>visitors,</b> and program leaders. The goal {{of this study was to}} use a socially just process to enhance collaboration practices at an Early Head Start program. This study was intended to explore those perspectives in order to guide better practices with building and maintaining effective working relationships to carry out Early Head Start interventions.

40|$|Objective: The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to use an {{ecological}} assessment model to obtain a better under-standing of difficult situations that <b>home</b> <b>visitors</b> confront when implementing home visitation services. Method: A mixed method study was used which included conducting focus groups to identify specific situations faced by <b>home</b> <b>visitors</b> who implement the Healthy Families America model of child abuse and neglect prevention. The results of the focus groups were used to design a survey. The survey had 91 Healthy Families <b>home</b> <b>visitors</b> rate situations according to frequency and difficulty. Results: The results revealed that situations that were ranked most difficult included working with families where there are limited resources, where family mental illness is present (e. g., threatening suicide), where there is substance use in the home, and where families are unmotivated. A factor analysis of the situations produced five factors that reflect the difficulty of doing home visitation: having a lack of clinical skill, addressing family difficulties, addressing parenting difficulties, resolving personal difficulties, and having a lack of experience. Conclusion: The situations identified in this study can assist in developing the competencies needed by <b>home</b> <b>visitors.</b> The factor analysis results can be conceptualized into an inventory for staff supervision, with workers completing the inventory to identify individual areas of training needs...|$|R

Latino {{families}} comprise over a {{third of}} the enrollment of Early Head Start (EHS), a federally funded child development program serving low-income pregnant women and {{children under the age of}} three (Office of Head Start, 2015). Utilizing an ecological systems framework and critical race feminist lens, this qualitative study examines the experiences of immigrant Latina mothers participating in an EHS program in Delaware. The primary focus is on how mothers and EHS <b>home</b> <b>visitors</b> negotiate different child rearing practices and parental ethnotheories in the context of a home visiting program model. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with a total of 22 participants, representing the perspectives of mothers, <b>home</b> <b>visitors,</b> and an administrator. Interviews with Latina mothers revealed that they appreciated the opportunities gained by raising young children in Delaware even while they faced challenges that might have been reduced by living in a more familiar environment. Latina mothers compensated for the loss of support systems due to migration by relying more heavily on formal resources and services, including the relationships they built with their <b>home</b> <b>visitors.</b> Strong relationships with <b>home</b> <b>visitors</b> and the perception that their beliefs were respected led mothers to share positive impressions of their involvement with EHS. <b>Home</b> <b>visitors</b> reported success negotiating cultural differences by recognizing parental authority and discussing sensitive topics after establishing relationships based on trust and openness.

Stations in other countries also carry such a service in this fashion. Some radio reading services are broadcast on standard FM stations.

The station's radio format has a fair mixture of contemporary rock, indie rock, punk rock and other assorted genres.

In 2010, a completely student written and performed radio noir show began broadcasting on the station, {{making it one of the}} only non-music programs available on the station. WRKC was formerly a mixed news, talk and music station but in the last fifteen years went to a complete radio format, save for the aforementioned radio noir show and the station's anchor program, the Radio <b>Home</b> <b>Visitor,</b> a news program that has read the day's local newspapers to the blind since 1974.

This paper seeks to evaluate fidelity in a 27 -month program addressing {{maternal and child health}} which took place in France between 2006 and 2011. To evaluate implementation fidelity, home visit case notes were analyzed using thematic qualitative and computer-assisted linguistic analyses. During the prenatal period, <b>home</b> <b>visitors</b> focused on the social components of the program. Visitors discussed the physical changes in pregnancy, and psychological and social environment issues. Discussing immigration, unstable employment and financial related issues, family relationships and dynamics and maternity services, while not expected, were found in case notes. Conversely, health during pregnancy, early child development and postpartum mood changes were not identified as topics within the prenatal case notes. During the postnatal period, most components of the intervention were addressed: <b>home</b> <b>visitors</b> observed the mother's adaptation to the baby; routine themes such as psychological needs and medical-social networks were evaluated; information on the importance of social support and on adapting the home environment was given; <b>home</b> <b>visitors</b> counseled on parental authority, and addressed mothers' self-esteem issues; finally, they helped to find child care, when necessary. Some themes were not addressed or partially addressed: health education, child development, home environment, mother's education plans and personal routine, partner support and play with the child. Other themes were not expected, but found in the case notes: social issues, mother-family relationship, relation with services, couple issues, quality of maternal behavior and child's language development.

Purpose: The {{purpose of the}} current study was first to evaluate the effects of a multicomponent professional development intervention that included two brief workshops plus a six week performance feedback package on the home visitors' use of specific caregiver coaching strategies and range routines utilized during home-based intervention. The second purpose was to examine {{the extent to which the}} home visitors' use of coaching practices related to changes in parent engagement, parental stress, parent self-efficacy, and child developmental progress. An additional secondary purpose was to examine the extent to which <b>home</b> <b>visitors</b> and caregivers reported the professional development and subsequent caregiver coaching to be: (1) acceptable, (2) feasible, and (3) effective in changing practice. Method: A multiple-baseline design across three <b>home</b> <b>visitors</b> and caregiver/child dyads was used to evaluate the effects of workshops plus a performance feedback package on home visitors' use of caregiver coaching strategies and range of routines. The functional relation between the intervention and the dependent variable of the <b>home</b> <b>visitor's</b> use of caregiver coaching strategies was analyzed based on visual inspection using guidelines established by Kratochwill, Hitchcook, Horner, Levin, Odom, Rindskopf, and Shadish, (2010).
