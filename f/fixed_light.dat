5|$|The {{lighthouse}} had two lights; {{the lower}} a fixed white {{light and the}} upper a quick flashing white light, showing every 60 seconds. However, this quick revolution gave the impression it was a <b>fixed</b> <b>light</b> with no flashes detectable. This {{may have contributed to}} the grounding, at Cefn Sidan, of the La Jeune Emma, bound from Martinique to Cherbourg in 1828. 13 of the 19 on board drowned, including Adeline Coquelin, the 12-year-old niece of Napoleon Bonaparte's divorced wife Jos√©phine de Beauharnais.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British forces {{landed on}} the island and told the keeper's wife, Thankful Stone, that they had nothing to fear as long as they kept the light burning. Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} to blow up the lighthouse, and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The light's new characteristic was a <b>fixed</b> <b>light</b> with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is a flash of white light every ten seconds. It continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway.|$|E
25|$|Before the lightstation's {{completion}} and opening, Robert Mills {{cared for the}} temporary <b>fixed</b> <b>light</b> for the previous season.|$|E
60|$|Thus, the Goodwin Sands, {{which are}} upwards of ten miles in length, {{are marked by}} three lightships. The one on the north has three masts and three <b>fixed</b> <b>lights.</b> The one on the south has two masts and two <b>fixed</b> <b>lights.</b> The one that lies between the two--off Ramsgate, and named the Gull--has one mast and one {{revolving}} light.|$|R
25|$|The entire galley/saloon/nav area is {{illuminated}} and ventilated {{by a large}} skylight, five <b>fixed</b> <b>lights,</b> four hatches, overhead lighting, four reading {{lights and}} nighttime courtesy lighting along the floor.|$|R
5|$|The Essex Reef Light {{was first}} lit on July 1, 1889, it {{featured}} a <b>fixed</b> red <b>light</b> until December 15, 1892, {{when it was}} changed to a <b>fixed</b> white <b>light.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was built}} {{of stone and}} brick and intended for one second class keeper. The light, built in 1889, guides {{the entrance to the}} Port of Ponce, as a 6th order red <b>fixed</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
25|$|Then {{in early}} 1842 an {{intermittent}} (flashing) light replaced the <b>fixed</b> <b>light,</b> and a lightship was towed to a station of the Knobben, off Anholt. Around {{the mid-19th century}} {{there was also a}} floating light stationed several miles out from the lighthouse, {{near the end of the}} several miles long reef. This floating light operated from May to December.|$|E
25|$|This {{lighthouse}} {{was planned}} in about 1850 because underwater shoals of massive granite boulders made navigation {{in the area}} dangerous. There are many accounts from the 1800s on of disasters and lost lives {{in this area of}} Lake Huron. The first beacon on the island (1857) was provided by a temporary <b>fixed</b> <b>light</b> which was replaced by the tower. The actual lighthouse was first lit on 1 April 1859. Valuable in its day, it still emits a bright beam, but now, buoys and modern navigational tools are more important for safe navigation.|$|E
50|$|Glazing {{consisted}} of large <b>fixed</b> <b>lights</b> with two small outward-opening lights above a transom; some were top-hinged and others side-hinged to provide alternative ventilation. Entrance doors were single-leaf sliding, and hand operated.|$|R
5000|$|Computer {{stereo vision}} with many cameras under <b>fixed</b> <b>lighting</b> is called {{structure}} from motion. Techniques using a fixed camera and known lighting are called photometric stereo techniques, or [...] "shape from shading".|$|R
50|$|Rufus- Rufus {{is never}} seen, but only {{heard in the}} {{projection}} booth as he runs here and there to <b>fix</b> <b>light</b> bulbs, change projections, alter backdrops, etc. He can be heard {{from time to time}} running backstage, constantly out of breath.|$|R
500|$|At {{the time}} of the opening of the {{lighthouse}} in 1841, a <b>fixed</b> <b>light</b> was emitted by an oil lamp with one wick. The intensity of the light was increased by a combination of a dioptric fixed lens and catoptric mirrors. On 25 April 1843, lighting was upgraded to improve visibility from Sandy Bay, and in 1854, the lighthouse had a reported visibility of [...]|$|E
500|$|There is a {{lighthouse}} at the Dwarka Point on the Dwarka peninsula, {{which provides a}} panoramic view of the city. It is a <b>fixed</b> <b>light</b> situated [...] above the sea level, and the light is visible over a distance of [...] The lighthouse tower is [...] in height and is [...] away from the high water level in the sea. The radio beacon provided on this lighthouse tower is powered by a solar photovoltaic module.|$|E
500|$|The Falkner Island Lighthouse was {{commissioned}} by President Thomas Jefferson in 1802. It was constructed and completed by Abisha Woodward in 1802. Woodward also built New London Harbor Light in 1801 and the Black Rock Harbor Light in 1808. Falkner Island Lighthouse cost $5977.62 to build, according to the United States government. The [...] octagonal tower was made of brownstone lined with brick, and it originally had a spiral wooden staircase that led outside to the lantern room. This staircase was an unusual and distinguishing characteristic of the Falkner Island Light. The original <b>fixed</b> <b>light</b> used twelve lamps and reflectors on two stacked tables. It was replaced in 1840, {{at a cost of}} $2842.00, with a lantern that used nine lamps and sixteen-inch reflectors. A [...] cast iron spiral staircase was installed in a major renovation in 1871.|$|E
50|$|The {{temporary}} lightvessel {{was removed}} on 18 September 1879 and towed to Milford by Vestal. The new light was successfully moored the same day, {{with the latest}} in fog-warning machinery and a revolving light, instead of the two <b>fixed</b> <b>lights</b> on the old vessel.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} entrance {{consists of}} four pairs of deeply recessed bronze and glass doors centrally located on the Vermont Avenue elevation. Above the entry are tall bronze-framed windows with <b>fixed</b> <b>lights,</b> each surrounded by flush black granite panels and separated by three, two-story granite piers. Projecting limestone frames surround the third-story windows aligned above the entrance.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>fixed</b> and {{flashing}} <b>light,</b> abbreviated [...] "F. Fl", {{is a light}} in which a <b>fixed</b> low intensity <b>light</b> is combined with a flashing high intensity light.|$|R
2500|$|The earliest, {{and still}} the cheapest, barcode {{scanners}} are built from a <b>fixed</b> <b>light</b> and a single photosensor that is manually [...] "scrubbed" [...] across the barcode.|$|E
2500|$|In waters {{too deep}} for a {{conventional}} structure, a lightship {{might be used}} instead of a lighthouse, such as the former lightship Columbia. [...] Most of these have now been replaced by <b>fixed</b> <b>light</b> platforms (such as Ambrose Light) {{similar to those used}} for offshore oil exploration.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{only thing}} I {{remember}} {{was a sort}} of green light--very clouded, very dim--which came up from the well. Not a <b>fixed</b> <b>light,</b> but intermittent and irregular--quite unlike anything I had ever seen." ...|$|E
25|$|In 1857 a 4th order Fresnel lens {{producing}} a <b>fixed</b> white <b>light</b> was installed.|$|R
50|$|For {{engineering}} drawings a freestanding open {{steel structure}} is often provided. A camera may be moved vertically on a track. Drawings {{are placed on}} a large table for filming, with centres under the lens. <b>Fixed</b> <b>lights</b> illuminate the copy. These cameras are often over 4 metres (10 feet) high. These cameras accept roll film stock of 35 or 16 mm.|$|R
5000|$|In 1910 {{the lights}} were {{replaced}} by <b>fixed</b> <b>lights.</b> Their function survives, in modern form, as lights on skeleton towers, both with the characteristic Quick Flashing Green, numbers [...] "151" [...] and [...] "155", Light List numbers 2-12705 and 2-12735. The coordinates shown are for light 151 which is actually in the river. The original light was on the bank to the south.|$|R
60|$|King Media's slumbers {{were like}} the helmed sentry's in the saddle. From them, he started like an antlered deer, {{bursting}} from out a copse. Some said he never slept; that deep within himself he but intensified the hour; or, leaving his crowned brow in marble quiet, unseen, departed to far-off councils of the gods. Howbeit, his lids never closed; in the noonday sun, those crystal eyes, like diamonds, sparkled with a <b>fixed</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
60|$|Simultaneously {{with the}} ascent of the Gull light there arose {{out of the}} sea three bright stars on the nor'-eastern horizon, and another star in the south-west. The first were the three fixed lights of the {{lightship}} that marked the North sandhead; the latter was the <b>fixed</b> <b>light</b> that guarded the South sandhead. The Goodwin sentinels were now placed for the night, and the commerce of the world might come and go, and pass those dreaded shoals, in absolute security.|$|E
60|$|Another mode of holophotally {{producing}} the intermittent light {{has been suggested}} by my father, and is shown in Fig. 5. It consists of alternate and opposite sectors of dioptric spherical mirror, MM, and of Fresnel's <b>fixed</b> <b>light</b> apparatus, AA. By the revolution of this composite frame about the burner, the same immediate alternation of light and darkness is produced, the first when {{the front of the}} fixed panel, and the second when the back of the mirror, is presented to the eye of the sailor.|$|E
5000|$|We know, also, that {{multiple}} lights were {{a feature of}} many locations before occulting lights arrived to give a station clear identity at night. The Cornwall Tourist Board website says: [...] "Trinity House built a two coal fired station (at the Lizard)... The signal continued as two <b>fixed</b> <b>lights</b> until 1903... in 1903 the two tower system was stopped and a single flashing light used." ...|$|R
2500|$|During his career, he {{made friends}} with artists and intellectuals such as Salvador Novo, Diego Rivera, Fernando Ben√≠tez, Frida Kahlo, Octavio Paz, Alberto Gironella, Carlos Monsiv√°is and Jos√© Luis Cuevas along with {{entertainment}} stars such as Pedro Infante, Mar√≠a F√©lix, Tin Tan and Tongolele [...] However, {{he said that he}} never considered himself as an artist or intellectual. He never had or wanted his own studio with <b>fixed</b> <b>lights</b> and screens.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Lightvessel {{was stationed}} {{on the bank}} in 1848, its position being 1.25 nautical miles southeast of the southeast tail of the bank at position [...] The lightvessel's lighting consisted of two <b>fixed</b> <b>lights</b> with an operational coverage of 10 nautical miles. The original vessel was not fitted with a fog horn, instead a gun mounted onboard was fired during periods of low visibility {{as a warning to}} shipping.|$|R
60|$|In Fig. 1, AAA {{represents}} in plan {{an ordinary}} Fresnel's dioptric <b>fixed</b> <b>light</b> apparatus, and BB' a hemispherical mirror (either metallic or dioptric on my father's principle) {{which is made}} to revolve with uniform speed about the burner. This mirror, it is obvious, intercepts the rays of one hemisphere, and, returning them through the flame (less loss by absorption, etc.), spreads them equally over the other. In this way 180¬∞ of light pass regularly {{the eye of the}} seaman; and are followed at once by 180¬∞ of darkness. As the hemispherical mirror begins to open, the observer receives the full light, since the whole lit hemisphere is illuminated with strict equality; and as it closes again, he passes into darkness.|$|E
60|$|The {{necessity}} for marked characteristics in coast illumination increases {{with the number}} of lights. The late Mr. Robert Stevenson, my grandfather, contributed two distinctions, which he called respectively the intermittent and the flashing light. It is only to the former of these that I have to refer in the present paper. The intermittent light was first introduced at Tarbetness in 1830, and is already in use at eight stations on the coasts of the United Kingdom. As constructed originally, it was an arrangement by which a <b>fixed</b> <b>light</b> was alternately eclipsed and revealed. These recurrent occultations and revelations produce an effect totally {{different from that of the}} revolving light, which comes gradually into its full strength, and as gradually fades away. The changes in the intermittent, on the other hand, are immediate; a certain duration of darkness is followed at once and without the least gradation by a certain period of light. The arrangement employed by my grandfather to effect this object consisted of two opaque cylindric shades or extinguishers, one of which descended from the roof, while the other ascended from below to meet it, at a fixed interval. The light was thus entirely intercepted.|$|E
60|$|This {{necessity}} {{opened his}} eyes to the fundamental changes of the world. Of his past only the familiar names remained, here and there, but the things and the men, as he had known them, were gone. The name of Gardner, Patteson, & Co. was still displayed on the walls of warehouses by the waterside, on the brass plates and window-panes in the business quarters of more than one Eastern port, but there was no longer a Gardner or a Patteson in the firm. There was no longer for Captain Whalley an arm-chair and a welcome in the private office, with a bit of business ready to be put in the way of an old friend, for the sake of bygone services. The husbands of the Gardner girls sat behind the desks in that room where, long after he had left the employ, he had kept his right of entrance in the old man's time. Their ships now had yellow funnels with black tops, and a time-table of appointed routes like a confounded service of tramways. The winds of December and June were all one to them; their captains (excellent young men he doubted not) were, to be sure, familiar with Whalley Island, because of late years the Government had established a white <b>fixed</b> <b>light</b> on the north end (with a red danger sector over the Condor Reef), but most of them would have been extremely surprised to hear that a flesh-and-blood Whalley still existed--an old man going about the world trying to pick up a cargo here and there for his little bark.|$|E
60|$|When {{they reached}} Brill they located {{the man they}} were after <b>fixing</b> a <b>light</b> {{in one of the}} halls.|$|R
30|$|The major {{difficulty}} {{arises from}} the fact that the problem is under-constrained, i.e., there are many solutions that satisfy the image formation model. In other words, there exists a set of shapes that yields exactly the same shading appearance under a <b>fixed</b> <b>lighting</b> condition. To overcome this issue, previous approaches incorporate additional priors, such as the smoothness constraint [13]. With such priors, it has been shown that the shape-from-shading problem can be better constrained.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fixed</b> task <b>lighting</b> {{refers to}} a {{non-movable}} light source dedicated to lighting a specific task. In kitchens, a homeowner may install several recessed [...] "can" [...] lights or under cabinet lighting to provide clear lighting onto the counters for cutting and preparing food. Having proper lighting when working with sharp knives is {{a critical component of}} injury prevention. Another form of <b>fixed</b> task <b>lighting</b> may simply be a table lamp positioned over one's reading chair.|$|R
