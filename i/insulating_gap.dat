50|$|Eddy {{currents}} generate {{resistive losses}} that transform {{some forms of}} energy, such as kinetic energy, into heat. This Joule heating reduces efficiency of iron-core transformers and electric motors and other devices that use changing magnetic fields. Eddy currents are minimized in these devices by selecting magnetic core materials that have low electrical conductivity (e.g., ferrites) or by using thin sheets of magnetic material, known as laminations. Electrons cannot cross the <b>insulating</b> <b>gap</b> between the laminations and so are unable to circulate on wide arcs. Charges gather at the lamination boundaries, in a process analogous to the Hall effect, producing electric fields that oppose any further accumulation of charge and hence suppressing the eddy currents. The shorter the distance between adjacent laminations (i.e., the greater the number of laminations per unit area, perpendicular to the applied field), the greater the suppression of eddy currents.|$|E
5000|$|An {{electrical}} contact is an electrical circuit component found in electrical switches, relays, connectors and circuit breakers. Each contact {{is a piece}} of electrically conductive material, usually metal. When a pair of contacts touch, they can pass an electrical current with a certain contact resistance, dependent on surface structure, surface chemistry and contact time; when the pair is separated by an <b>insulating</b> <b>gap,</b> then the pair does not pass a current. When the contacts touch, the switch is [...] "closed"; when the contacts are separated, the switch is [...] "open". The gap must be an insulating medium such as air, vacuum, oil, SF6 or other electrically insulating fluid. Contacts may be operated by humans in push-buttons and switches, by mechanical pressure in sensors or machine cams, and electromechanically in relays. The surfaces where contacts touch are usually composed of metals such as silver or gold alloys that have high electrical conductivity, wear resistance, oxidation resistance and other properties.

40|$|Phase {{transitions}} in the Hubbard model and ionic Hubbard model at half-filling on the honeycomb lattice are investigated {{in the strong}} coupling perturbation theory which corresponds to an expansion in powers of the hopping t around the atomic limit. Within this formulation we find analytic expressions for the single-particle spectrum, whereby the calculation of the <b>insulating</b> <b>gap</b> is reduced to a simple root finding problem. This enables high precision determination of the <b>insulating</b> <b>gap</b> that does not require any extrapolation procedure. The critical value of Mott transition on the honeycomb lattice is obtained to be U_c≈ 2. 38 t. Studying the ionic Hubbard model at the lowest order, we find two insulating states, one with Mott character at large U and another with single-particle gap character at large ionic potential, Δ. The present approach gives a critical gapless state at U= 2 Δ at lowest order. By systematically improving on the perturbation expansion, the density of states around this critical gapless phase reduces. Comment: 14 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

40|$|Determining {{the origin}} of the <b>insulating</b> <b>gap</b> in the monoclinic V O 2 (M 1) is a long-standing issue. The {{difficulty}} of this study arises from the simultaneous occurrence of structural and electronic transitions upon thermal cycling. Here, we compare the electronic structure of the M 1 phase with that of single crystalline insulating V O 2 (A) and V O 2 (B) thin films to better understand the insulating phase of VO 2. As these A and B phases do not undergo a structural transition upon thermal cycling, we comparatively study {{the origin of}} the gap opening in the insulating VO 2 phases. By x-ray absorption and optical spectroscopy, we find that the shift of unoccupied t 2 g orbitals away from the Fermi level is a common feature, which plays an important role for the insulating behavior in VO 2 polymorphs. The distinct splitting of the half-filled t 2 g orbital is observed only in the M 1 phase, widening the bandgap up to ∼ 0. 6 eV.

We compare several degrees of nonlocality by adjusting the cluster momentum. The iterated perturbation theory is adopted as an impurity solver, and then a comparison with the noncrossing approximation is presented.

We use computer simulations to calculate the single-electron and electron pair density of states at different values of the superconducting gap Δ, and we identify "triptych" symmetries and scaling relations between them.

40|$|We {{assess the}} {{reliability}} of the one-crossing approximation (OCA) approach in quantitative description of the Mott transition in the framework of the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The OCA approach has been applied in the conjunction with DMFT to a number of heavy-fermion, actinide, transition metal compounds, and nanoscale systems. However, several recent studies in the framework of impurity models pointed out to serious deficiencies of OCA and raised questions regarding its reliability. Here we consider a single band Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice at finite temperatures and compare the results of OCA to those of a numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method. The temperature-local repulsion U phase diagram for the particle-hole symmetric case obtained by OCA is in good agreement with that of QMC, with the metal-insulator transition captured very well. We find, however, that the insulator to metal transition is shifted to higher values of U and, simultaneously, correlations in the metallic phase are significantly overestimated. This counter-intuitive behavior is due to simultaneous underestimations of the Kondo scale in the metallic phase {{and the size of the}} <b>insulating</b> <b>gap.</b> We trace the underestimation of the <b>insulating</b> <b>gap</b> to that of the second moment of the high-frequency expansion of the impurity spectral density.
