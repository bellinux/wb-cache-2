5|$|The British Rail Class 47 is a {{class of}} British railway <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> that was {{developed}} in the 1960s by Brush Traction. A total of 512 Class 47s were built at Crewe Works and Brush's Falcon Works, Loughborough between 1962 and 1968, which made them the most numerous class of British mainline diesel locomotive.|$|E

The train consists of an Amfleet I business class car, an Amfleet I cafe car, an Amfleet I coach, and three Amfleet II long-distance coach cars. Motive power is usually a Genesis <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> west of Philadelphia.

5|$|The Caltrain Modernization Program (CalMod) is a $1.9billion {{project that}} will add a {{positive}} train control (PTC) system and electrify {{the main line}} of the U.S. commuter railroad Caltrain, which serves cities in the San Francisco Peninsula and Silicon Valley, as well as transition from its current <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> powered trains to electric multiple units (EMU). According to Caltrain, electrification of the tracks will allow it to improve service times via faster acceleration and shorter headways, reduce air pollution and noise, and facilitate a future railway tunnel (the Downtown Rail Extension) into downtown San Francisco's Transbay Transit Center (as diesel trains cannot serve underground stations).|$|E

25|$|A key {{assumption}} of Aickin's report was that {{traffic on the}} NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{was in fact a}} travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.|$|E
25|$|A diesel–electric locomotive's {{power output}} is {{independent}} of road speed, {{as long as the}} unit's generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit's ability to develop tractive effort (also referred to as drawbar pull or tractive force, which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal design considerations that had to be solved in early <b>diesel–electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.|$|E
25|$|On 12 June 2014, 12 {{years to}} the day after the crash, Lewis's death was commemorated by a flypast over Swanage station by a Lynx from RNAS Yeovilton, and the {{renaming}} of the preserved British Rail Class 33 <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> No. D6515 to Lt Jenny Lewis RN. Lewis was a fan of the class. The locomotive was used to haul trains between London and Corfe Castle and Swanage in 1966, and the 77-tonne locomotive was recently overhauled to mainline standards. Lewis's father became a major shareholder in the overhaul project after her death.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of dissolved magnesium chloride {{in the well}} water (bore water) used in locomotive boilers on the Trans-Australian Railway caused serious and expensive maintenance problems during the steam era. At no point along its route does the line cross a permanent fresh water watercourse, so bore water had to be relied on. No inexpensive treatment for the highly mineralised water was available and locomotive boilers were lasting {{less than a quarter}} of the time normally expected. In the days of steam locomotion, about half the total train load was water for the engine. The line's operator, Commonwealth Railways was an early adopter of the <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
25|$|At Camden, the MCSA {{connected}} to an extensive network of private W.T. Carter Company rail lines {{that were used}} to transport freshly cut timber from remote logging camps to the sawmill. Starting in the 1940s, these rail lines were gradually phased out as the lumber company made increasing use of trucks for timber extraction. Since the lumber company owned both rail operations, this process made plenty of surplus W.T. Carter steam locomotives available for use by the MCSA, delaying the onset of dieselization. The MCSA would not obtain its first <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> until 1960 and still used steam power until 1965, one of the last common-carrier railroads in Texas to do so.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} PA, the model 244 diesel prime mover {{proved to be}} the undoing of the FA, and the {{locomotives}} failed to capture a marketplace dominated by General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD). The later 251-series engine, a vastly improved prime mover, was not available in time for ALCO to recover the loss of reputation caused by the unreliability of the 244, which was a key factor in the dissolution of the partnership with GE. By the time the ALCO 251 engine was accepted into widespread use, General Electric had launched their own entries into the <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> market, notably the U25B. General Electric eventually supplanted ALCO as a manufacturer of locomotives, leading to ALCO's exit from the locomotive market in 1969.|$|E
50|$|From the mid-1970s, steam was {{replaced}} by Class 91-000 <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> on the SAR's longer routes, which were more powerful.

Therefore, the SAR decided to transfer the NG G13 and NG G16 Garratts to the Alfred County Railway in Natal.|$|R
