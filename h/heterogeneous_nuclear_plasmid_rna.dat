40|$|The {{structure}} of {{one member of}} a family of maize mitochondrial RNA replicons (or <b>RNA</b> <b>plasmids),</b> <b>RNA</b> b, has been characterized. It is shown that RNA b shares a 13 nucleotide sequence with the central conserved region of Cadang-Cadang viroid of coconuts which might be involved in substrate recognition by the RNA replicase during replication. RNA b likely was derived from a larger member in that family, RNA a, through co-linear deletions similar to those involved with the generation of the defective interfering (DI) elements associated with both animal and plant viruses. RNA b may represent a "selfish" RNA optimized for replication as it does not have the capacity to encode its own replicase. Mitochondrial <b>RNA</b> <b>plasmids</b> have been found not to be restricted to the S and RU cytoplasms, as previously reported. Related <b>plasmid</b> <b>RNAs</b> have been detected in maize plants with C, N and T cytoplasms as well as 13 Latin American races. They were not found, however, in teosintes, indicating that the ancestral nucleic acid from which these RNAs evolved was acquired soon after the split between teosintes and maize, before the divergence of the maize races. Distribution of the <b>plasmid</b> <b>RNAs,</b> a maize mRNA (atp 6), and a mitochondrial rRNA (26 S) in different organs and tissues was investigated by in situ hybridization. These results indicated that mitochondrial gene expression is subjected to an unexpected degree of both spatial and developmental regulation, and that individual mitochondrial genes are subjected to different controls. Similar results were obtained in in situ hybridization studies of Brassica floral buds. Both studies suggested that the levels of mitochondrial genes transcripts are not particularly high in the tapetal cells of both maize and Brassica anthers contrary to common belief.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The nuclear {{envelope}} that encloses the nucleus {{is a significant}} barrier to non-viral vectors and shrouds {{the relationship between the}} trafficking of plasmid DNA to the nucleus and expression of an encoded transgene. Here, we use a novel single cell approach to quantify <b>nuclear</b> import of <b>plasmid</b> DNA following non-viral transfection and correlate this with reporter gene expression. METHODS: Through the fractionation of intact nuclei from HeLa cells, the intranuclear copy number of plasmid DNA was quantified after transfection with either polyethylenimine (PEI) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (LFA). Importantly, the use of a reporter protein that is incorporated into chromatin and retained in isolated nuclei permits analysis of gene expression by flow cytometry to be compared with <b>nuclear</b> <b>plasmid</b> delivery. RESULTS: PEI was found to mediate a greater and more rapid <b>nuclear</b> accumulation of <b>plasmid</b> DNA compared to LFA, but reporter gene expression was shown to be higher for LFA than PEI when an equivalent number of plasmids were in the nucleus. Sorting of the extracted nuclei according to the level of reporter expression demonstrated that reporter expression was dependent upon the number of plasmids delivered into the nucleus, with both threshold and saturation in expression evident with few or many <b>nuclear</b> <b>plasmids.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate formally that although the efficiency of <b>plasmid</b> <b>nuclear</b> delivery is a critical determinant of the level of transgene expression, intranuclear events also influence the transcriptional activity of the transgene, and must be taken into consideration when attempting to maximize the efficiency of non-viral vectors.
