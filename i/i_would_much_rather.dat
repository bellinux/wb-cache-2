5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
2500|$|Churchill {{told the}} Irish Ambassador to London in 1946, [...] "I {{said a few}} words in {{parliament}} the other day about your country because I still hope for a united Ireland. You must get those fellows in the north in, though; you can't do it by force. There is not, and never was, any bitterness in my heart towards your country." [...] He later said [...] "You know I have had many invitations to visit Ulster but I have refused them all. I don't {{want to go there}} at all, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> go to southern Ireland. Maybe I'll buy another horse with an entry in the Irish Derby." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the album}} was {{completed}} in August 1981, its release was delayed {{for a whole year}} until the group felt ready to release it. Gartside defended the decision to hold back the album, saying that [...] "we could have released it then, and it would probably have got some nice reviews, sold a few thousand copies and disappeared. But we thought that if we held on to it, put out 'The [...] "Sweetest Girl"', built on that a bit, took some more singles off the album, built up the interest and then put it out, it would do a lot more. Seeing as we were really pleased with it, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> that happened." ...|$|E
60|$|ANNYS Perhaps I'm {{not going}} to win. [She goes to him, smiling.] I hope you'll win. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> so <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> you won.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, and it {{was very}} good, uncle; but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> have gone without it than shoot the beaver the tail belonged to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are absurd," [...] she declared, [...] "and {{you must}} go away. Really! The Baroness will be home directly. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> {{that she did not}} find you here." ...|$|R
2500|$|Carnegie {{was tried}} on 2 August 1728 for premeditated murder, a charge {{supported}} by [...] "long arguments and quotations of authority," [...] as was common at that time. The accused man swore that as God was his witness {{he had no}} grudge against the earl, but instead he had had the greatest kindness and respect for him. [...] "If it shall appear," [...] he had said, [...] "that I was the unlucky person who wounded the earl, I protest before God <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> that a sword had been sheathed in my own bowels." [...] He did not admit his guilt except to say: [...] "I had the misfortune that day to be mortally drunk, for which I beg God’s pardon." [...] Carnegie said that in this state he did not remember seeing the earl {{when he came out}} of the ditch.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1996 Skunkhour {{embarked}} on a 10-week tour of Europe. However, by March they had written only one new song for their third album, which bothered Aya: [...] "I was saying to Del that we've really got to get going on this new stuff. We might lose momentum if we don't keep creating. So I [...] 'What have you got, man?' And he said, 'Mate, I've got nothing'. He'd been saying {{for a couple of}} years that he wasn't sure this is what he was meant to do. He didn't feel like a rapper any more. He didn't feel like a lyricist any more. He wanted to go back to his artwork, which is his first love. I said, 'I understand. You should leave the band'". Del completed the tour, then quit to become an in-house artist at Walt Disney Animation Studios in Australia. Aya told Dino Scatena of The Daily Telegraph that [...] "What was best for him was best for us because his malaise might permeate the band and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> he leave and we be strong and revitalised rather than try to perpetuate an old chemistry that wasn't working".|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} can do as you like, Charlotte," [...] Eleanor said feebly; [...] "but for my part <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> go on as we are. We don't know now that the will really exists, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> go on {{thinking}} {{that there is a}} doubt about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I {{have large}} {{discretionary}} powers. We {{have a very}} strong branch over on this side, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> induce you to stay here without applying to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A woman's fears only, dear," [...] she admitted, as {{she gave}} him her hands. [...] "Why did nature make my sex pessimists and yours optimists, <b>I</b> wonder? <b>I</b> <b>would</b> so <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> look towards the sun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everyone to his taste, Matteo. For my part, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> {{have been}} at work here all night {{watching}} the cargo got in and checking it off, than have been standing about doing nothing in the palace." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{with that}} answer he left me. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> he had knocked me down.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; my {{suggestion}} was really generous, because <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> you both remained and saw Mr. Prescott proved innocent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> stay here. Every {{one would}} be strange to me, and {{having nothing to do}} I should feel in the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am ready}} now," [...] she said, {{standing}} up, [...] "but must {{we go to}} Dorchester House? <b>I</b> <b>would</b> so <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> go straight home. I have not had {{such a good time}} since I have been in London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't do that," [...] Mark said; [...] "the coffer {{contains}} gems {{worth over}} 50,000 pounds, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> it remained in your keeping until I {{decide what to}} do with it. How large is it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|We all {{applauded the}} neat touch, but the Altrurian eagerly entreated: [...] "No, no; {{never mind that}} now. That {{is a matter of}} {{comparatively}} little interest. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> so <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> know something about the status of the working-man among you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ludlow said, [...] "Why, I think Mrs. Rangeley is right. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> {{yield to}} compulsion. I don't mind telling what kept me, if I'm obliged to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I suppose I must do it, though <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> not. Still, as you say, it {{were best}} {{to get it all}} over at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Otter," [...] {{said the}} voice with a ghastly attempt at a laugh, [...] "but if {{it is all the}} same, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> that you came alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see {{why they}} shouldn't share the storm," [...] he mused. [...] "He's small, but he looks as though he might be awkward. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> Martello {{and the others were}} here; Martello is a strong man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{very kind}} of you, Mr. Greene," [...] he acknowledged, [...] "but do you know <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> not talk {{business}} with any one while I am on the steamer? I am a little overworked and I need the rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{long as you}} do {{not take}} him from me, I will not grudge you his company," [...] Mr. Foley remarked, rising. [...] "On the other hand, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> that you made your bow to my niece to-night than went to Maxendorf." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel that}} it is my duty to go, Miss Armstrong. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> stay, I can assure you, but it's {{possible}} some of the garrisons may be holding out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> not," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "and besides, I {{think for}} to-day I would rather sit quiet {{and think it}} all over and realize how happy I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let me get out, then; and pray, pray {{take the}} carriage. I would much sooner do {{anything}} than go in it. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> walk. I {{am sure you}} will be ill!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should feel}} uncomfortable myself," [...] Reuben said, [...] "even if I didn't make other people uncomfortable. So I think that, with all {{gratitude}} for the offer, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> remain as I am. Accustomed as I have been to hard work, during my apprenticeship, the life here appears to be exceedingly easy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, {{the general}} did not say; but for myself, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> join the regiment. Staff {{appointment}} sounds tempting, but I {{must say that}} I should greatly prefer regimental work; especially as I should be very much junior to the other officers of the staff, and should feel myself out of place among them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not think}} that I am a prude," [...] she said. [...] "You can kiss me if you like, and yet <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> that you did not. I do not know why. I like you well enough, and {{certainly}} it is not from any sense of right or wrong. I am like Andrea in that way. I make my own laws. To-night I do not wish you to kiss me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} for the compliment, good sir," [...] replied the doctor, with a smile; [...] "still <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> see you play cards than hear you talk scandal, as you {{sometimes}} do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be {{that this}} armour will be useful, {{on the day of}} battle," [...] Philip said; [...] "but at present it seems to me, Francois, that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> be without it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{just to the}} miller's marriage,' {{answered}} the bear carelessly. 'Of course, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> stay at home, but the miller was so anxious I should be there that I really could not refuse.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so too," [...] {{the captain}} said. [...] "I grant that a spell of such weather {{as we have}} been favoured with is apt to become a little monotonous, and I {{generally}} find my passengers have a tendency after a time to become snappish and quarrelsome from sheer want of anything to occupy their minds. Still <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> put up with that than with the chances of a storm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{says that}} he made a promise? You have never heard {{anything}} of the kind from me. Papa, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> so <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> not talk about Llanfeare. Ever since I have known him, Uncle Indefer has been all love to me. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not allow a thought of mine to be polluted by ingratitude towards him. Whatever he has done, he has done because he has thought it to be the best. Perhaps I ought to tell you that he has made some charge on the property on my behalf, which will prevent my being a burden upon you." ...|$|R
60|$|To the English traveller, {{the foreign}} waiter {{in the earlier}} stages of his career is a burden and a trial. When he is complete--when he really can talk English I rejoice in him. When I object to him is when his English is worse than my French or German, and when he will, for his own {{educational}} purposes, insist, nevertheless, that the conversation shall be entirely in English. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{he came to me}} some other time. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> so <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> make it after dinner or, say, the next morning. I hate giving lessons during meal times.|$|R
