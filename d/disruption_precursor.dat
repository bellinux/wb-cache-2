40|$|OAK-B 135 A path to {{sustained}} stable operation, at {{plasma pressure}} up to twice the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) n = 1 free-boundary pressure limit, {{has been discovered}} in the DIII-D tokamak. Tuning the correction of the intrinsic magnetic field asymmetries so as to minimize plasma rotation decay during the high beta phase and increasing the angular momentum injection, have allowed maintaining the plasma rotation above that needed for stabilization of the resistive wall mode (RWM). A new method to determine the improved magnetic field correction uses feedback to sense and minimize the resonant plasma response to the non-axisymmetric field. At twice the free-boundary pressure limit, a <b>disruption</b> <b>precursor</b> is observed, {{which is consistent with}} having reached the ''ideal wall'' pressure limit predicted by stability calculations...|$|E

This frequently observed precursor is detected by realtime cross-correlation of two radially separated channels of the heterodyne electron cyclotron emission diagnostic. An electronic module developed to detect the precursor and its functionality is briefly described. A disruption statistic for TEXTOR is presented, from which the probability of the occurrence of the m/n = 2 / 1 mode is seen. A method to generate reproducible disruption precursors at TEXTOR is also presented. Experiments to avoid disruptions by inducing toroidal velocity shear by tangential neutral beam injection and mitigate disruptions by He-puffing are presented. In the experiments performed, up to 50 % of the disruptions could be avoided. Furthermore, calculations of the precursor frequency and its evolution are described and compared with measurements...|$|E
40|$|MHD {{phenomena}} in reversed shear plasmas in TFTR are described during {{each of the}} three phases of the evolution of these discharges: the current ramp, high power neutral beam heating and after the beam power has been reduced. Theoretical analysis of discharges which disrupted in the high-{beta} phase indicates that the {beta} - limit is set by the ideal n = 1 infernal/kink mode. The mode structure of the <b>disruption</b> <b>precursor</b> reconstructed from the electron temperature data compares favorably with the predicted displacement vector from the ideal MHD model. In contrast, disruptions during the early and late phases are due to resistive instabilities, double tearing modes coupled to high-m edge modes. The resistive interchange mode, predicted to be unstable in reversed shear plasmas, is not seen in the experiment. Neo-classical tearing mode theory is shown to describe the non-disruptive MHD phenomena. A nonlinear resistive MHD simulation reproduces off-axis sawtooth-like crashes during the post-beam phase. The dependence of the {beta}-limit on the pressure peakedness and q{sub min} is discussed, showing a path to stable higher-{beta} regimes...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{characteristics}} of high+, low-q disruptions {{have been studied}} in PBX-M, a device with a nearby conducting shell. The coupling between {{the wall and the}} plasma was varied by choosing different plasma shapes, including nearly circular plasmas, D-shaped plasmas and bean-shaped plasmas (indented on the midplane), and by increasing the effective coverage of the plasma by the shell. <b>Disruption</b> <b>precursors</b> were observed to have a strong dependence on the coupling between the plasma and the shell. Measured mode growth times vary from between several times the AlfvCn time-scale (- 100 p s) to the LIR time-scale of the wall (- 20 ms). The behaviour of observed <b>disruption</b> <b>precursors</b> is interpreted in terms of the resistive wall mode theory of ideal plasmas, and a detailed calculation of the stability of a strongly coupled bean configuration using the NOVA-W linear stability code is presented. The experimental observations are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. 1...|$|R

40|$|Because of {{the good}} {{agreement}} between theory and experiment (on a number of tokamak experiments) on the nonlinear development, saturation of neoclassical tearing modes (NTMs), the study of NTMs is becoming a mature subject. Thus, our contributions to studies of neoclassical (and regular classical) tearing modes {{over the past year}} have focused on a number of particular, more detailed issues: flow shear effects on linear tearing modes, exploring the possibility of NTMs in spherical tokamaks such as NSTX, assisting with classical tearing mode explorations in DIII-D, and fast ion effects on NTMs. In addition, a collaboration with the Institute for Plasma Research group in India was initiated due to their interest in using the NEAR code (developed in part under this grant) to explore neoclassical tearing modes. Finally, a number of talks have been given on basic, current frontier and future extensions of neoclassical tearing mode theory. Our previous identification of the <b>disruption</b> <b>precursor</b> in DIII-D shot 87009 as being due to a global ideal MHD interchange-type instability being driven slowly though its threshold was featured prominently in the DIII-D MHD theory paper at the 2000 IAEA Sorrento meeting. We have also stimulated the application of the NIMROD code to this particular DIII-D <b>disruption</b> <b>precursor</b> and continued to support this code exploration of it. To facilitate quicker evaluations of global-type ideal MHD growth rates and eigenmodes, we have continued our development of a new method for using perturbed equilibria to ''maneuver in delta-W'' space. Since this basic concept for efficiently finding trends in ideal MHD stability using perturbed equilibria has been proven using a screw-pinch geometry, we are now beginning to implement and test the procedure in the GAT 0 code for specific DIII-D high beta equilibria. In addition, to analytically explore the ultimate nonlinear evolution of these types of modes, we have begun (primarily on our DOE ''Nonlinear and Nonideal MHD'' theory grant) exploring the growth rate and eigenmode structure of localized interchange instabilities. A surprising aspect of that work is that robust, ideal MHD-like growth rates and radially spread eigenmodes are only obtained when the Suydam/Mercier criteria are exceeded by about a factor of two (D{sub I} > 0. 45). A new issue we have begun exploring is how ''thin, isolated'' magnetic islands and their effects can be incorporated into MHD equilibria and hence the EFIT code. In addition, we have given presentations on more general fusion, and MHD topics, which have included some of the results developed under this research grant...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The use of ECRH {{has been}} {{investigated}} as a promising technique to avoid or postpone disruptions in dedicated experiments in FTU and ASDEX Upgrade. Disruptions have been produced by injecting Mo through laser blow-off (FTU) or by puffing deuterium gas above the Greenwald limit (FTU and ASDEX Upgrade). The toroidal magnetic field is kept fixed and the ECRH launching mirrors are steered before every discharge in order to change the deposition radius. The loop voltage signal is used as <b>disruption</b> <b>precursor</b> to trigger the ECRH power before the plasma current quench. In the FTU experiments (Ip= 0. 35 - 0. 5 MA, Bt= 5. 3 T, PECRH= 0. 4 - 1. 2 MW) {{it is found that}} the application of ECRH modifies the current quench starting time depending on the power deposition location. A scan in deposition location has shown that the direct heating of one of the magnetic islands produced by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes (either m/n= 3 / 2, 2 / 1 or 3 / 1) prevents its further growth and also produces the stabilization of the other coupled modes and current quench delay or avoidance. Disruption avoidance and complete discharge recovery is obtained when the ECRH power is applied on rational surfaces. The modes involved in the disruption are found to be tearing modes stabilized by a strong local ECRH heating. The Rutherford equation has been used to reproduce the evolution of the MHD modes. The minimum absorbed power value found for disruption avoidance is 0. 4 MW at 0. 5 MA with deposition on the q= 2 surface. In the similar set of experiments carried out in ASDEX Upgrade L-mode plasmas (Ip= 0. 6 MA, Bt= 2. 5 T, PECRH...|$|E
40|$|Neoclassical tearing modes {{have now}} entered the {{mainstream}} of tokamak research. One indication of this was the featuring {{of it in the}} ITER MHD instabilities paper at the 1998 Yokohama meeting, of which we (along with many colleagues throughout the world) were co-authors. In addition, this past year a number of talks were given on various aspects of neoclassical tearing modes and their impacts in tokamak plasmas. At present, we are anxiously awaiting the DIII-D electron cyclotron heating and current drive feedback experiments to see if neoclassical tearing modes can be stabilized according to our theoretical model, or if the theory needs to be modified. A major question in the application of neoclassical tearing mode theory to realistic aspect ratio toroidal plasmas such as DIII-D is: what is the effect of shear in the toroidal flow velocity on toroidicity-induced mode coupling? Both differential rotation between surfaces and flow shear at the rational surfaces can be important both in determining the linear growth rates of tearing modes and in the nonlinear excitation of tearing modes induced by sawtooth crashes. To explore these effects we have been developing an efficient new code NEAR that is based on the FAR code and the Generalized Reduced MHD (GRMHD) equations. The primary work this year has been on running tearing mode and 1 / 1 resistive kink mode benchmark cases against the full FAR and reduced FAR codes. After correcting some coding, the NEAR code {{has been shown to be}} more accurate than the reduced FAR code, and much faster and at least as accurate as the full FAR code. A summary of these results and plans for using the NEAR and NIMROD codes to explore DIII-D type plasmas over the next year are summarized. This past year our joint paper on the <b>disruption</b> <b>precursor</b> model for L-mode NCS high beta DIII-D plasmas was published. This work has also been used to buttress the validity of the application of the ideal MHD instability model to DIII-D and tokamak burning plasmas. In this model ideal MHD instabilities are driven slowly through their instability threshold. Then, the instability grows linearly as exp(t{sup 3 / 2 }) until the magnetic topology of the equilibrium plus perturbation begins to overlap. A code was developed to implement this model using the GATO linear eigenmode structure to try to ascertain the radial region of the plasma where the model first breaks down and the plasma disruption begins; unfortunately, while it seemed that the breakdown may have been occurring first at the edge, neither the ECE signals nor magnetic topology calculations were accurate enough to derive a firm conclusion. Finally, because of the need for investigating ideal MHD instability and growth rates and eigenmode structure in the vicinity of the instability threshold and the fact that well-resolved GATO runs take a lot of computer time, we have begun exploring an idea put forth by Steve Cowley some years ago to determine these changes perturbatively in delta-W space...|$|E

The observed profiles of the radial displacement associated with the MHD modes {{were consistent with the}} displacement profiles expected from the ideal MHD external kink mode. The observed mode frequencies differ from the plasma toroidal rotation frequency measured with CVI charge-exchange recombination light. The independence of the mode frequency from the plasma rotation frequency supports the ideal MHD hypothesis. Possible causes of the frequency difference are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Studies of neoclassical tearing modes have {{remained}} the dominant {{area of research}} on this grant. This year articles and reports on our previous research projects in collaboration with GA colleagues on a new nonlinear tearing mode model, seed island excitation from geometrically coupled perturbations, the combination of flow shear and viscosity on magnetic islands, and ITER projections got published. A major new theoretical achievement by our group was the development of generalized reduced MHD equations that include flow shear effects. The potential importance of this work was recognized by its having been selected for an invited oral talk at the most recent Sherwood Theory Conference. These new equations facilitate a self-consistent treatment {{of the effects of}} flow shear on neoclassical tearing modes, the study of which is just beginning. It is anticipated that the subcontract sublet to S. E. Kruger will allow him to continue this research work in close collaboration with C. C. Hegna and GA colleagues, and in particular to apply the resultant theory to DIII-D data on such effects. In addition, seed island formation induced by geometrically coupled perturbations was simulated using the neofar code, and the neoclassical tearing mode in DIII-D shot 86144. 02250 was simulated using the NIMROD code. Also, RF stabilization of tearing modes was modeled. Finally, a couple of summary-type talks were given in Japan on the status of neoclassical tearing mode studies. The model we have constructed in collaboration with DIII-D colleagues for the temporal development of <b>disruption</b> <b>precursors</b> in NSC L-mode DIII-D plasmas has been published as a General Atomics report and {{is in the process of}} being published in the Physics of Plasmas. This simple model is based on the temporal development of an ideal MHD instability as its beta is driven slowly through the instability threshold. Unfortunately, rather than being ''the'' mechanism for disruptions, it seems to be just one of many such mechanisms. In order to explore the topology of the magnetic flux surfaces just before the major disruption for our model, we have begun to use a signal analysis code developed previously to compare ECE signals with theoretical predictions for these <b>disruption</b> <b>precursors</b> [...] in particular their radial dependence, and the implications for the flux surface geometry and topology...|$|R
40|$|Studies of neoclassical tearing modes have {{remained}} the dominant {{area of research}} on this grant. Our major role in their development was recognized through an invited paper at the 1998 Pittsburgh DPP-APS meeting and through our inclusion as coauthors on some major TFTR and DIII-D papers. During this past year, prior work has been published on DIII-D experiment-motivated theories of stabilization of tearing modes via localized current-drive and heating and on effects of geometry on these modes (elongation and triangularity effects should be small in DIII-D), and on experimental studies of the imposed beta limits and direct, internal measurements of the critical classical tearing mode stability parameter (delta-prime). Also, linear and nonlinear theory and computation studies of classical tearing modes via the ''almost ideal MHD'' constraint {{has been the subject}} of a number of meeting presentations and has recently been published. Recent work has been concerned with developing a theoretical model for the magnitude of seed island perturbations due to, geometrically coupled magnetic perturbations (e. g., ELMS or sawtooth crashes) and simulations thereof, exploring the effects of external perturbations, development of a simulation model for flow shear effects, studies of the effect of the combination of flow shear and perpendicular viscosity in distorting the magnetic island structure and producing the phase shift in ECE signals across a magnetic island, simulations of feedback stabilization of tearing mode islands, and exploring what aspects of tearing modes need to be calculated for DIII-D. Our continuing role in transient transport and nonlocal electron heat transport was recognized by an invited paper at the June 1997 EPS Berchtesgaden meeting which was published this past year. In addition, further details of nonlocal electron heat transport, primarily on TFTR, have been the subject of meeting presentations and are being published. Since Dr. Kissick left this research group for UCLA in April 1998 and Prof. Callen is in the process of transferring leadership of the TTF Transient Transport Working Group to Prof. Gentle (U. Texas), it is anticipated that this grant research area will be substantially diminished in the future. Stimulated in large part by the excellent internal fluctuation diagnostics (primarily ECE and BES) for studying MHD modes in the interior of DIII-D, we have begun work in a new area: <b>disruption</b> <b>precursors</b> induced by MHD modes being driven slowly through their ideal stability boundaries. In particular, we have constructed a new model for the temporal development of such precursors and shown that it provides a very good fit to DIII-D data. Also, we are in the process of developing codes for comparing the spatial profile of the <b>disruption</b> <b>precursors</b> with those predicted from the GATO ideal MHD instability code...|$|R

The conceptual frameworks for this study were the resource dependence theory and the normal accident theory, which link supply chain disruptions with resource availability and the inability to eliminate disruptions. An exploratory case study involved exploring how supply chain managers of a warehouse distribution center in Jacksonville, Florida, successfully used strategies to mitigate the impact of a disruption after it occurred. Data came from responses to semistructured interview questions from these managers (n = 6) and archival documents related to policies, procedures, and business continuity planning of a warehouse distribution center in Jacksonville, Florida.

Biophysical modeling predicted the probability and rate of beta-sheet amyloid dimer formation to be higher and faster at the air-water interface (AWI) than in the bulk (by 14 and approximately 1500 times, respectively). Time-course staining experiments with a typical amyloid dye verified our predictions by demonstrating that without AWI, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) fibrilization was abolished or slowed, depending on the conditions. Our controls included undisturbed IAPP reactions, and we ascertained that the AWI removal process (technical or material) did not itself affect the reaction. Furthermore, we showed that the role of membranes in amyloidogenesis has been previously underestimated; in an in vivo-like situation (with no AWI), anionic liposomes (containing dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol) enhanced IAPP fibrilogenesis far more than described previously in conventional assay conditions (in the presence of an AWI).

40|$|Some low-n kink-ballooning modes not {{far from}} {{marginal}} stability are shown to exhibit a bifurcation between two very distinct nonlinear paths that depends sensitively on the background transport levels and linear perturbation amplitudes. The particular instability studied in this work is an n= 1 mode dominated by an m/n= 2 / 1 component. It is driven by a large pressure gradient in weak magnetic shear and can appear in various high-Î², hybrid/advanced scenarios. Here it is investigated in reversed shear equilibria where the region around the safety-factor minimum provides favorable conditions. For a certain range of parameters, a relatively benign path results in a saturated "long-lived mode" (LLM) that causes little confinement degradation. At the other extreme, the quadrupole geometry of the 2 / 1 perturbed pressure field evolves into a ballooning finger that subsequently transitions from exponential to explosive growth. The finger eventually leads to a fast <b>disruption</b> with <b>precursors</b> too short for any mitigation effort.

40|$|We {{report and}} discuss the results {{from a series of}} catastrophic {{disruption}} experiments involving 21 -cm spherical targets of alumina cement. These experiments were performed in the open air using a contact charge technique to simulate an impact at ~ 6 km/s, typical of collision velocities between asteroids in the main belt. The 1992 experiments reported here, the most recent in an extensive experimental program initiated by Giuseppe Martelli before his death in 1994, follow directly from those described in I. Giblin et al. (1994 a, Icarus 110, 203 - 224), with a number of improvements to our instrumentation and analysis. By using two high-speed cameras at a mutual angle of 60 deg we have made possible a three-dimensional analysis of fragment velocities alongside the standard size, shape, ejection angle and rotation rate measurements which can easily be made from appropriately oriented single film records. In this paper we report on the results of the 1992 experiments, together with various unpublished data from 1989. We make a comparison between these sets of data and between our data and those of other researchers in this field. Also, we compare our results to those of the most recent semi-empirical model (SEM) of P. Paolicchi et al. (1996, Icarus 121, 126 - 157) and to appropriate data concerning real asteroids, focusing on the dynamical families, which are believed to be remnants from the catastrophic <b>disruption</b> of <b>precursor</b> asteroids.

Fragment velocities are generally between 4 and 20 m/s with a few fast fragments observed up to 35 m/s. Only a weak correlation is found in either linear or angular velocity versus mass. We also test for the existence of a possible ``radiant point'' from which fragment velocities approximately originate and find that although it serves as a useful component in a model of the break-up, the location of such a point is not constant in our experiments...|$|R

To test whether specific cluster(s) of electronegative amino acids in pro-Crp 4 -(20 â 43) have specific positional effects that block bactericidal peptide activity and membrane disruption, acidic residues positioned at the distal (Asp 20, Asp 26, Glu 27, and Glu 28), mid (Glu 32 and Glu 33), and proximal (Glu 37, Glu 38, and Asp 39) clusters in pro-Crp 4 -(20 â 92) were mutagenized, and variants were assayed for differential effects of mutagenesis on bactericidal peptide activity.

40|$|The {{nuclear fusion}} arises as the unique clean energy source capable {{to meet the}} energy needs of the entire world in the future. On present days, several {{experimental}} fusion devices are operating to optimize the fusion process, confining the plasma by means of magnetic fields. The goal of plasma confined in a magnetic field {{can be achieved by}} linear cylindrical configurations or toroidal configurations, e. g., stellarator, reverse field pinch, or tokamak. Among the explored magnetic confinement techniques, the tokamak configuration is to date considered the most reliable. Unfortunately, the tokamak is vulnerable to instabilities that, in the most severe cases, can lead to lose the magnetic confinement; this phenomenon is called disruption. Disruptions are dangerous and irreversible events for the device during which the plasma energy is suddenly released on the first wall components and vacuum vessel causing runaway electrons, large mechanical forces and intense thermal loads, which may cause severe damage to the vessel wall and the plasma face components. Present devices are designed to resist the disruptive events; for this reason, today, the disruptions are generally tolerable. Furthermore, one of their aims is the investigation of disruptive boundaries in the operational space. However, on future devices, such as ITER, which must operate at high density and at high plasma current, {{only a limited number of}} disruptions will be tolerable. For these reasons, disruptions in tokamaks must be avoided, but, when a disruption is unavoidable, minimizing its severity is mandatory. Therefore, finding appropriate mitigating actions to reduce the damage of the reactor components is accepted as fundamental objective in the fusion community. The physical phenomena that lead plasma to disrupt are non-linear and very complex. The present understanding of disruption physics has not gone so far as to provide an analytical model describing the onset of these instabilities and the main effort has been devoted to develop data-based methods. In the present thesis the development of a reliable disruption prediction system has been investigated using several data-based approaches, starting from the strengths and the drawbacks of the methods proposed in the literature. In fact, literature reports numerous studies for disruption prediction using data-based models, such as neural networks. Even if the results are encouraging, they are not sufficient to explain the intrinsic structure of the data used to describe the complex behavior of the plasma. Recent studies demonstrated the urgency of developing sophisticated control schemes that allow exploring the operating limits of tokamak in order to increase the reactor performance. For this reason, one of the goal of the present thesis is to identify and to develop tools for visualization and analysis of multidimensional data from numerous plasma diagnostics available in the database of the machine. The identification of the boundaries of the disruption free plasma parameter space would lead to an increase in the knowledge of disruptions. A viable approach to understand disruptive events consists of identifying the intrinsic structure of the data used to describe the plasma operational space. Manifold learning algorithms attempt to identify these structures in order to find a low-dimensional representation of the data. Data for this thesis comes from ASDEX Upgrade (AUG). ASDEX Upgrade is a medium size tokamak experiment located at IPP Max-Planck-Institut fÃ¼r Plasmaphysik, Garching bei MÃ¼nchen (Germany). At present it is the largest tokamak in Germany. Among the available methods the attention has been mainly devoted to data clustering techniques. Data clustering consists on grouping a set of data in such a way that data in the same group (cluster) are more similar to each other than those in other groups. Due to the inherent predisposition for visualization, the most popular and widely used clustering technique, the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), has been firstly investigated. The SOM allows to extract information from the multidimensional operational space of AUG using 7 plasma parameters coming from successfully terminated (safe) and disruption terminated (disrupted) pulses. Data to train and test the SOM have been extracted from AUG experiments performed between July 2002 and November 2009. The SOM allowed to display the AUG operational space and to identify regions with high risk of disruption (disruptive regions) and those with low risk of disruption (safe regions). In addition to space visualization purposes, the SOM can be used also to monitor the time evolution of the discharges during an experiment. Thus, the SOM has been used as disruption predictor by introducing a suitable criterion, based on the trend of the trajectories on the map throughout the different regions. When a plasma configuration with a high risk of disruption is recognized, a disruption alarm is triggered allowing to perform disruption avoidance or mitigation actions. The data-based models, such as the SOM, are affected by the so-called "ageing effect". The ageing effect consists in the degradation of the predictor performance during the time. It is due to the fact that, during the operation of the predictor, new data may come from experiments different from those used for the training. In order to reduce such effect, a retraining of the predictor has been proposed. The retraining procedure consists of a new training procedure performed adding to the training set the new plasma configurations coming from more recent experimental campaigns. This aims to supply the novel information to the model to increase the prediction performances of the predictor. Another drawback of the SOM, common to all the proposed data-based models in literature, is the need of a dedicated set of experiments terminated with a disruption to implement the predictive model. Indeed, future fusion devices, like ITER, will tolerate only a limited number of disruptive events and hence the disruption database won't be available. In order to overcome this shortcoming, a disruption prediction system for AUG built using only input signals from safe pulses has been implemented. The predictor model is based on a Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) approach. FDI is an important and active research field which allows to monitor a system and to determine when a fault happens. The majority of model-based FDI procedures are based on a statistical analysis of residuals. Given an empirical model identified on a reference dataset, obtained under Normal Operating Conditions (NOC), the discrepancies between the new observations and those estimated by the NOCs (residuals) are calculated. The residuals are considered as a random process with known statistical properties. If a fault happens, a change of these properties is detected. In this thesis, the safe pulses are assumed as the normal operation conditions of the process and the disruptions are assumed as status of fault. Thus, only safe pulses are used to train the NOC model. In order to have a graphical representation of the trajectory of the pulses, only three plasma parameters have been used to build the NOC model. Monitoring the time evolution of the residuals by introducing an alarm criterion based on a suitable threshold on the residual values, the NOC model properly identifies an incoming disruption. Data for the training and the tests of the NOC model have been extracted from AUG experiments executed between July 2002 and November 2009. The assessment of a specific disruptive phase for each disruptive discharge represents a relevant issue in understanding the disruptive events. Up to now at AUG <b>disruption</b> <b>precursors</b> have been assumed appearing into a prefixed time window, the last 45 ms for all disrupted discharges. The choice of such a fixed temporal window could limit the prediction performance. In fact, it generates ambiguous information in cases of disruptions with disruptive phase different from 45 ms. In this thesis, the Mahalanobis distance is applied to define a specific disruptive phase for each disruption. In particular, a different length of the disruptive phase has been selected for each disrupted pulse in the training set by labeling each sample as safe or disruptive depending on its own Mahalanobis distance from the set of the safe discharges. Then, with this new training set, the operational space of AUG has been mapped using the Generative Topography Mapping (GTM). The GTM is inspired by the SOM algorithm, with the aim to overcome its limitations. The GTM has been investigated in order to identify regions with high risk of disruption and those with low risk of disruption. For comparison purposes a second SOM has been built. Hence, GTM and SOM have been tested as disruption predictors. Data for the training and the tests of the SOM and the GTM have been extracted from AUG experiments executed from May 2007 to November 2012. The last method studied and applied in this thesis has been the Logistic regression model (Logit). The logistic regression is a well-known statistic method to analyze problems with dichotomous dependent variables. In this study the Logit models the probability that a generic sample belongs to the non-disruptive or the disruptive phase. The time evolution of the Logit Model output (LMO) has been used as disruption proximity index by introducing a suitable threshold. Data for the training and the tests of the Logit models have been extracted from AUG experiments executed from May 2007 to November 2012. Disruptive samples have been selected through the Mahalanobis distance criterion. Finally, in order to interpret the behavior of data-based predictors, a manual classification of disruptions has been performed for experiments occurred from May 2007 to November 2012. The manual classification has been performed by means of a visual analysis of several plasma parameters for each disruption. Moreover, the specific chains of events have been detected and used to classify disruptions and when possible, the same classes introduced for JET are adopte...|$|R
