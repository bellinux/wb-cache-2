The duties of a Landvogt included collecting taxes, <b>implementing</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>measures,</b> judicial and police tasks {{and the power of}} military decree; they were also responsible for the upkeep of the castle. The Landvogt was elected from the ranks of the city council of Bern for four-year terms.

40|$|Summary. The {{present study}} {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} impact of laws and legislation on the safe construction of toys and their use by young children. The research hypothesis was that the European Union (EU) and its Member States, particularly Greece, <b>implement</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>measures</b> and penalties for the withdrawal of unsafe toys and inform consumers. Content analysis of European and Greek legislation, notifications and penalties imposed on offenders was used to test the hypothesis and the research objectives. The results showed an excessive number of violations of toy safety standards notified to Member States of the EU through the RAPEX system. Greece, despite delayed harmonisation with EU directives and poor information provided to consumers (parents, teachers, children's caregivers, toy librarians), has taken measures to restrict or prevent the distribution of faulty products...|$|R

40|$|Economic and {{financial}} developments on the Mainland {{have important implications}} for Hong Kong. This paper presents an empirical framework for assessing monetary {{and financial}} conditions on the Mainland by estimating a monetary conditions index (MCI). An MCI is usually defined as a weighted sum of some measures of real interest rate and the real effective exchange rate (REER). Because bank credit is an important channel of monetary policy transmission mechanism in Mainland China, this study extends the conventional MCI by including a quantity variable to capture the credit availability effect. Estimates suggest that, in terms of the effect on real GDP growth, a rise in real interest rates by 1 percentage point is equivalent to an increase in REER appreciation by about 4 percentage points or a fall in real credit growth by 2. 5 percentage points. The estimated MCI suggests a sharp easing in monetary conditions in 2002 - 2003, reflecting a weaker US dollar, relaxed credit stance of banks, and easing of deflation which reduced real interest rates. The fall in the MCI is equivalent to a decline of about 10 percentage points in real interest rates during the period. Easy monetary conditions have contributed to an acceleration in economic growth since 2002. Fears of overheating pressures prompted the authorities to <b>implement</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>measures</b> in early 2004 to curb credit supply to selected sectors and raise interest rates in late October 2004. The estimated MCI suggests that the tightening of monetary conditions is equivalent to a rise in real interest rates by about 4. 6 percentage points. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the problem of patent ambush in standard setting, where patent owners are sometimes able to capture industry standards {{in order to secure}} monopoly power and windfall profits. Because standardisation generally introduces high switching costs, patent ambush can impose significant costs on downstream manufacturers and consumers and drastically reduce the efficiency gains of standardisation. This article considers how Australian competition law is likely to apply to patent ambush both {{in the development of a}} standard (through misrepresenting the existence of an essential patent) and after a standard is implemented (through refusing to license an essential patented technology either at all or on reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND) terms). This article suggests that non-disclosure of patent interests is unlikely to restrained by Part IV of the Trade Practices Act (TPA), and refusals to license are only likely to be restrained if the refusal involves leveraging or exclusive dealing. By contrast, Standard Setting Organisations (SSOs) which seek to limit this behaviour through private ordering may face considerable scrutiny under the new cartel provisions of the TPA. This article concludes that SSOs may be best advised to <b>implement</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>measures</b> to prevent patent hold-up, such as reviewing which patents are essential for the implementation of a standard, asking patent holders to make their licence conditions public to promote transparency, and establishing forums where patent licensees can complain about licence terms that they consider to be unreasonable or discriminatory. Additionally, the ACCC may play a role in authorising SSO policies that could otherwise breach the new cartel provisions, but which have the practical effect of promoting competition in the standards setting environment. ...|$|R

Citizens are demanding more value for their money, better and fast service. A service delivery system that emphasizes on efficiency and quality {{is one of the most}} important determinants contributing to satisfaction with the services provided by the public sector in Malaysia. This study examined the relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction in the public sector in Malaysia. The study was conducted in a government department in the northern state of Malaysia. Questionnaire was administered to 40 respondents who are registered as external customers of the department. The Pearson correlation was used to measure the significance of the relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction. The findings show that responsiveness was rated as the most dominant dimension of service quality followed by courtesy, reliability, access, tangibles, and security. The dimension of credibility, communication, understanding knowing the customer, and competence has non-significant relationship with customer satisfaction. This study concludes that these service quality dimensions should never be taken for granted in an effort to ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by the public sector in Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|Background: In China, {{there is}} a very long history of burn wound treatment, but the {{specialised}} burn care units were set up only from 1958. With more than 50 years of practice, great achievements have been made in burn wound care and operations in the country. However, in terms of burn rehabilitation, the development appears to be slow. In order to determine the current status of burn rehabilitation services in China, a survey was conducted to various burn centres in China. Methods: A comprehensive survey was conducted as well as to collect data related to (1) the admissions and staffing of the burn centres; (2) availability of rehabilitation services, number and educational background of specialised personnel dedicated in burn rehabilitation therapy; and (3) the difficulties leading to the lag of the burn rehabilitation services. The survey was sent to the chiefs of 87 burn centres via e-mail and they were requested to fill out the survey questionnaire and to send it back. For those who did not respond within 1 month, a reminder was sent. Results: There are totally 39 (44. 8 %) burn centres responding to our survey. These centres were geographically distributed in nearly 70 % of the administrative provinces in China; hence, the results could well represent the current burn care system. Most centres have recognised the importance of rehabilitation therapy and remarkable improvements of outcome in burn patients have been achieved. There are a very huge number of burn patients that need rehabilitation therapy, but most centres face the problems of shortage of rehabilitation therapists, which apparently could lead to the difficulties in delivering a quality rehabilitation programme for patients. Although the time of rehabilitation therapy is instituted far earlier than before, it is still not widely accepted in the acute burn care stage. There are more specialists joining the burn centre and becoming members of the professional burn team. However, professional education and training in the burn specialty appear to be sparse. There is room for improvement. Problems that impede the progress of rehabilitation therapy are: lack of rehabilitation knowledge in medical staff as well as the public, the shortage of specialised personnel and relatively low educational background of this team, lack of standard guidelines for rehabilitation treatment instructions and lack of funding from the government. Conclusion: After 20 years of clinical practice, rehabilitation concepts are well accepted and many forms of rehabilitation techniques are carried out in most burn centres that responded to the survey. Yet, the results also indicate that {{there is a}} short history of rehabilitation practice among the burn centres. There is a burning need to enhance the development of rehabilitation services so as {{to meet the demands of}} management of severely burned patients in China. Some suggestions are made to improve the current burn rehabilitation services which would include: (1) provide rehabilitation education programmes for burn surgeons, therapists, nurses, as well as patients, families and the public; (2) set up standard guidelines for clinical instruction of rehabilitation therapy; (3) build an interdisciplinary burn team; (4) more investigation and research on the physical and psychological outcomes of burn patients; and (5) <b>implement</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>measures</b> in terms of staffing, funding and offering insurance to burn survivors.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to interpret the}} range of“legal interests”stipulated in article 36 of Japan's Administrative Case Litigation Act (hereafter“ act”) ．It appears that {{there has not been}} much debate on the substance of legal interests under article 36 of the act partly because this article, associated with nullity declaration suit, is said {{to be one of the}} most difficult provisions for legal interpretation. While it has generally been accepted that the legal interests are the same as those stipulated article 9 (paragraph 1) in relation to revocation suit, this idea does not reflect the overall provisions of the act. On the basis of rigid interpretation of the act, it would be fair to note that the person who has legal interests under article 36 includes those who have got damage to their constitutional fundamental rights by <b>administrative</b> <b>measures</b> having substantial defect and those who have got serious damage to their “consequential”legal interests (normally a direct addressee of an <b>administrative</b> <b>measure)</b> ．This interpretation stands out from the comparison with the coverage of the person having legal interests under article 9 of the act, which has broader possibility to include those who have legal rights or benefits to be damaged by <b>administrative</b> <b>measures</b> without a“substantial”defect and those who have got“indifferent” damage to their legal interests. Therefore, it is not appropriate to simply assume the coverage of legal interests under article 36 to be the same as that stipulated in article 9 of the act. The substantive difference between revocable <b>administrative</b> <b>measures</b> and null <b>administrative</b> <b>measures</b> lies behind this interpretation. 田口信夫、高倉泰夫、森永春乃先生 定年退職記念...|$|R
