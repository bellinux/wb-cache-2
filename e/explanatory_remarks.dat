I found him sitting on a very low chair next to a small, hot stove in a yellow-painted, sloping-roofed attic. Only {{with the help of}} a stick was he able to walk, {{staggering}} around the room. ... A colourfully painted curtain concealed a large collection of paintings. When we began to look at them, he came alive. Together with me, he saw all his experiences drift by on canvas, the small, timid-looking woman set aside what we had seen and brought a bottle of wine. He made short <b>explanatory</b> <b>remarks</b> in a weary voice. Each picture had its own particular colourful character, a great sadness was present in all of them; what I had previously found to be incomprehensible and unfinished now created the same delicate and sensitive impression as his personality. Everywhere a search for style, for psychological understanding of his figures. The most moving was a self- portrait in uniform with his right hand cut off. Then he showed me his travel permit for Switzerland. He wanted to go back to Davos... and implored me to ask father for a medical certificate. ... As the woman with him rightly said, though many people want to help him, nobody is able to do so any longer. ... When I was leaving, I thought of Van Gogh’s fate and thought that it would be his as well, sooner or later. Only later will people understand and see how much he has contributed to painting".|$|E

60|$|I {{could not}} {{doubt that this}} was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had been told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and I remembered that I had heard someone {{describe}} her as being a beauty. The woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a most uncommon type. There could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted, with light hair and gray eyes, while she was darker than any brunette whom I have seen in England--slim, elegant, and tall. She had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it might have seemed impassive {{were it not for the}} sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure and elegant dress she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path. Her eyes were on her brother as I turned, and then she quickened her pace towards me. I had raised my hat and was about to make some <b>explanatory</b> <b>remark,</b> when her own words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the possibility of an}} enlarged QCD color group, SU(3 +N^') spontaneously broken to SU(3) _c×SU(N^') with extra vector-like quarks transforming in the fundamental representation. When the heavy quarks are integrated out below the PQ-breaking scale, they generate an axion coupling which simultaneously solves the strong CP problem for both gauge groups. However, the axion mass now receives a new nonperturbative contribution from the SU(N^') confinement scale, which can be substantially larger than the QCD scale. This can increase the axion mass to be at or above the electroweak scale. This visible axion can then decay into gluons and photons giving rise to observable signals at Run-II of the LHC. In particular, if the mass is identified with the 750 GeV diphoton resonance then the new confinement scale is ∼ TeV and the PQ-breaking scale is ∼ 10 TeV. This predicts vector-like quarks and a PQ scalar resonance in the multi-TeV range, with the possibility that dark matter is an SU(N^') baryon.

At the time, it is clear that she considered me a dilatory intermediary. I had not realized how extreme was her need. But she came at last to take a far too generous view of these trifling little services--services as generously rewarded, since they afforded me the opportunity of frequently seeing her, and so of becoming, as I hope, one of her most devoted friends.|$|E
60|$|There {{were present}} in the room, besides those already mentioned, a Turkish colonel of cavalry and a German doctor who spoke Turkish fluently.

The Pasha always gave the signal to begin to each dish, and between courses the dervish told stories from the Arabian Nights' Entertainments, or uttered witticisms which kept the Nubian Pasha in roars of laughter. They were all very merry, for the host was fond of boisterous fun and practical jokes, while his guests were sympathetic. Lancey laughed as much as any of them, for although he could not, despite his previous studies, follow the conversation, he could understand the pantomime, and appreciated the viands highly.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{application}} of European Community (EC) 1 Competition Law by the competent Communitarian institutions, namely the Commission, the Court of First Instance and the European Court of Justice. Because the discussion will concern its application to non-European legal entities, one <b>explanatory</b> <b>remark</b> is necessary. Dealing with the application of Competition Law with regard to non-European corporations {{is not meant to}} suggest that any form of discrimination based on nationality exists. As former Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan commented with regard to one of the early cases involving non-EC companies, “the location of a party’s incorporation or headquarters is immaterial for Competition Law”, 2 which must focus on impact on markets. One necessary goal of this thesis then will be the assessment of the EC’s treatment of these cases. A legal entity’s non-European nationality must not be confused with the lack of links to the EC, as the presence of an established (not necessarily incorporated) branch or subsidiary within the EC will suffice to determine the ordinary - that is territorial - application of EC law. Instead, the focus will be on cases that would require extraterritorial application of the law: As it will be discussed, the Court of Justice has never formally endorsed the principle of extraterritorial jurisdiction, 3 so that {{it will be necessary to}} discover how the EC deals with cases that have no links that could trigger the territoriality principle. Another purpose of this thesis will be to search into the ramifications of the transnational structure of certain corporations. In fact, while these may be affected by the peculiarities of EC Competition Law, they may be able to affect a market in Europe through their dominance of another market elsewhere. Based on the assumption that the legal standards cannot and will not vary simply depending on the nationality of the entities that are subject to the EC’s sovereignty, a case-oriented analysis will be made to uncover the general orientations, if any, followed by the Communitarian institutions in the application of Competition Law to non-EC firms. However, while Mr. Brittan’s argument can be said to hold true, it must also be noted that EC law is no exception to one basic principle, that is the territorial nature of the law. The law is the expression of one sovereign power which has territorially limited extension and its application to entities or situations that have no territorial links to its territory deserves special treatment...|$|R
40|$|Mark Blaug has {{recently}} presented {{a very negative}} appraisal of the empirical validity of Marx’s economic theory: Blaug concludes that Marx’s theory has been glaringly refuted by the empirical evidence of the last century. This paper presents a Marxian response to Blaug’s negative appraisal of Marx’s theory. The paper reexamines in detail Blaug’s empirical evidence and other related evidence {{with respect to the}} following conclusions: the falling rate of profit, the impoverishment of workers, conflict over the length of the working day, conflict over the intensity of labor, recurring depressions, increasing concentration of capital, proletarianization of the labor force, and the necessity of money.

5000|$|Richardson {{was even}} more {{influential}} as a writer than as a painter according to Samuel Johnson. He is credited with inspiring Joshua Reynolds to paint and theorise with his 1715 book An Essay on the Theory of Painting. In 1722, Richardson published with his son, also Jonathan (1694-1771), An Account of Some of the Statues, Bas-Reliefs, Drawings, and Pictures in Italy (1722). The book was compiled by Richardson the elder using material gathered by his son whilst touring Italy in 1721. This was a very popular book and was used by young men {{as a basis for}} their Grand Tour. It was said that the book became the basis for future purchases of art by wealthy collectors and therefore shaped English interest in foreign old masters. It also provided an important model for Johann Joachim Winckelmann's History of Art (1764). [...] Richardson and his son also co-authored their <b>Explanatory</b> Notes and <b>Remarks</b> on Milton's Paradise Lost (1734). These notes are, in part, a response to Richard Bentley's 1732 edition of Paradise Lost, in which he frequently faults Milton's style or places exceptionable passages in square brackets, claiming they are the work of another hand. The Richardsons' responses to Bentley helped to lay the foundation for subsequent interpretation of the poem.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of {{preliminary}} remarks prior to open question upon the contents of speaker's responses. It was hypothesized that there should be variances in the contents of responses to open questions which have different preliminary remarks prior to them. The remarks which stress explanation lead to explanatory responses to the open question, whereas the remarks which stress evaluation lead to evaluative responses to the same open question, as compared with the responses to the same open question which has no preliminary remarks. Sixty one undergraduates served as the participants were assigned to one of the three groups: the <b>explanatory</b> preliminary <b>remarks</b> group (EXP gr.), the evaluative preliminary remarks group (EVA gr.), and the no preliminary remarks group (NO gr.). The participant assigned to the EXP group was asked as follows: "Please remember someone who is particularly intimate with vou. I would like to ask you how you explain your friendship if you do so. Could you tell me about your friendship as you like?" The participant assigned to the EVA group was asked as follows: "Please remember someone who is particularly intimate with you. I would like to ask you how you evaluate your friendship if you do so. Could you tell me about your friendship as you like?" The participant assigned to the NO group was asked only as follows: "Could you tell me about your friendship as you like?" About half of the participants were asked about their friendship, whereas the other half were asked about their career. Every verbal response was audiotaped and was transcribed in wordprocessor. The results were analyzed qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The results showed that in the quantitative measures there were no statistical differences among the groups, whereas in the quantitative measure there were statistically significant differences in line with our predictions. It was stressed that the clarity of intention of the listener when the listener asks an open question is important because the suitability of speaker's answer seems vary depending on the clarity of intention of the open question...|$|R
40|$|We present {{matching}} {{conditions for}} distributional sources of arbitrary codimension {{in the context}} of Lovelock gravity. Then we give examples, treating maximally symmetric distributional p-branes, embedded in flat, de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spacetime. Unlike Einstein theory, distributional defects of locally smooth geometry and codimension greater than 2 are demonstrated to exist in Lovelock theories. The form of the matching conditions depends on the parity of the brane codimension. For odd codimension, the matching conditions involve discontinuities of Chern-Simons forms and are thus similar to junction conditions for hypersurfaces. For even codimension, the bulk Lovelock densities induce intrinsic Lovelock densities on the brane. In particular, this results in the appearance of the induced Einstein tensor for p> 2. For the matching conditions we present, the effect of the bulk is reduced to an overall topological solid angle defect which sets the Planck scale on the brane and to extrinsic curvature terms. Moreover, for topological matching conditions and constant solid angle deficit, we find that the equations of motion are obtained from an exact p+ 1 dimensional action, which reduces to an induced Lovelock theory for large codimension. In essence, this signifies that the distributional part of the Lovelock bulk equations can naturally give rise to induced gravity terms on a brane of even co-dimension. We relate our findings to recent results on codimension 2 branes.

Soon after, Kirchner's close friend and mentor, Botho Graef died and Kirchner decided to return to Davos for treatment. There he was under the care of Dr. Lucius Spengler who forced Kirchner to adhere to strict rules and routine. Kirchner deeply resented this and did everything in his power to deceive the doctor: [...] "Spengler didn’t know what to do with me, for my deception was totally alien to this excellent man’s way of thinking". To avoid being under constant watch, Kirchner moved to the Reusch Hut on the Stafelalp in the summer of 1917. Kirchner continued to experience depression, occasional pain and paralysis of his limbs but wrote in a more cheerful tone to Dr. Hagemann at the end of July: [...] "I wish to remain in the world and for the world. The high mountains here will help me". The summer was very productive despite Kirchner's illness. He finished some important pieces during the two month, such as [...] "View of the Church in Monstein" [...] and [...] "Rising Moon in the Stafelalp".
