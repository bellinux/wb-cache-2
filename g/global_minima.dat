Relaxation to the <b>global</b> <b>minimum</b> is easiest for PES's consisting of a single funnel (a set of convergent pathways which lead to the <b>global</b> <b>minimum)</b> with low barriers and a significant potential energy gradient towards the <b>global</b> <b>minimum.</b> The presence of additional funnels on the surface can severely reduce the rate of relaxation to the <b>global</b> <b>minimum.</b> Such secondary funnels act most efficiently as kinetic traps when they terminate at a low energy minimum, have a steep potential energy gradient and are wide (i. e., have a large configurational entropy) compared to the primary funnel. Indeed, it is even possible to construct PES's for which the system relaxes to the minimum {{at the bottom of}} a secondary funnel rather than the <b>global</b> <b>minimum</b> and then remains in this metastable state over a long time scale. Our results for these model PES's are discussed in the context of theoretical and experimental knowledge of the dynamics of proteins, clusters, and glasses. © 1996 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

40|$|Background: Proteins seem to {{have their}} native {{structure}} in a <b>global</b> <b>minimum</b> of free energy. No mechanism is known, however, for ensuring this property. Furthermore, computational complexity studies suggest that such a mechanism is not feasible. These seemingly contradictory observations can be reconciled by the suggestion that evolutionary selection can yield proteins whose native conformation is in the <b>global</b> <b>minimum</b> of free energy. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate such evolutionary processes in a simple model of protein folding. Results: Three possible evolutionary processes are explored. First, if the free energy of the chain is kept below a fixed threshold there is no improvement towards the <b>global</b> <b>minimum.</b> Second, if free energy is minimized directly, sequences emerge whose native conformation is in the <b>global</b> <b>minimum</b> of free energy. Third, when evolutionary pressure is applied within a small set of close homologs, sequences emerge whose functional conformation is in the <b>global</b> <b>minimum</b> of free energy. Conclusions:Although minimizing free energy does select for sequences whose functional conformation is in the <b>global</b> free energy <b>minimum,</b> we argue that for most proteins, which typically have free energy values of only 5 – 15 kcal/mol, such evolutionary pressure cannot be considered biologically plausible. In contrast, by repeatedly forcing sequences to avoid drifting towards competing “non-native” conformations, sequences emerge whose native conformation becomes very close to the <b>global</b> <b>minimum</b> of free energy. We argue that such a mechanism is both efficient and biologically plausible...|$|R
