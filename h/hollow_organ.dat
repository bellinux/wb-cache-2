5|$|Great feats {{were made}} during the third century in both the {{digestive}} and reproductive systems. Herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands, but the small intestine and liver. He showed that the uterus is a <b>hollow</b> <b>organ</b> and described the ovaries and uterine tubes. He recognized that spermatozoa were produced by the testes {{and was the first}} to identify the prostate gland.|$|E
25|$|In vertebrates, the {{gallbladder}} {{is a small}} <b>hollow</b> <b>organ</b> where bile {{is stored}} and concentrated before it is released into the small intestine. In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver, although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives and stores bile, produced by the liver, via the common hepatic duct, and releases it via the common bile duct into the duodenum, where the bile helps in the digestion of fats.|$|E
25|$|Neurogenic shock {{is caused}} by the loss of {{vascular}} tone normally supported by the sympathetic nervous system due to injury to the central nervous system especially spinal cord injury. Rupture of a <b>hollow</b> <b>organ,</b> with subsequent evacuation of contents in the peritoneal cavity could also determine neurogenic shock, a subtype of distributive shock. This happens due to the widespread peritoneal irritation by the ruptured viscus contents, as in peptic ulcer perforation, with consequent strong vagal activation, and generalized, extensive peripheral vasodilation and bradycardia.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, the {{regeneration}} of <b>hollow</b> <b>organs</b> and tissues {{with a long}} diffusion distance, was {{a little}} more challenging. Therefore, to regenerate <b>hollow</b> <b>organs</b> and tissues with a long diffusion distance, the tissue had to be regenerated inside the lab, via the use of a 3D printer.|$|R

2500|$|The stomach (from ancient Greek στόμαχος, stomachos, stoma means mouth) is a muscular, <b>hollow</b> <b>organ</b> in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{of humans and}} many other animals, including several invertebrates. The stomach has a dilated structure and functions as a vital digestive organ. [...] In the digestive system the stomach {{is involved in the}} second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing).|$|E
2500|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} are {{not seen in}} early days and after some days initial pain is seen. People injured in motor vehicle collisions may present with a [...] "seat belt sign," [...] bruising on the abdomen along {{the site of the}} lap portion of the safety belt; this sign is associated with a high rate of injury to the abdominal organs. Seatbelts may also cause abrasions and hematomas; up to 30 percent of people with such signs have associated internal injuries. Early indications of abdominal trauma include nausea, vomiting, blood in the urine, and fever. [...] The injury may present with abdominal pain, tenderness, distension, or rigidity to the touch, and bowel sounds may be diminished or absent. Abdominal guarding is a tensing of the abdominal wall muscles to guard inflamed organs within the abdomen. Pneumoperitoneum, air or gas in the abdominal cavity, may be an indication of rupture of a <b>hollow</b> <b>organ.</b> In penetrating injuries, an evisceration (protrusion of internal organs out of a wound) may be present.|$|E

5000|$|Compliance is {{the ability}} of a <b>hollow</b> <b>organ</b> (vessel) to distend and {{increase}} volume with increasing transmural pressure or the tendency of a <b>hollow</b> <b>organ</b> to resist recoil toward its original dimensions on application of a distending or compressing force. It is the reciprocal of [...] "elastance", hence elastance {{is a measure of the}} tendency of a <b>hollow</b> <b>organ</b> to recoil toward its original dimensions upon removal of a distending or compressing force.|$|E
50|$|Fecaluria is {{the mixture}} of feces and urine that is passed from the urethra due to a fistula between the {{intestinal}} tract and bladder. A fistula is an abnormal passage that leads from an abscess or <b>hollow</b> <b>organ</b> to the body surface or from one <b>hollow</b> <b>organ</b> to another. It may be surgically created to permit the passage of fluids or secretions.|$|E

40|$|Many medical {{conditions}} require surgical reconstruction of <b>hollow</b> <b>organs.</b> Tissue engineering of organs and tissues is a promising new technique without harvest site morbidity. An ideal biomaterial should be biocompatible, support tissue formation and provide adequate structural support. It should degrade gradually {{and provide an}} environment allowing for cell-cell interaction, adhesion, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Although tissue formation is feasible, functionality has never been demonstrated. Mainly the lack of proper innervation and vascularisation are hindering contractility and normal function. In this chapter we critically review {{the current state of}} engineering <b>hollow</b> <b>organs</b> with a special focus on innervation and vascularisation...|$|R

50|$|A fistula is an {{abnormal}} connection between two hollow spaces (technically, two epithelialized surfaces), such as blood vessels, intestines, or other <b>hollow</b> <b>organs.</b> Fistulas are usually caused by injury or surgery, {{but they can}} also result from an infection or inflammation. Fistulas are generally a disease condition, but they may be surgically created for therapeutic reasons.|$|R

However, visualization of the pancreas often requires that pressure be applied with the probe on the upper abdomen to displace the overlying <b>hollow</b> <b>organs.</b> This can change the relationships between abdominal structures, which can affect the matching between the US and CT/MR images.|$|R
