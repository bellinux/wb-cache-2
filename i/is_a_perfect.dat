5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E
5|$|Black Swan is a 2010 American {{psychological}} horror film {{directed by}} Darren Aronofsky. The screenplay by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin {{is from a}} story by Heinz. It stars Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder. The plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake ballet by a prestigious New York City ballet company. The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile White Swan, for which the committed dancer Nina (Portman) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> fit, {{as well as the}} dark and sensual Black Swan, which are qualities better embodied by the new arrival Lily (Kunis). Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part, causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into a living nightmare.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> {{opportunity}} for his business rival, Plankton {{to steal the}} Krabby Patty formula. Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick {{as a security guard}} so he does not have to pay for a real one, and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture that he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that {{there is a way to}} escape without using the door, which is through the ventilation system. While finding their way through the maze of air vents, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives.|$|E

5|$|The {{claim that}} all humans are due {{dignity and respect}} as {{autonomous}} agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed on anyone and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society. Kant's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely {{as a means to}} an end, leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific sexual practices - for example, extramarital sex. Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because they treat women as ends. Kant also believed that, because animals do not possess rationality, we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them. Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics: because there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> duty to tell the truth, we must never lie, even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth.|$|E

25|$|The naive {{approach}} to finding a congruence of squares is {{to pick a}} random number, square it, and hope the least non-negative remainder modulo n <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> square (in the integers).

This approach finds a congruence of squares only rarely for large n, but when it does find one, more often than not, the congruence is nontrivial and the factorization is complete. This is roughly the basis of Fermat's factorization method.|$|E
