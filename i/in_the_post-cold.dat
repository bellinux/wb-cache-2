In January 1990, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan publicly voiced his support for Vietnam, {{and the rest of}} Indochina, to gain admission into ASEAN. In the period between late 1991 and early 1992, Vietnam restored relations with several member nations of ASEAN. As a result, between 1991 and 1994, investments from ASEAN countries made up 15 percent of direct foreign investment in Vietnam. Aside from the obvious economic benefits, ASEAN also provided a peaceful environment that guaranteed Vietnam's national security against foreign threats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>post-Cold</b> War era, when Soviet aid was no longer available. Thus, on 28 July 1995, Vietnam officially became the seventh member of ASEAN, after leading ASEAN officials invited Vietnam to join at the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Bangkok in 1994. Then, in August 1995, the U.S. Liaison Office in Hanoi was upgraded to Embassy status, after U.S. President Bill Clinton announced a formal normalisation of diplomatic relations with Vietnam on 11 July 1995, thereby ending Vietnam’s isolation from the United States.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{boundary}} solutions to gas supply coordination between gas-exporting countries from a Russian perspective <b>in</b> light of <b>the</b> <b>post-Cold</b> War geopolitical context. Russia is seeking to redefine its place in an ever-changing international political system. Its vast gas resources, and their profitable development, could serve to strengthen Russia’s position in that system while income from gas export earnings could enhance Russia’s economic security. For both Russia and its state-controlled Gazprom the stream and possible expansion of income from gas exports are economically vital. Together with Gazprom, Russia {{must take into account}} demand uncertainty and competition from other gas-exporting countries in an increasingly interregional and dynamic gas market. As the industry matures, gas-exporting countries could avoid price competition through (informal) coordination as far as capacity expansions are concerned, for example. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) offers Russia a possible platform for such coordination. However, Russia also desires to preserve an independent course for its gas exports strategy. Investments in gas infrastructures potentially act as important instruments for securing and expanding Gazprom’s market share in growing markets. In light of demand uncertainties and potential competition, a ‘real-option game’ model is applied to explain why Gazprom continuously tries {{to strike a balance between}} cooperation and competition with other gas-exporters. Whether–and in what form–gas supply coordination may arise depends on Russia’s geopolitical perception of a dominant position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> European gas market, which hinges <b>in</b> part on <b>the</b> <b>post-Cold</b> War geopolitical context <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> great powers vie for a position on the Eurasian continent. The boundary solutions to cooperation between Russia and other gas-exporting countries are therefore also subject to geopolitical forces. ...|$|R

25|$|Western Europe {{launched}} {{a process of}} political and economic integration, with the aim to unite the region and defend it. This process included organisations such as the European Coal and Steel Community, which grew and evolved into the European Union, and the Council of Europe. The Solidarność movement in the 1980s weakened the Communist government in Poland. At the time the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev initiated perestroika and glasnost, which weakened Soviet influence in Europe, particularly in the USSR. In 1989 the Berlin Wall came down and Communist governments outside the Soviet Union were deposed. In 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany absorbed East Germany, after making large cash payments to the USSR. In 1991 the Communist Party in Moscow collapsed, ending the USSR, which split into fifteen independent states. The largest, Russia, took the Soviet Union's seat on the United Nations Security Council. The most violent dissolution happened in Yugoslavia, in the Balkans. Four (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia) out of six Yugoslav republics declared independence and for most of them a violent war ensued, in some parts lasting until 1995.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the practice of}} UN peacekeeping operations during {{the first decade of}} <b>the</b> <b>post-Cold</b> War era, focusing on three cases: Somalia, Bosnia- Herzegovina, and Kosovo. During the early 1990 s, the international community escalated its expectations of and demands upon the UN and its peacekeepers for massive and expanded interventions to deal with increased intra-state conflicts. <b>In</b> this sense, <b>the</b> interventions <b>in</b> Somalia and Bosnia-Herzegovina were the test cases of the UN's capabilities and the political willingness of the international community. Many believe that <b>the</b> peacekeeping experiences <b>in</b> both regions were {{one of the most important}} developments for the evolution of UN peacekeeping operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990 s. This thesis argues that <b>the</b> operations <b>in</b> Somalia and Bosnia were not evidence of the evolution of peacekeeping, but were cases of the misuse of peacekeeping techniques, and furthermore that this misuse was the key reason for the failures of <b>the</b> operations. <b>In</b> other words, <b>the</b> deployment of UN peacekeepers to places where there was no peace to keep deeply affected the outbreak of the Black Hawk Down incident <b>in</b> Somalia and <b>the</b> Srebrenica massacre <b>in</b> Bosnia. <b>The</b> decision-makers of the UN and member states of the Security Council employed an inappropriate measure to tackle the crises that required well-prepared military enforcement actions in terms of planning and capabilities including structured command and control systems. As an agential factor of <b>the</b> failures <b>in</b> Somalia and Bosnia, the misuse of peacekeeping techniques was deeply affected by the structural features of <b>the</b> <b>post-Cold</b> War order: <b>the</b> increase of intra-state or regional armed conflicts with intense hostility on an unprecedented scale and the construction of an identity by Western governments to tackle conflicts stemming from the widespread belief of <b>the</b> `liberal triumph' <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>post-Cold</b> War era.

A Trilateral Commission report notes that the shift from a world led by the two rival Soviet- and U.S.-led blocs meant a general diffusion of power. Growth of economic interdependence, proliferation of transnational actors, nationalism in weak states, spread of technology, and increasing numbers of issues (such as global environmental problems and {{weapons of mass destruction}} containment) that are both domestic and international generated stronger incentive to develop international cooperation than ever before. Democracy in general had spread; in 2003, Freedom House counted 121 electoral democracies, compared to 66 in 1987 and 30 in 1975 (although by the mid-2000s, the trend appeared to have stagnated). The rapidly integrating European Union, a unique supranational body whose European Parliament was gradually growing in power, provided an example to the world of how a multi-nation parliament can evolve and function. The World Trade Organization and similar organizations generated great concern as they seemed to be gaining more influence and control over trade disputes, yet were not accountable to the people; U.S. President Bill Clinton argued, [...] "We must insist that international trade organizations be open to public scrutiny instead of mysterious, secret things subject to wild criticism."

At times the history lecture becomes a forced march over very familiar terrain, but patient readers will discover that there is indeed a final destination". In a second review for the New York Times in 2007, Niall Ferguson, a history professor at Harvard University, described The Utility of Force as an update of Clausewitz's On War [...] "for our times". Ferguson went on to criticise Smith for drawing too clear a distinction between [...] "war amongst the people" [...] and [...] "war between peoples", pointing out that in several conflicts there was no single, homogeneous [...] "people" [...] and that wars amongst the people can easily transform into wars between people, citing Bosnia as an example. Ferguson was underwhelmed by Smith's recommendations for the future—Smith believes that new equipment and strategies are required in order for armies to be effective in the new paradigm, but does not offer any suggestions. Ferguson's final criticism was what he described as the book's [...] "limited historical perspective"; Smith argues that [...] "war amongst the people" [...] emerged {{in the second half of}} the 20th century during the proxy wars and de-colonisation campaigns of the Cold War era, but Ferguson gave examples of similar campaigns which pre-dated the Cold War, including the First Boer War (1880–81) and campaigns fought in Eastern Europe during the Second World War. Nonetheless, Ferguson concludes that The Utility of Force is [...] "an impressive and absorbing work", and described Smith as [...] "the Clausewitz of low-intensity conflict and peacekeeping operations".|$|E
