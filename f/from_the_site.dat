40|$|Activity of {{xanthine}} oxidase, {{levels of}} lipid peroxidation and ascorbic acid were studied in African land snail (Achatina marginatus) from two sites with different pollution potentials.

40|$|We have visualized the intranuclear {{topography}} of adenovirus replication and transcription in infected HeLa cells. The {{results show that}} viral DNA replication occurs in multiple foci that are highly organized in the nucleoplasm. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that newly synthesized viral double-stranded DNA molecules are displaced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> replication foci and spread throughout the nucleoplasm, while the single-stranded DNA replication intermediates accumulate in adjacent sites. Double-labelling experiments and confocal microscopy show that replication occurs in foci localized at the periphery of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> where single-stranded DNA accumulates. The simultaneous visualization of viral replication and transcription reveals that <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of transcription are predominantly separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of replication. Transcription is detected adjacent to the replication foci and extends around <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of single-stranded DNA accumulation. These data indicate that newly synthesized double-stranded DNA molecules are displaced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> replication foci and spread in the surrounding nucleoplasm, where they are used as templates for transcription. Splicing snRNPs are shown to co-localize with <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of transcription and to be excluded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of replication. This provides evidence that splicing of viral RNAs occurs co-transcriptionally and that <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of viral DNA replication are spatially distinct <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of RNA transcription and processing...|$|R
