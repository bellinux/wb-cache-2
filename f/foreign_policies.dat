5|$|Historian Wilson D. Miscamble {{argues that}} Kennan played a {{critical}} role in developing the <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> of the Truman administration. He also states that Kennan did not believe in either global or strongpoint containment; he simply wanted to restore the balance of power between the United States and the Soviets. Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global containment.|$|E
5|$|After {{the three-year}} {{transition}} period ended with Nasser's official assumption of power, his domestic and independent <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> increasingly {{collided with the}} regional interests of the UK and France. The latter condemned his strong support for Algerian independence, and the UK's Eden government was agitated by Nasser's campaign against the Baghdad Pact. In addition, Nasser's adherence to neutralism regarding the Cold War, recognition of communist China, and arms deal with the Eastern bloc alienated the United States. On 19 July 1956, the US and UK abruptly withdrew their offer to finance construction of the Aswan Dam, citing concerns that Egypt's economy would be overwhelmed by the project.|$|E

5|$|At home Ivan Alexander {{compromised}} {{the internal}} stability of his realm by divorcing {{his first wife}} Theodora of Wallachia (in about 1349) and marrying a converted Jew, also named Theodora. The new marriage produced new sons, whom Ivan Alexander proceeded to crown co-emperors, Ivan Šišman in about 1356 and Ivan Asen V by 1359. Ivan Alexander's last surviving son from his first marriage, the co-emperor Ivan Sracimir, became effectively independent around 1356; and Ivan Alexander's control over other powerful vassals, such as the rulers of Wallachia and Dobruja, who pursued their own <b>foreign</b> <b>policies,</b> was hardly stronger.|$|E

In Ireland, Elizabeth's forces ultimately prevailed, but their tactics stain her record. Rather than as a brave defender of the Protestant nations against Spain and the Habsburgs, she is more often regarded as cautious in her <b>foreign</b> <b>policies.</b> She offered very limited aid to foreign Protestants and failed to provide her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{concepts}} had become U.S. policy, Kennan began {{to criticize the}} <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> that he had seemingly helped begin. Subsequently, prior {{to the end of}} 1948, Kennan became confident that positive dialogue could commence with the Soviet government. His proposals were discounted by the Truman administration and Kennan's influence was marginalized, particularly after Dean Acheson was appointed Secretary of State in 1949. Soon thereafter, U.S. Cold War strategy assumed a more assertive and militaristic quality, causing Kennan to lament about what he believed was an abrogation of his previous assessments.|$|E
5|$|Alongside Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu (whom {{he succeeded}} as Premier), Tătărescu became a {{dominant}} {{figure in the}} group of maverick pro-Carol politicians. After a bloody crackdown on the Iron Guard, the Front attempted to reunite political forces in a national government that was to back Carol's <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> in view of increasing threats on Romania's borders after the outbreak of World War II. In 1945, Tătărescu stressed his belief that authoritarianism benefited Romania, and supported the view that Carol had meant to keep Romania out of the war. Tătărescu's second cabinet was meant to reflect the latter policies, but it did not draw any support from traditional parties, and, in April 1940, Carol, assisted by Ernest Urdăreanu and Mihail Ghelmegeanu, began talks with the (by then much weaker) Iron Guard.|$|E
5|$|By 1258, Henry's {{rule was}} {{increasingly}} unpopular, {{the result of}} the failure of his expensive <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'état and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.|$|E

5|$|Historical sources {{confirm that}} the Macedonian kings before Philip II at least upheld the {{privileges}} and responsibilities of hosting foreign diplomats, initiating the kingdom's <b>foreign</b> <b>policies,</b> and negotiating deals such as alliances with foreign powers. After the Greek victory at Salamis in 480 BC, the Persian commander Mardonius had Alexander I of Macedon sent to Athens as a chief envoy to orchestrate an alliance between the Achaemenid Empire and Athens. The decision to send Alexander was based on his marriage alliance with a noble Persian house and his previous formal relationship with the city-state of Athens. With their ownership of natural resources including gold, silver, timber, and royal land, the early Macedonian kings were also capable of bribing foreign and domestic parties with impressive gifts.|$|E

5|$|The wider {{political}} environment in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries was also volatile. For centuries {{the relationship with}} the Confederation's powerful neighbour, France, determined the <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> of the Swiss. Nominally, the Confederation formed a part of the Holy Roman Empire. However, through a succession of wars culminating in the Swabian War in 1499, the Confederation had become de facto independent. As the two continental powers and minor regional states such as the Duchy of Milan, the Duchy of Savoy, and the Papal States competed and fought against each other, there were far-reaching political, economic, and social consequences for the Confederation. During this time the mercenary pension system became a subject of disagreement. The religious factions of Zwingli's time debated vociferously the merits of sending young Swiss men to fight in foreign wars mainly for the enrichment of the cantonal authorities.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{to what extent}} Indonesia’s transition to democracy has impacted Jakarta’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> particularly regarding the foreign policy-making process, its fundamental doctrine, and <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> strategies in three specific areas: regional cooperation in ASEAN, promotion of political values, and conflict management. The puzzle this thesis addresses is that Indonesia’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> in many ways does not conform to expectations generated by theoretical works on democratization and <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> The dissertation argues that Indonesia’s democratisation has affected Jakarta’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> only in a mixed and limited fashion. While Indonesia’s democratisation has shaped ideas that have influenced Indonesia’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> some traditional <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> pillars continue to be relevant. First, notwithstanding Indonesia’s democratic transition, Jakarta remains committed {{to the principle of}} an independent and active (bebas-aktif) <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> As such, maintaining a balanced presence of big powers remains a key explanation for Indonesia’s policies on East Asia cooperation. Second, while democratisation has led to the proliferation of <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> actors, <b>foreign</b> policy-making remains largely unaltered, with the president and the foreign minister serving as the central decision-makers. However, democratisation has changed the substance or style of Indonesian <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> and such a change is discernible in efforts to shape political cooperation in ASEAN, Jakarta’s management of conflict on Ambalat dispute with Malaysia, and its Myanmar policy. Additionally, democracy and human rights now prominently feature in Indonesia’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> strategy towards the wider Asia. Significantly, however, while democracy promotion has been driven by the desire of Indonesia’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> leaders to reflect its newfound identity, human rights promotion has been lacking in Indonesia’s promotion of political values abroad due to domestic considerations. Hence, frameworks focusing on the role of identity and ideas in <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> flowing from democratization offer an important, yet insufficient explanation of Indonesia’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> in the cases discussed. Using an integrative approach that draws on works on the role of leaders, the salience of institutions, and the influence of identity and ideas in <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> this study contributes to the wider discussion about the relationship between democratisation and <b>foreign</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of key issues related to <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> and <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> theories in the wider context of political science. Discussing the origins and development of <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> analysis (FPA), as well as scholarly work produced over time, it argues that today FPA encompasses a variety of theoretical approaches, models and tools.

Furthermore, this paper conceptualizes <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> by comparing it to other types of policy. Although during the Cold War period <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> was equated with <b>foreign</b> security <b>policy,</b> in today’s world, security policy is only one dimension. <b>Foreign</b> <b>policy’s</b> scope has expanded to cover other issues such as trade, human rights and the environment.
