The objective of this thesis was {{the details of the}} strategy of migraine treatment. In addition, other things will be discussed: pathophysiology, and clinical signs of migraine, specific and non-specific therapy, treatment of status migreneous, surgical and alternative therapy.

25|$|Under {{ordinary}} conditions, {{the colon}} receives between 10% and 35% {{of the total}} cardiac output. If {{blood flow to the}} colon drops by more than about 50%, ischemia will develop. The arteries feeding the colon are very sensitive to vasoconstrictors; presumably this is an evolutionary adaptation to shunt blood away from the bowel and to the heart and brain in times of stress. As a result, during periods of low blood pressure, the arteries feeding the colon clamp down vigorously; a similar process can result from vasoconstricting drugs such as <b>ergotamine,</b> cocaine, or vasopressors. This vasoconstriction can result in non-occlusive ischemic colitis.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{involves}} decreasing known {{risk factors}} including if possible procedures {{associated with the}} condition and giving the medication oxytocin to stimulate the uterus to contract shortly after the baby is born. Misoprostol may be used instead of oxytocin in resource poor settings. Treatments may include: intravenous fluids, blood transfusions, and the medication <b>ergotamine</b> to cause further uterine contraction. Efforts to compress the uterus using the hands may be effective if other treatments do not work. The aorta may also be compressed by pressing on the abdomen.

25|$|Erythromycin is metabolized by enzymes of the {{cytochrome}} P450 system, in particular, by isozymes of the CYP3A superfamily, CYP3A. The {{activity of}} the CYP3A enzymes can be induced or inhibited by certain drugs (e.g. dexamethasone) which can cause it to affect the metabolism of many different drugs, e.g. erythromycin. If other CYP3A substrates — drugs that are broken down by CYP3A — such as simvastatin (Zocor), lovastatin (Mevacor), or atorvastatin (Lipitor)—are taken concomitantly with erythromycin, levels of the substrates increase, often causing adverse effects. A noted drug interaction involves erythromycin and simvastatin, resulting in increased simvastatin levels {{and the potential for}} rhabdomyolysis. Another group of CYP3A4 substrates are drugs used for migraine such as <b>ergotamine</b> and dihydroergotamine; their adverse effects may be more pronounced if erythromycin is associated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Migraine is {{a common}} {{disabling}} primary headache disorder. Despite {{the need for a}} perfect treatment of this debilitating condition, the ideal “cure ” eludes us. In 1992, the first triptan was released in the US for use in acute migraine. Triptans are more specific for the serotonin receptor 5 -hydroxy triptamine (5 -HT) 1 than previously prescribed drugs, such as <b>ergotamines,</b> with fewer side effects. This was an important first step in specific acute migraine therapy. Today however, triptans continue to be underutilized. There remains a concern, among practitioners and patients, about possible cardiovascular safety issues, despite the lack of strong evidence of serious adverse events. In fact, triptans now have a safe track record over {{more than a decade of}} use. Other perceived downfalls to use, include cost and variable efficacy. The more we learn about the clinical features and pathophysiology of migraine, the closer we are to finding a satisfactory monotherapy. Until then, recognizing that mixed mechanisms underlie migraine symptoms, rational polytherapy can be useful. Research on the roles of serotonin, calcitonin gene related peptide, glutamine and N-methyl-D-aspartate in the trigeminovascular system holds promise for those searching for the perfect migraine headache cure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the treat-ment {{patterns}} of migraine and tension-type headache in the Croatian population. Analysis included the proportion of patients who were taking specific antimigraine therapy and the number of tablets per attack per month, the proportion of patients who were taking prophylactic therapy or using alternative treatment methods and their satisfaction with the treatment. The design of the study was a cross-sectional survey. Self-completed questionnaires were randomly dis-tributed to adults [18 years of age in the Croatian popu-lation. A total of 616 questionnaires were analyzed: 115 patients with migraine (M), 327 patients with tension-type headache (TTH), and 174 patients with probable migraine (PM) and TTH. Specific antimigraine therapy was taken by half of patients with migraine: 35. 7 % of patients used triptans and 21. 7 % <b>ergotamines.</b> Prophylactic treatment had been used by 13. 9 % of M, 1. 2 % of TTH, and 6. 9 % of PM patients. Alternative methods of treatment were tried by 27 % of M and TTH patients. Only 16. 8 % of patients with M pay regular visits to physicians, while 36. 3 % never visited a physician. More than half of TTH patients have never visited a physician. The majority of patients are only partially satisfied with their current treatment, and almost one-third are not satisfied.

40|$|We studied genetic {{variability}} of 100 isolates of Claviceps purpurea by using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), an EcoRI restriction site polymorphism in the 5. 8 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), the alkaloids produced, and conidial morphology. We identified three groups: (i) group G 1 from fields and open meadows (57 isolates), (ii) group G 2 from shady or wet habitats (41 isolates), and (iii) group G 3 from Spartina anglica from salt marshes (2 isolates). The sclerotia of G 1 isolates contained <b>ergotamines</b> and ergotoxines; G 2 isolates produced ergosine and ergocristine along with {{small amounts of}} ergocryptine; and G 3 isolates produced ergocristine and ergocryptine. The conidia of G 1 isolates were 5 to 8 μm long, the conidia of G 2 isolates were 7 to 10 μm long, and the conidia of G 3 isolates were 10 to 12 μm long. Sclerotia of the G 2 and G 3 isolates floated on water. In the 5. 8 S rDNA analysis, an EcoRI site was found in G 1 and G 3 isolates but not in G 2 isolates. The host preferences of the groups were not absolute, and there were host genera that were common to both G 1 and G 2; the presence of members of different groups in the same locality was rare. Without the use of RAPD or rDNA polymorphism, {{it was not possible}} to distinguish the three groups solely on the basis of phenotype, host, or habitat. In general, populations of C. purpurea are not host specialized, as previously assumed, but they are habitat specialized, and collecting strategies and toxin risk assessments should be changed to reflect this paradigm shift...|$|R
25|$|Many {{secondary}} metabolites from endophyte-plant interactions {{have also}} been isolated and used in raw or derived forms to produce a variety of drugs treating many conditions.

Drugs used to treat Parkinson's Disease have been created from isolates of ergot toxins, although health risks may accompany their use. <b>Ergotamine</b> has also been used to synthesize lysergic acid diethylamide because of its chemical similarity to lysergic acid. The generally chemically-based defense properties of endophytic fungi make them a perfect group of organisms to search for new antibiotic compounds within, as other fungi have in the past yielded such useful drugs as penicillin and streptomycin and plants use their antibiotic qualities as a defense against pathogens.|$|E

40|$|Migraine is {{a chronic}} {{neurological}} disorder characterized by recurrent {{moderate to severe}} headaches, associated {{with a number of}} autonomic nervous system symptoms. Migraine constitutes 16 % of primary headaches affecting 10 - 20 % of general population according to International Headache Society. Typically the headache is unilateral (affecting one half of the head) and pulsating in nature, lasting from 2 to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia and the pain is generally aggravated by physical activity. Globally, approximately 15 % of the population is affected by migraine at some point in life. Initial recommended management is with simple analgesics such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen for the headache, an antiemetic for the nausea, and the avoidance of triggers. Specific agents such as triptans or <b>ergotamines</b> may be used by those for whom simple analgesics are not effective. All the already available drugs have certain limitations. Either they are unable to produce complete relief or 30 - 40 % patients are no responders or drugs produce adverse effects. A new class of drugs like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists have recently been studied for their off label use in prophylaxis of migraine. Studies done so far, have shown results in favour of their clinical use because of the ability to reduce number of days with headache, number of days with migraine, hours with migraine, headache severity index, level of disability, improved Quality of life and decrease in consumption of specific or nonspecific analgesics.

40|$|The {{growth of}} fungi on food causes {{physical}} and chemical changes which, further affect negatively the sensory and nutritive quality of food. Species from genera: Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, Alternariа, Cladosporium, Mucor, Rhizopus, Eurotium and Emericella are usually found. Some of them are potentially dangerous for humans and animals, due to possible synthesis and excretion of toxic secondary metabolites - mycotoxins into the food. Their toxic syndroms in animals and humans are known as mycotoxicoses. The pathologic changes {{can be observed in}} parenhimatic organs, and in bones and central nervous system also. Specific conditions are necessary for mycotoxin producing fungi to synthetize sufficient quantities of these compounds for demonstration of biologic effects. The main biochemical paths in the formation of mycotoxins include the polyketide (aflatoxins, sterigmatocystin, zearalenone, citrinine, patulin), terpenic (trichothecenes), aminoacid (glicotoxins, <b>ergotamines,</b> sporidesmin, malformin C), and carbonic acids path (rubratoxins). Aflatoxins are the most toxigenic metabolites of fungi, produced mostly by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus species. Aflatoxins appear more frequently in food in the tropic and subtropic regions, while the food in Europe is more exposed to also very toxic ochratoxin A producing fungi (A. ochraceus and some Penicillium species). The agricultural products can be contaminated by fungi {{both before and after the}} harvest. The primary mycotoxicoses in humans are the result of direct intake of vegetable products contaminated by mycotoxins, while the secondary mycotoxicoses are caused by products of animal origin. The risk of the presence of fungi and mycotoxin in food is increasing, having in mind that some of them are highly thermoresistent, and the temperatures of usual food sterilization is not sufficient for their termination. The paper presents the review of most important mycotoxins, their biologic effects, the condition of their synthesis, occurence in food, permitted tolerant intake, as well as the possibility of their degradation.

2500|$|Chronic {{headache}}, {{or chronic}} daily headache (CDH), {{is classified as}} experiencing fifteen or more days with a headache per month. It is estimated that chronic headaches affect [...] "4% to 5% of the general population". Chronic headaches consist of different sub-groups, primarily categorized as chronic tension-type headaches and chronic migraine headaches. The treatments for chronic headache are vast and varied. Medicinal and non-medicinal methods exist to help patients cope with chronic headache, because chronic headaches cannot be cured. Whether pharmacological or not, treatment plans are often created on an individual basis. Multiple sources recommend multimodal treatment, which {{is a combination of}} medicinal and non-medicinal remedies. The long term use of opioids; however, appears to result in greater harm than benefit. Also, abortive medications can be used to [...] "stop a headache once it has begun"; such drugs include <b>ergotamine</b> (Cafergot), triptans (Imitrex), and prednisone (Deltasone). However, medical professionals advise that abuse of analgesics and abortive medications can actually lead to an increase in headaches. The painkiller medicines help headaches temporarily, but as the [...] "quick fix" [...] wears off, headaches become more re-current and grow in intensity. These [...] "rebound headaches" [...] can actually make the body less responsive to preventive medication. The conditions keep worsening if one takes paracetamol, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 15 days a month or more.
