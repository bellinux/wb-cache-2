5000|$|Originally, George {{was going}} to claim to be an {{employee}} of the real Tyson Chicken. However, when Seinfeld inquired about the right to use their name, executives at Tyson Chicken objected to the joke about [...] "alcoholic chicken" [...] and the fictional [...] "Tyler Chicken" [...] was used in its place. One Tyson Foods Inc. spokesman, Archie Schaffer, told business news reporter Bill Bowden, [...] "We told them the only problem we had with the whole concept was the alcoholic chickens concept didn't make a whole lot of sense to us, and it wasn't funny. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> drink or a drunk chicken?" [...] Schaffer suggested using [...] "chicken brewskis" [...] instead; another spokesman, Ed Nicholson, remarked, [...] "There were some inaccuracies. George was supposed to have worked on the hen line. Of course, there is no hen line." ...|$|E
3000|$|The {{question}} of power <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> felt very strong about, but didn’t write much about. Why? [...]...|$|R
2500|$|... "Fashion <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can {{attach to}} yourself, put on, and through that interaction, {{the meaning of}} it is born." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't. Cant <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't {{believe in}} yourself. It's tommyrot: there isn't any other word. When I'm in love it will <b>be</b> with <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> real." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-night, my dear," [...] said Sir John. [...] "I don't know what's {{the matter}} with you, but you look as though you'd <b>been</b> doing <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> ashamed of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> {{not sure}} <b>that</b> I do," [...] she answered. [...] "But at least I {{understand}} <b>you.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>something!</b> <b>You</b> {{want to go}} on as you are--apart from me. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> true, isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Mrs. Makely assented, [...] "I {{suppose it}} is. All foreigners find it so. In fact, it <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have to live}} into the notion of; it can't be explained." ...|$|R
50|$|As long as {{something}} wasn’t submitted as illegal or an abuse complaint, I didn’t even see it. Wikis <b>are</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> either closely, closely monitor and manage, or {{you just let}} it go.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2009, she {{questioned}} former Vice President Al Gore {{during an}} energy-related congressional hearing: [...] "The legislation <b>that</b> we <b>are</b> discussing here today, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to personally benefit from?". The Independent, a London-based periodical, has credited her for [...] "famously putGore {{on the spot}} about his business interests in the energy industry" [...] during this confrontation. [...] Gore vociferously refuted the implied accusation, claiming every penny he makes from renewable technology investment goes to non-profits.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is all, then," [...] {{the other}} concluded. [...] "You {{know where to}} send or bring the chart when you have it? If you bring it yourself, it <b>is</b> {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>something</b> which <b>you</b> may regard as a reward, will be offered to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not to me? I {{should not}} like you the less for telling me. Do tell me." [...] And she pressed her hand again upon his arm. [...] "I have known there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> made <b>you</b> unhappy." ...|$|R
60|$|DOOLITTLE. I shouldn't mind if it {{had only}} {{happened}} to me: anything might happen to anybody and nobody to blame but Providence, as you might say. But this <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> done to me: yes, you, Henry Higgins.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, sir," [...] said Frank. He {{paused for}} a moment, and then resumed--"Well, there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> perhaps <b>you</b> could do, sir. I have a little brother out of employment; {{if you could get}} him a situation, sir." ...|$|R
2500|$|Morgan is {{also known}} for her {{turbulent}} personal life, having been married six times. In a July 2004 appearance on Larry King Live, she told Larry King <b>that</b> [...] "drama <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> lets <b>you</b> know you're still alive." ...|$|R
50|$|If {{you try to}} {{encourage}} more openness, and at first others are unresponsive or hesitant to participate, consider asking someone you trust after the meeting if there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might have missed or could have done differently to achieve the desired result".|$|R
50|$|A {{reflexive}} action <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do to yourself. A reciprocal {{action is}} something people do to each other. Reciprocals must {{have at least}} two people involved. They are formed with the reflexive marker and the dualic prepronominal prefix discussed in section 3.4.1.1.2.4. Here is an example.|$|R
6000|$|She {{spoke at}} last {{because she could}} put it off no longer, rather than because the right time had come. She began as they sat at breakfast. [...] "Papa, there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> I have got to tell <b>you.</b> It <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> ought to know; but I have put off telling you because--" ...|$|R
5000|$|In Spain [...] "tocar madera" [...] (literally: {{to touch}} wood) <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{say when you}} want your luck or a good {{situation}} to continue. Ha ido bien toda la semana y, toco madera, seguirá bien el fin de semana. (It's been fine all week and, touch wood, it'll stay fine for the weekend).|$|R
5000|$|Interviewed by the Associated Press in Baltimore in December 2006, Mol commented {{about how}} she {{maintained}} her confidence as an actress: [...] "It is an ongoing struggle. Confidence <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> sometimes <b>you</b> have and sometimes you don't. And the older you get, hopefully, the more you have some tools to at least fake it".|$|R
40|$|It is March already, the tillage {{equipment}} is being readied, {{and we are}} thinking eagerly about planting the 2008 crop of corn. Yet it seems a long time until {{we have to worry}} about corn rootworm larval feeding on the corn roots. However, there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should <b>be</b> thinking about now, before you plant the corn...|$|R
40|$|Reducing food {{costs and}} {{evaluating}} ingredient prices shouldn’t <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{do when you}} are in financial trouble. Rather this should be a standard practice every time <b>you</b> put <b>something</b> on the menu, every element of every dish from what appears on your menu permanently right down to the daily specials every dish should be cost correctly...|$|R
5000|$|... "Art shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> go {{quietly into}} {{an art gallery}} and dip your forelock and say 'I {{have to be very}} quiet, I'm in here amongst the art.' It's here, art's everywhere. It's how you use your eyes. It's about the {{enjoyment}} of visual things. And it's certainly not for any one group of people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I thank you," [...] she continued, [...] "for {{having come}} to me frankly and openly, and told me everything. It <b>is</b> still <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have {{confidence}} in me. You need never fear that I shall feel bitter towards you. I can see that you have suffered--perhaps more than you have made me suffer. Good-bye!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In June 2014 Bill Moyes, former Monitor {{executive}} chair, {{urged the}} NHS to reconsider “whether {{the model of}} foundation trusts is sensible”, arguing “If one-third of the hospital system is permanently not demonstrating good viability and good governance, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> telling <b>you</b> <b>something</b> about actually how the system should run as opposed to how we thought it should run?” ...|$|R
5000|$|David Nordahl {{was born}} in Albert Lea, Minnesota in 1941. Of his early years, Nordahl stated: [...] "I can't {{remember}} not drawing. I had an abusive, alcoholic father, and drawing <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> takes <b>you</b> out of the real world. I was always interested in cowboys and Indians. I sold drawings of the Lone Ranger to my classmates." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I wasn't {{really having}} a good time playing football. It wasn't fun for me. It wasn't a blast for me..."Making that much money - <b>that</b> <b>was</b> fun. But money is still a {{material}} thing. You can always make money. You can't make that time that you lose with your friends and your loved ones. Time <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can never get back." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It doesn't matter. You must {{arrive at}} an image you {{continue}} to learn from long after it <b>was</b> taken. <b>Something</b> <b>that</b> draws <b>you</b> in and allows you to explore {{the dynamics of the}} situation you reacted to and recorded, perhaps quite instinctively, in greater depth.'The contemplation of things as they are is in itself a nobler thing than a whole harvest of invention.' (Francis Bacon)" ...|$|R
500|$|During {{his time}} at the United States Department of State, Keyes defended the Reagan policy of not {{imposing}} economic sanctions on South Africa as punishment for apartheid. Stated Keyes, [...] "I see the black people in South Africa as the most critical positive factor for eliminating apartheid and building the future of that country... And <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> do with rhetoric, slogans and noninvolvement. It's not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> will achieve through disinvestment." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mamet {{himself has}} said: People do not {{understand}} The Woods very well — I think partly {{because it is a}} play about heterosexuality, which is just not a hot theatrical topic over here. It <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> look at in the popular media, a subject that people would rather not address — why men and women have a hard time trying to get along with each other.|$|R
5000|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Like {{the best}} of personal, {{independent}} cinema [...] [...] [...] it is both marvelously observed and completely individual. There is no film like this film, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> don't hear every day [...] [...] [...] it's so accurate about how people attempt meaningful emotional connections in an uncaring world of self-involvement, obtuseness and free-floating insecurity that {{it ought to be}} put in a time capsule." ...|$|R
5000|$|Responding to a {{question}} about his song, [...] "I Made It", Rudolf elaborated on his own feelings regarding success. [...] "I think <b>that</b> 'making it' <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do in stages. There's a certain feeling of 'I made it' when you have a hit on the radio {{for the first time and}} people are feeling it and buying it and reacting to it at shows. But I've also set new goals since then." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I don't {{like the}} term Method, {{but for the}} sake of {{argument}} method acting is a means to an end. It <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> helps <b>you</b> get involved in the part personally so that you can communicate with the audience. No matter what, the American actor of the fifties changed acting the world over. Montgomery Clift was perhaps the actor who started it, Brando caused the sensation and James Dean made it a cult".|$|R
6000|$|Later.--When the Professor came in, {{we talked}} {{over the state}} of things. I could see <b>that</b> he had <b>something</b> on his mind, which he wanted to say, but felt some hesitancy about {{broaching}} the subject. After beating about the bush a little, he said, [...] "Friend John, there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and I must talk of alone, just at the first at any rate. Later, {{we may have to}} take the others into our confidence." ...|$|R
5000|$|We were {{a totally}} new company moving to a foreign country, and, ah, I don't we kind of {{expected}} it to go [...] "boom", and just fly right in. We had no expectations; we didn't really know that many people, and we actually just wanted to skate, really. Because we grew up dreaming of living in California and getting to wake up every day {{and go out and}} skate without it raining. Ah, and I think <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that,</b> like, all of the guys, when we first moved here, you know, Rune Glifberg and Tom Penny, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> couldn't hold us back in that respect. I'd just turned eighteen, Tom was seventeen, ah, neither of us had lived away from home, you know. We'd moved to a foreign country where we didn't know anybody. Nobody. Ah, we had no money, we didn't have any cars, ah, alls we had <b>was</b> the board <b>that</b> we had; we couldn't go breaking those. we couldn't afford to, at the time, starting a company, we couldn't afford to run through ten boards a month ... Like myself, personally, I skated a lot with Ed Templeton, like, every day, because he lived, like, right across the road from me.|$|R
50|$|The {{pressures}} {{of these kids}} mirror those of a major league baseball team on any given day. On most days these kids are playing in front of crowds of 45,000 people who are hanging onto their every pitch. This is more fans than some major league teams can only dream about having in their own stadiums. Most of the star pitchers are throwing about 200 pitches on short rest which <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will never even see anymore in the major leagues.|$|R
5000|$|... "Lonnie Donegan {{inspired}} everyone {{play guitar}} {{because he made}} it look {{as though it was}} possible to do. But who really moved it out of just playing acoustic to electric was all those people <b>that</b> <b>were</b> playing in the 1950s. Initially, it was the rockabilly-style guitar, the Johnny Burnette Rock and Roll Trio. When you heard <b>that,</b> it <b>was</b> just <b>something</b> <b>that</b> inspired <b>you</b> so much to want to play out of the box as it's so abstract, the guitar playing." ...|$|R
