5|$|The {{choice of}} a {{shielding}} gas depends on several factors, most importantly the type of material being welded and the process variation being used. Pure inert gases such as argon and helium are only used for nonferrous welding; with steel they do not provide adequate weld penetration (argon) or cause an <b>erratic</b> <b>arc</b> and encourage spatter (with helium). Pure carbon dioxide, on the other hand, allows for deep penetration welds but encourages oxide formation, which adversely affect the mechanical properties of the weld. lts low cost makes it an attractive choice, {{but because of the}} reactivity of the arc plasma, spatter is unavoidable and welding thin materials is difficult. As a result, argon and carbon dioxide are frequently mixed in a 75%/25% to 90%/10% mixture. Generally, in short circuit GMAW, higher carbon dioxide content increases the weld heat and energy when all other weld parameters (volts, current, electrode type and diameter) are held the same. As the carbon dioxide content increases over 20%, spray transfer GMAW becomes increasingly problematic, especially with smaller electrode diameters.|$|E
50|$|Helium {{is lighter}} than air; larger flow rates are required. It is an inert gas, not {{reacting}} with the molten metals. Its thermal conductivity is high. It {{is not easy}} to ionize, requiring higher voltage to start the arc. Due to higher ionization potential it produces hotter arc at higher voltage, provides wide deep bead; this is an advantage for aluminium, magnesium, and copper alloys. Other gases are often added. Blends of helium with addition of 5-10% of argon and 2-5% of carbon dioxide ("tri-mix") can be used for welding of stainless steel. Used also for aluminium and other non-ferrous metals, especially for thicker welds. In comparison with argon, helium provides more energy-rich but less stable arc. Helium and carbon dioxide were the first shielding gases used, since the beginning of World War 2. Helium is used as a shield gas in laser welding for carbon dioxide lasers. Helium is more expensive than argon and requires higher flow rates, so despite its advantages {{it may not be a}} cost-effective choice for higher-volume production. Pure helium is not used for steel, as it then provides <b>erratic</b> <b>arc</b> and encourages spatter.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the problem associated with accidents in the aerial line (AL) ultra-high voltage (UHV) {{due to its}} big length. In lines with a voltage of 500 - 1150 kV the overwhelming proportion of trips (98 %) is caused by single-phase short circuit (SPSC). A substantial portion (70 %) single-phase short circuits is <b>erratic</b> <b>arc</b> accidents which can be successfully eliminated in a high-speed auto-reclosing (HSAR) or single-phase auto-reclosing (SPAR). Success single-phase auto-reclosing (SPAR) at liquidation by single-phase short circuit (SPSC), on the one hand, {{is determined by the}} characteristics of the secondary arc current, {{and on the other hand}} the effectiveness of ways to reduce secondary arc current and recovery voltage development. The minimum dead time, at a HSAR it is usually taken as 0. 5 s., at single-phase autoreclosing (SPAR) it depends on the current value of the arc support is in the range of 0. 5 - 3. 0 s. The article shows high efficiency of use single-phase auto reclosing (SPAR) at liquidation SPSC in a single-chain AL voltage of 500 kV, the dependence of the bandwidth of transmission in maintaining the dynamic stability from the length of the pause SPAR...|$|E
