40|$|BackgroundFood insecurity, {{uncertainty}} about the ability to acquire adequate food, is associated with cardiometabolic disease in pregnant women. Whether food insecurity interventions improve cardiometabolic health is unknown. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of women who visited the obstetrics clinic in a community health center from 2013 through 2015. Patients could be referred to the Food <b>for</b> <b>Families</b> (Food <b>for</b> <b>Families)</b> program, which connects food insecure women to food resources. We hypothesized that participation in Food <b>for</b> <b>Families</b> {{would be associated with}} better blood pressure and blood glucose trends during pregnancy. We used a propensity score 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cmatched design to reduce bias from differential entry into Food <b>for</b> <b>Families.</b> ResultsEleven percent of women who visited the obstetrics clinic were referred to Food <b>for</b> <b>Families.</b> In propensity score 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cmatched analyses, we found no difference in baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) between those who were referred and enrolled in Food <b>for</b> <b>Families</b> (113. 5 mm Hg), those who were referred and did not enroll in Food <b>for</b> <b>Families</b> (113. 9 mm Hg), and those who were not referred to Food <b>for</b> <b>Families</b> (114 mm Hg) (P =. 79). However, during pregnancy, women who were referred to and enrolled in Food <b>for</b> <b>Families</b> had a better SBP trend (0. 2015 mm Hg/wk lower, P =. 006). SBP trends did not differ between women who were referred and did not enroll in Food <b>for</b> <b>Families</b> and those who were not referred. We observed no differences in blood glucose trends between groups (P =. 40). ConclusionsFood <b>for</b> <b>Families</b> participation was associated with better blood pressure trends in pregnant women but no differences in blood glucose trends. Food insecurity reduction programs may improve cardiovascular health for vulnerable pregnant women, and this topic deserves further study incorporating randomized program entry. 27809418 PMC 509485...|$|R

However, he proceeded to give a blunt 15-minute speech, claiming that he had lost the art of communicating with the players and expressing his disenchantment with some aspects of the game, a reference to the declining player conduct. After relocating to the Gold Coast, he was unable to turn his back on cricket, and umpired matches at local level into his 70s. Although he became severely visually impaired, Loxton still attended matches and asked his companions to describe the proceedings for him; ever opinionated and blunt, he still offered advice to local cricketers.|$|E
