5|$|British wartime {{participation}} in the Manhattan Project provided a substantial body of <b>expertise</b> <b>that</b> was crucial {{to the success of}} High Explosive Research, the United Kingdom's post-war nuclear weapons programme, although it was not without important gaps, such as in the field of plutonium metallurgy. The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958, and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E
5|$|Countries with {{decades of}} {{experience}} in comprehensive emergency medical systems have <b>expertise</b> <b>that</b> nations that are just beginning emergency medical programs lack. Thus, there exists considerable opportunity for the transfer of knowledge to assist newly founded programs. Such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person. For instance, the International Emergency Medicine Fellowship at the University of Toronto sent a three-person team to Cluj-Napoca, Romania, to promote the local development of emergency medicine. An assessment of the present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization and patient flow; staffing, staff education, equipment, medication and supplies; and infection control practices. Following these designations, plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented, partially through international exchange trips.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} a civil, not a military, one. Staff {{were drawn from}} and {{recruited}} into the Civil Service, and were paid Civil Service salaries. It was headed by Lord Portal, as Controller of Production, Atomic Energy, in the Ministry of Supply. An Atomic Energy Research Establishment was located at a former airfield, Harwell, in Berkshire, {{under the direction of}} John Cockcroft. The first nuclear reactor in the UK, a small research reactor known as GLEEP, went critical at Harwell on 15 August 1947. British staff at the Montreal Laboratory designed a larger reactor, known as BEPO, which went critical on 5 July 1948. They provided experience and <b>expertise</b> <b>that</b> would later be employed on the larger, production reactors.|$|E

25|$|The {{benefit of}} {{skinning}} in user interfaces is disputed.

25|$|The {{utilization}} of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation {{has not yet}} been fully and widely validated.

25|$|Annuities {{provide a}} stream of {{payments}} and are generally classified as insurance because they are issued by insurance companies, are regulated as insurance, and require {{the same kinds of}} actuarial and investment management <b>expertise</b> <b>that</b> life insurance requires.

25|$|The Bristol Unit has {{suffered}} {{along with the}} rest of the BBC from recent staff cuts. Yet it remains confident in the belief that the BBC will maintain it, in spite of the vagaries of fashion, because the Corporation believes that such programmes deserve a place in the schedules of any broadcaster with pretensions of providing a Public Service. In due course, similar specialist Units were also established in London, in order to produce programmes on archaeology and history, on the arts, on music and on science. They too, at one time, had their successes. But they have not survived as well as the Unit in Bristol. The statutory requirement that a certain percentage of programmes must come from independent producers has reduced in-house production and the Units necessarily shrank proportionately in size. As they dwindled, so the critical mass of their production expertise has diminished. The continuity of their archives has been broken, they have lost the close touch they once had worldwide with their subjects and they are no longer regarded internationally as the centres of innovation and <b>expertise</b> <b>that</b> they once were.|$|E
500|$|The {{engineers}} {{working on}} the sound-on-disc system were able to draw on <b>expertise</b> <b>that</b> Western Electric already had in electrical disc recording and were thus able to make faster initial progress. The main change required was to increase the playing time of the disc {{so that it could}} match that of a standard [...] reel of 35mm film. The chosen design used a disc nearly 16 inches (about 40cm) in diameter rotating at 331/3 rpm. This could play for 11 minutes, the running time of 1000ft of film at 90ft/min (24 frames/s). [...] Because of the larger diameter the minimum groove velocity of 70ft/min (14 inches or 356mm/s) was only slightly less than that of a standard 10-inch 78 rpm commercial disc.|$|E

500|$|The {{historian}} Hugh N.

Indeed, it was this [...] "revolutionary" [...] situation in the city as much as famine and the besiegers' professional <b>expertise,</b> <b>that</b> brought about its fall: in September 813, Tahir convinced some of the richer citizens to cut the pontoon bridges over the Tigris that connected the city to the outside world, allowing al-Ma'mun's men to occupy the city's eastern suburbs. Al-Ma'mun's troops then launched a final assault, in which al-Amin was captured and executed at Tahir's orders while trying to seek refuge with his old family friend Harthama.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} factors led to the {{popularity}} of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and <b>expertise</b> <b>that</b> developed in {{the region in the}} centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's [...] "library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.|$|E

[...] He rated the album a full five-out-of-five rating. Writing for AllMusic, Andy Kellman referred to Syro as [...] "one of James' most inviting and enjoyable releases" [...] {{and said the}} album is [...] "decked in accents and melodies that are lively even at their most distressed" [...] in his four-out-of-five-star review. Derek Staples of Consequence of Sound commented on the album's wide range of genres, including glitch, chillwave, techno, acid jazz and jungle, and said Syro [...] "peaks as Aphex Twin's most accessible album since his ambient works", ultimately giving the album a B+ rating. Pitchfork highlighted Syro {{as part of the}} publication's [...] "Best New Music"; editor Mark Richardson rated the album 8.7out of 10, writing that Syro [...] "has few extremes, no hyper-intense splatter-breaks or satanic 'Come to Daddy' vocals or rushes of noise. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum, Syro doesn't cast James in a quasi-classical light; there's no 'serious composer' tracks … without all that, what's left?
