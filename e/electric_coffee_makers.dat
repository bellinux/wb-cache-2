50|$|Domestic {{electrification}} simplified {{the operation}} of percolators by providing for a self-contained, electrically powered heating element that removed the {{need to use a}} stovetop burner. A critical element in the success of the <b>electric</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> was the creation of safe and secure fuses and heating elements. In an article in House Furnishing Review, May 1915, Lewis Stephenson of Landers, Frary and Clark described a modular safety plug being used in his company's Universal appliances, and the advent of numerous patents and innovations in temperature control and circuit breakers provided for the success of many new percolator and vacuum models. While early percolators had utilized all-glass construction (prized for maintaining purity of flavor), most percolators made from the 1930s were constructed of metal, especially aluminum and nickel-plated copper.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} study on {{maintainability}} {{of a domestic}} product from the aspect of design modularity. In the study, the clustering technique {{was applied to the}} domestic product, an <b>electric</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> in order to identify its functional components and the interactions between the components of the product. The service modes of the product were identified in order to ascertain the level of maintenance difficulty faced by the user. Guidelines in design for maintainability were applied during modification to the existing design, focusing on three components in the main module of the product namely the cover of the base, the spraying unit and the cover of the strainer aperture. Result from the study has shown that considerations on design modularity and maintainability requirements at the early stage of product design, has enabled product maintenance to be identified and planned in more systematic anb effective manner. The proposed new design would certainly enhance the maintainability of the product...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an account of}} material objects which {{are related to the}} nation in their design and consumption. Addressing a major gap both in design literature and in theories of everyday nationalism, the study focuses on the processes of design and consumption in which material objects are nationalised, rather than on objects as representative of nations. For this purpose, a material-semiotic theoretical framework is developed, contributing to current debates on the use of STS-based approaches in design research. Accordingly, design and consumption are viewed as two sociotechnical settings where a variety of actors-engineers, designers, users, other objects as well as nations-are brought together. In application of this framework, design and consumption of a nationally charged kitchen appliance, the <b>electric</b> Turkish <b>coffee</b> <b>maker,</b> was investigated for the ways in which Turkish nation is evoked in discourse and practice by the actors involved. To this end, interviews were conducted with the managers, designers and engineers involved in the development of <b>electric</b> Turkish <b>coffee</b> <b>makers.</b> Together with the documents collected, the data is used to piece together the processes of product development and design. These were complemented and contrasted with interviews, focus groups and participant observation sessions, organised with users of the product. The analysis shows that <b>electric</b> Turkish <b>coffee</b> <b>makers</b> are conceived as a national project, which translates Turkish coffee to national tradition, and global commercial success via its mechanisation to national responsibility and pride. Accordingly, design practice attempts to produce and maintain the products as objectifications of national cultural authenticity. In the analysed consumption setting, however, users appropriate the products not as authentic replacements of, but as convenient supplements to the 'authentic', which they instead utilise to improve sociability. The study suggests and illustrates that a comprehensive understanding of everyday nationalism in particular, and politics in general, requires taking seriously the material agency of objects- conceptualised as symbolic and material assemblages with politically substantial meanings and affordances. It thus emphasises the significance of designed objects as nodes in and around which relations of power are shaped and stored, and the political role of design practices in assembling these objects by mediating such relationsEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

[...] Despite his commercials for Mr. Coffee, Joe DiMaggio rarely drank coffee due to ulcers. However, when he did drink coffee, DiMaggio preferred Sanka instant coffee, rather than the coffee brewed by Mr. Coffee machines.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} reason to use electricity for all needs of a house, lighting, heat, power is because it will help women to work, increasing their efficiency, make living easier and comfortable, and also make it economical. There must be several electrical outlets in each room to easily use an appliance like electric heater. They also let occupants use electric light {{at any time and}} no one can forget the comfort of using appliances like an electric fan, an electric heater, an <b>electric</b> toaster, a <b>coffee</b> <b>maker,</b> an <b>electric</b> iron, and an electric curling iron.|$|R
50|$|An <b>electric</b> drip <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> {{can also}} be {{referred}} to as a dripolator. It normally works by admitting water from a cold water reservoir into a flexible hose in the base of the reservoir leading directly to a thin metal tube or heating chamber (usually, of aluminum), where a heating element surrounding the metal tube heats the water. The heated water moves through the machine using the thermosiphon principle. Thermally-induced pressure and the siphoning effect move the heated water through an insulated rubber or vinyl riser hose, into a spray head, and onto the ground coffee, which is contained in a brew basket mounted below the spray head. The coffee passes through a filter and drips down into the carafe. A one-way valve in the tubing prevents water from siphoning back into the reservoir. A thermostat attached to the heating element turns off the heating element as needed to prevent overheating the water in the metal tube (overheating would produce only steam in the supply hose), then turns back on when the water cools below a certain threshold. For a standard 10-12 cup drip coffeemaker, using a more powerful thermostatically-controlled heating element (in terms of wattage produced), can heat increased amounts of water more quickly using larger heating chambers, generally producing higher average water temperatures at the spray head over the entire brewing cycle. This process can be further improved by changing the aluminum construction of most heating chambers to a metal with superior heat transfer qualities, such as copper.|$|R

50|$|A vacuum <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> brews <b>coffee</b> {{using two}} {{chambers}} where vapor pressure and vacuum produce coffee. This type of <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> {{is also known}} as vac pot, siphon or syphon <b>coffee</b> <b>maker,</b> and was invented by Loeff of Berlin in the 1830s. These devices have since been used {{for more than a century}} in many parts of the world. Design and composition of the vacuum <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> varies. The chamber material is borosilicate glass, metal, or plastic, and the filter can be either a glass rod or a screen made of metal, cloth, paper, or nylon. The Napier Vacuum Machine, presented in 1840, was an early example of this technique. While vacuum <b>coffee</b> <b>makers</b> generally were excessively complex for everyday use, they were prized for producing a clear brew, and were quite popular until the middle of the twentieth century. The Bauhaus interpretation of this device can be seen in Gerhard Marcks' Sintrax <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> of 1925.|$|R
