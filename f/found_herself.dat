5|$|By April 1946, Gakushuin was reopened and Ono re-enrolled. The school, {{located near}} the Tokyo Imperial Palace, had not been damaged by the war, and Ono <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> a classmate of Prince Akihito, the future emperor of Japan. She {{graduated}} in 1951 and was accepted into the philosophy program of Gakushuin University as {{the first woman to}} enter the department. However, she left the school after two semesters.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} she {{completed}} Italian Food, Lehmann's publishing firm had been closed down by its parent company, and David <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> under contract to Macdonald, another imprint within the same group. She intensely disliked the company and wrote a most unflattering portrait {{of it in a}} 1985 article. Disliking the approach to her books that the company took, she left Macdonald and signed a contract with the publisher Museum Press for her next book, Summer Cooking, which was published in 1955.|$|E
5|$|David's third book {{differed}} from its predecessors {{in that it}} drew little from anything she had already written. She spent many months in Italy researching it before starting work on the typescript. While she was away, the firm of her publisher, John Lehman, was closed down by its principal shareholder, and she <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> under contract to the far less congenial company, Macdonald.|$|E

50|$|In 1248, Blanche again became regent, during Louis IX's absence on the Crusade, {{a project}} {{which she had}} {{strongly}} opposed. In the disasters which followed she maintained peace, while draining the land of men and money to aid her son in the East. She fell ill at Melun in November 1252, and was taken to Paris, but lived only a few days. She was buried at Maubuisson Abbey, which she had <b>founded</b> <b>herself.</b> Louis heard of her death in the following spring and reportedly did not speak to anyone for two days afterwards.|$|R

5|$|DeGeneres began {{negotiating}} with ABC in 1996 to have Morgan come out. When {{word of the}} negotiations got out, DeGeneres <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> {{at the center of}} intense speculation about when she or her character, or both, would come out. With DeGeneres hinting at her and her character's coming out both off-screen and within the show, the rumors were confirmed when the episode went into production in March 1997.|$|E
5|$|In November 2009 Manning {{wrote to}} a gender {{counselor}} in the United States, said she felt female, and discussed having surgery. The counselor told Steve Fishman of New York magazine in 2011 that it was clear Manning was in crisis, partly because of her gender concerns, but also because she was opposed {{to the kind of}} war in which she <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> involved.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} with Stephen was not set to last long. The arrival in England of the Empress Matilda gave David {{an opportunity to}} renew the conflict with Stephen. In either May or June, David travelled {{to the south of}} England and entered Matilda's company; he was present for her expected coronation at Westminster Abbey, though this never took place. David was there until September, when the Empress <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> surrounded at Winchester.|$|E
50|$|She {{started her}} career in the Ministry of Finance in 1971, moved to the Secretariat for Future Studies and then spent the 1980s in the trade union {{movement}} — first at the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO), then at the LO-TCO Secretariat of International Trade Union Development, later at the Confederation of Nordic Trade Unions (NFS) secretariat, and finally at the white collar union TCO. During the 1990s she was an MP and then an MEP, before becoming a county governor and deputy governor of the Swedish central bank. From 2007 she led the think tank Global Challenge, which she had <b>founded</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kyouyaku Yume is a blue-haired {{girl with}} no {{recollection}} of her identity and past. With a vaguely written clue and a turquoise pebble which she <b>found</b> on <b>herself</b> when she awoke, she goes on a journey of self-discovery.|$|R
5000|$|Sharon Blynn [...] is an American {{actress and}} cancer activist. She was noted for her {{activities}} for [...] "Bald is Beautiful" [...] , an organization <b>founded</b> by <b>herself</b> for ovarian cancer awareness programs, and her bald {{appearances in the}} public.|$|R
5|$|After {{a period}} of rest and recovery, Zita <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> {{regularly}} going back to Europe for the weddings of her children. She decided {{to move back to}} the continent full-time, in 1952, to Luxembourg, in order to look after her aging mother. Maria Antonia {{died at the age of}} 96 in 1959. The bishop of Chur proposed to Zita that she move into a residence that he administered (formerly a castle of the Counts de Salis) at Zizers, Graubünden in Switzerland. As the castle had enough space for visits from her large family and a nearby chapel (a necessity for the devoutly Catholic Zita), she accepted with ease.|$|E
5|$|Born on 14 March 1822 in Naples, TeresaCristina {{became an}} orphan {{when her father}} died in 1830. Her mother {{is said to have}} {{neglected}} her after marrying a young officer in 1839. Historiography has long asserted that she was raised in lonely isolation, in an environment of religious superstition, intolerance and conservatism. It has also described Teresa Cristina as a soft and timid character, unlike her ruthless father or her impulsive mother. She has even been depicted as unassertive, and accustomed to be satisfied in whatever circumstances she <b>found</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E
5|$|Born to Cheryl and Doug McLeod in St. Albert, Alberta, a city near Edmonton, Erin {{was raised}} with her younger sister, Cara, and older sister, Megan. As a young girl, McLeod {{fell in love}} with hockey and the Edmonton Oilers. At the age of five, her family moved to Calgary, where she {{channelled}} her obsession into soccer. She quickly climbed the local soccer ranks and <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> a midfielder on a Calgary select team. At the age of 12, the goalkeeper on the team was injured and she stepped up for the spot. She has been a goalkeeper ever since.|$|E
50|$|Von Sabinin {{worked at}} a {{hospital}} from 1876 to 1878 during the Russo-Turkish War and afterward entered a nunnery of the Tsarist Sisters of the Annunciation. She became an abbess, <b>founded</b> hospitals <b>herself,</b> and died in 1892 in the Crimea.|$|R
60|$|All laughed heartily at this poem, which perhaps {{diverted}} {{them more}} than a better would have done; Harriet was highly delighted with what she considered their applause, though she knew {{that of all the}} rhymes, scarcely three had been <b>found</b> by <b>herself.</b>|$|R

5|$|Cordova-Buckley, {{who began}} {{appearing}} on the show during the third season, {{was surprised to find}} the writers' characterization of Rodriguez in the episode to closely mirror her own life. Cordova-Buckley stated that, like how Rodriguez is seen in the episode, she dislikes nightclubs, and has <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> changing over time to be a different person from who her old friends remember; for Cordova-Buckley, this was seen in returning to Mexico after becoming an actor in the United States, which is reflected with Rodriguez's friends from Colombia from before she worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. as an Inhuman asset.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor {{was also}} active {{on the home}} front. Beginning in 1941, she co-chaired the Office of Civilian Defense (OCD) with New York City Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, working to give {{civilian}} volunteers expanded roles in war preparations. She soon <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> in a power struggle with LaGuardia, who preferred to focus on narrower aspects of defense, while she saw solutions to broader social problems as equally important to the war effort. Though LaGuardia resigned from the OCD in December 1941, Eleanor {{was forced to resign}} following anger in the House of Representatives over high salaries for several OCD appointments, including two of her close friends.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, OMM {{published}} an article about Allen's success through MySpace, and she received her first major mainstream coverage appearing in the magazine's cover story two months later. The popularity of her songs convinced her label to allow her more creative control over the album and {{to use some of}} the songs that she had written instead of attempting to work with mainstream producers. Allen <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> distracted by the publicity, so to focus on finishing the album, she travelled to the United States to work with producers Greg Kurstin and Mark Ronson. There, she was able to complete {{the second half of the}} album in approximately two weeks.|$|E
5000|$|A lovely {{young woman}} named Wanda <b>founds</b> <b>herself</b> penniless after leaving a hospital. She decides to visit a man she {{recently}} met in a café (who, she mistakenly hopes, would instantly recognize her) to ask for money. The man, who proves to be a dentist, asks her to take her place {{in a chair and}} starts examining the state of her teeth. Disheartened by the lack of recognition on his behalf, as well as her own unprepossessing appearance in the mirror, she, rather than asking for money, agrees to have her bad tooth pulled out and pays her last ruble for this. Happily, next day she meets another fine gentleman in the same café, a rich merchant from Kazan, and gets her financial position reasonably improved.|$|R

5|$|In addition, Laurent won {{a number}} of accolades for her {{portrayal}} of Shosana including Austin Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress and Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Actress, and nominations at the Detroit Film Critics Society Awards, Empire Award for Best Actress, and Saturn Award for Best Actress among others. The highly anticipated film, which had been in development since 1998, marked Laurent's first major role in an American film and Laurent <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> pushed into mainstream success in North America.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1840s, Mary Shelley <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> {{the target}} of three {{separate}} blackmailers. In 1845, an Italian political exile called Gatteschi, whom she had met in Paris, threatened to publish letters she had sent him. A friend of her son's bribed a police chief into seizing Gatteschi's papers, including the letters, which were then destroyed. Shortly afterwards, Mary Shelley bought some letters written by herself and Percy Bysshe Shelley from a man calling himself G. Byron and posing as the illegitimate son of the late Lord Byron. Also in 1845, Percy Bysshe Shelley's cousin Thomas Medwin approached her claiming to have written a damaging biography of Percy Shelley. He said he would suppress it in return for £250, but Mary Shelley refused.|$|E
5|$|Knox began forcing Kelly to {{accompany}} him to ringside so he could {{keep an eye on}} her, making her his de facto valet. As a result, she <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> involved in the feud developing between Mike Knox and partner Test with Tommy Dreamer and his partner The Sandman, including being inadvertently hit with a cane by Sandman when Knox used her as a shield. She made her in-ring debut for the brand on the August 22, 2006 episode of ECW on Sci-Fi in a losing effort, as part of a six-person mixed tag team match which saw herself, Knox, and Test lose to Dreamer, Sandman and Torrie Wilson, in what was the last match of the feud.|$|E

50|$|Chin's {{music has}} been {{highlighted}} at major music festivals such as at the 2014 Lucerne Festival, the Festival Musica in Strasbourg, the Suntory Summer Festival, the 2013 Stockholm Concert Hall's Tonsätterfestival or Settembre Musica in Italy.

5|$|On June 14, 1832, Cadron-Jetté's husband Jean-Marie died of cholera, one of {{many victims}} of that year's cholera epidemic, leaving Cadron-Jetté widowed. Cadron-Jetté responded to her husband's death by vowing to be in mourning, or wear black, for the {{remainder}} of her life. At that time, Cadron-Jetté's eldest two sons, Jean-Marie and Pierre (20 and 17 years old, respectively), were employed as shoemakers, and the eldest daughter, Rose (19) was engaged (and was married in July 1833), while Cadron-Jetté's other four surviving children still required Cadron-Jetté's care, as did Cadron-Jetté's elderly mother. It was not until 1838, following the death of Cadron-Jetté's mother and the maturity or death of her remaining children, that she <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> with time free to devote to charitable activities.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Princess <b>found</b> <b>herself,</b> in 1702, in {{the middle}} of a protocolary spat between Tuscany and Spain.

Philip V initially deigned only to sanction his aunt Violante Beatrice's use; however, the agent, Pucci, eventually requisitioned full recognition.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth season}} began as Zolciak {{was in the}} middle of her first {{pregnancy}} by her boyfriend Biermann; she later gave birth to their son. Leakes continued divorce proceedings with Gregg, while Whitfield <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> in financial difficulties after her ex-husband failed to pay child support. Meanwhile, Bailey opened her own modeling agency, while Parks looked to launch a family-operated funeral home. Leakes's new friendship with Hampton caused tension between all of the women, which escalated during a group vacation in South Africa; while Zolciak, who had remained home with her children, became upset by negative comments Bailey (not Burruss) made about her during the group vacation. As the season closed, Leakes began to reconsider her divorce from Gregg.|$|E
