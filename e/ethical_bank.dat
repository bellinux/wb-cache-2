Of course, consumers do not purchase and invest for solely economic reasons (Polanyi, 1944). Interest in ethics in economics {{has been the subject of}} continuous study. In this regard, the recent financial crisis has had not only economic, but also social, psychological, political, and ethical consequences, which have impacted the financial and banking system.

One way of raising the industry wide regulations would be for citizens to apply pressure on banks. Without this rise it is difficult to impede unethical businesses from finding a bank to finance their projects. A rise in regulations that deal with moral topics is not out of the question. The current industry wide codes, for example, prohibit the financing of illegal drug production. This reflects the prominent societal morals against such drugs.|$|R

5000|$|For Aristotle, {{lawfulness}} {{is important}} in the measurement of morality, as is equality and justice. Whether an action is or is not in accordance with the law is an important measurement of morality for Aristotle. Many banks do business in accordance with the law in all practices. They may also specifically seek to do business with law-abiding clients. Nevertheless, this can be problematic, as laws vary internationally. This means that a bank could be viewed as ethical even while funding clients who lawfully conduct business in harmful manners. However this measurement is challenged by Aristotle's statement: [...] "what is just in transactions is something equitable, and what is unjust is something inequitable" [...] (p. 84). This means that a bank needs {{to take into account the}} unjust/inequitable behavior of its borrowers to qualify as an <b>ethical</b> <b>bank.</b> For example, lending to a law-abiding corporation that does not pay its employees a sufficient living wage would be immoral.|$|E
5000|$|In general banks play an {{intermediary}} {{role in the}} economy; because of this the possibility for banks to contribute to sustainable development is extensive.

Banks are experienced and capable of weighing risks and attaching a price to these risks; because of this banks can fulfill {{an important role in}} reducing the information asymmetry between market parties and allow them to make better decisions. When depositors allow a bank to invest for them they may assume that the bank will attempt to select investments to maximize their returns. However, if clients are concerned with more than the simple monetary return and they, for instance, are interested in the costs to society and to the environment, then they may need to turn to an <b>ethical</b> <b>bank</b> which takes their ethics and morality into account when investing.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} analyze the {{principal}} differences between ethical banking {{and the rest of}} funding organizations—banks, saving entities, credit cooperatives. With this aim, the paper first defines the essential characteristics of ethical banking—maximum social participation, efficient and professional management, transparency as a fundamental value, the existence of an ethical code, the inversion of assets in projects with an abiding social value and global measure. Furthermore, with the aim of providing the contrast among the funding organizations, the paper proposes an index, `Radical Affinity Index', which is focused essentially on the responsibility of lenders with regard to the decisions on the final use of funds. Once obtained, the index makes it possible to compare the classification of banking groups metrically. Therefore, the paper used a part of the index—transparency—as the first differential factor of ethical banking, to evaluate the hypothesis—there are significant differences in informative transparency between ethical banking and traditional banking. Ethical banking is a topical subject. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Muhammad Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank, the greatest exponent of the ethical banking concept, has taken this topic to the front page. However, we have to emphasize that, on the one hand, at the European level, there exist entities such as Triodos Bank (Holland), Oekobank (Germany) or ABS (Switzerland) from the 1980 s (Ballesteros, 2003), and on the other hand, at the state level, during this same period, the first attempt at creating an alternative banking, the Ethical and Ecological Banking Association (ABSE), was not successful for different reasons and has to be abandoned. After an important gap which lasted for more than ten years, with the dawn of the new century, the interest in developing ethical banking in Spain has reemerged with great strength. Among the different initiatives, we can mention the creation of the Financial Tool Web (RUFAS), the Economic Solidarity Foundation (REAS Euskalherria), the Association for the Ethical and Social Support Banking, FETS (Financament Ëtic i Solidari) the Trust project and the FIARE.

40|$|Marian Sawer More than 1, 100 workers died in April {{when the}} Rana Plaza {{building}} housing garment factories collapsed in Bangladesh. Online activists on Change. org {{have since been}} calling for consumer action to pressure retailers such as Big W, Woolworths and Kmart to sign up to an international agreement to improve fire and building safety in their factories in Bangladesh. In recent decades {{an increasing number of}} Australians have taken their political and ethical values with them to the supermarket, particularly values relating to the environment and the treatment of animals (think free-range eggs). More controversial have been the BDI (boycott, divestment and sanctions) campaigns directed against Israeli companies such as Max Brenner Chocolate, This kind of consumer action is not new. In the late eighteenth century and again {{in the early nineteenth century}} very successful boycotts of slave-grown sugar were organised in the United Kingdom. In the 1820 s British Quaker Elizabeth Heyrick inspired women to distribute leaflets door-to-door urging householders not to buy West Indian (‘blood-stained’) sugar. Women have proved to have a particular affinity with this form of political participation, whether the boycott of Nestlé over its marketing of infant formula (replacing breastfeeding) in developing countries or the pressuring of advertisers to withdraw from Alan Jones’ 2 UE radio program over his misogynist behaviour towards the Prime Minister. The existence of the Internet and social media networks has helped promote political consumerism and by 2005 general surveys such as the Australian Survey of Social Attitudes were finding that political consumerism had been engaged in by over a third of Australians in the preceding year, the most popular form of political participation apart from signing petitions. Political science, however, was slow to investigate this form of political participation. The fact that political consumerism was identified with women and the ‘politics of everyday life’ made it less likely to be taken seriously than male-identified activities such as participating in a demonstration. A further justification for neglect was that it targeted businesses and only targeted the state indirectly The first international survey of political consumerism was reported on in the International Political Science Review in 2005. The article, ‘Politics in the Supermarket: Political Consumerism as a Form of Political Participation’ has just become available on Open Access. The authors are Dietlind Stolle, Marc Hooghe and Michele Micheletti, who surveyed undergraduate social science students in Belgium, Canada and Sweden. The findings confirm the increased significance of political consumerism as a form of political participation – 72 per cent of those surveyed had chosen products based on ethical consideration over the past year (‘buycotted’), while 63 per cent had boycotted a product. The survey also confirmed the gender gap in preference for this form of political participation, despite male and female students reporting the same frequency of shopping. The findings provide fascinating insight into cross-national differences in political consumerism and this has become the most highly cited article in International Political Science Review in the past decade. While a majority of participants in all three countries engaged in political consumerism when grocery shopping, it was Swedes who were much more likely to apply ethical considerations to buying soap or detergents. There are high-profile eco-labeling systems in Sweden. Perhaps the equivalent in Australia is choosing Earth Choice products or joining the boycott of products containing palm oil due to the destruction of orangutan habitat by palmoil plantations. Canadians, by contrast, were more likely to apply political consumerism to the purchase of clothing, something attributed to ‘no sweat’ campaigns, which have a long history in North America. Already in the early 1900 s Florence Kelley of the US National Consumers’ League was using a White Label system for employers that did not use sweated labour. The Belgians had yet another focus, being more likely than Swedes or Canadians to apply ethical considerations to banking choices, perhaps because of the visibility of a Dutch-based <b>ethical</b> <b>bank</b> in Belgium. They were however generally less engaged in political consumerism than their Canadian and Swedish counterparts. Detailed Australian evidence about political consumerism is only just emerging from the as yet unpublished 2013 Civic Network survey conducted for Ariadne Vromen, Michael Xenos and Brian Loader. It differs from the Stolle et al. survey because although it is also covers three countries it is based on a representative sample of young people (1418 in Australia) rather than on university students. Among the Australian findings are that, in the year prior to the survey, 36 per cent had boycotted and 34 per cent had buycotted products. In Australia political consumerism tends to be more oriented to animal rights and environmentalism and has a narrower fair trade’ focus (mainly tea, coffee and chocolate) than found in Europe. Political consumerism has become an increasingly significant form of political engagement and not only for young people. It is one of the forms of political participation that is continuing to increase, like signing petitions and other online activism and unlike party membership. Political science is catching up with it and developing new understandings of political participation to match the new forms of engagement.
