5|$|A classic {{error is}} {{the attempt to}} use the equals {{operator}} = {{in combination with the}} keyword NULL to find rows with Nulls. According to the SQL standard this is an invalid syntax and shall lead to an error message or an exception. But most implementations accept the syntax and evaluate such expressions to UNKNOWN. The consequence is that no rows are found - regardless of whether rows with Nulls exist or not. The proposed way to retrieve rows with Nulls <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of the predicate IS NULL instead of = NULL.|$|E

5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for digital signal processing. DSP <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of digital means to process signals, and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers {{is the ability}} to tailor the bandwidth of the receiver to current reception conditions and to the type of signal being listened to. A typical analog-only receiver may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, or only one, but a DSP receiver may have 40 or more individually selectable filters.|$|E
5|$|A variant on {{this design}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of arrays, whose tilt angle can be {{adjusted}} twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output. They also require more land area to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle. Because the increased output is typically only a few percent, it seldom justifies the increased cost and complexity of this design.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{economic}} theory behind congestion pricing, {{the objective of this}} policy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.|$|E

5|$|Apple {{trees are}} {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} fungal and bacterial diseases and insect pests. Many commercial orchards pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields.

Organic methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.|$|E

As well as executing well-timed manoeuvres and jumps, the player is able to use starship props to block or defend themselves. Another feature <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of remote controlled drones, which can be directed by Alien 8 into inaccessible or dangerous areas.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} size, shape, and {{well-defined}} chemical structures, viruses {{have been used}} as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify signals in DNA microarray based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers. Another example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of CPMV as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium-selective sensors {{based on}} the {{fluorophore}} BODIPY {{have been developed for}} imaging and sensing of cadmium in cells.

Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy fishing {{pressure}} {{within its}} range, the cloudy catshark remains common, {{perhaps because it}} may be more biologically productive than most other sharks.

Maggot debridement therapy (MDT) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of blow fly larvae to remove the dead tissue from wounds, most commonly being amputations. Historically, this has been used for centuries, both intentional and unintentional, on battlefields and in early hospital settings. Removing the dead tissue promotes cell growth and healthy wound healing. The larvae also have biochemical properties such as antibacterial activity found in their secretions as they feed. These medicinal maggots are a safe and effective treatment for chronic wounds.|$|E

In response to acts of food power, a nation usually acts in the interest of its citizens to provide food.|$|E
