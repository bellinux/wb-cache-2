40|$|Size of the vomeronasal type 1 {{receptor}} (<b>V</b> 1 R) <b>gene</b> repertoire {{may be a}} good indicator {{for examining}} the relationship between animal genomes and their environmental niche specialization, especially the relationship between ecological factors and the molecular evolutionary history of the sensory system. Recently, Young et al. (Young JM, Massa HF, Hsu L, Trask BJ. 2009. Extreme variability among mammalian <b>V</b> 1 R <b>gene</b> families. Genome Res.) concluded that no single ecological factor could explain the extreme variability of the <b>V</b> 1 R <b>gene</b> repertoire in mammalian genomes. In contrast, we found a significant positive correlation between the size and percentage of <b>intact</b> <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> in 32 species that represent the phylogenetic diversity of terricolous mammals and two ecological factors: spatial activity and rhythm activity. Nest-living species possessed a greater number of <b>intact</b> <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> than open-living species, and nocturnal terricolous mammals tended to possess more <b>intact</b> <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> than did diurnal species. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the evolutionary mechanisms underlying these observations likely resulted from the rapid gene birth and accelerated amino acid substitutions in nest-living and nocturnal mammals, likely a functional requirement for exploiting narrow, dark environments. Taken together, these results reveal how adaptation to divergent circadian rhythms and spatial activity were manifested at the genomic scale. Size of the <b>V</b> 1 R <b>gene</b> family might have indicated how this gene family adapts to ecological factors...|$|R
40|$|Pheromones are {{chemicals}} emitted and sensed by conspecifics {{to elicit}} social and sexual responses and are perceived in terrestrial vertebrates {{primarily by the}} vomeronasal organ (VNO). Pheromone receptors in the mammalian VNO are encoded by the V 1 R and <b>V</b> 2 R <b>gene</b> superfamilies. The <b>V</b> 1 R superfamily contains 187 and 102 putatively functional genes in the mouse and rat, respectively. To investigate whether this large repertoire size is typical among mammals with functional VNOs, we here describe the V 1 R repertoires of dog, cow, and opossum based on their draft genome sequences. The dog and cow have only 8 and 32 <b>intact</b> <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes,</b> respectively. Thus, the <b>intact</b> <b>V</b> 1 R repertoire size varies by at least 23 -fold among placental mammals with functional VNOs. To our knowledge, this size ratio represents the greatest among-species variation in gene family size of all mammalian gene families. Phylogenetic analysis of placental <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> suggests multiple losses of ancestral genes in carnivores and artiodactyls and gains of many new genes by gene duplication in rodents, manifesting massive gene births and deaths. We also identify 49 <b>intact</b> opossum <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> and discover independent expansions of the repertoire in placentals and marsupials. We further show a concordance between the V 1 R repertoire size and the complexity of VNO morphology, suggesting that the latter could indicate the sophistication of pheromone communications within species. In sum, our results demonstrate tremendous diversity and rapid evolution of mammalian <b>V</b> 1 R <b>gene</b> inventories and caution the generalization of VNO biology from rodents to all mammals...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the changes}} that occur in Ig <b>V</b> region <b>genes</b> during a B lymphocyte’s {{response}} to antigen usually result from point mutations, nucleotide insertion and deletion also alter gene sequence. We identified nucleotide insertions and deletions (3 to 12 bp) at a frequency of 1. 34 %, in Ig <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> cDNA from B lymphocytes residing in the synovial tissues of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Because the added or lost nucleotides occurred in multiples of 3, they maintained the original reading frame and coded a potentially <b>intact</b> receptor. These <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> modifications were generated somatically, because they were identified in the original cDNA by HCDR 3 -specific polymerase chain reaction and were not found in other B cells using the same VH genes. Insertions and deletions were detected only in IgG+ and IgA+ transcripts, which exhibited 3 times more point mutations than IgM+ transcripts. In addition, they were usually found in the complementarity determining region, typical targets of somatic mutation. The occurrence of insertion/deletion in isotype-switched cDNA with higher numbers of <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> mutations that localized to hot spots for <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> mutation suggests that these diversification events {{were related to the}} somatic hypermutation process. In support of this, an AGY hot spot motif and a short stretch of DNA similar in sequence to the inserted or deleted segments could be found next to the insertions/deletions, suggesting that these modifications arose from DNA duplication following DNA stand breaks. Thus, nucleotide insertion/deletion can lead to B-cell receptor diversification in B lymphocytes that clonally expand in synovial tissues of patients with rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of chemosensory stimuli by the sensory neurons {{of the mouse}} vomeronasal organ (VNO) is mainly mediated by seven-transmembrane receptors that are encoded by two large <b>gene</b> repertoires, <b>V</b> 1 R and V 2 R. The mouse genome contains 122 <b>intact</b> <b>V</b> 2 R <b>genes,</b> which can be grouped in four families by sequence homology: families A, B, and D (115 genes), and family C (7 genes). Vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) in the basal layer of the VNO epithelium coexpress two <b>V</b> 2 R <b>genes</b> in non-random combinations: one family-ABD <b>V</b> 2 R <b>gene</b> together with one family-C <b>V</b> 2 R <b>gene,</b> such as Vmn 2 r 1 (29 % of basal VSNs) or Vmn 2 r 2 (52 %). This coordinated coexpression {{may contribute to the}} highly specialized sensory response profiles of VSNs, for instance by heterodimerization of a family-ABD with a family-C V 2 R. The mechanisms that regulate this coordinated cooexpression of two <b>V</b> 2 R <b>genes</b> per basal VSN are not understood. Among possible models are a sequential and dependent model of expression; a model of random combinations of expression followed by cellular selection of VSNs with appropriate combinations; and a model of direct coordination of gene expression by another gene family such as genes encoding transcription factors. Here, we describe two novel mouse strains with targeted mutations in the family-ABD <b>V</b> 2 R <b>gene</b> <b>V</b> 2 rf 2 that begin to provide insight into this problem. We observe that the great majority of VSNs that express <b>intact</b> <b>V</b> 2 rf 2 coexpress Vmn 2 r 1 immunoreactivity, and that the percentage of Vmn 2 r 1 coexpression increases from 3 to 10 wk. Having established this tight coexpression of V 2 rf 2 with Vmn 2 r 1, we then asked if it is maintained when the coding sequence of V 2 rf 2 is deleted. We find that the number of VSNs expressing a locus with a targeted deletion in the coding sequence of V 2 rf 2 that is likely a null mutation, is similar to the number of VSNs that express <b>intact</b> <b>V</b> 2 rf 2. But 25 % of these VSNs coexpress another family-ABD V 2 R, which is consistent with the absence of negative feedback from the mutated V 2 rf 2 locus. Interestingly, 9. 5 % of VSNs expressing the targeted deletion of V 2 rf 2 now coexpress Vmn 2 r 2. Finally, the marginal region of the VNO epithelium, where immature VSNs are concentrated, has more RNA of family-ABD <b>V</b> 2 R <b>genes</b> than of family-C genes in postnatal wild-type mice. Our results are most consistent with the sequential and dependent model for the coordinated coexpression of two <b>V</b> 2 R <b>genes</b> per basal VSN...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{applied a}} {{comprehensive}} data-mining strategy {{to examine the}} repertoires of rat and mouse odorant receptors (ORs) and type 1 pheromone receptors (V 1 Rs) using the mm 5 (mouse) and rn 3 (rat) genomes. We identified 1576 rat OR genes, including 292 pseudogenes. The rat V 1 R repertoire is composed of 115 intact genes and 72 pseudogenes. The mouse OR and V 1 R databases were updated using the new assembly mm 5, from which 1375 mouse ORs and 308 V 1 Rs were identified, with more than 100 putative pseudogenes from mm 2 now identified as intact because of the higher sequence quality. With these new data we have {{conducted a series of}} genomic analyses of the OR and <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> from mouse and rat. Orthologous OR clusters were identified in mouse and rat and comparison analysis was performed at three incremental levels: families, coding sequences, and motifs. At the family level, we found that <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> have more species-specific families than OR genes. About 20 % of <b>intact</b> <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> have no orthologous counterpart in the same family, whereas less than 1 % of intact ORs are similarly isolated. At the coding sequence level, OR genes are more conserved between mouse and rat than <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes.</b> OR genes share greater similarity with their orthologous counterparts than with their closest neighbor, whereas <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> show the opposite tendency. Motifs were identified to obtain biological insights.

40|$|Abstract Background In teleost fishes {{that lack}} a vomeronasal organ, both main odorant receptors (ORs) and vomeronasal receptors family 2 (V 2 Rs) are {{expressed}} in the olfactory epithelium, and used for perception of water-soluble chemicals. In zebrafish, {{it is known that}} both ORs and V 2 Rs formed multigene families of about a hundred copies. Whereas the contribution of V 2 Rs in zebrafish to olfaction {{has been found to be}} substantially large, the composition and structure of the <b>V</b> 2 R <b>gene</b> family in other fishes are poorly known, compared with the OR gene family. Results To understand the evolutionary dynamics of <b>V</b> 2 R <b>genes</b> in fishes, <b>V</b> 2 R sequences in zebrafish, medaka, fugu, and spotted green pufferfish were identified from their draft genome sequences. There were remarkable differences in the number of <b>intact</b> <b>V</b> 2 R <b>genes</b> in different species. Most <b>V</b> 2 R <b>genes</b> in these fishes were tightly clustered in one or two specific chromosomal regions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the fish V 2 R family could be subdivided into 16 subfamilies that had diverged before the separation of the four fishes. Genes in two subfamilies in zebrafish and another subfamily in medaka increased in their number independently, suggesting species-specific evolution in olfaction. Interestingly, the arrangements of <b>V</b> 2 R <b>genes</b> in the gene clusters were highly conserved among species in the subfamily level. A genomic region of tetrapods corresponding to the region in fishes that contains the V 2 R cluster was found to have no <b>V</b> 2 R <b>gene</b> in any species. Conclusion Our results have indicated that the evolutionary dynamics of fish V 2 Rs are characterized by rapid gene turnover and lineage-specific phylogenetic clustering. In addition, the present phylogenetic and comparative genome analyses have shown that the fish V 2 Rs have expanded after the divergence between teleost and tetrapod lineages. The present identification of the entire V 2 R repertoire in fishes would provide useful foundation to the future functional and evolutionary studies of fish <b>V</b> 2 R <b>gene</b> family. </p...|$|R
40|$|Two {{evolutionarily}} unrelated superfamilies of G-protein coupled receptors, V 1 Rs and V 2 Rs, bind pheromones and “ordinary” odorants {{to initiate}} vomeronasal chemical senses in vertebrates, which play {{important roles in}} many aspects of an organism’s daily life such as mating, territoriality, and foraging. To study the macroevolution of vomeronasal sensitivity, we identified all V 1 R and <b>V</b> 2 R <b>genes</b> from the genome sequences of 11 vertebrates. Our analysis suggests the presence of multiple V 1 R and <b>V</b> 2 R <b>genes</b> in the common ancestor of teleost fish and tetrapods and reveals an exceptionally large among-species variation in the sizes of these gene repertoires. Interestingly, {{the ratio of the}} number of <b>intact</b> <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> to that of <b>V</b> 2 R <b>genes</b> increased by ∼ 50 -fold as land vertebrates evolved from aquatic vertebrates. A similar increase was found for the ratio of the number of class II odorant receptor (OR) genes to that of class I genes, but not in other vertebrate <b>gene</b> families. Because <b>V</b> 1 Rs and class II ORs have been suggested to bind to small airborne chemicals, whereas V 2 Rs and class I ORs recognize water-soluble molecules, these increases reflect a rare case of adaptation to terrestrial life at the gene family level. Several gene families known to function in concert with V 2 Rs in the mouse are absent outside rodents, indicating rapid changes of interactions between vomeronasal receptors and their molecular partners. Taken together, our results demonstrate the exceptional evolutionary fluidity of vomeronasal receptors, making them excellent targets for studying the molecular basis of physiological and behavioral diversity and adaptation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In mammals, pheromones play an {{important}} role in social and innate reproductive behavior within species. In rodents, vomeronasal receptor type 1 (V 1 R), which is specifically expressed in the vomeronasal organ, is thought to detect pheromones. The <b>V</b> 1 R <b>gene</b> repertoire differs dramatically between mammalian species, and the presence of species-specific V 1 R subfamilies in mouse and rat suggests that V 1 R plays a profound role in species-specific recognition of pheromones. In ruminants, however, the molecular mechanism(s) for pheromone perception is not well understood. Interestingly, goat male pheromone, which can induce out-of-season ovulation in anestrous females, causes the same pheromone response in sheep, and vice versa, suggesting that there may be mechanisms for detecting "inter-species" pheromones among ruminant species. Results We isolated 23 goat and 21 sheep <b>intact</b> <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> based on sequence similarity with 32 cow <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> in the cow genome database. We found that all of the goat and sheep <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> have orthologs in their cross-species counterparts among these three ruminant species and that the sequence identity of V 1 R orthologous pairs among these ruminants is much higher than that of mouse-rat V 1 R orthologous pairs. Furthermore, all goat V 1 Rs examined thus far are expressed not only in the vomeronasal organ but also in the main olfactory epithelium. Conclusion Our results suggest that, compared with rodents, the repertoire of orthologous <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> is remarkably conserved among the ruminants cow, sheep and goat. We predict that these orthologous V 1 Rs can detect the same or closely related chemical compound(s) within each orthologous set/pair. Furthermore, all identified goat V 1 Rs are expressed in the vomeronasal organ and the main olfactory epithelium, suggesting that V 1 R-mediated ligand information can be detected and processed by both the main and accessory olfactory systems. The fact that ruminant and rodent V 1 Rs have distinct features suggests that ruminant and rodent V 1 Rs have evolved distinct functions. </p...|$|R
40|$|The <b>V</b> 1 R <b>gene</b> family {{comprises}} one of {{two types}} of putative pheromone receptors expressed in the mammalian vomeronasal organ (VNO). We searched the most recent mouse, rat, dog, chimpanzee, and human genome sequence assemblies to compile a near-complete repertoire of <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> for each species. Dog, human, and chimpanzee have very few <b>intact</b> <b>V</b> 1 Rs (8, 2, and 0, respectively) compared {{to more than a}} hundred <b>intact</b> <b>V</b> 1 Rs in each of the rat (106) and mouse (165) genomes. We also provide the first description of the diversity of V 1 R pseudogenes in these species. We identify at least 165 pseudogenes in mouse, 110 in rat, 102 in chimpanzee, 115 in human, and 54 in dog. Primate and dog pseudogenes are distributed among almost all V 1 R subfamilies seen in rodents, indicating that the common ancestor of these species had a diverse V 1 R repertoire. We find that <b>V</b> 1 R <b>genes</b> were subject to strikingly different fates in different species and in different subfamilies. In rodents, some subfamilies remained relatively stable or underwent roughly equivalent expansion in mouse and rat; other subfamilies expanded in one species but not the other. The small number of <b>intact</b> <b>V</b> 1 Rs in the dog genome is unexpected given the presumption that dogs, like rodents, have a functional VNO, and a complex system of pheromone-based behaviors. We identify an intact transient receptor potential channel 2 β in the dog genome, consistent with a functional VNO in dogs. The diminished V 1 R repertoire in dogs raises questions about the relative contributions of V 1 Rs versus other candidate pheromone receptor genes in the establishment of complex pheromone systems in mammals...|$|R

40|$|Many genes {{involved}} in the transport of iron by bacteria {{as well as in}} pathogenesis are regulated by the environmental concentration of iron, with increased expression under low-iron conditions. In Escherichia coli, transcriptional regulation by iron depends on the fur gene. A virulence gene in Vibrio cholerae (irgA) is also transcriptionally regulated by iron, and the promoter of irgA contains a dyad repeat homologous to Fur binding sites in E. coli. Southern hybridization of V. cholerae chromosomal DNA, using an internal fragment of E. coli fur as a probe, showed a single hybridizing sequence under conditions of low stringency. We derived a restriction map in the vicinity of this hybridizing sequence; overlapping PstI and HindIII fragments were identified {{at the center of this}} map. The cloned PstI fragment failed to complement an E. coli fur mutant; sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame that began just downstream of the PstI site, suggesting that the clone was not functional because it lacked its promoter. The overlapping HindIII fragment contained the <b>intact</b> <b>V.</b> cholerae fur <b>gene</b> with its promoter and complemented an E. coli fur mutant. DNA sequencing of the HindIII fragment demonstrated a single open reading frame of 150 amino acids that was 76 % homologous to E. coli Fur.

Northern blot analysis showed that the two fur transcripts were not strongly regulated by iron.

40|$|The {{genesis of}} human {{follicular}} lymphoma (FL) is a multistep process.

However, FL is recognized clinically as a tumor of surface Ig (sIg) -positive B cells with morphologic and phenotypic similarities to the centrocyte of the secondary immune response. Thus, additional steps must be involved in the clonal expansion of the FL tumor cell beyond the activation of bcl- 2 {{as a consequence of the}} t(14; 18) translocation. Like the normal centrocyte, somatic mutations accumulate in the variable (<b>V)</b> <b>genes</b> of FL tumor B cells. To determine if clonal expansion of FL occurs before or after the development of the malignant follicle, we sought to examine the evolution of the FL <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> from its unmutated germline (GL) counterpart. To obtain the GL gene we first cloned the productively rearranged <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> of patient MT FL and obtained the clone rMTF.

This probe was used to screen a size-selected library, and candidate GL <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> were isolated. Two identical clones, MTGL 1 and 2, proved to have upstream regions (USRs) that were colinear with the USR of the rMTF. Thus, the MTGL clones represent the unmutated GL <b>V</b> <b>genes,</b> which were productively rearranged in the MT FL. Comparison of the GL <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> sequence to a consensus of MT FL <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> sequences revealed 42 mutations, demonstrating that malignant clonal expansion occurred subsequent to the activation of somatic mutation, presumably in the malignant follicle. Furthermore, the individual FL <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> sequences segregated into two distinct patterns of mutation. The major population represented 71 % of the clones, and the minor population 29 %. To investigate possible mechanisms for the parallel selection of distinct tumor cell populations, we analyzed the pattern of silent and replacement mutations within the <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> sequences. We found that in the framework regions (FRs) of both populations there were significantly fewer replacement changes than expected, suggesting that negative selective pressure was maintaining the structural integrity of the sIg. In contrast, the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which make up the antigen binding domain of Ig, had an excess of replacement changes, suggesting positive selection for altered ligand binding...|$|R
40|$|Evidence for somatic {{hypermutation}} of immunoglobulin genes {{has been observed}} in all the species in which immunoglobulins have been found. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} codon usage in Ig <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> is such that the sequence-specificity of {{somatic hypermutation}} results in greater mutability in complementarity-determining regions of the gene than in the framework regions. We have developed a new resampling-based methodology to explore genetic plasticity in individual <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> and in <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> families in a statistically meaningful way. We determine what factors contribute to this mutability difference, and characterize the strength of selection for this effect. We nd that although the codon usage in Ig <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> renders them distinct among translationally equivalent sequences with random codon usage, they are nevertheless far from being optimal in this regard. We find that the mutability patterns in a number of species are similar to those we find for human sequences. Interestingly, sheep seque [...] ...|$|R

Recognition of antigen depends on immunoglobulin variable regions, encoded by <b>V</b> <b>genes.</b> We studied V(H) DJ(H) and V(L) J(L) gene use in monoclonal B cells by clonal analysis in 20 patients with polyneuropathy and IgM monoclonal gammopathy. <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> associated with bacterial responses appear over-represented and V(H) 3 - 23 was preferentially used, without association with specific D, J(H) or V(L) J(L). <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> revealed somatic mutation and intraclonal variation {{was found in}} 9 of 20 patients.

40|$|T cell {{receptor}} <b>V</b> gamma <b>genes</b> rearrange to the J gamma 1 gene segment {{in a highly}} ordered fashion during development. We demonstrate a striking correlation between the pattern of expression of unrearranged <b>V</b> gamma <b>genes</b> and the timing of their rearrangement. Thus, the increases in V gamma 2 rearrangements, and decreases in V gamma 3 and V gamma 4 rearrangements observed during development are paralleled by increasing or decreasing levels of the corresponding unrearranged <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> transcript. We also provide evidence that both the V gamma 3 and <b>V</b> gamma 4 <b>genes</b> are accessible in mature V gamma 3 + cells, but that the <b>V</b> gamma 4 <b>gene</b> may be inaccessible in the progenitors of V gamma 3 cells. The results suggest that regulated local accessibility of the chromatin surrounding <b>V</b> gamma <b>genes</b> is responsible for ordered <b>V</b> gamma <b>gene</b> rearrangement during development...|$|R

40|$|Preferential use of {{particular}} <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> {{families in the}} response to specific antigens has been demonstrated in several systems. The lack of responses to certain types of antigens, therefore, could {{be the result of}} deletion of or failure to express some <b>V</b> <b>genes.</b> Because CBA/N mice, which carry the X-linked immunodeficiency (xid) gene defect, {{have been shown to be}} unresponsive to thymus-independent polysaccharide antigens, it was of interest to examine if this unresponsiveness could be accounted for by abnormal expression {{of particular}} <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> families. Using in situ hybridization on B cell colonies, we determined the expression of nine <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> families in CBA/CaHN females (genotypically normal), CBA/N males (xid) and females (xid), and (CBA/N x CBA/CaHN) F 1 males (xid) and females (phenotypically normal). Our results indicate that <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> family expression, including the S 107 family, in CBA/N males and Fl males, is similar to that of CBA/CaHN and Fi females with predominant expression of J 558, the largest gene family, in all individuals. Interestingly, CBA/N female mice, which carry two defective X chromosomes, as a group expressed significantly reduced levels of the J 558 gene family, and as individuals showed variation in which family was predominantly expressed. We conclude that the unresponsiveness of mice with the xid defect to polysaccharide antigens can not be attribute...|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} T cell {{receptor}} <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> expression by lymphocytes from rheumatoid synovial fluid and paired peripheral blood samples was compared using a {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) -based assay. Eight rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who had varying durations of disease (from 2 to 20 years) were studied. In all patients there was evidence of a different pattern of <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> expression between the two compartments. Significantly increased expression {{of at least one}} V alpha or <b>V</b> beta <b>gene</b> family by synovial fluid T cells was observed in all the patients studied. Three different V alpha (V alpha 10, 15 and 18) and three V beta (V beta 4, 5 and 13) families were commonly elevated. Sequencing of synovial V beta transcripts demonstrated that the basis of increased expression of selected <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> families in the synovial fluid was due to the presence of dominant clonotypes within those families, which constituted up to 53 % of the sequences isolated from one particular synovial <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> family. There were considerable differences in the NDJ sequences found in synovial and peripheral blood T cell receptor (TCR) transcripts of the same <b>V</b> beta <b>gene</b> family. These data suggest that the TCR repertoire in the two compartments differs, and that antigen-driven expansion of particular synovial T cell populations is a component of rheumatoid synovitis, and is present in all stages of the disease...|$|R

40|$|Determining the clonal {{origins of}} {{malignant}} B-cells {{will have an}} impact on disease understanding and management. In this regard, immunoglobulin variable (<b>V)</b> region <b>gene</b> analysis already is having a significant impact in delineating the tumor cell of origin. It can identify, among other features whether such a cell has undergone somatic mutation, which usually occurs within germinal centres. Remarkably, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the mutational status of <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> has allowed researchers to identify two subsets of disease, one originating from an unmutated B-cell with a markedly poorer disease outcome and the other from a mutated B-cell, which associates with long-term survival. The <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> status in CLL thus provides a robust indicator of disease outcome, which is beginning to shape clinical treatment.

40|$|Several autoantibody-associated {{variable}} region (<b>V)</b> <b>genes</b> are preferentially expressed {{during early}} ontogenic development, suggesting strongly {{that they are}} of developmental and physiological importance. As such, {{it is possible that}} polymorphisms in {{one or more of these}} genes may alter susceptibility to autoimmune disease. We have searched extensively for a probe related to a developmentally regulated <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> that has the power to differentiate among highly homologous <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> in human populations. Using such a probe (i. e., Humhv 3005 /P 1) related to both anti-DNA and anti-IgG autoantibodies, we studied restriction fragment length polymorphisms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus and found an apparent heavy-chain <b>V</b> (VH) <b>gene</b> deletion that was nearly restricted to the autoimmune patients. These data suggest that deletions of physiologically important VH genes may increase the risk of autoimmunity through indirect effects on the development and homeostasis of the B-cell repertoire...|$|R

40|$|Tumor-specific markers are {{important}} in identifying and tracking malignant cells. In this regard, functionally rearranged immunoglobulin variable (<b>V)</b> region <b>genes</b> in B-cell tumors fulfill and extend these criteria. <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> provide signature motifs in tumor cells and can delineate critical features of the clonal history of the cell of origin. They also define a tumor-specific antigen, which can be targeted for immunotherapy. Our {{focus has been on}} using novel DNA fusion vaccines to induce antitumor immunity. Here, we describe in detail the methods for identifying tumor-derived <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> at the nucleotide level in the malignant plasma cells of multiple myeloma. We further present the methodology for assembly of tumor <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> as single-chain variable region fragments (scFv), fused in frame with an immunopotentiating nontoxic bacterial sequence, Fragment C (FrC) of tetanus toxin. These scFv. FrC DNA vaccines provide protection in myeloma models and are currently in clinical trials. The vaccines are patient specific and can be rapidly assembled for clinical use...|$|R

Complementation tests with phage bearing either <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> amber mutations or a precisely deleted <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> were used to test the extent of possible tail tube peptide display. Expression of plasmid-encoded gpV fused C-terminally with certain foreign peptides allowed rescue of such V gene-defective phage to essentially wild-type levels. After extensive purification such phage were shown by sensitive Western blotting to contain only the modified form of gpV. Peptide-modified gpV could also form indefinite tail tube polymeric structures (polytubes) ...|$|R
40|$|Following {{productive}} <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> rearrangement, {{the functional}} immunoglobulin {{genes in the}} B lymphocytes of man and mouse are subjected to two further types of genetic modification. Class-switch recombination, a region-specific but largely nonhomologous recombination process, leads {{to a change in}} constant region of the expressed antibody. Somatic hypermutation introduces multiple single nucleotide substitutions in and around the rearranged <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> segments and underpins affinity maturation. However, in chicken and rabbits (but not man or mouse), an additional mechanism, gene conversion, is a major contributor to <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> diversification [1]. It has been demonstrated recently that both switch recombination and hypermutation are ablated in mice and humans lacking AID, a B cell-specific protein of unknown molecular activity [2 – 4]. Here we show that disruption of AID in the DT 40 chicken B cell lymphoma leads to a failure to perform immunoglobulin <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> conversion. Thus, AID is required for all three immunoglobulin gene modification programs (gene conversion, hypermutation, and switch recombination) and acts in the initiation or execution of these processes rather than in bringing the B cell to an appropriate stage of differentiation...|$|R
40|$|The variable-region (<b>V)</b> <b>genes</b> of the murine T-cell {{receptor}} {{beta chain}} exist largely as single-element subfamilies. The V beta 5 and <b>V</b> beta 8 <b>genes</b> {{belong to the}} only two known three-member V beta subfamilies. We present studies on the linkage of these six genes and show that the genomic organization is that of alternating V beta 5 and <b>V</b> beta 8 <b>genes.</b> Our analysis suggests that these genes were tandemly duplicated, the unit of duplication being a pair of V beta 5 and <b>V</b> beta 8 <b>genes.</b> This tandem organization permits transcripts to initiate from the promoter of an unrearranged V beta located upstream of the rearranged <b>V</b> beta <b>gene.</b> These transcripts can generate functional beta-chain gene messages by novel RNA splicing of the upstream leader exon to the V beta coding exon of the downstream rearranged gene. We extend {{the analysis of the}} T-cell receptor genomic organization to include 12 <b>V</b> beta <b>genes</b> and suggest that all <b>V</b> beta <b>genes</b> are closely linked on chromosome 6.
