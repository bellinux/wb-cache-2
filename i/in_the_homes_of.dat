Flights and ferries out of Okinawa to neighbouring islands were cancelled, {{and as many}} as 3,500 tourists were left stranded at various airports because most hotels were already near full capacity. Other tourists reportedly stayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>of</b> some Okinawa residents, while some residents in landslide-prone areas evacuated to higher ground. Seven people were injured in Nanjo from a fallen signboard, while an elderly woman in Nago City and a young girl in Yaese suffered wind-related injuries.|$|E

In the same year, the Australian team came to Perth for its pre-Olympic training camp and were billeted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>of</b> members of the local swimming community. Brooks' family took his future relay team-mate Mark Tonelli, who had a reputation for indiscipline. Brooks, however, was inspired by Tonelli and cited him as a key motivating factor in him wanting to become an Olympian.|$|E
5|$|London {{was also}} full of black powder, {{especially}} {{along the river}} front. Much of it was left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>of</b> private citizens {{from the days of}} the English Civil War, as the former members of Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army still retained their muskets and the powder with which to load them. Five to six hundred tons of powder was stored in the Tower of London. The ship chandlers along the wharves also held large stocks, stored in wooden barrels.|$|E

The beginning of the 21st century has seen a resurgence in installations in concert halls. The organ boasts a substantial repertoire, which spans over 500years.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} workload—Hay {{wrote that he}} was busy 20 hours a day—he tried to make as normal a life as possible, eating his meals with Nicolay at Willard's Hotel, going to the theatre with Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln, and reading Les Misérables in French. Hay, still in his early 20s, spent time both in barrooms and at cultured get-togethers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>of</b> Washington's elite. The two {{secretaries}} often clashed with Mary Lincoln, who resorted to various stratagems to get the dilapidated White House restored without depleting Lincoln's salary, which had to cover entertainment and other expenses. Despite the secretaries' objections, Mrs. Lincoln was generally the victor and managed to spend almost 70% of her husband's salary in his four years in office.|$|E
5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>of</b> some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to health}} and {{economic}} benefits, the life expectancy in Nepal jumped from 27 years in 1951 to 65 in 2008. Most elderly Nepali citizens, roughly 85%, live in rural areas.

Traditionally, parents live with their children, and today, it is estimated that 90% of the elderly do live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>of</b> their family. This number is changing as more children leave home for work or school, leading to loneliness and mental problems in Nepali elderly.|$|E
