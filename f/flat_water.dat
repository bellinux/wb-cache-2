25|$|Indian <b>flat</b> <b>water</b> kayakers are an {{emerging}} powerhouse on the Asian circuit. Outside of professional <b>flat</b> <b>water</b> kayaking, {{there is very}} limited recreational kayaking. The potential to generate interest in <b>flat</b> <b>water</b> kayaking is held by leisure resorts located near the sea or other water bodies. Indian tourists tend to consider kayaking a one-time activity, rather than a sport to be pursued.|$|E
25|$|Windsurfing {{is common}} off the West Quay, usually {{at low tide}} in southwesterly winds. Kite surfing has become popular in recent years usually taking place east of the Harbour, due to its <b>flat</b> <b>water</b> {{conditions}} and exposure to the open sea.|$|E
25|$|With the {{popularity}} of watersports such as water skiing, wakeboarding, windsurfing and kitesurfing, Poole Harbour Commissioners have designated areas within the harbour almost exclusively for sport participation – virtually unrestricted from most regular harbour rules. Poole is also fortunate in that wind conditions are variable; wind conditions can be calm for sports such as wakeboarding, and {{a short while later}} strong for sports such as windsurfing. Most of these sports benefit from the harbour's generally <b>flat</b> <b>water</b> conditions. As a result, local watersport businesses operate around the harbour.|$|E

25|$|Rip {{currents}} are water {{channels that}} flow {{away from the}} shore. Under the wrong circumstances these currents can endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. Since a rip current {{appears to be an}} area of <b>flat</b> <b>water,</b> tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers may enter one and be carried out beyond the breaking waves. Although many rip currents are much smaller, the largest rip currents have a width of forty or fifty feet. However, by paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can easily exit a rip current. Alternatively, some surfers actually ride on a rip current because it is a fast and effortless way to get out beyond the zone of breaking waves.|$|E

50|$|Freeride: Boards {{meant for}} {{comfortable}} recreational cruising (mostly straight-line sailing and occasional turning) at planing speed (aka blasting), mainly in <b>flat</b> <b>waters</b> or in light to moderate swell. They typically {{fall into the}} volume range of 90 to 170 liters. The so-called freeride sailing movement diverged from course racing as more recreational sailors chose to sail freely without being constrained to sailing on courses around buoys.|$|R

2500|$|Both {{whitewater}} and <b>flat</b> <b>water</b> canoeing {{is possible}} on the Trent, with published guides and touring routes being listed for the river. There is a canoe slalom course at Stone, a purpose built [...] artificial course at Holme Pierrepont, and various weirs including those at Newark and Sawley are all used for whitewater paddling. Various canoe and kayak clubs paddle {{on the river}} including those at Stone, Burton, and Nottingham.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{a five-minute}} walk {{is a small}} two-lake reservoir, {{suitable}} for <b>flat</b> <b>water</b> kayaking, canoeing and windsurfing. A [...] walking and cycling trail surrounds the lakes. Bicycles, canoes, and cross-country skis are available for student use through the Recreation Center. The Department of Exercise and Sport Science offers three-day adventure trips (on weekends between courses) that are professionally supervised. These can include alpine skiing, rock climbing, white-water kayaking on the Wolf River in Wisconsin, horseback riding and canoe trips.|$|E
2500|$|The Assabet River rises at a swampy area in Westborough {{and flows}} {{northeast}} , starting at {{an elevation of}} [...] and descending through the towns of Northborough, Marlborough, Berlin, Hudson, Stow, Maynard, Acton, and finally Concord, where it merges with the Sudbury River to form the Concord River, at an elevation of 100ft (30 m). The dam in Hudson is one of nine either historic mill or flood control dams on the Assabet River. The back of the Hudson Public Library parking lot provides access to launch canoes or kayaks. Downstream is the dam, but upstream provides miles of <b>flat</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

Richwood is also home to Cherry Hill Country Club, a nine-hole golf course located on top of Hinkle Mountain.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{of these}} chine hulls {{has its own}} unique {{characteristics}} and use. The flat bottom hull has high initial stability but high drag. To counter the high drag [...] hull forms are narrow and sometimes severely tapered at bow and stern. This leads to poor stability when heeled in a sail boat. This is often countered by using heavy interior ballast on sailing versions. They are best suited to sheltered inshore waters. Early racing power boats were fine forward and flat aft. This produced maximum lift and a smooth,fast ride in <b>flat</b> <b>water</b> but this hull form is easily unsettled in waves. The multi chine hull approximates a curved hull form. It has less drag than a flat bottom boat. Multi chines are [...] more complex to build but produce a more seaworthy hull form. They are usually displacement hulls. V or arc bottom chine boats have a Vshape between 6and 23degrees. This is called the deadrise angle. The flatter shape of a 6degrees hull will plane with less wind or a lower horse power engine but will pound more in waves. The deep Vform (between 18and 23degrees) is only suited to high power planing boats. They require more powerful engines to lift the boat onto the plane but give a faster smoother ride in waves.|$|E
60|$|Cairo strikes one as unventilated and unsterilised, {{even when}} the sun and wind are {{scouring}} it together. The tourist talks a good deal, as you may see here, but the permanent European resident does not open his mouth more than is necessary--sound travels so far across <b>flat</b> <b>water.</b> Besides, the whole position of things, politically and administratively, is essentially false.|$|E

60|$|The {{schooner}} leaped as {{he spoke}} into the turmoil of roaring spray. In ten seconds she was through the passage, {{and there was a}} sudden and almost total cessation of heaving motion. The line of islands formed a perfect breakwater, and not a wave was formed, even by the roaring gale, bigger than those we find on such occasions in an ordinary harbour. As isle after isle was passed the sea became more and more smooth, and, although the surface was torn up and covered with foam, no great rollers heaved the vessel about. The tight little craft still bent over to the blast, but she cut through perfectly <b>flat</b> <b>water</b> now.|$|E
60|$|Pump.--An {{excellent}} and very simple pump {{is used by}} the Arabs in Algeria. A piece of leather or waxed canvas, is stretched round one or more hoops; it forms a hollow cylinder, that admits of being shut flat like an accordion. The top and bottom of the cylinder are secured round the edges of two discs of wood. Holes are bored in these discs and leather valves are fitted to them. The lower disc is nailed to the bottom of a tub; the hole in it corresponds with the feed-pipe, and the valve that covers the hole opens upwards. The upper disc Is attached to the pump handle; the valves that cover the holes in this disc, open upwards also. When the leather-pump barrel is pressed <b>flat,</b> <b>water</b> flows through the upper valves into the barrel around it; when it is pulled out, water is sucked up through the feed-pipe, and an equal quantity is displaced from the barrel. This flows out into the trough. A bag would do as well as a tub, to hold the water which surrounds the pump-barrel; but, without the water which it is the object of either the one or the other to contain, the pump-barrel must be air-proof as well as water-proof. The action of this pump is marvellously perfect. It attracted much attention in the French Exhibition of 1855.|$|E
60|$|It was half-past ten in {{the morning}} when Gwendolen Harleth, after her gloomy journey from Leubronn, arrived at the station from which she must drive to Offendene. No {{carriage}} or friend was awaiting her, for in the telegram she had sent from Dover she had mentioned a later train, and in her impatience of lingering at a London station she had set off without picturing what it would be to arrive unannounced at half an hour's drive from home--at one of those stations which have been fixed on not as near anywhere, but as equidistant from everywhere. Deposited as a femme sole with her large trunks, and having to wait while a vehicle was being got from the large-sized lantern called the Railway Inn, Gwendolen felt that the dirty paint in the waiting-room, the dusty decanter of <b>flat</b> <b>water,</b> and the texts in large letters calling on her to repent and be converted, were part of the dreary prospect opened by her family troubles; and she hurried away to the outer door looking toward the lane and fields. But here the very gleams of sunshine seemed melancholy, for the autumnal leaves and grass were shivering, and the wind was turning up the feathers of a cock and two croaking hens which had doubtless parted with their grown-up offspring and {{did not know what to}} do with themselves. The railway official also seemed without resources, and his innocent demeanor in observing Gwendolen and her trunks was rendered intolerable by the cast in his eye; especially since, being a new man, he did not know her, and must conclude that she was not very high in the world. The vehicle--a dirty old barouche--was within sight, and was being slowly prepared by an elderly laborer. Contemptible details these, to make part of a history; yet the turn of most lives is hardly to be accounted for without them. They are continually entering with cumulative force into a mood until it gets the mass and momentum of a theory or a motive. Even philosophy is not quite free from such determining influences; and to be dropped solitary at an ugly, irrelevant-looking spot, with a sense of no income on the mind, might well prompt a man to discouraging speculation on the origin of things and the reason of a world where a subtle thinker found himself so badly off. How much more might such trifles tell on a young lady equipped for society with a fastidious taste, an Indian shawl over her arm, some twenty cubic feet of trunks by her side, and a mortal dislike to the new consciousness of poverty which was stimulating her imagination of disagreeables? At any rate they told heavily on poor Gwendolen, and helped to quell her resistant spirit. What was the good of living in the midst of hardships, ugliness, and humiliation? This was the beginning of being at home again, and it was a sample of what she had to expect.|$|E
