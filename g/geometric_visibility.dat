"Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 27) Turn signals {{mounted on}} exterior rearview mirrors {{are increasingly being}} used as original equipment on passenger cars and light trucks. The potential for mirror-mounted turn signals (MMTS) to improve the <b>geometric</b> <b>visibility</b> of turn signals is examined in this report. A survey of U. S. and European regulations showed that the turn signals of a vehicle that is minimally compliant with U. S. regulations are not visible to a driver of a nearby vehicle in an adjacent lane. Measurements of mirror location and window geometry were made on 74 passenger cars and light trucks, including 38 vehicles with European-style side repeaters. These data were combined with data on driver eye locations from two previous studies to assess the relative visibility of MMTS and conventional signals. Simulations were conducted to examine the potential for signals to be obstructed when a driver looks laterally through the passenger-side window. With a vehicle population that is fifty percent light trucks, MMTS are visible 52 percent more often than European side repeaters in this scenario. Based on the lateral visibility analysis, the optimal height for <b>geometric</b> <b>visibility</b> of a signal in the adjacent-vehicle scenario is 124 cm above the ground, approximately the average height of a light truck mirror. A plan-view eccentricity analysis showed that an MMTS is {{much closer to the}} viewing driver’s forward-directed line of sight than rear-mounted turn signals when the viewing driver’s vehicle is in or near the blind zone between the signaling driver’s mirror and direct peripheral fields of view. The report concludes that MMTS can improve the <b>geometric</b> <b>visibility</b> of turn signals in the adjacent-vehicle scenario that is believed to precede many lane-change/merge crashes. Further research will be necessary to determine if improved <b>geometric</b> <b>visibility</b> is accompanied by improved detection of turn signals by viewing drivers, and whether improved detection of turn signals has important safety implications...|$|E

These techniques are not well-suited to interactive applications, because evaluating the contribution of large sets of point lights can require a great deal of computation. In this work we present an approach to rendering scenes containing large numbers of lights, using programmable graphics hardware. Our approach uses a <b>geometric</b> <b>visibility</b> determination algorithm in order to avoid performing visibility computation at the pixel level. In addition, by pre-computing and storing visibility information, and amortizing the update cost over several frames, we are able to support scenes containing moving objects. We apply our techniques to the problems of rendering soft shadows from area light sources, and diffuse indirect illumination, and are able to render screen-sized images of scenes with several hundred lights at interactive speeds...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{rendering}} complex models was first addressed in terrain rendering using view-dependent levels of detail [93]. Due {{to the increasing}} speed of graphics cards – triangle can be rendered faster than send over the bus – recent algorithms assemble pre-computed terrain patches run-time to reduce the per-triangle computation cost on the CPU and shift the bottleneck back to the GPU like [71] and the RUSTiC [138] and CABTT [115] data structures. These methods were further improved by representing the patches within the nodes as irregular triangulated patches in a quadtree [105] or a binary tree domain [30]. Unfortunately these algorithms cannot be used directly for arbitrary 3 D models since they rely on a parametrization of the mesh which is only trivial for terrain models. Many methods {{have been developed for}} the visualization of large models. They are based on the three main approaches <b>geometric</b> simplification, <b>visibility</b> culling and image based representations.

40|$|We {{accept the}} {{implicit}} challenge of A. Uhlmann in his 1994 paper, "Parallel Lifts and Holonomy along Density Operators: Computable Examples Using O(3) -Orbits," by, in fact, computing the holonomy invariants for rotations of certain n-level Gibbsian density matrices (n = 2, [...] ., 11). From these, we derive, by the tracing operation, the associated <b>geometric</b> phases and <b>visibilities,</b> which we analyze and display. We then proceed analogously, implementing the alternative methodology presented by E. Sjoqvist et al in their letter, "Geometric Phases for Mixed States in Interferometry" (Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 2845 [2000]). For the Uhlmann case, {{we are able}} to also compute several higher-order invariants. We compare the various <b>geometric</b> phases and <b>visibilities</b> for different values of n, and also directly compare the two forms of analysis. By setting one parameter (a) in the Uhlmann analysis to zero, we find that the so-reduced form of the first-order holonomy invariant is simply equal to (- 1) ^n+ 1 times the holonomy invariant in the Sjöqvist et al method. Additional phenomena of interest are reported too. Comment: 61 pages, LaTeX, 105 (compressed) encapsulated postscript MATHEMATICA figures.

One or more ground-based optical terminals are assumed {{to communicate with the}} spacecraft. Both short-term and long-term link outages will arise due to weather at the ground station(s), space platform pointing stability, and other effects. To mitigate these outages, an Automatic Repeat Query (ARQ) retransmission method is assumed, together with a reliable back channel for acknowledgement traffic. Specifically, the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) is used, which is a component of the Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocol suite that is well suited for high bandwidth-delay product links subject to disruptions. We provide an analysis of envisioned deep space mission scenarios and quantify buffering, latency and throughput performance, using a simulation in which long-term weather effects are modeled with a Gilbert -Elliot Markov chain, short-term outages occur as a Bernoulli process, and scheduled outages arising from <b>geometric</b> <b>visibility</b> or operational constraints are represented.

40|$|Sight {{distance}} {{along the}} highway {{plays a significant role}} in road safety and in particular, has a clear impact on the choice of speed limits. Visibility distance is thus of importance for road engineers and authorities. While visibility distance criteria are routinely taken into account in road design, few systems exist for estimating it on existing road networks. Most available systems comprise a target vehicle followed at a constant distance by an observer vehicle, which only allows to check if a given, fixed visibility distance is available. We propose two new approaches for estimating the maximum available visibility distance, involving only one vehicle and based on different sensor technologies, namely binocular stereovision and 3 D range sensing (LIDAR). The first approach involves the processing of two views taken by digital cameras onboard an inspection vehicle. The main stages of the process are : road segmentation, edge registration between the two views, 3 D reconstruction of the road profile and finally, maximum roadway visibility distance estimation. The second approach is based on a Terrestrial LIDAR Mobile Mapping System. The triangulated 3 D model of the road and its surroundings provided by the system is used to simulate targets at different distances, which allows for estimation of the maximum <b>geometric</b> <b>visibility</b> distance along the pathway.

30|$|In {{this section}} we review {{the concept of}} {{visibility}} diagram, {{as it is a}} key element for the remainder of this paper. In [12] we adopted this representation for generating a specialized data structure that could swiftly provide information on how to trace acoustic beams and rays in real time with the rules of specular reflection. This approach constitutes a generalization of the beam tracing algorithm proposed by Hanrahan and Heckbert [5]. The visibility diagram is a re-mapping of the geometric structures and functional elements that constitute the geometric world (rays, beams, reflectors, sources, receivers, etc.) onto a special parameter space that is completely dual to the <b>geometric</b> one. <b>Visibility</b> diagrams are particularly useful for immediately assessing what is in the line of sight from a generic location and direction in space. We will first recount the basic concepts of visibility diagrams and provide a general view of the path-tracing problem for the specific case of purely specular reflections. This overview will be provided in a slightly more general fashion than in [12], as all the algorithmic steps will be given with reference to visibility diagrams, and will constitute the starting point for the discussions in the following sections.|$|R

This challenging control problem {{is complex and}} combines both <b>geometric</b> constraints, <b>visibility</b> requirements, and aesthetic elements. Therefore, existing optimizationbased approaches for human action overview are often too demanding for online computation. In this paper, we introduce an effective automatic camera control which is extremely efficient and allows online performance. Rather than optimizing a complex quality measurement, at each time it selects one active camera from a multitude of cameras that render the dynamic scene. The selection {{is based on the}} correlation between each view stream and the human motion in the scene. Two factors allow for rapid selection among tens of candidate views in real-time, even for complex multi-character scenes: the efficient rendering of the multitude of view streams, and optimized calculations of the correlations using modified CCA. In addition to the method’s simplicity and speed, it exhibits good agreement with both cinematic idioms and previous human motion camera control work. Our evaluations show that the method is able to cope with the challenges put forth by severe occlusions, multiple characters and complex scenes. 1...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that mirror-mounted turn signals have {{advantages}} over conventional turn signals in terms of their <b>geometric</b> <b>visibility</b> and conspicuity in several important situations. This study was designed to (1) develop methods for evaluating the effects of mirror-mounted turn signals on both the frequency and severity of relevant crashes, and (2) provide an illustrative application of these approaches. We presented arguments suggesting that a viable approach involves a longitudinal comparison of the crash experience of vehicle models that had an abrupt year-to-year change from 0 % to 100 % installation. Several crash scenarios were identified that might be sensitive to the presence of mirror-mounted turn signals, including changing lanes, merging, making turns, and leaving a parked position. We identified 13 vehicle models in the U. S. that had the desirable abrupt change in the installation of mirror-mounted turn signals. An illustrative analysis was then performed on the crash experience of these 13 vehicle models using the North Carolina crash database. The results indicate a tendency for vehicles with mirror-mounted turn signals to be less likely involved in turn-signal-related crashes, but the effect was not statistically significant. Furthermore, the results were inconclusive concerning the possibility of a reduction in crash severity for vehicles with mirror-mounted turn signals. As manufacturers adopt mirror-mounted turn signals on more vehicle models, the target population of vehicles for a crash analysis will increase. At that point, the approach illustrated in this report could be used to perform a more definitive analysis of the safety benefits of mirrormounted turn signals...|$|E

Mapping visibility distance is thus of importance for road engineers and authorities. While visibility distance criteria are routinely taken into account in road design, few systems exist for evaluating them on existing road networks. Most available systems comprise a target vehicle followed at a constant distance by an observer vehicle. This only allows to check if a given, fixed visibility distance is available: estimating the maximum visibility distance requires several passages, with increasing inter-vehicle intervals. We propose two alternative approaches for estimating the maximum available visibility distance, that exploit 3 D models of the road and its close environment.

A quantitative description {{is provided by the}} dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction. As a result, and somehow counter-intuitively, the widths of dislocation images become narrower when the associated rocking curves are large. Thus, strong reflections of low diffraction order are particularly appropriate for topographic imaging. They permit topographists to obtain narrow, well-resolved images of dislocations, and to separate single dislocations even when the dislocation density in a material is rather high. In more unfavourable cases (weak, high-order reflections, higher photon energies), dislocation images become broad, diffuse, and overlap for high and medium dislocation densities. Highly ordered, strongly diffracting materials - like minerals or semiconductors - are generally unproblematic, whereas e.g. protein crystals are particularly challenging for topographic imaging.|$|R
40|$|Measuring {{transportation}} network reliability in destabilizing {{events is}} a complex task because an accurate modeling requires the inclusion of uncertainty in both the infrastructure and the users' behavior. This paper presents an approach for evaluating the performance reliability, considering the uncertainty in both demand and supply {{sides of the road}} network due to an unexpected event. These uncertainties are likely due to the effect of natural disasters on road networks. On the supply side, in addition to link capacity, environment parameters of roads, which indirectly influence parameters of link travel time, are degraded after disasters. Road environment parameters, such as <b>visibility,</b> <b>geometric,</b> pavement condition, and safety elements, impact road capacity by a perceived increased cost or inability to travel. A generalized link travel cost is suggested to capture these effects. On the demand side, elastic demand is modeled with lognormal distribution and a logit-based stochastic user equilibrium is formulated to presents the traveler's uncertain behavior in route choice. In this study, the first order second moment reliability method is used to evaluate network reliability. This paper presents a numerical example that shows the result of ignoring uncertainties after a disaster is overestimated. Also, it was observed that increasing variation of demand and supply decreases the network performance and network reliability, and the increasing knowledge of the user in route choice behavior increases the network efficiency.

Background. In geometric computing, combinatorial decisions often rely on numerical computations. This dependence is encapsulated {{in the notion of}} predicates, that is decisions made by an algorithm to choose which branch to follow in its computation tree. The evaluation of a predicate usually reduces to computing the sign of a mathematical expression, such an expression being called an evaluation strategy for the predicate. Often, a predicate has several strategies, some more efficient than others. For instance, to test if a degree 2 polynomial equation in one variable has two distinct real solutions, one could compute these solutions and compare them, or simply evaluate the sign of the discriminant of the polynomial. The former requires to manipulate square roots in the coefficients of the polynomial, while the latter is less demanding and only uses polynomial expressions.

This enables a learning effect that may bias the results over time. To address this problem we have developed a variable pattern for the quality assurance of monitors (MoniQA) that allows an evaluation of contrast <b>visibility,</b> <b>geometric</b> distortion, resolution, global image quality including uniformity, and artifacts.
