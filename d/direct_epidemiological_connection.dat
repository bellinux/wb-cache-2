Predisposing factors consisted of smoking, airway abnormalities, substance abuse, diabetes or poor general condition, but in two patients no risk factor was identified. In the five patients tested, no abnormalities or deficiencies were detected in the innate or adaptive type- 1 immunity. All M. kansasii isolates had identical MPTR RFLP patterns, although no <b>epidemiological</b> <b>connection</b> could be established, and these were identical to those of clinical isolates from Australian patients.

Thirty-four isolates presented a multidrug resistance including resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Thirty-six cases involved children and 30 of these were adopted from Ethiopia.

Results were compared to microarray hybridisation results of clinical isolates of ST 772 -MRSA-V, of related strains and to another ST 772 -MRSA-V genome sequence. Results: According to MLST e-burst analysis, ST 772 -MRSA-V belongs to Clonal Complex (CC) 1, differing from ST 1 only in one MLST allele (pta- 22). However, there are several additional differences including agr alleles (group II rather than III), capsule type (5 rather than 8), the presence of the egc enterotoxin gene cluster and of the enterotoxin homologue ORF CM 14 as well as the absence of the enterotoxin H gene seh.

Understanding the genetic relatedness of meningococci strains may be useful for epidemiological control of meningococcal infection. To study clonal diversity and its relationships to pathogenicity, serogroup and penicillin susceptibility, we analyzed 99 strains of N. meningitidis, 53 from patients and 46 from asymptomatic carriers isolated during 1992 - 2001, by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Endonuclease NheI restricted all strains resulting in 50 PFGE patterns. The strains from patients and from carriers were classified into 30 and 26 patterns, respectively. Two PFGE patterns overlapped in both groups with no known <b>epidemiological</b> <b>connection.</b> The results may imply that the virulent strains would probably colonize the upper respiratory without causing disease. Serogroup A strains (11 from patients and 8 from carriers) revealed a closely related group within 1 PFGE pattern whereas serogroup B strains (35 from patients and 12 from carriers) presented the most diversity with 32 PFGE patterns. Relative resistance to penicillin was found in 5 serogroup B strains (3 from patients and 2 from carriers) showing different PFGE patterns. All carrier strains that are not serogroups A, B, C, Y and W 135, showed different PFGE patterns. These data indicate serogrouping alone is insufficient for epidemiological investigations and clonal transmission among N. meningitidis is infrequent.

Susceptibilities were determined by agar dilution, and blaKPC and Tn 4401 -like elements were sought by PCR and sequencing. Isolates were compared by PFGE of XbaI- and SpeI-digested genomic DNA. Results The isolates were from patients in different UK hospitals, with no <b>epidemiological</b> <b>connection.</b> Both were resistant to carbapenems (MICs > 16 mg/L), with imipenem MICs unchanged by EDTA, and also to all other ß-lactams (including inhibitor combinations), tobramycin, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. They were susceptible to gentamicin (MICs = 1 mg/L) and colistin (MICs = 0. 5 mg/L), with intermediate susceptibility to tigecycline (MICs 1 – 2 mg/L). The isolates belonged to the same PFGE-defined strain, highly related to a disseminated KPC-producing strain characterized previously in Tel Aviv, Israel.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of <b>direct</b> <b>epidemiological</b> evidence, {{molecular}} evolutionary studies of primate lentiviruses provide the most definitive information {{about the origins of}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - 1 and HIV- 2. Related lentiviruses have been found infecting numerous species of primates in sub-Saharan Africa. The only species naturally infected with viruses closely related to HIV- 2 is the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys) from western Africa, the region where HIV- 2 is known to be endemic. Similarly, the only viruses very closely related to HIV- 1 have been isolated from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and in particular those from western equatorial Africa, again coinciding with the region that appears to be the hearth of the HIV- 1 pandemic. HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 have each arisen several times: in the case of HIV- 1, the three groups (M, N and O) are the result of independent cross-species transmission events. Consistent with the phylogenetic position of a 'fossil' virus from 1959, molecular clock analyses using realistic models of HIV- 1 sequence evolution place the last common ancestor of the M group prior to 1940, and several lines of evidence indicate that the jump from chimpanzees to humans occurred before then. Both the inferred geographical origin of HIV- 1 and the timing of the cross-species transmission are inconsistent with the suggestion that oral polio vaccines, putatively contaminated with viruses from chimpanzees in eastern equatorial Africa in the late 1950 s, could be responsible for the origin of acquired immune deficiency syndrome...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The rate {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection in Iran has increased dramatically {{in the past few}} years. While the earliest cases were among hemophiliacs, injection drug users (IDUs) fuel the current epidemic. Previous molecular epidemiological analysis found that subtype A was most common among IDUs but more recent studies suggest CRF_ 35 AD may be more prevalent now. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the molecular epidemiology of HIV- 1 infection in Iran, we analyzed all Iranian HIV sequence data from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. METHODS: All Iranian HIV sequences from subtyping studies with pol, gag, env and full-length HIV- 1 genome sequences registered in the HIV databases (www. hiv. lanl. gov) between 2006 and 2013 were downloaded. Phylogenetic trees of each region were constructed using Neighbor-Joining (NJ) and Maximum Parsimony methods. RESULTS: A total of 475 HIV sequences were analyzed. Overall, 78 % of sequences were CRF_ 35 AD. By gene region, CRF_ 35 AD comprised 83 % of HIV- 1 pol, 62 % of env, 78 % of gag, and 90 % of full-length genome sequences analyzed. There were 240 sequences re-categorized as CRF_AD. The proportion of CRF_ 35 AD sequences categorized by the present study is nearly double the proportion of what had been reported. CONCLUSIONS: Phylogenetic analysis indicates HIV- 1 subtype CRF_ 35 AD is the predominant circulating strain in Iran. This result differed from previous studies that reported subtype A as most prevalent in HIV- infected patients but confirmed other studies which reported CRF_ 35 AD as predominant among IDUs. The observed <b>epidemiological</b> <b>connection</b> between HIV strains circulating in Iran and Afghanistan may be due to drug trafficking and/or immigration between the two countries. This finding suggests the possible origins and transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS within Iran and provides useful information for designing control and intervention strategies...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is an {{opportunistic}} Gram positive pathogen and the causative {{agent of}} many {{human and animal}} diseases. It {{is also an important}} human foodbome pathogen. Certain strains of S. aureus can produce staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) in foods and cause staphylococcal food poisonings (SFP). In recent years S. aureus has been increasingly associated with antibiotic resistance. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) includes those strains that have acquired genes conferring resistance to methicillin and essentially all other beta-lactam antibiotics. MRSA was initially reported as a nosocomial pathogen in human hospitals (or hospital-associated MRSA, HA-MRSA). Since the 1990 s, community-acquired or community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections have also been reported to affect people having no <b>epidemiological</b> <b>connection</b> with hospitals. More recently, MRSA has been isolated from most food-producing animals and foods of animal origin, raising public health concerns. MRSA strains have been isolated from cows' or small ruminants' milk and various dairy products in many countries. The MRSA prevalence in milk and dairy products recorded in different countries or even regions of the same country differs significantly. High MRSA prevalence have been recorded in milk produced in most African countries, for instance as high as 60. 3 % in Ethiopia. The MRSA prevalence in Asian countries varies from high e. g. 28. 3 % in Iran to low (e. g. in Korea and Japan). In most European countries, the MRSA prevalence in milk and dairy products has been generally found to be low. In the US and Canada, zero to low MRSA prevalence estimates have been reported. The investigation of MRSA prevalence in milk may serve as a tool for assessing both the sanitary conditions employed in dairy herds and the health risks that humans may encounter when infected with antibiotic-resistant strains...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Sex steroid hormones {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{to play a role}} in the development of non-epithelial ovarian cancers (NEOC) but so far no <b>direct</b> <b>epidemiological</b> data are available. METHODS: A case-control study was nested within the Finnish Maternity Cohort, the world's largest bio-repository of serum specimens from pregnant women. Study subjects were selected among women who donated a blood sample during a singleton pregnancy that led to the birth of their last child preceding diagnosis of NEOC. Case subjects were 41 women with sex-cord stromal tumors (SCST) and 21 with germ cell tumors (GCT). Three controls, matching the index case for age, parity at the index pregnancy, and date at blood donation were selected (n= 171). Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) associated with concentrations of testosterone, androstenedione, 17 -OH-progesterone, progesterone, estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were estimated through conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: For SCST, doubling of testosterone, androstenedione and 17 -OH-progesterone concentrations were associated with about 2 -fold higher risk of SCST [ORs and 95 % CI of 2. 16 (1. 25 - 3. 74), 2. 16 (1. 20 - 3. 87), and 2. 62 (1. 27 - 5. 38), respectively]. These associations remained largely unchanged after excluding women within 2, 4 or 6 years lag-time between blood donation and cancer diagnosis. Sex steroid hormones concentrations were not related to maternal risk of GCT. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective study providing initial evidence that elevated androgens play a role in the pathogenesis of SCST. Impact: Our study may note a particular need for larger confirmatory investigations on sex steroids and NEOC...|$|R
