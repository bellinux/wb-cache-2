50|$|<b>Dicirenone</b> (INN, USAN) (developmental {{code name}} SC-26304), {{also known as}} 7α-carboxyisopropylspirolactone, is a synthetic, steroidal antimineralocorticoid of the spirolactone group which was {{developed}} as a diuretic and antihypertensive agent but was never marketed. It was synthesized and assayed in 1974. Similarly to other spirolactones like spironolactone, <b>dicirenone</b> also possesses antiandrogen activity, albeit with relatively reduced affinity.|$|E

Oxprenoate potassium (RU-28318) is not a spirolactone by definition but is a closely related antimineralocorticoid that was never marketed.|$|E
