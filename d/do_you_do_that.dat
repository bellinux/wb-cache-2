40|$|ABSTRACT. Is {{consciousness}} or {{the subject}} {{part of the}} natural world or the human world? Can we write intentionality, so central in Husserl's philosophy, into Quine's system of ontological naturalism and naturalized epistemology- or into Heidegger's account of human being and existential phenomenology? The present task is to show how to do so. Anomalous monism provides a key. If you Husserl a Quine, you get a Follesdal. But how in the world of philosophy <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> Fellow-travelers in the border country of phenomenology and inten-sional logic have long marveled at the sure and natural stride with which this walker of distant and beautiful terrain, Dagfinn Follesdal, combines the intellectual virtues of two so disparate philosophers: Ed-mund Husserl, phenomenologist, and Willard Van Orman Quine, logi-cian. Here I want to seek out a path less traveled, orienteering the status of intentionality in Quine and Husserl- and Heidegger by the way. 1. SUBJECT AND OBJECT The subject/object of these reflections is the subject-object relation. How is the knowing subject related to the object known? Is the subject part of the world of objects known? More generally, {{what is the nature of}} the intentional relation between subject and object in intentional attitudes or activities of believing, perceiving, desiring, etc. ? Opposing views are spied in the writings of Husserl, Heidegger, and Quine. For Quine, human knowledge is a natural phenomenon, to be studied by natural science. For Husserl, intentionality- representation in consciousness- is an extra-natural phenomenon, to be studied in the transcendental science of phenomenology. For Heidegger, intentional-ity- our comportment toward entities in the world- is part of the familiar human world in which we live; our intentional activity is par...|$|E

40|$|Tutor: So, essay writing [...] . Student: Yeah, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> This paper {{sheds light}} on what happens behind the closed door of the {{academic}} writing tutorial. Whilst {{there has been some}} empirical research on classroom interaction and dyadic tutorials, there has been little examination of the talk that occurs between tutor and student in one-to-one academic writing tutorials. The paper will present the findings of a study that used conversation analysis (CA) to examine the talk of individual academic writing tutorials at a small college-based Higher Education (HE) campus, where many students have vocational backgrounds. Undergraduate students with vocational qualifications often have less experience with academic writing than their peers who study A-levels (Parry, 2012). However, college-based HE students also share many of the characteristics and challenges of ‘non-traditional’ HE students (Caldwell and Cattermole, 2015). The study aimed to understand how tutorials are organised, how identities are established and how learning is developed. Data from 17 tutorials carried out with students from a range of courses and years were analysed using CA (Drew & Heritage, 1992). The analysis revealed a number of strategies employed to negotiate goals between tutor and student, and how talk is used to achieve neutrality, correction and repair. Within this context, there is a paucity of research offering guidance for tutors to develop these strategies in the one-to-one tutorial. These findings will therefore fill this gap by providing a resource for practitioners to interrogate and reflect on good practice for conducting academic writing tutorials.

40|$|Sustainable {{harvesting}} of {{tree bark}} Cue: Sometimes, {{there is a}} fine line between creating a business opportunity and endangering the environment. Some species of tree, for example, have bark which {{can be used to make}} effective and valuable medicines. But harvesting bark must be done carefully, or else the tree may die and be unable to provide bark for future generations. Many communities cut down trees which provide effective herbal remedies, or kill them by stripping their bark, when actually they could just use a small part of the tree, and preserve the rest. So how can sustainable harvesting of tree bark be done? It is not a simple question, because the method will vary according to the type of tree. It is this kind of information that the Forestry Research Institute of Malawi, or FRIM, is spreading among communities. The Institute is also advising communities on how they can grow more of their precious herbal trees. Patrick Mphaka spoke to Gerald Meke, a Senior Research Officer at FRIM, to find out exactly what they have been doing. IN:		?Normally what we have been doing ? OUT:		? there is a big market for these traditional medicines. ? DUR?N:	 6 ? 12 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Gerald Meke of the Forestry Research Institute of Malawi. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Meke	Normally what we have been doing; for example if we see people are using bark, then we would go and test trees to see how they respond to the removal of bark. If for example the tree dies because the bark has been removed, then we have to come up with alternatives like, one: we would encourage these people to establish an orchard or a plantation of those particular trees, so that when they reach a certain age, they can harvest the whole tree and remove all the bark. Because if they just remove a small portion, it will die. But for some trees, like for example Prunus africana, it heals when you remove a piece of bark. So you would encourage these people to harvest a small section of the bark from a particular side of the tree, and then leave that area to grow back maybe for two to three years. Then after that they can go and harvest on the other side of the tree, and they can continue in that type of circular harvesting pattern, and then the tree will not die. But as I said, the trees that will die if they harvest the bark, then there are options like, for example, establishing a plantation, as I said. Or the other option is to look at other aspects like leaves or fruits, which, when harvested, they can not affect the tree. But you have to make sure that you look at if the chemical that cures a particular disease is available also in the leaves, then you can advise them to go for the leaves. Or then you can provide alternative sources of parts of the plant that these people can harvest. Mphaka	One of the stakeholders in that area of traditional medicines are the traditional doctors themselves, and it is a very secretive area. What kind of cooperation have you been having with them in order to know what type of plants they use and how much you can assist them? Meke	That area is one of the serious challenges that most researchers meet. But with traditional healers, you find that if you can show to them that you can be trusted, these people are very easy to work with. Once you are clear of what you want the information for and what you are going to use it for, then they can easily cooperate with you. And whatever we do, we try as much as possible to run away from things like: to give us the name of the tree which they use for what particular type of disease; how they prepare the medicine, and all that. That type of information on how they prepare the medicine and all that, we have tried to avoid that because that is what they mostly they keep it as a secret. But just to indicate to us what trees they use, what plants they use, that is not very difficult. Because as foresters, our concern is that there is a lot of deforestation, over-harvesting and all that. So, if these people are to continue getting whatever medicinal plants, then it means they have to work with us to help them on how best they can propagate them, and also to come up with how best they can harvest. So, it is like to their advantage. So, after explaining these things properly to them, then they trust us and we develop a good working relationship and then they tell us the necessary information that we need as foresters to advise them. Mphaka	One of the biggest challenges which researchers face is the fact that whatever they have found out to be solutions, things which work, the problem comes in when they have to disseminate that information to the targeted audience. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> yourselves? Meke	That one is a very serious challenge for us. But for example, with FRIM, we are working in the forest department and the forest department has got an extension unit. So normally what we do is, whatever technologies we develop, we pass them on to our colleagues in the extension area so that they develop messages which can be given out to people and people can easily take them up. The other way is we try as much as possible to use the mass media like the radio, also the newspapers and give out information. Mphaka	This area of traditional healers and traditional medicines, and looking at the trees which Malawi can provide as a nation, is looked at as an area which is kind of worthless. For you to spend all that time and effort to look at the area, do you think it is an area that can provide wealth to anybody at all? Meke	At first that is the impression that people get when they have not had a chance to look at that particular area. For example, with the issue of traditional medicine, almost every Malawian uses traditional medicine. Ten million people using traditional medicine. Look at the damage that would happen to forests if all those people are to get that traditional medicine. You will find that there is a lot that is being taken out. So, as foresters, our concern is, if all these people are using these plants, then very soon we will have nothing. For example, if you look at the issue of wealth creation, you find that one: the area of 10 million people wanting medicine; maybe people in the village they would not charge a lot of money to some one if they were to treat them, but there are, for example, people who can harvest and then sell across the border. For example we have people who harvest traditional medicine in Malawi and sell in South Africa. They make money. If they were not making money, they would not waste a lot of money to buy a ticket to go to South Africa. So there is money that is being made. You also find traditional medicine being sold in pharmacies. So, maybe for us in Malawi, it is just a matter of time when may be, some people will think of making cough mixtures, using traditional medicine. So very soon we will have these on the market; so there is a big market for these traditional medicines. End of track. Forestry research is discovering and communicating better techniques for harvesting medicinal bark, to prevent trees dying...|$|E
40|$|Keeping milk clean Cue: Milk {{is a very}} {{important}} food, particularly for growing children. For example, it contains large amounts of calcium, which is vital for the growth of strong bones. But milk is also a very suitable environment for bacteria to grow, so keeping it free from dirt is essential. The greatest risk of dirt entering the milk is probably during the actual time of milking. But by following some simple procedures, farmers can minimise the chances of contamination. Gabriel Karanja is a Kenyan dairy farmer and milk trader who has recently been given training in safe milk handling. He spoke to Susie Emmett about some of these important procedures for keeping milk clean. IN:		?You see there is a shed ?? OUT:		??water or anything to your milk. ? DUR?N		 6 ? 30 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Eliana Mushi of the Kalali Women?s Group. Earlier, Susie Emmett was talking to Gabriel Karanja, a Kenyan dairy farmer and milk trader. Transcript Karanja	You see there is a shed, there is the milking shed where you go and milk the cows. Then that is where you wash your hands with soap and the clean water. Then you get the warm water and a clean cloth, now you wash the underside of the cow. Emmett	So that is the udder and the teats under the cow, you wash them with warm water. And why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> Karanja	If you milk that cow without washing the udder and the teats there is a problem because this cow where it was sleeping there is dust, there is everything, and sometimes they can lie on the dung. But cleaning the udder first, you are taking care of any contamination of the milk from the cow. So now then you bring your container which you have washed previously, you have sterilised it with hot water, you have made it dry, that is when you milk your cow. Emmett	And you are making a point about not just washing, not just sterilising but things must be dry too? Karanja	Yes, after washing you dry the teats with a dry towel. Before training we used to apply the milking salve but later after training we came to realise milking with a salve can also contaminate the milk. Emmett		So a salve is like a cream that you put on the teats? Karanja	Cream yes. You see the salve is to keep the teats soft so that it cannot crack. But if you milk you use the salve on the teats, when you are milking the cow part of the salve might enter the milk. Emmett	So the cream that you put on the teat can come through your hands and then on to the milk? Karanja	Because the milk is hot. Emmett		Into the container? Karanja	Yes. So the best thing is you milk before you apply the salve and then you apply later after milking, then you can now apply the salve so that it can preserve the teats. Emmett	And what about if you have got a cow that tends to kick or fidget or swish her tail as the milking is going on, how can you stop that so that dirt does not get dropped into the milk? Karanja	That one is controlled by tying you see, but these days we have a locking stick. Emmett		So a piece of wood that you put behind the legs? Karanja	Behind and in front of the legs. Behind so that the cow cannot go out and then in front so that it cannot kick. Then the tail, you tie the tail by the post. And also the other thing we used to sometimes to feed the cow when we are milking. Also that one can contaminate the milk because when it is feeding it is a bit dusty, so this dust can also contaminate the milk. Emmett		So as she feeds she can blow dust from the feed down into the milk? Karanja	Yes so the best thing is you first milk and then you feed it after. Emmett	And then hopefully you have got this lovely clean milk in a lovely clean container. What is it important to do next? Karanja	Now the other thing, so you have to sieve, the milk has to be sieved, from the container from where you are milking to the clean container which carries this milk. Emmett		Through a piece of cloth? Karanja	The sieving, you have a sieve, then you have a clean piece of cloth. Emmett	So sieving or straining the milk into another container will help to remove any small pieces of hair or dust? Karanja	Yes. Emmett	A final question, are there sometimes when if you have treated the cow with a medicine you cannot sell the milk? Karanja	Yes you do not deliver that milk. Because the medicine which has treated the cow it is not fit for human consumption. So if you deliver this milk to your customers, you are making them sick because you are giving them poison. Actually the cow medicine is poisonous for the human beings. Emmett		That is how you think of it? Karanja	Yes that is what I have been taught in the training. Emmett	And so are you careful if you use medicines for mastitis, for infections of the udder or worm medicines, you read the instructions carefully? Karanja	You read the instructions, even not only me, even my suppliers, the other farmers who supply milk to me. I have to instruct them and I tell them if you treat a cow you follow the instructions, if the veterinary officer tells you to take three days, you bring the milk after the three days. That is the time I would take the milk. Emmett		So you sound like a really professional milkman? Karanja	So that I continue with my business, because that is why I am getting my delivery. NARR	Gabriel Karanja, serious about the business of keeping the milk he sells clean. In the town of Moshi in northern Tanzania, the Kalali Women?s Group is also involved in processing and selling milk. Speaking on the telephone, Lazarus Laiser asked Eliana Mushi, one of the group members, about how they maintain high standards of hygiene in their milk. Laiser		How do you test milk from the farmers and ensure that it is clean? Mushi	(Vernac) We test the milk by using lactometer, water thermometer and it shows if it has any contamination or not. Laiser		How do you prevent dirt contaminating the milk? Mushi	(Vernac) After receiving the milk we put in the can and boil in water whilst in the can. After boiling we put again in a well-washed can and close them well and keep safely until cold. Immediately after pouring milk from the can we wash and put them to dry waiting for other milk. Laiser		Have you received milk which is contaminated? Mushi	(Vernac) Yes, we often receive milk which is contaminated with water and other impurities. Such milk we cannot use it. Laiser		It is only a water problem or are there other problems? Mushi	(Vernac) Not water only but other dirt like cow dung caused by not well washed udder. You can feel even by smelling. Others put wheat flour to have more milk. Others water and once we receive this milk we always send back to the farmer. Laiser		How do you advise the farmers especially the process of milking? Mushi	(Vernac) They have to follow instructions on how to milk. They should wash the udder with clean water using a lot of water and rub with a clean towel. You must wash well the can or bucket to be used in milking. Never ever add water or anything to your milk. End of track.

Human evolution seems to have created a relatively new, more complex form of action control that corresponds to popular notions of free will. It is marked by self-control and rational choice, both of which are highly adaptive, especially for functioning within culture. The processes that create these forms of freewillmaybe biologically costly and therefore are only used occasionally, so that people are likely to remain only incompletely self-disciplined, virtuous, and rational.
