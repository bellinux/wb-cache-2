40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} builds on prior {{research}} that has examined the association between children’s chronic exposure to community noise and resting blood pressure and blood pressure dysregulation during exposure to acute stressors. A novel contribution {{of the study is}} that it examines how chronic noise exposure relates to blood pressure responses during exposure to both noise and non-noise acute stressors. The acute noise stressor was recorded street noise and the non-noise stressor was mental arithmetic. The sample consisted of 189 3 rd and 6 th grade children (51. 9 % percent boys; 52. 9 % 3 rd graders) from a noisy (n = 95) or relatively quiet (n = 94) public school in the city of Pune, India. There were no statistically significant differences between chronic noise levels and resting blood pressure levels. However, relative to quiet-school children, noisy-school children had significantly lower increases in blood pressure when exposed to either an acute noise or non-noise stressor. This finding suggests that chronic noise exposure may result in hypo-reactivity to a variety of stressors and not just <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> stressors...|$|E
40|$|The term "noise sensitivity" is {{frequently}} {{used in many}} areas of noise research. However, {{it can be used to}} describe several different effects and it can be measured in different ways. In noise surveys, noise sensitivity refers to the fact that individuals differ in the annoyance produced by different sources of noise. Noise sensitivity can be viewed as an independent variable, which may be directly related to outcomes such as health status, or it can be conceptualized as a factor that modifies or mediates the effects of noise exposure on the outcome measure. Noise sensitivity is highly correlated with the general trait negative affectivity, a measure of the extent to which individuals perceive or report negative features of their environment or self. Indeed, few studies have demonstrated effects of noise sensitivity that are independent of negative affectivity. This implies that it is most appropriate to examine general indicators of reported sensitivity rather than a noise-specific measure. Noise sensitivity can also be considered in terms of physiological reactivity to noise sources. Such effects are often only weakly associated with self-reports of noise sensitivity. <b>Habituation</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> is also an important topic to consider and again this appears to be largely independent of self-reported noise sensitivity. Overall, it would appear that it is important to distinguish between subjective reports of noise sensitivity and objective indicators. Different factors will modify these two aspects of noise sensitivity and this implies that different strategies are needed to influence them. Such effects must be taken into consideration when one considers whether control should be targeted at the community in general, or whether it should also cover the most sensitive individuals...|$|E
40|$|Context: Traffic <b>noise</b> is {{believed}} <b>to</b> cause road avoidance and other barrier effects {{in a variety}} of wildlife species, and to force changes to call pitch or loudness in others; however, this has never been tested in the absence of other road impacts. Noise impacts on species that do not frequently vocalise are also poorly understood. We investigated traffic-noise impacts on the following three rainforest mammals that do not often vocalise: Hypsiprymnodon moschatus, Uromys caudimaculatus and Perameles nasuta. These species have previously been observed to exhibit varying levels of road avoidance. Aims: To determine whether traffic noise affects movement and behaviour of medium-sized, ground-dwelling rainforest mammals in the absence of other road-associated variables and potential impacts. We hypothesised that noise impacts would be greatest for species previously shown <b>to</b> avoid roads. <b>Noise</b> impacts on these less vocal species compared with more vocal species is also discussed. Methods: In north-eastern Queensland, Australia, mammals captured at least 500 m from any road were tracked after fitting with spool-and-line equipment. On noisy nights, traffic noise at levels similar to a busy highway was played continuously throughout the night from a line of 12 speakers mounted on trees. Speakers were silent on quiet nights. Key results: Traffic noise caused no increase in avoidance of the speaker line and was not a barrier to movements across the line. Overall, movement paths on noisy nights appeared similar in pattern (tortuosity) to those of quiet nights. At a finer scale, movements of H. moschatus and P. nasuta became more tortuous later in the track, suggesting a return to normal foraging behaviour and possible <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> the <b>noise.</b> Conclusions: These three species with varying levels of previously recorded road avoidance, did not respond negatively <b>to</b> traffic <b>noise.</b> There was, however, a suggestion of habituation by H. moschatus and P. nasuta in response <b>to</b> the <b>noise.</b> Implications: The demonstrated lack of response <b>to</b> traffic <b>noise</b> in these less vocal species means that traffic <b>noise</b> is unlikely <b>to</b> cause road avoidance or barrier effects. Instead, lack of response and possible <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> traffic <b>noise</b> may increase vulnerability to road mortality...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} sensory areas {{may play a role in}} adaptation to repeated stress. The auditory cortex was the target of the present studies because it is a major projection area of the auditory thalamus, where functional inactivation disrupts stress <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> repeated loud <b>noise.</b> Large bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the auditory cortex were made in male rats 2 weeks prior to (Exp 1) or a few days after (Exp 2) a 5 day 30 min repeated 95 dBA noise or no noise regimen. Blood was collected immediately after exposure on days 1, 3, and 5. Two weeks after the 5 th exposure, the rats were retested with 30 min noise or no <b>noise</b> <b>to</b> determine retention of the habituated responses. Animals were killed immediately after the retest and trunk blood and brains collected for lesion verification. Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone levels were determined. In both experiments, significant between-subjects effects were found for noise (95 dBA or no noise) but not for surgery (lesion, sham, or no surgery control rats), with lesion groups exhibiting similar levels of ACTH and corticosterone across days as the sham and no surgery control groups. All noise exposed groups displayed similar habituation rates and retention levels. A third experiment indicated that similar auditory cortex lesions significantly disrupted background noise gap detection in an acoustic startle paradigm. Overall, these data suggest that the information mediating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> repeated loud <b>noise</b> exposures is not derived from the auditory cortex...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} prior exposure <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> reduces the effect of subsequent exposure due <b>to</b> <b>habituation.</b> Similarly, {{a number of studies have}} shown that exposure to Mozart′s music leads to better subsequent spatial reasoning performance. Two studies were conducted to extend these findings. The first one examined whether <b>habituation</b> occurs <b>to</b> office <b>noise</b> (including speech) and, if so, how long it takes to develop. Thirty-six young adults participated in the first study which compared effects of office noise with quiet on the performance of a maths task. The study also examined the effects of prior exposure <b>to</b> the office <b>noise</b> on the subsequent effect of the noise. The results showed that performance was initially impaired by the office noise but that the effects of the noise were removed by 10 minutes of exposure between tasks. The second experiment attempted to replicate the "Mozart effect" which represents an improvement in spatial reasoning following listening to Mozart. The study also examined whether the Mozart effect could be explained by changes in mood. Twenty-four young adults participated in the study. The results replicated the Mozart effect and showed that it was not due to changes in mood. Overall, these results show that prior exposure <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> or music can influence aspects of working memory. Such effects need to be incorporated into models of effects of noise on cognition and attempts have to be made to eliminate alternative explanations rather than just describing changes that occur in specific contexts...|$|R
40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} indicates that regular physical exercise benefits health in part by counteracting some of the negative physiological impacts of stress. While some studies identified reductions in some measures of acute stress responses with prior exercise, limited data were available concerning effects on cardiovascular function, and reported effects on HPA axis responses were largely inconsistent. Given that exposure to repeated or prolonged stress is strongly implicated in the precipitation and exacerbation of illness, we proposed the novel hypothesis that physical exercise might facilitate adaptation to repeated stress, and subsequently demonstrated significant enhancement of both HPA axis (glucocorticoid) and cardiovascular (tachycardia) response <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> repeated <b>noise</b> stress in rats with long-term access to running wheels compared to sedentary controls. Stress habituation {{has been attributed to}} modifications of brain circuits, but the specific sites of adaptation and the molecular changes driving its expression remain unclear. Here, in situ hybridization histochemistry was used to examine regulation of select stress-associated signaling systems in brain regions representing likely candidates to underlie exercise-enhanced stress habituation. Analyzed brains were collected from active (6 weeks of wheel running) and sedentary rats following control, acute, or repeated noise exposures that induced a significantly faster rate of glucocorticoid response habituation in active animals but preserved acute noise responsiveness. Nearly identical experimental manipulations also induce a faster rate of cardiovascular response habituation in exercised, repeatedly stressed rats. The observed regulation of the corticotropin-releasing factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor systems across several brain regions suggests widespread effects of voluntary exercise on central functions and related adaptations to stress across multiple response modalities...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of resilience in <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> heat and cold pain in healthy women (n = 47). Heat and cold pain thresholds were each assessed across 5 equally spaced trials. Re- silience, purpose in life, optimism, social support, and neuroticism were assessed using self-report measures. The hypothesis was that the resilience and the associated resilience factors would be pos- itively related <b>to</b> <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> heat and cold pain while controlling for neuroticism. Multilevel mod- eling {{was used to test}} the hypothesis. When considering each characteristic separately, resilience and purpose in life predicted greater <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> heat pain while resilience, purpose in life, optimism, and social support predicted greater <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> cold pain. When controlling for the other charac- teristics, both resilience and purpose in life predicted greater <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> heat and cold pain.

5000|$|Since most sound masking {{is used in}} offices, {{a number}} of {{cognitive}} psychology studies have been made that relate specifically to the office environment. One study {{found that there was}} a modest stress (physiological) increase and diminished motivation caused by typical office noises, including speech. It is recommended that the use of sound masking is {{under the control of the}} worker. Another study suggested that changes in level are an important factor, but that <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> the <b>noise</b> can occur. In the office, habituation can be interpreted to mean [...] "I’ve grown used <b>to</b> the <b>noise</b> and it no longer distracts me" [...] or [...] "Since I cannot do anything about it, I will have to live with it." [...] Another study point out that the specific information within the speech intrusion is not important nor is the [...] "intensity" [...] (level) of the sound between 48 and 76 dBA. Since the energy level of the louder sound was 1,000 times that of the least, one must assume that distraction occurred for all levels. For arithmetic tasks, both speech and non-verbal intrusive noises caused significant performance decreases. For [...] "prose tasks" [...] it was found that speech caused a greater performance decrease than nonverbal noises. In another study [...] the author added several significant observations. It was found that [...] "during a serial recall task, the accuracy of report decreases 30 to 50%." [...] When the intrusive speech was increasingly filtered to a meaningless mumble, there was a monotonic increase in performance. Finally, the author states: [...] "Perhaps the single feature that makes the irrelevant speech phenomena so fascinating is that the processing of sound is obligatory; it appears beyond the individual’s control." [...] Within the references cited above are further references to earlier works on this subject. There are several implications for a sound masking system. The masking must reduce the difference between the steady background level and the transient levels associated with both speech and other sounds. Motivation and productivity are improved when this is accomplished. The masking sound itself must not change rapidly and should be as meaningless as possible.|$|R

40|$|Sensory {{prediction}} error, {{which is}} the difference between actual and predicted sensory consequences, is a driving force of motor learning. Thus, appropriate temporal associations between the actual sensory feedback signals and motor commands for predicting sensory consequences are crucial for the brain to calculate the sensory prediction error accurately. Indeed, {{it has been shown that}} artificially introduced delays in visual feedback degrade motor learning. However, our previous study has showed that degraded adaptation is alleviated by prior <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> the delay. Here, we investigate how the motor learning system accomplishes this alleviation. After the subjects habituated reaching movements in either 0 -ms or 200 -ms-delayed cursor, visual rotation of 10 &# 176; was imposed to the cursor with varying delay (0, 100, 200, or 300 ms) with each delay imposed in at least 1 out of 5 - 6 trials. Then, the aftereffect in the next trial was quantified to evaluate the adaptation response. After <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> the 0 -ms delayed cursor, the adaptation response was maximal when the visual feedback of the perturbation was provided with 0 -ms delay and gradually decreased as the delay increased. On the other hand, <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> the 200 -ms delayed cursor alleviated the degraded adaptation response to the visual perturbation imposed during the 200 -ms and longer delay (300 -ms). However, habituation did not affect the adaptation response to the visual perturbation imposed during delays (0 - and 100 -ms delay) shorter than the habituated delay (200 -ms). These results may be explained by assuming that <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> the delayed feedback not only shifts the position of the hand predicted by motor command toward the delayed cursor positions, but also increases the degree to which the brain uses a certain amount of sensory prediction error to correct a motor command...|$|R
40|$|The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is an {{important}} stress-responsive system, but overactivity of the HPA axis can be detrimental to the physiological and psychological health of the organism. HPA activity habituates with repeated exposure to a homotypic stressor to limit these negative health consequences. HPA activation to habituating stressors occurs via limbic brain structures, though the exact mechanisms are unknown. One limbic structure, the basolateral amygdala (BLA), is well known as a mediator of learning and memory for aversive events. In particular, noradrenergic signaling via the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) in the BLA can bidirectionally modulate memory for an aversive experience. I hypothesized that similar mechanisms in the BLA may regulate HPA <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> a stressor. In this dissertation, I found that beta-AR manipulations in the BLA after daily restraint bidirectionally modified the strength of <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> restraint. Beta-AR blockade in the BLA prevented restraint-induced changes in gene expression in the hypothalamus and BLA. Beta-AR blockade also attenuated restraint-induced changes in intracellular signaling in the BLA, and these changes in signaling exert direct control of HPA activity to restraint. These findings 1) demonstrate the importance of beta-AR signaling in repeated restraint, 2) suggest that current models of beta-AR function in the BLA need to be revised, and 3) suggest that <b>habituation</b> <b>to</b> repeated stressors has important similarities and differences to models of aversive conditioning...|$|R

In contrast, neural responses in infants at high risk showed no habituation, and reduced sensitivity to changes in frequency.
