5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} which affects {{the functioning of the}} stomach and esophagus, also known as a functional <b>gastroduodenal</b> disorder. In patients that have a history of eating disorders, Rumination {{syndrome is}} grouped alongside eating disorders such as bulimia and pica, which are themselves grouped under non-psychotic mental disorder. In most healthy adolescents and adults who have no mental disability, Rumination syndrome is considered a motility disorder instead of an eating disorder, because the patients tend to have had no control over its occurrence and have had no history of eating disorders.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is diagnosed {{based on a}} complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as <b>gastroduodenal</b> manometry and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in misdiagnosis. Based on typical observed features, several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing rumination syndrome. The primary symptom, the regurgitation of recently ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least sixweeks of the past twelve months. The regurgitation must begin within 30minutes of {{the completion of a}} meal. Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it. The symptoms must stop within 90minutes, or when the regurgitated matter becomes acidic. The symptoms must not be the result of a mechanical obstruction, and should not respond to the standard treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal {{bleeding}} is {{the most}} common complication. Sudden large bleeding can be life-threatening. It occurs when the ulcer erodes one of the blood vessels, such as the <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery.|$|E
25|$|From {{its upper}} part, it joins {{to the neck}} of the {{pancreas}} at a well-marked prominence, the omental tuber, which abuts the lesser omentum. Its right edge is marked by a groove for the <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery.|$|E
25|$|ASCA+ is a {{predictor}} for Crohn's disease with high specificity and {{positive predictive value}} (87% and 78% respectively). ASCA are associated with proximal (<b>gastroduodenal</b> and small bowel involvement) rather than purely colonic disease (P < 0.001) and with a more severe disease phenotype and requirement for surgery over a median follow-up time of 9 years (P < 0.0001).|$|E
25|$|Helicobacter pylori colonizes the stomachs of {{more than}} half of the world's population, and the {{infection}} continues to play a key role in the pathogenesis of a number of <b>gastroduodenal</b> diseases. Colonization of the gastric mucosa with Helicobacter pylori results in the development of chronic gastritis in infected individuals, and in a subset of patients chronic gastritis progresses to complications (e.g., ulcer disease, stomach cancers, some distinct extragastric disorders). However, over 80 percent of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic and it has been postulated that it may play an important role in the natural stomach ecology.|$|E
25|$|Perforation (a hole in {{the wall}} of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract) often leads to catastrophic consequences if left untreated. Erosion of the gastro-intestinal wall by the ulcer leads to spillage of the stomach or intestinal content into the abdominal cavity. Perforation at the anterior surface of the stomach leads to acute peritonitis, initially chemical and later bacterial peritonitis. The first sign is often sudden intense abdominal pain; an example is Valentino's syndrome, named after the silent-film actor who experienced this pain before his death. Posterior wall perforation leads to bleeding due to the involvement of <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery that lies posterior to {{the first part of the}} duodenum.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis is very difficult, {{and usually}} one of exclusion. SMA {{syndrome}} is thus considered only after patients have undergone an extensive evaluation of their gastrointestinal tract including upper endoscopy, and evaluation for various malabsorptive, ulcerative and inflammatory instestinal conditions {{with a higher}} diagnostic frequency. Diagnosis may follow x-ray examination revealing duodenal dilation followed by abrupt constriction proximal to the overlying SMA, {{as well as a}} delay in transit of four to six hours through the <b>gastroduodenal</b> region. [...] Standard diagnostic exams include abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan with oral and IV contrast, upper gastrointestinal series (UGI), and, for equivocal cases, hypotonic duodenography. [...] In addition, vascular imaging studies such as ultrasound and contrast angiography may be used to indicate increased bloodflow velocity through the SMA or a narrowed SMA angle.|$|E
2500|$|Anatomically, the {{pancreas}} {{is divided into}} the head of pancreas, the neck of pancreas, the body of pancreas, and the tail of pancreas. The head is surrounded by the duodenum in its concavity. The head surrounds two blood vessels, the superior mesenteric artery and vein. From {{the back of the}} head emerges a small uncinate process which extends to the back of the superior mesenteric vein and ends at the superior mesenteric artery. The neck is about [...] long and lies between the head and the body and in front of the superior mesenteric artery and vein. Its front upper surface supports the pylorus (the base) of the stomach. The neck arises from the left upper part of the front of the head. It is directed first upward and forward, and then upward and to the left to join the body; it is somewhat flattened from above downward and backward. On the right it is grooved by the <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery. The body is the largest part of {{the pancreas}} and lies behind the pylorus, at the same level as the transpyloric plane. The tail ends by abutting the spleen.|$|E
5000|$|Cautions: severe {{cardiovascular}} disease, Raynaud's disease, <b>gastroduodenal</b> ulcers, active gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension.|$|E
50|$|The supraduodenal artery is {{an artery}} which usually {{branches}} from the <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery can be {{the source}} of a {{significant}} gastrointestinal bleed, which may arise as a complication of peptic ulcer disease.Because of its close relationship to the posteromedial wall of {{the second part of the}} duodenum, deeply penetrating ulcers or tumours of the duodenum may cause torrential bleeding from the <b>gastroduodenal</b> ‘artery of haemorrhage', not least because of the profuse arterial network in the region ensures a high flow rate in the vessel.|$|E
50|$|The thaumatin-like {{proteins}} {{isolated from}} kiwi fruit or apple {{appear to have}} their allergenic properties minimally reduced by <b>gastroduodenal</b> digestive processes, but not by heating.|$|E
50|$|These vessels anastomose {{with the}} {{pancreatic}} {{branches of the}} superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery that are given off by the <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery and superior mesenteric artery respectively.|$|E
50|$|Gastrointestinal {{bleeding}} is {{the most}} common complication. Sudden large bleeding can be life-threatening. It occurs when the ulcer erodes one of the blood vessels, such as the <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery.|$|E
50|$|Vonoprazan can be {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of <b>gastroduodenal</b> ulcer (including some drug-induced peptic ulcers) and reflux esophagitis, and can be combined with antibiotics for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori.|$|E

50|$|Oxapium iodide (ciclonium or cyclonium, {{trade name}} Oxaperan) is an {{antispasmodic}} indicated {{for the treatment}} of gastritis, <b>gastroduodenal</b> ulcer, enteritis, and other conditions. It is marketed in South Korea by Dongsung Pharmaceuticals.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The hepatogastric {{ligament}} is in {{this image}} labeled the lesser omentum, {{of which it is}} a part. The <b>gastroduodenal</b> ligament is a separate ligament, but also part of the lesser omentum.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom it is {{available}} in two strengths. It is marketed by Pharmacia and its indication is for prophylaxis against NSAID-induced <b>gastroduodenal</b> ulceration in patients requiring diclofenac for rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.|$|E
50|$|Rebamipide, an {{amino acid}} {{derivative}} of 2-(1H)-quinolinone, {{is used for}} mucosal protection, healing of <b>gastroduodenal</b> ulcers, and treatment of gastritis. It works by enhancing mucosal defense, scavenging free radicals, and temporarily activating genes encoding cyclooxygenase-2.|$|E
50|$|From {{its upper}} part it joins {{to the neck}} of the {{pancreas}} at a well-marked prominence, the omental tuber which abuts the lesser omentum. Its right edge is marked by a groove for the <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery.|$|E
50|$|Use of carbachol, {{as well as}} {{all other}} muscarinic {{receptor}} agonists, is contraindicated in patients with asthma, coronary insufficiency, <b>gastroduodenal</b> ulcers, and incontinence. The parasympathomimetic action of this drug will exacerbate the symptoms of these disorders.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a single}} cystic artery arises from <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery {{it forms a}} {{configuration}} is known as low-lying cystic artery, as it passes inferior to the cystic duct through the cholecystoduodenal ligament, and therefore remains outside the hepatobiliary triangle.|$|E
50|$|In summary, {{there is}} {{reasonable}} evidence (from larger studies) of a ‘weekend effect’ in UGIB (including bleeding <b>gastroduodenal</b> angiodysplasia) and paracentesis for cirrhosis and ascites; but little effect in AVH alone, and none in ERCP for cholangitis, or pancreatitis.|$|E
50|$|The minor {{duodenal}} papilla {{is contained}} within {{the second part of}} the duodenum. It is situated 2 cm proximal to the major duodenal papilla, and thus 5-8 cm from the opening of the pylorus. The <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery lies posterior.|$|E
50|$|Gastric volvulus {{of unknown}} cause {{comprises}} {{two thirds of}} cases and is presumably due to abnormal laxity of the gastrosplenic, <b>gastroduodenal,</b> gastrophrenic, and gastrohepatic ligaments. Type 1 gastric volvulus {{is more common in}} adults but has been reported in children.|$|E
50|$|In a {{peptic ulcer}} it is {{believed}} to be a result of edema and scarring of the ulcer, followed by healing and fibrosis, which leads to obstruction of the <b>gastroduodenal</b> junction (usually an ulcer {{in the first part of}} the duodenum).|$|E
50|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of stress}} ulcer is unclear but probably {{is related to}} a reduction in mucosal blood flow or a breakdown in other normal mucosal defense mechanisms in conjunction with the injurious effects of acid and pepsin on the <b>gastroduodenal</b> mucosa.|$|E
50|$|The {{duodenum}} receives {{arterial blood}} {{from two different}} sources. The transition between these sources is important as it demarcates the foregut from the midgut. Proximal to the 2nd part of the duodenum (approximately at the major duodenal papilla - where the bile duct enters) the arterial supply is from the <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery and its branch the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery. Distal to this point (the midgut) the arterial supply is from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and its branch the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery supplies the 3rd and 4th sections.The superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries (from the <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery and SMA respectively) form an anastomotic loop between the celiac trunk and the SMA; so there is potential for collateral circulation here.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{a branch}} of the <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery, which most {{commonly}} arises from the common hepatic artery of the celiac trunk, although there are numerous variations of the origin of the <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery [...] ). The pancreaticoduodenal artery divides into two branches as it descends, an anterior and posterior branch. These branches then travel around the head of the pancreas and duodenum, eventually joining with the anterior and posterior branches of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery. The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is {{a branch of}} the superior mesenteric artery. These arteries, together with the pancreatic branches of the splenic artery, form connections or anastomoses with one another, allowing blood to perfuse the pancreas and duodenum through multiple channels.|$|E
50|$|A {{considerable}} plexus {{accompanies the}} <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery and is continued as the inferior gastric plexus {{on the right}} gastroepiploic artery along the greater curvature of the stomach, where it unites with offshoots from the lienal plexus. Cystic plexus is the derivation of hepatic plexus.|$|E
50|$|In anatomy, the <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery {{is a small}} {{blood vessel}} in the abdomen. It {{supplies}} blood directly to the pylorus (distal part of the stomach) and proximal part of the duodenum, and indirectly to the pancreatic head (via the anterior and posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries).|$|E
50|$|The gastroepiploic arteries are arteries {{that supply}} oxygenated {{blood to the}} stomach. The right gastroepiploic artery arises when the <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery bifurcates. The left gastroepiploic artery arises from the splenic artery. The gastroepiploic arteries anastomose to one another on the greater {{curvature}} of the stomach.|$|E
50|$|NSAIDs {{have also}} been {{associated}} with gastrointestinal risks such as bleedings. Early studies demonstrated that naproxcinod had a better gastrointestinal profile than naproxen, especially for the <b>gastroduodenal</b> mucosa, but a 2009 review has found only a slight and possibly not clinically relevant reduction of gastrointestinal side-effects.|$|E
5000|$|... (b) subpyloric, {{four or five}} in number, {{in close}} {{relation}} to the bifurcation of the <b>gastroduodenal</b> artery, in the angle between the superior and descending parts of the duodenum; an outlying member of this group is sometimes found above the duodenum on the right gastric (pyloric) artery.|$|E
