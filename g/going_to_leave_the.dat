5|$|In the interrogation, McGarrett informs Sang Min {{that if he}} goes to prison, his Rwandan {{wife and}} son will be deported, leaving his son {{at the mercy of}} the Hutu militias. If he cooperates, McGarrett will ensure they stay in America. Sang Min reveals that Hesse is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> island on a Chinese freighter. Danny and McGarrett hastily drive to the docks. They then proceed to assault the freighter, where they {{dispatch}} several of Hesse's guards. McGarrett confronts Hesse, and shoots him off the boat. At the end of the episode, the new team settle into their new office space, and cannot settle on a name for their new unit.|$|E
25|$|Opening acts for {{the band}} {{included}} the bands Free, Taste and an R rock act called Delaney & Bonnie. Because Clapton liked the soulful, folksy-sounding blues of Delaney & Bonnie, he began spending {{most of his time}} with them instead of Blind Faith, letting Winwood take a more prominent role in the band. Clapton even began sitting in on their opening sets, sometimes simply playing percussion, and showing more interest in them than his own band. Baker has since said it was obvious that Clapton was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> band as soon as the tour was over.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 Miika Partala {{announced}} that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> band as did Janne-Jussi Kontoniemi. They decided to play the remaining gigs in Deuteronomium. During June 2000 they played three gigs in Germany. June 20 they played at Heavy und Biker club, Oelsnitz/Erzebirgen with death metal band Sacrificium. The black metal fans that showed up weren't pleased when they found out Deuteronomium is a Christian band. June 30 they played at club Che in Stuttgart with Sacrificium and Acoustic Torment. The third and last gig was played at the countryside of Gotha, Freakstock festival with speed/power metal band Seventh Avenue. That gig marked the end of Deuteronomium's active era.|$|E

25|$|The {{rift between}} Gordon and Sievers climaxed on 14 July 1721 when, at a banquet commemorating {{the battle of}} 'Hango Head,' a violent quarrel broke out {{between the two men}} in the {{presence}} of the Tsar. Gordon complained about the Dane’s behaviour towards him and pointed out that, as Seivers was responsible for the appointments of lieutenants and all inferiors, he was appointing the best officers and men to the Danish and Dutch commanders. The General-Admiral, Count Apraxin, did his best to justify the actions of Rear Admiral Sievers and maintained that Gordon had falsely accused him of partiality when dividing the officers and men. During his conversation he referred to Gordon as ‘your admiral’ to Peter the Great which was not well received. As Sievers was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> Tsar’s service at the end of the campaign, it was left like that. The next day Peter called the two admirals together and made them drink a glass of wine together hoping that this would end their bickering.|$|E

[...] On Bridget and the Parker's exit, Bower said [...] "It's the story that keeps on giving for another three or four weeks. It's very well storylined, beautifully acted and shot.

500|$|In December 1978, Genesis began {{a period}} of {{inactivity}} as Collins's marriage was at risk of collapse after touring had made him frequently absent from his wife and children. Following a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and Smith, Collins went to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to try and rebuild the family. He explained: [...] "I was never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> band. It was just that if I {{was going to be}} living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently." [...] Banks and Rutherford decided to put Genesis on an extended break and make their respective debut solo albums, A Curious Feeling and Smallcreep's Day, at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. In April 1979, Collins returned to the UK after his attempt to save his marriage failed. With time to spare before working on a new Genesis album, Collins performed with Brand X and started writing his first solo album, Face Value, at his home in Shalford, Surrey.|$|E

500|$|The group's touring {{schedule}} had put particular {{pressure on}} Collins, whose marriage was {{at risk of}} collapse due to him being away from home frequently. His wife, Andrea, had warned {{him that if he}} committed himself to the full ...And Then There Were Three... Tour, she would not be there when he returned. Collins, however, was convinced that Genesis {{were on the verge of}} an international breakthrough and that his work with the band would pay dividends in the future. By the end of 1978, Andrea had decided to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with their children. Realising that his marriage was more important than the band, Collins held a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and manager Tony Smith. He said he was moving to Vancouver and try and re-build the family, and that the group would have to accommodate this. In an interview for Sounds, Collins said, [...] "I went off for two months to try and sort things out ... I was never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> band. It was just that if I was going to be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently."

2500|$|From the 1940s until 1970, {{the paper}} was run by Hector Legge (1901–1994).

2500|$|In 1992 Crawford {{gave the}} [...] "Dragon Speech" [...] where he {{explained}} that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> game industry to make something more interactive and artistic.

Both systems were used to make highly complex interactive storylines, and as a demo, Crawford used Storytron to build a new game, Balance of Power: 21st Century. This version begins on 12 September 2001 and mostly involves the US's interactions with Asia and other emerging powers. It was not a success; Crawford himself describes it as [...] "crap".|$|E

2500|$|In the 2000–01 season, United {{retained}} the league title {{for a third}} season, becoming only the fourth side in history to do so. The achievement was overshadowed by reports of a rift between the club's board and Ferguson. He told the club's television channel MUTV that {{he was prepared to}} sever all ties with the club, once his contract ended the following year: [...] "The decision has been taken. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> club. I'm disappointed with what has happened because I was hoping something would be sorted out. It hasn't happened as I thought it would and that's all there is to it." [...] Both parties eventually reached a compromise which pleased Ferguson: [...] "I am delighted we've settled this. When you have been at the club as long as I have it gets in your blood." [...] Ferguson's decision to retire came about because he perceived his chances of winning a second European Cup as [...] "imponderable." [...] Age was another factor: reaching 60 acted as a [...] "psychological barrier ... It changed my sense of my own fitness, my health." ...|$|E

[...] May was quick to admit that her remarks at the annual press gallery dinner in Gatineau, Que., were a poor attempt at comedy. However, she said they shouldn't detract from her political track record. [...] President of the Treasury Board Tony Clement and NDP House Leader Peter Julian said Monday afternoon that May's apology was sufficient. [...] "Look, she's apologized which was appropriate and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> matter at that," [...] Clement told reporters. Laura Peck, senior partner at TransformLeaders.ca, said, [...] "She has apologized. She's done the right thing, she's apologized," [...] Peck said.

2500|$|A teenage female Black Knight later {{appears in}} the Vengeance limited series {{as a member of}} the Young Masters. Like Garrett, this {{incarnation}} is a villain, and appears to possess the Ebony Blade. How she came into possession of the sword and what happened to Augustine has yet to be revealed.

Later targeting Doctor Octopus for [...] "execution", the Young Masters found themselves battling the Sinister Six while being assisted by/battling the Teen Brigade, with Black Knight being assisted in taking down Sandman by Teen Brigade member Ultimate Nullifier. While a visiting a nightclub, Black Knight encountered Ultimate Nullifier at the time when the Young Masters plotted to recruit a reborn Loki to their side.

At about 6:15a.m. on October 8, 2004, she reported to FPC Alderson. Stewart said that her prison nickname was [...] "M. Diddy". While in confinement, she took a job and became an informal liaison between the administration and her fellow inmates. The People special, Scandals! That Rocked America, stated [...] "Some expected America's goddess of domestic perfection to fall into terminal despair.

She was then placed in a two-year term of supervised release; during five of those months, she was placed in home confinement with electronic monitoring. Stewart served her home confinement at her residence in Bedford, New York. She was allowed to leave her house for 48 hours per week for work-related visits.
