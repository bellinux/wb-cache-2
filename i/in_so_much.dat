While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced.

Thousands of pro-slavery Border Ruffians came across from Missouri to vote in the territorial elections although they were not resident in Kansas, giving that element the victory. Pierce supported the outcome despite the irregularities. When Free-Staters set up a shadow government, and drafted the Topeka Constitution, Pierce called their work an act of rebellion. The president continued to recognize the pro-slavery legislature, which was dominated by Democrats, even after a Congressional investigative committee found its election to have been illegitimate. He dispatched federal troops to break up a meeting of the Topeka government.|$|E

She fell out of formation, but later rejoined the fleet outside the Schillig roadstead. Upon reaching Wilhelmshaven, Grosser Kurfürst went into harbor while several other battleships took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead. The ship was transferred to Hamburg where she was repaired in AG Vulcan's large floating dock. Repair work was completed by 16 July. In the course of the battle, Grosser Kurfürst fired a total of 135 shells from her main battery and 216 rounds from her 15cm guns. She was hit by eight large-caliber shells, which killed fifteen men and wounded ten.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the reasons}} this bat is <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> danger is its slow {{reproduction}} rate. The Eastern small-footed bat usually has only one offspring a year, although a few instances of twins have been noted. Mating most often occurs in autumn and the female stores the male’s sperm throughout hibernation in the winter. Fertilization occurs in the spring once the females are active again, and gestation occurs between 50–60 days with young being born in late May and early June. Mating has also been noted to occur throughout the hibernation period if individuals awake. [...] During the time of breeding large number of bats {{come together in a}} behavior commonly known as “swarming.” All bats of this species are polyandrous, meaning they mate with multiple partners throughout the mating period. This mating behavior allows them to increase the likelihood of copulation, and therefore increase their reproductive success.|$|E

However, Justice Tan Lee Meng held that the plaintiffs, who were merely temple devotees, did not have the required locus standi to institute the proceedings, as opposed to the trustees of the temple who were its legal owners. He relied on the Court of Appeal's judgment in Karaha Bodas Co. LLC v. Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd. (2005), which stated that [...] "to have the necessary standing, the plaintiff must be asserting the recognition of a 'right' that is personal to him". The Court also referred to Lord Diplock's judgment in Gouriet v. Union of Post Office Workers (1977) where he held that the courts should only be concerned with rights <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as they are legal rights which are enforceable by one party against another.|$|E

And in the end, she's such a survivor." [...] To aid her method acting, she developed a complete backstory for Shaw, and worked with a dialect coach to achieve a British accent. She also asked her make-up artist to apply extra blood and sweat during filming to more accurately portray her character. Rapace said, [...] "I was out there filming for about six months and it was super-intense, my body was <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> pain sometimes but it was absolutely amazing." [...] She dismissed comparisons to the Alien franchise's Ellen Ripley. Rapace came to director Ridley Scott's attention for her performance as Lisbeth Salander in the 2009 drama film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. She met Scott in August 2010, and by January 2011 she had secured the role. Actresses Anne Hathaway, Natalie Portman, Gemma Arterton, Carey Mulligan, and Abbie Cornish were all considered for the role during development. Lucy Hutchinson, who was eight years old in 2012, portrays Shaw as a child.|$|E
500|$|Within {{hours of}} Toivonen's crash, Jean-Marie Balestre and the FISA decided to ban Group B cars from {{competing}} in the 1987 season. The planned Group S was also cancelled and manufacturers were stuck with cars they could not race. Audi and Ford withdrew from Group B racing immediately, but other teams competed {{until the end of}} the season. The Tour de Corse continued the next day and Bruno Saby won with his Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 E2. Prior to Santos' and Toivonen's crashes, many commentators and drivers had warned of accidents resulting from drivers simply being unable to control their powerful cars. FISA was criticised for recognising the problem too late. A FISA investigation later proved that drivers' reactions were too slow to keep up with the speed of the Group B cars, and drivers' eyes could not adjust their focus between the fast corners, resulting in tunnel vision. However, due to the high speed of the cars, rallying was more popular among spectators than ever. FISA had to face criticism also for overreacting to Toivonen's accident. John Davenport, author and former rally co-driver, stated in 2004 that [...] "Group B could have been tamed. They were only unsafe <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as the fuel system, which caused Toivonen's death, and the crowd control needed changing– it wasn't the actual cars."
