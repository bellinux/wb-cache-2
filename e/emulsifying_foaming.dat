To that end, BSG protein concentrate (BPC), prepared by alkaline extraction of BSG and subsequent acid precipitation, was enzymatically hydrolyzed with Alcalase during both 1. 7 and 120 min. Because these hydrolysates contained many different peptides, fractionation of the hydrolysates with graded ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation was performed to obtain fractions homogeneous in terms of molecular weight (MW) and hydrophobicity. The <b>emulsifying</b> and <b>foaming</b> capacities of the resultant fractions were determined. MW distributions and surface hydrophobicities of fractions with protein contents exceeding 75 % were investigated to determine relationships between technofunctional and physicochemical properties. It was found that the <b>emulsifying</b> and <b>foaming</b> properties are determined by different physicochemical properties of the proteins or peptides. Neither MW nor hydrophobicity alone determines the <b>emulsifying</b> and <b>foaming</b> properties of protein hydrolysates. BSG protein hydrolysates with good emulsifying properties contained less than 40 % of fragments with MW exceeding 14500. Moreover, these hydrolysates had a high surface hydrophobicity.

From our study, we found that protein extracted from press cake proteins had a solubility of about 90 % above pH 9. Emulsifying properties of press cake protein were comparable to sodium caseinates and reached the highest value at pH 9 – 10. Jatropha proteins formed films with tensile strength of 0. 4 – 1. 8 MPa with 10 – 75 % elongation, which were below soy protein or wheat-gluten.

40|$|Abstract: Canola {{protein isolate}} has been {{suggested}} {{as an alternative to}} other proteins for human food use due to a balanced amino acid profile and potential functional properties such as <b>emulsifying,</b> <b>foaming,</b> and gelling abilities. This is, therefore, a review of the studies on the utilization of canola protein in human food, comprising the extraction processes for protein isolates and fractions, the molecular character of the extracted proteins, as well as their food functional properties. A majority of studies were based on proteins extracted from the meal using alkaline solution, presumably due to its high nitrogen yield, followed by those utilizing salt extraction combined with ultrafiltration. Characteristics of canola and its predecessor rapeseed protein fractions such as nitrogen yield, molecular weight profile, isoelectric point, solubility, and thermal properties have been reported and were found to be largely related to the extraction methods. However, very little research has been carried out on the hydrophobicity and structure profiles of the protein extracts that are highly relevant to a proper understanding of food functional properties. Alkaline extracts were generally not very suitable as functional ingredients and contradictory results about many of the measured properties of canola proteins, especially their emulsification tendencies, have also been documented. Further research into improved extraction methods is recommended, as is a more systematic approach to the measurement of desired food functional properties for valid comparison between studies...|$|E

Pea protein isolates were hydrolyzed for either 15, 30 and 60 min with recombined chymosin (Maxiren). The effect of enzymatic action on solubility, <b>emulsifying</b> and <b>foaming</b> properties at different pH values (3. 0; 5. 0; 7. 0 and 8. 0) was monitored. Chymosin can be a very useful agent for improvement of functional properties of isolates. Action of this enzyme caused a low degree of hydrolysis (3. 9 – 4. 7 %), but improved significantly functional properties of pea protein isolates (PPI), especially at lower pH values (3. 0 – 5. 0).

Seven hydrolysate fractions (5. 04 ≤ AMW ≤ 47. 82 kDa) from collagen of Spanish mackerel skin were obtained through the processes of acid extraction, proteolysis, and fractionation using gel filtration chromatography. The physicochemical properties of the collagen hydrolysate fractions were studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), gel filtration chromatography, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).

Egg, either as a whole or its constituents (egg yolk and white), is a key ingredient in many food products {{by virtue of its}} nutritional value and unique functional properties, such as <b>emulsifying,</b> <b>foaming,</b> and gelling. Nevertheless, egg is also known because of its allergenic potential and, in fact, it is the second most frequent source of allergic reactions, particularly in children. This review deals with the structural or functional properties of egg proteins that make them strong allergens. Their ability to sensitize and/or elicit allergic reactions is linked to their resistance to gastroduodenal digestion, which ultimately allows them to interact with the intestinal mucosa where absorption occurs. The factors that affect protein digestibility, whether increasing it, decreasing it, or inducing a different proteolysis pattern, and their influence on their capacity to induce or trigger an allergic reaction are discussed.

Most of the previous work on WPC has been directed at enzymatic hydrolysis. Dispersions of WPC (8 %) in organic acids (0. 5 N, 1 N and 1. 5 N acetic acid, citric acid phosphoric acid and mixture of these acids) were subjected to acid hydrolysis (6, 18 and 48 h) and the effects of this modification on functional properties was assessed.

Highest foam capacity was found in the hydrolysate obtained using 0. 5 N acetic acid (6 h hydrolysis, foaming capacity of 140 %); acid hydrolysis increased foam stability, in general. In addition, acid hydrolysis did not affect emulsifying activity index but gave higher emulsifying stability index and toughness of prepared gels.

These whey proteins are commonly used in powder form obtained by a spray-drying process.

This study concerned four whey protein powders obtained using spray-drying at four different air inlet temperatures (from 170 to 260 degrees C), leading to different levels of protein solubility, denaturation and end-use properties. After evaluation of the protein denaturation by HPLC, the emulsifying properties were studied through particle size parameters and rheological properties in relation with spray-drying parameters. Our results indicated that oil-in-water emulsions, stabilized by 5 % (w/w) protein samples, exhibited a shear-thinning flow behaviour, and the harsher the spray-drying conditions (the higher the protein denaturation), the less viscous were the emulsions. The apparent viscosity of emulsions measured at 20 degrees C and 50 s(- 1) shear rate was around 0. 08 Pa s when containing whey proteins before drying, and around 0. 05 - 0. 018 Pa s after drying at air inlet temperatures from 170 to 260 degrees C.

From a previous study [1] on a fermented food product (Swiss-type cheese) for which one typical functionality criterion was measured (stretchability) and peptides were identified, we developed a methodology based on multivariate exploratory analysis such as Principal Component Analysis and Correspondence Analysis to establish a relationship between peptide characteristics and their technofunctional property. This method allowed us to determine that peptides predominantly involved in the stretchability of the cheese were amphiphilic and contained more than 15 amino-acids. It will be then possible to target enzymes able to produce peptides with chosen characteristics. This method can be applied to other types of peptides and other food technofunctionalities in other food matrices...|$|E
40|$|Food {{products}} are complex matrices. They contain molecules from several families that {{interact with each}} other to generate specific structures and functionalities. These molecules may include proteins and peptides resulting from protein hydrolysis, e. g. in cheese. It is still difficult to establish a clear relationship between a pool of peptides and their techno-functionalities such as <b>emulsifying,</b> <b>foaming,</b> gelling or even texture properties within a complex matrix. Among the data usually known, there is the degree of hydrolysis that provides information about the average size of the peptides formed. A high degree of hydrolysis induces the production of a pool of small-size peptides (less than 20 amino acids). Advances in identification methods have made the identification of peptides present in food products possible. The size, charge, hydropathy index and isoelectric point of the peptide, as well as its secondary structure, can be calculated {{on the basis of the}} peptide sequence. The aim of this study was to determine which physicochemical and structural characteristics of peptides are involved in the cheese stretchability. This work is a re-evaluation, using multivariate exploratory analysis, of the experimental data obtained from a former study (Sadat-Mekmene et al., 2013) in which one typical functionality criterion of Swiss-type cheese (stretchability) was measured and peptides were identified. This methodology, based on Principal Component Analysis and Correspondence Analysis, is one way to establish a relationship between peptide characteristics and their techno-functional property within a complex dairy matrix. This statistical approach showed that the peptides predominantly involved in cheese stretchability were a mixture of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides and that they are large enough to {{interact with each other}} and with native proteins. This approach could be applied to better understand the impact of peptides on various food matrices and food techno-functionalities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{functional}} properties of corn steeping water protein concentrated (CSWPC) were investigated, and compared with soybean protein isolated (SPI). The {{results showed that}} the emulsifying capacity and viscosity of CSWPC were slightly lower than that of SPI, but the <b>emulsifying</b> stability, <b>foaming</b> property, foaming stability, gelatinization and oil absorption of CSWPC were better than that of SPI. The CSWPC showed better emulsifying capacity and stability at protein concentration of 1 - 3 %, NaCl concentration of 0. 15 - 0. 3 mol/L under alkali environment. The gelatinization of CSWPC got better with the increase of concentration of CSWPC. The foaming property was increased with the increase of sucrose concentration, but the foaming stability was decreased with the increase of sucrose concentration. The oil absorption capacity was increased slightly with the increase of temperature...|$|R
40|$|This review {{presents}} the advances made concerning {{the ability of}} peptides to bestow particular functionalproperties on various matrices including foods. We focus on systems ranging from model solutionsin which peptides are rationally designed to orient their structure and to form hydrogels to mixtures ofpeptides in complex food matrices. In the latter case, peptides {{are an integral part}} of food formulationsdue to their production in situ or their addition as an ingredient. Examples of complex matrices such asfood products, where mixes of peptides are present as hydrolysates with various physico-chemicalproperties, focus on the ability of peptides to modulate the texture of foods and their functional properties,including solubility, gelation and even <b>emulsifying</b> and <b>foaming</b> properties. Attempts have beenmade to establish relationships between the physico-chemical and structural characteristics of peptidesand their functional properties...|$|R
40|$|Pearl millet {{cultivar}} (Dempy) was {{supplemented with}} soybean flour to raise the protein content by 5 %, 10 % and 15 %. Defatted soybean flour, pearl millet flour and their composite flour had varying functional properties. Water and fat absorption, bulk density, nitrogen solubility and dispersibility were higher for soybean flour {{compared to that of}} pearl millet flour. Therefore, such properties were improved significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) for pearl millet with increasing the level of soybean supplementation. The <b>emulsifying</b> and <b>foaming</b> properties of pearl millet flour were poor but after supplementation with soybean they significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) improved. Supplementation of pearl millet flour with soybean had no effect on least gelation concentration of millet. The implication of these results will be realized in designing protein-enriched products based on pearl millet flour, especially for pearl millet–growing regions in the under-developing countries...|$|R
