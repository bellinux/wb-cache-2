5000|$|The {{difficulty}} level can be set, {{the race}} track selected {{and the number}} of laps is variable. The field includes ready made and custom made cars (the player can select engine, tires, suspension). Avoiding the slower cars the player come up to lap can be crucial. During a race, you can bump into other cars and into the side boards and other obstacles. <b>This</b> will damage <b>your</b> <b>car.</b> In every track, there is a pit lane (labeled with the letters [...] "PIT") where you can fuel up and repair <b>your</b> <b>car.</b> Top speed will decrease if the engine <b>is</b> damaged. <b>This</b> will make you lose time in every lap. When you are in the PIT STOP you can hold down the DOWN key to speed up car repairs. Fuel intake will be slower, though. The fuel consumption is determined by the RPM meter (as in real <b>cars).</b> <b>Your</b> <b>car</b> only consumes fuel when you accelerate. F1 tracks cannot be won at the first race unless you are an ace driver. To win an F1 race, try to memorize each curve and play each race several times to know where to brake and where to accelerate.|$|R
