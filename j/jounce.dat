25|$|The 1998 model {{had a few}} minor {{refinement}} {{changes to}} the brakes, suspension, steering and emissions controls. A new front control arm design with front hydraulic bushing and rear cross axis ball joint for enhanced ride smoothness and better isolation from road noise and vibration. Internal rebound springs added to front struts for improved body motion control and to minimize crash-through. Increased wheel travel (3mm) and redesigned <b>jounce</b> bumpers for softer feel at full travel. Dual durometer cradle mounts for improved isolation. Premium valving and damping {{in the front and}} rear struts for a higher refinement in calibration. There were more accurate wheel sensors for improved ABS actuation. New steering calibration for more on-center feel and reduced parking effort.|$|E
500|$|If [...] {{represents}} {{the position of}} an object at time , then the higher-order derivatives of [...] have physical interpretations. [...] The second derivative of [...] is the derivative of , the velocity, and by definition this is the object's acceleration. The third derivative of [...] is defined to be the jerk, and the fourth derivative is defined to be the <b>jounce.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Look {{out that}} you don't <b>jounce</b> off when you go over a bump," [...] cried Dunston Porter to Phil and Belle, who sat {{at the back of}} the turnout.|$|E
6000|$|... "In this vest-pocket. It {{must have}} <b>jounced</b> {{out during the}} hard riding. Oh, what luck! Captain, I'll {{have to go back}} and look for my property." ...|$|R
60|$|He shoved {{back the}} clasps {{and threw the}} case open. The {{contents}} were much jumbled, but he had expected this {{from the fact that}} the bag had been <b>jounced</b> out of the carriage.|$|R
60|$|But {{the horse}} did not stop. Instead, {{he began to}} back, and then {{of a sudden he}} leaped high up in the air, to come down on all fours with a thump that nearly <b>jounced</b> poor Hans to pieces.|$|R
60|$|Just {{then came}} a narrow turn, with a down grade, very uneven and full of rocks. Over the latter bumped the carriage. Then came a sudden <b>jounce,</b> {{followed}} by a crash.|$|E
60|$|The farm-houses became fewer as they proceeded, and {{the path}} was at times so faint that the Sawhorse had hard work to keep in the road. The wagon began to <b>jounce,</b> too; so they were obliged to go slowly.|$|E
60|$|With care, they {{advanced}} on {{the trail}} of those ahead. This was a rather difficult task, for the lantern had been put out, and it was pitch-dark tinder the trees. More than once their steeds went into a hollow with a <b>jounce</b> that threatened to throw one or another to the ground.|$|E
6000|$|She {{checked the}} pony before the bar which the flagman at the {{railroad}} crossing had let down, while a long freight train clattered deafeningly by, and then drove bumping and <b>jouncing</b> across the tracks. [...] "I suppose {{you remember what}} 'Over the Track' means in Hatboro'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mike lets me {{ride the}} white one to water {{when the judge}} isn't round. It's such fun to go <b>jouncing</b> down the lane and back. I do love horses!" [...] cried Bab, bobbing {{up and down on}} the blue bench to imitate the motion of white Jenny.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the camp}} {{by the lake}} the Supervisor became sharply commanding. [...] "Now let's throw these packs on lively. It will be {{slippery}} on the high trail, and you'll just naturally have to hit leather hard and keep <b>jouncing</b> if you reach the wagon-road before dark. But you'll make it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] {{said the}} Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe men, {{discussing}} life later, [...] "we weren't runnin' for a record. Harvey Cheyne's wife, she were sick back, an' we didn't want to <b>jounce</b> her. 'Come {{to think of}} it, our runnin' time from San Diego to Chicago was 57.54. You can tell that to them Eastern way-trains. When we're tryin' for a record, we'll let you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I could jest kick {{my little}} sawed-off self," [...] said Poney, as [...] .007 was backed, with a bang, on to a grim and grimy car like a caboose, but full of tools--a flatcar and a derrick behind it. [...] "Some folks are one thing, {{and some are}} another; but you're in luck, kid. They push a wrecking-car. Now, don't get rattled. Your wheel-base will keep you on the track, and there ain't any curves worth mentionin'. Oh, say! Comanche told me there's one section o' sawedged track that's liable to <b>jounce</b> ye a little. Fifteen an' a half out, after the grade at Jackson's crossin'. You'll know it by a {{farmhouse}} an' a windmill an' five maples in the dooryard. Windmill's west o' the maples. An' there's an eighty-foot iron bridge in the middle o' that section with no guard-rails. See you later. Luck!" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{one week}} Una heard Walter Babson make {{approximately}} the same assertions to three different men, and to whoever in the open office might care to listen and profit thereby. Then, apparently, he ceased to hear the call of literature, and he snorted at S. Herbert Ross's stodgy assistant {{that he was a}} wage-slave, and a fool not to form a clerks' union. In a week or two he was literary again. He dashed down to the office-manager, poked a sheet of copy-paper at him, and yelped: [...] "Say, Nat. Read that and tell me just what you think of it. I'm going to put some literary flavor into the Gas-bag even if it does explode it. Look--see. I've taken a boost for the Kells Karburetor--rotten lying boost it is, too--and turned it into this running verse, read it like prose, pleasant and easy to digest, especially beneficial to children and S. Herbert Souse, Sherbert Souse, I mean." [...] He rapidly read an amazing lyric beginning, [...] "Motorists, you hadn't better monkey with the carburetor, all the racers, all the swells, have equipped their cars with Kells. We are privileged to announce what will give the trade a <b>jounce,</b> that the floats have been improved like all motorists would have loved." ...|$|E
6000|$|This Guide in frowzy coat of brown, [...] And beard {{of ancient}} growth and mould, Bestrode a bony steed and strong, As suited well with bulk he bore-- [...] A wheezy man with {{depth of hold}} [...] Who <b>jouncing</b> went. A staff he swung-- [...] A wight whom Mosby's wasp had stung.|$|R
60|$|While {{they were}} eating breakfast, teams began to clatter by, huge lumber wagons with three seats across, and a boy or two <b>jouncing</b> {{up and down with}} the dinner baskets near the end-gate. The {{children}} rushed to the window each time to announce who it was, and how many there were in.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a time}} of peril, and all of the Rover boys {{realized}} this fully. The buckboard was a strong one, but the road had been washed out so much by the storm that it was very uneven, and the <b>jouncing</b> threatened each moment to land one lad or another out on his head.|$|R
5000|$|The rate {{of change}} of jerk, the fourth {{derivative}} of displacement is known as <b>jounce.</b> The SI unit of <b>jounce</b> is [...] which can be pronounced as metres per quartic second.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Jounce</b> and {{the fifth}} and sixth {{derivatives}} of position {{as a function of}} time are [...] "sometimes somewhat facetiously" [...] referred to as snap, crackle, and pop respectively. However, derivatives of higher order than <b>jounce</b> are not useful and there is no consensus among physicists on names for them.|$|E
50|$|Double {{wishbone}} suspension provides the engineer more free parameters {{than some other}} types do. It is fairly easy {{to work out the}} effect of moving each joint, so the kinematics of the suspension can be tuned easily and wheel motion can be optimized. It is also easy to work out the loads that different parts will be subjected to which allows more optimised lightweight parts to be designed. They also provide increasing negative camber gain all the way to full <b>jounce</b> travel, unlike the MacPherson strut, which provides negative camber gain only at the beginning of <b>jounce</b> travel and then reverses into positive camber gain at high <b>jounce</b> amounts.|$|E
60|$|There {{was no time}} to say more, for the {{automobile}} was <b>jouncing</b> over the stones in too lively a manner. Alarmed, Dick, who had already shut off the power, applied the brake, but he was not used to this and he jammed it fast so it did not altogether prevent the car from advancing.|$|R
60|$|The wagon road {{wound around}} in the forest, and was in {{anything}} but good repair, so that poor Sam was <b>jounced</b> about until he felt sore all over. He did not dare to speak, and, truth to tell, {{he did not know}} what to say. He realized that if he asked what was to become of his brothers, nobody would tell him.|$|R
60|$|It did {{not take}} the three lads long to find the six {{suitcases}}, and, armed with two each and with all the guns, they trudged back to where they had left the boxsled. Then the suitcases were piled up and tied fast to the upright boards and to the boxsled itself, so that they might not be <b>jounced</b> off. The guns were placed in the bottom alongside the boxes.|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{derivative}} of position, {{equivalent to the}} first {{derivative of}} jerk, is <b>jounce.</b>|$|E

50|$|Independent suspension: The arms have {{to control}} camber, {{particularly}} {{the way that}} the camber changes as the wheel moves up (into <b>jounce,</b> or bump) and down into rebound or droop.|$|E
60|$|The {{result was}} as {{might have been}} expected. The dudish pupil had been resting {{on the end of}} the board, which {{overlapped}} the chair, and with the weight of the others removed, the board suddenly tipped upward and down went William Philander in a heap, the chicken salad <b>jouncing</b> forward over his shirt front and the glass of grape juice in his hand being dashed full into his face.|$|R
60|$|Dave paid no {{attention}} to the cries. He had all he could do to keep from falling under the animal. Away went boy and mule, over the rough rocks in a fashion which nearly <b>jounced</b> the breath from the rider's body. Then, just as they came close to some low-hanging trees where Dave felt certain he would be hurt, the mule turned again, leaped for the shore, and sped out on the ice of the river.|$|R
6000|$|In {{those days}} {{people did not}} [...] "call," [...] they went [...] "visitin'." [...] The women took their {{knitting}} and stayed all the afternoon and sometimes all night. No one owned a carriage. Each family journeyed in a heavy farm wagon with the father and mother riding high on the wooden spring seat while the children <b>jounced</b> {{up and down on}} the hay in the bottom of the box or clung desperately to the side-boards to keep from being jolted out. In such wise we started on our trip to the McClintocks'.|$|R
5000|$|Snap, crackle, and pop are terms [...] "facetiously" [...] {{used for}} the fourth, fifth and sixth time {{derivatives}} of position. The fourth derivative of position is more formally known as <b>jounce.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{dimensions}} of <b>jounce</b> are distance per fourth power of time. In SI units, this is [...] "metres per {{second to the}} fourth", m/s4, m⋅s−4, or 100 gal per second squared in CGS units.|$|E
5000|$|In physics, <b>jounce</b> is {{the fourth}} {{derivative}} of the position vector with respect to time, or {{the rate of change}} of the jerk with respect to time. Equivalently, it is second derivative of acceleration or the third derivative of velocity.Jounce is defined by any of the following equivalent expressions: ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{took him}} by the shirt collar {{with his left hand}} and began to cuff him leisurely and terribly with his right. His blows punctuated his sentences. [...] "You're a little [whack] villain. I'll thrash you till you won't see out of your blasted eyes for a month! I can't stand a man [here he <b>jounced</b> him up and down with his left hand, {{apparently}} with infinite satisfaction] who bullies his wife and children as you do [here he cuffed him again], and I'll make it my business to even things up----" ...|$|R
60|$|Many of {{the young}} fellows had hired at ruinous expense the {{carriages}} in which they sat with their girls, wearing a quiet air of aristocratic reserve which did {{not allow them to}} shout sarcasms at Milton, when his horse broke into a trot and <b>jounced</b> him up and down till his hat flew off. But mainly the young people were in huge bowered lumber wagons in wildly hilarious groups. The girls in their simple white dresses tied with blue ribbon at the waist, and the boys in their thick woolen suits which did all-round duty for best wear.|$|R
60|$|They met swiftly dashing sleighs, and {{let them}} pass on either hand, down the {{beautiful}} avenue narrowing with an admirably even sky-line in the perspective. They were not in a hurry. The mare <b>jounced</b> easily along, and they talked of the different houses {{on either side of}} the way. They had a crude taste in architecture, and they admired the worst. There were women's faces at many of the handsome windows, and once in a while a young man on the pavement caught his hat suddenly from his head, and bowed in response to some salutation from within.|$|R
