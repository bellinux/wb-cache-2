25|$|These light utility {{vehicles}} were available with three engines: a Vortec 7.4-liter V8, a 5.7-liter V8, or Detroit Diesel 6.5 L V8. Each engine was {{coupled with a}} 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission. All CUCV IIs have full-time all-wheel drive; a <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch</b> was available as an option.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Restored CCKW 353 Cargo {{truck with}} open cab, machine gun ring, and <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch</b> ...|$|E
50|$|BTR-152B (1952) - Artillery command {{version with}} a <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch</b> and {{external}} tires pressure regulation system.|$|E
50|$|Some were {{fitted with}} 10000 lb <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winches.</b> A winch added 300 lb and 14 in.|$|R
2500|$|Prime movers had a [...] winch {{behind the}} cab, most other trucks had a <b>front-mounted</b> two-drum <b>winch</b> for self-recovery. Trucks {{converted}} from prime mover chassis had no winch at all.|$|R
25|$|The MKR15 {{recovery}} variant {{is able to}} flat tow a 110,000 pound (49895kg) vehicle, is able to {{lift and}} tow a 96,000-pound (43545kg) vehicle, is equipped with rear-mounted winches with a 78,000 pound (35380kg) combined straight-pull rating, and a <b>front-mounted</b> self-recovery <b>winch</b> with a 20,000-pound (9072kg) straight-pull rating.|$|R
50|$|The M931 (M932 w/winch) was a semi-tractor used to tow {{semi-trailers}} up to 37,500 lb. A <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch</b> was optional.|$|E
50|$|A {{wide range}} of {{optional}} equipment can be fitted to the vehicle including a <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch,</b> heater/air-conditioning system, and various weapon systems.|$|E
50|$|BTR-152B1 (1958) - Artillery command {{version with}} a <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch,</b> {{internal}} tire pressure regulation system and ТВН-2 night vision device for the driver.|$|E
50|$|The {{expedition}} vehicles had the 86.0 in (2184 mm) steel wheelbase, produced between 1954 and 1956, and {{the larger}} 2.0 litre I4 unit engine, which had replaced the 1.6 litre version in 1952. Slight modifications to the two vehicles taken on the expedition included {{the addition of a}} front-mounted jerry can {{on either side of the}} grille, a spotlight on each vehicle, an additional 100-gallon petrol tank in the rear of each vehicle, and <b>front-mounted</b> engine-driven <b>winches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At {{its most}} basic a winch {{challenge}} vehicle will be a CCV-spec machine with a <b>front-mounted</b> recovery <b>winch.</b> However, a distinct breed of vehicles adapted for Winch Challenges has evolved. The small, open-topped CCV vehicles are not well suited to carrying the often large range of equipment needed for winch recovery in difficult terrain. A larger vehicle with some form of protection from the elements is desired (the short-wheelbase Land Rover Defender, especially in [...] "Hard Top" [...] guise, is a typical and common basis for a Winch Challenge vehicle).|$|R
50|$|The mount can be traversed 180° {{left and}} right and the 7.62 mm machine gun can be {{elevated}} from -20° to +70°. There are 230 rounds of ready-use ammunition, and an additional 3,000 rounds carried inside the vehicle. The firing is electronically controlled with safety locking and braking together with a mechanical backup. There is also a last round indicator. The day sight has a wide field of view (22°) with 1x magnification and a collimated aiming circle, and a narrow field of view (8°) with 8x magnification and a ballistic graticule. The night sight has a wide field of view (22°) with 1x magnification and collimated aiming circle, and a narrow field of view (7°) with 7x magnification, a 25 mm image intensifier tube, and a ballistic graticule. Standard equipment includes an air conditioning system, a heater and defogger, an infrared driving headlamp, a blackout lighting system, a smoke extraction fan mounted on the roof, thick polyurethane roof and body interior lining for thermal and noise insulation, an explosion-suppressed fuel tank, and Hutchinson run-flat tires. Optional equipment includes a <b>front-mounted</b> electrical <b>winch</b> with 25 meters of cable at a capacity of 3,600 kg, 66 mm smoke grenade launchers, a pioneer kit (axe, shovel, pickaxe), a communications system, and a land navigation system.|$|R
50|$|BTR-152V (1955) - Variant {{based on}} ZIL-157 truck with {{external}} tires pressure regulation system, a <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch</b> and night vision devices for the driver.|$|E
50|$|The M813 was the {{standard}} cargo {{version of the}} series. It had a 14 ft long low sided box with a bottom hinged tailgate. Side racks, troop seats, and overhead bows with a tarpaulin were standard. A <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch</b> was optional.|$|E
50|$|The M54 was the {{standard}} cargo {{version of the}} series. It had a 7 ft × 14 ft low-sided box with a bottom-hinged tailgate. Side racks, troop seats, and overhead bows with a canvas cover were standard. A <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch</b> was optional.|$|E
50|$|These light utility {{vehicles}} were available with three engines: a Vortec 7.4-liter V8, a 5.7-liter V8, or Detroit Diesel 6.5 L V8. Each engine was {{coupled with a}} 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission. All CUCV IIs have full-time all-wheel drive; a <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch</b> was available as an option.|$|E
50|$|The M291 had a 17 ft van {{body with}} a {{slide-out}} section on each side. When the sections are extended the working floor was over 12 ft wide. The body could support 5,000 lb of communications equipment. The M291A1D had a rear power lift gate. None had a <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most models had a rear {{limited slip}} {{differential}} and some variants had a vacuum or electric solenoid operated manual rear differential lock. A rear sway bar release mechanism appeared on some models. Some Y60s had a PTO-driven <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch,</b> with an in-cab control lever {{to the right of}} the gearstick.|$|E
50|$|The GAZ-66 {{has gained}} legendary status in many {{countries}} around the world due to its reliability, simplicity and off-road capability. Thanks to standard features, such as a <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch,</b> Central Tire Inflation System (CTIS) and self-locking differentials, the GAZ-66 is extremely popular worldwide with armed forces and off-road enthusiasts. Production ceased in 1999, with the GAZ-3308 being produced instead.|$|E
5000|$|TAB-71 (TAB {{stands for}} transportor amfibiu blindat - [...] "amphibious armored carrier") - Romanian license -produced variant of BTR-60PB fitted {{with two more}} {{powerful}} SR-225 gasoline engines developing 140 hp (104 kW) each instead of the old GAZ-40Ps. It is equipped with additional periscopes, a protected sight {{on the left side}} of the turret and a <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch</b> with a capacity of 5.5 tonnes.|$|E
50|$|The M820 had a 17 ft long van {{body with}} a slide out section on each side. When the {{sections}} are extended the working floor was almost 14 ft wide. The body could support 5,000 lb of communications equipment. Heaters and air-conditioners (except the M820A1) were housed above the cab. The M820A1 had no windows or air-conditioning, the M820A3 and M820A4 had a hydraulic rear lift gate. None had a <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Diamond-T 969A 4-ton, 6x6 Wrecker was {{powered by}} the 6 cylinder, 529 cu. in. Hercules RXC engine that {{developed}} 106 hp. mated to a five-speed manual transmission and two-speed transfer case. It was equipped with the Holmes W-45 heavy-duty military wrecker bed with its twin boom and two 5-ton winches {{at the front of}} the bed as well as a <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch.</b> A variety of other recovery equipment was carried, along with its own air compressor.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 219,882 -ton (2,268 kg) 6x6 trucks and similar 5-ton (4,536 kg) 6x4 {{versions}} in thirteen variations were built. Studebaker {{was the primary}} manufacturer, which built 197,678 of them at their South Bend IN plant, while REO produced 22,204 more at their Chicago IL plant from 1944 under a sub-contract. REO trucks are identical to Studebakers, but REO only built cargo-model trucks with the long wheelbase and without the <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch,</b> more specifically {{referred to as the}} US6 U9. All production by both manufacturers ended in 1945.|$|E
50|$|Each {{of these}} {{had to be}} pre-emptively checked and tested by the {{expedition}} members before any crossings were attempted, and, frequently, the vehicles had to chance it and ford the rivers. At {{one point in the}} journey, crossing the Brahmaputra river in India, it did become necessary for the Cambridge vehicle to pull the Oxford vehicle to safety using the vehicle's <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch.</b> In Northern Thailand there was also a stretch of 100 miles where no proper road had ever been constructed, and the expedition had to cut its way through the jungle.|$|E
50|$|The AFKWX (A for 1939, F for forward cab, K for all wheel drive, and W for tandem rear axles) 353, a {{cab over engine}} {{cargo bed}} version of the CCKW, went into {{production}} alongside it in 1942 at Yellow’s Pontiac plant and Chevrolet’s in St. Louis. Otherwise mechanically identical, its compact cabin design allowed a 15 ft, and later 17 ft cargo bed to be fitted. The first 50 produced had closed cabs, all others were open. The cab over design made engine maintenance difficult. As a result, only 7235 were built, none with a <b>front-mounted</b> <b>winch.</b>|$|E
