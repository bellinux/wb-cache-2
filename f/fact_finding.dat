5|$|During {{the early}} {{half of the}} Song dynasty (960–1279), the study of {{archaeology}} developed out of the antiquarian interests of the educated gentry and their desire to revive the use of ancient vessels in state rituals and ceremonies. This {{and the belief that}} ancient vessels were products of 'sages' and not common people was criticized by Shen Kuo, who discussed metallurgy, optics, astronomy, geometry, and ancient music measures in addition to archeology. His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze. In accordance with the beliefs of the later Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), some Song gentry —such as Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129)— valued archaeological evidence over historical works written after the <b>fact,</b> <b>finding</b> written records unreliable when they failed to match with the archaeological discoveries. Hong Mai (1123–1202) used ancient Han dynasty era vessels to debunk what he found to be fallacious descriptions of Han vessels in the Bogutu archaeological catalogue compiled during the latter half of Huizong's reign (1100–1125).|$|E

40|$|Federal Rule of Evidence 803 (8) (C), an {{exception}} to the rule against admission of hearsay, permits introduction of public records or reports containing the <b>fact</b> <b>findings</b> of the reporter without requiring the reporter to appear at trial. These <b>fact</b> <b>findings</b> can be based upon the reporter 2 ̆ 7 s own observations and calculations or information imparted to the reporter from sources having no connection to any public agency whatsoever. Rule 803 (8) (C) has also been used as the vehicle for presenting juries with <b>fact</b> <b>findings</b> from hearings conducted by public officials. The rule would seem to allow these <b>fact</b> <b>findings</b> even though the opponent had no opportunity to challenge either the finding or any of the witnesses whose testimony led to it. This Article contends that admitting many of the <b>fact</b> <b>findings</b> discussed above without demonstrable need or strong assurances of their reliability undercuts the bases for the hearsay rules and can result in jury consideration of highly prejudicial evidence. In Beech Aircraft Corporation v. Rainey, the Supreme Court interpreted the 2 ̆ 7 factual findings 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 provision of 803 (8) (C) broadly to include 2 ̆ 7 conclusions 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 opinions 2 ̆ 7 of the investigator. While the decision in Beech Aircraft is sensible in its recognition of the difficulty in distinguishing 2 ̆ 7 factual findings 2 ̆ 7 from 2 ̆ 7 opinions 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 conclusions 2 ̆ 7, it will result in an expansion of the type of hearsay-based evidence that will be admitted under Rule 803 (8) (C). Where a hearsay exception expands both the allowable sources of hearsay information and the type of hearsay-based evidence admitted, extreme care should be taken to ensure that questionably reliable or prejudicial evidence is not submitted to a jury without the opportunity to test the evidence through cross-examination. Rule 803 (8) (C) was not drafted nor has it been generally applied with such caution. First, this Article explores some of the problems encountered by courts in applying Rule 803 (8) (C) and explains some of the unfairness that can result if it is not applied carefully. Second, it describes the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s Beech Aircraft decision allowing opinions and conclusions into evidence under Rule 803 (8) (C). Third, the Article describes a suggested reading of Rule 803 (8) (C) in conjunction with the rules on expert witnesses that should help courts determine which opinions and conclusions should be admissible. Finally, the Article offers additional suggestions to insure the fair application of Rule 803 (8) (C) ...|$|R

However, this was later refuted by several people who attended the meeting, including prominent human rights lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution and Joint <b>Fact</b> <b>Finding</b> Team member Bambang Widjojanto. Further testimonies by Prabowo in the years following the investigation contradicted the team's report and led to scepticism of the team's allegations. When Suharto resigned his mandate on 21 May, both Prabowo and Wiranto were bypassed in favour of a constitutional power transfer to Vice-President Habibie. Prabowo was transferred to a non-active position on the following day before being discharged from service in August. He and Wiranto denied that the discharge was a result of disciplinary action.|$|E
