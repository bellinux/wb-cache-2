40|$|Vision {{evolved from}} the vital {{necessity}} {{to act in a}} dynamic environment. Following this view it is clear that perceptual processes and action planning are much more interlocked than is evident at first sight. This is especially evident in visual space perception; actions are performed in space and are guided and controlled by objects in spatial positions. Here we shortly introduce the three research camps dealing with the relationship between space perception and action: the <b>ecological</b> <b>camp,</b> the two-visual-systems camp, and the constructivist camp. We show that these camps emphasize and open different theoretical and empirical perspectives, but that they can be seen to complement each other. We end with an overview of the papers in this special issue...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: scientifically {{substantiate}} {{and develop}} a program of classes using ecological tourism for primary school age children, aimed at the formation of ecological culture of schoolchildren. Material & Methods: pedagogical experiment {{was carried out in}} the form of ascertaining (191 schoolchildren: 96 boys, 95 girls) and formative (50 schoolchildren). The level of ecological culture of schoolchildren was assessed by the method of A. V. Asafova. The assessment of the level of physical health was carried out according to the method of G. L. Apanasenko. Results: model of ecological culture of schoolchildren of primary school age is theoretically grounded and developed, which includes the following components: axiological, motivational, activity, cognitive, and the basic criteria and levels of its formation in schoolchildren. The low level of ecological culture of schoolchildren is revealed. It is established that effective forms of ecological tourism are the ecological lesson, the ecological path, the ecological game, the ecological trip of the day off, the ecological excursion, the <b>ecological</b> <b>camp.</b> These funds were used to build a program of physical preparedness. Conclusion: positive influence of the developed program of ecological tourism on the indicators of physical condition, formation of ecological culture, organization of useful leisure and active recreation of children of primary school age...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was carried out between 36 Km stretch of River Ganga from Rishikesh to Kaudiyala in Uttrakhand state of India to {{understand}} the ecological impacts of river rafting and camping on the adjoining forests and economic growth within the area. This article has largely relied on field survey for vegetation analysis, wildlife survey, structured questionnaire for economic survey and secondary data collected from different government departments. It {{is interesting to note}} that number of camping and rafting agencies have increased from 27 in 2004 to 105 in 2008 - 09 and number of tourist have also increased from 17063 in 2004 to 76368 in 2009 - 10. Findings indicate some negative ecological impacts of river rafting and camping and the positive impact on local economy. Negative ecological impacts include damage to nearby forests and disturbance to wildlife, while improvements in local economy has come through income generation and employment opportunities to local people Key words: River rafting <b>Camping</b> <b>Ecological</b> impacts Econom...|$|R
40|$|The {{social and}} <b>ecological</b> impacts of <b>camping</b> were {{examined}} in Warren National Park, Western Australia. The main objective was to apply an integrated approach to assessing campsite degradation and feed this information into a management and monitoring strategy for campsites in the park. Biophysical data were used to establish a campsite profile, providing baseline information that enabled comparison of heavy-use formal campsites with low-use informal campsites. High-use formal campsites were more severely impacted than the low-use, informal campsites. Formal sites were also larger, had experienced more tree damage and erosion, had greater soil compaction, less vegetation cover and tree seedlings, less coarse woody debris, higher riverbank degradation and more walk trails radiating from the campsite. Additionally, the low-use, informal sites had also been degraded by recreation use. Potential indicators were identified, using a social survey that enabled identification of the standards of social and resource conditions in the Warren National Park. Desired conditions were then compared to existing conditions at the campsites and relevant managerial preferences acceptable to visitors were identified in the social survey. Most of the management preferences were considered very or extremely important influences {{on the quality of}} the visitor experience...|$|R
