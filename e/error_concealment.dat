40|$|International audienceThe {{transmission}} of 3 DTV sequences over packet based networks {{may result in}} degradations of the video quality due to packet loss. In the conventional 2 D case, several different strategies are known for extrapolating the missing information and thus concealing the error. In 3 D however, the residual <b>error</b> after <b>concealment</b> of one view might leads to binocular rivalry with the correctly received second view. In this paper, three simple alternatives are presented: frame freezing, a reduced playback speed, and displaying only a single view for both eyes, thus effectively switching to 2 D presentation. In a subjective experiment the performance in terms of quality of experience of the three methods is evaluated for different packet loss scenarios. Error-free encoded videos at different bit rates have been included as anchor conditions. The subjective experiment method contains special precautions for measuring the Quality of Experience (QoE) for 3 D content and also contains an indicator for visual discomfort.

30|$|Video quality-related {{features}} {{and measures of}} artifacts can be computed both from the pixel and bitstream data and can be pooled for an overall quality estimate. One such method which focuses on quantifying the perceptual quality of H. 264 /AVC encoded videos degraded by loss of packets in the IP networks is presented in[179]. The error incurred due to packet loss becomes propagative due to {{the two types of}} coding predictions involved in H. 264 /AVC encoders, namely, intra-prediction (spatial) and inter-prediction (temporal) at the encoder end. Even more errors can be introduced while the decoder tries to conceal for the prediction residuals and/or motion vectors lost due to missing packets in the IP bitstream. For simulating the packet loss conditions, a packet loss rate in the range [0.1, 20]% with error patterns generated using a two-state Gilbert model set for average burst length of three packets was used. Quantitatively, the measures involved in the modeling of the proposed method encompass the impact of <b>errors</b> due to <b>concealment,</b> <b>errors</b> propagated due to loss of reference MBs, and the channel-induced degradation due to H. 264 /AVC-specific coding techniques. The calculations of these distortions are done on the macroblock level, and the resulting values are summed up to frame and sequence levels. It has been observed that the proposed method yields results which bear good correlation with SSIM[94]. Another method was presented by the same authors in their earlier published contribution[180] where the effects of loss of motion vector information and prediction residuals were incorporated for quality estimation. A method in which transmission and compression artifacts are integrated for VQA is presented in[181]. The constituents of the method are estimations of blockiness, blurring, and packet loss ratio.|$|R
