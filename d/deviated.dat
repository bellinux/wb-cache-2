40|$|This {{research}} examines whether {{evaluations of}} positive <b>deviates</b> (i. e. high achieving group members) {{are influenced by}} the attributions they make for their performance. We argue that ingroup positive <b>deviates</b> who make group attributions help enhance the ingroup 2 ̆ 7 s image and thus attract favorable evaluations. In Experiment 1, ingroup positive <b>deviates</b> who made group attributions were generally evaluated more favorably than ingroup positive <b>deviates</b> who made individual attributions. There was also evidence that the positive <b>deviates</b> 2 ̆ 7 attribution style influenced group and self-evaluations. Evaluations of outgroup positive <b>deviates</b> were not influenced by their attribution style. In Experiment 2, an ingroup positive <b>deviate</b> who was successful and attributed that success to the group was upgraded relative to an ingroup positive <b>deviate</b> who made individual attributions. Group evaluations were also higher when the positive <b>deviate</b> made group attributions. This pattern did not emerge when the positive <b>deviate</b> failed.

40|$|The Reticulitermes flavipes <b>deviate</b> gene was {{investigated}} {{to determine its}} role in termites 2 ̆ 7 response to environmental changes, {{as well as its}} effect on important termite behaviors such as trail following and foraging. ^ The <b>deviate</b> gene was expressed in all four termite body regions that were sampled (antennae, head, thorax, and abdomen), and the gene was also present in the three phenotypes sampled (worker, solder, and nymph). ^ To examine the effect of photoperiod on <b>deviate</b> expression, termites were held in either light, dark, or light/dark cycle conditions. These differences in light conditions resulted in altered <b>deviate</b> expression between light and dark treatments, suggesting a possible connection between the <b>deviate</b> gene and termite circadian rhythm. ^ Temperature did not appear to alter <b>deviate</b> expression across the range tested (17 °C– 27 °C), however when juvenile hormone was added to identical temperature treatments, a difference in gene expression was observed between 17 °C and 22 °C. This information may suggest that the <b>deviate</b> gene is suppressed by juvenile hormone, and that <b>deviate</b> {{may play a role in}} the processes associated with caste maintenance and differentiation in termites. Additionally, when RNA-interference (RNAi) was used to silence <b>deviate</b> gene expression, <b>deviate</b> silenced worker termites held in dishes containing a food source treated with juvenile hormone III did not show significant differences from controls in the number presoldiers that developed or the timing of presoldier development. These findings may further support the hypothesis that <b>deviate</b> expression in termites decreases as juvenile hormone increases. ^ Finally, RNAi gene silencing was used to examine the behavioral role of the <b>deviate</b> gene. First a time-course for the RNAi silencing process was developed using quantitative real-time PCR.

Fortunately, DuPont engineer George Graves had <b>deviated</b> from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added an additional 504 tubes to fill in the corners.

5|$|Action T4 was a {{programme}} {{of systematic}} {{murder of the}} physically and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that mainly took place from 1939 to 1941 and continued {{until the end of}} the war. Initially the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen and others; in addition gas chambers and gas vans using carbon monoxide were used by early 1940. Under the provisions of a law promulgated 14 July 1933, the Nazi regime carried out the compulsory sterilisation of over 400,000 individuals labelled as having hereditary defects. More than half the people sterilised were those considered mentally deficient, which included not only people who scored poorly on intelligence tests, but those who <b>deviated</b> from expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift, sexual behaviour and cleanliness.

5|$|Hurricane Elena was an {{unpredictable}} and damaging tropical cyclone that affected {{eastern and central}} portions of the United States Gulf Coast in late August and early September 1985. Threatening popular tourist destinations during Labor Day weekend, Elena repeatedly <b>deviated</b> from its forecast path, triggering evacuations of unprecedented extent. The hurricane wrought havoc to property and the environment between southwestern Florida and eastern Louisiana, though lesser effects were felt well beyond those areas. Elena developed on August 28 near Cuba, and after traveling lengthwise across the island with little impact, it entered the Gulf of Mexico and continued to strengthen. Initially projected to strike the central Gulf Coast, the hurricane unexpectedly veered toward the east on August 30, then stalled just 50mi (80km) west of Cedar Key, Florida. Despite predictions that Elena would continue eastward across Florida, the cyclone remained nearly stationary for about 48 hours, causing damage all along the eastern gulf with high winds and waves, before slowly moving northwest and ultimately making landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi, on September 2 as a Category 3 major hurricane. The storm quickly weakened upon moving ashore and dissipated on September 4.|$|E

The Soviet Air Force treated the unidentified aircraft as an intruding U.S. spy plane, and proceeded to destroy it with air-to-air missiles, after firing warning shots which were likely not seen by the KAL pilots. The Korean airliner eventually crashed in the sea near Moneron Island west of Sakhalin in the Sea of Japan. All 269 passengers and crew aboard were killed, including Larry McDonald, a Representative from Georgia in the United States House of Representatives.
