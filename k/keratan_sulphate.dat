50|$|Osteoadherin, Fibromodulin and PRELP are core {{proteins}} {{found in}} bone and cartilage, that are modified by N-linked KS chains. Osteoadherin and Fibromodulin linked KS chains are shorter than {{those found in}} the cornea, typically 8-9 disaccharide units in length. Whereas corneal KSI is composed of a number of domains showing variable degrees of sulphation the longest of which may be 8-32 disaccharide units in length. The non-reducing terminal of Fibromodulin KS is more similar in structure to the non-reducing terminal of a KSII type <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> rather than to corneal KSI. KS structure is therefore believed to be determined by the tissue specific availability of glycosyltransferases rather than linkage type to the core protein.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} cells, the major non-aqueous {{constituents}} of the stroma are collagen fibrils and proteoglycans. The collagen fibrils {{are made of}} a mixture of type I and type V collagens. These molecules are tilted by about 15 degrees to the fibril axis, and because of this, the axial periodicity of the fibrils is reduced to 65 nm (in tendons, the periodicity is 67 nm). The diameter of the fibrils is remarkably uniform and varies from species to species. In humans, it is about 31 nm. Proteoglycans are made of a small protein core to which one or more glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are attached. The GAG chains are negatively charged. In corneas we can find {{two different types of}} proteoglycans: Chondroitin sulphate/dermatan sulphate (CD/DS) and <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> (KS). In bovine corneas, the length of the CS/DS proteoglycans is about 70 nm, while the KS proteoglycans are about 40 nm long. Proteoglycan protein cores attach {{to the surface of the}} collagen fibrils with the GAG chains projecting outwards. The GAG chains are able to form antiparallel links with other GAG chains from adjacent fibrils, perhaps through the mediation of positively charged ions. In such a way, bridges are formed between adjacent collagen fibrils. These bridges are subject to thermal motion which prevents them from assuming a fully extended conformation. This results in forces that tend to move adjacent fibrils close to each other. At the same time the charges on the GAG chains attract ions and water molecules by the Donnan effect. The increased water volume between the fibrils results in forces that tend to push the fibrils apart. A balance between attractive and repulsive forces is reached for specific inter-fibrillar distances, which depends on the type of proteoglycans present. Locally, the separations between adjacent collagen fibrils are very uniform.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of extracellular matrix molecules (chondroitin and <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphates,</b> type II collagen) {{is described in}} cranial connective tissues of teleosts. Hyaline cartilage {{was similar to that}} in mammals and usually contained all 3 molecules. The more cellular cartilages that are not normally present in mammals were more variable in composition. Scleral cartilage closely resembled hyaline cartilage, Zellknorpel in the gill filaments resembled it in some species but not in others, and elastic/cell-rich and hyaline-cell cartilages were unlike hyaline cartilage. These variations may be related to functional or developmental differences between the tissues. Bone and chondroid bone also varied in composition between species. Whilst both tissues contained chondroitin sulphate, bone contained type II collagen in 5 of the 12 species examined. This suggests that cartilage components are more widespread in teleost bone than has previously been shown. Type II collagen also occurred in dense connective tissues of some species. Notably, where this molecule was present in one of these tissues, it was present in all...|$|R
40|$|The suprascapular {{ligament}} converts the {{suprascapular notch}} into a foramen separating the vessels and nerve {{of the same}} name. It connects 2 regions of the same bone and does not cross any joint, and no mechanical function has yet been attributed to it. Nevertheless, variations in its thickness and length, and its tendency to ossify, suggest that the ligament responds to changes in mechanical load. This should {{be reflected in the}} composition of the extracellular matrix. The primary {{purpose of the present study}} is to demonstrate that the suprascapular ligament has fibrocartilaginous entheses (i. e. insertion sites), even though there is no obvious change in insertional angle that directly results from joint movement. Such a change is more typical of tendons or ligaments that cross highly mobile joints. The complete ligament (including both entheses) was removed from 7 cadavers shortly after death and fixed in 90 % methanol. Cryosections were immunolabelled with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against collagens (types I, II, III, VI), glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin 4 sulphate, chondroitin 6 sulphate, dermatan <b>sulphate</b> and <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphates),</b> proteoglycans (aggrecan and versican) and link protein. Both entheses were strongly fibrocartilaginous, and a moderately fibrocartilaginous matrix was also detected throughout the remainder of the ligament. The extracellular matrix of both entheses labelled strongly for type II collagen, aggrecan and link protein. The fibrocartilaginous character of the entheses suggests that the insertion sites of the ligament are subject to both compressive and tensile loading and are regions of stress concentration. This in turn probably reflects the complex shape of the scapula and the presence of a conspicuous indentation (the suprascapular notch) near the ligament. The loading patterns may reflect either the attachment of muscles and/or the forces transmitted to the suprascapular ligament from the neighbouring coracoclavicular ligament...|$|R
40|$|Hyaluronan (HA), chondroitin and <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphates</b> (CS, KS), {{collagen}} and dry weights {{were measured}} in the annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus of human cervical, thoracic and lumbar intervertebral discs aged 36 - 79 y. Alcian blue-critical electrolyte concentration (CEC) staining of sections extended the results. The collagen, total polyanion, HA, CS and KS contents of the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus were plotted for all 3 regions against age. Regional differences and age-related trends were found. For regional differences, the collagen content of the nucleus pulposus was highest in cervical discs and lowest in lumbar discs. In contrast, the total polyanion content of the nucleus pulposus was highest in lumbar discs and lowest in cervical discs. These differences were seen in fetal and adult discs. With respect to age-related trends, the collagen content of the annulus fibrosus was higher in adults and children than in neonates and infants. The collagen content of the nucleus pulposus increased with age in thoracic and lumbar discs, but it was consistently high in cervical discs. There was generally a downward trend of total polyanion and CS with increase in age. This was quite consistent for the annulus fibrosus in all regions and there were dramatic decreases in the lumbar nucleus pulposus in all adults compared with infants and children. These trends were least evident in the cervical nucleus pulposus where infant values were low. CS changes correlated with water content. HA and KS increased in all discs with increasing maturity. Oversulphated KS, absent from fetal discs, reached mature levels by 10 y. Many of the changes occurred before maturity. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels correlated with increasing compressive loads. Higher collagen levels in the cervical nucleus pulposus correlated with greater ranges of torsional and shearing strains in cervical discs. High GAG levels in cervical annulus fibrosus probably facilitate lamellar movements during torsional and flexional movements by lubrication and increase of tissue compressibility. Increased KS/CS ratios before maturity correlated with decreased disc blood supply. Ambient O 2 tensions may determine KS/CS balance, the former consuming little O 2 during biosynthesis...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. A {{study was}} made of the {{distribution}} of <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> in the human anterior chamber. Methods. The monoclonal antibody, 5 -D- 4, was used in immuno-electron microscopy to visualise <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> distribution in the anterior chamber of 16 normal eyes, 7 Fuchs' dystrophy corneas, and a macular dystrophy cornea. Results. <b>Keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> was detected in normal human aqueous humour and also on the surface of trabecular cells in the uveal meshwork. Normal corneal stroma showed an increase in <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> labelling from anterior to posterior, with marked labelling in the posterior region of Descemet's membrane. The apical surface of the corneal endothelium labelled positively, but showed considerable variation in the level of labelling from cell to cell. The macular dystrophy cornea had the classic histopathological features of a type I case, including a highly abnormal Descemet's membrane. No <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> was detected in the macular dystrophy patient's corneal stroma or serum. The Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy corneas showed a normal distribution of <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> labelling in the stroma. The Fuchs' endothelial cells labelled for <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> but were highly abnormal in appearance, often exhibiting long filopodia and appearing to be actively migrating. Conclusions. This work has shown that <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> has a much wider distribution than was previously believed. The detection of <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> on the trabecular and endothelial cell surfaces also suggests a possible role for this molecule in cell adhesion and/or migration...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{regulating the}} secretion of proteoglycans and collagens in chondrocytes, in particular those operating {{at the level}} of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), are largely unknown. To examine these mechanisms, I studied the effects of acute ascorbate treatment on the secretion of two collagen types (types II and IX) and two proteoglycan types (PG-H and PG-Lb, the major <b>keratan</b> sulphate/chondroitin <b>sulphate</b> proteoglycan and the minor chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan respectively in cartilage) in scorbutic cultures of chick vertebral chondrocytes. I found that the scorbutic chondrocytes synthesized underhydroxylated precursors of types II and IX collagen that were secreted very slowly and accumulated in the RER. When the cultures were treated acutely with ascorbate, both macromolecules underwent hydroxylation within 1 - 1. 5 h of treatment, and began to be secreted at normal high rates starting at about 2 h. Proteoglycan synthesis and secretion, however, remained largely unaffected by ascorbate treatment. Both the half-time of newly synthesized PG-H core protein in the RER and its conversion into completed proteoglycan were unchanged during treatment. Similarly, the overall rates of synthesis and secretion of both PG-H and PG-Lb remained at control levels during treatment. The data indicate that secretion of types II and IX collagen is regulated independently of secretion of PG-H and PG-Lb. This may be mediated by the ability of the RER of the chondrocyte to discriminate between procollagens and proteoglycan core proteins...|$|R
40|$|Various {{materials}} {{are used in}} modern dental and maxillofacial surgery for bone tissue substitution and reconstruction. All osteoplastic materials {{can be divided into}} four groups by origin: autogenic, allogenic, xenogenic and synthetic. Synthetic resorbable materials were intended as an inexpensive substitute for natural bone. Synthetic graft materials include various types of ceramics: tricalcium phosphate; bioglass; hydroxyapatite and its compositions with collagen, sulphated glycosaminoglycans such as <b>keratan</b> and chrondroitin <b>sulphates</b> well as with sulphate and calcium phosphate. Jaw deformities from tooth removal can be prevented and repaired by a procedure called socket preservation. The procedure begins with atraumatic tooth extraction. Every attempt is made to preserve the surrounding bone and soft tissue, with an emphasis on being careful not to fracture the delicate buccal plate. There are a number of techniques and instruments that aid in this process. In general, one never wants to elevate so that force is directed toward the buccal plate. It is important that good bleeding is established in the socket. Next, a bone graft material is placed into the socket and covered with a resorbable or non-resorbable membrane and sutured. Most importantly, socket preservation helps to maintain the alveolar architecture and significantly reduces the loss of ridge width and height following tooth removal...|$|R
40|$|Connective tissue {{function}} {{is defined as}} the formation and maintenance of shape, without which centralised physiologies (circulatory, digestive or nervous) could not have evolved. Two elements, inextensible (collagenous) fibrils and compression-resistant interfibrillar soluble polymers (proteoglycans), cope with all usual stresses. Relationships between the two are highly specific, as demonstrated by electron histochemistry based on Cupromeronic blue and critical electrolyte concentration (CEC) methodologies. Recent ideas on (1) the protofibrillar or modular structure of collagen fibrils, (2) the nature of specific binding sites for proteoglycans on fibrils, and (3) fundamental similarities in secondary and tertiary structures of the glycosaminoglycans (hyaluronan, chondroitin, <b>keratan</b> and dermatan <b>sulphates)</b> are described. They have greatly illuminated the study of extracellular matrix structure and function in normal, pathological (osteogenesis imperfecta) and ageing tissues. The small proteoglycans are proposed to be tissue organisers, orienting and ordering the collagen fibrils [...] thus shaping the tissue at a molecular and ultimately macro level. These interfibrillar structures are based on their bifunctional character, the protein parts binding to collagen fibrils at specific sites and the glycosaminoglycans duplexing and aggregating to hold the proteins and hence the collagen fibrils at defined distances from each other, rather like yardsticks. Examples of the way these functions work in specific tissues are drawn from the cornea and vitreous humour of the eye and developing tendon...|$|R
40|$|A mouse {{monoclonal}} antibody (AN 9 P 1) to <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> is described. In a competitive-inhibition solution-phase radioimmunoassay employing 125 I-labelled intact proteoglycan, it reacts preferentially with <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> {{bound to the}} core protein of adult human articular-cartilage proteoglycan and to a much lesser degree with <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> purified from this proteoglycan. Proteolytic cleavage of the proteoglycan by pepsin and trypsin has little effect on antibody binding, but treatment with papain decreases binding considerably and more than does treatment with keratanase. An even greater decrease in binding is observed after treatment with alkaline borohydride. A comparison of binding of antibody AN 9 P 1 with that of another previously described {{monoclonal antibody}}, 1 / 20 / 5 -D- 4, to <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> [Caterson, Christner & Baker (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8848 - 8854] revealed similar binding characteristics, both showing much diminished binding after papain digestion of proteoglycan and even less with purified skeletal <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Removal of the Fc piece of antibody AN 9 P 1 had no {{significant effect on the}} differential binding of divalent F(ab') 2 fragment to proteoglycan, to papain-digested proteoglycan and to <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate,</b> although there was a small decrease in binding to papain-digested proteoglycan. Conversion of the antibody into univalent Fab fragment with removal of the Fc piece resulted in diminished binding to proteoglycan, compared with that observed with IgG, and in enhanced binding to free <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> and to papain-digested proteoglycan. These results suggest that close proximity of <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> chains on the core protein of proteoglycans favours preferential reactivity of bivalent antibody with these species through cross-bridging of chains by antibody. Conversely, much decreased binding to <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> on proteoglycan core-protein fragments and to free <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> results from a lack of close proximity of <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate.</b> By using univalent Fab fragment in these assays these differences in binding are minimized by preventing cross-bridging and thereby enhancing detection of smaller fragments without sacrificing too much sensitivity of detection of larger proteoglycan species. The persistent preferential binding of Fab fragment to proteoglycan is probably in part the result of the increased epitope density in the intact molecule compared with <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> in a more disperse form...|$|E
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author © 2005 Dr. Christopher James Poon. Arthritis is a debilitating disease of the joints caused by the accelerated breakdown of cartilage, resulting in painful, swollen joints. Cartilage protects the joint by absorbing the shock {{that would otherwise be}} transferred directly to the underlying bone. One crucial component of cartilage is a specialised molecule known as aggrecan. Aggrecan consists of a core protein with three globular domains (G 1, G 2 and G 3) and is modified with over one hundred highly sulphated glycosaminoglycan chains. Two types of glycosaminoglycans are substituted {{along the length of the}} protein, chondroitin sulphate and <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate.</b> The glycosaminoglycans impart a highly negative charge to the tissue, giving it the ability to retain water and resist compressive forces. Aggrecan is lost from cartilage following cleavage by aggrecanases. Too little aggrecan in cartilage destabilises the structural integrity of the tissue and is associated with arthritis. Of the five known aggrecanase cleavage sites, it is cleavage within the interglobular domain (IGD) between the G 1 and G 2 domains at NITEGE 373 - 374 ARGSVI that directly contributes to loss of aggrecan function. The chondroitin sulphate and <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> located between the G 2 and G 3 domains is responsible for maintaining the biomechanical properties of aggrecan. The role of <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> within the G 1 -G 2 domain is unknown, but it is not thought to be essential for aggrecan function. However the literature suggests a possible role of <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> in facilitating aggrecanase cleavage of NITEGE 373 - 374 ARGSVI in the IGD. The aim of my project was to examine the role of <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> in aggrecanase-mediated cleavage of aggrecan in the IGD. Three major goals have been accomplished in this thesis: 1) Identification of a cell type capable of sustained <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> synthesis. 2) Expression of a recombinant G 1 -G 2 protein substituted with <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> (rG 1 -G 2). 3) Demonstration that endogenous N-linked <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> is sufficient to potentiate aggrecanase cleavage of rG 1 -G 2 in the IGD. Cultured cells do not synthesise <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Therefore identifying a cell type, and culture conditions to maximise <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> synthesis, was a major undertaking. Conditions were identified which allowed for maximal <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> synthesis, albeit on a small scale, in primary bovine keratocytes. Using a Vaccinia virus expression system, recombinant G 1 -G 2 was expressed in primary bovine keratocytes. Analysis of the rG 1 -G 2 revealed that it was substituted with 5 kDa of <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate.</b> One important aspect of the study was that the <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> was all N-linked to the core protein. Subsequent aggrecanase digests, comparing substrates before and after removal of <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate,</b> showed that aggrecanase cleavage was markedly more efficient when <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> was present. The results contained in this thesis add significantly to the established literature by providing a greater understanding of the mechanisms involved in aggrecanase-mediated cleavage of aggrecan and cartilage destruction. The results suggest that aggrecan substitution with N-linked <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> potentiates aggrecanase activity. The results from this study identify N-linked <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> as a possible target for the development of new drugs for the management of arthritis. Open Acces...|$|E

Attempts to reduce alveolar bone resorption {{have included the}} placement of natural roots, root analogues, and immediate implants into the extraction socket, sometimes in combination with membrane or graft techniques. Various materials are used in modern dental and maxillofacial surgery for bone tissue substitution and reconstruction. All osteoplastic materials {{can be divided into}} four groups by origin: autogenic, allogenic, xenogenic and synthetic. The development of new medical technologies enables use of achievements in material science, biochemistry, molecular biology and genetic engineering while creating new combined synthetic materials for bone grafting. Alveolar ridge resorption has long been considered an unavoidable consequence of tooth extraction. Atrophy of the alveolar bone may cause significant esthetic and surgical problems in implantation, as well as at prosthetic and restorative dentistry. Guided bone-regeneration techniques and the use of bone-replacement materials have been shown to enhance socket healing and potentially modify the resorption process. In the current review of the literature, techniques for alveolar ridge preservation are discussed. This review describes the socket preservation, and the various techniques and materials used for extraction site grafting. Synthetic resorbable materials were intended as an inexpensive substitute for natural hydroxyapatite (HAP). Synthetic graft materials include various types of calcium phosphate ceramics: tribasic calcium phosphate; bioglass; HAP and its compositions with collagen, sulphated glycosaminoglycans such as <b>keratan</b> and chrondroitin <b>sulphate</b> as well as with sulphate and calcium phosphate.

For further characterization of the epitope, reduced and 3 H-labelled <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> chains were prepared.

It contained mostly chondroitin 4 -sulphate, some chondroitin 6 -sulphate, and <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Embryonic chicken cartilage was previously shown to contain mostly chondroitin 4 -sulphate, some chondroitin 6 -sulphate and essentially no <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate.</b> The matrix produced in chondrocyte cell cultures was shown to contain a protein–polysaccharide with alkali-labile linkages of chondroitin 4 -sulphate to the protein core. A fraction was isolated from the matrix with many properties of <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of the repeat region and chain caps of the N-linked <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> chains attached to bovine tracheal cartilage fibromodulin has been examined. The chains were fragmented by keratanase digestion, the resultant oligosaccharides isolated by strong anion-exchange chromatography, and their structures determined using high-field 1 H-n. m. r. spectroscopy. The chains were found to possess the following general structure: [formula: see text] All of the capping oligosaccharides isolated terminate with alpha(2 - 3) -linked N-acetylneuraminic acid. No alpha(2 - 6) -linked N-acetylneuraminic acid chain terminators, nor any fucose, alpha (1 - 3) -linked to N-acetylglucosamine along the repeat region, were detected. This work demonstrates that the {{structure of}} the repeat region and chain caps of N-linked <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> attached to fibromodulin isolated from bovine tracheal cartilage is identical with that of O-linked <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> chains attached to aggrecan derived from non-articular cartilage...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{structural}} {{comparisons were}} made between keratan sulphates isolated from various sources, namely pig nucleus pulposus, bovine cornea, and the costal cartilages of children, {{a young adult}} with Marfan syndrome and of old human autopsies. In human costal cartilage the amount of <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> increases markedly with age, although total mucopolysaccharide decreases to some extent, concomitant with a decrease in chondroitin 4 -sulphate {{and an increase in}} chondroitin 6 -sulphate. Comparison of molecular weights estimated by gel chromatography with those calculated from the molar ratio of galactose to mannose indicates that keratan sulphates of human costal cartilages of children and of a young adult with Marfan syndrome, and of pig nucleus pulposus, contain one mannose residue per chain, whereas keratan sulphates of old human costal cartilage and of bovine cornea contain one to two, and two, per chain respectively. After mild acid-catalysed desulphation of pig nucleus pulposus <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate,</b> approx. 12 % of the mucopolysaccharide aggregates irreversibly once the water is removed from the polysaccharide. The following conclusions have been drawn from a methylation analysis of keratan sulphates of various sources, aided by g. l. c. -mass spectrometry. (1) Fucose and N-acetylneuraminic acid are non-reducing terminal residues and the sialic acid is linked to the 3 -position of galactose residues. (2) Pig nucleus pulposus <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> has approximately 4 non-reducing terminal groups per molecule and appears to be slightly less branched than the costal-cartilage <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> of children. The branching in human costal-cartilage keratan sulphates decreases with age. Bovine corneal <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> appears to be unbranched. (3) Mannose residues are linked by 3 different substituents in human costal-cartilage and bovine corneal keratan sulphates, and by two different substituents in pig nucleus pulposus <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate.</b> (4) The sulphate ester groups are all on the 6 -position of N-acetyl-glucosamine and galactose residues. The degree of sulphation increases with age in costal keratan sulphates with the increase mainly of the galactose 6 -sulphate residues...|$|E
40|$|Proteoglycans were {{extracted}} from bovine corneal stroma with 4 M-guanidinum chloride, purified by DEAE-dellulose chromatography (Antonopoulos et al., 1974) and fractionated by precipitation with ethanol into three fractions of approximately equal weight. One of these fractions {{consisted of a}} proteoglycan that contained <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> as the only glycosaminoglycan. In the othertwo fractions proteoglycans that contained chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate and <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> were present. Proteoglycans which had a more than tenfold excess of galactosaminoglycans over <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> could be obtianed by further subfractionation. The gel-chromatographic patterns of the glucosaminoglycans before and after digestion with chondroitinase AC differed for the fractions. The individual chondroitin sulphate chains seemed to be larger in cornea than in cartilage. Oligosaccharides, possibly covalently linked to the protein core of the proteoglycans, could be isolated from all fractions. The corneal proteoglycans were shown to have higher protein contents and to be of smaller molecular size than cartilage proteoglycans...|$|E
40|$|Proteoglycans are of {{fundamental}} {{importance to the}} normal functioning of the cornea. They consist of a core protein to which one or more glycosaminoglycan chains are attached. Cell surface proteoglycans are known to mediate many aspects of cell behaviour including cell adhesion, control of extracellular matrix deposition, cell proliferation, cell migration, leukocyte adhesion and modulation of growth factor activity. This paper describes the first investigation into the distribution and function of the three main classes of proteoglycans on human corneal endothelium. Immuno-gold labelling techniques were used at the light, scanning and transmission electron microscope level to localise heparan sulphate, chondroitin sulphate and <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> proteoglycans on human corneal endothelium. Human corneas were freeze-wounded and kept in organ culture for 3 days in order to study the distribution of proteoglycans on migrating corneal endothelium. An Optimas image analysis system was used to quantify the change in proteoglycan labelling during cell migration. Labelling for chondroitin sulphate and heparan sulphate was at very low levels on normal corneal endothelium while <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> labelling was at high levels. The wound healing experiments showed that migrating cells had increased labelling for heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate with greatly decreased labelling for <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Statistical analysis showed these changes were highly significant (P< 0. 001). Transmission electron microscopy revealed that chondroitin sulphate and <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> were present throughout Descemet's membrane while heparan sulphate was concentrated at the interface of Descemet's membrane and the migrating corneal endothelial cells. The pattern of occurrence of chondroitin sulphate, heparan sulphate and <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> on the human endothelium in normal and wounded cornea suggests that these proteoglycans {{are linked to the}} process of cell migration...|$|E

The spectra are consistent with an N-acetyl-lactosamine repeating unit that is predominantly sulphated at C- 6 of both galactose and N-acetylglucosamine.

40|$|<b>Keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> chains were {{isolated}} from bovine tracheal ring cartilage (15 - 18 -month-old animals) after papain digestion {{of the tissue}} followed by ethanol fractionation, chondroitinase ABC digestion and alkaline borohydride reduction. The <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> chains were further purified by anion-exchange chromatography on a Pharmacia Mono-Q column in order to remove any contaminating chondroitin sulphate and O-linked oligosaccharides. The chains were then treated with keratanase and the digest was subjected to alkaline borohydride reduction, producing oligosaccharides with galactitol at their reducing ends. The reduced digest was chromatographed on a Nucleosil 5 SB anion-exchange column and individual oligosaccharides {{were isolated}}. One of these, oligosaccharide (I), was shown by 500 MHz 1 H-n. m. r. spectroscopy to have the following structure: NeuAc alpha 2 - 3 Gal beta 1 - 4 GlcNAc(6 SO 4) beta 1 - 3 Gal-ol (I) The structure of this oligosaccharide shows that <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> chains from bovine tracheal ring cartilage may be terminated with N-acetylneuraminic acid linked alpha (2 - 3) to an unsulphated galactose. <b>Keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> chains were also isolated from bovine femoral head cartilage (15 - 18 -month-old animals) using an identical protocol, but with keratanase which was subsequently shown to have sialidase activity.

When analyzed through the depth of the cartilage, <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> was shown to appear first in the deep zones and later in the surface, while water content was lost mainly in the deep zones. On a dry weight basis collagen content decreased with age. This was not a real loss but was due to a change in the proportions of other materials, mainly in the deep zones...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{carry out}} a {{detailed}} morphological study of the cornea of a 16 year old female with a Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (MLS). Methods: Following a penetrating keratoplasty in July 1999, ultrastructural changes in the cornea were examined using electron microscopy. Proteoglycans were visualised using cuprolinic blue dye; and βig-h 3 and <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> were detected by immunoelectron microscopy. Results: The epithelial cells were degenerate and contained apoptotic nuclei. Proteoglycans were present in epithelial cells, intercellular spaces, and in swollen desmosomes. An abnormally large quantity of proteoglycans was present throughout the stroma. Keratocytes throughout the stroma had no cell organelles, were vacuolated, and contained a large quantity of abnormal proteoglycans. Labelling for βig-h 3 was intense around electron lucent spaces in stroma. No labelling was seen in keratocytes or endothelial cells. In normal cornea, <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> labelling was regular throughout the stroma. In MLS VI type B cornea, <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> labelling was weak in the anterior stroma but very intense in the posterior stroma and in keratocyte lysosomes and vacuoles. Conclusion: A deficiency of aryl sulfatase B results in the deposition of <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> proteoglycan and other proteoglycans in lysosomes, causing the death of keratocytes and an abnormal build-up of proteoglycans in the stroma. This might {{be responsible for the}} lateral aggregation of collagen fibrils and impaired fibrillogenesis in MLS VI. Degenerate swollen keratocytes, together with gross changes in epithelial, stromal, and endothelial cells, would be expected to increase light scattering significantly in these corneas...|$|E

Here we inves-tigate the distribution and time course of deposition {{of a range of}} proteoglycans between 4 and 14 days following unilateral axotomy of the nigrostriatal tract in anaesthetised adult rats. Immunolabelling using a variety of antibodies was used to examine the response of heparan sulphate proteoglycans, chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans and <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> proteoglycans. We observed that many proteoglycans became abundant between 1 and 2 weeks post-axotomy. Heparan sulphate proteoglycans were predominantly found within the lesion core (populated by blood vessels, amoeboid macrophages and meningeal ¢broblasts) whereas chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans and <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> proteoglycans were predominantly found in the lesion surround (populated by reactive astrocytes, activated microglia and adult precursor cells). Immunolabelling indicated that cut dopaminergic nigral axons sprouted proli¢cally within the lesion core but rarely grew into the lesion surround. We conclude that sprouting of cut dopaminergic nigral axons may be supported by heparan sulphate proteoglycans but restricted by chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans and <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> proteoglycans. ß 2002 IBRO.

Both lysosomal beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases A and B are proposed {{to participate in}} the degradation of <b>keratan</b> <b>sulphate</b> {{on the basis of the}} following observations. Homogenates of fibroblasts from patients with Sandhoff disease, but not those from patients with Tay [...] Sachs disease, were unable to release significant amounts of N-acetyl[3 H]glucosamine. On isoelectric focusing of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase from human liver the peaks of keratan sulphate-degrading activity coincided with the activity towards p-nitrophenyl beta-N-acetylglucosaminide. A monospecific antibody against the human enzyme reacted with both enzyme forms and precipitated the keratan sulphate-degrading activity. Both isoenzymes had the same apparent Km of 4 mM, but the B form was approximately twice as active as the A form when compared with the activity towards a chromogenic substrate. Differences were noted in the pH [...] activity profiles of both isoenzymes. Thermal inactivation of isoenzyme B was less pronounced towards the polymeric substrate than towards the p-nitrophenyl derivative...|$|E
