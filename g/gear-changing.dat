50|$|Most units had Standard Mechanical Transmission. This {{comprised}} a fluid coupling, a freewheel and a four-speed epicyclic pre-selector gearbox. The freewheel facilitated <b>gear-changing</b> {{and also}} had an important safety function. If an engine seized, the freewheel would disengage and give protection against transmission damage and possible derailment.|$|E
50|$|The name Self-Changing Gears is {{sometimes}} confusing: the gearboxes {{are not fully}} automatic, selection of gear ratio remains a manual choice, but the <b>gear-changing</b> and any clutch control needed is automated.

5000|$|A 21st century reader {{might better}} {{understand}} the <b>gear-changing</b> difficulties of early motoring compounded {{by the lack of}} syncromesh gearboxes by reading this excerpt from that 1931 Autocar roadtest: [...] "To obtain the best out of the car it is desirable to use the gearbox sensibly, and to change down early[...] [...] [...] This is a matter of small consequence, for the reason that the gear change is extraordinarily easy to accomplish between top and third without paying much attention {{to the use of the}} accelerator pedal. All the same the gear change responds just as readily to the more orthodox style of handling, and a little practice with double-clutching and finding the right pauses soon gives a quiet mastery." ...|$|E
50|$|Electric {{transmission}} {{has been}} available {{as an alternative to}} conventional mechanical transmissions since 1903. Typically mechanical transmissions impose many penalties, including weight, bulk, noise, cost, complexity and a drain on engine power with every <b>gear-change,</b> whether accomplished manually or automatically. Unlike ICEs, electric motors do not require a transmission.|$|R

5000|$|The SensoDrive five speed {{semi-automatic}} transmission is an electronically controlled manual gearbox, with the clutch and <b>gear-change</b> functions electronically managed.

The SensoDrive gearbox is managed by a control unit, which controls two actuators.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lightweight}} {{chain of}} a bicycle with derailleur gears can snap (or rather, come {{apart at the}} side-plates, since it is normal for the [...] "riveting" [...] to fail first) because the pins inside are not cylindrical, they are barrel-shaped. Contact between the pin and the bushing is not the regular line, but a point which allows the chain's pins to work {{its way through the}} bushing, and finally the roller, ultimately causing the chain to snap. This form of construction is necessary because the <b>gear-changing</b> action of this form of transmission requires the chain to both bend sideways and to twist, but this can occur with the flexibility of such a narrow chain and relatively large free lengths on a bicycle.|$|E

40|$|Semi-natural {{tests for}} active {{pneumatic}} suspension of a 18 -tonne tourist bus {{with the system}} of automatic body stabilization of the mobile machine and feed-back coupling according to kinematics parameter. The test have been executed in the cases when the bus is stocked with an automatic hydro-mechanical transmission {{in the process of}} speed picking up, <b>gear-changing</b> or road braking which is assigned by accidental road humps. A computer simulation of dynamic structures in combination with virtual devices and real objects (HIL – Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation) has been carried in the paper. Personal computers, software, programmed logic controller, frequency generator, solenoid-operated valve have been used for the investigation process. The paper proposes an unconventional method for improvement operational characteristics which is based on integrated control of a suspension and automatic hydro-mechanical transmission. A mathematical model includes systems of automatic transmission, suspension and module for generation of accidental road humps. The model has been considered as a basis for semi-natural laboratory bench with industrially-manufactured controller, other components of automatic systems and standard control organs. The most efficient method for body stabilization is control of the suspension according to the parameter of angular rate during vertical turn of an automobile’s center line with {{a turning point in the}} center of mass. The developed algorithm and stabilization system according to angular rate of body’s center line turning have made it possible to improve dynamics of the bus while making <b>gear-changing</b> and to reduce fuel consumption during starting-up and speed picking-up processes. During the braking process such system simultaneously decreases oscillation amplitude of some parameters more than two-fold. </p...|$|E

40|$|The current {{version of}} the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (HCM 2010) gives {{guidance}} on commercial truck speeds on grade {{through the use of}} truck speed versus distance–grade curves, which are located in the HCM 2010, Chapter 11. These curves are designed to allow the analyst to estimate a commercial truck’s speed after it travels on a known distance of roadway with a certain grade. Typically, these curves are used to determine an equivalent grade (incline–decline and length) that will result in the same final speed of commercial trucks as would the series of grades making up a composite grade. The HCM 2010 curves were developed as a result of studies that used simulation tools. These simulation tools used a simple lookup table approach for maximum acceleration versus speed and did not account for commercial truck transmission <b>gear–changing</b> capabilities. These shortcomings, along with changes in truck performance over the past 20 years, necessitate an update to the HCM 2010 speed versus distance–grade curves. This study presents the development of updated speed versus distance–grade curves for commercial trucks by using TRUCKSIM. This simulation tool uses a modeling approach of full-vehicle dynamics, which ensures that commercial truck performance is accurately represented for field conditions. The results show that the performance of commercial trucks, as presented in the HCM 2010, is worse than that currently observed. Therefore, the authors recommend that the current speed versus distance–grade curves included in the HCM be replaced with those presented in this study...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Global {{automotive}} industry is growing rapidly in recent years. Increased torque range with deeper transmission ratio {{as well as}} overall vehicle refinements in modern trucks places higher demands on transmission and its components. Changing market requirement and driver comfort is also a new challenge in commercial market. With this overall effects design and development of transmission and its components {{plays a major role}} for performance, comfort and economically driven market. Synchronizer is one of the critical components which need to look upon. Synchronizer plays a vital role for gear shifting performance in manual gearbox without any shifting assistance. Synchronizers primary function is to reduce the rpm difference between two gears before gear shifting subject to time and more comfort. Increasing demand for performance, enhance life, less shift effort, less synchronization time, optimum size of Synchro pack and low cost has become an interesting area for engineer for improvement. More over existing synchronizer can be economically re-engineered into more efficient designs with the help of new mathematical tools and techniques. A mathematical optimization model can be developed to establish optimum cone parameter. A model of relationship can built between cone angle and sleeve champers angle, synchronizer size, coefficient of friction, cone torque and index torque. In this study a model was built in Matlab optimization toolbox pattern-search solver to find global minimum value of Cone angle which satisfy set of given and known design constrains. This Model can be used to select first cut synchro parameter with moderate accuracy. These Values can be then finer tune by customized and specialized software’s. It is not easy to study the entire <b>gear-changing</b> process from clutch till wheels, dynamical behavior of manual gearbox is too complicated to simulate, owing to the large number of elements involved in it. This study considers only major parameter involved in synchronization. Also generous experience and data is required to accurately select parameter with desired Shift feel and comfort...|$|E
40|$|The {{agricultural}} industry {{has not seen}} significant innovation in development of low-cost automated farming solutions, with current systems costing several {{thousands of dollars to}} implement. Currently these automated solutions are primarily implemented around crop planting and harvesting, and the large implementation cost of these systems makes them unfeasible for small-scale operations. Within many agricultural industries, workers expend a considerable amount of time undertaking simple tasks that are labour intensive. Many of these tasks could instead be completed using a self-driving robotic platform outfitted with the appropriate devices required for the tasks. This thesis covers the research work aiming to produce a solution that could turn an existing farming vehicle into a multipurpose low-cost agricultural platform, to act as the platform for an autonomous vehicle capable of performing pre-programmed tasks within an agricultural environment. A quad bike was selected as the vehicle platform for this research in which the control modules would control the speed and direction of this farm bike. Four modules were developed to control the vehicle components that would normally be operated by a human operator. These modules are comprised of mechanical actuators coupled with a microcontroller control system and includes some specific designs to maintain the user's ability to manually control the pre-existing systems. A <b>gear-changing</b> module controls the vehicles manual gearbox, providing a method to detect and control the vehicles current gear. A speed control module was developed to control the vehicles throttle and braking system and detects the vehicles speed. A steering module controls the vehicles steering system, allowing for accurate control of the vehicles direction. Finally, a vehicle controller module provides a central command interface that ties the previous three modules together and controls the vehicles electrical components and engine. Development of a low-cost differential GPS (DGPS) system was also undertaken to reduce the implementation cost of the system. Due to inconclusive results in relation to the positional accuracy of this system is was decided that a standard GPS system would be used for the vehicle prototype with further development on the DGPS system would be undertaken in future development of the research. The successful development of a farm automated vehicle platform was achieved through this research. With further improvement on software, intelligent control {{and the development of a}} low-cost differential global positioning satellite (GPS) system, a fully autonomous farm platform that can be outfitted with different tools or devices for the required farm tasks is feasible and practical...|$|E
