5|$|In contrast, the {{grooming}} hypothesis {{emphasized that}} all lemuriforms use their toothcombs for grooming, and long, thin teeth are poorly {{suited for the}} mechanical stress of <b>gouging</b> and exudate feeding. Also the interdental spaces seen in most lemuriforms favor fur combing and would also promote bacterial growth and tooth decay if used for exudate feeding.

Even the behavior of young lemuriforms suggests that grooming plays a more {{important role in the}} use of the toothcomb than food procurement.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTwo TCDP {{boreholes}} A and B were {{drilled in}} the northern part of the Chelungpu thrust fault where the Chi-Chi earthquake (21 September 1999, Mw 7. 6) showed large displacement, low ground acceleration, and high slip velocity. In this paper, we describe the microstructures of the Chi-Chi Principal Slip Zone (PSZ) within black <b>gouges</b> localized at 1111 m depth in Hole A and at 1136 m depth in Hole B. In the FZA 1111 the PSZ is a 2 cm-thick isotropic clay-rich <b>gouge</b> which contains aggregates formed by central clasts coated by clay cortex (clay-clast aggregates (CCAs)) and fragments of older <b>gouges</b> segregated in the top third of the PSZ. In FZB 1136 the PSZ is 3 mm thick and is characterized by a foliated <b>gouge</b> displaying an alternation of clay-rich and clast-rich layers. The presence of CCAs, plucked underlying <b>gouge</b> fragments, <b>gouge</b> injections, and the occurrence of reverse grain size segregation of large clasts in the FZA 1111 isotropic <b>gouge</b> suggest that the <b>gouge</b> was fluidized as a result of frictional heating and thermal pressurization. The foliated <b>gouge</b> in FZB 1136 may be one locus of strain localization and related heat production. Small calcite veins present above the isotropic FZA 1111 PSZ <b>gouge</b> and, characterized by an increasing strain with increasing distance away from the PSZ, are attributed to coseismic fluid escape from the pressurized <b>gouge.</b> The observed microstructures are interpreted in view of their seismic implications for the Chi-Chi earthquake in terms of slip weakening mechanisms by thermal pressurization, <b>gouge</b> fluidization, coseismic fluid distribution, and postseismic slip. Above the PSZ, several layers of compacted <b>gouges</b> containing deformed CCAs and <b>gouge</b> fragments correspond to several PSZ of past earthquakes similar to the Chi-Chi earthquake and display a fault-parallel cleavage resulting from a low strain rate pressure solution deformation mechanism that may be correlated to the interseismic periods...|$|R

5|$|Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony in July 1890. A {{month later}} the British and Transvaalers agreed to joint control over Swaziland (without {{consulting}} the Swazis)—the South African Republic {{could build a}} railway through it to Kosi Bay {{on the condition that}} the Transvaal thereafter supported the interests of Rhodes's Chartered Company in Matabeleland and its environs. Kruger honoured the latter commitment in 1891 when he outlawed the Adendorff Trek, another would-be emigration to Mashonaland, over the protests of Joubert and many others. This, along with his handling of the economy and the civil service—now widely perceived as overloaded with Dutch imports—caused opposition to grow. The industrial monopolies Kruger's administration granted became widely derided as corrupt and inefficient, especially the dynamite concession given to Edouard Lippert and a French consortium, which Kruger was forced to revoke in 1892 amid much scandal over misrepresentation and price <b>gouging.</b>|$|E

Castro was sentenced separately, on October 16, during which he delivered a speech that would be printed under the title of History Will Absolve Me. Although the maximum penalty for leading an uprising was a 20 years, Castro was sentenced to 15, being imprisoned in the hospital wing of the Model Prison (Presidio Modelo), a relatively comfortable and modern institution on the Isla de Pinos, 60 miles off of Cuba's southwest coast.|$|E
5|$|Yellow-tailed black {{cockatoos}} {{can cause}} damage in pine and eucalyptus plantations by weakening stems through <b>gouging</b> out {{pieces of wood}} to extract moth larvae. In places with these gum plantations, {{the population of the}} larva of the cossid moth Xyleutes boisduvali grows, which then leads to increased predation (and hence tree damage) by cockatoos. Furthermore, plantations generally lack undergrowth which might have prevented cockatoos from damaging younger trees. Yellow-tailed black cockatoos were shot as pests in some districts of New South Wales until the 1940s because of this. The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is promoted by the Shoalhaven City Council local government on the NSW south coast as the region's bird.

40|$|Strain {{localization}} during coseismic slip in fault <b>gouges</b> is {{a critical}} mechanical process that has implications for understanding frictional heating, the earthquake energy budget {{and the evolution of}} fault rock microstructure. To assess the nature of strain localization during shearing of calcite fault <b>gouges,</b> high-velocity (vmax= 1 m/s) rotary-shear experiments at normal stresses of 3 – 20 MPa were conducted under room-dry and wet conditions on synthetic calcite <b>gouges</b> containing dolomite <b>gouge</b> strain markers. When sheared at 1 m/s, the room-dry <b>gouges</b> showed a prolonged strengthening phase prior to dynamic weakening, whereas the wet <b>gouges</b> weakened nearly instantaneously. Microstructural analysis revealed that a thin (< 600 μm) high-strain layer and through-going principal slip surface (PSS) developed after several centimeters of slip in both dry and wet <b>gouges,</b> and that strain localization at 1 m/s occurred progressively and rapidly. The strain accommodated in the bulk <b>gouge</b> layer did not change significantly with increasing displacement indicating that, once formed, the high-strain layer and PSS accommodated most of the displacement. Thus, a substantial strain gradient is present in the <b>gouge</b> layer. In water-dampened <b>gouges,</b> localization likely occurs during and after dynamic weakening. Our results suggest that natural fault zones in limestone are more prone to rapid dynamic weakening if water is present in the granular slipping zones...|$|R

Here, we aim {{to determine the effect}} of the transition to muscovite-rich fault rock at depths beyond the illite-dominated region of the seismogenic zone. To achieve this, rotary friction experiments were performed on simulated muscovite-quartz (65 : 35) <b>gouge</b> at 100 - 600. °C, an effective normal stress of 170. MPa, pore pressures of 100 and 200. MPa, and sliding velocities of 1 - 100. μm/s. We isolated the effects of muscovite by shearing pure muscovite <b>gouge</b> at 200 - 600. °C, under otherwise identical conditions. At low shear strains (γ≈ 1), muscovite-quartz <b>gouge</b> showed a friction coefficient μ of 0. 4 - 0. 5, while pure muscovite <b>gouge</b> exhibited μ≈ 0. 3. Both <b>gouges</b> showed an increase in μ with γ and temperature. The muscovite-quartz <b>gouge</b> was characterised by velocity-strengthening or neutral behaviour at 100 - 350. °C, velocity-weakening at 350 - 500. °C and velocity-strengthening at 500 - 600. °C. In contrast, pure muscovite <b>gouge</b> showed predominantly velocity-strengthening or neutral behaviour, demonstrating a key role of quartz in producing velocity-weakening. The velocity-weakening regime in the mixed <b>gouge</b> extends that of 250 - 400. °C, recently reported for illite-quartz <b>gouge,</b> up to 500. °C. Taking into account the observed effect of sliding velocity on (a-b), the data for illite-quartz and muscovite-quartz together help explain the depth extent of seismogenesis on subduction megathrusts.
