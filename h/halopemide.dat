40|$|<b>Halopemide</b> {{is a new}} psychotropic agent, {{structurally}} {{related to}} the neuroleptics of the butyrophenone type, but with a different pharmacological and clinical profile. The concentration of <b>halopemide</b> in the rat brain is about 10 times {{less than that of}} R 29800, its chemical congener and of spiperone, both typical neuroleptics. In the pituitary gland, however, the levels are the same. The distribution profile of <b>halopemide</b> in rat brain deviates from that of neuroleptics. The highest level of <b>halopemide</b> is found in septal and thalamic areas whereas the neuroleptics are concentrated in the caudate nucleus, the nucleus accumbens and the tuberculum olfactorium.

40|$|Background. The role of {{phospholipase}} D (PLD) as {{a positive}} modulator of glucose uptake activation by insulin in muscle and adipose cells has been demonstrated. The role of PLD in the regulation of glucose metabolism by insulin in the primary hepatocytes has been determined in this study. Methods. For this purpose, we studied effects of inhibitors of PLD on glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis stimulation by insulin. To determine the PLD activity, the method based on determination of products of transphosphatidylation reaction, phosphatidylethanol or phosphatidylbutanol, was used. Results. Inhibition of PLD by a general antagonist (1 -butanol) or specific inhibitor, <b>halopemide,</b> or N-hexanoylsphingosine, or by cellular ceramides accumulated in doxorubicin-treated hepatocytes decreased insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism. Doxorubicin-induced hepatocytes resistance to insulin action could be abolished by inhibition of ceramide production. <b>Halopemide</b> could nullify this effect. Addition of propranolol, as well as inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) (wortmannin, LY 294002) or suppressors of Akt phosphorylation/activity, luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside or apigenin- 7 -O-glucoside, to the culture media could block cell response to insulin action.

40|$|The P 2 X 7 {{receptor}} is a trimeric ATP-gated cation channel {{important in}} health and disease. We have observed that the specific phospholipase D (PLD) 1 antagonist, CAY 10593 impairs P 2 X 7 -induced shedding of the &# 039;low affinity&# 039; IgE receptor, CD 23. The current study investigated the mode of action of this compound on P 2 X 7 activation. Measurements of ATP-induced ethidium+ uptake revealed that CAY 10593 impaired P 2 X 7 -induced pore formation in human RPMI 8226 B cells, P 2 X 7 -transfected HEK- 293 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Concentration response curves demonstrated that CAY 10593 impaired P 2 X 7 -induced pore formation in RPMI 8226 cells more potently than the PLD 2 antagonist CAY 10594 and the non-specific PLD antagonist <b>halopemide.</b> Electrophysiology measurements demonstrated that CAY 10593 also inhibited P 2 X 7 -induced inward currents. Notably, RT-PCR demonstrated that PLD 1 was absent in RPMI 8226 cells, while choline-Cl medium or 1 -butanol, which block PLD stimulation and signalling respectively did not impair P 2 X 7 activation in these cells. This data indicates that CAY 10593 impairs human P 2 X 7 independently of PLD 1 stimulation and {{highlights the importance of}} ensuring that compounds used in signalling studies downstream of P 2 X 7 activation do not affect the receptor itself...|$|E

Two {{synthetic}} pathways were investigated: {{the first one}} required the alkylation of the norbenzyl precursor with 2 - or 4 -[18 F]fluorobenzyl bromide (radiochemical yield of 5 % EOB, 180 min); the second method consisted of a reductive amination of norbenzyl tropapride with 2 - or 4 -[18 F]fluorobenzaldehyde (20 % EOB, 110 min). In both cases, the specific activity {{was found to be}} greater than 1 Ci/mumol (EOS). Animal studies in rats showed the percentage of the injected dose localizing in the whole brain to be 0. 6 +/- 0. 09 and 0. 2 +/- 0. 03 at 2 h post injection for the para- and the ortho-[18 F]fluoro analogs of tropapride respectively. Cerebral biodistribution studies showed at 4 h a striatum uptake of 5 +/- 0. 7 % of the injected dose per gram of striatum for the para derivative with a low fixation into the frontal cortex and the cerebellum (% ID/g FC < 0. 4 and % ID/g Cb < 0. 3).

40|$|Phospholipase D (PLD) is a {{key enzyme}} for the {{remodeling}} of phospholipids in the cell membrane. PLD has been implicated in many physiological functions such as chemotaxis and phagocytosis as well as pathological functions such as ischemia/reperfusion and cancer metastasis. Several small molecule inhibitors of PLD have been recently developed to overcome these pathological effects. We have concentrated on 5 -Fluoro- 2 -Indolyl des-Chlorohalopemide (FIPI) which is an indole derivative of <b>halopemide</b> that inhibits the two mammalian isoforms PLD 1 and PLD 2. We also concentrate on N-[2 -[1 -(3 -Fluorophenyl) - 4 -oxo- 1, 3,- 8 -triazaspiro[4. 5]dec- 8 -yl]ethyl]- 2 -naphthalenecarboxamide (NFOT) and N-[2 -(4 -oxo- 1 -phenyl- 1, 3, 8 -triazaspiro[4, 5]dec- 8 -yl) ethyl]- 2 -naphthalenecarboxamide (NOPT) that are specific inhibitors of the PLD 2 isoform. In spite of knowing their specificity derived from in vitro assays, the mechanism of action of these inhibitors has never been studied. Here for the first time, we show the site of action of FIPI and NFOT on PLD {{as well as a}} mechanism of enzymatic action that explains in vivo actions. Our studies showed that FIPI is a non-reversible inhibitor of PLD that binds to the HKD, whereas NFOT shows mixed type of inhibition, which suggests that inhibitor binding site might be anywhere in the regulatory PX or PH domains of PLD 2 or the catalytic region HKD. We performed extensive mutational analysis on PLD 2 and our results clearly indicate that FIPI binds to S 757 residue and S 648 and a PIP 2 binding site are critical for NFOT to inhibit PLD 2, since mutating these key amino acid(s) resulted in partial resistance of the enzyme towards the inhibitor. Inhibitor dose dependent assays of the resistant PLD 2 mutants F 244 N/L 245 A/L 246 A and S 648 A confirmed the same. Also, the mutants exhibited resistance against the inhibitors unlike wild-type, in performing chemotaxis further confirming physiological relevance. In addition, we uncovered the effect of PLD 2 binding partners, Grb 2 and Ras on the efficacy of inhibitors. Mechanistically it was found that Grb 2 positively regulates PLD 2, while Ras has a negative effect on PLD 2 and that the small molecule inhibitor 2 ̆ 7 s action on PLD 2 is affected by the absence or presence of Grb 2 or Ras. In conclusion, we consider the results obtained in this study regarding the key residues of PLD 2 are crucial in order to develop more potent and efficient inhibitors {{that can be used in}} vivo for pathological processes such as chronic inflammation and cancer metastasis...|$|E
40|$|The P 2 X 7 {{receptor}} is a ligand-gated cation channel, {{which is}} expressed {{on a variety}} of cell types, including human B cells. P 2 X 7 activation induces a variety of downstream events, including the shedding of the immunoglobulin E receptor, CD 23. Cell surface CD 23 and soluble CD 23 are important in the regulation of immunoglobulin E. Furthermore, soluble CD 23 functions as a proinflammatory mediator. Thus it is important to elucidate the mechanisms involved in CD 23 shedding. A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 10 constitutively sheds CD 23 from the surface of cells but whether P 2 X 7 activates ADAM 10, or other signalling processes to mediate CD 23 shedding are unknown. Our laboratory has shown that P 2 X 7 is expressed on human RPMI 8226 multiple myeloma B cells and that P 2 X 7 activation on these cells induces the shedding of CD 23. The primary aims of this thesis were: to confirm the presence of and to further characterise P 2 X 7 in RPMI 8226 cells; to examine the signalling pathways involved in P 2 X 7 -induced CD 23 shedding using this cell line as a model; to determine, using RPMI 8226 cells, whether ADAM 10 is involved in P 2 X 7 -induced CD 23 shedding; and finally to determine whether P 2 X 7 activation induces CD 23 shedding from primary human and murine B cells. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of molecules was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. P 2 X 7, CD 23 and CXCL 16 expression was detected by immunolabelling and measured by flow cytometry. Nucleotide-induced ethidium+ uptake (pore formation) was measured by flow cytometry or spectrofluorometry. Soluble CD 23 and CXCL 16 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ATP-induced currents were measured by electrophysiology. RPMI 8226 cells were shown to express mRNA for P 2 X 7 and other P 2 X subtypes (P 2 X 1, P 2 X 4 and P 2 X 5). Functional P 2 X 7 was present on RPMI 8226 cells, and the new generation P 2 X 7 antagonist AZ 10606120, near-completely impaired both P 2 X 7 -induced pore formation and CD 23 shedding in these cells. This data confirmed that the RPMI 8226 cell line is an adequate model to investigate the molecules and processes involved in P 2 X 7 -induced CD 23 shedding. Several signalling pathways involved in other P 2 X 7 -induced responses including reactive oxygen species formation, as well as changes in intracellular cation concentrations, were not involved in P 2 X 7 -induced CD 23 shedding from RPMI 8226 cells. However, the phospholipase (PLD) 1 antagonist, CAY 10593 (VU 0155069) impaired P 2 X 7 -induced CD 23 shedding from RPMI 8226 cells. CAY 10593 also impaired pore formation in RPMI 8226 cells, P 2 X 7 -transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CAY 10593 impaired P 2 X 7 -induced pore formation in RPMI 8226 cells more potently than the PLD 2 antagonist CAY 10594 and the non-specific PLD antagonist <b>halopemide.</b> CAY 10593 also inhibited P 2 X 7 -mediated inward currents. Notably, PLD 1 was absent in RPMI 8226 cells. This data indicates that CAY 10593 impairs human P 2 X 7 independently of PLD 1 stimulation and highlights the importance of ensuring that compounds used in signalling studies downstream of P 2 X 7 activation do not affect the receptor itself. RPMI 8226 cells were shown to express mRNA for ADAM 10. The ADAM 10 antagonist, GI 254023 X significantly impaired P 2 X 7 -induced CD 23 shedding from RPMI 8226 cells. ATP treatment of RPMI 8226 cells induced the rapid shedding of another ADAM 10 substrate, CXCL 16. The P 2 X 7 antagonists, AZ 10606120 and KN- 62 near completely impaired ATP-induced CXCL 16 shedding from RPMI 8226 cells and treatment of these cells with GI 254023 X significantly impaired P 2 X 7 -induced CXCL 16 shedding. This data indicates that human P 2 X 7 activation induces the rapid shedding of CD 23 and CXCL 16, and that these processes are mediated by ADAM 10. ATP treatment of primary human and murine B cells also induced the rapid shedding of CD 23. Treatment of cells with AZ 10606120, near-completely impaired ATP-induced CD 23 shedding from both human and murine B cells. ATP-induced CD 23 shedding was also impaired in B cells from P 2 X 7 knockout mice. GI 254023 X impaired P 2 X 7 -induced CD 23 shedding from both human and murine B cells. This data indicates that P 2 X 7 activation induces the rapid shedding of CD 23 from primary human and murine B cells, and that this process is also mediated by ADAM 10. Overall, this study shows, {{for the first time that}} ADAM 10 mediates P 2 X 7 -induced CD 23 and CXCL 16 shedding from RPMI 8226 cells, as well as CD 23 shedding from primary human and murine B cells. Moreover, this study excludes a potential role for various signalling molecules, including reactive oxygen species formation and the flux of various cations in P 2 X 7 -induced CD 23 shedding. Finally, this study shows that the PLD 1 antagonist, CAY 10593, impairs P 2 X 7 independently of PLD 1...|$|E
