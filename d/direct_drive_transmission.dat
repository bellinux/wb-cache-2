5000|$|... 1955: 1H Series D8 ends production; 191 hp D8E and D8D {{introduced}} {{with new}} 1,246 {{cubic inch displacement}} (CID) D342 diesel engine. D8D had a torque converter and D8E had a <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E
50|$|Well {{known for}} the very high quality of their production, Cottin & Desgouttes was also famous for the {{interest}} they demonstrated in “high-tech” solutions: {{they were among the}} first to use a single-block engine, <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>transmission</b> and universal joint-based transmission.|$|E
50|$|The next Cub Cadet {{models that}} International {{introduced}} were the models 72, 104, 124, 105, and 125. The model 72 {{was a direct}} replacement for the model 71 which used the seven-horsepower Kohler engine, three-speed <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>transmission,</b> and pan seat. The model 104 replaced the model 102 using the ten-horsepower Kohler engine and three-speed transmission. The model 124 replaced the model 122 using the twelve horsepower Kohler engine and three-speed <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>transmission.</b> The model 125 replaced the model 123 using the twelve-horsepower Kohler engine and a hydrostatic transmission. The model 105 was the first Cub Cadet to offer a ten-horsepower Kohler motor with a hydrostatic transmission. These Cub Cadet models retained the same square fenders as the previous models. The biggest difference in these Cub Cadets was their fiberglass dash which contained an ammeter. The production of the 72, 104, 124, 105, and 125 ran from 1967 to 1969.|$|E
5000|$|At the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, Koenigsegg {{presented}} {{a new car}} named the Regera, which translates into English as to [...] "reign" [...] or [...] "rule". The Regera uses the Koenigsegg <b>Direct</b> <b>Drive</b> (KDD) <b>transmission.</b> Below 30 mph, motive power is by two electric motors on the rear wheels and {{the internal combustion engine}} (ICE) is disconnected. Above 30 mph, the ICE is connected by a fixed ratio transmission with no gearbox, torque vectoring by the previously mentioned electric motors and boosted by a third electric motor attached to the driveshaft.|$|R

50|$|The Lambert {{friction}} gearing disk <b>drive</b> <b>transmission</b> {{was invented by}} John William Lambert originally in 1904. The invention relates to a friction disk <b>drive</b> <b>transmission</b> for automobiles that is gearless. He saw {{the need for a}} simple transmission of engine power to an automobile's drive wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The Berlingo électrique is {{equipped}} with <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>transmission.</b> The vehicle is often mistakenly described as having an [...] "automatic" [...] gearbox whereas in reality the very wide power range of the electric motor {{when compared with the}} very narrow power band of an Internal Combustion Engine means that more than one gear is unnecessary. The Berlingo électrique has in effect only one forward gear which serves from 0- 70 mi/h km/h. The 'gear' stick looks similar to an automatic one but is limited to Drive, Neutral, Reverse and Park.|$|E
50|$|Models 73, 106, 126, 107, 127, and 147, {{the last}} {{generation}} of Cub Cadets to utilize the narrow frame, composed {{the next generation of}} Cub Cadets. The model 73 still contained the seven horsepower Kohler engine, three speed <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>transmission,</b> pan seat, and optional round fenders. The Cub Cadet 106, which replaced the model 104, had a ten-horsepower Kohler engine and three speed transmission, while the model 126 which replaced the model 124, had a twelve-horsepower Kohler engine and a three speed <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>transmission.</b> The ten horsepower model 107 and the twelve horsepower model 127 were hydrostatic units which replaced the models 105 and 125. The model 147 was unique {{because it was the first}} model of Cub Cadet to utilize a fourteen-horsepower Kohler engine. The flywheel on this engine was so large, International had to widen the frame next to the flywheel so the engine would fit between the rails. The model 147 was also unique because it was equipped with electric lift. Electric lift used an electric motor to raise and lower implements with the movement of a switch. The most noteworthy style change in these Cub Cadet models were the wider square fenders. These are the same fenders that were standard on all the following Cub Cadet models International made and some of the early models MTD made. These models were produced from 1969 to 1971.|$|E
50|$|The next {{models of}} Cub Cadet were {{built on a}} totally new frame called a wide frame. This frame {{would be used for}} the rest of the International built Cub Cadet garden {{tractors}} as well as until recently, MTD built Cub Cadet garden tractors. International produced the models 86, 108, 128, 109, 129, and 149 which replaced the models 73, 106, 126, 107, 127, and 147 respectively. The model 86, which contained an eight-horsepower Kohler engine, a three speed <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>transmission,</b> and wide square fenders, broke away from having a different appearance as the bigger garden tractors. The ten-horsepower model 108 and the twelve horsepower model 128 each had a three speed <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>transmission.</b> Hydrostatic models included the ten horsepower 109, twelve horsepower 129, and the fourteen horsepower 149. The Cub Cadet 149 was the first model Cub Cadet to employ hydraulic lift as a standard feature. The hydraulic lift ran off from the hydrostatic transmission and allowed the operator to raise and lower implements with the push of a lever. Production of these models ran from 1971 to 1974. Because of the competition and the increasing demand form customers for more power, International introduced a sixteen-horsepower model 169 during the last year of the production run of this series in 1974. Since there were only 4,005 Cub Cadet 169s made, they've become very popular among collectors.|$|E

50|$|IH began Cub Cadet {{production}} in 1960 at the Shed in Gloria Drive, Kentucky, where the International Cub and Cub Lo-Boy tractors were also made. The first Cub Cadet model made was the International Cub Cadet Tractor, {{better known as}} the Original. The Cub Cadet Original was powered by a 7-horsepower Kohler engine and was made between 1960 and 1963. Ironically, the Original Cub Cadet didn't employ a totally <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>transmission</b> which was what later became the big selling point of Cub Cadet Garden Tractors. Instead, it incorporated a belt that ran from the flywheel to the drive shaft to turn the three-speed transmission. This system was necessary due to the way the engine sat on a platform above the drive shaft. Round fenders, headlights, and a creeper gear are all examples of optional equipment for the Original Cub Cadet.|$|E
50|$|The next {{series of}} Cub Cadets is {{commonly}} known as the Quiet Line series. Models 1000, 1100, 1200, 1250, 1450, and 1650 made up this series. These were the first Cub Cadets to feature alternators instead of starter generators. The ten-horsepower 1000 and the twelve horsepower 1200 contained a three-speed <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>transmission</b> and replaced the previous models 86, 108, and 128 respectively. The hydrostatic twelve horsepower 1250, fourteen horsepower 1450, and sixteen horsepower 1650 replaced the previous 129, 149, and 169 models respectively. Hydraulic lift was a standard feature on the models 1450 and 1650. Notice how International dropped the ten horsepower hydrostatic model. These models outward appearance is distinguished by engine side covers. These covers combined with engine ISO mounts, extra shrouding, and a larger muffler made this series significantly quieter than previous series of Cub Cadets. Production of these models ran from 1974 to 1979 making this series Internationals the longest produced series of Cub Cadets. International produced the Cub Cadet model 800 in 1974. The eight horsepower Kohler powered 800 was one of International's answers to compete with the cheap garden tractors made by MTD and Murray sold in box stores. The model 800 contained all of the same features as the models 1000 and 1200 such as the ISO mounts, side covers, and the three speed <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>transmission.</b> The 800's superior quality made it cost more than the cheap garden tractors sold in box stores. Because of this, only a few 800s were sold and it was unable to compete with the cheap box store garden tractors. This lead International to cease the production of the model 800 in 1976. The Mistake of trying to beat MTD at their own game eventually became fatal. Because there are less than 3,000 model 800s produced, they are the rarest Cub Cadets made. The Cub Cadet model 1100 was another answer International had to the lawn tractors sold in box stores. The model 1100 was an economy model which eliminated the engine side covers, and other parts to reduce cost. The 1100 was the first Cub Cadet garden tractor to deviate from the Kohler engine using an 11-horsepower Briggs and Stratton engine. The model 1100 also used a belt-driven four-speed Peerless transmission, had a striped down dash without an ammeter or hour meter, a metal fuel tank all to reduce cost. The model 1100 was produced through the entire production run of this series.|$|E

40|$|The {{trend in}} wind energy is towards large {{offshore}} wind farms. This trend {{has led to}} the demand for high reliability and large single unit wind turbines. Different energy conversion topologies such as multiple stage geared generators, single stage geared generators and gearless (<b>direct</b> <b>drive)</b> generators have been coupled to the wind turbine in the last decades. <b>Direct</b> <b>drive</b> generators based on permanent magnet technology have a high efficiency, less components and lower speeds that can translate to high energy yield and less maintenance demand. However, the mass of such <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> generators can be significantly higher than of other geared generators.
