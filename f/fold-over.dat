50|$|At {{the time}} of the Apple IIc’s release, Apple {{announced}} an optional black and white (1-bit) LCD screen designed specifically for the machine called the Apple Flat Panel Display. While it was welcomed as a means of making the IIc more portable, it did not integrate well as a portable solution, not attaching in a secure or permanent manner and not able to <b>fold-over</b> face down. Instead, it sat atop the machine and connected via ribbon cable to a somewhat bulky rear port connector. Its main shortcoming was that it suffered from a very poor contrast and no backlighting, making it very difficult to view without a strong external light source. The display itself had an odd aspect ratio as well, making graphics look vertically squashed. A third-party company would later introduce a work-alike LCD screen called the C-Vue, which looked and functioned very much like Apple’s product, albeit with a reportedly slight improvement in viewability. Consequently, both sold poorly and had a very short market life span, making these displays fairly uncommon (and as a result, extremely rare today).|$|E

40|$|Recent {{testing in}} a cylindrical, {{comparative}} cryostat at the Cryogenics Test Laboratory {{has focused on}} various seam concepts for multilayer insulation systems. Three main types of seams were investigated: straight overlap, <b>fold-over,</b> and roll wrapped. Each blanket was comprised of 40 layer pairs of reflector and spacer materials. The total thickness was approximately 12. 5 -mm, giving an average layer density of 32 layers per centimeter. The blankets were tested at high vacuum, soft vacuum, and no vacuum using liquid nitrogen to maintain the cold boundary temperature at 77 K. Test results show that all three seam concepts are all close in thermal performance; however the <b>fold-over</b> method provides the lowest heat flux. For the first series of tests, seams were located 120 degrees around the circumference of the cryostat from the previous seam. This technique appears to have lessened the degradation of the blanket due to the seams. In a follow-on test, a 20 layer blanket was tested in a roll wrapped configuration and then cut {{down the side of}} the cylinder, taped together, and re-tested. This test result shows the thermal performance impact of having the seams all in one location versus having the seams clocked around the vessel.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the use of anatomically tailored hexagonal sampling for scan-time and error reduction in MRI. Materials and Methods: Anatomically tailored hexagonal MRI (ANTHEM), a method that combines hexagonal sampling with specific symmetry in anatomical geometry, is proposed. By using hexagonal sampling, aliasing artifacts are moved to regions where, {{due to the nature}} of the anatomy, aliasing is inconsequential. This can be used to either reduce scan time while maintaining spatial resolution or reduce residual errors in speedup techniques like UNFOLD and k-t BLAST/SENSE, which undersample k-space and unwrap <b>fold-over</b> artifacts during reconstruction. Computer simulations as well as phantom and volunteer studies were used to validate the theory.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a sequential experimentation approach for efficiently screening and tuning {{the parameters of}} a stochastic heuristic. Stochastic heuristics such as ant colony algorithms often use {{a large number of}} tuning parameters. Testing all combinations of these factors is prohibitive and inefficient. The sequential procedure recommended by this paper uses resolution IV fractional factorial designs with <b>fold-over</b> and centre points as an efficient way to screen the most important tuning parameters. The effects of the most important parameters are then modelled using a central composite design and optimised with standard numerical methods. All designs, their analyses and interpretation are illustrated using the Ant Colony System algorithm. The use of standard designs and methods has the benefit that the presented procedure can easily be followed with commercial software rather that relying on custom methodologies and tools that have only been developed in an academic context. Such a procedure has not been applied to ant colony algorithms before. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to character skinning where divergence-free vector fields induced by skeletal motion, describe the velocity of skin deformation. The joint transformations for a pose relative to a rest pose create a bend deformation field, resulting in pose-dependent or kinematic skin deformations, varying smoothly across joints. The bend deformation parameters are interactively controlled to capture the varying deformability of bone and other anatomic tissue within an overall <b>fold-over</b> free and volume-preserving skin deformation. Subsequently, we represent the dynamics of skeletal motion, tissue elasticity, muscular tension and the environment as forces that are mapped to vortices at tissue interfaces. A simplified Biot-Savart law in the context of elastic deformation recovers a divergence-free velocity field from the vorticity. Finally, we apply a new stable technique to efficiently integrate points along their deformation trajectories. Adding these dynamic forces over a window of time prior to a given pose provides a continuum of user controllable kinodynamic skinning. A comprehensive implementation using a typical animator workflow in Maya shows our approach to be effective for complex character skinning...|$|E
40|$|Black-blood fast spin-echo imaging is a {{powerful}} technique {{for the evaluation of}} cardiac anatomy. To avoid <b>fold-over</b> artifacts, using a sufficiently large field of view in phase-encoding direction is mandatory. The related oversampling affects scanning time and respiratory chest motion artifacts are commonly observed. The excitation of a volume that exclusively includes the heart without its surrounding structures may help to improve scan efficiency and minimize motion artifacts. Therefore, and by building on previously reported inner-volume approach, the combination of a black-blood fast spin-echo sequence with a two-dimensionally selective radiofrequency pulse is proposed for selective "local excitation" small field of view imaging of the heart. This local excitation technique has been developed, implemented, and tested in phantoms and in vivo. With this method, small field of view imaging of a user-specified region in the human thorax is feasible, scanning becomes more time efficient, motion artifacts can be minimized, and additional flexibility in the choice of imaging parameters can be exploited.

40|$|Common {{experimental}} practices suggest randomizing {{the order}} in which runs are performed. However, there may be situations in which randomization might not produce the most desirable order, especially in the presence of known trends. There has been research done on systematically designing experiments to be robust against trends. However, few studies address the additional dimensions that arise in nested designs such as split-plot designs. Split-plot designs have been used for many years in agricultural applications and are sometimes preferred where there are hard-to-change factors in industrial settings. There currently is no established methodology to produce split-plot designs that are robust to potential two-dimensional trends. The objective of this work is to develop a methodology to design run orders for two-level, split-plot (2 w × 2 s) designs that are robust or nearly robust against a set of trends. Two methods are developed in this work. A <b>fold-over</b> method that uses already established principles is extended for use in split-plot designs. The second method uses an integer linear programming approach to search for an optimal design that is resistant to specific trends.

40|$|Design of {{experiments}} (DOE) is an established methodology in research, development, manufacturing, and production for screening, optimization, and robustness testing. Two-level fractional factorial designs remain the preferred approach {{due to high}} information content while keeping the number {{of experiments}} low. These types of designs, however, have never been extended to a generalized multilevel reduced design type that would be capable to include both qualitative and quantitative factors. In this Article we describe a novel generalized fractional factorial design. In addition, it also provides complementary and balanced subdesigns analogous to a <b>fold-over</b> in two-level reduced factorial designs. We demonstrate how this design type can be applied with good results in three different applications in analytical chemistry including (a) multivariate calibration using microwave resonance spectroscopy for the determination of water in tablets, (b) stability study in drug product development, and (c) representative sample selection in clinical studies. This demonstrates the potential of generalized fractional factorial designs to be applied in many other areas of analytical chemistry where representative, balanced, and complementary subsets are required, especially when a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors at multiple levels exists...|$|E
40|$|Intermolecular multiple-quantum coherences (iMQCs) can refocus {{the phase}} {{dispersion}} caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities while preserving the chemical shift, {{so they have}} been applied to achieve high-resolution MR spectroscopy free of line broadening caused by susceptibility gradients. However, previous iMQC high-resolution methods all require two-dimensional spectra sampling of {{the full range of}} chemical shifts of solute evolutions in both F- 1 and F- 2 dimensions, resulting in a prolonged scanning time for data acquisition. In this work, sparse sampling in the t(1) dimension and subsequent <b>fold-over</b> correction are used to speed up the intermolecular zero-quantum coherence spectroscopy by up to 50 times on high-field MR systems. Furthermore, three types of spectra with homo-decoupling, original J-coupling constants, and doubled J-coupling constants respectively are obtained with manipulation of the t(1) period. The water suppression is also improved by the combined use of intermolecular double-quantum filter and excitation sculpting. The feasibilities of this group of new sequences are demonstrated by experiments using an agar gel phantom with an air bubble, in vitro pig brain tissues and an intact postmortem mudskipper.
