The 8:00 hour, which currently begins with the [...] "EyeOpener @ 8," [...] recaps the news from the first hour, leading into a brief summary of the morning's news headlines, before shifting focus to interviews and discussion (Ã  la Morning Joe) and lighter fare. True to Licht's [...] "no comedic weather" [...] promise, the show does not include any standalone national weather segments - this makes This Morning the only national morning news program {{on any of the}} [...] "Big Three" [...] networks not to include such a segment, although time is allotted for CBS affiliates to insert their own local weather forecasts (with national maps and forecasts or a text-only list of forecasts for individual cities nationwide provided for affiliates that do not insert their own weather updates, particularly those that do not have a news department). More recently, the program has utilized local meteorologists from CBS stations to provide the forecast during major severe weather events. The first half-hour also includes a 30-second segment following the local weather break, during which temperatures for various cities are scrolled alongside an <b>inset</b> <b>advertisement.</b> If additional weather coverage is warranted as part of a major news story, the program typically uses a meteorologist from one of CBS's owned-and-operated stations, most commonly Eric Fisher of Boston O&O WBZ-TV and Lonnie Quinn (former meteorologist for the program's Saturday edition) of flagship New York City O&O WCBS-TV for its weekday edition, and Ed Curran of Chicago O&O WBBM-TV for the Saturday edition.|$|E
