5|$|Following the war, in 1947, Anderson left Los Alamos and {{returned}} to teaching at Milwaukee-Downer College, but her involvement in atomic physics led to {{an interest in the}} health effects of radiation. In 1949, she left teaching to begin a career in <b>health</b> <b>physics.</b> At the <b>Health</b> <b>Physics</b> Division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, which was only five years old when she joined, she became the first chief of education and training. She spent her career helping to establish the new training program in <b>health</b> <b>physics,</b> teaching and advising graduate fellows in <b>health</b> <b>physics</b> from 1949.|$|E

5|$|Penney {{was anxious}} to secure the {{services}} of Titterton, who had recently emigrated to Australia, as he had worked on the American Trinity and Crossroads tests. Menzies asked the vice chancellor of the Australian National University, Sir Douglas Copland, to release Titterton to work on Operation Hurricane. Cockcroft also wanted assistance from Leslie Martin, the Department of Defence's Science Advisor, {{who was also a}} professor of physics at the University of Melbourne, to work in the <b>health</b> <b>physics</b> area. The two men knew each other from their time at Cambridge University before the war. After some argument, Martin was accepted as an official observer, as was W. A. S.

25|$|Some minutes later, a <b>health</b> <b>physics</b> {{response}} team arrived with radiation meters capable of measuring gamma radiation up to 500 R/hr—and full-body protective clothing. One health physicist and two firefighters ascended the stairs and, from the top, saw {{damage in the}} reactor room. With the meter showing maximum scale readings, they withdrew rather than approach the reactor more closely and risk further exposure.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, {{a lawsuit}} brought by nearly 1,200 people accused the {{government}} of negligence in atomic and/or nuclear weapons testing at the Nevada Test Site in the 1950s, which they said had caused leukemia and other cancers. Dr. Karl Z. Morgan, Director of <b>Health</b> <b>Physics</b> at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, testified that radiation protection measures in the tests were substandard to what was becoming known of best practices at the time.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s {{there was a}} large push at ORNL to develop nuclear-powered {{desalination}} plants where deserts met the sea to provide water. The project called Water for Peace was backed by John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and presented at a 1964 United Nations conference but increases in the cost of construction and public confidence in nuclear power falling caused the plan to fail. The <b>Health</b> <b>Physics</b> Research Reactor built in 1962 was used for radiation exposure experiments leading to more accurate dosage limits, dosimeters and improved radiation shielding.|$|E

25|$|After {{working for}} a year as {{instructors}} at the University of Denver, they joined the Manhattan Project, the effort during World War II to develop atomic bombs, at its Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. Nepotism rules prevented them both working in the same groups together, so while David worked on nuclear reactor design, Hall was assigned to Herbert Parker's <b>Health</b> <b>Physics</b> group, where she soon became head of its Special Studies section. Parker had her investigate the safety aspects of reactors, and she researched the hazards of inhaling plutonium.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, as {{she headed}} to a union {{negotiation}} meeting, Silkwood again {{tested positive for}} plutonium, although she had performed only paperwork duties that morning. She was given a more intensive decontamination. On November 7, {{as she entered the}} plant, she was found to be dangerously contaminated, even expelling contaminated air from her lungs. A <b>health</b> <b>physics</b> team accompanied her back to her home and found plutonium traces on several surfaces, especially in the bathroom and the refrigerator. When the house was later stripped and decontaminated, some of her property had to be destroyed. Silkwood, her boyfriend Drew Stephens, and her roommate Dusty Ellis, were sent to Los Alamos National Laboratory for in-depth testing {{to determine the extent of}} the contamination in their bodies.|$|E

500|$|George Koval {{was drafted}} into the United States Army in 1943, and was {{inducted}} into the Manhattan Project's Special Engineer Detachment. He was initially assigned to the Clinton Engineer Works, where his job as a <b>health</b> <b>physics</b> officer gave him access to much of the site. He began passing secrets relating to the production of polonium at Oak Ridge to the Soviet Union through his s GRU (Soviet military intelligence) [...] handler code-named [...] "Clyde". In 1945 Koval was transferred to Dayton. Again, his job as a <b>health</b> <b>physics</b> officer gave him wide access to the secret installation. In 2007 Russian President Vladimir Putin posthumously awarded Koval a gold star, making him a hero of the Russian Federation for his work as the GRU spy [...] "Delmar". Russian officials stated that the initiator for their Joe-1 bomb had been [...] "prepared to the recipe provided by Delmar".

Chronomics 1 thus resolves the otherwise impenetrable “normal range ” of physiological variation and leads to new, dynamic maps of normalcy and health in all fi elds of human endeavor, including, with <b>health</b> care, <b>physics,</b> chemistry, biology, and even sociology and economics. The authors plan to describe initiators of modern mapping of our make-up in time, with focus on mechanisms and applications.
