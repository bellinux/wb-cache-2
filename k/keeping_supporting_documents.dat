40|$|Entity {{retrieval}} {{finds the}} relevant results for a user’s information needs at a finer unit called “entity”. To retrieve such entity, people usually first locate a small set of <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> which contain answer entities, and then further detect the answer entities in this set. In the literature, people view the <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> as relevant documents, and their findings as a conventional document retrieval problem. In this paper, we will state that finding <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> {{and that of}} relevant documents, although sounds similar, have important differences. Further, we propose a logistic regression approach to find <b>support</b> <b>documents.</b> Our experiment {{results show that the}} logistic regression method performs significantly better than a baseline system that treat the <b>support</b> <b>document</b> finding as a conventional document retrieval problem...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{development}} of ship watch <b>keeping</b> <b>supporting</b> aids that will be useful for ship deck officers in recognizing navigational harmful obstacles such as sea marks and small floating objects on the sea. The developed watch <b>keeping</b> <b>supporting</b> aids is made up of four components; a composite video sensor to produce video signal, a laser distance measuring part, a Pan/Tilt part and a central control part. The system was installed in a ship in order to verify its performance of the recognition ability on the sea. The comparison was made between the recognition ability of the system and that of watch keeping deck officers’. The image from the watch <b>keeping</b> <b>supporting</b> system was found to be more recognizable than that of a binocular telescope within a 5 km distance. The newly suggested system is expected to be used to recognize small dangerous floating objects more easily when navigation deck officers have a duty of watch keeping for navigation especially near harbor area...|$|R
