50|$|A <b>subscriber</b> {{identity}} <b>module</b> or <b>subscriber</b> identification <b>module</b> (SIM) is {{an integrated}} circuit that {{is intended to}} securely store the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number and its related key, which are used to identify and authenticate subscribers on mobile telephony devices (such as mobile phones and computers). It is also possible to store contact information on many SIM cards. SIM cards are always used on GSM phones; for CDMA phones, they are only needed for newer LTE-capable handsets. SIM cards {{can also be used}} in satellite phones, computers, or cameras.|$|R

Under ideal operating conditions, the system can communicate over distances of 3.5 to 15 mi depending on the frequency using equipment with integrated antennas. Network operators can opt to install reflector dishes or Stinger antennas or to use Canopy models that accept external antennas at one or {{both ends of the}} link to increase coverage distance.|$|R

50|$|<b>ISDN</b> Digital <b>Subscriber</b> Line (IDSL) uses ISDN-based digital {{subscriber}} line technology to provide a data communication channel across existing copper telephone lines {{at a rate of}} 144 kbit/s, slightly higher than a bonded dual channel ISDN connection at 128kbit/s. The digital transmission bypasses the telephone company's central office equipment that handles analogue signals. IDSL uses the ISDN grade loop without Basic Rate Interface in ISDN transmission mode. The benefits of IDSL over ISDN are that IDSL provides always-on connections and transmits data via a data network rather than the carrier's voice network.|$|R
