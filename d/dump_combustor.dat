One major difference is the lack of rotating machinery (a turbine) after the combustor. The combustor exhaust is directly fed to a nozzle. This allows ramjet combustors to burn at a higher temperature. Another difference is that many ramjet combustors do not use liners like gas turbine combustors do. Furthermore, some ramjet <b>combustors</b> are <b>dump</b> <b>combustors</b> rather than a more conventional type. <b>Dump</b> <b>combustors</b> inject fuel and rely on recirculation generated by a large change in area in the combustor (rather than swirlers in many gas turbine combustors).

40|$|Combustion-{{acoustic}} instabilities {{occur when}} the acoustic energy increase due to the unsteady heat release of the flame {{is greater than the}} losses of acoustic energy from the system. The problem of combustion-acoustic instability is a concern in many devices for various reasons, as each device may have a unique mechanism causing unsteady heat release rates and many have unique boundary conditions. To accurately predict and quantify combustion-acoustic stabilities, the unsteady heat release rate and boundary conditions need to be accurately determined. The present review brings together work performed on a variety of practical combustion devices.

In an effort to improve their systems, the gas-turbine industry is interested in understanding and controlling combustion instabilities as well as reducing pollutant production. To understand the dynamics inherent in a combustion system, information about the flow field behavior is required. Because of a scarcity of available experimental or numerical results for full-scale gas-turbine combustors, we decided to use numerical simulations to provide the required information about the flow field dynamics. The ability of the numerical simulations to reproduce unstable behavior in combustion environments will be presented. The investigation of the flow field dynamics has been conducted for three test cases; a planar heat source in a tube, premixed flow in a <b>dump</b> <b>combustor,</b> and premixed and diffusion flames in a full-scale gas turbine combustor. The numerically determined unsteady acoustic modes will be shown to compare well with theory and experiments. An investigation of the local heat release response to an unsteady flow field is conducted for incorporation into an approximate analysis method.

40|$|Combustion {{instability}} in premixed combustors mostly arises {{due to the}} coupling between heat release rate dynamics and system acoustics. It is crucial to understand the instability mech-anisms to design reliable, high efficiency, low emission gas turbine combustors. In this thesis, elementary processes acting {{as a source of}} unsteady heat release rate are described. These el-ementary processes are acoustic wave-flame interactions, flame-vortex interactions, equivalence ratio fluctuations, flame-wall interactions and the unsteady stretch rate. To investigate the flame-vortex interaction mechanism, a parametric study is performed in single and double expansion <b>dump</b> <b>combustors.</b> 2 -D simulations are performed using the random vortex method combined with thin flame model of premixed combustion. The inlet velocity of the combustor is forced sinusoidally at various amplitudes and frequencies, and the heat release rate response is evalu-ated. It is shown that the heat release rate dynamics are governed by the cyclical formation of a large wake vortex and its interaction with the flame. Maximum heat release rate in a cycle is reached a short time after the breakup of the vortex, which causes rapid burning of the reactants trapped within the structure.

40|$|Experimental {{results for}} instabilities in <b>dump</b> <b>combustors</b> have long shown the {{presence}} {{of some sort of}} hysteresis, {{in the vicinity of the}} stability boundary defined by flow speed and mixture ratio. This note reports measurements of the precise character of hysteresis loops found when the mixture ratio is varied with flow speed held constant. The upper branch represents relatively high amplitude limit cycles and the lower branch contains low level oscillations possibly driven by stochastic sources within the chamber. Existence of the hysteresis loops suggests the possibility of causing a transition from the upper unstable branch to the lower stable branch. This has been accomplished by injecting short pulses of secondary fuel either in the boundary layer upstream of the dump plane or in the recirculation zone. Only a single pulse is required if its flow rate and width are suitably chosen. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a novel method of active control of combustion instabilities if hysteresis is present, apparently the first example of true nonlinear control of combustor dynamics. The main advantage is the small amount of secondary fuel required. More generally, this work illustrates the value, for active control, of understanding the dynamics of the uncontrolled system...|$|R
40|$|A {{feedback}} free fluidic oscillator {{was designed}} and integrated into a single element rocket combustor {{with the goal of}} suppressing longitudinal combustion instabilities. The fluidic oscillator uses internal fluid dynamics to create an unsteady outlet jet at a specific frequency. An array of nine fluidic oscillators was tested to mimic modulated secondary oxidizer injection into the <b>combustor</b> <b>dump</b> plane. The <b>combustor</b> has a coaxial injector that uses gaseous methane and decomposed hydrogen peroxide with an overall O/F ratio of 11. 7. A sonic choke plate on an actuator arm allows for continuous adjustment of the oxidizer post acoustics enabling the study of a variety of instability magnitudes. The fluidic oscillator unsteady outlet jet performance is compared against equivalent steady jet injection and a baseline design with no secondary oxidizer injection. At the most unstable operating conditions, the unsteady outlet jet saw a 67 % reduction in the instability pressure oscillation magnitude when compared to the steady jet and baseline data. Additionally, computational fluid dynamics analysis of the combustor gives insight into the flow field interaction of the fluidic oscillators.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2011. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Paul J. Strykowski. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 253 pages, appendix A. Countercurrent shear flow control {{has been shown}} as an effective method of increasing volumetric heat release within a <b>dump</b> <b>combustor</b> due {{to an increase in}} turbulence, specifically the large turbulent structures present in the flow field. Limitations in a previous suction-derived control mechanism motivated developing this fluidic control scheme using a secondary momentum-driven source. Multiple momentum-driven facilities were developed and explored; two facilities that showed promise are presented and the results of the isothermal studies show increases in turbulence and three-dimensionality. Momentum-driven countercurrent shear acts to increase the shear within the flow while simultaneously decreasing the convective velocity, thus resulting in elevated peak turbulence levels and increases in both the scale of the turbulent structures and the cross-stream averaged turbulence levels. The effects of this enhanced countercurrent shear leads to a globally unstable flow field that is quite advantageous in combustion control. Linear stability theory was used to provide guidance into the global flow fields created within these facilities, all of which contain multiple unstable profiles, each having their own stability parameters. Dissecting the flow created into a series of unstable profiles and using knowledge of the stability of these parallel flow profiles provides insight into the global stability of the flows created and how these flows can be used for fluidic control within a <b>dump</b> <b>combustor.</b> Future studies will investigate the confinement of this flow field and will explore the use of momentum-driven countercurrent shear within a <b>dump</b> <b>combustor</b> under premixed combustion.

40|$|Active control {{mechanisms}} are being examined for lean premix combustion applications, such as gas turbine generators. Lean premix combustors {{are susceptible to}} large combustion oscillations, particularly when driven very lean to achieve low NOx. While past design work has been focussed on understanding {{the source of the}} oscillation and modifying the combustor to avoid such oscillations, commercial combustion designers have more recently considered applying new control elements. As part of the U. S. Department of Energy`s Advanced Gas Turbine Systems Program, the Morgantown Energy Technology Center is investigating various active control techniques. This paper presents results from experiments studying the effect of pilot fuel modulation on combustor oscillation and pollutant emissions for a pilot stabilized <b>dump</b> swirl <b>combustor,</b> typical of gas turbine combustors. The results show that a significant level of attenuation can be achieved in the combustor pressure oscillation (50 to 90 percent) while only moderately affecting pollutant emissions. The control mechanism producing the attenuation is shown to be purely chemical in nature, rather than fluid mechanic. In addition, the frequency region over which control is obtained is shown {{to be related to the}} recirculation zone purge time. For this reason, control can be achieved at control frequencies much lower than the frequency of oscillation...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the use of {{naturally}} occurring optical emissions, specifically chemi-luminescence, for sensing applications in active control and health monitoring of combustors. First, monitoring local equivalence ratio (φ), at the reaction zone, has been demonstrated using the ratio of CH to OH chemi-luminescence. This ratio (CH*/OH*) increases monotonically with equivalence ratio, and the dependence on equivalence ratio {{has been shown to be}} a universal function for combustor configurations ranging from unconfined jet flames to swirl and <b>dump</b> stabilized <b>combustors.</b> There is essentially no difference between the CH*/OH * ratio for methane and natural (city) gas, but the ratio has a lower sensitivity to φ for n-heptane compared to methane or natural gas. The ratio was found to increase almost linearly with pressure for natural gas/methane combustion above 3 atm. Second, chemiluminescence emission from the combustor was used to detect precursor events to blowout, using a robust thresholding method. This method was shown to be successful in jet flames and swirl/dump stabilized combustors using premixed methane/air and nonpremixed Jet-A/air. This method gives the kind of information on proximity to blowout that can be used by an active control system to prevent lean blowout in low NOx turbine engine combustors...|$|R
40|$|The study {{characterizes the}} {{behavior}} of a premixed swirl stabilized <b>dump</b> plane <b>combustor</b> flame near its lean blow-out (LBO) limit in terms of CH* chemiluminiscence intensity and observable flame color variations {{for a wide range of}} equivalence ratio, flow rates and degree of premixing (characterized by premixing length, Lfuel). LPG and pure methane are used as fuel. We propose a novel LBO prediction strategy based solely on the flame color. It is observed that as the flame approaches LBO, its color changes from reddish to blue. This observation is found to be valid for different levels of fuel-air premixing achieved by changing the available mixing length of the air and the fuel upstream of the dump plane although the flame dynamics were significantly different. Based on this observation, the ratio of the intensities of red and blue components of the flame as captured by a color CCD camera was used as a metric for detecting the proximity of the flame to LBO. Tests were carried out for a wide range of air flow rates and using LPG and CH 4 as fuel. For all the operating conditions and both fuels tested, this ratio was found to monotonically decrease as LBO was approached. Moreover, the value of this ratio was within a small range close to LBO for all the cases investigated. This makes the ratio suitable as a metric for LBO detection at all levels of premixing...|$|R

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{analytical model}} is presented for calculating the longitudinal acoustic modes of idealized "dump-type" ramjet engines. The geometry considered is the coaxial flow type with {{the inlet flow}} opening to the combustor at a simple dump plane. Since the frequencies are very low, the dominant modes are the one-dimensional longitudinal modes and allow the predictions to be extended to more complicated geometries (such as side <b>dump</b> <b>combustors)</b> with good success. A plane flame has been studied and incorporated into the combustor model where the flame is allowed to move or oscillate in the combustor. This provides three mechanisms of interaction at the flame sheet: change in mean temperature in the combustor, energy conversion at the sheet due to upstream fluctuations, and fluctuating heat release. A supersonic inlet upstream contains a shock wave in its diffuser section while the downstream exit is terminated by a choked nozzle. The linear coupling of the acoustic and entropy waves at the inlet shock, flame sheet, and exit nozzle along with acoustic admittances at the inlet and exit are combined to determine {{the stability of the}} system as well as the acoustic modes. Since the acoustic and entropy waves travel at different velocities, the geometry is a critical factor in determining stability. Typical values of the admittances will produce damped solutions when the entropy is neglected, but, as the ratio of the entropy to acoustic fluctuations is increased, the coupling can either feed acoustic energy into or out of different modes independently. This transfer of energy has a destabilizing or stabilizing effect on the acoustic modes of the system depending on the relative phases between the acoustic and entropy waves. In the linear case, the entropy and acoustics are decoupled in the flow field. All linear coupling occurs at the boundary conditions. For cases where the entropy fluctuations are of the same order of magnitude as the pressure oscillations and the coupling is of comparable order, the linear stability of the acoustic field is strongly dependent upon the entropy fluctuations. The linear acoustics are predominantly governed by the boundary conditions; thus it is imperative that the entire system of inlet, combustor, and exit be considered together to determine the characteristic eigenvalues (resonant frequencies) and eigenfunctions (mode shapes). In addition, there are two modes of acoustic pressure oscillations: the classical acoustic mode and the entropy-induced mode of pressure oscillation. The nonlinear case treats the quadratic nonlinear fluid mechanic interactions in the coupling of two acoustic modes. The result is that the nonlinear acoustic-entropy interactions are much smaller than the acoustic-acoustic interactions for this case. Hence, the nonlinear acoustic field is influenced by the nonuniform entropy only by its dependence upon the linear solution which can be strongly dependent upon the entropy. The energy in the acoustics of this model is controlled by the energy loss (gain) at the boundaries balanced with the energy gain (loss) at the flame front. Acoustic energy is typically lost at both the inlet and exit, but fluctuating entropy waves convecting with the mean flow velocity that impinge upon a choked nozzle generate acoustic waves that can, under the proper conditions, feed acoustic energy into the system. In addition, the Rayleigh condition for driving the system with a fluctuating heat release can also contribute to the stability of the system. The plane flame mechanism also contributes to the acoustic energy from the interaction of entropy and acoustic waves at a flame sheet. This allows a systematic study of the influence of entropy-acoustic wave interactions on the linear stability and modes of this combustor system...|$|R
40|$|Gaseous methane and 90 % {{hydrogen}} peroxide at an equivalence ratio of 0. 8 {{were used to}} study combustion instabilities in the region where the system transitioned from stable to unstable combustion. A variable geometry unstable rocket combustor was used at a chamber pressure of 210 psi. The combustor consists of a coaxial shear injector and a simple <b>dump</b> plane <b>combustor.</b> The oxidizer injector is mounted on a translating shaft that allows the oxidizer post length to be changed from a ½ wave resonator to a ¼ wave resonator {{during the course of}} a test. The oxidizer injector was translated forward and backward to check for hysteresis effects. A series of tests with the oxidizer injector fixed at a given location were also performed. The results indicate that the translating post moves slow enough compared to the frequency of the pressure oscillations that the system can be considered “quasi-steady. ” High frequency pressure data from the oxidizer and fuel manifold, oxidizer post, and various chamber locations were obtained at a scan rate of at least 100 kHz. The physics of the combustion process were examined to determine whether or not they remained constant as the system transitioned from marginally stable to highly unstable combustion. The primary frequency of combustion, pressure mode shape, and phase angle between pressure at the head end of the chamber and pressure at the aft end of the chamber were found to change as the system transitioned to unstable combustion. The first five inches of the combustion chamber were replaceable with a quartz/acrylic housing. This allowed the combustion at the head end of the combustor to be filmed with a high speed camera. Line of sight optical images were obtained at scan rate of 10 kHz. Light intensity was used as an estimation of local unsteady heat release. The phase angles and Rayleigh index between the unsteady light and unsteady pressure oscillations were calculated and driving and damping regions identified. ...|$|R

Two configurations, which correspond to two levels of H 2 enrichment in the CH 4 /H 2 fuel blend, are investigated. Experiments show that high H 2 concentrations promote M flame shapes, whereas V flame shapes are observed for lower values of H 2 enrichment. In both cases, non-reacting and reacting flow Large Eddy Simulation (LES) calculations were performed.

All temperatures of solid walls of the experimental setup including the <b>combustor</b> <b>dump</b> plane, the injector central rod tip, the combustor sidewalls and the quartz windows were also characterized. Assuming a fully adiabatic combustion chamber, LES always predicts an M flame shape and does not capture the V to M shape transition observed in the experiments when the hydrogen concentration in the fuel blend is increased.

Despite its known limitations, the most the widely used model {{is still the}} standard k-ε model. The objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate the performance of two-equation turbulence models applied to a confined swirling flow. Numerical {{modeling of}} an axis-symmetric confined sudden expansion, followed by a contraction with the assumption of steady flow and an incompressible fluid, has been conducted. The flow field is what can be expected in simplified <b>dump</b> gas turbine <b>combustor</b> geometry. In this investigation, three different swirl cases were considered: no swirl, moderate swirl (no central re-circulation zone) and strong swift (a central recirculation zone occurring). The models investigated were: the standard k-ε model, a curvature-modified k-ε model, Chen's k-ε model, a cubic non-linear k-ε model, the standard k-ω model and the Shear Stress Transport (SST) k-ω model. The results show that almost all models were able to predict the major impact of the moderate swirl: reduced outer re-circulation lengths and retardation of the axial velocity on the center-line. However, the Chen k-ε model and the SST k-ω model were found to better reproduce the mean velocity field and the turbulent kinetic energy field from the measurements. For a strong swift, a large re-circulation zone is formed along the center-line, which the standard k-ε model and the modified k-ε model fail to predict. However, the shape and size of the re-circulation zone differ strongly between the models. At this swirl number, the performances of all models were, without exception, worse than for the lower swift numbers.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} flame transfer function between flow disturbances and heat release oscillations in lean, premixed combustors. This research effort was motivated {{by the fact that}} modern gas turbines, operating fuel-lean to minimize exhaust emissions, are susceptible to self-excited combustion oscillations. These instabilities generally occur when the unsteady combustion process couples with the acoustic modes of the combustion chamber. The resultant flow and structural vibrations can substantially reduce hot section part life. As such, avoiding operating regimes where high dynamics occur often requires operating at lower power outputs and/or higher pollutant emissions than the turbine is otherwise capable. This work demonstrated nonlinearities in the chemiluminescence response at large amplitude velocity oscillations in a turbulent, swirling flame. It is observed that the nonlinear flame response can exhibit a variety of behaviors, both {{in the shape of the}} response curve and the forcing amplitude at which nonlinearity is first observed depending on the operating conditions of the combustor. The phase between the flow oscillations and heat release is also seen to have substantial amplitude dependence. In addition, the interactions between the fundamental frequency and the higher and subharmonics of the measured signals can significantly influence the flame as well as the frequency response of the system. The nonlinear flame dynamics are governed by different mechanisms in different frequency and flowrate regimes. Three mechanisms, vortex rollup, unsteady flame liftoff, and parametric instability, are identified to influence the nonlinear flame response in these combustors. Analysis of the results shows that the mechanisms responsible for nonlinearity in the flame response are influenced by the Strouhal number, the mean velocity at the <b>combustor</b> <b>dump</b> plane, and the ratio of the oscillating velocity amplitude to the laminar flame speed.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} a four-inlet side <b>dump</b> <b>combustor</b> configuration suitable for a boosted ramjet has been carried out. Combustor characteristics were obtained from water tunnel simulation and direct-connect combustion tests. A perspex, one third scale, model of the ramjet combustor was tested in a water rig. Flow field visualisation was accomplished by employing the hydrogen bubble streak technique. The best placement of the cruciform flameholder relative to the air inlet plane was determined. A similar combustor was made from stainless steel and tested in a combustor test rig. Combustion efficiency, cold and hot total pressure loss and ignition characteristics and lean blow-out limits were obtained. A design methodology for ramjet combustors has been arrived at...|$|E
