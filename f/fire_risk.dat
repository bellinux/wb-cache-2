5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} crew of the train had not been advised that there was a raised <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> at the time. WCRC was found not to have co-operated fully with the investigation. The ADC found that WCRC's Safety Management System was deficient due to confusion over whether or not {{the crew of the}} train had been informed of the increased <b>fire</b> <b>risk.</b> WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to try to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC found that this was in breach of WCRC's Safety Management System. WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC found that this instruction was prejudicial to the safe operation of WCRC's Safety Management System. The instruction was later rescinded. WCRC was also found to be in breach of its Track Access Contract.|$|E

5|$|The first {{deliveries}} of the Chevrolet Volt in Europe {{took place}} on November 30, 2011, to the U.S. Embassy in France. Distribution of the Opel Ampera to dealerships began in December 2011, but deliveries to customers were delayed until February 2012 because Opel decided {{to wait until the}} NHTSA completed its investigation of the Volt's battery <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> after a crash.

5|$|Welders {{are also}} often exposed to {{dangerous}} gases and particulate matter. GMAW produces smoke containing particles {{of various types}} of oxides, {{and the size of}} the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. Additionally, carbon dioxide and ozone gases can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate. Furthermore, because the use of compressed gases in GMAW pose an explosion and <b>fire</b> <b>risk,</b> some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace.|$|E

Controversies regarding the Volt include {{the extent to}} which the U.S. federal government may have participated in the Volt’s development, which continued through General Motors' 2009 government-led bankruptcy, and concerns about the battery pack <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> following a crash test that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) performed on a Volt in 2011. At the completion of its investigation NHTSA concluded that no discernible defect trend exists.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} the criteria and attributes for assessing <b>fire</b> <b>risks</b> in buildings. Using the Analytical Hierarchy Method (AHP) a survey questionnaire was developed {{based on the}} identified criteria and attributes of <b>fire</b> <b>risks</b> for heritage buildings in Malaysia. The survey questionnaire was administered to consultant, Fire Rescue Department (FRDM) personnel, maintenance professionals and insurance professional. The data were analysed using ExperChoice 2000 software. The result of the research is the weightage for each criterion and its respective attributes...|$|R

5|$|The pilot {{operated}} the controls at the bows of the gondola, {{forward of the}} engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder engine running at 1,000rpm, mounted centrally in the gondola, drove two 2.6-metre (8.5ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000–1,200rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The exhaust pipe, below {{the rear of the}} gondola, was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the <b>fire</b> <b>risk.</b> The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280L (61.6gal), was housed below the gondola within a pyramid of steel tubing that was designed to protect the gondola and the propellers during landing.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{were unable}} to enter the silos as OSHA ruled them to be too {{hazardous}} after the explosion. They were only able to access the area after the silos were demolished. By the time this took place, {{four months after the}} disaster, investigators believed that the explosion started in a basement area beneath the silos, from which sugar was fed up to the packaging building on conveyor belts. The factory's outdated construction materials and methods are believed to have contributed to the severity of the blaze. The ceiling was of wooden tongue and groove design. The creosote used throughout was known as “fat lighter,” because of the <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> it posed. Interviews of Imperial Sugar employees conducted by OSHA uncovered a lack of training, as 40 of the workers reported never receiving training on how to exit the building in an emergency. Only five employees recalled having a fire drill.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-pressure}} oxygen {{atmosphere was}} consistent with that {{that had been used}} successfully in the Mercury and Gemini programs. The pressure before launch was deliberately greater than ambient in order to drive out the nitrogen-containing air and replace it with pure oxygen, and also to seal the plug door hatch cover. During launch, the pressure would have been gradually reduced to the in-flight level of , providing sufficient oxygen for the astronauts to breathe while reducing the <b>fire</b> <b>risk.</b> The Apollo 1 crew had successfully tested this procedure with their spacecraft in the Operations and Checkout Building altitude (vacuum) chamber on October 18 and 19, 1966, and the backup crew of Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham had repeated it on December 30. The investigation board noted that, during these tests, the Command Module had been fully pressurized with pure oxygen four times, for a total of six hours and fifteen minutes, {{two and a half hours}} longer than it had been during the plugs-out test.|$|E

5|$|Welders {{are often}} exposed to {{dangerous}} gases and particulate matter. Processes like flux-cored arc welding and shielded {{metal arc welding}} produce smoke containing particles of various types of oxides. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. This is because smaller particles {{have the ability to}} cross the blood–brain barrier. Fumes and gases, such as carbon dioxide, ozone, and fumes containing heavy metals, can be dangerous to welders lacking proper ventilation and training. Exposure to manganese welding fumes, for example, even at low levels (<0.2 mg/m3), may lead to neurological problems or to damage to the lungs, liver, kidneys, or central nervous system. Nano particles can become trapped in the alveolar macrophages of the lungs and induce pulmonary fibrosis. The use of compressed gases and flames in many welding processes poses an explosion and <b>fire</b> <b>risk.</b> Some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air, and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{building}} codes debate, an expert panel recommended in 2010 that the state government ban housing in the highest <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> areas, which {{are some of the most}} dangerous in the world. Michael Buxton, a professor at RMIT University, said that after the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires the government bought back tens of thousands of lots across the Dandenong Ranges because they were in extremely high <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> areas; he backed another similar large-scale buyback scheme to move people away from unacceptably high risk areas.|$|E

40|$|Heritage {{buildings}} were generally constructed {{without regard for}} <b>fire</b> <b>risks</b> or the requirements for fire protection, as are obligatory in new constructions. When a heritage building undergoes a change to its original function, improvements to the building’s fire safety are necessary {{to meet the needs}} of possible increases in occupancy loads and to account for <b>fire</b> <b>risks</b> related to the new usage. This research focuses on <b>fire</b> safety <b>risks,</b> <b>fire</b> protection and safety systems as well as the rules and regulations that an adaptive reuse heritage shop house is bound to when transitioning to a sleeping accommodation, which, in this case, means becoming a hotel. In this research, six heritage shop houses were chosen as case studies. The objectives of this research were to evaluate current fire emergency plans as well as to identify and assess possible fire hazards created by adaptive reuse of heritage shop houses to sleeping accommodations in Penang through a series of observations and interviews. The results of the research show that most of the {{buildings were}} provided with inadequate fire safety systems...|$|R
