Preface: Tucson Water, the City of Tucson, funded {{two phases}} {{of a project}} to {{evaluate}} the potential of <b>dry</b> <b>wells</b> in the Tucson area to pollute ground water. The first phase entailed inventorying existing <b>dry</b> <b>wells</b> {{in the area and}} assessing pollutants in settling chamber sediment in candidate wells from the three major classes of wells, industrial, commercial, and residential. The second phase of the study involved detailed investigations at "worst case" industrial and commercial sites. Similar studies at a residential (apartment complex) site were funded by Pima County Department of Transportation and Flood Control District.

Khan hired butchers, who murdered the captives with cleavers; the butchers left when it seemed that all the captives had been killed. However, a few women and {{children}} had managed to survive by hiding under the other dead bodies. It was agreed that the bodies of the victims would be thrown down a <b>dry</b> <b>well</b> by some sweepers. The next morning the rebels arrived to dispose of the bodies and they found that three women who were still alive, and also three stark naked children aged between four and seven years old [...] The surviving women were cast into the well by the sweepers, who had also been told to strip the corpses. The sweepers then threw the three little boys into the well one at a time, the youngest first. Some victims, among them small children, were therefore buried alive in a heap of butchered corpses.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 19th century, {{likely due to}} The Great Hunger, {{the name}} Tubridy spread out from County Clare into the New World as well as across the Irish Sea to Great Britain.

In the myth specifically related to the Tubridys the tale says, a Spaniard who survived the sinking was swept ashore the West Coast of Clare, was given refuge by a woman surnamed O'Riada, hiding in a <b>dry</b> <b>well</b> near her house. As the man could not speak either English or Irish, he was known as [...] "O'Tiobraide", meaning in English [...] "of the well of Reidy(O'Riada)".

2500|$|Though locally {{known as}} the 'Palace of Shuja', the Mughal Prince, it is {{inferred}} to have been built earlier by Nawab Mir Qasim Ali, who also ruled from Munger. The palace is bounded by high rise walls on three sides and the Ganges river {{on the west side}}. As in any palace of the Mughals, it consisted of a Khas Mahal or 'Zanana Palace', the 'Diwane-I-Am' or Public Audience Hall and the Tope-Khana or Armoury (made of [...] thick walls) (now a dormitory). [...] There was also a mosque {{on the west side of}} the palace, now in ruins, but used as storehouse. There was a Turkish bath (hammam) and a dressing room to the west of the present day jailer's office. An interesting feature noted below the floor of the mosque is a <b>dry</b> <b>well</b> or pit of [...] depth, which leads to several underground tunnels running in different directions. The well was, in earlier times, connected to the river through an opening, which has since been shored up. The Khas Mahal of the palace and the Public Audience Hall inside the fort, which are now seen mostly in ruins, are used as a jail and a school for the convicts.|$|E
