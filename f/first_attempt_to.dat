5|$|Project Cirrus was the <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> {{modify a}} hurricane. It was a {{collaboration}} of the General Electric Corporation, the US Army Signal Corps, the Office of Naval Research, and the US Air Force. After several preparations, and initial skepticism by government scientists, the <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> modify a hurricane began on October 13, 1947 on a hurricane that was heading {{west to east}} and out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Another {{area where}} the Antiquary led was in {{recording}} folklore and folktales. Its publication of Punjab folktales was the <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> classify the events on which folk tales were based and the pioneering work on north Indian folklore of William Crooke and Pandit Ram Gharib Chaube was printed in its pages.|$|E
5|$|Edmund Thomas Coleman, an Englishman who {{resided in}} Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and {{a veteran of}} the Alps, made the <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> ascend the {{mountain}} in 1866.

5|$|The cantata was {{the last}} chorale cantata of the cycle, {{possibly}} because Bach lost a librettist who had inspired him. The work was chosen to open the <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> publish Bach's complete works, a century after his death.|$|E

5|$|On June 2, C Company {{moved to}} capture Hill 543 {{near the village}} of Chipo-ri. The hill was {{protected}} by heavily entrenched Chinese infantry as well as mortars {{at the top of the}} hill. During their <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> advance up the hill, the company took heavy casualties, and the 3rd Platoon leader was mortally wounded. Charlton took command of the platoon and reorganized it for another attack. Heavy fire eventually forced the company back down the hill.|$|E

The project was cancelled in October 2010, soon before the closure of Propaganda Games.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s {{also saw}} the birth of Cyc, the <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> attack the commonsense {{knowledge}} problem directly, by creating a massive database that would contain all the mundane facts that the average person knows. Douglas Lenat, who started and led the project, argued {{that there is no}} shortcut ― the only way for machines to know the meaning of human concepts is to teach them, one concept at a time, by hand. The project was not expected to be completed for many decades.|$|E
5|$|The Who's <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> {{record the}} song was at the Record Plant on W 44 Street, New York City, on 16 March 1971.

5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> build {{a modern}} trade route {{through the area}} is {{credited}} to William Jackson Palmer, founder of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D). Palmer started a project in 1880 to make {{what had been a}} local railroad from Colorado into a transcontinental railroad empire. This would mean a second transcontinental railroad would be built across Utah. This would also place the D in competition with the First Transcontinental Railroad, then operated by Union Pacific Railroad and Central Pacific Railroad.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> codify {{the laws}} of the medieval state on the {{territory}} of what is now Belarus (the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) took the form of Statutes of Lithuania, with the First Statute in power in 1529. The document, written in Old Belarusian language, fulfilled the role of the supreme law of the land.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> {{measure the}} {{diameter}} of Triton was made by Gerard Kuiper in 1954. He obtained a value of 3,800km. Subsequent measurement attempts arrived at values ranging from 2,500 to 6,000km, or from slightly smaller than the Moon (3474.2km) to nearly half {{the diameter of}} Earth. Data from the approach of Voyager 2 to Neptune on August 25, 1989, led to a more accurate estimate of Triton's diameter (2,706km).|$|E

5|$|Acting on James Bevel's {{call for}} a march from Selma to Montgomery, King, Bevel, and the SCLC, in partial {{collaboration}} with SNCC, attempted to organize the march to the state's capital. The <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> march on March 7, 1965, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day {{has become known as}} Bloody Sunday and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the Civil Rights Movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King's nonviolence strategy. King, however, was not present.|$|E
5|$|As in {{most other}} parts of the world, the decades {{following}} the World War II were relatively free from football violence and the supporter culture did not change much. Swedish football culture started to change in the late 1960s, becoming heavily inspired and influenced by the English supporter culture. This flourished in the 1970s and 1980s, giving birth {{to some of the most}} well-known Swedish supporters clubs, AIK's Black Army, Djurgårdens IF's Blue Saints (later Järnkaminerna), and IFK Göteborg's supporters club, Änglarna (the Angels). The <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> found an IFK supporters club was made in 1969, but interest diminished when IFK Göteborg were relegated from the highest league the following year. The supporters club was not re-founded until 1973, which is considered the year of foundation of Änglarna.|$|E
5|$|Basil II's <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> {{overwhelm}} {{the defenders of}} the pass was unsuccessful and his army was unable {{to pass through the}} valley, which was defended by 15,000–20,000 Bulgarians. Despite the difficulties the Byzantine Emperor did not abandon the attack. He ordered his general Nicephorus Xiphias to manoeuvre his troops around the high Belasitsa mountain and surround the Bulgarians, while he continued the assaults on the wall. Xiphias led his troops along a steep path that led him into the Bulgarians' rear. On July 29, Xiphias attacked the guards, trapping them in the valley. The Bulgarian soldiers abandoned their towers to face this new threat and Basil was able to break through the front line and destroy the wall.|$|E
