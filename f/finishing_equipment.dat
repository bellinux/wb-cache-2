5000|$|Natural {{stone is}} one of the most {{commonly}} used materials in countertops. Natural stone or dimension stone slabs (e.g. granite) are shaped using cutting and <b>finishing</b> <b>equipment</b> in the shop of the fabricator. The edges are commonly put on by hand-held routers, grinders, or CNC equipment. If the stone has a highly variegated pattern, the stone may be laid out in final position in the shop for the customer's inspection, or the stone slabs may be selected by experienced inspectors. Emerging technology allows for virtual stone placement on a computer. Exact photographs can now be taken which allow for the integration of a dxf file to lay on top of a stone image. Multiple slabs of material may be used in this layout process. Then the countertop assembly is installed on the job site by professionals.Commonly, initial countertop fabrication takes place at or near the quarry of origin, with blocks being sawn to thickness and then machined into standard widths (600mm and upwards), before being surface polished and edged.This method removes the need to ship waste material, and reduces the time needed to prepare client orders. This practice is called [...] "cut to size"A wide range of details may be pre-machined by the fabricator, allowing for installation of different sinks and cooker designs. A common drawback to natural stone is the need for sealing to prevent harboring of bacteria and/or fluids that may cause staining. In recent years oleophobic impregnators have been introduced as an alternative to surface sealers. With the advent of impregnators the frequency of sealing has been cut down to once every five to ten years on most materials.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{engineering}} {{business models}} in aerospace manufacture and deliver <b>finished</b> <b>equipment</b> to the customer. Service provision is typically limited to procedural documentation and providing spare parts {{to the end}} user. Commercial pressures have resulted in end users structuring their own core business activities resulting in the need for original equipment manufac-turer (OEM) to integrate and manage support service activities {{in partnership with the}} customer to deliver the availability of the equipment. This improves the probability of commercial success for the OEM through shared operational risks while re-ducing the cost of ownership for the customer. This paper applies four of the seven attributes of value co-creation (AVCs) developed by Ng, Nudurupati, and Tasker (2009) required for an integrated and partnered approach to service provision be-tween the OEM and the customer. It also shows how these are supported through applying digital manufacturing methods for the design and implementation of complex service processes. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} project are: (1) To determine the feasibility of proportioning, mixing, placing and finishing a dense portland cement concrete in a bridge floor using conventional mixing, placing and <b>finishing</b> <b>equipment.</b> (2) To determine the economics, longevity, maintenance performance and protective qualities of a dense portland cement concrete bridge floor when using a high rangewater reducing admixture. The purpose of a high range water reducing admixture is to produce a dense, high quality concrete at a low water-cement ratio witj adequate workability. A low water-cement ratio contributes greatly to increased strength. The normal 7 day strength of untreated concrete would be expected i n 3 days using a superplasticizer. A dense concrete also has the desirable properties of excellent durability and reduced permeability. It is felt that a higher quality, denser, higher strength portland cement concrete can be produced and placed, using conventional equipment, {{by the addition of}} a high range water reducing admixture. Such a dense concrete, w i t h a water/cement ratio of approximately 0. 30 to 0. 35, would be expected to be much less permeable and thus retard the intrusion of chloride. With care and attention given to obtaining the design cover over steel (2...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{high range}} water reducer in bridge floors was {{initiated}} by an Iowa Highway Research Board project (HR- 192) in 1977 for two basic reasons. One {{was to determine the}} feasibility of using a high range water reducer (HRWR) in bridge floor concrete using conventional concrete proportioning, transporting and <b>finishing</b> <b>equipment.</b> The second was to determine the performance and protective qualities against chloride intrusion of a dense concrete bridge floor by de-icing agents used on Iowa's highways during winter months. This project was basically intended to overcome some problems that developed in the original research project. The problems alluded to are the time limits from batching to finishing; use of a different type of finishing machine; need for supplemental vibration {{on the surface of the}} concrete during the screeding operation and difficulty of texturing. The use of a double oscillating screed finishing machine worked well and supplemental vibration on one of the screeds was not needed. The limit of 45 minutes from batching the concrete to placement on the deck was verified. This is a maximum when the HRWR is introduced at the batch plant. The problem of texturing was not solved completely but is similar to our problems on the dense "Iowa System" overlay used on bridge deck repair projects. This project reinforced some earlier doubts about using truck transit mixers for mixing and transporting concrete containing HRWR when introduced at the batch plant...|$|E
