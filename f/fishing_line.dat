5|$|Because {{titanium}} is {{resistant to}} corrosion by sea water, {{it is used}} to make propeller shafts, rigging, and heat exchangers in desalination plants; heater-chillers for salt water aquariums, <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> and leader, and divers' knives. Titanium is used in the housings and components of ocean-deployed surveillance and monitoring devices for science and the military. The former Soviet Union developed techniques for making submarines with hulls of titanium alloys forging titanium in huge vacuum tubes.|$|E
5|$|Much {{floating}} plastic trash {{does not}} biodegrade, instead disintegrating {{over time and}} eventually breaking down to the molecular level. Rigid plastics may float for years. In {{the center of the}} Pacific gyre, there is a permanent floating accumulation of mostly plastic waste and there is a similar garbage patch in the Atlantic. Foraging sea birds such as the albatross and petrel may mistake debris for food and accumulate indigestible plastic in their digestive systems. Turtles and whales have been found with plastic bags and <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> in their stomachs. Microplastics may sink, threatening filter feeders on the seabed.|$|E
50|$|As {{written in}} 1667 by Samuel Pepys, the <b>fishing</b> <b>lines</b> {{in his time}} were made from catgut. Later, silk <b>fishing</b> <b>lines</b> were used around 1724.|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>fishing</b> <b>lines</b> {{are usually}} made from {{artificial}} substances. The {{most common type}} is monofilament, made of a single strand. There are also braided <b>fishing</b> <b>lines</b> and thermally fused superlines.|$|R
50|$|Copper, monel {{and lead}} core <b>fishing</b> <b>lines</b> {{are used as}} heavy {{trolling}} main lines, usually followed with fluorocarbon line near the lure or bait with fishing swivel between the lines. Due to their high density, these <b>fishing</b> <b>lines</b> sink rapidly in water and they require less line for achieving desired trolling depth. On the other hand, these lines are relatively thick for desired strength, especially when compared with braided <b>fishing</b> <b>lines</b> and they often require reels with larger spools.|$|R
5|$|Nearly 24,000 {{metric tons}} of plastic are dumped into the ocean each year. Turtles ingest {{a wide array of}} this {{floating}} debris, including bags, sheets, pellets, balloons and abandoned <b>fishing</b> <b>line.</b> Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The ingested plastic causes numerous health concerns, including intestinal blockage, reduced nutrient absorption and malnutrition, suffocation, ulcerations, or starvation. Ingested plastics release toxic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, which may accumulate in internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, tissue damage, or deviation from natural behaviors.|$|E
5|$|The blacknose shark {{has never}} been implicated in an attack on humans. However, caution should be {{exercised}} if it begins to perform a threat display. This species {{is regarded as a}} game fish and offers a respectable fight on light tackle (a more delicate <b>fishing</b> <b>line).</b> It is also of regional commercial importance, being taken intentionally and as bycatch via gillnets and surface longlines across its range, most significantly off southwestern Florida, Venezuela, and Brazil; the meat is sold dried and salted. Large numbers of blacknose sharks are also caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers, which may pose a greater threat to its population, as many of the sharks taken are immature.|$|E
5|$|The kabosy (or kabosa) is a four to six-stringed simple guitar {{common in}} the {{southern}} Highlands moving toward the east, particularly among the Betsimisaraka and Betsileo ethnic groups. The soundbox, which is typically square or rectangular today, was originally circular in form, first made from a tortoise shell and later from wood carved into a rounded shape. Mandolina and gitara are the Antandroy names of a popular Southern chordophone similar to the kabosy but with nylon <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> for strings and five or seven movable frets that facilitate modification of the instrument's tuning.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fish</b> cell <b>line</b> {{has emerged}} as an {{important}} tool in fishery biotechnology. In recent years, various <b>fish</b> cell <b>lines</b> have been developed by different researchers across the country. National Repository on <b>Fish</b> cell <b>lines,</b> established with the aim to preserve <b>fish</b> cell <b>lines</b> for training and education to stakeholders, has started functioning at National Bureau of Fish Genetic Resources, Lucknow. This repository is supposed to characterize and preserve the <b>fish</b> <b>lines</b> developed {{across the country and}} serve as a national referral centre for Indian and exotic <b>fish</b> cell <b>lines.</b> Currently, the repository is maintaining 50 <b>fish</b> cell <b>lines</b> deposited by various research institutes in India, including the cell lines developed at cell culture facility of National Bureau of Fish Genetic Resources. The cell lines have been successfully cryopreserved after verifying its authenticity by sequence analysis of two mitochondrial genes, viz. 16 S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase sub-unit I. Chromosomal analysis, transfection efficiency and immunocytochemistry are also being used to characterize the cell lines. The facility is serviceable for the collection, deposition and distribution of <b>fish</b> cell <b>lines.</b> This paper discusses the status as well as the methodology adopted for <b>fish</b> cell <b>lines</b> development, characterization and storage at NRFC...|$|R

5|$|Where {{pelicans}} {{interact with}} fishers, through either {{sharing the same}} waters or scavenging for fishing refuse, they are especially vulnerable to being hooked and entangled in both active and discarded fishing lines. Fish hooks are swallowed or catch in {{the skin of the}} pouch or webbed feet, and strong monofilament <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> can become wound around bill, wings or legs, resulting in crippling, starvation, and often death. Local rescue organisations have been established in North America and Australia by volunteers to treat and rehabilitate injured pelicans and other wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Players cast a <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> {{into the}} ocean and use motion {{controls}} to avoid fish as the hook sinks and to catch as many fish as possible as the reel retracts. Players then touch the screen to shoot fish {{out of the sky}} for money that can be spent on upgrades. Nijman developed the idea during a television show about tuna fishermen. The game was first released as Flash game Radical Fishing with the same basic mechanics. A year after Vlambeer began their iOS development, Gamenauts released Ninja Fishing, a clone of the game that hurt Vlambeer morale. The team worked on other games and spoke publicly about the situation to a standing ovation at the 2012 Game Developers Conference before resolving to scrap the majority of their work and finish the game. Artist Greg Wohlwend moved in with iOS developer Zach Gage to work 14-hour days on the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{bramble shark}} {{is not known}} to pose a danger to humans. It is caught {{incidentally}} by commercial fisheries in bottom trawls and on <b>fishing</b> <b>line,</b> {{as well as by}} sport anglers. In the eastern Atlantic, this species is processed into fishmeal but has little commercial significance. Its liver oil is highly valued in South Africa as medicine, whereas in India the oil is considered poor and is used to coat canoes to discourage woodboring beetles. Historical accounts suggest that bramble shark numbers in the northeastern Atlantic have fallen markedly since the 18th and 19th centuries, such as that it is now extremely rare off northern Europe and in the Mediterranean. This decline has been attributed to fishing pressure, to which this species may be highly vulnerable as large, deep-sea sharks generally have slow growth rates and long lifespans. Regarding the species as a whole, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient data for an assessment beyond Data Deficient.|$|E

25|$|Planer {{boards are}} trolled devices {{designed}} to spread fishing lures out {{away from the}} fishing vessel. They allow multiple lines to be trolled. They come in dual board and inline board designs. Dual board designs consist of two boards that are spaced apart and attached by a line to a mast {{near the front of}} the boat with a separate <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> in a spring tension release clip that separates when the <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> is set. Inline boards are attached directly to the <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> and a spring tension clip that releases upon setting or tripping the planer board so it slides down the <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> to a swivel tied several feet in front of the lure. Inlines are popular with walleye fishermen. Once tripped they offer much less resistance when reeling in a fish.|$|E
25|$|Tackle that is {{attached}} {{to the end of a}} <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> is called terminal tackle. This includes hooks, sinkers, floats, leaders, swivels, split rings and wire, snaps, beads, spoons, blades, spinners and clevises to attach spinner blades to fishing lures.|$|E

25|$|Commonly {{referred}} {{to parts of}} a fish hook are: its point - the sharp end that penetrates the fish's mouth or flesh; the barb - the projection extending backwards from the point, that secures the fish from unhooking; the eye - {{the end of the}} hook that is connected to the <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> or lure; the bend and shank - that portion of the hook that connects the point and the eye; and the gap - the distance between the shank and the point. In many cases, hooks are described by using these various parts of the hook. Example: Wide gap, 2X Long Shank, Hollow Point, Turned Down Ring Eye Bait hook.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{classify}} debris {{as either}} land- or ocean-based; in 1991, the United Nations Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution estimated {{that up to}} 80% of the pollution was land-based. More recent {{studies have found that}} more than half of plastic debris found on Korean shores is ocean-based. A wide variety of anthropogenic artifacts can become marine debris; plastic bags, balloons, buoys, rope, medical waste, glass bottles and plastic bottles, cigarette stubs, cigarette lighters, beverage cans, polystyrene, lost <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> and nets, and various wastes from cruise ships and oil rigs are among the items commonly found to have washed ashore. Six pack rings, in particular, are considered emblematic of the problem.|$|E
25|$|Their float was {{stocked with}} biscuits, chocolate, Horlicks tablets, Bovril pemmican, 22 gallons (100 litres) {{of water and}} 2 gallons (9 litres) of massage oil for use against exposure. There was also a sail, which they rigged as a {{makeshift}} shelter. After three days of rough weather the sea calmed and the raft drifted. The men's health deteriorated, but the ration cans had keys to open them, and from one of these White improvised a fishing hook. He untwisted the fibres of a rope and made them into a <b>fishing</b> <b>line.</b> With this they caught about 50 fish, which they ate raw. This gave the survivors both protein and nutritious fish oil, which improved their health and did much to keep them alive.|$|E
