5000|$|Bank Reserves Because bank {{reserves}} can constitute {{paper money}} {{as well as}} <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>Deposits,</b> {{it is not an}} accurate equivocation. If you were to subtract cash/coin reserves from total bank reserves you would get the total amount of <b>Federal</b> <b>Deposits</b> (not counting the Treasury's <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>Deposits).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Fed Funds Also are not <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>Deposits.</b> The Fed defines Fed Funds as loans made {{by banks}} to banks which {{typically}} have a time period of one day.

50|$|As of July 2017, the Federal Reserve's {{balance sheet}} shows $2.5 {{trillion}} in <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>Deposits</b> {{as opposed to}} $1.5 trillion in Federal Reserve Notes. The largest holders of <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>Deposits</b> are foreign governments, the Treasury, and mostly private banks in the US. Private citizens and companies {{are not allowed to}} hold <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>Deposits.</b> Both <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>Deposits</b> and <b>Federal</b> Reserve Notes are recorded as liabilities to the Fed. What the Fed has exchanged these deposits and notes for (gold and mostly t-bills) are recorded as assets to the Fed. To the private banks, the <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>Deposits</b> are assets. Private banks do have the option to convert <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>Deposits</b> into <b>Federal</b> Reserve Notes and vice versa, as needed {{to meet the demands of}} bank customers.|$|R
5|$|Cranston {{continued}} intervening {{on behalf}} of Keating after the April 1987 meetings, contacting both Wall and California state regulators and continuing to receive large amounts of new donations to the voter registration projects from Keating. DeConcini also continued {{on behalf of}} Keating, contacting Wall, California State regulators, and the <b>Federal</b> <b>Deposit</b> Insurance Corporation (FDIC) advocating approval of a sale of Lincoln as a December 1988 alternative to government seizure. Bank regulators refused to approve the sale of Lincoln. Glenn too continued to help Keating after the April 1987 revelation, by setting up a meeting with then-House Majority Leader Jim Wright.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, facing {{financial}} collapse, Bain & Company asked Romney to return. Announced as its new CEO in January 1991, he drew {{a symbolic}} salary of one dollar (remaining managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time). He oversaw an effort to restructure Bain & Company's employee stock-ownership plan and real-estate deals, while rallying the firm's one thousand employees, imposing a new governing structure that excluded Bain and the other founding partners from control, and increasing fiscal transparency. He got Bain and other initial owners who had removed excessive amounts of money from the firm to return substantial amounts, and persuaded creditors, including the <b>Federal</b> <b>Deposit</b> Insurance Corporation, to accept less than full payment. Within about a year, he had led Bain & Company to a return to profitability. He turned Bain & Company over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992.|$|E
5|$|The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on {{a monthly}} basis back to 1854; {{according}} to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe. Factors that may have contributed to this moderation include the creation of a central bank and lender of last resort, like the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the establishment of deposit insurance {{in the form of the}} <b>Federal</b> <b>Deposit</b> Insurance Corporation in 1933, increased regulation of the banking sector, the adoption of interventionist Keynesian economics, and the increase in automatic stabilizers in the form of government programs (unemployment insurance, social security, and later Medicare and Medicaid). See Post-World War II economic expansion for further discussion.|$|E

25|$|In the House of Representatives, Representative Steagall opposed {{even the}} revised Glass bill with its limited {{permission}} for branch banking.

25|$|Aside {{from the}} new <b>federal</b> <b>deposit</b> {{insurance}} system, S. 1631 added provisions based on earlier versions of the Glass bill that became Sections 21 (prohibiting securities firms from taking deposits) and 32 (prohibiting common directors or employees for securities firms and banks) of the Glass–Steagall Act.|$|E
5000|$|The Senate's response, {{dominated}} by Whigs, was {{an assault on}} Andrew Jackson as an executive, rather than on Bank recharter or the <b>federal</b> <b>deposits.</b> Henry Clay, spearheading the attack, described Jackson as a [...] "backwoods Caesar" [...] and his administration a [...] "military dictatorship".|$|R

50|$|The Bank War {{continued}} to rage when Congress reconvened on December 3, 1833, with {{removal of the}} <b>federal</b> <b>deposits</b> already an accomplished fact.

50|$|These gold {{deposits}} {{would become}} known as <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>Deposits</b> and quickly lost their 100% gold backing. During the Fed's inception, the Fed needed only to back gold deposits by 35%. This created a very dangerous situation because if more than 35% of banks demanded their <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>Deposits</b> as gold, then the Fed would be insolvent. Such a crisis did happen in 1933 and <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>Deposits</b> (as well as Federal Reserve Notes) lost their gold backing. Foreign governments were still allowed {{to be on the}} gold standard and their <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>Deposits</b> were still redeemable in gold. But these too were only fractionally backed. This inevitably led to another gold run in 1971, led by heavy withdrawals by Switzerland (51 million) and France (191 million). Nixon chose instead of heavily devaluing the dollar against gold, to simply remove the US from the international gold standard.|$|R
