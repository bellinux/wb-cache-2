500|$|Rudraveena is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} acclaimed works of Ilaiyaraaja in Telugu cinema. K. Naresh Kumar of The Hans India commented that K. J. Yesudas and K. S. Chithra bring the song [...] "Lalitha Priya Kamalam" [...] to life [...] "soothingly", adding that everything <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> the number in terms of instrumentation. Pulagam Chinnarayana of Sakshi praised Ilaiyaraaja's varied instrumentation in the re-recording and found Sitaramasastri's lyrics [...] "optimistic and poetic". Writing for Swarajya, Sandeep Balakrishna stated that Ilaiyaraaja's work in composing [...] "Lalitha Priya Kamalam" [...] is a great study in [...] "systematically developing and exploring [...] raga" [...] in terms of both the structure and quality of the entire composition. At the presentation of the Sri Raja-Lakshmi award in November 2006, Balasubrahmanyam performed the song [...] "Taralirada" [...] at Kalabharathi auditorium, Visakhapatnam.|$|E
500|$|Carl Marbach of AVweb wrote {{positively}} of {{the first}} portion of the book, but was critical of the latter half: [...] "On the whole, the book has some worthwhile sections notwithstanding the soap opera ramblings at the end. Read the first half, then pass it along to another pilot-friend." [...] John Clark of The Plain Dealer gave the book a positive review, but was also critical of the instructive section {{at the end of}} the book: [...] "Narratively, the book breaks down when Schiavo resorts to lists and tables to provide information to help the reader fly more safely." [...] Robert W. Poole Jr. reviewed the book for Reason, and called it [...] "valuable and frustrating". Poole noted [...] "Only an outsider-insider like Schiavo could provide ordinary people with authentic accounts of how badly off-track the FAA has gotten in its job of looking after aviation safety," [...] but commented that some aviation veterans regarded her as a [...] "loose cannon". Jerry Fraser of The Boston Globe was critical in his review of the book, and wrote that [...] "a book that sets out to be 'everything you need to know to travel safer by air' winds up griping about how the FAA reimburses employees for moving expenses and conducts crude management-training seminars". The book received a critical review from Bill Adair in the St. Petersburg Times, who wrote: [...] "Schiavo <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> many problems at the FAA. ... But Schiavo seems unable to offer a calm and constructive account of the FAA's problems. She'd rather grab headlines with wild and often inaccurate comments." ...|$|E
500|$|Themes in {{the series}} often revolve around {{forbidden}} love, such as those involving Bluestar and Oakheart, Graystripe and Silverstream, Leafpool and Crowfeather, and Dovewing and Tigerheart. These relationships are not allowed for various reasons: some involve medicine cats (such as Leafpool), who cannot have mates, while others develop between cats in different Clans, which is forbidden by the warrior code. Holmes said that another central theme of the series centres on [...] "faith and spirituality" [...] in StarClan. [...] All books {{in the series}} feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats think of them, {{but in terms of}} prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true. [...] Some scenes take place within StarClan's realm, with no living cats present as point-of-view characters. [...] Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series. Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. For example, the Tribe of Rushing Water, which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans, is introduced in Moonrise. In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books never say that either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> faith because both are [...] "equally valid." [...] This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid of things they do not understand. Holmes said that [...] "ignorance is a very scary thing!" [...] Non-belief is also significant in the storylines: Mothwing and Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan.|$|E

[...] "That's a complaint you hear mostly from people who don't empty slop jars. This country {{has a lot of}} people who do exactly that for a living. And they do it well. It's not pleasant work, but it's a living. And it has to be done. Somebody has to go around and empty all those bed pans. And it's perfectly honorable work. There's nothing the matter with doing it. Indeed, there is a lot that <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> doing it, as any hospital patient will tell you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, Ronstadt {{released}} a mainstream pop album and several popular singles. This effort, titled Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind, {{became one of}} the singer's most successful albumsin terms of production, arrangements, chart sales, and critical acclaim. It became Ronstadt's tenth Top 10 album on the Billboard chart, reaching number 7 and being certified triple-platinum (over three million copies sold in the U.S.). The album also garnered critical acclaim, receiving numerous Grammy Award nominations and being praised by Amazon.com as [...] "an album that defines virtually everything that <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> adult contemporary pop." [...] Ronstadt featured New Orleans soul singer Aaron Neville on several of the album's songs.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's true, father, still I am not sure; {{perhaps because}} I am rather that way myself, sometimes.

6000|$|To {{return to}} the Claim. I find myself greatly embarrassed by Mrs. Eddy's remark: [...] "I regard self-deification as blasphemous." [...] If she <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> that, I have written a half-ream of {{manuscript}} this past week which I must not print, either in the book which I am writing, or elsewhere: for it goes into that very matter with extensive elaboration, citing, in detail, words and acts of Mrs. Eddy's which {{seem to me to}} prove that she is a faithful and untiring worshipper of herself, and has carried self-deification to a length which has not been before ventured in ages. If ever. There is not room enough in this chapter for that Survey, but I can epitomize a portion of it here.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know of a}} man--a hunter," [...] said Beniah, [...] "a wild sort of being, {{who lives}} {{a long way from}} here, in a {{beautiful}} part of the land, where there is a wonderful swamp with a hot spring in the midst of it. Besides hunting, the man who lives there cultivates the ground a little, and keeps a few cattle and pigs. It may be that he can put you in the way of finding what you want; and you need not tell him about your disease, for you are not yet sure about it. Thus you will have an opportunity of keeping {{out of the way of}} men until you find out whether the doctor <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> it. He may be wrong, you know. Diseases sometimes resemble each other without being the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|March and Beaton {{remained}} {{alone together}} for a moment, and March said: [...] "I hope you will think it worth while to take hold with us, Mr. Beaton.

[...] He had that timidity of the elder {{in the presence of the}} younger man which the younger, preoccupied with his own timidity in the presence of the elder, cannot imagine. Besides, March was aware of the gulf that divided him as a literary man from Beaton as an artist, and he only ventured to feel his way toward sympathy with him. [...] "We want to make it good; we want to make it high. Fulkerson <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> aiming to please the women, but of course he caricatures the way of going about it." ...|$|E
