40|$|Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) {{are used}} to study crack {{propagation}} in unreinforced concrete of massive structures. This approach is well suited to the nonlinear analysis of structures of large dimensions, {{taking into account the}} size effect, i. e., the influence of the dimension of the structure on its behaviour at rupture. The Finite Element method is used to calculate the structure and the hypothesis of plane strain is made. The use of a criterion of crack propagation, based on LEFM requires the calculation of stress intensity factors. The evaluation of the latter is performed by the mean of a surface integral defined around the tip of the crack studied. It has been shown in this work that this integral is derived from the path integral J. The use of the surface integral has also been extended to the cases where body forces (gravity, <b>inertie)</b> act, or when the edges of the crack are subjected to pressure. This method is precise and numerically efficient. A smeared crack model is used in order to avoid continuous remeshing during crack propagation. But, as it has been shown in this research, classical smeared crack elements do not give satisfactory results when the crack is submitted to shear loading, a new finite element, using smeared cracking but with discontinuous shape functions has been developed. The model which combines LEFM and the smeared crack approach has been applied to different classical problems of fracture mechanics. It leads to good results under static or dynamic loading. As an example, the nonlinear behaviour of the vertical cross section of a gravity dam during an earthquake has been calculated and the crack pattern identified. Many further developments could be done starting from this original approach, in order to simulate more closely the real behaviour of structures, taking into account friction in the cracks and the three-dimensional development of then...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{switching}} behaviour of sickness fund enrolees in the Swiss health insurance system. Even though the new Federal Law on Social Health Insurance (LAMal) was implemented in 1996 to promote competition among health insurers in basic insurance, there still remains large premium variations within cantons. This indicates that competition {{has not been able}} so far to lead to a single price, and reveals some inertia among consumers who seem reluctant to switch to less expensive funds. We investigate one possible barrier to switching behaviour, namely the influence of the supplementary insurance. Our aim is to analyse two decisions (switching decision in basic insurance, subscription to supplementary insurance contracts). We use survey data on health plan choice and import some market data related to the sickness funds (number of enrollees, premiums). The decision to switch and the decision to subscribe to a supplementary contract are estimated both separately and jointly. The results suggest that holding a supplementary insurance contract substantially decreases the propensity to switch. However the impact of supplementary insurance is not significant when the individual assesses his/her health as "very good"; to the contrary, holding a supplementary contract significantly reduces the propensity to switch when the indivual's subjective health status deteriorates. Futhermore, the switching decision is positively influenced by the expected gain of switching. In comparison with the range of the premium difference, the limitations to switch due to the supplementary insurance is moderate, though non negligible. As for the decision to subscribe a supplementary contract, the results show that the income level has a direct positive influence on the propensity to buy a supplementary insurance. Our results suggest that a major mechanism is going on in relation to supplementary insurance: holding a supplementary contract might stop individuals from switching when the individual thinks that she/he could be regarded as a bad risk due to the selection practices that are allowed in supplementary insurance markets. This result bears major policy implications concerning the regulation of basic and supplementary insurance markets. Cet article étudie le comportement de changement de caisse d'assurance maladie en Suisse. Malgré la loi de 1996 qui visait à promouvoir la concurrence entre caisses pour l'assurance maladie de base, de grandes différences de primes subsistent au sein de chaque canton. Ceci indique que la concurrence n'a pas conduit à un prix unique et montre une certaine <b>inertie</b> des consommateurs. Nous analysons une barrière potentielle au comportement de mobilité des consommateurs, à savoir l'impact de l'assurance complémentaire. L'analyse empirique porte sur des données d'enquête sur le choix d'assurance maladie. Les résultats suggèrent que détenir une assurance complémentaire diminue sensiblement la propention à changer de caisse, sauf lorsque l'état de santé est très bon. En outre, le gain potentiel à changer de caisse augmente la probabilité de changer. Le revenu est un élément déterminant du choix de souscrire une assurance complémentaire. Nos résultats indiquent qu'un mauvais état de santé peut entraîner un individu à hésiter à changer de caisse, ignorant s'il sera encore possible de souscrire une assurance complémentaire auprès du nouvel assureur. Dans tous les cas, la demande pour l'assurance de base et pour l'assurance complémentaire étant liées, la régulation de chacun de ces marchés ne peut être faite isolément de l'autre...|$|E
