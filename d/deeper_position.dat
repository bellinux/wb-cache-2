On 12 December, he set up Daniele De Rossi's opening goal in a 1–1 home draw against eventual league champions Juventus, although Totti missed a second-half penalty during the match. He provided several more assists that season, notably for Dani Osvaldo's goal in Roma's 3–1 win over Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo on 18 December 2011, and also set up De Rossi's goal against Catania at the Massimino stadium. Playing in a <b>deeper</b> <b>position</b> on the pitch, the Roma talisman did not seek to score goals as often, opting rather to play more of a supporting role by bridging the gap between attack and midfield, using his presence, leadership and experience in games to offer some much needed depth to the team.|$|E

500|$|Manchester City {{started the}} match strongly, {{particularly}} Francis Lee; The Guardian correspondent wrote [...] "Lee, indefatigable and nigh irresistible continually embarrassed the Górnik defence {{in the early}} stages". Lee had the first chance of the match, a close range shot which was saved by Kostka. Manchester City {{took the lead in}} the 12th minute. Lee cut in from the left wing, escaping a tackle from Alfred Olek, and struck a fierce shot. Goalkeeper Hubert Kostka parried the ball, only for it to land at the feet of Neil Young for a simple finish. Shortly after City defender Mike Doyle sustained an ankle injury after colliding with Stefan Florenski. Manchester City played on with ten men for a period as Doyle received treatment from trainer Dave Ewing, but the defender was unable to continue. Substitute Ian Bowyer replaced him. The change prompted an alteration in formation, in which Colin Bell switched to a <b>deeper</b> <b>position.</b> [...] Shortly before half-time, Young won the ball after loose play from Florenski, which put him clear on goal. As Young moved into the penalty area Kostka rushed out of his goal and upended him, leaving the referee no option but to give a penalty. Lee struck the spot-kick with power into the centre of the goal. Kostka's legs made contact with the ball, but the force of the shot carried it into the net to make it 2–0. Górnik got a goal back midway through the second half, but there were no more goals and the match finished 2–1.|$|E

[...] A versatile and well-rounded footballer, from a tactical standpoint, Ibrahimović is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, due to his ability to both create and score goals for his team, although he is most often deployed as a striker, due to his composure and eye for goal. He has also functioned in a more creative playmaking role at times, as a supporting forward or even as a number 10, in particular in his later career, after losing some of his pace and stamina with age; this <b>deeper</b> <b>position</b> allows him to drop into midfield to pick up the ball, where he can utilise his technical ability, vision, passing, and movement to create space and provide assists for teammates.|$|E

50|$|An elegant, quick, mobile, well-rounded, and {{powerful}} footballer, Boniperti {{is regarded as}} one of the greatest and most successful Italian players of all time, and as one of Juventus's greatest players. A versatile forward, he began his career as a striker, making a name for himself due to his talent eye for goal, and later emerging to prominence as a prolific goalscorer for much of his career; in this role, he was usually supported by star team mates such as John and Karl Aage Hansen, and Karl Aage Præst. As a centre-forward, he was known for his ability in the air and for having the capacity to score with both feet, as well as his head; he also had a penchant for scoring acrobatic goals. A team player, in the later part of his career, as he lost his pace, he moved into a <b>deeper</b> <b>position,</b> functioning as a creative second striker or inside forward, as an attacking midfielder, winger, or even as a central midfielder or midfield playmaker. Due to his excellent ball control, technical ability, vision, tactical intelligence, and passing range, he excelled as an assist provider during the final few years for his career, creatively supporting his more offensive team mates John Charles and Omar Sívori. In addition to his footballing ability, he was also known for his leadership.|$|E
50|$|Throughout his career, Gattuso mainly {{played as}} a central or {{defensive}} midfielder, although he was even deployed on the right flank on occasion, either as a full-back, wing-back, or as a winger, due to his versatility; he was also capable of playing {{as a central}} defender. Despite not being particularly skilful from a technical standpoint (although {{he was able to}} improve in this area with time under the tutelage of Mauro Tassotti), Gattuso was a strong, consistent, aggressive, and hard-tackling midfielder, with an extremely high work rate; he also possessed a powerful shot, and quick reactions, as well as an excellent positional sense and good anticipation, which enabled him to excel in this position; in his prime, he was widely {{regarded as one of the}} best defensive midfielders in the world. His energetic and combative box-to-box style of play, as well as his pace, tactical awareness and abilities as a ball-winner, allowed him to form a successful midfield partnership with playmaker Andrea Pirlo throughout his career, both at club and international level. Gattuso's <b>deeper</b> <b>position</b> on the pitch allowed him to support Pirlo and his other team-mates defensively by breaking up the opposition's attacks; he often only advanced in order to intercept the ball and play it to one of his more creative or offensive team-mates after winning back possession, subsequently returning to his more defensive midfield role. His tenacity on the pitch, exemplified by his fierce challenges and stamina, earned him the nickname Ringhio (Snarl). In addition to his footballing abilities, he also stood out for his competitive spirit and his leadership.|$|E
