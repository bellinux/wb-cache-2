The government legislation on <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> is implemented in England under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 Part IIA (and its amendments), which requires for the Local Authorities to identify <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> in their area and determine the severity of the contamination and the person responsible for the contamination.

Up to the <b>Contaminated</b> <b>Land</b> Regulations of 2000, <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> had no clear definition.

The effect of such Pb heterogeneity on plant uptake was investigated in greenhouse pot trials. Two earlier pot trials, which assessed the effect of Pb in a fixed concentration (1000 mg/kg) and in a range of concentration (100 to 10000 mg/kg) found a significant effect of the Pb added treatments, when compared to a control treatment (0 mg/kg Pb added).

40|$|<b>Contaminated</b> <b>land</b> {{management}} {{has become a}} major concern for Nigeria. Sites affected by petroleum hydrocarbons from oil exploitation activities have been identified as a major environmental and socio-economic problem in the Niger Delta region. Though air and water regulations have received the most attention, the regulatory system for <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> remains largely undeveloped. As a result, Nigeria oil <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> governance lacks a clear and well-established policy framework; administrative structure and capacity; technical methods; and incentive structures. A consequence of these limitations is the inevitable ad hoc management of <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> in Nigeria. This thesis aims to provide a comprehensive and integrated <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> management policy framework for Nigeria. This work adopts a qualitative approach including critical review methodology and field surveys to investigate the current practice in <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> management in Nigeria. Key findings from this research clearly indicate an urgent need for a regulatory policy supported by a holistic and coordinated structure, coupled with improved technical capacity and additional resources to prevent new contamination and to address legacy contaminated sites. A technical strategy to identify and characterise <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> in terms of Source-Pathway-Receptor (S-P-R) linkages, a liability regime and the establishment of land use standards are required in Nigeria. Field surveys were used to pilot a proposed stakeholder engagement approach that integrates consideration of social values that could influence <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> management policy. Top ranked social values included drinking water, soil quality, and food and local supply chain. Based on this research a pathway for improving the current policy was proposed. The pathway identifies the need to engage stakeholders, educate and improve awareness, increase trust and transparency and integrate societal values into <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> management decision- making. An integrated risk assessment framework for <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> management in Nigeria was also proposed, and completed with a pathway for integrating the social values and sustainability indicators identified previously. The study proposes a timeline for achieving comprehensive <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> management policy in Nigeria. Finally, a multi-attribute methodology for <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> prioritisation in Nigeria was developed to identify and promptly respond to sites that pose the highest risk to receptors, considering the limited nature of resources for <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> management...|$|R

Nevertheless, in <b>heavily</b> <b>contaminated</b> soils (mainly by Zn) willows can suffer from chlorosis because of Fe deficiency induced by excess of Zn amount. Method such as chemophytostabilization seems like very good measure for planting willows in such <b>heavily</b> <b>contaminated</b> soil. In our experiments we evaluated effect of rock phosphate on changes in Zn and Fe bioavailability and accumulation of these elements by willows together with the willows growth on <b>heavily</b> <b>contaminated</b> soil. Addition of rock phosphate reduced plant-available Zn concentrations in soils resulting in significant decrease of Zn content in leaves. In the case of Fe, however, its contents in the leaves significantly decreased as well, although the mobile portion of Fe in soil remained unchanged. Yield of aboveground biomass in rock phosphate treatment was not significantly different {{in comparison to the}} control. After the first vegetation period, we can conclude that reduction of Zn contents in willows after rock phosphate application did not lead to suppress of Fe deficiency and improvement of willow growth in <b>heavily</b> <b>contaminated</b> soil...|$|R

This dissertation is about the valuation of <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> {{and the problem of}} stigma. The value of <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> is to a large extent affected by statutory regulations. Stigma, if it exists, is another factor that has significant impact on <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> value. This thesis looks at the relevant laws governing <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> in Australia. It also introduces an alternative method to assess the stigma factor. [...] <b>Contaminated</b> <b>land</b> is a major environmental problem. Apart from causing actual or potential threats to human health and the environment, <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> also leads to legal liabilities and financial losses to the landowner. Regarding financial losses, they may be costs to meet legal requirements in relation to clean up and long term monitoring expenses. In addition, they may be losses due to a drop in market value and/or rental of the property, longer vacancy periods, high remediation and monitoring costs. In the extreme case, the property may lose marketability completely. [...] Regarding valuation methods, most valuers use traditional valuation methods with arbitrary adjustments. The most straightforward method is the impaired value (affected value) approach. It requires the valuer to assess the property on a clean land basis. From the unimpaired (clean) value, other financial losses due to contamination, remediation costs and stigma value loss are deducted to get the impaired value. The most difficult part is to quantify stigma impact. The existing stigma assessment methods are not satisfactory. Alternative and non-traditional methods are available. However they are academic and are not suitable for day-to-day operation of a valuer. This thesis suggests a multi-criteria decision-making model to assess stigma impact. The target stigma factor is obtained by processing the relevant criteria with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The best alternative from the model is the reasonable stigma factor for the property. Mode of access: World Wide Web. various pagings ill. (some col. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} five decades, Nigeria has {{developed}} a number of <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> legislations to address the damage caused primarily by oil and gas exploitation activities. Within these legislations exists elements of risk assessment and risk-based corrective action. Despite this progress, we argue that <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> management approaches in Nigeria need further development {{to be able to}} integrate new scientific information, and to address environmental, economic, and social values. By comparison, advanced <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> regimes in the United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States of America (USA) apply a number of integrative approaches (e. g. sustainability appraisal, liability regime, funding mechanisms, technology demonstration) that enable them to meet the environmental, economic, and social needs of their populations. In comparison, Nigerian governance lacks many of these mechanisms and management of <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> is ad hoc. In this paper we propose an integrated risk assessment framework for Nigeria that incorporates the principles of sustainability and stakeholder engagement into the decision-making processes for <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> risk assessment and risk management. The integrated approach relies on transparency to promote acceptance and build trust in institutions, and uses stakeholder engagement to address data deficiencies. We conclude this paper with a roadmap for how Nigeria might implement such an integrative approach into their existing <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> regulatory system, as well as identify a series of policy priorities that should be addressed...|$|R
