500|$|Conversely, various Marxist {{observers}} – including Western historians Hill and John Rees – {{argued against}} {{the view that}} Lenin's government was a dictatorship, viewing it instead as an imperfect way of preserving elements of democracy without some of the processes found in liberal democratic states. Ryan contends that the leftist historian Paul Le Blanc [...] "makes a quite valid point that the personal qualities that led Lenin to brutal policies were not necessarily any stronger than {{in some of the}} major Western leaders of the twentieth century". Ryan also posits that for Lenin, 'revolutionary' violence was merely a means to an end: the establishment of a socialist, ultimately communist world – a world without violence. Historian J. Arch Getty remarked, [...] "Lenin deserves {{a lot of credit for}} the notion that the meek can <b>inherit</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth,</b> that there can be a political movement based on social justice and equality."

The novel is about a war that released so much radioactive fallout that all the life in the Northern Hemisphere disappeared, while the Southern Hemisphere awaited a similar fate. However, the American government voiced a criticism of this premise—a threat of extinction from nuclear war—because they did not have enough nuclear weapons to cause human extinction. Similarly the premise that all of humanity would die following a nuclear war and only the [...] "cockroaches would survive" [...] is critically dealt with in the 1988 book Would the Insects <b>Inherit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> and Other Subjects of Concern to Those Who Worry About Nuclear War. A combination of the Castle Bravo detonation, alongside the subsequent poisoning of the Lucky Dragon 5, increased levels of anti-nuclear protests in Japan and the resultant comparisons to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki led to Castle Bravo frequently being mentioned or involved in the plots of numerous Japanese media, most prominently with what is perhaps Japan's most widely recognized media icon, Godzilla.|$|E

6000|$|James {{had been}} away from England for five years; {{and in that time}} a curious change, long silently proceeding, had made itself openly felt--becoming manifest, like an {{insidious}} disease, only when every limb and every organ were infected. A new spirit had been in action, eating into the foundations of the national character; it worked through the masses of the great cities, unnerved by the three poisons of drink, the Salvation Army, and popular journalism. A mighty force of hysteria and sensationalism was created, seething, ready to burst its bonds ... The canker spread through the country-side; the boundaries of class and class are now so vague that quickly the whole population was affected; the current literature of the day flourished upon it; the people of England, neurotic from the stress of the last sixty years, became unstable as water. And with the petty reverses of the beginning of the war, the last barriers of shame were broken down; their arrogance was dissipated, and suddenly the English became timorous as a conquered nation, deprecating, apologetic; like frightened women, they ran to and fro, wringing their hands. Reserve, restraint, self-possession, were swept away ... And now we are frankly emotional; reeds tottering in the wind, our boast is that we are not even reeds that think; we cry out for idols. Who is there that will set up a golden ass that we may fall down and worship? We glory in our shame, in our swelling hearts, in our eyes heavy with tears. We want sympathy at all costs; we run about showing our bleeding vitals, asking one another whether they are not indeed a horrible sight. Englishmen now are proud of being womanish, and nothing is more manly than to weep. To be a man of feeling is better than to be a gentleman--it is certainly much easier.

In her wildest flights she could never imagine linking herself with any man, no matter how exalted spiritually, who was not a man physically. It was a delight to her and a joy to look upon the strong males of her kind, with bodies comely in the sight of God and muscles swelling with the promise of deeds and work. Man, to her, was preeminently a fighter. She believed in natural selection and in sexual selection, and was certain that if man had thereby become possessed of faculties and functions, they were for him to use and could but tend to his good. And likewise with instincts. If she felt drawn to any person or thing, it was good for her to be so drawn, good for herself. If she felt impelled to joy in a well-built frame and well-shaped muscle, why should she restrain? Why should she not love the body, and without shame?
