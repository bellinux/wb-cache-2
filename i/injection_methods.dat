40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an improvement in}} power flow calculation based on current <b>injection</b> <b>method</b> by introducing optimization factor. In the method proposed by this paper, the PQ buses are represented by current mismatches while the PV buses are represented by power mismatches. It {{is different from the}} representations in conventional current injection power flow equations. By using the combined power and current <b>injection</b> mismatches <b>method,</b> the number of the equations required can be decreased to only one for each PV bus. The optimization factor is used to improve the iteration process and to ensure the effectiveness of the improved method proposed when the system is ill-conditioned. To verify the effectiveness of the method, the IEEE test systems are tested by conventional current <b>injection</b> <b>method</b> and the improved method proposed separately. Then the results are compared. The comparisons show that the optimization factor improves the convergence character effectively, especially that when the system is at high loading level and R/X ratio, the iteration number is one or two times less than the conventional current <b>injection</b> <b>method.</b> When the overloading condition of the system is serious, the iteration number in this paper appears 4 times less than the conventional current <b>injection</b> <b>method...</b>|$|R

50|$|Most {{vehicles}} manufactured {{from the}} mid-1970s until the mid-1990s have thermostatic {{air intake systems}} that regulate {{the temperature of the}} air entering the engine's intake tract, providing warm air when the engine is cold and cold air when the engine is warm to maximize performance, efficiency, and fuel economy. With the advent of advanced emission controls and more advanced fuel <b>injection</b> <b>methods</b> modern vehicles do not have a thermostatic air intake system and the factory installed air intake draws unregulated cold air. Aftermarket cold air intake systems are marketed with claims of increased engine efficiency and performance. The putative principle behind a cold air intake is that cooler air has a higher density, thus containing more oxygen per volume unit than warmer air.|$|E
50|$|The {{theoretical}} {{maximum power}} output from a hydrogen engine {{depends on the}} air/fuel ratio and fuel injection method used. The stoichiometric air/fuel ratio for hydrogen is 34:1. At this air/fuel ratio, hydrogen will displace 29% of the combustion chamber leaving only 71% for the air. As a result, the energy content of this mixture will be less {{than it would be}} if the fuel were gasoline.Since both the carbureted and port <b>injection</b> <b>methods</b> mix the fuel and air prior to it entering the combustion chamber, these systems limit the maximum theoretical power obtainable to approximately 85% of that of gasoline engines. Fordirect injection systems, which mix the fuel with the air after the intake valve has closed (and thus the combustion chamberhas 100% air), the maximum output of the engine can be approximately 15% higher than that for gasoline engines.|$|E

This paper deals with the derivation of the boundary conditions for phase current reconstruction in three-shunt sensing inverters and proposes a voltage <b>injection</b> <b>method</b> to expand the measurable areas. As the boundary conditions are deeply dependent on the switching patterns, they are typically analyzed on the voltage vector plane for space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) and discontinuous pulse width modulation (DPWM). In the proposed <b>method,</b> the voltage <b>injection</b> and its compensation are conducted within one sampling period. This guarantees fast current reconstruction and the injected voltage is decided so as to minimize the current ripple. In addition to the voltage <b>injection</b> <b>method,</b> a sampling point shifting method is also introduced to improve the boundary conditions.

Next, {{a small amount of}} fresh juice is added to the {{concentrated juice}} to restore natural and fresh flavors of orange juice that have been lost through the concentration process. Specific cold-pressed orange oils are used to restore the lost aroma and volatile flavors. After the addition of fresh juice, the brix content is reduced to 42 °F. The fresh juice is referred to as “cut-back” in the industry and attributes to 7-10% of the total juice. Orange peel oil is also added if the oil content is below the required level.

The concentrate is canned using steam <b>injection</b> <b>methods</b> to sterilize the lid and develop a vacuum in the can.

50|$|Research {{has been}} {{conducted}} into different ways farmers can perform estrous synchronization such as progesterone injections or a Progesterone Releasing Intra-vaginal Device PRID. The PRID is a sponge that is inserted into the vagina of a cow to stop the natural estrous cycle (for it acts as a corpus luteum), because progesterone is the hormone that signals the body to stop the cycle because fertilisation has occurred. When the sponge is removed the cycle restarts. This apparatus is useful in manipulating the cycle so that multiple cows can be ovulated around the same time. estrous synchronisation has major advantages in making artificial insemination more practical. Increasing the productivity of embryo transfer and artificial insemination is economically profitable as {{the costs associated with}} veterinarian and semen services are reduced.The reduction of costs occur because vets are required for less time to do the inseminating because the period of ovulation of the herd is decreased to 2-5 days. There are many different <b>injection</b> <b>methods</b> that have been put into practise in order to manipulate the estrous cycle. These involve injections into each cow with a measured amount of progesterone or progestin and waiting 5-7 days, or until heat signals occur, before moving onto different impregnating methods such as joining the cows or heifers with a bull.|$|E
50|$|The first {{automotive}} {{direct injection}} system {{used to run}} on gasoline was developed by Bosch, and was introduced by Goliath for their Goliath GP700 automobile, and Gutbrod in 1952. This was basically a high-pressure diesel direct-injection pump with an intake throttle valve. (Diesels only change the amount of fuel injected to vary output; there is no throttle.) This system used a normal gasoline fuel pump, to provide fuel to a mechanically driven injection pump, which had separate plungers per injector to deliver a very high injection pressure directly into the combustion chamber. The 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 Formula 1 racing car engine used Bosch direct injection derived from wartime aircraft engines. Following this racetrack success, the 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL, the first production sports car to use fuel injection, used direct injection. The 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SLR, in which Stirling Moss drove to victory in the 1955 Mille Miglia and Pierre Levegh crashed and died in the 1955 Le Mans disaster, had an engine developed from the W196 engine.
