500|$|French {{director}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino {{was selected}} by Bowie to direct an accompanying music video. Regarding this, Bowie said, [...] "It's an experiment; I'm really putting myself in his [...] hands. [...] I think if I did it , {{it would be very}} abrasive, and I'm not quite sure if that's <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> the song to come off visually. In concert it will be abrasive; it won't have the same quality as the video. But I really think Mondino is a fantastic video maker. He just knows that this is his genre. He's like a craftsman and that's what he's trying to perfect, this craft of making his five minutes work." [...] Actor Joe Dallesandro makes appearances throughout the clip, announcing the dance marathon. A shot from the music video was used to commercialize 7" [...] releases of the single.|$|E
500|$|Much of Dignity {{was written}} in Duff's own home, as she felt [...] "comfortable and free" [...] there. She said that she knew from the {{beginning}} that she wanted to write the album with the assistance of songwriter and producer Kara DioGuardi, due to their previous work history on songs such as [...] "Come Clean" [...] and [...] "Fly". Another reason that Duff wished to work with her was that she found her lyrics were complemented by DioGuardi's melodies. She added, [...] "I helped with the melodies, but that's not my strongest suit. Coming up with the lyrics was mainly [...] I'd tell her this is <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> it to go, and she would help with the lyrics, too, sometimes. She'd say, 'This doesn't really fit,' and if I was adamant, we'd make it work." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Deccan Herald, Anand talked about how the American sitcom Friends influenced the film's two characters revealing he wanted viewers to respond to Akash and Kiara in a similar way. He said: [...] "I remember when I watched Friends I wanted to meet and know every character. That's <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> audiences to feel about Ranbir and Priyanka." [...] He also wanted the two to resonate with the audience the way the characters in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) did. In another interview discussing the film, Anand revealed that he wanted to make it different from his earlier films, aiming for it to be a [...] "subdued romance," [...] which is not sexy. He said: [...] "Everyone is going to be covered up in scarf's and mufflers and over coats and boots. This is a rare instance that you’ll see Indian actors dressed full up without skin show."(sic) In September 2009, it was announced that Sajid Nadiadwala would produce the film as he was highly impressed by the script.|$|E
5000|$|Eminem recalls: [...] "Obviously, I {{was young}} and {{influenced}} by other artists, and I {{got a lot of}} feedback saying that I sounded like AZ. Infinite was me trying to figure out <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> my rap style to be, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to sound on the mic and present myself. It was a growing stage. I felt like Infinite was like the demo that just got pressed up." ...|$|R

500|$|He wrote [...] "Day 'n' Nite" [...] {{after the}} death of his uncle. The two were not on {{speaking}} terms after his uncle forced him out of his home before Cudi could find another living situation. A [...] bitter Cudi never apologized to him before his death, which he now regrets. Other songs on the album expand upon themes discussed in that single. Back in 2007, Drake, who was one of Cudi's first supporters, had shown interest in doing an official remix of [...] the song with him. However, Cudi chose against it since he was not interested in working with people who are in the [...] "same creative realm" [...] as him and because he was in the midst of creating his own works. Beginning in the fourth grade, and getting more tense after his father's death when he was 11, Cudi began dreaming of his own death (which usually was an automobile accident). He channeled these things into his material. Speaking to BlackBook in May 2009, Cudi said of the album and its content, [...] "Each song is a message. All the hooks are stadium-worthy, crowd sing-along, powerful joints that I can't wait for people to hear in stadium magnitude. My album definitely needs to be heard loudly, but it's also a great album if you're smoking and you need to go to sleep. So far I have the lineup of <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> the first seven tracks on my album and if I play the first seven from the beginning to the end, I'm zoned out and it's the best trip ever. You need to be high to appreciate the instrumentation and how everything is put together on the album—but you don't have to be high just to enjoy it in general." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a July 2010 {{interview}} with Metal Injection, Glenn Danzig {{was asked if}} he was going to make another Danzig record after Deth Red Sabaoth. His response was, [...] "I don't know, we'll see. With the way record sales are now...I won't do some stupid pro-tool record in someone's living room where all the drum beats are stolen from somebody and just mashed together...and I'm not going to do that if I can't do a record <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to do it, and if it's not financially feasible, I'm just not going to do one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not!" [...] said she, half peevishly. [...] "It {{will be over}} in a fortnight; {{and then}} I must have rest. Don't you see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> rest?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] he said, [...] "but {{you can hardly}} think <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be off. However, I fear that I am here for a week, at the very least. Just think what I am missing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{is plenty}} of time," [...] he declared. [...] "Better to start late and build on a sure foundation, you know.

5000|$|The album {{includes}} a stripped-down cover of Tracy Chapman's [...] "Fast Car", of which Stewart said [...] "That song really, very, very, very directly shaped <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to write lyrics or what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> songs to be about...I {{wanted them to}} turn out {{in so far as}} the song very specifically narrates some particular horrible things that happen to somebody and there's no positive resolution in the end at all." ...|$|R
5000|$|J.

6000|$|... "But it is possible," [...] he insisted. [...] "All {{that we need}} is courage. You owe {{nothing to}} your husband. You can leave him without remorse or a moment's shame. Your life just now is wasted,--a {{precious}} human life. I want you, Josephine. God knows <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear," [...] he cried, [...] "I {{have tried}} to do what I felt I ought--and now I'm not sorry that I find I'm not strong enough. I can't tell you <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> you--but I'm afraid you could not face what you would have to bear with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{had pulled}} my wet hands {{away from my}} face and was {{covering}} them with kisses. My cheeks were like two coals, my whole face was flaming and, I think, steaming. What could I do?

5000|$|Shermain, in an {{interview}} with an Antiguan newspaper Antigua Sun said: [...] "I decided not to sign on to a major label, since I would have to give up control, in terms of <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be portrayed. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to develop under TropicGem Records, and perhaps sign a major label deal after that. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to be seen as a}} Caribbean artist and I feel obligated to share my music with my people here in Antigua & Barbuda first, and then across the world." ...|$|R

60|$|You don't know <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to {{come home}} and see you all; you, dear mother, and Jeff and Mat and all. I believe I am homesick--something new for me--then I have seen all the horrors of soldiers' life and not been kept up by its excitement.

60|$|Thousands {{of shots}} must haven rained in on {{us in the}} next few minutes. <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to crawl out to the trench under the wagons where our men were keeping up a steady but {{irregular}} fire!

[...] In an interview for The Baltimore Sun, Saadiq discussed the inspiration behind the album's blaxploitation concept: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> a rich man, but I loved Jim Brown. <b>I</b> {{thought about}} <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> comfort {{for my father}} and <b>how</b> <b>I</b> had {{determined}} to stay single until a man presented himself who could give to the tired old man the things I longed for him. Jim was as poor as we were, and had no better chance in life. I struggled hard with myself in those days. I loved Jim, but he was poor. Finally, I decided that I'd {{be better off with}} a poor man whom I loved than with a wealthy one whose money had attracted me. So I married Jim Brown.|$|R
