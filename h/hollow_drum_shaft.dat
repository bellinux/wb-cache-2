40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a velocity regulation strategy for attenuating inherently periodic velocity {{variations of the}} organic photoconductive (OPC) drum in electrophotographic (EP) processes. Color misregistration {{is directly related to}} the fluctuations of the OPC drum velocity so that a reduction in velocity variations can improve image quality significantly. In order to reduce drum velocity variations, a velocity profile of the drum rotated by a constant motor drive is acquired through a rotary encoder mounted on the <b>drum</b> <b>shaft,</b> and it is necessary to find its amplitude, frequency, and phase. Then, it is possible that the drum velocity is regulated by modulating a brushless DC motor pulse in a sinusoidal shape. Experimental results show significant reduction in periodic velocity undulations of OPC drum...|$|R

Due to its unknown failure mode, a challenge was raised to the traditional fault diagnosis of mining equipments.

50|$|The exposed <b>drum</b> <b>shafts</b> {{are used}} to install and fix the drum motor into the {{conveyor}} frame and do not rotate. The shaft can be a single “through” shaft where the motor and gearbox are assembled on, and fixed to, the shaft with keys or pins. However, this type of drum motor design has a limited maximum radial load due to the bending stresses caused by the normal belt tension of a conveyor and is therefore used mainly for small light duty conveyors and loads. For heavier loads the most common design is to use two separate shafts, one fixed to the motor housing and one fixed to the gearbox housing where the mass of metal from the motor and gearbox significantly increases {{the strength of the}} drum motor allowing much higher payloads and longer conveyor applications. Typically one shaft is short (stub shaft) with a consistent length and the other increases in length according to the drum shell or belt width. Over certain widths, the shaft can be further reinforced to prevent bending under high belt tension.|$|R

The influence of these parameters is discussed and their impact on productivity is investigated in detailed order to identify existing correlations and optimize design and operation of the new system.
