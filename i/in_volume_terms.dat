50|$|At {{the start}} of the 1960s the old Dauphinoise was finally taken out of production, to be {{replaced}} on the Belgian production line by the much more modern Renault R4 (later rebranded as the Renault 4).

50|$|Smaller {{automakers}} {{found the}} Pons Plan neither as voluntary nor as temporary as some may have anticipated. The luxury auto-makers whose cars {{were to be}} targeted at export markets found few buyers in those neighbouring countries where the economy had, as in France, been devastated by war, and even the Swiss auto market was far too small to sustain the luxury brands of France, Britain, Italy and, increasingly as the 1940s rolled into the 1950s, Germany. North America had plenty of customers {{willing and able to}} spend money on new cars, but it also had powerful domestic auto producers, and <b>in</b> <b>volume</b> <b>terms</b> during the early years following the Second World War, at least until Mercedes-Benz made a serious return, imported British producers of luxury and sporting cars tended to outperform other European auto-makers in North America. As the Pons Plan receded into history during the 1950s, any surviving French luxury automakers might have been relieved that their steel supplies were no longer savagely restricted according to government policy, but other policies from the late 1940s that targeted larger cars, notably a punitive annual car tax for any passenger cars with engines larger than approximately 2 litres (coincidentally slightly above the standard engine size for the big Citroëns) endured.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1970 the Taunus TC had competed head-on for market-share {{with the}} Opel Ascona, and in 1973 {{the two were}} joined in what was now a {{three-way}} tussle by the Volkswagen Passat. Strictly comparable production data for the three cars are not easily accessible, but if one leaves out Opels assembled in Britain as Vauxhall Cavaliers, then <b>in</b> <b>volume</b> <b>terms</b> the three-way tussle was narrowly won between 1976 and 1982 by the Ford Taunus TC2/TC3, with 1,583,699 cars produced. [...] Between 1975 and 1981 Opel produced 1,316,459 Ascona Bs. The Opel figures would rise above those for the Taunus if one added the 196,512 Vauxhall Cavaliers built, on behalf of Vauxhall at Opel’s Antwerp plant, and be boosted further if one added the 534,634 mechanically similar Opel Mantas that shared the Ascona’s production line. During the six years between 1976 and 1982 Volkswagen produced 1,360,312 Passats. To make the Volkswagen group the convincing winner in this contest {{it would be necessary}} to add the 1,290,164 mechanically similar Audi 80s to the figure given here for the Volkswagen Passat. Despite its strong performance in the market place, by 1980, with new contenders from Volkswagen and Opel arriving, the output data suggest that the age of the Taunus TCs basic design was beginning to count against it.|$|E

5000|$|Another useful {{benchmark}} is {{the average}} price that customers pay for brands in a given category. This average can be calculated {{in at least two}} ways: (1) as the ratio of total category revenue to total category unit sales, or (2) as the unit-share weighted average price in the category. Note that the market Average Price Paid includes the brand under consideration. Note also that changes in unit shares will affect the average price paid. If a low-price brand steals shares from a higher-priced rival, the average price paid will decline. This would cause a firm’s price premium (calculated using the average price paid as a benchmark) to rise, even if its absolute price did not change. Similarly, if a brand is priced at a premium, that premium will decline as it gains share. The reason: a market share gain by a premium-priced brand will cause the overall average price paid in its market to rise. This, in turn, will reduce the price differential between that brand and the market average[...] [...] [...] To calculate the price premium using the average price paid benchmark, managers can also divide a brand’s share of the market in value terms by its share <b>in</b> <b>volume</b> <b>terms.</b> If value and volume market shares are equal, there is no premium. If value share is greater than volume share, then there is a positive price premium.|$|E
