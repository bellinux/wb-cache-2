500|$|Parallels can {{be drawn}} from Thomas More's 1516 book Utopia, in which More {{describes}} an island with only one entrance and only one exit. Only those who belonged to this island knew how to navigate their way through the treacherous openings safely and unharmed. This situation is similar to The Truman Show because there are limited entryways into the world that Truman knows. Truman does not belong to this utopia into which he has been implanted, and childhood trauma rendered him frightened of the prospect of ever leaving this small community. Utopian models of the past tended to be full of like-minded individuals who shared much in common, comparable to More's Utopia and real-life groups such as the Shakers and the Oneida Community. It is clear that the people in Truman's world are like-minded in their common effort to keep him oblivious to reality. The suburban [...] "picket fence" [...] appearance of the show's set is reminiscent of the [...] "American Dream" [...] of the 1950s. The [...] "American Dream" [...] concept in Truman's world serves as an attempt to keep <b>him</b> <b>happy</b> and ignorant.|$|E

Caren Gibson of Metal Hammer claimed that the song was reminiscent of [...] "Chain Reaction" [...] by Diana Ross, as well as the work of Depeche Mode. [...] "Blank and White" [...] deals with censorship, specifically the reaction to Time magazine's cover story [...] "Is God Dead?", which saw protesters brandishing blank picket signs. The lyric [...] "God is dead but god is still white / So shoot up the mall, the school or the president of whatever / Or whoever wants a fight" [...] was censored by Interscope on all editions of the album. Manson has said that this made <b>him</b> <b>happy</b> artistically, as [...] "the song is about censorship, and they censored [...]" ...|$|E
