5|$|Due to the Soviet {{principles}} of urban planning, Žirmūnai, {{according to the}} 2001 census data, was among the three Vilnius elderates (the other two being Karoliniškės and Viršuliškės) with the lowest percentage of single-family housing in the city (0.1%). Of the remaining residents, 0.4% owned a share of <b>individual</b> <b>housing,</b> 0.7% lived in hostels, and almost 99% lived in apartments. The scarcity of lots means {{that the number of}} single-family dwellings is not likely to increase; a reverse process is taking place: old wooden houses are being demolished, making room for new residential and commercial constructions. As of 2007, {{there were only a few}} modern single-family houses in Žirmūnai.|$|E

500|$|Reconstruction {{following}} the 1963 earthquake was mainly {{conducted by the}} Polish architect Adolf Ciborowski, who had already planned the reconstruction of Warsaw after World War II. Ciborowski divided the city in blocks dedicated to specific activities. The banks of the Vardar river became natural areas and parks, areas located between the main boulevards were built with highrise housing [...] and shopping malls, and the suburbs were left to <b>individual</b> <b>housing</b> and industry. Reconstruction had to be quick in order to relocate families and to relaunch the local economy. To stimulate economic development, the number of [...] thoroughfares was increased and future urban extension was anticipated.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2010s, Dyson refined his {{vocabulary}} {{for residential}} design with the Bishop residence (2012) in St. George, Utah. As the earlier Hilton residence in Florida had taken curvilinear form {{from the environmental}} cues of the Gulf of Mexico shore, the Bishop house {{was inspired by the}} sloping crest lines of mountains on the horizon and the undulating topography of the building site. [...] Dyson furthered his public service activity with a project designed to assist economically disadvantaged people. The Eco-Village or Eco Pod shelters (2013) were conceived as an optimistic solution to address the struggles of the homeless. Dyson proposed a grouping small, inexpensive personal habitation pods set within a safe, secure, and self-sustaining living environment. Built of recycled and sustainable materials, the <b>individual</b> <b>housing</b> units were centered on a commons containing gardens for growing food, personal hygiene facilities, and an educational space for teaching crafts for self-reliance. One of the most dramatic yet economically constrained forms to come from Dyson through the DSJ Architects practice emerged in the Selma Arts Center (2012/2013) in Selma, California. An infill construction in place of a collapsed store within an existing commercial block, this commission for a theatrical performance space produced a dynamic, extroverted facade that attracted attention to the arts activities. Other significant civic projects for DSJ Architects included a design for a new Fresno County Central Library (2007) [...] and a renovation of the Huron Library (2012) in Huron, California.|$|E

One can see both a regional tendency (73.9% of <b>individual</b> <b>housing</b> for Nord-Pas-de-Calais) and as a consequence of the presence in Cambrai by the headquarters of the Maison Familiale group, a national developer of detached houses which was particularly active in the years 1960 to 1980.
