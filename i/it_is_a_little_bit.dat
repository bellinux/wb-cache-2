2500|$|In July 2011, Osbourne {{and some}} of her fellow The Talk panelists were criticised for their conduct when {{discussing}} the story of Catherine Kieu. Osbourne described Kieu's cutting off of her husband's penis and putting it in a garbage disposal as [...] "quite fabulous", Osbourne also laughed about the incident with her fellow panellists and members of the audience. Osbourne's cohost Sara Gilbert offered the counterpoint [...] "Not to be a total buzz kill, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> sexist. If somebody cut a woman's breast off, nobody would be sitting laughing.", Osbourne replied by saying [...] "It's different". Osbourne later apologised for her behaviour, stating [...] "she was sorry she offended people" [...] and that she [...] "did not condone genital mutilation".|$|E

6000|$|... "He takes a {{pride in}} it," [...] the captain said, [...] "and {{you will never}} get good work done in any line, unless {{by a man who}} does so. A sailor who is {{careless}} about the appearance of his ship is sure to be careless about the keeping of the watch, and is not to be trusted in matters of navigation. When you see a craft with every rope in its place, everything spotlessly clean, the brass work polished up, and the paint carefully attended to, you may be sure that the skipper is as particular in more important matters. It is just so with our man. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of a galley, but his saucepans shine like gold, everything is clean and in its place. He grumbles if we run short of anything, and is a good deal more particular about my dinner being just what it should be than I am myself.|$|E
6000|$|... 26. I {{have looked}} wholly in vain through all my books on birds, {{to find some}} account of the muscles it uses in hopping, and of {{the part of the}} toes with which the spring is given. I must leave you to find out that for yourselves; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of anatomy which I think it highly {{desirable}} for you to know, but which it is not my business to teach you. Only observe, this is the point to be made out. You leap yourselves, with the toe and ball of the foot; but, in that power of leaping, you lose the faculty of grasp; on the contrary, with your hands, you grasp as a bird with its feet. But you cannot hop on your hands. A cat, a leopard, and a monkey, leap or grasp with equal ease; but the action of their paws in leaping is, I imagine, from the fleshy ball of the foot; while in the bird, characteristically [Greek: gampsônux], this fleshy ball is reduced to a boss or series of bosses, and the nails are elongated into sickles or horns; nor does the springing power seem to depend {{on the development of the}} bosses. They are far more developed in an eagle than a robin; but you know how unpardonably and preposterously awkward an eagle is when he hops. When they are most of all developed, the bird walks, runs, and digs well, but leaps badly.|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{reviewer}} wrote that, [...] "'Wavelength' {{makes some}} nods to its era (1978), most notably and obviously via {{the use of}} fat 1970s synthesizers—played by Peter Bardens—which play spacy loops that mimic the interference and bubbling feedback one gets when dialing up shortwave radio stations. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of cleverness, as Morrison elicits the same feelings on his own recording that he no doubt had discovering his favorite new music." ...|$|E
