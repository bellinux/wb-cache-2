25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E
500|$|For his part, Rodgers {{recalled}} {{that he had}} first seen Madonna perform at a small club in New York in 1983. In an interview with Time magazine, Rodgers explained: [...] "I went to the club to see another woman sing, but when I got there Madonna was onstage. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> stage presence and then we met right after that. I kept thinking to myself, 'Damn, is she a star', but she wasn't at that time. I always {{wanted to work with}} her and Like a Virgin seemed like a perfect opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|By this time, Virginia had {{developed}} consumption, first seen {{sometime in the}} middle of January 1842. While singing and playing the piano, Virginia began to bleed from the mouth, though Poe said she merely [...] "ruptured a blood-vessel". Her health declined and she became an invalid, which drove Poe into a deep depression, especially as she occasionally showed signs of improvement. In a letter to a friend, Poe described his resulting mental state: [...] "Each time I felt all the agonies of her deathand at each accession of the disorder <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> more dearly & clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity. But I am constitutionally sensitivenervous in a very unusual degree. I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity." ...|$|E

Then I threw down my useless trumpet and seized the glass. Madly I scanned the steamer. No sign of Bertha was to be seen. Mary Phillips was there, and now she waved her handkerchief. At all events she forgave me. At such a terrible moment what could one do but forgive? ...|$|R

500|$|Dixon {{has often}} cited Madonna as an influence, saying [...] "Madonna {{is a big}} idol. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> when I {{was a young girl}} and I feel like I've been on a musical journey with her". Dixon's single [...] "Let's Get Excited" [...] namechecked the singer and her 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove". Furthermore, the music video {{featured}} what Dixon described as [...] "a Madonna tribute" [...] featuring voguing throughout. Additionally, Dixon has described Kylie Minogue as her childhood idol. Growing up, the first record Dixon ever bought was [...] "Push It" [...] by the hip hop group Salt-n-Pepa; she remarked [...] "I didn't understand {{what they were talking about}} at the time... They were raw and did their own thing, and I loved that. I love artists who don't conform to what people expect of them".|$|E
500|$|After Winehouse's death, {{according}} to Pete Doherty, he and Winehouse were lovers at one point, {{speaking to the}} Daily Mail about it he said [...] "This is {{difficult for me to}} admit. But, yes, it's true. Amy and I were lovers. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> then and, well, I still do today. But towards the end, as only lovers can, she became quite mean and cruel to me. She didn't suffer fools… and believe me, she had a mean right hook." [...] However, in July 2008, Rolling Stone reporter Claire Hoffman asked Winehouse about her relationship with Doherty. Winehouse replied: [...] "We're just good friends", and added: [...] "I asked Pete to do a concept EP, and he made this face, he looked at me like I'd pooed on the floor. He wouldn't do it. We're just really close".|$|E
500|$|... "Porcelain" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Moby for his fifth studio album Play (1999) and recorded in his Little Italy, Manhattan apartment. He found the inspiration to compose the song from his experiences with an unidentified woman; speaking to Billboard, he explained: [...] "I {{was involved with}} this really, really wonderful woman, and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> very much. But I knew deep in my heart of hearts that we had no business being romantically involved. So, it's sort of about being {{in love with someone}} but knowing you shouldn't be with them." [...] Moby initially disliked the track, criticizing his production as [...] "mushy" [...] and his vocals as [...] "really weak". He had dismissed [...] "Porcelain" [...] as [...] "average" [...] and later recalled that he [...] "couldn't imagine anyone else wanting to listen to it" [...] – however, he was eventually talked into including it on Play.|$|E

500|$|The leading actor-manager Charles Hawtrey, {{whom the}} young Coward idolised and {{from whom he}} {{learned a great deal}} about the theatre, cast him in the children's play Where the Rainbow Ends. Coward played in the piece in 1911 and 1912 at the Garrick Theatre in London's West End. In 1912 Coward also {{appeared}} at the Savoy Theatre in An Autumn Idyll (as a dancer in the ballet) and at the London Coliseum in A Little Fowl Play, by Harold Owen, in which Hawtrey starred. Italia Conti engaged Coward to appear at the Liverpool Repertory Theatre in 1913, and in the same year he was cast as the Lost Boy Slightly in Peter Pan. He reappeared in Peter Pan the following year, and in 1915 he was again in Where the Rainbow Ends. He worked with other child actors in this period, including Hermione Gingold (whose mother threatened to turn [...] "that naughty boy" [...] out); Fabia Drake; Esmé Wynne, with whom he collaborated on his earliest plays; Alfred Willmore, later known as Micheál Mac Liammóir; and Gertrude Lawrence who, Coward wrote in his memoirs, [...] "gave me an orange and told me a few mildly dirty stories, and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> from then onwards." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Christine" [...] was {{the last}} of the band's {{recordings}} to feature Andrea Heukamp as a full member: having become tired of touring, she quit the band at the end of 1987. Although the split was amicable, Chadwick would later comment [...] "Losing Andrea Heukamp was a massive, massive blow for me: <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> voice and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> playing, she was easily as important as Pete, Terry or Chris." [...] Heukamp appeared in the group shot used for the cover of the band's first long-form release – a 1987 Germany-only compilation of the early recordings, eight songs all of which she had played on. This record was untitled apart from the band name and was consequently just known as The House of Love or informally as The German Album. Heukamp's split from The House of Love would not be absolute, as she would return as a studio guest on some of the band's subsequent albums.|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, {{while doing}} his show on KFI {{immediately}} after {{talk show host}} Toni Grant, for whom Leykis has repeatedly expressed professional affection and admiration, he hosted a segment with controversial pornographer Al Goldstein. Goldstein publicly claimed a sordid sexual relationship with Dr. Grant, saying [...] "She was the hottest sexual partner I ever had," [...] says Goldstein. [...] "But basically it was a dishonest relationship. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> fame. She loved my excitement. I was like the gamekeeper in Lady Chatterley's Lover. The dirty experience for a respectable woman. I knew it wouldn't last." [...] Leykis said that the unexpected announcement strained their professional relationship for some time.|$|E
2500|$|She was a {{close friend}} of fellow golfer Betty Dodd. According to Susan Cayleff's {{biography}} Babe, Dodd was quoted as saying, [...] "I had such admiration for this fabulous person [...] <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her.</b> I would have done anything for her." [...] They met in a 1950 amateur golf tournament in Miami and became close almost immediately. Cayleff wrote, [...] "As Didrikson's marriage grew increasingly troubled, she spent more time with Dodd. The women toured together on the golf circuit, and eventually Dodd moved in with Zaharias and Didrikson {{for the last six years}} of Didrikson's life. Victims of the homophobia of the times, they never used the word [...] "lesbian" [...] to describe their relationship, but there is little doubt that Dodd and Didrikson were intimate and loving partners." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{collision}} with the iceberg at 11:40 pm on 14 April 1912, Navratil placed Michel and Edmond in Collapsible D, the last lifeboat successfully launched from the ship. Michel, although not quite {{four years old}} at the time, later claimed to remember his father telling him, [...] "My child, when your mother comes for you, as she surely will, tell her that <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> dearly and still do. Tell her I expected her to follow us, so that we might all live happily together in the peace and freedom of the New World." [...] The elder Navratil died in the sinking, and his body was recovered by the rescue ship, Mackay-Bennett. In his pocket was a revolver. Because of his assumed Jewish surname, he was buried in Baron de Hirsch Cemetery, Halifax, a Jewish cemetery in Nova Scotia.|$|E
2500|$|Ivana Baquero as Ofelia / Princess Moanna, a {{child who}} comes to believe she is the reincarnation of a princess from the underworld. Del Toro said he was nervous about casting the lead role, and that finding the 10-year-old Spanish actress was purely accidental. (The film was shot from June–October 2005, when she was 11.) [...] "The {{character}} I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9, and Ivana came in {{and she was a}} little older than the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. But <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> first reading, my wife was crying and the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew that I needed to change the screenplay to accommodate her age." [...] Baquero says that Del Toro sent her lots of comics and fairy tales to help her [...] "get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt". She says she thought the film was [...] "marvelous", and that [...] "at the same time it can bring you pain, and sadness, and scariness, and happiness".|$|E
2500|$|As was {{the custom}} {{of the day in}} her social class, Lady Randolph played a limited role in her sons' upbringing, relying largely upon nannies, {{especially}} Elizabeth Everest. Winston worshipped his mother, writing her numerous letters during his time at school and begging her to visit him, which, however, she rarely did. He wrote about her in My Early Life: 'She shone for me like the evening star. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> dearly – but at a distance'. After he became an adult, they became good friends and strong allies, to the point where Winston regarded her almost as a political mentor, more as a big sister than as a mother. She was well-respected and influential in the highest British social and political circles. She was said to be intelligent, witty, and quick to laughter. It was said that Queen Alexandra especially enjoyed her company, although Jennie had been involved in an affair with her husband, the king, which was well known to Alexandra. Through her family contacts and her extramarital romantic relationships, Jennie greatly helped Lord Randolph's early career, {{as well as that of}} her son Winston. [...] In 1909 when American impresario Charles Frohman became sole manager of The Globe Theatre, the first production was His Borrowed Plumes, written by Lady Randolph Churchill. [...] Although Mrs. Patrick Campbell produced and took the lead role in the play, it was a commercial failure. [...] It was at this point that Mrs. Campbell began an affair with Lady Randolph's then husband, George Cornwallis-West.|$|E
