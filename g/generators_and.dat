40|$|Abstract — Digital data {{transmission}} is the mostly {{used in the}} communication. The {{data transmission}} from source to destination should be without loss of information. This is made possible by using the method of parity <b>generator</b> <b>and</b> parity checker. The parity checker <b>and</b> the parity <b>generator</b> are of two types they are even parity <b>generator</b> <b>and</b> parity checker, odd parity <b>generator</b> <b>and</b> checker. Reversible logic gates compremises various parameters in the data transmission. There are various reversible logic gates {{to meet the needs}} of the parity <b>generator</b> <b>and</b> parity checker. Reversible gates probably reduce the number of gates utilised in the conventional method. The Parity <b>generator</b> <b>and</b> the parity ckecker is effective method to find the error in the destination end. The reversible logic gate called Feynman gate is used in the process which make the data transmissionmuch more effective with no data loss and is simulated using the simulator ’Modelsim’...|$|R

5|$|Amtrak ordered 26 E60s in 1973; 15 on March 26, 1973, and {{a further}} 11 on October 12. The {{total cost of}} the order was $18.4 million. The initial order was for 15 {{locomotives}} with steam <b>generators</b> <b>and</b> 11 with head-end power, but 9 of the first type were switched to using head-end power as Amtrak ramped up acquisition of Amfleet cars. Amtrak anticipated that E60-hauled Amfleet trains could displace both the GG1s and the mechanically-unreliable Metroliners.|$|E
5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody <b>generators)</b> <b>and</b> are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{supplied}} to the ships by five electricity plants. Each plant consisted of four diesel <b>generators</b> <b>and</b> eight turbo-generators. The four diesel generators {{were divided into}} pairs: two provided 150kilowatts each and two supplied 300kW each. The eight turbo-generators were also of mixed capacity; six ran supplied 460kW each and the remaining two provided 230kW each. Total power output was 4,120kW at 220volts.|$|E

A few days after Maemi struck, the United States Agency for International Development sent $50,000 (USD) to the Korean Red Cross. Later, the government of Japan sent ¥9.5million ($85,000 USD) worth of supplies to South Korea, including sleeping mats, <b>generators,</b> <b>and</b> water units. Taiwan also provided $100,000 in aid. The Republic of Korea National Red Cross utilized 700volunteers and 200staff members to distribute food and blankets to 8,190houses, while local offices provided over 5,500meals. Members of Food for the Hungry delivered food and clothing to storm-damaged residents in Masan.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as <b>generators,</b> <b>and</b> then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is {{also used}} in aluminium-silicon cast alloys in order to refine silicon morphology. However, it {{indicated}} a poisoning effect on modification of strontium (Sr). Some bismuth alloys, such as Bi35-Pb37-Sn25, are combined with non-sticking materials such as mica, glass and enamels because they easily wet them allowing to make joints to other parts. Addition of bismuth to caesium enhances the quantum yield of caesium cathodes. Sintering of bismuth and manganese powders at 300°C produces a permanent magnet and magnetostrictive material, which is used in ultrasonic <b>generators</b> <b>and</b> receivers working in the 10–100kHz range and in magnetic memory devices.|$|E

It was released on October 27, 2009 in North America and on October 29, 2009 in Europe. The game is based on turntablism, the act of creating a new musical work from one or more previously recorded songs using record players and sound effect <b>generators,</b> <b>and</b> features 94 remixes of two different songs from a selection of over 100 different songs across numerous genres.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Curie {{recognised}} that {{wounded soldiers}} were best served if operated upon {{as soon as}} possible. She saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons. After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, auxiliary <b>generators,</b> <b>and</b> developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies ("Little Curies"). She became {{the director of the}} Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914. Assisted at first by a military doctor and by her 17-year-old daughter Irène, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals {{in the first year of}} the war. Later, she began training other women as aides.|$|E
5|$|Electrical <b>generators</b> <b>and</b> alternators are {{frequently}} used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E

5|$|In Texas, about 250,000people {{evacuated}} Orange and Jefferson counties. Galveston City Manager Doug Matthews advised {{residents to}} develop an evacuation plan {{in the event that}} the city chose to call for evacuations. The city later decided against ordering an evacuation. School was canceled on August 25 for Beaumont, Port Arthur, and other areas of central Jefferson County, while schools were closed in Dickinson, High Island, Hitchcock, La Marque, Santa Fe, and Texas City on August 26. College of the Mainland, Galveston College, and Texas A University at Galveston were also closed. Emergency management crews in Corpus Christi began testing emergency <b>generators</b> <b>and</b> severe weather gear. The Comal County chapter of the Red Cross placed their disaster alert teams on standby and ready to respond if the hurricane threatened the Corpus Christi area.|$|E
5|$|In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York {{attorney}} Charles F. Peck. The two {{men were}} experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain. Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea, they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1/3 to Tesla, 1/3 to Peck and Brown, and 1/3 to fund development. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, <b>generators,</b> <b>and</b> other devices.|$|E
5|$|New backup oxygen <b>generators</b> <b>and</b> filters {{have been}} {{installed}} on the aircraft. The coughing symptoms {{have been attributed to}} acceleration atelectasis ("collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange"), which may be exacerbated by the F-22's high performance. The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed to be unrelated. On 4 April 2013, the distance and altitude flight restrictions were lifted after the F-22 Combined Test Force and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron determined that breathing restrictions on the pilot were responsible as opposed to an issue with the oxygen provided.|$|E
