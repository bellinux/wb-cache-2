Nisha overhears her parents talking about her marrying into Kailashnath's family and thinks that they are {{discussing}} her marriage to Prem, to which she agrees. Later, at a pre-nuptial ceremony, she finds out that she <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> to marry Rajesh.|$|E
500|$|British {{film critic}} Mark Kermode gave the film a {{positive}} review, saying, [...] "After an initial 20-minute dip, when I thought, 'This <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> to be two-hours of mopey-mopey,' I thought it found its feet." [...] He also excused the film's characterization of Taylor Lautner's character, saying, [...] "The {{sight of the}} buff, young guys running through the forest with their tops off was slightly smirk-inducing. But it's fine. They know what their target-audience is." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of the comic's {{dark humor}} {{is derived from}} its {{contrasts}} with Half-Life 2: in a depressing, dark vision of a conquered humanity's future, Gordon Freeman becomes a hero and savior; the similarly named Gordon Frohman, on the other hand, is just an average person, improbably cheerful {{to the point of}} stupidity, and somewhat naïve as to what <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> on around him. [...] For instance, Frohman fails to realize that his return-addressed letters to Doctor Breen reveal his location, and so result in that location being invaded, bombed, or otherwise compromised.|$|E

500|$|The episode's script parodied {{parents who}} voiced strong {{opposition}} to South Park, portraying them as so invested in fighting the television program that {{they fail to}} pay attention to what <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> on in their children's lives. This is illustrated in the episode when Stan calls his mother seeking help because Death is chasing him, only for his mother to ignore him because she is too busy protesting the Terrance and Phillip show. This is also demonstrated by the line Kyle says, [...] "I think that parents only get so offended by television because they rely on it as a babysitter and the sole educator of their kids." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Death" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The episode, along with the Terrance and Phillip show, were inspired by early criticism that South Park was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation. The script portrays the parents as so invested in protesting television programs, they fail to pay any attention to what <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> on in their children's lives. They seem to want to make television clean and wholesome so the entertainment industry can raise their kids so they themselves don't have to make the time and effort to be full-time parents. The episode also advocates against censorship and addresses the morality and ethics of euthanasia.|$|E
500|$|The Ice King is {{oblivious}} {{to his former}} self, and Marceline begins looking through the Ice King's scrapbook pages to show him evidence of his former life. Among the pages {{is a picture of}} a young Marceline, with a message to her from a thousand years ago scrawled on the back. The message, written by Simon before his mind was completely consumed by the magic of the crown, asks Marceline to forgive him for whatever he does under the crown's influence. The Ice King fails to understand the context, and believes that he has written not a note of apology but lyrics, and attempts to add music to his [...] "song". Overcome by emotion, Marceline cries and begins singing along while the Ice King plays drums, oblivious as to what <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> on.|$|E

I don't want to go by what everyone else sees – I {{want to see what}} <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> on, and share in the reaction of the characters {{at the same time as}} them". However, by the twelfth episode, he said that the scene in which Victor cries was the proof he wanted: [...] "If the kiss is the initial spark, and the rings the visible sign of love, then the tears are proof that you don't want it to end. I have been saying all the time that what I wanted was text rather than subtext – but in end, I think the subtext did actually pay off." ...|$|E
500|$|The NSC meeting then heard Phillips' bleak {{prognosis}} of {{the situation}} in the Mekong Delta. He claimed that the Strategic Hamlet Program was a shambles in the delta, stating that they were [...] "being chewed to pieces by the Viet Cong". When it was noted that Phillips had recently witnessed a battle in the delta, Kennedy asked Phillips for his assessment. Phillips replied: [...] "Well, I don't like to contradict General Krulak, but I have to tell you, Mr. President, that we're not winning the war, particularly in the delta. The troops are paralysed, they're in the barracks, and this is what <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> on in one province that's right next to Saigon." [...] Phillips asserted that removing Nhu {{was the only way to}} improve the situation. Phillips asserted that the only means of removing Nhu was to bring in Colonel Edward Lansdale, the CIA operative who had consolidated Diệm's position a decade earlier, a proposal that Kennedy dismissed. Phillips recommended three measures: ...|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the poem}} is {{concerned}} primarily with the irregular musings of the narrator, {{it can be difficult}} to interpret. Laurence Perrine wrote, [...] " [...] presents the apparently random thoughts going through a person's head within a certain time interval, in which the transitional links are psychological rather than logical". This stylistic choice makes it difficult to determine exactly what is literal and what is symbolic. On the surface, [...] "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" [...] relays the thoughts of a sexually frustrated middle-aged man who wants to say something but is afraid to do so, and ultimately does not. The dispute, however, lies in to whom Prufrock is speaking, whether he <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> anywhere, what he wants to say, and to what the various images refer.|$|E

Lord Treasurer quarrelled with me at Court for being four days without dining with him; so I dined there to-day, and he has at last fallen in with my project (as he calls it) of coining halfpence and farthings, with devices, like medals, in honour of the Queen, every year {{changing}} the device.

60|$|These {{examples}} show us {{that the}} kind of change suggested above <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> on, and has presumably always been going on in nature throughout the long geological epochs during which the development of flowers has been progressing. The two great modes of gaining increased vigour and fertility--intercrossing and dispersal over wider areas--have been resorted to again and again, under the pressure of a constant struggle for existence and the need for adaptation to ever-changing conditions. During all the modifications that ensued, useless parts were reduced or suppressed, owing to the absence of selection and the principle of economy of growth; and thus at each fresh adaptation some rudiments of old structures were re-developed, but not unfrequently in a different form and for a distinct purpose.|$|E

6000|$|... [88] These {{figures are}} merely {{used to give}} {{an idea of the}} rate at which {{denudation}} <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> on now; but if no elevatory forces were at work, the rate of denudation would certainly diminish as the mountains were lowered and the slope of the ground everywhere rendered flatter. This would follow not only from the diminished power of rain and rivers, but because the climate would become more uniform, the rainfall probably less, and no rocky peaks would be left to be fractured and broken up by the action of frosts. It is certain, however, that no continent has ever remained long subject to the influences of denudation alone, for, as we have seen in our sixth chapter, elevation and depression have always been going on in one part or other of the surface.|$|E

No highwayman stopped our traveller on Blackheath. Yonder are the gleaming domes of Greenwich, canopied with woods. There is the famous Thames, with its countless shipping; there actually is the Tower of London. [...] "Look, Gumbo! There is the Tower!" [...] "Yes, master," [...] says Gumbo, who has {{never heard of the}} Tower; but Harry has, and remembers how he has read about it in Howell's Medulla, and how he and his brother used to play at the Tower, and he thinks with delight now, how he <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> to see the armour and the jewels and the lions. They pass through Southwark and over that famous London Bridge, which was all covered with houses like a street two years ago. Now there is only a single gate left, and that is coming down. Then the chaise rolls through the city; and, [...] "Look, Gumbo, that is Saint Paul's!" [...] "Yes, master; Saint Paul's," [...] says Gumbo, obsequiously, but little struck by the beauties of the architecture. And so by the well-known course we reach the Temple, and Gumbo and his master look up with awe at the rebel heads on Temple Bar.|$|E
60|$|Little Pen {{has been}} in the utmost {{excitement}} lately about his pony, which Robert <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> to buy for him. I am said to be the spoiler, but mark! I will confess to you that, considering how we run to and fro, it never would have entered into the extravagance of my love to set up a pony for Penini. When I heard of it first, I opened my eyes wide, only no amount of discretion on my part could enable me to take part against both Pen and Robert in a matter which pleases Pen. I hope they won't combine to give me an Austrian daughter-in-law when Peni is sixteen. So I say 'Yes,' 'Yes,' 'Certainly,' and the pony is to be bought, and carried to Rome (fancy that!), and we are to hunt up some small Italian princes and princesses to ride with him at Rome (I object to Hatty Hosmer, who has been thrown thirty times[70]). In fact, Pen has been very coaxing about the pony. He has beset Robert in private and then, as privately, entreated me, 'if papa spoke to me about the pony, not to discourage him.' So I discouraged nobody, but am rather triumphantly glad, upon the whole, that we have done such a very foolish, extravagant thing.|$|E

60|$|Having {{got rid of}} {{the belief}} in chance and the disbelief in design, as in no sense {{appurtenances}} of Evolution, the third libel upon that doctrine, that it is anti-theistic, might perhaps be left to shift for itself. But the persistence with which many people refuse to draw the plainest consequences from the propositions they profess to accept, renders it advisable to remark that the doctrine of Evolution is neither Anti-theistic nor Theistic. It simply has no more to do with Theism than the first book of Euclid has. It is quite certain that a normal fresh-laid egg contains neither cock nor hen; and it is also as certain as any proposition in physics or morals, that if such an egg is kept under proper conditions for three weeks, a cock or hen chicken will be found in it. It is also quite certain that if the shell were transparent {{we should be able to}} watch the formation of the young fowl, day by day, by a process of evolution, from a microscopic cellular germ to its full size and complication of structure. Therefore Evolution, in the strictest sense, <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> on in this and analogous millions and millions of instances, wherever living creatures exist. Therefore, to borrow an argument from Butler, as that which now happens must be consistent with the attributes of the Deity, if such a Being exists, Evolution must be consistent with those attributes. And, if so, the evolution of the universe, which is neither more nor less explicable than that of a chicken, must also be consistent with them. The doctrine of Evolution, therefore, does not even come into contact with Theism, considered as a philosophical doctrine. That with which it does collide, and with which it is absolutely inconsistent, is the conception of creation, which theological speculators have based upon the history narrated in the opening of the book of Genesis.|$|E
