30|$|<b>Event</b> {{reputation}} system (ERS): The <b>event</b> {{reputation system}} (ERS) prevents inaccurate traffic messages in VANETs. A dynamic reputation system {{is used to}} determine the incoming traffic trustworthiness to the driver. In this scheme, the vehicle gets enough reputation from inside sensors and received messages. When enough reputation is received, then the traffic warning will be broadcasting to other vehicles in the network. The scheme is dependent on two parameters: <b>event</b> reputation value and <b>event</b> confidence list. <b>Event</b> reputation system consists of three interfaces and four functionalities. One is <b>event</b> table storage for received messages or <b>event</b> from on-board unit sensors. The <b>event</b> table consists of <b>event</b> identity, type of <b>event,</b> time stamp of <b>event,</b> <b>event</b> location, <b>event</b> transmission range, <b>event</b> reputation value and <b>event</b> confidence value list. The <b>event</b> table stores each <b>event</b> separately and set <b>event</b> reputation value. The ERS uses aggregative <b>event</b> observation mechanism and reputation adoption mechanism. The <b>event</b> confidence threshold and <b>event</b> reputation threshold assess <b>event</b> intensity and reliability at the same time. The limitation of ERS is that <b>event</b> reputation value is low in high speed because of the sensor capability (minimum detection). The <b>event</b> confidence is small in low density. The other factors like <b>event</b> duration and transmission range also have an effect on ERS [84].|$|R

[...]) {{when the}} given ERS {{receives}} a traffic warning message from another vehicle, the ERS adds the <b>event</b> reputation {{value in the}} received message into the field of <b>event</b> reputation value at the same <b>event</b> record in the <b>event</b> table or creates a new <b>event</b> record in the <b>event</b> table. <b>Event</b> confidence value indicates the reliability extent of a traffic <b>event</b> and the value {{is the number of}} distinct vehicles whose messages, regarding to the same traffic <b>event,</b> have been received by the given vehicle's ERS. In addition, the definition of <b>event</b> confidence list is a string list of the identities of distinct vehicles which encounter the same traffic <b>event.</b> When a given vehicle encounters a traffic <b>event</b> and detects it, the given ERS will append its vehicle's identity into the <b>event</b> confidence list field at the corresponding <b>event</b> entry. Similarly, when a given vehicle receives a traffic warning message, the content of <b>event</b> confidence list in the message will be appended in the <b>event</b> confidence list field at the corresponding <b>event</b> entry.

30|$|The four {{functions}} {{supported in}} the ERS are <b>event</b> management, reputation value adaptation module, <b>event</b> reputation value collection, and <b>event</b> confidence list collection. We will introduce {{the first two}} functions in the next subsection. For the two collection functions, we have briefly illustrated how these functions work as previously stated in this subsection. Here we want to introduce two important thresholds used in ERS, that is, <b>event</b> reputation threshold and <b>event</b> confidence threshold. <b>Event</b> reputation threshold is used {{to set up the}} barrier for <b>event</b> intensity. If the <b>event</b> reputation value of a traffic <b>event</b> is higher than the predefined <b>event</b> reputation threshold, then the intensity of this <b>event</b> is sufficiently strong enough to indicate the continuous existence of this <b>event.</b> Otherwise, the <b>event</b> might not still exist anymore, even though it did occur sometime before. <b>Event</b> confidence threshold is used to set up the bottom line for <b>event</b> reliability. If the <b>event</b> confidence value of a traffic <b>event</b> is higher than the predefined <b>event</b> confidence threshold, then it indicates that there were sufficient amounts of vehicles that encountered the same traffic <b>event</b> and the occurrence plausibility of this <b>event</b> is much more reliable. By properly setting these thresholds and other configurable system parameters, the ERS can provide accurate and reliable traffic information to vehicle drivers. If a given ERS detects the <b>event</b> reputation value and the <b>event</b> confidence value of a traffic <b>event</b> is over the corresponding <b>event</b> reputation threshold and <b>event</b> confidence threshold, which indicate that the traffic <b>event</b> really exists and is still there, the ERS will send this <b>event</b> information through the user interface to notify the driver {{and at the same time}} broadcast a traffic warning message with current <b>event</b> reputation value and the corresponding confidence list to nearby vehicles.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{formally}} specified <b>event</b> specification language (Solicitor). Solicitor {{is suitable for}} real-time systems, since it results in resource-predictable and efficient <b>event</b> monitors. In <b>event</b> monitoring, <b>event</b> expressions defined in an <b>event</b> specification language control the monitoring by matching incoming streams of <b>event</b> occurrences against the <b>event</b> expressions. When an <b>event</b> expression has {{a complete set of}} matching <b>event</b> occurrences, the <b>event</b> type that this expression defines has occurred. Each <b>event</b> expression is specified by combining contributing <b>event</b> types with <b>event</b> operators such as sequence, conjunction, disjunction; contributing <b>event</b> types may be primitive, representing happenings of interest in a system, or composite, specified by <b>event</b> expressions. The formal specification of Solicitor is based on a formal schema that separates two important aspects of an <b>event</b> expression; these aspects are <b>event</b> operators and <b>event</b> contexts. The <b>event</b> operators aspect addresses the relative constraints between contributing <b>event</b> occurrences, whereas the <b>event</b> contexts aspect addresses the selection of <b>event</b> occurrences from an <b>event</b> stream with respect to <b>event</b> occurrences that are used or invalidated during <b>event</b> monitoring. The formal schema also contains an abstract model of <b>event</b> monitoring. Given this formal specification, we present realization issues of, a time complexity study of, as well as a proof of limited resource requirements of <b>event</b> monitoring. We propose an architecture for resource-predictable and efficient <b>event</b> monitoring. In particular, this architecture meets the requirements of realtime systems by defining how <b>event</b> monitoring and tasks are associated. A declarative way of specifying this association is proposed within our architecture. Moreover, an efficient memory management scheme for <b>event</b> composition is presented. This scheme meets the requirements of <b>event</b> monitoring in distributed systems. This architecture has been validated by implementing an executable component prototype {{that is part of the}} DeeDS prototype. The results of the time complexity study are validated by experiments. Our experiments corroborate the theory in terms of complexity classes of <b>event</b> composition in different <b>event</b> contexts. However, the experimental platform is not representative of operational real-time systems and, thus, the constants derived from our experiments cannot be used for such systems...|$|R

30|$|Configuration of <b>event</b> {{reputation}} {{threshold and}} <b>event</b> confidence threshold in an ERS {{are dependent on}} the sensor capability of a vehicle and the type characteristics of a traffic <b>event.</b> In general, there are some design criteria and guidelines to help vehicle manufacturers or drivers determine these two thresholds. For example, when instant notification of <b>event</b> occurrence {{is more important than}} <b>event</b> reliability and <b>event</b> continuity in situations such as emergency braking <b>event</b> and speed decrease <b>event,</b> both thresholds should be set to a lower value. On the contrary, if <b>event</b> reliability and <b>event</b> continuity are more important than instant notification of <b>event</b> occurrence in situations such as vehicle accident <b>event</b> and traffic jam <b>event,</b> both thresholds should be set to a higher value. Therefore, we suggest that different pairs of <b>event</b> reputation threshold and <b>event</b> confidence threshold should be preconfigured in an ERS based on various <b>event</b> types and sensor capability of vehicle.|$|R
