40|$|MOTIVATION: There are a {{large number}} of {{computational}} programs freely available to bioinformaticians via a client/server, web-based environment. However, the client interface to these tools (typically an html <b>form</b> <b>page)</b> cannot be customized from the client side as it is created by the service provider. The <b>form</b> <b>page</b> is usually generic enough to cater {{for a wide range of}} users. However, this implies that a user cannot set as 'default' advanced program parameters on the form or even customize the interface to his/her specific requirements or preferences. Currently, there is a lack of end-user interface environments that can be modified by the user when accessing computer programs available on a remote server running on an intranet or over the Internet. RESULTS: We have implemented a client/server system called ORBIT (Online Researcher's Bioinformatics Interface Tools) where individual clients can have interfaces created and customized to command-line-driven, server-side programs. Thus, Internet-based interfaces can be tailored to a user's specific bioinformatic needs. As interfaces are created on the client machine independent of the server, there can be different interfaces to the same server-side program to cater for different parameter settings. The interface customization is relatively quick (between 10 and 60 min) and all client interfaces are integrated into a single modular environment which will run on any computer platform supporting Java. The system has been developed to allow for a number of future enhancements and features. ORBIT represents an important advance in the way researchers gain access to bioinformatics tools on the Internet...|$|E

40|$|SENuke, {{have been}} widely used by attackers to perform illicit activities, such as massively {{registering}} accounts, sending spam, and automating web-based games. Although the technique of CAPTCHA has been widely used to defend against web bots, it requires users to solve some explicit challenges, which is typically interactive and intrusive, resulting in decreased usability. In this paper, we design a novel, non-intrusive moving-target defense system, NOMAD, to complement existing solutions. NO-MAD prevents web bots from automating web resource access by randomizing HTML elements while not affecting normal users. Specifically, to prevent web bots uniquely identifying HTML elements for later automation, NOMAD randomizes name/id parameter values of HTML elements in each HTTP <b>form</b> <b>page.</b> We evaluate NOMAD against five powerful state-of-the-art web bots on several popular open source web platforms.

40|$|XQForms is {{the first}} {{generator}} of Web-based query forms and reports for XML data. XQForms takes as input (i) XML Schemas that model the data to be queried and presented, (ii) declarative specifications, called annotations, of {{the logic of the}} query forms and reports that will be generated, and (iii) a set of template presentation libraries. The output is a set of query forms and reports that provide automated query construction and report formatting in order for the end users to query and browse the underlying XML data. Thus XQForms separates content (given by the XML Schema of the data), query form logic (specified by the annotations) and presentation of the forms and reports. The system architecture is modular and consists of four main components: (a) a collection of query form controls that incorporate query capabilities and allow parameter passing from the end users via the <b>form</b> <b>page.</b> A set of query form controls makes up a query form. (b) An annotation scheme for binding these controls to data elements of the XML Schema and for specifying their properties, (c) a compiler for creating the HTML representation of the query forms, and (d) a runtime engine that constructs and executes the queries against the XML data and renders the query results to create the reports.

40|$|The FORWARD project, {{as well as}} its app 2 you predecessor, is a Do-It-Yourself web {{application}} platform that enables non-programmers to create custom forms-driven workflow applications, where users with potentially different roles and rights interact. Our experience with the commercialized version of app 2 you (app 2 you. com) shows that formsdriven workflow applications exhibit a viable balance between application scope and ease of specification. The proposed demo uses a real-world application, the TechCrunch 50 2008 reviewing application, to illustrate key specification techniques the Do-It-Yourself design facility provides to nonprogrammer application creators. The demo audience will also have hands-on experience building applications without any programming. 1. DIY APPLICATION PLATFORMS The app 2 you and FORWARD projects [2, 3] provide Do-It-Yourself (DIY) application platforms that enable nonprogrammers to rapidly create and evolve forms-driven workflow applications customized to their data and process needs. A DIY platform provides an application design facility (also called application specification mechanism) where a non-programmer application creator can specify the application by manipulating visible aspects of the application’s pages or by setting configuration options. A simple, back-inthe- 80 s example of DIY application creation is form builders, where the application creator introduces form elements into a <b>form</b> <b>page.</b> The platform, in response, creates a corresponding database schema. Actions on the form lead to SQL INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements.

40|$|The Midwest Pediatric Pacemaker {{registry}} {{which provides}} a large data-base of information concerning pacemaker implantation in children relies upon printed articles and meeting presentations for dissemination of collected information and upon member institutions to complete and mail printed forms for data submission. This process increases the time necessary for data submission and slows dissemination of pooled data to the pediatric pacing community. With increasing Internet access by centers involved in pediatric pacing, {{and the development of}} the World Wide Web (WWW), use of the WWW was explored to evaluate its potential for information dissemination and acquisition. Hypertext mark-up language (HTML) documents of composite Registry statistics, patient demographics with initial implantation indication, and generator implantation and electrode utilization information were made available on the Internet by publishing it on the WWW. Documents presented data both in textual and graphical form and were organized by topic on different pages to allow selective access directly the data needed. The graphs presented can be downloaded in GIF format. Use of the easily prepared HTML documents allows for frequent updating of information with rapid access by centers involved in pediatric pacing. In addition utilizing the forms capability of WWW browsers, Pacemaker Registry information can be submitted on-line. The <b>form</b> <b>page</b> is displayed and the information directly entered. Information entry is accomplished byfilling in character fields, check boxes and free text fields. The form is then automatically sent to the WWW server which forwards it to the Registry Director for database entry. It is never stored on the public access WWW server, ensuring patient confidentiality. For users without a forms capable WWW browser, a file containing the submission forms is also provided that can be downloaded. Use of the WWW and Internet provides more rapid dissemination and collection of Registry information shortening the period between data collection and data review by centers involved in pediatric pacing which should improve the quality of care delivered to children requiring permanent pacing. Use of WWW can provide a rapid means of medical data dissemination and communication...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{our efforts}} on preventing the web bots to illegitimately access web resources. As the first technique, we present SEMAGE (SEmantically MAtching imaGEs), a new image-based CAPTCHA that capitalizes {{on the human}} ability to define and comprehend image content and to establish semantic relationships between them. As the second technique, we present NOID - a "NOn-Intrusive Web Bot Defense system" that aims at creating a three tiered defence system against web automation programs or web bots. NOID is a server side technique and prevents the web bots from accessing web resources by inherently hiding the HTML elements of interest by randomization and obfuscation in the HTML responses. A SEMAGE challenge asks a user to select semantically related images from a given image set. SEMAGE has a two-factor design where in order to pass a challenge the user is required {{to figure out the}} content of each image and then understand and identify semantic relationship between a subset of them. Most of the current state-of-the-art image-based systems like Assira only require the user to solve the first level, i. e., image recognition. Utilizing the semantic correlation between images to create more secure and user-friendly challenges makes SEMAGE novel. SEMAGE does not suffer from limitations of traditional image-based approaches such as lacking customization and adaptability. SEMAGE unlike the current Text based systems is also very user friendly with a high fun factor. We conduct a first of its kind large-scale user study involving 174 users to gauge and compare accuracy and usability of SEMAGE with existing state-of-the-art CAPTCHA systems like reCAPTCHA (text-based) and Asirra (image-based). The user study further reinstates our points and shows that users achieve high accuracy using our system and consider our system to be fun and easy. We also design a novel server-side and non-intrusive web bot defense system, NOID, to prevent web bots from accessing web resources by inherently hiding and randomizing HTML elements. Specifically, to prevent web bots uniquely identifying HTML elements for later automation, NOID randomizes name/id parameter values of essential HTML elements such as "input textbox", "textarea" and "submit button" in each HTTP <b>form</b> <b>page.</b> In addition, to prevent powerful web bots from identifying special user-action HTML elements by analyzing the content of their accompanied "label text" HTML tags, we enhance NOID by adding a component, Label Concealer, which hides label indicators by replacing "label text" HTML tags with randomized images. To further prevent more powerful web bots identifying HTML elements by recognizing their relative positions or surrounding elements in the web pages, we enhance NOID by adding another component, Element Trapper, which obfuscates important HTML elements' surroundings by adding decoy elements without compromising usability. We evaluate NOID against five powerful state-of-the-art web bots including XRumer, SENuke, Magic Submitter, Comment Blaster, and UWCS on several popular open source web platforms including phpBB, Simple Machine Forums (SMF), and Wordpress. According to our evaluation, NOID can prevent all these web bots automatically sending spam on these web platforms with reasonable overhead...|$|E
