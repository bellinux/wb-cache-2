5|$|For system {{efficacy}} and reliability, aircraft transmissions made {{in response to}} a signal from a satellite are sent in timed slots referenced to the time the signal from the satellite arrived, using the slotted ALOHA protocol. The time that the signal is sent from the <b>ground</b> station begins the time slot. The burst timing offset (BTO) is the time difference between the start of the time slot and the start of the transmission received from the aircraft; it equals twice the distance (for the <b>ground</b> station's signal then aircraft's response) from the <b>ground</b> station to the satellite to the aircraft plus the time the aircraft's SDU takes between receiving the signal and responding (the SDU bias) and the delay between the time the signal arrives at the <b>ground</b> station and the time it is processed (when the BTO value is logged; the <b>ground</b> station bias). The satellite's location is known, thus the distance from the satellite to the <b>ground</b> station can be calculated, while the combined bias of the SDU and <b>ground</b> station is relatively constant and can be calculated from signals exchanged earlier in the flight while it was on the <b>ground</b> at KLIA, thus leaving the distance between the aircraft and satellite as the only variable.|$|E

40|$|We review <b>grounding</b> {{issues that}} {{influence}} the scientific usefulness of any biomedical multiscale model (MSM). Groundings are the collection of units, dimensions, and/or objects to which a variable or model constituent refers. To date, models that primarily use continuous mathematics rely heavily on absolute <b>grounding,</b> whereas those that primarily use discrete software paradigms (e. g., object-oriented, agent-based, actor) typically employ relational <b>grounding.</b> We review <b>grounding</b> issues and identify strategies to address them. We maintain that <b>grounding</b> issues should be addressed {{at the start of}} any MSM project and should be reevaluated throughout the model development process. We make the following points. <b>Grounding</b> decisions influence model flexibility, adaptability, and thus reusability. <b>Grounding</b> choices should be influenced by measures, uncertainty, system information, and the nature of available validation data. Absolute <b>grounding</b> complicates the process of combining models to form larger models unless all are <b>grounded</b> absolutely. Relational <b>grounding</b> facilitates referent knowledge embodiment within computational mechanisms but requires separate model-to-referent mappings. Absolute <b>grounding</b> can simplify integration by forcing common units and, hence, a common integration target, but context change may require model reengineering. Relational <b>grounding</b> enables synthesis of large, composite (multi-module) models that can be robust to context changes. Because biological components have varying degrees of autonomy, corresponding components in MSMs need to do the same. Relational <b>grounding</b> facilitates achieving such autonomy. Biomimetic analogues designed to facilitate translational research and development must have long lifecycles. Exploring mechanisms of normal-to-disease transition requires model components that are <b>grounded</b> relationally. Multi-paradigm modeling requires both hyperspatial and relational <b>grounding...</b>|$|R
