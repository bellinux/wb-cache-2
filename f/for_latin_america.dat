Severe flooding occurred in the northern region, which washed away more than 25entire villages. In San Pedro Sula in northwestern Honduras, flooding covered several neighborhoods and the international airport. Near the coast, high waves destroyed hotels and houses while swollen rivers flooded nearby areas. Damage was heaviest in Colón and Atlántida departments. In the latter department, the Cangrejal River left heavy damage along its path after it flooded. In Choluteca and Valle departments in the southern portion of the country, river flooding swept away houses and affected neighborhoods.|$|E
