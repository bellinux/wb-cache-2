5|$|The {{latter part}} of the 20th century saw the rise of multi-volume vampire epics. The first of these was Gothic romance writer Marilyn Ross's Barnabas Collins series (1966–71), loosely based on the {{contemporary}} American TV series Dark Shadows. It also set the trend for seeing vampires as poetic tragic heroes rather than as the more traditional <b>embodiment</b> of evil. This formula was followed in novelist Anne Rice's highly popular and influential Vampire Chronicles (1976–2003).|$|E

5|$|Chhinnamasta is {{a goddess}} of contradictions. She symbolises both aspects of Devi: a life-giver and a life-taker. She is {{considered}} both {{a symbol of}} sexual self-control and an <b>embodiment</b> of sexual energy, depending upon interpretation. She represents death, temporality, and destruction as well as life, immortality, and recreation. The goddess conveys spiritual self-realization and the awakening of the kundalini– spiritual energy. The legends of Chhinnamasta emphasise her self-sacrifice– sometimes coupled with a maternal element– sexual dominance, and self-destructive fury.|$|E
5|$|Humanity survives in the aftermath, but {{the world}} {{experiences}} an ice age outside of Kazamatsuri.

Above all other deities is Ao, the Overlord. Ao does not sanction worshipers and distances himself from mortals.

5|$|No {{members of}} the general public were {{permitted}} on the island during the ceremonies, which were reserved entirely for dignitaries. The only females granted access were Bartholdi's wife and de Lesseps's granddaughter; officials stated that they feared women might be injured in the crush of people. The restriction offended area suffragists, who chartered a boat and got as close as they could to the island. The group's leaders made speeches applauding the <b>embodiment</b> of Liberty as a woman and advocating women's right to vote. A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 because of poor weather.|$|E
5|$|Representations of America as {{a female}} Native American, or Indian princess, dated back to the 16thcentury; cartographers would place a native woman, often wearing a {{feathered}} headdress, upon their version of the North American continent.

5|$|Shaktism's {{focus on}} the Divine Feminine does not imply a {{rejection}} of masculine. It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine. Devi {{is considered to be}} the cosmos itself – she is the <b>embodiment</b> of energy, matter and soul, the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the masculine and the feminine are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.|$|E
