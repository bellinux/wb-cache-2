5|$|The Veterans Committee {{election}} process was revised in July 2007. With the 2007 rules changes, the composite ballot was {{split into two}} separate ballots—one for managers and umpires {{and the other for}} <b>executives.</b> Also, the voting membership of the Committee, which previously included all living members of the Hall, was reduced to include just a handful of those members, plus additional <b>executives</b> and sportswriters. Voting for both the managers/umpires and <b>executives</b> ballots, which now takes place prior to inductions in even-numbered years, began with the 2008 class of inductees, when two managers and three <b>executives</b> were elected. To be eligible, managers and umpires must be retired for at least five years, or for at least six months if they are age 65 or older, while <b>executives</b> must be either retired or at least age 65.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Schaefer, {{many members}} of RKO's board of {{governors}} did not like Welles or the control that his contract gave him. However such board members as Nelson Rockefeller and NBC chief David Sarnoff were sympathetic to Welles. Throughout production Welles had problems with these <b>executives</b> not respecting his contract's stipulation of non-interference and several spies arrived on set to report what they saw to the <b>executives.</b> When the <b>executives</b> would sometimes arrive on set unannounced the entire cast and crew would suddenly start playing softball until they left. Before official shooting began the <b>executives</b> intercepted all copies of the script and delayed their delivery to Welles. They had one copy sent to their office in New York, resulting in it being leaked to press.|$|E

5|$|A Historical Overview Committee of sportswriters {{appointed}} by the BBWAA's Board of Directors met to develop a ballot of 10 managers and umpires. The managers/umpires list was then submitted to a panel composed of Hall of Fame members, <b>executives</b> and veteran media members for a final vote. A separate ballot of 10 <b>executives</b> was developed by a panel including <b>executives,</b> players and writers, which was the same committee which finally voted in that area. The final ballots were released in November 2009. Each panel member was allowed to vote for up to four individuals on each ballot, and each candidate who received 75% of the vote from either panel was elected; therefore, a maximum of five inductions were possible from each ballot. Voting was conducted at baseball's winter meetings in Indianapolis on December 6, 2009, with the results announced the next day; {{as was the case}} with the 2008 class of inductees, the Committee met to discuss the candidates, although the previous three elections had been conducted by mail.|$|E
