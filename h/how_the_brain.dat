5|$|Neuroanthropology is {{the study}} of the {{relationship}} between culture and the brain.

Cultural differences and their relation to brain development and structure are researched in different fields.|$|E
5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, all that matters is {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E

25|$|Decades of {{research}} {{have shown that}} substantial changes occur in the lowest neocortical processing areas, and that these changes can profoundly alter the pattern of neuronal activation in response to experience. Neuroscientific research indicates that experience can actually change both the brain's physical structure (anatomy) and functional organization (physiology). , neuroscientists {{are engaged in a}} reconciliation of critical-period studies (demonstrating the immutability of the brain after development) with the more recent research showing <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> can, and does, change in response to hitherto unsuspected stimuli.|$|E
25|$|The first {{electronic}} autonomous robots {{with complex}} behaviour {{were created by}} William Grey Walter of the Burden Neurological Institute at Bristol, England in 1948 and 1949. He wanted to prove that rich connections between {{a small number of}} brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, named Elmer and Elsie, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement. The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis, by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power.|$|E

25|$|MRI is {{the investigative}} tool {{of choice for}} {{neurological}} cancers, as it has better resolution than CT and offers better visualization of the posterior fossa. The contrast provided between grey and white matter makes MRI {{the best choice for}} many conditions of the central nervous system, including demyelinating diseases, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, infectious diseases, and epilepsy. Since many images are taken milliseconds apart, it shows <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> responds to different stimuli, enabling researchers to study both the functional and structural brain abnormalities in psychological disorders. MRI also is used in mri-guided stereotactic surgery and radiosurgery for treatment of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations, and other surgically treatable conditions using a device known as the N-localizer.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{enrichment}} {{is concerned}} with <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> {{is affected by the}} stimulation of its information processing provided by its surroundings (including the opportunity to interact socially). Brains in richer, more-stimulating environments, have increased numbers of synapses, and the dendrite arbors upon which they reside are more complex. This effect happens particularly during neurodevelopment, but also to a lesser degree in adulthood. With extra synapses there is also increased synapse activity and so increased size and number of glial energy-support cells. Capillary vasculation also is greater to provide the neurons and glial cells with extra energy. The neuropil (neurons, glial cells, capillaries, combined together) expands making the cortex thicker. There may also exist (at least in rodents) more neurons.|$|E
25|$|Heightened brain {{plasticity}} in infants impacts later language development. Recent {{studies show that}} even brief exposure to a language in infancy changes <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> processes a second-language acquisition. Participants in the studies who had transient language exposure as an infant or were multilingual showed greater brain activation in non-verbal working memory patterns, compared to monolingual speakers. The measure of uncommitted neural circuitry in infants can be accounted for {{in the perception of}} nonnative language at early stages of language acquisition. Research has shown that infants who show proficiency in nonnative phonetic perception at 7 months have slower language development than those who show proficiency in native phonetic perception. This research supports the Native Language Magnet/Neural Commitment Theory originally proposed by Patricia K. Kuhl.|$|E

40|$|The {{recent work}} on speech and vocal sound {{processing}} by <b>the</b> human <b>brain</b> finds itself {{at a crossroads}} with the studies in non-human primates on the neurobiological basis of vocal communication. Speech is a recent evolutionary adaptation, so direct animal homologs of the neural systems supporting speech perception are not expected. However, vocal expressions are richly informative for many social animals. Thus, <b>the</b> interest in <b>how</b> <b>the</b> human <b>brain</b> is processing <b>the</b> speaker‘s identity and affective aspects of the human voice, including the stimulus-bound aspects of speech, may be approached from an evolutionary perspective. From the other side, comparative biologists have started {{to close the gap}} between animal and human data by using the same noninvasive imaging techniques as those applied to <b>the</b> human <b>brain,</b> to study <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of animals. Relying on the same techniques facilitates cross-species comparisons, and provides links to invasive studies of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> processes at <b>the</b> neuronal level. In this chapter, we consider <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of primates analyze the features in vocal sounds, focusing in particular on the correspondence between the auditory cortex processes in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of monkeys, apes and man...|$|R
25|$|Neurolinguistics is {{the study}} of the {{structures}} in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics, and is focused on investigating <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using aphasiology, brain imaging, electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language.|$|E
25|$|Psycholinguistics or {{psychology}} of language {{is the study}} of the psychological and neurobiological factors that enable humans to acquire, use, comprehend and produce language. The discipline is mainly concerned with the mechanisms in which languages are processed and represented in the brain. Initial forays into psycholinguistics were largely philosophical or educational schools of thought, due mainly to their location in departments other than applied sciences (e.g., cohesive data on how the human brain functioned). Modern research makes use of biology, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, and information science to study <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> processes language, and less so the known processes of social sciences, human development, communication theories and infant development, among others. There are a number of subdisciplines with non-invasive techniques for studying the neurological workings of the brain; for example, neurolinguistics has become a field in its own right.|$|E
25|$|Neuropsychology is {{the study}} of the {{structure}} and function of the brain as they relate to specific psychological processes and behaviours. It is an experimental field of psychology that aims to understand how behavior and cognition are influenced by brain functioning and is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of behavioral and cognitive effects of neurological disorders. Whereas classical neurology focuses on the physiology of the nervous system and classical psychology is largely divorced from it, neuropsychology seeks to discover <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> correlates with the mind. It thus shares concepts and concerns with neuropsychiatry and with behavioral neurology in general. The term neuropsychology has been applied to lesion studies in humans and animals. It has also been applied to efforts to record electrical activity from individual cells (or groups of cells) in higher primates (including some studies of human patients). It makes use of neuroscience, and shares an information processing view of the mind with cognitive psychology and cognitive science.|$|E

25|$|In Now You See It: <b>How</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brain</b> Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn Cathy Davidson {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} attention blindness: humans perceive {{only a fraction of}} everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the multi-task oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic neurological feature of the human brain. In the introduction of Now You See It, Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see someone in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax as she watched the tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla.|$|E
25|$|Crick {{hoped he}} might aid {{progress}} in neuroscience by promoting constructive interactions between specialists {{from the many}} different subdisciplines concerned with consciousness. He even collaborated with neurophilosophers such as Patricia Churchland. In 1983, {{as a result of}} their studies of computer models of neural networks, Crick and Mitchison proposed that the function of REM sleep is to remove certain modes of interactions in networks of cells in the mammalian cerebral cortex; they called this hypothetical process 'reverse learning' or 'unlearning'. In the final phase of his career, Crick established a collaboration with Christof Koch that lead to publication of a series of articles on consciousness during the period spanning from 1990 to 2005. Crick made the strategic decision to focus his theoretical investigation of consciousness on <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> generates visual awareness within a few hundred milliseconds of viewing a scene. Crick and Koch proposed that consciousness seems so mysterious because it involves very short-term memory processes that are as yet poorly understood. Crick also published a book describing how neurobiology had reached a mature enough stage so that consciousness could be the subject of a unified effort to study it at the molecular, cellular and behavioural levels. Crick's book The Astonishing Hypothesis made the argument that neuroscience now had the tools required to begin a scientific study of how brains produce conscious experiences. Crick was skeptical about the value of computational models of mental function that are not based on details about brain structure and function.|$|E
