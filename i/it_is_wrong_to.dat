25|$|Special {{relativity}} {{does not}} prohibit this.

25|$|Calvin {{criticized the}} use of certain {{passages}} of scripture invoked by people opposed to the charging of interest. He reinterpreted some of these passages, and suggested that others {{of them had been}} rendered irrelevant by changed conditions. He also dismissed the argument (based upon the writings of Aristotle) that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> charge interest for money because money itself is barren. He said that the walls and the roof of a house are barren, too, but it is permissible to charge someone for allowing him to use them. In the same way, money can be made fruitful.|$|E

25|$|David Miller {{has criticized}} {{this kind of}} {{criticism}} by Salmon and others because it makes inductivist assumptions. Popper does not say that corroboration is an indicator of predictive power. The predictive power is in the theory itself, not in its corroboration. The rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory {{is that it is}} simply easier to falsify: Well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment (already conducted at least once) could have falsified (but did not actually falsify) the one theory, while the same kind of experiment, regardless of its outcome, could not have falsified the other. So it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory: It may not be more likely to be true, but if it is actually false, it is easier to get rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up. Accordingly, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> consider corroboration as a reason, a justification for believing in a theory or as an argument in favor of a theory to convince someone who objects to it.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{something}} that is somewhat unusual in Japanese custody arrangements is the system of koseki, which legally defines households and persons' legal identity in Japanese law. When a non-Japanese marries a Japanese, the foreign spouse's name is recorded into Japanese spouse's koseki upon filing of the marriage, but the spouse's entry is not created in the koseki {{because of lack of}} Japanese citizenship. When their child is born, because the child has Japanese citizenship, an entry is created for the child in the Japanese spouse's koseki. There is a widespread misunderstanding that when a divorce occurs, the foreign spouse is removed from the koseki and the children's custody is automatically kept by the Japanese spouse who hold the koseki. Koseki and custody are not related. The confusion is increased by the fact that completely uncontested divorces are performed not by a court, but by the spouses simply filling out a family registry form at the city hall. When a divorce is finalized at the city hall, the name of the custodial parent of each child must be written in the filing. The name of the custodial parent is then recorded in each child's entry in the koseki. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> assume that unless custody is litigated in Japan, the Japanese parent will automatically hold custody of children in Japan, irrespective of the ruling of the foreign court. A divorce is not finalized in Japan unless custody is agreed to by the spouses or determined by the Japanese court. Furthermore, it is also wrong, but common, to assume that if the custodial parent dies, custody of the child is transferred within the koseki, which would mean that custody would be retained by the dead spouse's new married partner or Japanese grandparents who retain their custody as primary caregiver and would not be transferred to the surviving parent. When a sole custodial parent dies, the family court starts the procedure of appointing a guardian unless one has been designated in the will of the custodial parent.|$|E

500|$|Coursing {{has long}} sparked {{opposition}} from activists concerned about animal welfare. In 1892, Lady Florence Dixie criticised hare coursing as an [...] "aggravated form of torture" [...] and the League Against Cruel Sports {{was established in}} 1924 to campaign against rabbit coursing on Morden Common and continues to believe that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> expose animals {{to the risk of}} injury or death for human entertainment. The Waterloo Cup became a centrepiece of the campaign against coursing in the UK. In opposition, coursing has long enjoyed the fame of being known as [...] "the noblest of field sports" [...] precisely because the death of the hare is not the aim of the sport. Under most regulated forms of coursing only two hounds pursue the hare, the dogs competing against each other for a short time, and allowing the hare a significant chance of escape.|$|E
500|$|Halfway {{through the}} school year, Ali's family moves to the more {{peaceful}} Kurdish region in Northern Iraq but after living there for several months, Ali {{says that he is}} homesick and misses the action and noise of Baghdad. Mohammad, feeling lonely, [...] "adopts" [...] a bird with a broken wing and a mouse he finds in the house. This brings him some comfort, but his mother later demands that he get rid of the mouse as she does not want [...] "vermin" [...] in the house. Mohammad's family rejoice when Saddam Hussein is sentenced, and feel that his later execution was justified, as to do otherwise would have made the Iraqi people look weak. Conversely, Anmar's family is upset at his execution, as they feel that the people who came into power were no better than Hussein was. Hyder's mother says that many Iraqi people were hopeful about the arrival of American forces, and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> blame America for all of the problems in Iraq. She notes that the bloodshed has yet to stop as the Sunni continues to kill the Shiite, and vice versa. As the film continues, Hyder's family loses its income and they start to sell their furniture to earn extra money.|$|E
500|$|The Welsh Secretary, Peter Hain, who had {{appealed to}} the BBC Trust to have Griffin's {{appearance}} prevented, continued to denounce the decision. David Lammy, one of Britain's first black ministers, feared that people would face violence {{as a result of}} the programme. The former Home Secretary, David Blunkett, attacked the way in which BBC News at Six engaged in [...] "deliberate promotion of their own publicity-seeking decision", opining that [...] "the only people who have benefited from this row are the BNP and the BBC's Question Time ratings". The Conservative Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, responded to Griffin's complaints about the location by defending London's diversity, urging residents to [...] "reject their narrow, extremist and offensive views at every opportunity". Anshel Pfeffer, commenting for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, noted the relative silence of UK Jewish groups over the BNP appearance, and praised the BBC's decision to give the BNP a voice, stating: [...] "The BBC is right to have Griffin and other racists on its most respectable shows; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> apologise. By doing so it is simply fulfilling its democratic and journalistic duties." [...] Pfeffer compared and contrasted this with Israeli freedom-of-speech laws, and questioned whether Hitler could have risen to power in modern times given the media's scrutiny of democratic politicians.|$|E

2500|$|Now there's a {{weird thing}} going on. Partly {{proposed}} by {{a colleague of}} mine writing in The Nation, Christopher Hitchens.

2500|$|To such statements, Protestants such as Jordan {{point out}} that Christians will, in fact, choose against the blessing of money and great wealth. Jordan also {{maintains}} that, while children are indeed blessings, they are only one among {{a wide range of}} blessings God offers, and prayerfully choosing foci among them is part of prudent Christian stewardship. John Piper's Desiring God ministry further explains,Scriptures also say that a wife is a gift from the Lord (Proverbs 18:22), but that doesn't mean that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> stay single (1 Corinthians 7:8). Just because something is a gift from the Lord does not mean that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> be a steward of when or whether you will come into possession of it. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> reason that since A is good and a gift from the Lord, then we must pursue as much of A as possible. God has made this a world in which tradeoffs have to be made and we cannot do everything to the fullest extent. For kingdom purposes, it might be wise not to get married. And for kingdom purposes, it might be wise to regulate the size of one's family and to regulate when the new additions to the family will likely arrive.
