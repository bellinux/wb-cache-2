40|$|In social {{sciences}} {{it is easy}} to carry out sensory experiments using say a J-point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale.</b> One major problem with the J-point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale</b> is that a conversion from the category scales to numeric scores might not be sensible because the panelists generally view increments on the <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale</b> as psychologically unequal. In the current problem several products are rated by a set of panelists on the J-point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale.</b> One objective is to select the best subset of products and to assess the quality of the products by estimating the mean and standard deviation response for the selected products. A priori information about which subset is the best is incorporated, and a stochastic ordering is modified to select the best subset of the products. The method introduced in this article is sampling based, and it uses Monte Carlo integration with rejection sampling. The methodology is applied to select the best set of entrees in a military ration, and then to estimate the probability of at least a neutral response for the judged best entrees. A comparison is made with the method, which converts the category scales to numeric scores...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 To {{satisfy the}} desires of {{consumers}} in global markets for new products, {{it is essential that}} the cross-cultural differences in product acceptance are understood. An important aspect in cross-cultural research is the measurement tool of product acceptance. The most common scale for acceptance testing is the 9 -point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale</b> that was developed and evaluated in the United States (US) with American consumers. However, no research has been reported in the literature evaluating the effectiveness of the 9 -point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale</b> for Pacific Rim cultures. The first objective of this research was to compare the usage of the 9 -point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale</b> among American, Korean, Chinese, and Thai consumers. A total of 575 respondents evaluated sample pairs using 9 -point hedonic scales translated directly from English into their respective languages. Results indicate that Chinese, Korean, and Thai respondents use the 9 -point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale</b> differently from American respondents, irrespective of residency in the US or length of stay. These ethnic groups use a smaller range of the 9 -point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale</b> than Americans. Moreover, {{there were no significant differences}} in food preferences for Thai and Korea consumers residing in the US or their native countries. The implication of this research is that scaling effects may have confounded other cross-cultural studies comparing western and Pacific Rim cultures. A second study was conducted using 554 respondents from China, Taiwan, Korea and Thailand to further evaluate the effectiveness of modified hedonic scales for different Asian Pacific Rim cultures. This study had its objective to develop an improved <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale</b> for consumers from Korea, China, and Thailand. An incomplete Latin square design was employed to balance the presentation of sample pairs over four scale types. Results indicated Chinese respondents use an unstructured line scale with new word anchors most effectively, whereas Korean and Thai respondents use more effectively a structured 17 -point line scale. Results also show trends for cultural adaptations with length of residency for more effective use of the standard 9 -point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale</b> among Chinese from Taiwan, Koreans and Thais. These results can be applied for more effective cross-cultural research when comparing food acceptance among American, Chinese, Korean, and Thai consumers. Further, these results suggest that caution must be taken when using Korean, Chinese, and Thai consumers residing in the US as predictors of consumer acceptance in their native countries...|$|E

40|$|Psychological biases in {{consumer}} testing {{may lead to}} misinterpretation of results and lower experimental power. Reports on various <b>hedonic</b> <b>scales</b> associated with psychological biases induced by sample presentation are limited in the literature. An appropriate experimental protocol could enable sensory scientists to accurately determine if a product {{is more or less}} liked. Overall, in this study some drawbacks of <b>hedonic</b> <b>scales</b> were revealed and some recommendations were made under specific circumstances. A more powerful design (SPRCBD) helped minimize positional and First Serving Order (FSO) biases {{in consumer}} tests by extracting more explained variances, resulting in decreased Type-II error in the model. Logistic regression analysis was proven to be an alternative methodology to quantify sensory contrast effects. For sensory testing, a multidimensional attribute tended to be more affected by the contrast effects than a simpler attribute. Several scales have been used for assessing the degree of food liking/disliking. This study provided a good practice protocol, suggesting use of a regular scale length (100 mm.) for assessing a degree of food liking/disliking while Labeled Affective Magnitude (LAM) would be an alternative choice where the scale length effects may be a critical issue. Depending on the type of scale and its polarity, a negative attribute (e. g., bitterness) was more affected than was a positive attribute. When testing extremely liked product, one should be aware of contrast biases that affected more toward positive attributes than negative attributes. This study demonstrated some psychological biases that affected the hedonic ratings. There are many more factors that could sway sensory responses and prevent experimenters from getting accurate, valid and actionable outcome. Understanding of psychological biases, proper product selection, and proper data analysis should be further studied to minimize misinterpretation of hedonic ratings...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} with the objective to standardise procedures for preparation of semolina (rava) from sorghum, to identify the best genotype for preparation of semolina and to study the nutritional quality parameters of semolina. For processing of sorghum, ten varieties and five hybrids were used for preparation of semolina and their products. A process has been standardized for semolina preparation using ultra grinding mill from sorghum grain. The semolina yield ranged from 46. 51 % to 54. 29 %. Hybrid CSH- 15 R gave the highest yield of semolina (54. 29 %). Starch content in semolina ranged from 59. 93 % to 66. 43 %. The new genotypes Phule Vasudha, Phule Yashoda and M 35 - 1 showed higher levels of starch content {{as compared to the}} other genotypes. The Phule Vasudha and Selection- 3 showed higher levels of total soluble sugars in grains, as well as in semolina than the other genotypes. Phule Maulee gave higher level of crude fibre content (3. 12 %). The amino acid profile of sorghum grain and semolina showed very minor differences in the content due to the processing of sorghum grains into various products like semolina. The new genotypes of rabi sorghum showed comparable results for the mineral with that of hybrids. The organoleptic properties of the sweet (shira), upama and idali prepared from semolina were judged on the basis of colour, texture and appearance, flavour, taste and overall acceptability of the products using semi-trained judges and 1 to 9 <b>hedonic</b> <b>scales.</b> All products prepared from semolina were like very much and gave highest rating of more than 8 <b>hedonic</b> <b>scales.</b> While considering the yield of semolina from sorghum grains as well as their nutritional composition and organoleptic properties of the niche products (shira, upama, idali) prepared from them, the varieties Phule Vasudha and Phule Yashoda were the best one as compared to the other varieties and hybrids and overall varieties were better than the hybrids...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a semantically labeled <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale</b> (LHS) that would yield ratio-level data on the magnitude of liking/disliking of sensation equivalent to that produced by magnitude estimation (ME). The LHS was constructed by having 49 subjects who were trained in ME rate the semantic magnitudes of 10 common hedonic descriptors within a broad context of imagined hedonic experiences that included tastes and flavors. The resulting bipolar scale is statistically symmetrical around neutral and has a unique semantic structure. The LHS was evaluated quantitatively by comparing it with ME and the 9 -point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale.</b> The LHS yielded nearly identical ratings to those obtained using ME, which implies that its semantic labels are valid and that it produces ratio-level data equivalent to ME. Analyses of variance conducted on the hedonic ratings from the LHS and the 9 -point scale gave similar results, but the LHS showed much greater resistance to ceiling effects and yielded normally distributed data, whereas the 9 -point scale did not. These results indicate that the LHS has significant semantic, quantitative, and statistical advantages over the 9 -point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale...</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{alternative}} rating method, {{known as}} positional relative rating (PRR), or rank rating, was {{compared with the}} traditional 9 -point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale.</b> Initially, category scale and line scale versions of PRR were investigated to see which of either was better at differentiating samples. Four lemonades were assessed in duplicate on both scales (category and line). Overall quality, sweetness intensity and sourness intensity were assessed in separate sessions by groups of ~ 50 consumers, depending on session. The category scale better differentiated samples than did the line scale for two of three attributes assessed, with differentiation being {{the same in the}} third. Subsequently, the overall liking of these same lemonades was assessed by 100 consumers on both the PRR category scale and the traditional 9 -point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale.</b> The differentiation of samples for both scales was equivalent, although mean values were somewhat lower with PRR. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS This work explores an alternative to the traditional 9 -point scale. Posi-tional relative rating (PRR) performs as well as the traditional 9 -point scale in differentiating samples, suggesting that it is a viable alternative. However, as PRR seems to give consistently lower mean values than does the traditional 9 -point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale,</b> those using a âhurdle â approach to screen products may wish to lower that hurdle when PRR is used.

The current study was aimed to confirm that the LHS can produce ratiolevel data in a product development setting, where samples only differ slightly, by comparing it with magnitude estimation (ME), which yields ratio-level data. Subjects (N= 40, 12 M, 28 F, Age range: 19 - 32) attended two separate testing sessions. During each session, they used one of the two scaling methods (i. e., LHS, ME) to rate their liking and disliking of two product systems (cherry flavored Kool-Aid and vanilla custard) with varying sucrose concentrations (0. 14, 0. 20, 0. 28, 0. 40, 0. 56 M). The results indicated that the LHS yielded data that were not significantly different to that obtained using ME for both product systems (repeated measures ANOVA, p> 0. 05), implying that the LHS, in fact, produced ratio-level data. The results also indicated that the LHS offered slightly better discrimination power than ME.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how a broad-based information session would affect consumersâ perceptions and attitudes about an edible insect product. Design: During a taste testing session, preceded or followed by an information session about entomophagy, participants rated the organoleptic characteristics of two bread samples on 9 -point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scales.</b> The two bread samples were identical, though one was faux-labelled as containing an insect product. Findings: General Linear Model (GLM) analysis showed effects of gender, information session exposure, entomophagy familiarity, and entomophagy experience on participantsâ ratings of the samples. WilcoxonâMann-Whitney ranked sum tests showed that appearance, flavour, and overall liking were significantly better rated for the bread sample labelled as insect-free by participants who attended the presentation a priori. Potential ways to improve information content and delivery in favour of encouraging dietary shifts are discussed.

The results provide clues regarding how the food industry can adapt communication for target audiences. Originality: Actual edible insect products were not used in this study. Paradoxically, it is the first to show the impact of an information session on the acceptability of edible insect products, by revealing participantsâ perceptual expectations. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} produce jellies with the {{collagen}} extracted from chicken feet. Jelly samples were prepared with flavors of pineapple (GAB) and white chocolate (GCB). Using a <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale,</b> 30 untrained tasters evaluated sensory acceptance {{and willingness to}} consume the jellies. Results showed that GCB and GAB samples, respectively, scored 7. 8 and 7. 4 in the <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale</b> for all sensory attributes; indicating that both products had good acceptance. In relation to the willingness to consume the GCB and GAB samples, 85 and 74 % of consumers, respectively, declared that they would consume once a week. Este trabalho objetivou a produÃ§Ã£o de geleias a partir do colÃ¡geno extraÃ­do dos tarsos de frango. Prepararam-se amostras com sabor de abacaxi (GAB) e chocolate branco (GCB). Trinta provadores nÃ£o-treinados avaliaram, em escala hedÃ´nica, a aceitaÃ§Ã£o sensorial e a disponibilidade em se consumir as geleias. Os resultados mostraram que as amostras GCB e GAB obtiveram uma mÃ©dia, respectivamente, de 7, 8 e 7, 4 em escala hedÃ´nica, para todos os atributos; indicando que ambos os produtos foram bem aceitos. Quanto ao consumo das amostras GCB e GAB, 85 e 74 % dos provadores, respectivamente, indicou que consumiriam uma vez por semana...|$|E
30|$|The sensory {{analysis}} herein {{was consistent with}} previous mussel studies (Kryzynowek and Wiggin 1979; Ablett et al. 1986; GÃ¶koglu 2002). The panelists were able to determine the mussel product qualitative characteristics on appearance, odor, flavor, texture, and global perception. Both types of mussel (open ocean and commercial) reached scores of 7 over 9 points at <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale</b> for all sensory attributes. In general terms, even though no triangle test was done, the {{sensory analysis}} session was performed stably and consistently among panelists.|$|E
30|$|The sensory {{evaluation}} of the products was carried for various attributes namely colour and appearance, flavour, juiciness, texture and overall acceptability {{by a panel of}} seven experienced panellists on a 8 -point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scale,</b> wherein 8 denoted âextremely desirableâ and 1 denoted âextremely undesirableâ (Seman et al., 1987). Panellists were seated in a room free of noise and odours and suitably illuminated. Coded samples for {{sensory evaluation}} were prepared and served warm to panellists. Water was provided for oral rinsing between the samples.|$|E
40|$|Agriculture-based {{reformulation}} initiatives, including oleic acid-rich lipid supplementation of {{the dairy}} cow diet, provide a novel means for reducing intake of {{saturated fatty acids}} (SFA) at a population level. In a blinded manner, this study evaluated the consumer acceptance of SFA-reduced, monounsaturated fatty acid-enriched (modified) milk, Cheddar cheese, and butter when compared with control and commercially available comparative samples. The effect of providing nutritional information about the modified cheese was also evaluated. Consumers (n = 115) rated samples for overall liking (appearance, flavor, and texture) using 9 -point <b>hedonic</b> <b>scales.</b> Although {{no significant differences were}} found between the milk samples, the modified cheese was liked significantly less than a regular-fat commercial alternative for overall liking and liking of specific modalities and had a lower liking of texture score compared with the control cheese. The provision of health information significantly increased the overall liking of the modified cheese compared with tasting the same sample in a blinded manner. Significant differences were evident between the butter samples for overall liking and modalities of liking; all of the samples were significantly more liked than the commercial butter and sunflower oil spread. In conclusion, this study illustrated that consumer acceptance of SFA-reduced, monounsaturated fatty acid-enriched dairy products was dependent on product type. Future research should consider how optimization of the textural properties of fatty acid-modified (and fat-reduced) cheese might enhance consumer acceptance of this product...|$|R
40|$|An end-anchored 9 -point hedonic product liking (PL) {{scale is}} an easy-to-apply {{instrument}} to examine consumers' PL. Because 9 -point <b>hedonic</b> PL <b>scales</b> {{are also popular}} in cross-national research, strong demands are put on its cross-national equivalence, that is, the absence of cross-national scoring bias. The present study provides a procedure to identify the presence of cross-national scoring bias {{in the use of}} the end-anchored 9 -point <b>hedonic</b> PL <b>scale</b> or any other rating scale to measure PL. The procedure is illustrated on experimental (illustrative) data from students in four European nations (i. e., Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain). It explores cross-national equivalence in terms of (1) mean PL scores, (2) variation in PL scores, and (3) the impact of cross-cultural scoring bias in statistical inference making. Data analyses revealed that cross-national scoring bias only affected the variability in participants' PL scores, but not the level of their PL scores. However, cross-national scoring bias in variation in PL scores did exert a substantial influence on a statistical inference making of mean PL scores. In sum, this study (1) provides preliminary evidence that cross-national scoring bias may seriously hamper the validity of cross-national comparisons of PL scores; and (2) offers a new methodology allowing food researchers to assess the extent to which the amount of cross-national scoring bias in their PL data will result in invalid cross-national comparisons...|$|R
40|$|In Portugal {{a popular}} desert is whey cheese with pumpkin jam. However, these two {{products}} are only sold separately. Having {{in mind that}} the production of a combination of these two would be potentially interesting for new food commercializing, studies were conducted on the development of this new food product. A sensorial evaluation and a consumer study were conducted to perceive how consumers accepted this new product. The sensorial evaluation consisted of a descriptive analysis, with a panel of 17 tasters. The parameters evaluated using five points <b>hedonic</b> <b>scales</b> were: homogeneity in colour, homogeneity of the product, milk aroma, intensity of aroma, intensity of taste, salty taste, milk taste, sweetness, consistency and presence of granules. The results of the classification given to the different parameters evaluated in the sensorial analysis showed that only the salty taste received a classification of 2 (in a scale of 1 to 4), whereas all the others had 4 or 5, indicating that the panellists appreciated the product. Regarding the consumer study, this was performed by applying questionnaires to 100 persons. The results showed that almost 60 % of the enquired referred liking whey cheese with pumpkin jam. As to the frequency of consumption, the majority does it monthly, but there is still a good deal of people who do it daily. From the results obtained, it can be inferred that this product can be a successful innovation in the Portuguese dairy industry...|$|R
