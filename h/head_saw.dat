25|$|Double cut saws have {{cutting teeth}} on both sides. They are {{generally}} very large, similar {{in size to}} a <b>head</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|E
25|$|By the 1900s {{the company}} had {{challenges}} making ends meet. The company therefore in 1905 initiated a program to totally revamp its operations. The three <b>head</b> <b>saw</b> mills were demolished and replaced with a new, steam-powered <b>head</b> <b>saw</b> mill adjacent to the edger mill. The pulp mill was expanded to handle 15,000 tones annually, powered by the new Tistedalsfossen Power Station. Finally a new chemical pulp mill was to be built at Kaken. A complicating factor for the power station was that the company only owned {{about two-thirds of the}} waterfall rights. Finally the Tista Canal was built, allowing direct access from Kaken to the port.|$|E
25|$|The <b>head</b> <b>saw</b> mill {{was closed}} in 1931, but the edger mill was kept and refined coarse-cut wood from other mills in the area. Viscose became {{gradually}} more important; it {{was responsible for}} 30 percent of production in 1930 and 57 percent in 1937. Newsprint production was cut out and the remaining production move to finer grades of paper. The company also established production facilities for wood engraving and pressure treating. The 1930s were generally good times for the company, with a steady increase in prices. Then the bottom fell out the market in 1938, resulting in NOK2 million in losses.|$|E
5000|$|All these Connecticut {{roads are}} {{connected}} to legends of Melon <b>Heads,</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill and Velvet are commonly referred to by residents as [...] "Dracula Drive".|$|R
50|$|Dependent {{upon the}} log diameter, <b>head</b> <b>saws</b> can cut a log at speeds ranging from 1 to 300 feet per minute. Generally, log {{carriage}} speeds are adjustable for optimal performance.|$|R
50|$|Sawmills {{first used}} smaller {{diameter}} circular saws to resaw dimension lumber such as lath and wall studs and for edging boards. As the technology advanced large diameter saw blades {{began to be}} used for the <b>head</b> <b>saws</b> and to cut clapboards.|$|R
25|$|Cash {{was very}} close to his older brother, Jack. In May 1944, Jack was pulled into a {{whirling}} <b>head</b> <b>saw</b> in the mill where he worked and was almost cut in two. He suffered {{for more than a week}} before dying on May 20, 1944, at the age of 15. Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident. According to Cash: The Autobiography, his father was away that morning, but Johnny and his mother, and Jack himself, all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day. His mother urged Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother. Jack insisted on working since the family needed the money. On his deathbed, Jack said he had visions of Heaven and angels. Decades later, Cash spoke of looking forward to meeting his brother in Heaven.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Franklin's clear <b>head</b> <b>saw</b> {{the turn}} the Sergeant's suspicions had taken, in the {{twinkling}} of an eye.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} then slightly {{turned his}} <b>head,</b> <b>saw</b> Owen, and recognized him. Owen passed out without recognizing {{the other as}} Manston.|$|E
50|$|Today, <b>head</b> <b>saws</b> {{are mostly}} used for cutting logs 16 to 72 inches in {{diameter}} depending upon the type of band mill the saws are mounted on. More optimized machines now cut the smaller diameters since they are far more efficient and can provide greater production.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Head</b> <b>saws</b> {{are large}} {{bandsaws}} {{that make the}} initial cuts in a log. [...] They generally have a [...] tooth space {{on the cutting edge}} and sliver teeth on the back. [...] Sliver teeth are non-cutting teeth designed to wipe slivers out of the way when the blade needs to back out of a cut.|$|R
5000|$|Pins {{that will}} no longer stand on their bases have their <b>heads</b> <b>sawed</b> off down to become rimfire targets for the [...]22 match, where the [...] "pin tops" [...] are engaged by the shooter. Given the very light weight of the [...] "pin top," [...] the [...]22 is quite capable of {{removing}} the target from {{the table with a}} single well-placed shot.|$|R
6000|$|When the physician's <b>head</b> <b>saw</b> {{that the}} poison had taken effect, {{and that the}} king {{had only a few}} more minutes to live, [...] "Tyrant," [...] it cried, [...] "see how cruelty and {{injustice}} are punished." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned slowly}} {{and went down}} the road meditating. He heard the cottage door re-open, and turning his <b>head,</b> <b>saw</b> through {{intervening}} scarlet runners Mrs Gustick with a steaming saucepan full of boiling cabbage water in her hand.|$|E
6000|$|No answer. Hester {{repeated}} her words, but Sir Richard never stirred. Much alarmed, {{the woman}} raised his <b>head,</b> <b>saw</b> {{that he was}} unconscious, and rang for help. But Richard Trevlyn was past help, though he lingered for some hours. He spoke but once, murmuring faintly, [...] "Will Alice come to say good-bye?" ...|$|E
60|$|Ossipon, {{stretching}} his <b>head</b> forward, <b>saw</b> a faint {{gleam in}} the darkness of the shop.|$|R
50|$|Then Earthmaker (Mą'ųna) {{sent down}} another son, He who Wears Human Heads as Earrings. He went around talking to people, {{but they would}} always fix on his {{earrings}} which were actual, living, miniature human heads. When these little <b>heads</b> <b>saw</b> someone looking at them, they would wink and make funny faces. In the end, He who Wears Human Heads as Earrings could not accomplish the mission either.|$|R
60|$|The answer {{appeared}} to satisfy Sinan, who fixed his eyes upon the pale beauty of Rosamund and asked no more questions. While he remained thus thinking, a noise arose {{at the end}} of the terrace, and the brethren, turning their <b>heads,</b> <b>saw</b> that the thick-set knight was striving to thrust his way through the guards who stood by the curtains and barred his path with the shafts of their spears.|$|R
6000|$|She {{turned her}} <b>head,</b> <b>saw</b> him, {{and took up}} her clothes-basket to {{continue}} the ascent. The steepness was such that to climb it unencumbered was a breathless business; the linen made her task a cruelty to her. 'You'll never get to the forts with that weight,' he said. 'Give it to me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get {{away with}} you--go!" [...] said Tulliver, angrily. But {{it was not}} to Wakem that he spoke. Slowly the lawyer rose, and, as he turned his <b>head,</b> <b>saw</b> that Tulliver's arms were being held by a girl, rather by the fear of hurting the girl that clung to him with all her young might.|$|E
60|$|Then the Angel heard a {{shuffling}} of {{feet and}} the gride of wheels behind him, and turning his <b>head</b> <b>saw</b> a man dressed in dirty brown rags and a felt hat grey with dust, who was standing with a slight swaying motion and fixedly regarding the Angelic back. Beyond him was another almost equally dirty, pushing a knife grinder's barrow over the bridge.|$|E
60|$|Flamelight was {{flickering}} in the candled dusk. Lawford {{turned his}} <b>head</b> and <b>saw</b> Sheila's coiled, beautiful {{hair in the}} firelight.|$|R
60|$|Her colour {{came and}} went once more; and once more, as she bent her <b>head,</b> I <b>saw</b> the same sad smile.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bob, wake; 'tis {{your own}} Anne!' she said, with {{innocent}} earnestness; and then, fearfully turning her <b>head,</b> she <b>saw</b> that Matilda was close behind her.|$|R
60|$|Practically simultaneously, I saw the out-rush {{of smoke}} and heard the report. I heard a grunt from Henry, and, turning my <b>head,</b> <b>saw</b> him cling to the spokes and turn the wheel half a {{revolution}} as he sank to the deck. It {{must have been a}} lucky shot. The boy was perforated through the heart or very near to the heart--we have no time for post-mortems on the Elsinore.|$|E
60|$|Setting spurs to Covenant I rode {{over to our}} companions and {{delivered}} the message. Sir Stephen, who had been struck by a petronel bullet, and wore a crimsoned kerchief bound round his snow-white <b>head,</b> <b>saw</b> {{the wisdom of the}} advice, and moved his townsmen as directed. His musqueteers being better provided with powder than ours did good service by keeping down for a time the deadly fire from across the fosse.|$|E
60|$|In {{the meadows}} wandered {{black and white}} cattle fantastically marked. One beast, with a white head {{and the rest of}} the body glossy black, came to the edge to drink, and stood gravely {{twitching}} his ears at me as I went by, like some sort of preposterous clergyman in a play. A moment after I heard a loud plunge, and, turning my <b>head,</b> <b>saw</b> the clergyman struggling to shore. The bank had given way under his feet.|$|E
60|$|She {{uncovered}} her <b>head</b> and <b>saw</b> her godfather's confessor {{standing by}} her, {{in a room}} where there were other grave men talking in subdued tones.|$|R
60|$|It was Tito Melema {{who felt}} that clutch. He turned his <b>head,</b> and <b>saw</b> {{the face of his}} adoptive father, Baldassarre Calvo, close to his own.|$|R
6000|$|When Miriam {{turned her}} <b>head</b> and <b>saw</b> the black eyes of Miss Panney gazing down upon her, she pushed herself {{back in the}} bed, and exclaimed,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Graham {{felt for}} the ladder with {{extended}} hands, put {{his foot on the}} lower rung, and, turning his <b>head,</b> <b>saw</b> over the shoulder of the nearest man, in the yellow flicker of the light, the first-comer astride over Howard and still working at the door. Graham turned to the ladder again, and was thrust by his conductor and helped up by those above, and then he was standing on something hard and cold and slippery outside the ventilating funnel.|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} instant {{the head of a}} huge tusker poked through the trees that fringed the clearing. The Hon. Morison and Meriem, with eyes and ears for one another alone, did not see or hear; but Numa did. The man upon Tantor's broad <b>head</b> <b>saw</b> the girl in the man's arms. It was Korak; but in the trim figure of the neatly garbed girl he did not {{recognize}} his Meriem. He only saw a Tarmangani with his she. And then Numa charged.|$|E
60|$|Cliffe came in {{and greeted}} Grahame cordially; and Grahame, glancing down the table without turning his <b>head,</b> <b>saw</b> the Cuban {{studying}} them. Something in the man's manner suggested that Cliffe's friendliness had surprised him. He made a few hasty pencil marks {{on the back of}} an old letter and then, looking up suddenly, caught Grahame watching him curiously. The Cuban pushed back his chair and left the room, although Grahame suspected that his dinner was not more than half finished.|$|E
50|$|On the Same day Mati Das, {{elder brother}} of Sati Das, {{was made to}} stand erect between two posts and double <b>headed</b> <b>saw</b> was placed {{on his head and}} moved across from head to the loins. Seeing this Dyal Das abused the Emperor and his courtiers for this infernal act. He was tied up like a round bundle and thrown into a huge {{cauldron}} of boiling oil. He was roasted alive into a block of charcoal. The Guru witnessed all this savagery with divine calm.|$|R
50|$|The length, gauge {{and number}} of drive links is punched {{on the side of}} the saw bar. This {{information}} can be found near the <b>saw</b> <b>head.</b> Since the <b>saw</b> bar should be turned 180 degrees between sharpenings, the punched information can be towards the <b>saw</b> power <b>head</b> or outside.|$|R
2500|$|Wrangler was {{approached}} {{to appear in}} gay pornographic films by Magnum Studios, the pioneering gay adult film studio and magazine publisher, after studio <b>heads</b> <b>saw</b> a poster for Special Friends featuring him semi-nude. His first gay porn film was 1970's Eyes of a Stranger (also known as Eyes of a Gay Stranger; Magnum Studios), {{one of the first}} hard-core gay adult films to be released commercially in the United States. [...] Wrangler performed in gay pornographic films for several reasons. [...] First he saw them as culturally subversive and politically liberating: ...|$|R
