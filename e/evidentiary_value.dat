500|$|Dionysius {{is quoted}} saying that Valerian was so {{friendly}} to Christians that he outdid [...] "those who {{were said to}} be openly Christians" [...] (οἰ λεχθέντες ἀναφανδὸν Χριοτιανοὶ γεγονέναι, tr. Shahîd). Most scholars, Shahîd and Stein included, understand this as a reference to Severus Alexander and Philip. Because the reference is to a plurality of emperors, implying that Severus Alexander and Philip were both Christians, Stein dismissed the passage as entirely without <b>evidentiary</b> <b>value.</b> Shahîd, however, contends that genuine information can be extracted from the spurious whole, and that, while the reference to Severus Alexander is hyperbole, the reference to Philip is not. He explains the reference to Severus Alexander as a Christian as an exaggeration of what was actually only an interest in the Christian religion. Shahîd references a passage in the often-dubious Historia Augustas biography of the emperor, which states that Alexander had statues of Abraham, Christ, and Orpheus in his private chapel, and that he prayed to them each morning. He also adduces the letters sent from Origen to Alexander's mother Mamaea (Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica 6.21, 6.28) to explain Dionysius' comment.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the {{necessity}} for ADSL router forensics has been minimal as the device {{had yet to be}} targeted by Internet based threats. As the number and sophistication of these threats increases, the need for forensic acquisition methods is in-turn increasing. Whilst the specialisation of digital forensics has evolved significantly over the years, the field of ADSL router forensics is a new and developing field. In-turn the information and analysis presented in this paper is based on research in progress. The paper begins by detailing some of the potential threats that may target ADSL routers. It continues by describing items of <b>evidentiary</b> <b>values</b> for the purpose of the research. An overview is provided of existing research on network forensics and how it may impact the ADSL router investigation. It then details high and low level methods of data acquisition which would permit evidence to be admissible in the court of law.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to perform {{association}} analysis of UASMS 1 polymor-phism in leptin gene with parameters of beef quality, studied {{on a group of}} Czech Fleckvieh bulls. The group of 236 bulls was genotyped by direct sequencing of the PCR product. Individual genotypes were processed into a database and statistical evaluation of association was performed by using SAS software. The UASMS 1 polymorphism had a highly significant effect on palmitoleic acid content (p = 0. 00006) and stearic acid content (p = 0. 0005) between CT and TT genotypes. There was a significant value in myristoleic acid content (p = 0. 0117) between genotypes CT and TT and in linolelaidic acid content between both genotypes CC and CT (p = 0. 0340) and CC and TT (p = 0. 0417). Values relating to the effect on dry matter content (p = 0. 0746) and colour of meat (p = 0. 0541) had only approaching <b>evidentiary</b> <b>values.</b> The influence of genotype on intramuscular fat content or other parameters of beef quality has not been demon-strated in this study...|$|R

It also includes equality for persons with disabilities who {{have the same rights}} and obligations with normal people. This equality is intended for all aspects of life including equal before the law without discrimination, to receive protection and equal benefit of the law but the presence of persons with disabilities is not currently fully recognized. this is evident from the lack of fulfillment of the rights, protection and even discrimination. In the field of law, witnesses with disabilities are ignored because they are not capable of law and not in the category of full testimony, which is able to see, hear and experience. Proving criminal offenses involving persons with disabilities is hampered themselves and other with disabilities. Obstacles faced in handling criminal cases involving persons with disabilities,among others, the view that the testimony of persons with disabilities do not have the force of law, the existence of communication problems with disabilities, especially deaf persons who require a sign language interpreter to express his statement as a witness. In the provisionof sign language interpreters are also experiencing problems. To the research conducted by reviewing the laws relating to the strength of the testimony of witness evidence deaf persons in criminal justice process to determine whether the statements of witnesses with a deaf have the same <b>evidentiary</b> strength <b>values</b> with anormal witness testimony and to know the dinamics of the examination of the witness deaf in criminal proceedings. the results of this research is that the witness testimony of deaf have the same strength of evidence that there are normal people because equality principle and the deaf sworn witness testimony that also strengthens.

40|$|Purpose Health {{technology}} assessment (HTA) coverage recommendations differ across countries {{for the same}} drugs. Unlike previous studies, this study adopts a mixed methods research design to investigate, in a systematic manner, these differences. Methods HTA recommendations for ten orphan drugs appraised in England (NICE), Scotland (SMC), Sweden (TLV) and France (HAS) (N = 35) were compared using a validated methodological framework that breaks down these complex decision processes into stages facilitating their understanding, analysis and comparison, namely: (1) the clinical/cost-effectiveness evidence, (2) its interpretation (e. g. part of the deliberative process) and (3) influence on the final decision. This allowed qualitative and quantitative identification of the criteria driving recommendations and highlighted cross-country differences. Results Six out of ten drugs received diverging HTA recommendations. Reasons for cross-country differences included heterogeneity in the evidence appraised, {{in the interpretation of}} the same evidence, and in the different ways of dealing with the same uncertainty. These may have been influenced by agency-specific <b>evidentiary,</b> risk and <b>value</b> preferences, or stakeholder input. “Other considerations” (e. g. severity, orphan status) and other decision modulators (e. g. patient access schemes, lower discount rates, restrictions, re-assessments) also rendered uncertainty and cost-effectiveness estimates more acceptable. The different HTA approaches (clinical versus cost-effectiveness) and ways identified of dealing with orphan drug particularities also had implications on the final decisions. Conclusions This research contributes to better understanding the drivers of these complex decisions and why countries make different decisions. It also contributed to identifying those factors beyond the standard clinical and cost-effectiveness tools used in HTA, and their role in shaping these decisions...|$|R

50|$|In France, {{notarial}} instruments, {{whether in}} public (en minute) or private form (en brevet), {{have a high}} degree of authority and are considered probative instruments (acte authentique), received as firsthand and primary evidence in court, and thereby accorded high <b>evidentiary</b> <b>value</b> and executory force, and deemed to be proof of their contents.

5000|$|In this decision, the Court {{compared}} and contrasted {{the various}} Burden of proof (law) against the [...] "benefit of the doubt" [...] rule. In criminal law, {{the burden of}} proof used is beyond a Reasonable doubt. Next in the spectrum would be Clear and convincing evidence, followed by the [...] "fair preponderance" [...] standard used in Civil litigation. Last in stringency order would be the [...] "reasonable doubt standard" [...] which is defined regulatorily as: It is the defined and consistently applied policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent, however, with the facts shown in every case. When, after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding service origin, the degree of disability, or any other point, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. By reasonable doubt is meant one which exists because of an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence which does not satisfactorily prove or disprove the claim. It is a substantial doubt and one within the range of probability as distinguished from pure speculation or remote possibility. It is not a means of reconciling actual conflict or a contradiction in the evidence. Mere suspicion or doubt as to the truth of any statements submitted, as distinguished from impeachment or contradiction by evidence or known facts, is not justifiable basis for denying the application of the reasonable doubt doctrine if the entire, complete record otherwise warrants invoking this doctrine. The reasonable doubt doctrine is also applicable {{even in the absence of}} official records, particularly if the basic incident allegedly arose under combat, or similarly strenuous conditions, and is consistent with the probable results of such known hardships. (Emphasis added)The Court, in explaining how this applies to the weighing of evidence in Veterans claims, used a rule used in Baseball sandlot folklore that the Tie goes to the runner. In other words, when the <b>evidentiary</b> <b>value</b> of the negative evidence against the Veteran's claim is the same as the <b>evidentiary</b> <b>value</b> of the positive evidence for the Veteran's claim, reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of the Veteran.|$|E
