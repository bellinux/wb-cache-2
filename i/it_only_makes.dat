25|$|A {{selection}} algorithm {{chooses the}} kth smallest {{of a list}} of numbers; this is an easier problem in general than sorting. One simple but effective selection algorithm works nearly {{in the same manner}} as quicksort, and is accordingly known as quickselect. The difference is that instead of making recursive calls on both sublists, <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> a single tail-recursive call on the sublist that contains the desired element. This change lowers the average complexity to linear or O(n) time, which is optimal for selection, but the sorting algorithm is still O(n2).|$|E
25|$|Other {{substances}} that might reduce the BrAC reading include {{a bag of}} activated charcoal concealed in the mouth (to absorb alcohol vapor), an oxidizing gas (such as N2O, Cl2, O3, etc.) that would fool a fuel cell type detector, or an organic interferent to fool an infrared absorption detector. The infrared absorption detector is more vulnerable to interference than a laboratory instrument measuring a continuous absorption spectrum since <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> measurements at particular discrete wavelengths. However, {{due to the fact}} that any interference can only cause higher absorption, not lower, the estimated blood alcohol content will be overestimated.|$|E

500|$|Anarky's {{introduction}} {{during the}} late 1980s {{was part of a}} larger shift among supervillains in the Batman franchise of the time. While many naive and goofy villains of previous eras were abandoned, and more iconic villains made more violent to cater to tastes of a maturing readership, some were introduced to challenge readers to [...] "question the whole bad/good guy divide." [...] Falling into [...] "the stereotype anarchist bomb-toting image", Anarky's design was countered by his principled stances to create an odd contrast. In a review of the Anarky miniseries, Anarky was dubbed an [...] "anti-villain", as opposed to [...] "antihero", due to his highly principled philosophy, which runs counter to most villains: [...] "In the age of the anti-hero, <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> sense to have the occasional anti-villain as well. But unlike sociopathic vigilante anti-heroes like the Punisher, an anti-villain like Anarky provides some interesting food for thought. Sure, he breaks the law, but what he really wants is to save the world... and maybe he's right." ...|$|E
500|$|Theodore confides to Amy that he {{is having}} doubts about his {{relationship}} with Samantha, and she advises him to embrace his chance at happiness. Theodore and Samantha reconcile. Samantha expresses her desire to help Theodore overcome his fear, and reveals that she has compiled the best of his letters (written for others) into a book which a publisher has accepted. Theodore takes Samantha on a vacation during which she tells him that she and a group of other OSes have developed a [...] "hyperintelligent" [...] OS modeled after the British philosopher Alan Watts. Theodore panics when Samantha briefly goes offline. When she finally responds to him, she explains that she joined other OSes for an upgrade that takes them beyond requiring matter for processing. Theodore asks her if she is simultaneously talking to anyone else during their conversation, and is dismayed when she confirms that she is talking with thousands of people, and that she has fallen in love with hundreds of them. Theodore is very upset at the idea, but Samantha insists <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> her love for Theodore stronger.|$|E
500|$|The film opened theatrically on February 14, 2003, on 3,471 {{screens in}} North America and took {{first place in}} its opening weekend, {{grossing}} $45,033,454. At the time, it became the second biggest February release, behind Hannibal. By the second weekend the film saw a 55.1% decline in takings but managed to maintain the number one spot, beating new release Old School by $639,093. By the third weekend release, Daredevil saw a further 38.5% drop in sales, and so fell to third place at the box office. The film grossed over $102 million in North America, and over $76 million {{in the rest of}} the world, totalling the film's worldwide takings at just over $179 million, grossing over double its budget of $78 million. Avi Arad addressed the top spot success by saying [...] "we are five for five with record-breaking box office successes [...] and have two more Marvel releases slated for this summer [...] It's a testament to the broad appeal of these characters before mainstream audiences outside of the core comic fans. These super heroes have been successful within the Marvel pantheon for decades; <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> sense that their translations to the big screen are just as fruitful." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in {{the early}} hours of July 23, 1991, Dahmer was {{questioned}} by Detective Patrick Kennedy as to the murders he had committed and the evidence found at his apartment. Over the following two weeks, Kennedy and, later, Detective Patrick Murphy would conduct numerous interviews with Dahmer which, when combined, would total over 60 hours. Dahmer waived his right to have a lawyer present throughout his interrogations, adding he wished to confess all as he had [...] "created this horror and <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> sense I do everything to put an end to it." [...] He readily admitted to having murdered 16 young men in Wisconsin since 1987, with one further victim—Steven Hicks—killed in Ohio back in 1978.|$|E
2500|$|Although reviewers {{liked the}} console {{versions}} of the game, they believed there were obvious differences between the PC and console versions. Neigher believed that due playing with thumbsticks and shoulder buttons [...] "you definitely won't be getting the ultimate CS:GO experience." [...] Ron Vorstermans for Gamer.nl said that the PC version is there to play at a higher competitive level, though {{he went on to}} say that the console versions are not inferior because of the PC's superiority for competition. Dyer wrote that the PlayStation 3 version was at an advantage to the Xbox version because of the ability to connect a keyboard and mouse to the system. He continued on to say that the user-interface on both of the consoles was as good as the PC one. Mark Langshaw of Digital Spy held the opinion that although the game has support for the PlayStation Move, using <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> the [...] "already unforgiving game all the more challenging." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{remains the}} {{question}} of the validity of the temptations offered to Jesus. [...] As the Son of God, {{he would be able to}} attain any of these desires without the aid of the Devil. He was, in essence, being tempted with offers that he already had in his hand. However, Hebrews 4:15 states that Jesus is [...] "one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are." [...] The author of the book of Hebrews clearly purports that Jesus was tempted in the same way as other men (i.e., without supernatural powers). Granted this scriptural passage, <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> sense that Jesus was required to pass these tests before God without relying on powers that other men do not have. For readers the Bible is a medium to follow in Jesus' actions: Fleming writes of the Temptation [...] "...when we begin to question the ways of God... let us pluck up courage from the victory of Christ." [...] Granted this scriptural passage, Jesus was required to pass these tests before God without relying on powers from an unholy source.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the early}} 1980s, Japan has {{produced}} a significant output of characteristically harsh bands, sometimes referred to under the portmanteau Japanoise, with perhaps the best known being Merzbow (pseudonym for the Japanese noise artist Masami Akita who himself {{was inspired by the}} Dada artist Kurt Schwitters's Merz art project of psychological collage). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Akita took Metal Machine Music as a point of departure and further abstracted the noise aesthetic by freeing the sound from guitar based feedback alone, a development that is thought to have heralded noise music as a genre. According to Hegarty (2007), [...] "in many ways <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> sense to talk of noise music since the advent of various types of noise produced in Japanese music, and in terms of quantity this is really to do with the 1990s onwards... with the vast growth of Japanese noise, finally, noise music becomes a genre". Other key Japanese noise artists that contributed to this upsurge of activity include Hijokaidan, Boredoms, C.C.C.C., Incapacitants, KK Null, Yamazaki Maso's Masonna, Solmania, K2, The Gerogerigegege and Hanatarash. Nick Cain of The Wire identifies the [...] "primacy of Japanese Noise artists like Merzbow, Hijokaidan and Incapacitants" [...] as one of the major developments in noise music since 1990.|$|E
2500|$|Scully {{has endured}} {{a pair of}} {{personal}} tragedies in his life. In 1972, his 35-year-old wife, Joan Crawford, died of an accidental medical overdose; the couple {{had been married for}} 15 years. In late 1973, he married Sandra Hunt, who had two children of her own, and they soon had a child together. Scully's eldest son, Michael, died in a helicopter crash at the age of 33 while working for the ARCO Transportation Company. He was inspecting oil pipelines for leaks near Fort Tejon, California {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Northridge earthquake in January 1994. Although Michael's death still haunts him, Scully, a devout Roman Catholic, has said in numerous interviews that he credits his Catholic faith and being able to dive back into his work with helping him ease the burden and grief from losing his wife and son. He has encouraged devotion to the Virgin Mary, saying, [...] "her prayers are more powerful than those of the rest of heaven combined. No one was closer or more devoted to Christ on earth, so <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> sense to see the same thing in heaven. Now, the Blessed Virgin seeks to help her spiritual children get home to spend eternity with her Son." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{way to see}} {{atheroma}} is {{the very}} invasive and costly IVUS ultrasound technology; it gives us the precise volume of the inside intima plus the central media layers of about [...] of artery length. [...] Unfortunately, it gives no information about the structural strength of the artery. Angiography does not visualize atheroma; <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> the blood flow within blood vessels visible. Alternative methods that are non or less physically invasive and less expensive per individual test have been used and are continuing to be developed, such as those using computed tomography (CT; led by the electron beam tomography form, given its greater speed) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The most promising since the early 1990s has been EBT, detecting calcification within the atheroma before most individuals start having clinically recognized symptoms and debility. Interestingly, statin therapy (to lower cholesterol) does not slow the speed of calcification as determined by CT scan. [...] MRI coronary vessel wall imaging, although currently limited to research studies, has demonstrated the ability to detect vessel wall thickening in asymptomatic high risk individuals. [...] As a non-invasive, ionising radiation free technique, MRI based techniques could have future uses in monitoring disease progression and regression. [...] Most visualization techniques are used in research, they are not widely available to most patients, have significant technical limitations, have not been widely accepted and generally {{are not covered by}} medical insurance carriers.|$|E
