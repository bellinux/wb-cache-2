Hickok grew angry and jealous at {{perceived}} slights, and demanded more time alone, which Roosevelt was unable to give; at other times, she attempted unsuccessfully to separate herself from Roosevelt. Though the pair remained friends throughout their lives, they continued to grow apart {{in the years that}} followed. In 1937, Roosevelt wrote to Hickok that [...] "I never meant to <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> in any way, but that is no excuse having done it [...] [...] [...] I am pulling back from all my contacts now [...] [...] [...] Such cruelty & stupidity is unpardonable when you reach my age." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{his playing}} career, Bergkamp {{was accused of}} diving, and was {{referred}} to as a [...] "cheat" [...] and [...] "dirty player" [...] for retaliating against players who had previously challenged him, something his former manager Wenger denied. In an interview with The Times in 2004, he said that while he was at Inter, he realised the importance of being mentally tough in order to survive: [...] "A lot of people there try to <b>hurt</b> <b>you,</b> not just physically but mentally as well, and coming from the easygoing culture in Holland, I had to adopt a tougher approach. There, {{it was a case of}} two strikers up against four or five hard defenders who would stop at nothing." [...] Bergkamp says his aggression often stems from frustration.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, it {{discusses}} American {{culture and}} greed, focusing on Hollywood {{as a place}} of pop stars and illusory dreams. The bridge opens with Madonna saying, [...] "Music stations always play the same songs/I'm bored with the concept of right and wrong". Contemporary author Ben Shapiro noted the verse [...] "seems to be Madonna's credo. Her purposeful degradation of morality has led to monumental success for her-and created a monumentally bad influence for her teenage fans." [...] Further, Madonna questions the Hollywood experience, singing, [...] "How could it <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> when it looked so good?". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted Madonna's vocals in the song are [...] "high-pitched [...] little-girl", with the intention of [...] " [...] the notion of innocence lost".|$|E

500|$|Several {{critics have}} focused on the theme of motherhood. In [...] "Mothers and Daughters/Aging and Dying", Claire Sprague wrote that Lessing often dwells on the theme of mothers passing their {{behaviours}} onto their daughters, and how the cycle of daughters fighting their mothers permeates each generation. The British novelist Jane Rogers said that The Good Terrorist [...] "is as unsparing and incisive about motherhood as it is about the extreme left", and that motherhood here [...] "is terrible": Alice's mother is reduced to despair continually yielding to her selfish daughter's demands; Alice mothers Jasper, and has a similar despairing relationship with him. Rogers added that motherhood is depicted here as a compulsion to protect the weak, despite their propensity to retaliate and <b>hurt</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E

Kennedy had been a fellow lodger two years earlier {{when he was working}} in a box factory, and had become one of her earliest students. She now asked him to join her in opening a Moral Science practice in Lynn; he would see patients and she would teach. He agreed to pay her $1,000 for the previous two years' tuition. Kennedy rented rooms in Lynn in June 1870, and placed a sign in the yard, [...] "Dr. Kennedy"; he was 21 and Eddy 49. The practice became popular.

500|$|... "Acércate" [...] {{was leaked}} onto the Internet {{prior to the}} album's release; a first in Queen's 15-year career. Originally {{entitled}} [...] "No Te Equivoques", it was re-recorded {{in response to the}} infringement and included on the album retitled [...] "Acércate". Reflecting on the situation Queen stated: [...] "Sometimes they try to <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> are when you do well. I'm proud and grateful that Wisin & Yandel have gone with me to the studio to record the song. We have good chemistry and friendship. We tried to change the song and lyrics, but with their agenda, which is tight, and mine too, we could not do it again. We have no idea who hacked, all the music was in a studio and to mobilize it to another was what someone did." [...] The collaboration stemmed from Queen's previous collaboration with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album La Revolución (2009) on [...] "Perfecto" [...] which also featured Yaviah.|$|E

500|$|In February 1870, Wills captained Victoria to a 265-run {{win over}} New South Wales at the MCG. The match {{featured}} Twopenny (Jarrawuk), an Aboriginal paceman who {{was said to}} have been recruited by Lawrence as a foil to Wills' [...] "chucks". Comparing the two, the Melbourne press surmised: [...] "Undoubtedly Wills throws sometimes, but there is some decency about it, some disguise." [...] In March, Victoria trounced a Tasmanian XVI in Launceston under Wills' leadership, though not without criticism of his bowling action. The accusations of throwing were growing louder, and one-time ally Hammersley, now Melbourne's foremost sportswriter, emerged as Wills' most vocal critic. He accused Wills of resorting to throwing to maintain pace as he aged, and criticised him for introducing a type of bouncer designed to injure and intimidate batsmen. The Australasian, Hammersley's newspaper, described Wills' modus operandi: [...] "If I cannot hit your wicket or make you give a chance soon, I'll hit you and <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> if I can. I'll frighten you out." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Battlefield" [...] is a mid-tempo pop and R ballad. It also {{derives from}} the genres of pop rock and soft rock. The {{instrumentation}} of [...] "Battlefield" [...] consists of a bass, piano, drums, percussion and guitar. [...] "Battlefield" [...] is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 144 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major with Sparks' vocal range spanning from the note of A3 to C6. The song's lyrics revolve around [...] "a tumultuous relationship where neither side wants to compromise", as stated by Jocelyn Vena of MTV News. Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Battlefield" [...] {{is based on the}} [...] "love is war" [...] metaphor. During the chorus, Sparks sings: [...] "I never meant to start a war / You know, I never wanna <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> / Don't even know what we're fighting for / Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield." [...] Its bridge features the line: [...] "I guess you'd better go and get your armour".|$|E

But I don't think you should mellow out. That's what Alanis Morissette had you motherfuckers do. If someone falls, pick 'em up. We already let the negative energy out.

When you're looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet in the air and you're performing, and you're feeling your music, how do they expect us to see something bad going on?".

500|$|Although not {{exceptional}} in size at , , Taylor was {{a physical}} fullback. He sought contact on every play, accordant with his philosophy: [...] "Football is a contact sport. You've {{got to make}} them respect you. You've got to punish tacklers. You've got to deal out more misery than the tacklers deal out to you." [...] He was widely acknowledged by his peers {{as one of the}} toughest and meanest players in the NFL. Former quarterback Bobby Layne listed him as one of the one of [...] "Pro Football's 11 Meanest Men" [...] in an article for SPORT magazine in 1964. Packers linebacker Ray Nitschke said, [...] "In 15 years with the pros, he's one of the toughest men I ever played against—and we were on the same team. He'd <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> when you tackled him." [...] He was difficult to tackle, as he fought for every extra yard. Giants linebacker Sam Huff proposed a rule change specifically in Taylor's case; per NFL rules, piling-on after a play invokes an unnecessary roughness penalty, but Huff argued, [...] "You gotta pile on him a little to keep him down." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pretty Hurts" [...] was {{initially}} written by Australian musician Sia Furler {{at her apartment}} in Angelino Heights, Los Angeles.

Sia wrote [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] with American singer Katy Perry in mind, and later e-mailed the song to her. However, Perry failed to read the email, and in what Sia described as an [...] "awkward situation," [...] she then sent the track to the management of Beyoncé and Bajan singer Rihanna. The song was put on hold for eight months by Rihanna's management, who failed to pay the track's fee, and as a result Beyoncé [...] "slid into home base and threw the money down" [...] to secure [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] for herself. Rihanna later decided to record another composition by Sia, [...] "Diamonds", instead. In 2012, American producer Dr. Luke received Beyoncé's cut of [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] and played it to Perry, who later text messaged Sia, saying, [...] "I'm pretty <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> never sent me this song". Sia then responded, stating, [...] "Check your e-mail," [...] to which Perry replied, [...] "It was meant to be with Beyoncé of course".|$|E

500|$|Rosie O'Donnell reacted {{negatively}} to Fink's casting and first solo musical performance. In {{an interview with}} Access Hollywood, she deemed her rendition of [...] "I Know What Boys Like" [...] underwhelming, and stated that it failed to meet her expectations. She called Lauren [...] "so unlikable," [...] and questioned why the producers had not cast a [...] "pretty heavy girl". Fink brushed off O'Donnell's comments. O'Donnell later apologized, and said, [...] "Oh, Ashley – I love your swagger – your acting – your face – your heart – as a famous fat person – I am often asked about the issue… I love the story line – I love the show – and if in any way something I said <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> – I apologize MORE. You are so talented, and I can't wait to hear you belt it…as I know you can—the often misquoted Rosie." [...] Fink was defended by Justin Thompson of Socialite Life, who commented: [...] "I've loved her character and how they've developed her and she's just {{become a source of}} great comedy – is that because she's full-figured? No. Is it because her character is well-written? Yes. It’s kind of sad to see Rosie lambaste what the show is trying to do." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Amor Puro" [...] (Pure Love) is {{in a minor}} key with romantic lyrics, {{a string}} {{ensemble}} and techno synthesizers. Its lyrics focus {{on the meaning of}} true love. Queen sings: [...] "Pure love does not fight, it does not <b>hurt</b> <b>you,</b> love that is pure does not cause you to fall", and described the song as [...] "an honest statement of what love is". [...] "I Do" [...] is a minor-key, mid-tempo pop and R power ballad built on a handclapped rhythm and piano. Lyrically, the song is a message to men and women; Queen sings: [...] "My ladies, if you know better, if he loves you, let him come back. My fellas, if you love her, don't let nothing hold you back, run out and look for her". Queen recorded the song in English because she felt the language worked well with the beat. According to an editor for iTunes, the song [...] "puts her message of female empowerment into a glossy pop ballad, complete with English lyrics and Auto-Tuned vocal." [...] The minor-key [...] "Acércate" [...] (Get Closer) features vocals by Wisin & Yandel and synthesizers; it has been described as [...] "pure reggaeton". The song was praised for the presence of Wisin & Yandel and its hook. Queen previously collaborated with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album, La Revolución (2009), with [...] "Perfecto" [...] (which also featured Yaviah).|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} opener at #12 California, he caught one pass for 28yards and made two rushing {{attempts}} for 16yards. Against Division I FCS James Madison, Smith caught eight passes for 80yards, rushed twice for 22yards and a touchdown, and returned four kickoffs 127yards, including one 81-yard touchdown return. Despite the strong statistical performance, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "To be honest with you, I was kind of expecting more out of Torrey. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him. I'm not surprised at all about the return yards. But I think if you asked Torrey, he has high expectations for himself, too." [...] Smith agreed with the criticism, and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide receiver, he had room for improvement. He recorded five catches for 165yards and two touchdowns in the Middle Tennessee game, and caught four passes for 112yards against Rutgers. He led the team with three receptions for 64yards and a 29-yard touchdown against Clemson, and became the first player in the nation to reach 1,000all-purpose yards on the season. Against Wake Forest, Smith returned six kickoffs 194yards and caught a career-high ten passes for 70yards and a touchdown. For his performance, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week. Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said, [...] "This kid is probably a better receiver [...] He catches the ball better, he's got great foot speed. He can <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> running the ball or catching it. Everywhere you look, he's a problem." ...|$|E
