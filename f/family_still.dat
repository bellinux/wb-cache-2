5|$|Although the Boleyn <b>family</b> <b>still</b> held {{important}} {{positions on}} the Privy Council, Anne had many enemies, including the Duke of Suffolk.

Also opposed to Anne were supporters of reconciliation with Princess Mary (among them the former supporters of Catherine), who had reached maturity. A second annulment was now a real possibility, although it is commonly {{believed that it was}} Cromwell's anti-Boleyn influence that led opponents to look for a way of having her executed.|$|E
