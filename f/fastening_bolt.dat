40|$|Abstract. Prevention of slack in <b>fastening</b> <b>bolt</b> {{has been}} an {{important}} researching subject since fatigue failure can be generally caused by loosening nut. According to the above reason, the super lock bolt with double screw mechanism, which is non-loosening, has been developed for preventing such kind of bolt failure. The objects of the present study are as follows: (1) To clarify the fatigue strength characteristics. (2) To investigate the initiation and propagation behaviour of fatigue crack regarding to the thread root of first pitch. In addition, the mechanism of “fatigue strength of super lock bolt ” is also discussed in this paper and it is confirmed that this bolt shows excellent fatigue strength and non-loosening properties...|$|E

There are no repair shops and gas stations in the earth orbit. Because of the lack of so-called on-orbit servicing (OOS) opportunities, some malfunctioning spacecraft continue operational work with reduced or hardly any performance. The only general modification, which can currently be undertaken to an arbitrary spacecraft in orbit, is a software update. For example, the bispectral infrared detection (BIRD) satellite [1] started in 2001 with a configuration of four high-precision reaction wheels. Losing one after the other and with only one functional remaining, a significant effort has been made to optimize the attitude-control software with regards to the new constraints. Thus, BIRD is still operational, but other hardware failures, e. g., the inability to deploy solar panels, cannot be compensated by modifying the onboard software. In case of TV-SAT 1 [2], solar panel problems (the <b>fastening</b> <b>bolt</b> for the solar array had accidentally not been removed before launch) prevented the use of the Ku-band transmit antenna and subsequently any TV broadcast service after launch. The satellite had to be moved into a graveyard orbit...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of intelligent fastening tool tracking systems for the automotive industry to identify the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolts.</b> In order to accomplish such a task, the position of the tool tip must be identified because the tool tip position coincides {{with the head of the}} <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt</b> while the tool <b>fastens</b> the <b>bolt.</b> The proposed systems utilize an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and another sensor to track the position and orientation of the tool tip. To minimize the position and orientation calculation error, an IMU needs to be calibrated as accurately as possible. This research presents a novel triaxial accelerometer calibration technique that offers a high accuracy. The simulation and experimental results of the accelerometer calibration are presented. To identify the fastening action, an expert system is developed based on the sensor measurements. When a fastening action is identified, the system identifies the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt</b> by using an expert system based on the position and orientation of the tool tip and the position and orientation of the <b>bolt.</b> Since each <b>fastening</b> procedure needs different accuracies and requirements, three different systems are proposed. The first system utilizes a triaxial magnetometer and an IMU to identify the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt.</b> This system calculates the position and orientation by using an IMU. An expert system is used to identify the initial position, stationary state, and the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt.</b> When the tool <b>fastens</b> a <b>bolt,</b> the proposed expert system detects the fastening action by triaxial accelerometer and triaxial magnetometer measurements. When the fastening action is detected, the system corrects the velocity and position error using zero velocity update (ZUPT). By using the corrected tool tip position and orientation, the system can identify the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolts.</b> Then, with the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt</b> position, the position of the IMU is corrected. When the tool is stationary, the system corrects linear velocity error and reduces the position error. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can identify <b>fastened</b> <b>bolts</b> if the angles of the bolts are different or the bolts are not closely placed. This low cost system does not require a line of sight, but has limited position accuracy. The second system utilizes an intelligent system that incorporates Kalman filters (KFs) and a fuzzy expert system to track the tip of a fastening tool and to identify the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt.</b> This system employs one IMU and one encoder-based position sensor to determine the orientation and the centre of mass location of the tool. When the KF is used, the orientation error increases over time due to the integration step. Therefore, a fuzzy expert system is developed to correct the tilt angle error and orientation error. When the tool <b>fastens</b> a <b>bolt,</b> the system identifies the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt</b> by applying the fuzzy expert system. When the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt</b> is identified, the 3 D orientation error of the tool is corrected by using the location and the orientation of the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt</b> and the position sensor outputs. This orientation correction method results in improved reliability in determining the tool tip location. The fastening tool tracking system was experimentally tested in a lab environment, and the results indicate that such a system can successfully identify the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolts.</b> This system not only has a low computational cost but also provides good position and orientation accuracy. The system can be used for most applications because it provides a high accuracy. The third system presents a novel position/orientation tracking methodology by hybridizing one position sensor and one factory calibrated IMU with the combination of a particle filter (PF) and a KF. In addition, an expert system is used to correct the angular velocity measurement errors. The experimental results indicate that the orientation errors of this method are significantly reduced compared to the orientation errors obtained from an EKF approach. The improved orientation estimation using the proposed method leads to a better position estimation accuracy. The experimental results of this system show that the orientation of the proposed method converges to the correct orientation even when the initial orientation is completely unknown. This new method was applied to the fastening tool tracking system. This system provides good orientation accuracy even when the gyroscopes (gyros hereafter) include a small error. In addition, since the orientation error of this system does not grow over time, the tool tip position drift is limited. This system can be applied to the applications where the bolts are closely placed. The position error comparison results of the second system and the third system are presented in this thesis. The comparison results indicate that the position accuracy of the third system is better than that of the second system because the orientation error does not increase over time. The advantages and limitations of all three systems are compared in this thesis. In addition, possible future work on fastening tool tracking system is described as well as applications that can be expanded by using the KF/PF combination method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Rail {{inspection}} is a {{very important}} task in railway maintenance and it is periodically needed for preventing dangerous situations. Inspection is operated manually by trained human operator walking along the track searching for visual anomalies. This monitoring is unacceptable for slowness and lack of objectivity, because the results are related to the ability of the observer to recognize critical situations. The paper presents VISyR, a patent pending real time Visual Inspection System for Railway maintenance, and describes how presence/absence of the <b>fastening</b> <b>bolts</b> that fix the rails to the sleepers is automatically detected. VISyR acquires images from a digital line scan camera. Data are simultaneously preprocessed according to two Discrete Wavelet Transforms, and then provided to two Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Classifiers (MLPNCs). The “cross validation ” of these MLPNCs avoids (practically-at-all) false positive, and reveals the presence/absence of the <b>fastening</b> <b>bolts</b> with an accuracy of 99. 6 % in detecting visible bolts and of 95 % in detecting missing bolts.

40|$|Demands on <b>fastening</b> <b>bolts</b> in {{mechanical}} engineering and automotive industry are discussed in this paper. The possibility of using microstructurally graded material for bolts is derived from this discussion. This material consists of a conventional coarse-grained core or main body and an ultra-fine-grained (UFG) layer surrounding it. Current research focuses on the manufacture of UFG layers by means of incremental metal forming. The examinations were carried out on an UFG material with elevated yield strength. An elasto-plastic model of an M 6 bolt, made of aluminum alloy EN AW- 6082, was set up and the bolt was loaded with tensile forces. The resulting distributions of stress and equivalent plastic deformation were analyzed. Result of this analysis is a recommendation for an optimum thickness of the ultra-fine-grained layer. Bolts from graded materials can withstand higher loads in the groove of the thread, which is the section with the highest load on the bolt. At the same time high toughness in the bolt's core is obtained, which allows its use as a safety component...|$|R

40|$|The {{behaviors}} {{of production and}} relaxation of <b>fastening</b> force in <b>bolted</b> joint for wood construction were experimentally investigated. In the fastening stage, the axial force in <b>bolt</b> and the <b>fastening</b> torque become larger with increasingly <b>fastening</b> the <b>bolt</b> until <b>fastening</b> torque reached at some level. However, the axial force in bolt was hard to increase when <b>fastening</b> the <b>bolt</b> at higher level than that, because of immediate relaxation of axial force in wood members. And in this stage, the compressive strain in wood member was increased at the portion near the washer first, {{and then it was}} distributed {{in the shape of a}} coniform or a fusiform having the tops in both washer sides. The relaxation of axial force in bolt was extremely large in a few minutes after fastening, and the axial force was reduced to about half until 1000 minutes after fastening. Then, the change of axial force in bolt was subjected to the change of relative humidity of circumstance. The relaxation of axial force in bolt developed extremely in the case of initial axial force of above 600 to 800 kgf. Although the axial force in bolt was reduced over 50 percent of initial force, more than 80 percent of compressive strain in wood member was remained even after 1000 minutes after fastening. 木質部材のボルト接合部に関し, ボルト締結時におけるボルト軸カおよび木質部材内のひずみの発現, およびそれらの緩和について実験的にその挙動を明らかにした.

40|$|Modular {{systems have}} been mostly {{researched}} in relatively low-rise structures but, lately, their applications to mid- to high-rise structures began to be reviewed, and research interest in new modularization subjects has increased. The application of modular systems to mid- to high-rise structures requires the structural stability of the frame and connections that consist of units, and {{the evaluation of the}} stiffness of structures that are combined in units. However, the combination of general units causes loss of the cross-section of columns or beams, resulting in low seismic performance and hindering installation works in the field. In addition, the evaluation of a frame considering such a cross-sectional loss is not easy. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a joint that is stable and easy to install. In the study, a rigidly connected modular system was proposed as a moment-resisting frame for a unit modular system, and their joints were developed and their performances were compared. The proposed system changed the ceiling beam into a bracket type to <b>fasten</b> <b>bolts.</b> It can be merged with other seismic force-resisting systems. To verify the seismic performance of the proposed system, a cyclic loading test was conducted, and the rigidly connected joint performance and integrated behavior at the joint of modular units were investigated.
