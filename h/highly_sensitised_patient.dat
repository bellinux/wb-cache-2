40|$|One {{hundred and}} ninety-two {{patients}} received 200 consecutive cadaver renal transplants (158 first and 42 regrafts) and {{were treated with}} triple therapy immunosuppression consisting of low-dose cyclosporin, azathioprine and prednisolone. One-year patient and graft survival rates were 95 % and 82 %, respectively. Against this low rate of graft loss, the proportion of rejection-free patients in the first 3 months was strongly related to matching for HLA-DR (P less than 0. 01), although HLA-DR matching {{was not associated with}} improved graft survival. More grafts were lost to nonimmunological causes than to rejection, and these losses fell into three main categories, namely, losses in elderly and diabetic patients and losses due to renal vascular thrombosis. Thus, triple therapy immunosuppression appears to offer effective immunosuppression, resulting in good graft and patient survival, especially in <b>highly</b> <b>sensitised</b> <b>patients</b> or patients receiving regrafts. There are relatively few serious adverse effects, although elderly and diabetic patients experienced significant morbidity and mortality after transplantation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{increasing}} {{volume of}} {{evidence suggests that}} early contact of children with the allergens of furred pets (especially those produced by cats) may determine a lower risk of developing allergic sensitisation to these materials. A possible explanation of this data is that an early inhalation of high levels of the major cat allergen Fel d 1 induces the production of IgG and IgG 4 antibodies with a “protective” effect. Other authors {{have shown that the}} prevalence of allergic sensitisation to cats, in adults, is reduced in those patients exposed to the lowest and highest levels of the allergens. On the contrary, the risk of developing sensitisation to cats is significantly higher when the patients were exposed to intermediate levels of Fel d 1. Moreover, epidemiological studies have demonstrated a relatively low prevalence of cat allergy (about 10 %) in some countries where rates of cat ownership are high. This data confirms the role of indirect exposure to pet allergens in inducing allergic sensitisation. Clothes of pet owners have been indicated as the carriers for the dispersal of these allergens in pet-free environments. However, it is {{important to point out that}} exposure of <b>highly</b> <b>sensitised</b> <b>patients</b> to relevant amounts of pet allergens (such as in a pet shows/shops) may determine a dramatic exacerbation of nasal and/or bronchial symptoms...|$|R

We quantified the panel reactive antibody (PRA) by microlymphocytotoxicity (MLCC), and we analysed anti-HLA class I and class II IgG specific antibody repertoire by Luminex {{before and after}} IVIg infusion alone in HS patients awaiting kidney transplantation. Five patients received three monthly infusions of 1 g/kg of IVIg. Serum samples collected pre and post IVIg treatment were submitted for PRA analysis by MLCC. Anti-class I and anti-class II antibody specificities were then tested by Luminex. We focused on the anti-HLA class I and class II antibodies directed against HLA expressed by a previous graft. We also analysed the anti-HLA antibody repertoire in three patients who had not received IVIg infusion. The PRA level determined by MLCC decreased significantly {{in one of the}} five patients, dropping from 40 % to 17 %. The Luminex assay showed fluctuations of the anti-HLA antibody levels over time, but no significant longterm modifications of the anti-HLA antibody repertoire were observed, even in the patient with a strong and prolonged reduction of the PRA determined by MLCC. Our results show that IVIg at 1 g/kg is not sufficient to reduce PRA and does not modify the repertoire of specific anti-HLA antibody determined by Luminex...|$|R

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical evolution of 30 <b>highly</b> <b>sensitised</b> deceased donor kidney transplants {{and the influence of}} different timing of B cell directed treatment and its importance in the outcome of these patients. All recipients had negative complement dependent lymphocytotoxicity cytotoxic T cell crossmatch and no identified anti human leucocyte antigen class I donor specific antibodies. T cell flow crossmatch was performed within 24 h of transplantation with serum obtained pretransplant (historic, recent or baseline). Posttransplant flow crossmatch were performed prospectively starting on the 3 rd posttransplantation day. The immunosuppressive regime included thymoglobulin, tacrolimus, mycofenolate mofetil and steroids. Positive flow crossmatch occurred in 20 / 29 patients by the 3 rd posttransplantation day, and in 17 / 27 patients after the 3 rd posttransplantation day. All patients were started on intravenous immunoglobulin before transplantation: in nine patients (group A) at 400 mg/kg/day for five days; in the remaining 21 patients (group B), as a continued infusion of 2 g/kg during 48 h. In group A, Rituximab was added only in the presence of antibody mediated rejection; in group B, introduced on the 3 rd posttransplantation day whenever a positive flow crossmatch (with serum obtained pre or posttransplant) was reported. Antibody mediated rejection was observed in 44. 4 % of patients in group A, and 19 % of those in group B. Mean follow-up was 12. 2 ± 5. 5 months. Overall allograft survival was 76. 6 %, 81 % in group B, and 66. 6 % in group A. At last follow up, mean serum creatinine was 1. 3 ± 0. 6 mg/dl. Renal transplantation with pretransplant positive flow crossmatch is highly associated with antibody mediated rejection, despite introduction of intravenous immunoglobulin pretransplantation.

40|$|Abstract Following {{five decades}} of kidney transplantation, {{increasingly}} high risk immunological kidney transplantation (which previously was considered as sub-optimal) are carried out. The risk stratification {{with the current}} available assays have allowed safe transplantation in low risk non-sensitised patients and direct transplantation in high risk <b>highly</b> <b>sensitised</b> <b>patients</b> by removal of circulating donor specific antibodies (DSA) with reasonable outcomes. However, {{a large number of}} patients with chronic kidney disease and with low or intermediate antibody levels measured by current assay, the best way forward is uncertain resulting in denial of transplantation in some cases. Whilst in other cases, the solid phase Luminex assay may under or overestimate the risks of rejection and graft failure following direct kidney transplantation. Currently only IgG-class of DSA is considered immunologically important and routinely measured in clinical laboratories. Other bio-physiological characteristics such as class, sub-class and binding kinetics of DSA may be more specific for risk stratification of immunological risks. In this thesis, we studied effect of de novo IgM class of HLA-specific antibodies on outcome of kidney transplantation and characterised binding kinetics and strength of HLA-specific antibodies. De novo IgM or IgG HLA-specific responses alone were not associated with adverse outcomes following kidney transplantation. Presence of both IgM and IgG responses, however, was associated with poor graft function at 36 months. There was no temporal relationship of antibody response and episodes of rejections. De novo Donor specific responses were less frequent compared to non-specific responses. A shorter follow-up and use of modern triple immunosuppressant therapy (Tacrolimus, Mycophenolate and Steroid) may explain this. Binding kinetics measured by biosensor assay- surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on purified monoclonal HLA-specific antibodies showed binding kinetics and strength differed between HLA alleles despite same epitope and paratope interactions. There was a tendency towards higher affinity and faster association rate for HLA protein that was the initial immunizing antigen for the corresponding monoclonal HLA-specific antibodies. The dissociation constant (KD) of human monoclonal HLA-specific antibodies range between 10 - 8 to 10 - 10 M. Thermodynamic analysis showed higher Gibbs free energy released for interactions with higher binding strength. The binding strength of mixed monoclonal HLA-specific antibodies is generally average of the strength of individual monoclonal HLA-specific antibodies. Enriched polyclonal HLA-specific antibodies from clinical sample gave distinct binding response on bio-sensor based on SPR assay. Quantification of polyclonal HLA-specific antibodies using sandwich ELISA and SPR allowed quantitative measurement of binding kinetics and strengths. A range of binding strength was observed between patients and within same patient antibodies of different affinities was observed. Thus the antibodies could be grouped in four groups based on the strength of binding and this can serve as additional biomarker for risk stratifications. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: for {{suitable}} patients, renal transplantation {{is considered}} the optimal modality of renal replacement therapy, with availability of donor organs {{limiting the number of}} transplants undertaken. The 2006 kidney allocation policy was developed to ensure equity of allocation to patients on the transplant waiting list, whilst still achieving a good donor/recipient match. This study aims to describe the characteristics of the kidney transplant waiting list and variations in median waiting times. Methods: demographics and clinical characteristics of all patients listed for a kidney only transplant in the UK on 1 st January 2011 were examined. Renal unit variations were explored. Patients listed between January 2006 and December 2009 were included in analysis of waiting times to transplant. Results: at the beginning of 2011, there were 6, 699 patients registered active for kidney only transplant in UK; a prevalence rate of 107 pmp. The median age of prevalent listed patients was 53 years, with 8 % aged 70 or above. Of the patients listed, 84 % had started renal replacement therapy (RRT), 59 % were male, 28 % were from ethnic minorities, 50 % had blood group type O, 28 % were defined as difficult to HLA match and 23 % were <b>highly</b> <b>sensitised</b> (calculated HLA antibody reaction frequency 85 %). Median waiting time to transplant was 38 months. Waiting time was shorter for White patients (36 months) compared to Asian or Black patients (46 months), and was doubled in <b>highly</b> <b>sensitised</b> compared to un-sensitised patients. Conclusions: intercentre variation was observed in the rate of wait-listing and in the proportion of listed patients across different ethnic groups, age, blood groups and level of sensitisation. This may reflect differences in baseline population characteristics as well as individual centre practice patterns.

Further studies demonstrated that anti-HLA antibodies were associated with an inflammatory phenotype, but anti-donor ABO specific antibodies did not despite the activation of complement. Thus, inhibiting terminal complement activation, whilst reducing early antibody-mediated rejection did not abrogate all inflammation which was associated with the presence of IgM DSA. Reproducible and standardised assays are needed for antibody assessment in order to make good clinical decisions to improve patient outcomes. Further studies are needed to stop production or block mechanisms of ongoing cellular infiltrate to improve patient outcomes. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Almost 4 % of the {{population}} suffer from food allergy which is an adverse reaction to food with an underlying immunological mechanism.  AIMS—To characterise {{one of the most}} frequent IgE defined food allergens, fish parvalbumin.  METHODS—Tissue and subcellular distribution of carp parvalbumin was analysed by immunogold electron microscopy and cell fractionation. Parvalbumin was purified to homogeneity, analysed by mass spectrometry and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and its allergenic activity was analysed by IgE binding and basophil histamine release tests.  RESULTS—The isoelectric point (pI) 4. 7  form of carp parvalbumin, a three EF-hand calcium-binding protein, was purified to homogeneity. CD analysis revealed a remarkable stability and refolding capacity of calcium-bound parvalbumin. This may explain why parvalbumin, despite cooking and exposure to the gastrointestinal tract, can <b>sensitise</b> <b>patients.</b> Purified parvalbumin reacted with IgE of more than 95 % of individuals allergic to fish, induced dose-dependent basophil histamine release and contained, on average, 83 % of the IgE epitopes present in other fish species. Calcium depletion reduced the IgE binding capacity of parvalbumin which, according to CD analysis, may be due to conformation-dependent IgE recognition.  CONCLUSIONS—Purified carp parvalbumin represents an important cross reactive food allergen. It can be used for in vitro and in vivo diagnosis of fish-induced food allergy. Our finding that the apo-form of parvalbumin had a greatly reduced IgE binding capacity indicates that this form may be a candidate for safe immunotherapy of fish-related food allergy.    Keywords: food allergy; parvalbumin; circular dichroism; epitopes; antibodies; immunochemistr...|$|R

Drawing upon interviews with 22 young athletes aged on average 20 years, this article examines {{the ways in which they}} used observations of the ageing and old age of their family members to shape the ways in which they anticipated the ageing of their own bodies. The representations of the bodies, roles and lifestyles of their parents and grandparents provided â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 narrative mapsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 that held pre-presentations of the young athletesâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 possible futures. They included both preferred and feared scenarios about middle age and old age, particularly the opportunities they would have for maintaining physical activity and the appearance of their bodies. The young menâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s and the young womenâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s narrative maps differed: the womenâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s accounts of old age gave more prominence to the loss of appearance, while the menâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s focused more on the loss of control and independence. The informants were <b>highly</b> <b>sensitised</b> to the biological dimensions of ageing which, for them, meant the inevitable decline of the material body, especially in performance terms, and both genders recognised social dimensions, particularly that responsibilities to jobs and family would constrain the time available for exercise. To understand more fully young athletesâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 experiences of self-ageing, and the family as a key arena for the embodied projection and inscription of ageing narratives, further research is required...|$|R
40|$|Cognitive models {{suggest that}} anxiety is {{associated}} with the presence of a <b>highly</b> <b>sensitised</b> threat detection mechanism which, once activated, leads to the automatic allocation and focusing of attention on the source of threat (review by Bar-Haim, Lamy, Pergamin, Bakermans-Kranenburg & Ijzendoorn, 2007). Previous studies have only ever considered the detection of singleton threat targets in anxiety. The threat detection system should also be configured to rapidly detect signs of impending danger in situations where there is a possibility of multiple threats. Given multiple threats, it is unclear whether a more advantageous strategy for threat detection in anxious individuals is to localise and focus attention on one threat stimulus or to distribute attention widely (see Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos & Calvo, 2007). To address this theoretical question, we conducted a reaction time redundant signals study in which participants were asked to indicate {{the presence or absence of}} an angry or happy target face in displays containing no targets, one target or two targets. In all conditions, the task was to detect the presence of at least one target. We used measures of processing capacity (e. g., capacity coefficient, Miller and Grice inequalities; see Wenger & Townsend, 2000) to assess whether, at all time points, the fastest RTs in the redundant target condition (e. g., two target condition) could be predicted from the fastest RTs in the single target conditions. Eye-movements were also measured during the study. Significant correlations showed that anxiety was associated with increased processing capacity for threatening faces but only at early time points in target detection. The results also demonstrated that significantly fewer eye-movements were made to targets when anxiety was high. The data are consistent with anxiety influencing threat detection via a broadly tuned attentional mechanism. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Apple allergy manifests as {{two main}} groups of {{clinical}} entities reflecting different patterns of allergen sensitization: oral allergy syndrome (OAS) and generalized symptoms (GS). We analysed the sensitization profile {{to a wide}} panel of different components of food allergens (rMal d 1, Mal d 2, rMal d 3, rMal d 4, rPru p 3, rBet v 1 and Pho d 2) for a population of Mediterranean patients with OAS and GS to apple. Patients (N = 81) {{with a history of}} apple allergy that could be confirmed by positive prick-prick test and/or double-blind-placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), were included. Skin prick test (SPT) and ELISA were performed using a panel of inhalant, fruit and nut allergens. ELISA and ELISA inhibition studies were performed in order to analyse the sensitization patterns. Thirty-five cases (43. 2 %) had OAS and 46 (56. 8 %) GS. SPT showed a significantly higher number of positive results with peach, cherry and hazelnut in those with GS. ELISA showed a significantly high percentage of positive cases to rMal d 3, rMal d 4, rPru p 3 and Pho d 2 in patients with OAS and GS compared to controls, and to rBet v 1 in patients with OAS vs controls and between OAS and GS patients. Three different patterns of recognition were detected: positive to LTP (rMal d 3 or rPru p 3), positive to profilin (rMal d 4 and Pho d 2), or positive to both. There were also patients with rMal d 1 recognition who showed cross-reactivity to rBet v 1. In an apple allergy population with a high incidence of pollinosis different patterns of sensitization may occur. LTP is most often involved in those with GS. Profilin, though more prevalent in patients with OAS, has been shown to <b>sensitise</b> <b>patients</b> with both types of symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Gastro-allergic {{anisakiasis}} and Anisakis sensitisation associated chronic urticaria are diseases which {{differ in}} their IgE and IgG 4 responses against both crude extract and specific allergens. Anisakis and Ascaris are closely related nematodes that usually cause problems with specificity in immunodiagnostics. In this study we measured IgE and IgG 4 antibodies against Anisakis simplex sensu lato (s. l.) and Ascaris suum haemoglobins in sera of 21 gastro-allergic anisakiasis and 23 chronic urticaria patients. We used a capture ELISA with the anti-Anisakis haemoglobin monoclonal antibody 4 E 8 g, which also recognises Ascaris haemoglobin. In addition, we determined specific IgE and IgG 4 to both nematodes by indirect ELISA and immunoblotting. Anti-A. simplex s. l. haemoglobin IgE and IgG 4 levels were higher in gastro-allergic anisakiasis than in chronic urticaria patients (P = 0. 002 and 0. 026, respectively). Surprisingly, no patient had detectable IgE levels against A. suum haemoglobin. Finally, we carried out an in silico study of the B-cell epitopes of both haemoglobin molecules. Five epitopes were predicted in Anisakis pegreffii and four in A. suum haemoglobin. The epitope propensity values of Anisakis haemoglobin in the equivalent IgE binding region of the allergenic haemoglobin Chi t 1 from Chironomus thummi, were higher those of the Ascaris haemoglobin. In conclusion, we describe A. simplex haemoglobin as a new major allergen (Ani s 13), being recognised by a large number (64. 3 %) of <b>sensitised</b> <b>patients</b> and up to 80. 9 % in patients with gastro-allergic anisakiasis. The presence of a specific epitope and the different values of epitope propensity between Anisakis and Ascaris haemoglobin could explain the lack of cross-reactivity between the two molecules. The absence of IgE reactivity to Ascaris haemoglobin in Anisakis patients makes Anisakis haemoglobin (Ani s 13) a potential candidate for developing more specific diagnosis tools...|$|R
40|$|Sensitivity to chromium, cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, and {{titanium}} was {{studied by}} patch tests in 50 {{patients who had}} received total joint replacements. Nineteen (38 %) were sensitive {{to one or more}} of the metals. In 23 patients non-traumatic failure of the prosthesis had occurred, and 15 of these patients were sensitive to metal. Out of 27 patients with no evidence of prosthesis loosening, four were sensitive to nickel and cobalt or nickel only. Dermatological reactions occurred in 13 patients after surgery; in only eight, however, was there evidence of metal sensitivity. These findings indicate that metal-on-metal total joint replacements may <b>sensitise</b> the <b>patient</b> to metals contained in the prosthesis. Although there is a high incidence of prosthesis failure among metal-sensitive patients it remains uncertain whether the loosening causes the sensitisation or vice versa...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{assess whether}} {{exposure}} to house dust mite (HDM) allergens hampers a tapering off of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dosage in HDM-sensitive asthma patients. METHODS: Asthma <b>patients</b> <b>sensitised</b> to HDM allergens and using ICS {{were selected from}} general practices for this observational study. Dust samples from bed mattresses were taken to assess exposure ('no', 'low', 'intermediate' or 'high') to HDM allergens with a semi-quantitative test (Acarex). Patients were trained to use a self management plan to adjust the dose of ICS according to symptoms and peak flow. The observation period was three months. RESULTS: Outcomes from 123 patients were analysed. Within the 'no' and 'low' HDM exposure groups the proportion of patients who increased the dosage of their ICS medication was {{significantly lower than the}} proportion who tapered off or remained on the same dose of ICS. The group with high exposure to HDM allergens had the highest proportion of patients who increased their dose of ICS (p = 0. 055). CONCLUSIONS: High exposure to HDM allergens seems to coincide with the use of higher dose ICS treatment in asthma <b>patients</b> <b>sensitised</b> to HDM allergens...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Background: The {{prevalence}} of food allergy in South Africa is unknown, but previously {{thought to be}} low, particularly in black South Africans. We hypothesised that food allergies would be low in Xhosa patients, even those at increased risk of food allergy such as children with atopic dermatitis (AD). This study aimed to determine the {{prevalence of}}, patterns and risk factors for, IgE-mediated food allergy in South African children with moderate to severe AD. It is the first food allergy prevalence study in South Africa to utilise controlled food challenges and component analysis, and is unique for its comparison of food allergy patterns between {{ethnic groups in the}} same geographical area. Methodology: This was a prospective, observational study in a paediatric university hospital in Cape Town. Children with moderate to severe AD, aged 6 months to 10 years, were randomly recruited from the dermatology clinic. They were assessed for sensitisation and allergy by questionnaire, skin prick tests (SPT), Immuno Solid Phase Allergen Chip (ISAC) test and incremental food challenges. <b>Sensitised</b> <b>patients</b> were also tested for specific IgE by ImmunoCAP test. Results: One hundred participants (59 black Africans and 41 of mixed race) were enrolled, median age 42 months. There were high overall rates of food sensitisation (66 %) and food allergy (40 %). Egg (25 %) and peanut (24 %) were the most common allergies. Black participants had comparable sensitisation (69 % vs 61 %) but lower allergy rates (34 % vs 46 %) than mixed race participants. This was especially evident for peanut allergy (15 % vs 37 %, p= 0. 01). Early onset AD (< 6 months), severe eczema, and young age < 2 years were significant risk factors for food allergy. The ISAC test was less sensitive than SPT and ImmunoCAP tests. Only 42 % of cases of perceived food allergy were confirmed as true food allergy...|$|R
