5|$|The poem is a {{detailed}} description of several objects, including a photo album and the camera that took the pictures in it, and is essentially about the nostalgia that the speaker, presumably Gibson himself, feels towards the details of his family's history: the painstaking descriptions of the houses they lived in, the cars they drove, and <b>even</b> <b>their</b> pets.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant <b>even</b> <b>their</b> small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E

5|$|In October 1939, Hitler and Mussolini {{concluded}} the South Tyrol Option Agreement {{under which the}} German-speaking population of South Tyrol was given the choice of complete Italianisation—abandoning their German language and <b>even</b> <b>their</b> personal names—or emigrating to Nazi Germany. As a result, Hess {{and his family were}} forced to return to Germany. Attempts to emigrate to Switzerland or Brazil failed, so they moved briefly back to Düsseldorf before resettling in Unterwössen, a small village in the district of Traunstein in the far south-east of Bavaria, where his daughter attended the Landschulheim Marquartstein, a local gymnasium and boarding school.|$|E
5|$|In the strike-shortened 1982 season, the Giants {{lost their}} first two games before the strike, and their first game upon returning. They won their next three games to <b>even</b> <b>their</b> record at 3–3. Perkins then {{announced}} that he was leaving to take the head coaching job at Alabama after the season, and the team lost the next two games, effectively eliminating them from the playoffs (despite defeating the Eagles in the season finale to go 4–5). Taylor remained a bright spot, repeating as the league's Defensive Player of the Year. Young chose Bill Parcells, the Giants' defensive coordinator, as the team's new head coach.|$|E
5|$|Berger's evasion of Wehrmacht-imposed {{recruiting}} restrictions {{came to a}} head in June, {{when the}} Chief of the OKW Operations Staff, Generalmajor Alfred Jodl initiated an investigation of SS recruiting operations within the Reich. The result was that around 15,000 SS inductions were held up by various Wehrmacht military district headquarters. Berger became aware of Jodl's inquiry and advised Himmler that <b>even</b> <b>their</b> inquiries had underestimated his success, giving the example that the Wehrmacht believed he had exceeded the June quota for SS-Division-Totenkopf by 900 men, when in fact the true figure was 1,164. He boasted to Himmler that during the whole recruiting campaign, he had signed up 15,000 men for SS-Division-Totenkopf, when Hitler had only authorised the recruiting of 4,000 for the division in the same period. To justify his actions, Berger pointed to the fact that, just before the French surrender, Hitler had ordered the release of over-age SS reservists. In the SS-Division-Totenkopf, this meant 13,246 of the 20,000-strong formation.|$|E

5|$|In a {{small sample}} of 11 {{deceased}} dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7years (maximum 15.9yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41years {{with a standard deviation of}} 2.36years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and <b>even</b> <b>their</b> teeth until their final days.|$|E
5|$|The {{bombing was}} planned and {{performed}} by two Vietcong agents who escaped uninjured and were never captured. Nguyen Thanh Xuan recollected his involvement to historian Stanley Karnow {{after the war}} had ended. In late-November, Xuan and his comrade received orders from a Vietcong intermediary to bomb the Brinks Hotel. The building housed United States Army officers, including lieutenant colonels and majors, and attracted off-duty personnel with its highly regarded food and drink, rooftop seating areas and movie screenings. It was a six-story building and had 193bedrooms. The Vietcong duo observed their target over the next month, mixing with the crowds in the busy street outside. Noting that South Vietnamese officers mingled freely with Americans, they obtained ARVN uniforms from Saigon's black market, enabling them to get closer. Xuan disguised himself as a military chauffeur, while his partner dressed as a South Vietnamese major. They mingled with the real officers {{so that they could}} copy their mannerisms, speaking style and <b>even</b> <b>their</b> way of smoking. The Vietcong pair then procured the two cars and explosives needed for the operation.|$|E
5|$|The gods were {{believed}} to manifest in many forms. The Egyptians had a complex conception of the human soul, consisting of several parts. The spirits of the gods were composed {{of many of these}} same elements. The ba was the component of the human or divine soul that affected the world around it. Any visible manifestation of a god's power could be called its ba; thus, the sun was called the ba of Ra. A depiction of a deity was considered a ka, another component of its being, which acted as a vessel for that deity's ba to inhabit. The cult images of gods that were the focus of temple rituals, as well as the sacred animals that represented certain deities, {{were believed}} to house divine bas in this way. Gods could be ascribed many bas and kas, which were sometimes given names representing different aspects of the god's nature. Everything in existence was said {{to be one of the}} kas of Atum the creator god, who originally contained all things within himself, and one deity could be called the ba of another, meaning that the first god is a manifestation of the other's power. Divine body parts could act as separate deities, like the Eye of Ra and Hand of Atum, both of which were personified as goddesses. The gods were so full of life-giving power that <b>even</b> <b>their</b> bodily fluids could transform into other living things; humankind was said to have sprung from the creator god's tears, and the other deities from his sweat.|$|E

5|$|The young Ahmad ibn Tulun {{received}} a thorough education, involving military {{training at the}} new Abbasid capital of Samarra and studies in Islamic theology at Tarsus, acquiring a reputation not only for his knowledge but also for his pious and ascetic way of life. He became popular among his fellow Turks, who would confide secrets and entrust their money and <b>even</b> <b>their</b> women to him. While at Tarsus, Ibn Tulun fought in the frontier wars with the Byzantine Empire. There he also met another senior Turkish leader, Yarjukh, whose daughter, variously given as Majur or Khatun, became his first wife {{and the mother of}} his eldest son, Abbas, and his daughter Fatimah. The sources also report that during his time at Tarsus, Ibn Tulun had ties to Caliph al-Mutawakkil's vizier Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan, and the latter's cousin Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khaqan. On one occasion, while returning to Samarra, he saved a caravan bearing a caliphal envoy returning from Constantinople from a Bedouin raiding party, and accompanied it to Samarra. This act gained him the favour of Caliph al-Musta'in (r. 862–866), as well as a thousand gold dinars and the hand of the slave Miyas, the mother of his second son, Khumarawayh. When the Caliph abdicated and went into exile at Wasit in 866, he chose Ibn Tulun to be his guard. Qubayha, the mother of the new caliph, al-Mu'tazz (r. 866–869), schemed to remove the deposed al-Musta'in, and offered Ibn Tulun the governorship of Wasit if he would murder him. Ibn Tulun refused and was replaced by another, who carried out the deed. Ibn Tulun himself played no part in the assassination, but gave his master a burial and returned to Samarra.|$|E
