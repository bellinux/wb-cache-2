25|$|The table below {{illustrates}} {{the capacity of}} a light rail train (the Siemens S70) {{compared to that of}} a standard car with five seats. The average length of a standard five-seat car is about 4.74 metres. The length of a Siemens S70 light rail vehicle is 27.7 meters, approximately the same length as 5.8 cars. The maximum occupancy of a five-seat automobile car is five people. The maximum capacity of the Siemens S70 is 220 people. This means that one metre in a car has a capacity of one person and one metre in a light rail vehicle has a capacity of almost eight persons, so the capacity of light rail is about eight times as high as that of an average consumer car, if only the length of the vehicles is taken into consideration. The average width of an automobile is about 1.77 metres, while the average width of the Siemens S70 is about 2.7 metres. The area of an average consumer car is about 8.4m², while the area taken up by a light rail car is about 74.8m². In an automobile car, each square metre <b>has</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> only 0.6 persons, while each square metre in a light rail car <b>has</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> 2.9 persons. This means that a light rail vehicle is significantly more capacity-effective than a consumer car is. Height is not taken into consideration, because it is not normally a problem given minimum-clearance regulations for underpasses.|$|E
