40|$|<b>Full</b> <b>revaluation</b> of a {{portfolio}} based on Monte Carlo simulation {{can be very}} burdensome from the computational point of view. In this paper we develop a <b>full</b> <b>revaluation</b> of a middle-size Italian Bank portfolio for Value at Risk (VaR) computation on Avanade Grid Architecture (AGA. NET) addressing performance and trustworthiness issues. Moreover, we compare the grid implementa-tion with the delta-gamma approximation based on the Fast Fourier algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Risk {{management}} information systems {{are designed to}} overcome the problem of aggregating data across diverse trading units. The design of an information system depends on the risk measurement methodology that a firm chooses. Inherent {{in the design of}} both a risk {{management information}} system and a risk measurement methodology is a tradeoff between the accuracy of the resulting measures of risk and the burden of computing them. Technical progress will make this tradeoff more favorable over time, leading firms to implement more accurate methodologies, such as <b>full</b> <b>revaluation</b> of nonlinear positions. The current and likely future improvements in risk management information systems make feasible new ways of collecting aggregate data on firms' risk-taking activities.
