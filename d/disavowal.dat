The problem was quickly resolved locally, but Rear Admiral Henry T.

5|$|Ten {{days later}} Lord Kenmare (who {{had not been}} in Dublin at the time) denied that he had given the least {{authority}} to any person to make any such statement in his name. However, his <b>disavowal</b> came too late: the anti-Catholic party in the convention had found time to organize themselves, and when the intended Reform Bill took shape it was known that the admission of Roman Catholics to the franchise was not to form part of the scheme.|$|E

Since then, this phrase became popular and was widely used as anti-Soviet Union propaganda term in the Western countries.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{despite the}} Council's {{official}} <b>disavowal</b> of Mangin's layout of future streets, {{as the city}} grew the Mangin-Goerck Plan became the de facto reference for where new streets were built, and when the Commissioners' Plan was revealed in 1811, {{the area of the}} plan which the public had been warned was inaccurate and speculative had been accepted wholesale by the Commission, their plan being almost identical to Mangin's in that area.|$|E
25|$|Converting {{adherents of}} other {{religions}} is widely accepted within Christianity. Many Christian organizations {{believe that they}} have a duty to make converts among every people. In recent years, ecumenism and dialogue between different religions has been endorsed by many official representatives of the Christian churches, as a way of effecting reconciliation between Christian people and people of other faiths, leading to many cases of reconciliation. In some cases, this endorsement is accompanied by a complete <b>disavowal</b> of all proselytizing efforts under the banner of religious pluralism.|$|E

25|$|Many of the movement's ideas, {{including}} plural eldership, <b>disavowal</b> of a clergy-laity distinction, {{and worship}} {{centered around the}} Lord's Supper, were adopted from the Plymouth Brethren, a conservative, low church, nonconformist, Evangelical movement whose history began in Dublin, Ireland, in the late 1820s. From 1930 to 1935, there was communication internationally between the local churches and the Raven-Taylor group of Exclusive Brethren, which saw the churches in China as a parallel work of God. However, Nee and other Chinese leaders disagreed with their prohibition of celebrating The Lord's Supper with Christians outside of their own meetings. Matters {{came to a head}} when it became known that Nee had worshiped with non-Brethren Christians, including T. Austin Sparks in London and Thornton Stearns in Hartford, during a 1933 visit to the United Kingdom and North America. After a series of letters exchanged between leaders in New York, London, and Shanghai over a two-year period, on 31 August 1935, the brethren in London sent communication to Shanghai terminating their fellowship.|$|E
25|$|Outside {{analysis}} from Peter Jones, a linguistics professor at Sheffield Hallam University, argued that Curtiss' earlier accounts of Genie's speech, {{up to and}} including her dissertation, were more accurate than those from after 1977. He argued that in these later analyses Curtiss did not provide sufficient evidence for many of her later conclusions, saying that she neither examined the utterances she cited in significant detail nor presented them in a manner conducive to doing so, and in a few instances asserted that Curtiss' data outright contradicted her conclusions. Jones wrote that, despite the tone of Curtiss' later works and interviews, he found nothing either suggesting reevaluation of her earlier arguments or <b>disavowal</b> of any of her earlier conclusions. In addition, he wrote that Curtiss did not release enough information about Genie's speech from after mid-1975 to determine exactly what, if any, grammatical abilities she had lost, and that the complete lack of data from any time after early January 1978 rendered it impossible {{to determine the extent to}} which her language had regressed.|$|E
25|$|Their next son, {{the future}} King Edward IV, {{was born in}} Rouen on 28 April 1442 and {{immediately}} baptised privately in a small side chapel. He would later be accused of illegitimacy by his cousin, Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and by his own brother, George, Duke of Clarence, a common method of discrediting political enemies. George and Warwick were in dispute with Edward {{at the time and}} seeking to overthrow him as king. The claims would later be dismissed. Nonetheless, some modern historians give serious consideration to the question, and use Edward's date of birth as supporting evidence: assuming Edward was not premature (there being no evidence either way), Richard of York would have been several days' march from Cecily at the time of conception and the baby's baptism was a simple and private affair, unlike that of his younger brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, which was public and lavish). This is countered by other historians, however, who point out that Cecily's husband could easily, by the military conventions of the time, have returned briefly to Rouen, where Cecily was living at the time, while baptism conventions of the time meant that a low-key baptism would be more likely due to Richard of York's relatively low political standing at the time and fears for the baby's survival. If the difference in baptisms was to be taken as a <b>disavowal</b> of an otherwise acknowledged and cherished heir, it would not only be a humiliation of a wife Richard otherwise valued before and after Edward's birth, but also a personal and political humiliation. In any case, Richard acknowledged the baby as his own, which established legal paternity.|$|E

The disclosure is more nuanced than is suggested by the term “disavowal”.

40|$|The celebrated philosopher-physicist Pierre Duhem {{appears to}} {{maintain}} virtually contradictory views. On the one hand, {{he claims that}} science does not aim to explain natural phenomena, where he assumes that an “explanation” strives to reveal the natural world underpinnings hiding “behind the veil” of observable phenomena. Despite these strong <b>disavowals,</b> he also insists that successful scientific theories should converge on “natural classifications” which allegedly provide “hints concerning the true affinities of things. ” But won’t such relationships also lie “behind the veil”? These warring inclinations have created significant exegetical confusion, leading his interpreters to classify him as an antirealist, a realist and everything else in between. Duhem is clearly trying to get across some important methodological lesson about science. But what is it? 	The trick is to align his philosophy more closely with the forms of physics he endorses. On this basis, I argue that Duhem’s <b>disavowals</b> of “explanation’’ actually represent arguments against a dynamic laws picture of science: the doctrine that science must seek laws that track material systems according to the basic patterns of D-N explanation. He argues that many of nature’s most important hidden quantities (e. g., entropy and potential energy) were not discovered in a dynamical manner but were instead uncovered by stringing together relationships in the “quasi-static” manner employed in thermodynamics. Indeed, it is the deep relationships of the latter subject of the latter subject that supply paradigms of the “natural classifications” that Duhem seeks. 	Once one follows through {{the details of his}} recommendations, employing concrete scientific examples, one realizes that Duhem’s reflections on the scientific method greatly enlarge our appreciation of what the many varieties of “good science” can look like. This challenges many dogmatic presumptions about the scientific methodology that still prevail in contemporary philosophy of science. ...|$|R
40|$|Since unification, German {{culture has}} {{experienced}} a boom in discourses on generation, family and place. Linda Shortt reads this as symptomatic of a wider quest for belonging that mobilises attachment to counter the effects of postmodern deterritorialisation and globalisation. Investigating twenty-first century narratives of belonging by Reinhard Jirgl, Christoph Hein, Angelika Overath, Florian Illies, Juli Zeh, Stephan Wackwitz, Uwe Timm and Peter Schneider, Shortt examines how the desire to belong is repeatedly unsettled by disturbances of lineage and tradition. In this way, she combines an analysis of supermodernity with an enquiry into German memory contests on the National Socialist era, 1968 and 1989 that continue to shape identity in the Berlin Republic. Exploring a spectrum of narratives that range from agitated <b>disavowals</b> of place to romances of belonging, this study illuminates the topography of belonging in contemporary Germany...|$|R
