25|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{that as a}} {{consequence}} of the above Orange Book definition, the boundaries of the TCB depend closely upon the specifics of how the security policy is fleshed out. In the network server example above, even though, say, a Web server that serves a multi-user application is not part of the operating system's TCB, it has the responsibility of performing access control so that the users cannot usurp the identity and privileges of each other. In this sense, it definitely is part of the TCB of the larger computer system that comprises the UNIX server, the user's browsers and the Web application; in other words, breaching into the Web server through e.g. a buffer overflow may not be regarded as a compromise of the operating system proper, but it certainly constitutes a damaging exploit on the Web application.|$|E
500|$|Escapement, hydraulic-powered (use in clockworks): Although the {{escapement}} mechanism was first invented by the Greek Philon of Byzantium for a mechanical washstand, an {{escapement mechanism}} for clockworks was first {{developed by the}} Buddhist monk, court astronomer, mathematician and engineer Yi Xing (683–727) of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) for his water-powered celestial globe {{in the tradition of}} the Han dynasty polymath and inventor Zhang Heng (78–139), and could be found in later Chinese clockworks such as the clock towers developed by the military engineer Zhang Sixun (fl. late 10th century) and polymath inventor Su Song (1020–1101). Yi Xing's escapement allowed for a bell to be rung automatically every hour, and a drum beaten automatically every quarter-hour, essentially a striking clock. Unlike the modern escapement which employs a suspended oscillating pendulum resting and releasing its hooks on a small rotating gear wheel, the early Chinese escapement employed the use of gravity and hydraulics. In Su Song's clock tower, scoop containers fixed to the spokes of a vertical waterwheel (which acted like a gear wheel) would be filled one by one with siphoned water from a clepsydra tank. When the weight of the water in the scoop filled to an excess, it overcame a counterweight that in turn tripped a lever allowing the scoop to rotate on a pivot and drain its water. However, as the scoop fell, it tripped a coupling tongue that temporarily pulled down on a long vertical chain, the latter yanking down on a balancing lever which would pull upward on a small chain connected to a locking arm, the latter lifting momentarily to release the top arrested spoke before coming back down to repeat the entire process over again. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the Chinese intermittently working liquid-driven escapement had [...] "only the name in common" [...] with the true mechanical escapement of medieval European mechanical clocks of the 14th century onwards, which worked instead with weights, producing continuous but discrete beats and that derived from the Greek and Roman verge mechanism (alarum) [...] device of earlier mechanisms.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{proponent of}} the Imiaslavie {{doctrine}} was a Hieromonk of the Andreyevsky skete of Athos Mountain, Anthony Bulatovich, who published a few books on the subject.

2500|$|Water is {{the primary}} source of {{hydrogen}} to all living organisms, so the isotopic composition of environmental water is a first-order control on that of the biosphere. The hydrological cycle moves water around different reservoirs {{on the surface of the}} earth, during which hydrogen isotopes in water are significantly fractionated. [...] As the primary moisture source to the atmosphere, the ocean has a relatively uniform hydrogen isotope composition across the globe around 0‰ (VSMOW). Variations of δD larger than 10‰ in the ocean are generally confined to surface waters due to evaporation, sea ice formation, and addition of meteoric waters by precipitation, rivers or icebergs. In the hydrological cycle, the two major processes that fractionate hydrogen isotopes from ocean water are evaporation and condensation. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that oxygen isotopic composition (18O/16O) of water is also an important tracer in the hydrological cycle, and cannot be separated from hydrogen isotopes when we talk about isotope fractionation processes associated with water.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Gentlemen and Players" [...] {{distinction}} was {{a reflection}} of the higher status enjoyed by officers above other ranks in the British Army, and of employers above the workforce in commerce and industry. It therefore seemed natural to most 19th century English people, of all classes, to have a similar distinction in sport. This perception of amateurs as officers and gentlemen, and thereby leaders, meant that any team including an amateur would tend to appoint him as captain, even though most if not all of the professional players were more skilled technically. On occasion, as in the Yorkshire team of the 1920s, a ridiculous situation arose wherein the de facto captain was the senior professional (e.g., Wilfred Rhodes) and the nominal amateur captain [...] "did what he was told". The idea of amateur captains only was applied to Test cricket from 1888. Some English touring teams to Australia until then had been all-professional, having been launched as private ventures, but England did not appoint another professional captain until Len Hutton in 1952 though, in the 1930s, Wally Hammond switched status from professional to amateur so that he could captain his country. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that some of the amateur captains (e.g., W. G. Grace, Stanley Jackson, C. B. Fry and Peter May) were unquestionably worth their places in the England team on the grounds of their technical ability.|$|E
2500|$|The {{classical}} {{description of}} F-actin {{states that it}} has a filamentous structure that can be considered to be a single stranded levorotatory helix with a rotation of 166° around the helical axis and an axial translation of 27.5 Å, or a single stranded dextrorotatory helix with a cross over spacing of 350-380 Å, with each actin surrounded by four more. The symmetry of the actin polymer at 2.17 subunits per turn of a helix is incompatible with the formation of crystals, which is only possible with a symmetry of exactly 2, 3, 4 or 6 subunits per turn. Therefore, models have to be constructed that explain these anomalies using data from electron microscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, crystallization of dimers in different positions and diffraction of X-rays. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that it is not correct to talk of a “structure” for a molecule as dynamic as the actin filament. In reality we talk of distinct structural states, in these the measurement of axial translation remains constant at 27.5 Å while the subunit rotation data shows considerable variability, with displacements of up to 10% from its optimum position commonly seen. Some proteins, such as cofilin appear to increase the angle of turn, but again this could be interpreted as the establishment of different [...] "structural states". These could be important in the polymerization process.|$|E

2500|$|The Black Plague ravaged Europe {{during the}} 1340s-50s, wiping out {{almost half the}} continent's population. Particularly {{detrimental}} {{was the fact that}} most of the victims were young adults in their prime working years, which left behind an [...] "hourglass" [...] population structure comprised heavily of children and older people with fewer in-between. However, it should also be pointed out that the widespread belief of medieval Europe having a [...] "pyramid" [...] population where most people were under 45 was not completely true and in fact varied widely from region to region. France traditionally had high birth rates, but Italy's fertility was lower to begin with and especially after the Plague had ravaged the region, many cities such as Florence, Verona, and Arezzo had populations where more than 15% of people were over the age of 60. Since overall life expectancy in Europe did not increase by any significant margin during this period, the aging cohort in some areas can be almost completely blamed on the effects of the Plague. Finally, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that wealthy households had larger numbers of children than the poor. For example, in the early 15th century, the average age of Florence's population among the lower classes was 25 while the upper classes had an average age of just 17. The countryside became swiftly depopulated after the Plague as well due to surviving young people moving en masse to the cities.|$|E
2500|$|With {{regards to}} the Italian Social Republic casualties, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the Ufficio dell'Albo d'Oro {{excludes}} from its lists of the fallen the individuals who committed war crimes. In {{the context of the}} RSI, where numerous war crimes were committed in the anti-partisan warfare, and many individuals were therefore involved in such crimes (especially GNR and Black Brigades personnel), this influences negatively the casualty count, under a statistical point of view. The [...] "RSI Historical Foundation" [...] (Fondazione RSI Istituto Storico) has drafted [...] during and immediately after World War II (including the [...] "revenge killings" [...] that occurred {{at the end of the}} hostilities and in their immediate aftermath), including some 13,500 members of the Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana and Milizia Difesa Territoriale, 6,200 members of the Black Brigades, 2,800 Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana personnel, 1,000 Marina Nazionale Repubblicana personnel, 1,900 X MAS personnel, 800 soldiers of the [...] "Monterosa" [...] Division, 470 soldiers of the [...] "Italia" [...] Division, 1,500 soldiers of the [...] "San Marco" [...] Division, 300 soldiers of the [...] "Littorio" [...] Division, 350 soldiers of the [...] "Tagliamento" [...] Alpini Regiment, 730 soldiers of the 3rd and 8th Bersaglieri regiments, 4,000 troops of miscellaneous units of the Esercito Nazionale Repubblicano (excluding the aabove-mentioned Divisions and Alpini and Bersaglieri Regiments), 300 members of the Legione Autonoma Mobile [...] "Ettore Muti", 200 members of the Raggruppamento Anti Partigiani, 550 members of the Italian SS, and 170 members of the Cacciatori degli Appennini Regiment.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 August 1914, {{less than}} three weeks after the start of World War I, the Café Piccadilly was given a new name– the more patriotic-sounding Café Vaterland. However, in 1927–8 the {{architect}} and entrepreneur Carl Stahl-Urach (1879–1933) transformed the whole building into a gastronomic fantasy land, financed and further elaborated upon by new owners the Kempinski organisation. It reopened on 31 August 1928 as the Haus Vaterland, offering [...] "The World in One House," [...] and could now hold up to 8,000 guests at a time. The Café Vaterland had remained largely untouched, but the 1,200-seat theatre was now a 1,400-seat cinema. The rest of the building had been turned into a large number of theme restaurants, all served from a central kitchen containing the largest gas-fuelled cooking plant in Europe. These included: Rheinterrasse, Löwenbräu (Bavarian beer restaurant), Grinzing (Viennese café and wine bar), Bodega (Spanish winery), Csarda (Hungarian), Wild West Bar (aka the Arizona Bar) (American), Osteria (Italian), Kombüse (Bremen drinking den– literally [...] "galley"), Rübchen (Teltow, named after the well-known turnip dish Teltower Rübchen, made with turnips grown locally {{in the small town of}} Teltow just outside Berlin), plus a Turkish cafe and Japanese tearoom; additionally there was a large ballroom. Up to eight orchestras and dance bands regularly performed in different parts of the building, plus a host of singers, dancers and other entertainers. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> here though that not all of these attractions existed simultaneously, owing to changes in those countries that Germany was or was not allied to, in the volatile years leading up to and during World War II, a good example being the closure of the Wild West Bar following America's entry into the war as an enemy of Germany.|$|E
30|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>pointed</b> that {{according}} to Garvie's[8, 9, 10] studies, the smaller size particles of the t-ZrO 2 phase are more stable at room temperature because of their larger specific surface area. This statement is in a good agreement with the results obtained from Table 1.

60|$|And {{now we must}} go back to Desmond Court, and see {{under what}} all but {{overwhelming}} difficulties poor Clara wrote her affectionate letter. And {{in the first place}} <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> how very wrong Herbert had been in going to Desmond Court on foot, through the mud and rain. A man can hardly bear himself nobly unless his outer aspect be in some degree noble. It may be very sad, this having to admit that the tailor does in great part make the man; but such I fear is undoubtedly the fact. Could the Chancellor look dignified on the woolsack, if he had had an accident with his wig, or allowed his robes to be torn or soiled? Does not half the piety of a bishop reside in his lawn sleeves, and all his meekness in his anti-virile apron? Had Herbert understood the world he would have had out the best pair of horses standing in the Castle Richmond stables, when going to Desmond Court on such an errand. He would have brushed his hair, and anointed himself; he would have clothed himself in his rich Spanish cloak; he would have seen that his hat was brushed, and his boots spotless; and then with all due solemnity but with head erect, he would have told his tale out boldly. The countess would still have wished to be rid of him, hearing that he was a pauper; but she would have lacked the courage to turn him from the house as she had done.|$|E
30|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>pointed</b> that, in both strategies, {{equalizing}} QoE across services {{does not}} necessarily increase the overall QoE.
