5|$|At birth {{the lungs}} are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli {{of the adult}} lung present. The alveoli {{continue}} to form into <b>early</b> <b>adulthood,</b> {{and their ability to}} form when necessary is seen in the regeneration of the lung. Alveolar septa have a double capillary network instead of the single network of the developed lung. Only after the maturation of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E

25|$|The biological/maturational account {{suggests}} that genetic fitness is improved by having many memories that {{fall within the}} reminiscence bump. Cognitive capacities are at their optimum from the ages of 10 to 30 and the reminiscence bump may reflect a peak in cognitive performance.

Researchers {{have suggested that the}} increase of cognitive ability in <b>early</b> <b>adulthood</b> may cause memories during this time period to be more adequately stored (Ece & Gulgoz, 2014). The reminiscence bump is caused by age-related differences in encoding efficiency, which cause more memories to be stored in adolescence and <b>early</b> <b>adulthood.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{a growing}} {{literature}} documenting socioeconomic inequalities in obesity risk among adults in the UK, with poorer groups suffering higher risk. Methods In this systematic review, we summarize and appraise the extant peer-reviewed literature about socioeconomic inequalities in adult obesity risk in the UK published between 1980 and 2010. Only studies featuring empirical assessments of relations between socioeconomic indicators and measures of obesity among adults in the UK were included. Results A total of 35 articles met inclusion criteria, and were reviewed here. Conclusion Socioeconomic indicators of low socioeconomic position (SEP), including occupational social class of the head-of-household at birth and during childhood, <b>earlier</b> <b>adulthood</b> occupational social class, contemporaneous occupational social class, educational attainment, and area-level deprivation were generally inversely associated with adult obesity risk in the UK. Measures of SEP were more predictive of obesity among women than among men. We outline important methodological limitations to the literature and recommend avenues for future research. </p...|$|R

40|$|Keeping {{elephants}} in zoos is extremely costly, yet does not yield self-sustaining 16 populations. In Europe, which holds c. half the global zoo elephant population, a long 17 term decline of c. 10 % per year {{is expected in}} both species, if reliant on zoo-bred animals 18 under historically prevailing conditions. Fitness in zoos is compromised in several ways. 19 Compared with protected in situ populations (Burmese working Asians; Kenyan free 20 living Africans), zoo elephants show premature reproductive senescence and [...] despite 21 improving adult survivorship for Africans [...] die <b>earlier</b> in <b>adulthood</b> than expected. In 22 Asian elephants, infant survivorship in zoos is also greatly reduced relative to Burmese 23 elephants, and furthermore, zoo-born animals die <b>earlier</b> in <b>adulthood</b> than wild-caught 24 conspecifics kept in zoos, via effects ‘programmed’ peri-natally. In this species, being 25 transferred between zoos also increases mortality rates. Both survival and fecundity 26 would need to improve to attain self-sustaining zoo populations. Our findings 27 demonstrate deficits in zoo elephant management, particularly for Asians, and implicate 28 stress and obesity as likely problems...|$|R

40|$|Drawing from {{concepts}} in criminological literature and sociological life-course perspective literature, data from adolescent and young adult measurements collected {{as part of}} a longitudinal panel study conducted on a cohort from Harris County, Texas, were used to estimate Structural Equation Models, testing the unmediated and mediated relationships between adolescent deviance, early timing of transitions to adult roles, and adult deviance. First, a simplified three latent variable model was estimated using the full sample (N= 3, 379) to examine direct associations among adolescent deviance, <b>early</b> transitions to <b>adulthood,</b> and adult deviance while controlling for prior involvement in deviant behavior in adolescence. An expanded seven latent variable model was then estimated adding mechanisms in adolescence through which the relationships previously observed in the simplified model are mediated. Lastly, both the simplified and expanded models were estimated on eight subgroups in the sample to examine whether the relationships observed for the full sample are moderated by gender, race/ethnicity, paternal level of education, and expectations for future failure in conventional adolescent roles. For the full sample, the simplified model produced significant direct relationshipsbetween adolescent deviance and <b>early</b> transitions to <b>adulthood,</b> and between <b>early</b> transitions to <b>adulthood</b> and adult deviance. When this simplified model was estimated on the eight subgroups, the first relationship remained stable for each of the eight moderating subgroups, while the second relationship did not. When several intervening variables were added between adolescent deviance and <b>early</b> transitions to <b>adulthood</b> in the expanded model, the parameters added to the model using the intervening variables formed a chain of significant direct relationships fully mediating the relationship between adolescent deviance and <b>early</b> transitions to <b>adulthood</b> for the full sample. This chain of significant direct relationships remained stable for five of the eight subgroups, and the three subgroups that did not experience full mediation underwent great attenuation of the relationship. These intervening variables offer avenues for altering the trajectory of behavior seen in the simplified model...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY This study {{aimed to}} assess, whether {{depression}} in adulthood {{was associated with}} self-reported chewing difficulties at older age, and examine whether {{the strength of the}} association differed according to the number of depression episodes in earlier adult life. We used Whitehall II study data from 277 participants who completed a questionnaire in 2011. Depression was measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) in 2003 and 2008. The association between CES-D depression and self-reported chewing ability was assessed using regression models adjusted for some socio-demographic factors. Participants with depression {{at some point in their}} <b>earlier</b> <b>adulthood</b> had an odds ratio (95 % CI) of 201 (106, 382) for reporting chewing difficulties in older adulthood, compared to those without depression. The respective odds ratios were 142 (066, 304) for individuals with depression in only one phase, but 353 (151, 824) for those with depression in two phases. In conclusion, while further research is required, there was an association between depression and chewing difficulty that was independent of demographic and socio-economic characteristics. Furthermore, this increased odds for chewing difficulties was primarily among adults that experienced two episodes or a prolonged period of depression...|$|R
