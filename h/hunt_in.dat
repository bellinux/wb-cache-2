5|$|Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic. Juveniles stay {{in water}} and on {{adjacent}} coast, but adults are able to move further inland and spend half their time on land and half in the ocean. Adult males are more terrestrially active during mating and <b>hunt</b> <b>in</b> shallower water, requiring more terrestrial locomotive ability. On the other hand, adult females are less active on land during mating and <b>hunt</b> <b>in</b> deeper water, requiring more aquatic locomotive ability. Because males are smaller, they crawl and swim faster than females.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat small fish. Males and females exhibit sexual dimorphism in hunting behavior, as adult females, which are significantly larger than males, prefer to <b>hunt</b> <b>in</b> deeper water for larger conger eels, while adult males <b>hunt</b> <b>in</b> shallower water for smaller moray eels. In addition, females hunt {{for only one}} prey item per foraging bout, while males often hunt for multiple items. After hunting, the banded sea kraits return to land in order to digest their prey.|$|E

5|$|Monodontids {{consist of}} two species: the beluga and the narwhal. They both {{reside in the}} frigid arctic and both have large amounts of blubber. Belugas, being white, <b>hunt</b> <b>in</b> large pods near the surface and around pack ice, their {{coloration}} acting as camouflage. Narwhals, being black, <b>hunt</b> <b>in</b> large pods in the aphotic zone, but their underbelly still remains white to remain camouflaged when something is looking directly up or down at them. They have no dorsal fin to prevent collision with pack ice.|$|E

5|$|Many sharks, {{including}} the whitetip reef shark are cooperative feeders and <b>hunt</b> <b>in</b> packs to herd and capture elusive prey.

5|$|This serpent eagle {{feeds on}} snakes, chameleons, and toads, and hunts these species by {{dropping}} onto {{them from a}} perch in the understory.

The Congo serpent eagle is listed as a species of Least Concern due to its large range and population. This species has been kept as a pet.|$|E
5|$|Written by Neil Penswick, {{this was}} a three-part futuristic thriller in which a group of {{soldiers}} are hunting down two shape-changing criminals called Butler and Swarfe.

5|$|A monohedral tiling is a {{tessellation}} {{in which}} all tiles are congruent; it has only one prototile. A particularly interesting type of monohedral tessellation is the spiral monohedral tiling. The first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936; the Voderberg tiling has a unit tile that is a nonconvex enneagon. The Hirschhorn tiling, published by Michael D. Hirschhorn and D. C. <b>Hunt</b> <b>in</b> 1985, is a pentagon tiling using irregular pentagons: regular pentagons cannot tile the Euclidean plane as the internal angle of a regular pentagon, , is not a divisor of 2.|$|E

After months of clashes with the squatters, the Sauks left in September 1829 for the next winter hunt.

5|$|In the 1110s, Beauchamp became Sheriff of Worcestershire, {{holding the}} office until 1130. Some sources state he {{received}} the office in 1114, and others place the acquisition of the office between December 1113 and April 1116. Beauchamp inherited most of d'Abetot's lands and the hereditary office of Sheriff of Worcestershire when Roger d'Abetot, Urse's son, forfeited his lands and offices after being exiled by Henry I for murder. King Henry I of England granted Beauchamp the right to hunt wolves and foxes in the royal forests of Worcestershire. Along {{with the right to}} <b>hunt</b> <b>in</b> the royal forests came a grant of the right to keep pheasants on his own lands, and the right to fine anyone hunting the birds without his permission.|$|E
5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators, {{meaning that they}} {{themselves}} have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because they <b>hunt</b> <b>in</b> groups like wolf packs. Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, sea birds and sea turtles. However, different populations or ecotypes may specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species. Specialization of prey species may be more common in whales that inhabit temperate areas due to higher food productivity.|$|E

She was buried in the cathedral of Várad (now Oradea in Romania). Mary's sister, Jadwiga, claimed the crown, but Sigismund retained it without much difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all mammals are {{endothermic}} ("warm-blooded"). Most mammals {{also have}} hair {{to help keep}} them warm. Like birds, mammals can forage or <b>hunt</b> <b>in</b> weather and climates too cold for ectothermic ("cold-blooded") reptiles and insects. Endothermy requires plenty of food energy, so mammals eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles. Small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size. A rare exception, the naked mole-rat produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational poikilotherm. Birds are also endothermic, so endothermy {{is not unique to}} mammals.|$|E
5|$|One new {{innovation}} {{that took place}} during the campaign was renewed interest in personnel infiltration. This aspect of the PAVN effort had been virtually ignored since the initiation of the Commando <b>Hunt</b> <b>in</b> 1968. An intelligence collection and technical reassessment effort invited the Air Force to make another attempt to force the North Vietnamese pay for their effort in blood instead of in imported supplies and trucks. The result was Island Tree the launching of a personnel anti-infiltration effort during Commando Hunt VII. However, it was too little and far too late.|$|E
