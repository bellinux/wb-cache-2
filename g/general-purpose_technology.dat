He believes that the current technological landscape would look very different in the absence of military and defense-related contributions to commercial technology development.

40|$|This {{empirical}} paper analyses {{the importance}} of information and communications technologies (ICT) in the technological diversification trend among the world's large industrial firms. The objective of the research is twofold. First, to emphasise the emerging differences among technologies when companies from different industries patent outside their traditional technological competencies. Second, to investigate whether the tendency among large companies from all industries to patent in ICT is distinctive when compared with other technologies. We find that technological diversification in large companies has certainly occurred in ICTs. For other technologies the results are ambiguous. As could be expected there is considerable industry variation in the intensity and specific directions of ICT patenting. We conclude {{that the development of}} corporate capabilities in the key technologies of the emerging ICT paradigm is more widespread than previously emphasised in the literature. One implication is that the rise of multi-technology corporations can be related to the concept of long waves of techno-economic change and to studies characterising ICT as a <b>general-purpose</b> <b>technology.</b> ICT, technological diversification, patents, corporate capabilities, long waves...|$|E

40|$|The {{possible}} {{existence of}} long waves in economic time series {{has long been}} an important subject of debate for economists, statisticians and historians. Recent empirical evidence for these long-term fluctuations is found in the literature of structural time series models. One empirical method for detecting long waves which seems to be particularly compatible with their theoretical explanation is the band pass filter. Applying the band pass filter to data from six European countries demonstrates the presence of wave-like fluctuations with a length of between 30 and 50 years. Their turning points show quite strong similarities across the six countries examined. Moreover, there is evidence for a stable lead-lag structure for two countries. The dominant theoretical explanation for long waves stresses the diffusion of general-purpose technologies. The diffusion of the railway system as one example of a <b>general-purpose</b> <b>technology</b> was analysed by means of logistic regression. The results are quite striking, as there seems to be evidence for a temporal sequence, implying that the turning points of railway diffusion occurred before the turning points of long waves.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} the need to {{understand}} how mobile technology is implemented and used at the organisational level. IT is a <b>general-purpose</b> <b>technology</b> and therefore its use involves a high degree of uncertainty and ambiguity. Moreover, IT vendors and system developers tend to be very unambiguous in their rhetoric about mobile technology opportunities. Therefore, managers have trouble to identify the real scope, the functionality and the impact of new mobile applications. However, these three types of uncertainties need to be handled in change management projects where new information technology is involved. Gradual uncertainty reduction at these three different levels, i. e. what technology can do; will technology work; and will users adopt it, is studied in this paper. This is achieved through an analysis of the implementation process of an information system where mobile terminals are used to give service technicians access to the ERP system at BT Europe, a leading supplier of forklift trucks. The analysis shows how the three levels of uncertainty interact, and how the computerised parts of the information system are complemented by mindful intertwining with the non-computerised communication and manual data processing, in order for the information system to work...|$|E

While a five-year period is too short to render convincing evidence of a New Economy – there have been earlier periods with higher productivity growth than in the late 1990 s – there are several indicators that something different happened during the U. S. business expansion in the 1990 s compared to those in the 1960 s and 1980 s.

40|$|Digitization {{has reached}} things. This shift {{promises}} {{to alter the}} business and legal landscape {{for a range of}} industries. Digitization has already disrupted copyright-based industries and laws. As cost barriers dropped, individuals engaged with copyrighted work as never before. The business-to-business models of industrial copyright faltered and in some cases failed. Industries had to reorganize, and claimed foundations for copyright had to be re-examined. This Article examines a prime example the next phase of digitization: 3 D printing and it implications on intellectual property law and practice. 3 D printing is a <b>general-purpose</b> <b>technology</b> that will do for physical objects what MP 3 files did for music. The core patent bargain — sharing the plans on how to make something in exchange for exclusivity — may be meaningless in a world of digitized things. While these devices will unleash the creativity of producers and reduce costs for consumers, they will also make it far easier to infringe patents, copyrights, and trade dress. This will force firms to rethink their business practices and courts to reexamine not only patent doctrine but also long established doctrine in areas ranging from copyright merger to trademark post-sale confusion. Moreover, Congress will need to consider establishing some sort of infringement exemption for 3 D printing in the home and expanding the notice-and takedown provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to websites that host software enabling the 3 D printing of patented items and distinctive trade dress.

40|$|The {{labour market}} {{position}} of low skilled workers has deteriorated {{dramatically over the}} 80 s and early 90 s. A well-known manifestation of this deterioration is the rise in relative high-skilled wages observed in the United States. It is a well-documented fact that demand shifts underlie this deterioration and several studies indicate that technical change is a likely candidate to explain such relative demand shifts. It is, however, still not very well understood why technological change would be biased persistently against low skilled workers when their relative labour costs are dropping. Modern economics considers technological change to be endogenous {{and the result of}} rational decisions taken by economically constrained agents. This paper presents a model that provides two possible answers to this puzzle. The bias can be caused by the deliberate development of skilled labour complementary technologies under certain conditions. If these conditions are met, the bias and the resulting labour demand shift is a permanent one and so are the consequences for relative wages and employment levels. A slightly different specification with more realistic assumptions, however, can still explain the observed shift in demand. When I assume that the production of new products is inherently skill biased because uncertainty is high and flexibility required in the initial stages of the product life cycle, then the model can generate the shift in response to the introduction of a new <b>general-purpose</b> <b>technology,</b> for example the IT- revolution. Once new products mature and process innovations are made can low skilled workers be involved in the production of such products. As such the model introduces some old ideas into a new debate. ...|$|E

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), {{is a new}} information paradigm based on the collaboration {{of a large number}} of self-organized sensing nodes. With the increasing demand of cyber-physical interaction, wireless sensor networks have emerged as one of key technologies for many promising applications such as assisted living, military surveillance, infrastructure protection and scientific exploration. Sensor networks are acclaimed to be low-cost, low-profile, and easy to deploy. These attractive advantages, however, imply the resources available to individual nodes are severely limited. Although it is highly possible that the constraints on computation and storage disappear along with the fast development of fabrication techniques, the energy constraint is unlikely to fade away quickly. On the other hand, many sensor network based applications require a lifetime that ranges from several months to tens of years. In order to bridge the gap between limited energy supply and long-term operation requirement of applications, we then have to build extremely low duty-cycle sensor networks where during the operation of sensor applications, sensor nodes activate very briefly and stay in a dormant state for a very long period of time. In this dissertation research, we initiate the first systematic research for low-duty-cycle sensor networks, including a generic sensing architecture, a novel data forwarding scheme for intermittently connected networks and an energy synchronized communication middleware for energy-harvesting sensor networks. The goal of this dissertation research is to provide better understanding of how to build practical and efficient extremely low duty-cycle sensor networks and support those long-term applications such as structure monitoring, traffic control and so on. We hope, toward the very end, this dissertation research can assist the transition of sensor network technology from a research concept to a <b>general-purpose</b> <b>technology</b> available for use for a wide variety of research, government and industry purposes...|$|E

Another line is to stress the interrelated changes in technology, organisation and consumption that came up in the last decade of the twentieth century. Paul Geroski offers a third definition which is very nice and easy: he defines the New Economy by the existence of two sectors; for him, "New Economy " is information and communication technology (ICT) plus life sciences.
