30|$|Another common {{concern about}} the laparoscopic {{treatment}} of diffuse peritonitis is the efficacy and safety of the peritoneal lavage and toilette. However, from {{the first introduction of}} the technique better <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>Laparoscopic</b> Lavage more than 15  years ago (O’Sullivan et al. 1996), several experiences in the literature confirmed its efficacy in achieving an effective wash out of diffuse peritonitis, even with better results than open surgery if performed by experienced operator (Favuzza et al. 2009; Karoui et al. 2009), since it allows the surgeons to reach the most hidden and deep spaces of the abdominal quadrants (Myers et al. 2008).|$|R
25|$|Groin hernias that do {{not cause}} {{symptoms}} in males {{do not need to}} be repaired. Repair, however, is generally recommended in women due to the higher rate of femoral hernias which have more complications. If strangulation occurs immediate surgery is required. Repair may be done by open surgery or by laparoscopic surgery. Open surgery has the benefit of possibly being done under local anesthesia rather than general anesthesia. Laparoscopic surgery generally has less pain following the procedure. A hiatus hernia may be treated with lifestyle changes such as raising the head of the bed, weight loss, and adjusting eating habits. The medications, H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors may help. If the symptoms do not improve with medications the surgery <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>laparoscopic</b> fundoplication may be an option.|$|R
50|$|Medical {{treatment}} advanced {{during these}} years. The use of lasers and computers became {{important parts of}} medical treatment. Computers were essential {{in the development of}} new medical imaging devices such as the CAT scan, positron emission tomography and the MRI. Minimally invasive surgery, also <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>laparoscopic</b> surgery, reduced surgical damage to patients. Lasers were used with catheters for clearing blocked arteries and catheters with small cameras provided images of conditions inside the body. Coronary bypass surgery became commonplace. Laser eye surgery became popular in the 1990s and was used to improve visual acuity for the near-sighted. New chemical chemotherapy combinations helped prolong the lives of cancer patients. Techniques for the long-term application of medication {{through the use of a}} skin patch or implants appeared during these years.|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of 3 D computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) is of considerable interest {{because it can}} potentially improve many minimally invasive procedures such <b>as</b> robot-assisted <b>laparoscopic</b> partial <b>nephrectomy.</b> Partial nephrectomy patients often receive preoperative CT angiography for diagnosis. The 3 D CT image is of high quality and has a large field of view. Intraoperatively, dynamic real-time images are acquired using ultrasound. While US is real-time and safe for frequent imaging, the images captured are noisy and only provide a limited perspective. Providing accurate registration between the two modalities would enhance navigation and image guidance for the surgeon because it can bring the pre-operative CT into a current view of the patient provided by US. The challenging aspect of this registration problem is that US and CT produce very different images. Thus, a recurring strategy is to use pre-processing techniques to highlight the similar elements between the images...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} results of retroperitoneal <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>nephrectomy</b> at a single centre.

40|$|The laparoscopic {{approach}} has been established as the surgical procedure of choice for radical nephrectomy during the recent years. The advantages of the <b>laparoscopic</b> radical <b>nephrectomy</b> {{in comparison to the}} open approach are well-documented. The oncological results of the laparoscopic approach are similar to the open procedure while the post-operative morbidity is lower. <b>Laparoscopic</b> partial <b>nephrectomy</b> seems to gain ground to its open counterpart, as the accumulation of experience in the technique grows. In this review, a PubMed search in the latest literature on radical and partial <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>nephrectomy</b> took place and the outcome of the search is presented.
