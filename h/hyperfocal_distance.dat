25|$|The <b>hyperfocal</b> <b>{{distance}}</b> is {{the nearest}} focus distance {{at which the}} DOF extends to infinity; focusing the camera at the <b>hyperfocal</b> <b>distance</b> results in the largest possible depth of field for a given f-number (Ray 2000, 55). Focusing beyond the <b>hyperfocal</b> <b>distance</b> does not increase the far DOF (which already extends to infinity), but it does decrease the DOF {{in front of the}} subject, decreasing the total DOF. Some photographers consider this wasting DOF; however, see Object field methods above for a rationale for doing so. Focusing on the <b>hyperfocal</b> <b>distance</b> is a special case of zone focusing in which the far limit of DOF is at infinity.|$|E
25|$|Some cameras {{have their}} <b>hyperfocal</b> <b>distance</b> {{marked on the}} focus dial. For example, on the Minox LX {{focusing}} dial there is a red dot between 2 m and infinity; when the lens is set at the red dot, that is, focused at the <b>hyperfocal</b> <b>distance,</b> the depth of field stretches from 2 m to infinity.|$|E
25|$|If {{the lens}} {{includes}} a DOF scale, the <b>hyperfocal</b> <b>distance</b> {{can be set}} by aligning the infinity mark on the distance scale with the mark on the DOF scale corresponding to the f-number to which the lens is set. For example, with the 35mm lens shown above set to f/11, aligning the infinity mark with the '11' {{to the left of}} the index mark on the DOF scale would set the focus to the <b>hyperfocal</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E
25|$|The DOF {{beyond the}} subject is always greater than the DOF {{in front of the}} subject. When {{the subject is}} at the <b>hyperfocal</b> <b>{{distance}}</b> or beyond, the far DOF is infinite, so the ratio is 1:âˆž; as the subject distance decreases, near:far DOF ratio increases, approaching unity at high magnification. For large apertures at typical portrait distances, the ratio is still close to 1:1. The oft-cited rule that 1/3 of the DOF is in front of the subject and 2/3 is beyond (a 1:2 ratio) is true only when the subject distance is 1/3 the <b>hyperfocal</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E
25|$|As subject {{distance}} is decreased, the subject magnification increases, and eventually becomes large {{in comparison with}} the hyperfocal magnification. Thus the effect of focal length is greatest near the <b>hyperfocal</b> <b>distance,</b> and decreases as {{subject distance}} is decreased. However, the near/far perspective will differ for different focal lengths, so the difference in DOF may not be readily apparent.|$|E
25|$|Traditional depth-of-field {{formulas}} {{and tables}} assume equal circles of confusion for {{near and far}} objects. Some authors, such as Merklinger (1992), have suggested that distant objects often need to be much sharper to be clearly recognizable, whereas closer objects, being larger on the film, {{do not need to}} be so sharp. The loss of detail in distant objects may be particularly noticeable with extreme enlargements. Achieving this additional sharpness in distant objects usually requires focusing beyond the <b>hyperfocal</b> <b>distance,</b> sometimes almost at infinity. For example, if photographing a cityscape with a traffic bollard in the foreground, this approach, termed the object field method by Merklinger, would recommend focusing very close to infinity, and stopping down to make the bollard sharp enough. With this approach, foreground objects cannot always be made perfectly sharp, but the loss of sharpness in near objects may be acceptable if recognizability of distant objects is paramount.|$|E

Though commonly used when comparing formats, the approximation is valid only when the subject distance is large {{in comparison with the}} focal length of the larger format and small in comparison with the <b>hyperfocal</b> <b>distance</b> of the smaller format.|$|E
