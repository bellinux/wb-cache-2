25|$|Clutter is {{detected}} and neutralized in several ways. Clutter tends to appear static between radar scans; on subsequent scan echoes, desirable targets will appear to move, and all stationary echoes can be eliminated. Sea clutter {{can be reduced}} by using <b>horizontal</b> <b>polarization,</b> while rain is reduced with circular polarization (note that meteorological radars wish for the opposite effect, and therefore use linear polarization to detect precipitation). Other methods attempt to increase the signal-to-clutter ratio.|$|E
25|$|Especially {{due to the}} {{presence}} of the ground, there are some differences in propagation (and also in reflections responsible for TV ghosting) between horizontal and vertical polarizations. AM and FM broadcast radio usually use vertical polarization, while television uses <b>horizontal</b> <b>polarization.</b> At low frequencies especially, <b>horizontal</b> <b>polarization</b> is avoided. That is because the phase of a horizontally polarized wave is reversed upon reflection by the ground. A distant station in the horizontal direction will receive both the direct and reflected wave, which thus tend to cancel each other. This problem is avoided with vertical polarization. Polarization is also important in the transmission of radar pulses and reception of radar reflections by the same or a different antenna. For instance, back scattering of radar pulses by rain drops can be avoided by using circular polarization. Just as specular reflection of circularly polarized light reverses the handedness of the polarization, as discussed above, the same principle applies to scattering by objects much smaller than a wavelength such as rain drops. On the other hand, reflection of that wave by an irregular metal object (such as an airplane) will typically introduce a change in polarization and (partial) reception of the return wave by the same antenna.|$|E
25|$|The scheme {{relies on}} two {{properties}} of entanglement. First, the entangled states are perfectly correlated {{in the sense}} that if Alice and Bob both measure whether their particles have vertical or horizontal polarizations, they always get the same answer with 100% probability. The same is true if they both measure any other pair of complementary (orthogonal) polarizations. This necessitates that the two distant parties have exact directionality synchronization. However, the particular results are completely random; it is impossible for Alice to predict if she (and thus Bob) will get vertical polarization or <b>horizontal</b> <b>polarization.</b> Second, any attempt at eavesdropping by Eve destroys these correlations in a way that Alice and Bob can detect.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} free {{electrons}} in the ionosphere, {{in conjunction with}} the earth's magnetic field, causes Faraday rotation, a sort of circular birefringence. This is the same mechanism which can rotate the axis of linear polarization by electrons in interstellar space as mentioned below. The magnitude of Faraday rotation caused by such a plasma is greatly exaggerated at lower frequencies, so at the higher microwave frequencies used by satellites the effect is minimal. However medium or short wave transmissions received following refraction by the ionosphere are strongly affected. Since a wave's path through the ionosphere and the earth's magnetic field vector along such a path are rather unpredictable, a wave transmitted with vertical (or <b>horizontal)</b> <b>polarization</b> will generally have a resulting polarization in an arbitrary orientation at the receiver.|$|E
25|$|Rain {{scattering}} {{is purely}} a microwave propagation mode and is best observed around 10GHz, but extends {{down to a}} few gigahertz—the limit being {{the size of the}} scattering particle size vs. wavelength. This mode scatters signals mostly forwards and backwards when using <b>horizontal</b> <b>polarization</b> and side-scattering with vertical polarization. Forward-scattering typically yields propagation ranges of 800km. Scattering from snowflakes and ice pellets also occurs, but scattering from ice without watery surface is less effective. The most common application for this phenomenon is microwave rain radar, but rain scatter propagation can be a nuisance causing unwanted signals to intermittently propagate where they are not anticipated or desired. Similar reflections may also occur from insects though at lower altitudes and shorter range. Rain also causes attenuation of point-to-point and satellite microwave links. Attenuation values up to 30dB have been observed on 30GHz during heavy tropical rain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Traditional {{polarization}} diversity systems have re-lied {{on the distribution}} of obstacles within the mobile medium to achieve signal decorrelation and power coupling between or-thogonal polarizations. If the channel does not facilitate adequate power coupling, signal diversity is suboptimal because signal contribution from the polarization with lesser power is limited. Further, due to the presence of a dominant polarization, the signal power received in the orthogonal polarizations becomes a function of the transmitter orientation. The use of circular polarization at the transmitter is proposed to facilitate power coupling and alleviate the branch power imbalance between the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>polarizations.</b> The analysis shows that if circular polarization is used, the branch power im-balance between the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>polarizations</b> can be significantly lower than linear polarization, and that the cross polarization discrimination becomes independent of the transmitter orientation.

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{classical}} (analog) television transmissions are usually horizontally polarized, because {{in urban areas}} buildings can reflect the electromagnetic waves and create ghost images due to multipath propagation. Using <b>horizontal</b> <b>polarization,</b> ghosting is reduced because the amount of reflection of electromagnetic waves in the p polarization (<b>horizontal</b> <b>polarization</b> {{off the side of}} a building) is generally less than s (vertical, in this case) polarization.
