Although Wilson does not usually talk to cast members beforehand, {{it was the first}} time she became aware of the research and advice behind a storyline, and felt that the advice she was given was useful in staging the scenes. It was also based on real life instances, something that Brenton considered a hallmark of the series, as many episodes are based on such events. News stories detailing similar instances to the plot came out sometime after the episode's broadcast, and the producers believed it justified the episode. The ending was written to be melancholic, in which there were no winners.|$|E

Gielgud wrote in 1983, [...] "Besides cherishing our long years of work together in the theatre, where he was such an inspiring and generous partner, I grew to love him in private life as a great gentleman, a rare spirit, <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> <b>balanced,</b> devotedly loyal and tolerant and, as a companion, bursting with vitality, curiosity and humour." [...] Among Richardson's other parts in his first Old Vic season, Enobarbus in Antony and Cleopatra gained particularly good notices. The Morning Post commented that it placed him in the first rank of Shakespearean actors. At the beginning of 1931 Baylis re-opened Sadler's Wells Theatre with a production of Twelfth Night starring Gielgud as Malvolio and Richardson as Sir Toby Belch. W. A. Darlington in The Daily Telegraph wrote of Richardson's [...] "ripe, rich and mellow Sir Toby, [...] I would go many miles to see again." ...|$|E

Out of 370 {{million people in the}} U. S., 11. 1 million are illegal immigrants. These people have either entered the country illegally, or entered the country legally, but stayed beyond their termination date. Illegal immigrants affect the United States in different areas, such as the economy, work force, public services, and crime rate. Some economists say that we benefit from them by keeping wages of low-skilled workers down. But, there are people who believe that they decrease job opportunities for Americans. Others say that these illegal immigrants use a lot of public services, but do not contribute to our society as much as American citizens. And some say that crime rates are high because of these illegal immigrants. However, these statements may not be true.
