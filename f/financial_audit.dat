25|$|The {{compliance}} {{component of}} a Single Audit covers the study and understanding (planning stage) {{as well as the}} testing and evaluation (exam stage) of the recipient with respect to federal assistance usage, operations and compliance with laws and regulations. The financial component is exactly like a <b>financial</b> <b>audit</b> of a non-federal entity which includes the audit of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Depending on the recipient, the Single Audit can be simple and straightforward, or it could be complex and troublesome. This is because there are millions of federal grants awarded each year to thousands of recipients, each with its own independent way of operating. Therefore, the Single Audit differs from recipient to recipient and from federal program to program.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{increasing}} role of <b>financial</b> <b>auditing</b> in the fight against government sector fraud and financial mismanagement in Ghana, Africa. Using a Foucauldian-inspired theoretical framing, the paper explores the growing cases of fraud in the Ghanaian public sector and the technologies of government that have been enlisted to combat it. The paper also discusses the particular interests that are likely served by the push for <b>financial</b> <b>audits</b> as the preferred weapon for fighting government sector fraud in the country. Design/methodology/approach – The approach of the paper is qualitative involving the use of a variety of archival material and interviews with employees of the Ghana Audit Service, the Controller and Accountant-General's Department, and global agencies like the World Bank and United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Findings – The paper finds that contrary to the view of “auditing as an alien phenomenon in most parts of the Third World, certainly Africa,” <b>financial</b> <b>auditing</b> is the preferred approach to fighting government sector fraud in Ghana. The paper also shows that <b>financial</b> <b>auditing</b> is privileged over other technologies of government, in this context, largely because it reinforces the hegemony of international development agencies like the World Bank and the imperialism of the big four accounting firms. Originality/value – The paper adds insight into the increasing role of <b>financial</b> <b>auditing</b> in the fight against government sector fraud and financial mismanagement in Ghana. <b>Auditing,</b> <b>Financial</b> reporting, Fraud, Ghana, Governance, Public sector organizations...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} {{study examines}} a material but less understood {{component of the}} public audit marketplace, namely the provision of “audit-related” services to <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> clients. I use the benefit plan audit service setting to examine the company and benefit plan characteristics associated with auditor selection {{and the impact of}} audit-related services on <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> quality. I provide market evidence of distinct shifts {{in the use of the}} same audit firm for the <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> and other audit-related services over time as well as characteristics of the choice of auditors. I then test whether having the same audit firm for both types of audit services is associated with <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> quality as measured by missed misstatements (revealed through future restatements). I find that companies that engage the same audit firm for their <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> and benefit plan audit are less likely to have subsequent restatements. I also test whether having the same audit firm for both types of audit services is associated with switching the <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> firm. I find that companies that engage the same audit firm for their <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> and benefit plan audit are associated with a lower likelihood of switching their <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> firm. Overall, my results suggest that choosing the same auditor for both the <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> and audit-related services is associated with a higher level of <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> quality consistent with knowledge spillover between the financial statement and benefit plan audits. My findings also suggests that who provides audit-related services, and whether or not that provider has changed, affects the perception of switching costs for the <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit...</b>|$|R
