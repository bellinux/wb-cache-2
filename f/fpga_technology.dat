5000|$|As {{commercial}} successors {{of governmental}} ASIC solutions have become available, {{also known as}} custom hardware attacks, two emerging technologies have proven their capability in the brute-force attack of certain ciphers. One is modern graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, {{the other is the}} field-programmable gate array (<b>FPGA)</b> <b>technology.</b> GPUs benefit from their wide availability and price-performance benefit, FPGAs from their energy efficiency per cryptographic operation. Both technologies try to transport the benefits of parallel processing to brute-force attacks. In case of GPUs some hundreds, in the case of FPGA some thousand processing units making them much better suited to cracking passwords than conventional processors.Various publications in the fields of cryptographic analysis have proved the energy efficiency of today’s <b>FPGA</b> <b>technology,</b> for example, the COPACOBANA FPGA Cluster computer consumes the same energy as a single PC (600 W), but performs like 2,500 PCs for certain algorithms. A number of firms provide hardware-based FPGA cryptographic analysis solutions from a single FPGA PCI Express card up to dedicated FPGA computers. WPA and WPA2 encryption have successfully been brute-force attacked by reducing the workload by a factor of 50 in comparison to conventional CPUs and some hundred in case of FPGAs.|$|E

In this paper we discuss the state-of-the-art in FPGA physical design. Compared to physical design in traditional ASICs, FPGAs pose a different set of requirements and challenges. Consequently the algorithms in FPGA physical design have evolved differently from their ASIC counterparts. Apart from allowing FPGA users to implement their designs on FPGAs, FPGA physical design is also used extensively in developing and evaluating new FPGA architectures. Finally, the future of FPGA physical design is discussed along with how it is interacting with the latest <b>FPGA</b> <b>technologies...</b>|$|R

The system underwent further development resulting in an producing an exemplar which is web accessible and which can cope in near real time with groups (e.g. hawk moths) which contain several hundred taxa. On medium to high end PC server hardware (e.g. a blade server) an identification is possible in under a second for a 300 taxon group. Parallelisation of the critical Daisy classifier codes (using either bespoke <b>FPGA</b> <b>technology</b> or general purpose GPU programming technology such as CUDA) will give an order of magnitude increase in performance. This means that Daisy can be deployed to make real time identifications within groups containing thousands of taxa (e.g. true flies).|$|E
40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{embedded}} processor cores are integrated into most system-on-chip (SoC). Processor cores {{can be designed}} to be dedicated for an SoC. However, reusing of generic processors is often preferred due to time to market constraint. Such processors have drawbacks in terms of hardware complexity and power consumption. Indeed, some of their instructions and hardware resources are useless. These area and energy inefficiencies are problematic for low-cost and low-energy systems. In this paper, we propose a methodology for automatically reducing processor functionalities and the resulting hardware complexity according to real-application requirements.
