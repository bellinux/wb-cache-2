40|$|Abstract—An {{automatic}} system for segmenting and constructing volumetric representations of excised <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> from Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (PQCT) imagery is presented. The {{system is designed}} to allow for automatic quantitative analysis of progressive herniation damage to the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> under flexion/extension motions combined with a compressive load. Automatic segmentation and volumetric reconstruction of <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> from PQCT imagery is a very challenging problem due to factors such as streak artifacts and unclear material density separation between contrasted <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> and surrounding bone in the PQCT imagery, {{as well as the}} formation of multiple contrasted regions under axial scans. To address these factors, a novel multi-scale level set approach based on the Mumford-Shah energy functional in iterative bilateral scale space is employed to segment the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> regions from the PQCT imagery. A Delaunay triangulation is then performed based on the set of points associated with the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> regions to construct the volumetric representation of the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc.</b> Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves segmentation and volumetric reconstructions of <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> with mean absolute distance (MAD) error of under 0. 8 mm when compared to ground-truth measurements. The proposed system is currently in operational use as a visualization tool for studying progressive <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> damage.

40|$|<b>Intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> {{degeneration}} is {{a significant}} contributor {{to the development of}} back pain and the leading cause of disability worldwide. Numerous animal models of <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> degeneration have been developed. The ideal animal model should closely mimic the human <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> with regard to morphology, biomechanical properties and the absence of notochordal cells. The sheep lumbar <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> model fulfils these criteria. We present an ovine model of <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> degeneration utilizing a drill bit injury through a lateral retroperitoneal approach. The lateral approach significantly reduces the incision and potential morbidity associated with the traditional anterior approach to the ovine spine. Utilization of a drill-bit method of injury affords the ability to produce a consistent and reproducible injury, of precise dimensions, that initiates a consistent degree of <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> degeneration. The focal nature of the annular and nucleus pulposus defect more closely mimics the clinical condition of focal <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> herniation. Sheep recover rapidly following this procedure and are typically mobile and eating within the hour. <b>Intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> degeneration ensues and sheep undergo necropsy and subsequent analysis at periods from eight weeks. We believe that the drill bit injury model of <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> degeneration offers advantages over more conventional annular injury models...|$|R

40|$|Background/Objective: Whole organ in vitro <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> {{models have}} been {{associated}} with poor maintenance of cell viability. No previous studies have used a rotating wall vessel bioreactor for <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> explants culture. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop and validate an in vitro model for the assessment of biological and biomechanical measures of <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> health and disease. Methods: To this end, endplate-intervertebral disc-endplate whole organ explants were harvested from the tails of rats. For the injured group, the annulus fibrosus was penetrated with a 20 G needle to the nucleus pulposus and aspirated. Explants were cultured in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor for 14 days. Results: Cell viability and histologic assessments were performed at Day 0, Day 1, Day 7, and Day 14. Compressive mechanical properties of the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> were assessed at Day 0 and Day 14. In the annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus cells, the uninjured group maintained high viability through 14 days of culture, whereas cell viability in annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus of the injured <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> was markedly lower at Day 7 and Day 14. Histologically, the uninjured <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> maintained cell viability and tissue morphology and architecture through 14 days, whereas the injured <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> showed areas of cell death, loss of extracellular matrix integrity, and architecture by Day 14. Stiffness values for uninjured <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> were similar at Day 0 and Day 14, whereas the stiffness for the injured <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> was approximately 2. 5 times greater at Day 14. Conclusion: These results suggest that whole organ <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> explants can be successfully cultured in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor to maintain cell viability and tissue architecture in both annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus for at least 14 days. In addition, the injury used produced pathologic changes consistent with those seen in degenerative <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> disease in humans. This model will permit further study into potential future treatments and other mechanisms of addressing <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> disease...|$|R

40|$|Degenerative spine {{diseases}} are common throughout the world. There are many factors {{that lead to}} these diseases. One of these exogenous factors may be Pb exposure. Most of the fundamental investigations about {{the negative effects of}} the Pb exposure have investigated the impact of high doses of Pb, while Pb exposure in low concentrations has been insufficiently studied. The nutrition of the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> is provided by the vessels that grow into the vertebral bodies and the paravertebral tissue. This suggests the possibility that Pb penetrates from the bone to the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> together with nutrients. This article reports an experimental study which was performed in rats aged 1. 5  months (n = 40). Rats in the experimental group received lead acetate solution (230 mg of Pb per 1 literof distilled water) as drinking water and the animals in the control group received distilled water for 10 weeks. In the isolated <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs,</b> the content of Pb was determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The effect of lead on the structural organization of the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> was investigated by light microscopy. The ultrastructural features of cells and the matrix <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> were studied by transmission electron microscopy. In the young animals after Pb exposure, a significant increase was found in the content of Pb in the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> tissue, of 4. 6 times compared to the control group. The histological analysis showed degenerative changes in the annulus fibrosus (AF) of the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc.</b> In the outer region cracks and defibration of the lamellae were observed. Large isogenic groups were detected in the inner region of the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc.</b> A decrease in the height by 12. 2 % in the outer parts and by 10 % in {{the central part of the}} <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> was recorded. Also a reduction in the width of the lamellae by 8 % was shown. Cell density of the annulus fibrous decreased by 12 % and in the gelatinous nucleus pulposus (NP) by 24. 2 %. Electron microscopic analysis of the inner region of the AF of the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> showed chondrocytes with electron-dense mitochondria, vacuolization of the cytoplasm, fragmented nuclei and destructive cavities. The matrix of the lamellae of the AF had a diverse electron density, so areas with high electron density of various sizes were observed. Collagen fibrils of the AF had blurred outlines, sometimes the transverse striation disappeared or it was irregular, which can indicate the matrix mineralization and possibly the accumulation of Pb in these areas. In the NP, the most notochordal cells revealed the formation of myelin figures. The effect of Pb at low concentration results in its accumulation in the tissues of the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> of rats and causes degenerative changes in the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> structure, leading to the reduction in the height of the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc,</b> decrease in the width of the lamellae and in cell density, thereby violating both the structures of matrix and cells.
