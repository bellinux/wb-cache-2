40|$|<b>Factorial</b> <b>moments</b> are {{convenient}} {{tools in}} nuclear physics {{to characterize the}} multiplicity distributions when phase-space resolution (Δ) becomes small. For uncorrelated particle production within Δ, Gaussian statistics holds and <b>factorial</b> <b>moments</b> F_q are equal to unity for all orders q. Correlations between particles lead to a broadening of the multiplicity distribution and to dynamical fluctuations. In this case, the <b>factorial</b> <b>moments</b> increase above 1 with decreasing Δ. This corresponds to what can be called intermittency. In this letter, we show that a similar analysis can be developed on financial price series, with an adequate definition of <b>factorial</b> <b>moments.</b> An intermittent behavior can be extracted using moments of order 2 (F_ 2), illustrating a sensitivity to non-Gaussian fluctuations within time resolution below 4 hours. This confirms that correlations between price returns start {{to play a role}} when the time resolution is below this threshold. ...|$|R
