5|$|Men with {{wives and}} dependents found it {{difficult}} to support their families. Beyond a small allowance, the men did not get paid for their service, nor were their dependents given an allowance. To be closer to their husbands, women sought employment near their husband's assignment. Later, when jobs on dairy farms became available, <b>families</b> <b>could</b> live together in housing provided for farm workers.|$|E
5|$|Women wore long dresses, blouses {{that came}} down to the knee, skirts and jackets with long or short sleeves, while women from wealthy <b>families</b> <b>could</b> wear purple scarves around their shoulders. The main {{difference}} in women's apparel from that of men was that it was fastened on the left, not on the right.|$|E
5|$|Maeser {{accepted}} his first teaching {{position in the}} First District School in Dresden from 1852 to 1853, and he taught at the Budich Institute beginning in 1854. Maeser continued his teaching career {{when he arrived in}} Utah. He taught at the Deseret Lyceum, an academy established in Salt Lake City in November 1860. The teachers at the Lyceum constructed school slates and performed janitor duties because conditions were so poor. When students' <b>families</b> <b>could</b> not afford to pay tuition, Maeser often collected payments of produce via wheelbarrow.|$|E

5|$|The idea of deporting Polish Jews to Madagascar was {{investigated}} by the Polish government in 1937, but the task force sent to evaluate the island's potential determined that only 5,000 to 7,000 <b>families</b> <b>could</b> be accommodated, or even as few as 500 families by some estimates. Because efforts by the Nazis to encourage the emigration of the Jewish population of Germany before World War II were only partially successful, the idea of deporting Jews to Madagascar was revived by the Nazi government in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} a {{successful}} military campaign could vary in {{its impact on the}} defeated polity. In some cases, entire cities were sacked, and never resettled, as at Aguateca. In other instances, the victors would seize the defeated rulers, their families, and patron gods. The captured nobles and their <b>families</b> <b>could</b> be imprisoned, or sacrificed. At the least severe end of the scale, the defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to the victor.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} amusements {{in the cities}} which could attract audiences rich and poor, such as trained animals {{performing}} tricks, cockfighting and caged animal fights between tigers, horse racing, puppet shows, musical performances with dancing, acrobatic feats, and juggling. Wealthy <b>families</b> <b>could</b> afford their own house choirs and five-piece orchestras with bells, drums, flutes, and stringed instruments. Gambling and board games such as liubo also provided entertainment.|$|E

5|$|Marriage most {{commonly}} involved a betrothal (engue), before the bride was {{given over to}} her new husband and kyrios (ekdosis). A less common form of marriage, practised {{in the case of}} epikleroi, required a court judgement (epidikasia). Athenian women married with a dowry, which was intended to provide their livelihood. Depending on the family, a dowry might have been as much as 25 percent of the family's wealth. Daughters of even the poorest families apparently had dowries worth ten minae. Rich <b>families</b> <b>could</b> provide much larger dowries; Demosthenes' sister, for instance, had a dowry of two talents (120 minae). Dowries usually consisted of movable goods and cash, although land was occasionally included.|$|E
5|$|Rural {{families}} that sold a large agricultural surplus {{to the market}} not only could afford to buy more charcoal, tea, oil, and wine, but they could also amass enough funds to establish secondary means of production for generating more wealth. Besides necessary agricultural foodstuffs, farming <b>families</b> <b>could</b> often produce wine, charcoal, paper, textiles, and other goods they sold through brokers. Farmers in Suzhou often specialized in raising bombyx mori to produce silk wares, while in Fujian, Sichuan, and Guangdong farmers often grew sugarcane. In order to ensure the prosperity of rural areas, technical applications for public works projects and improved agricultural techniques were essential. The vast irrigation system of China had to be furnished with multitudes of wheelwrights mass-producing standardized waterwheels and square-pallet chain pumps that could lift water from lower planes to higher irrigation planes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s and early 1900s {{there were a}} number of {{resettlement}} plans for European Jews that were precursors to the Madagascar Plan. Paul de Lagarde, an Orientalist scholar, first suggested evacuating the European Jews to Madagascar in his 1878 work Deutsche Schriften ("German Writings"). Members of the Zionist movement in 1904–1905 seriously debated the British Uganda Programme, by which Russian Jews, who were in immediate danger from ongoing pogroms, would be settled in what today is Kenya. The plan was later rejected as unworkable by the Zionist Congress. Adherents of territorialism split off from the main Zionist movement and continued to search for a location where Jews might settle and create a state, or at least an autonomous area. The idea of Jewish resettlement in Madagascar was promoted by British antisemites Henry Hamilton Beamish, Arnold Leese, and others. With the cooperation of the French, the Polish government commissioned a task force in 1937 to examine the possibility of deporting Polish Jews to the island. The head of the commission, , felt the island could accommodate 5,000 to 7,000 families, but Jewish members of the group estimated that only 500 or even fewer <b>families</b> <b>could</b> safely be accommodated.|$|E

5|$|On {{top of all}} {{the misery}} the Zoroastrians had to pay a heavy {{religious}} tax known as Jizya. Zoroastrian sources record the method of extracting this as designed to humiliate the dhimmi, the taxed person, who was compelled to stand while the officer receiving the money sat on a high throne. Upon receiving the payment, the officer gave the dhimmi a blow on the neck and drove him roughly away. The public was invited to watch the spectacle. Arab tax collectors would mock Zoroastrians for wearing Kushti and would rip it off, hanging the cord around the necks of the beleaguered faithful. Due to corruption of the tax officials, at times twice and even three times the official figure would be collected, because every intermediary had to receive his share. If the <b>families</b> <b>could</b> not afford paying the Jizya, their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire. That is how the term “the bookless” came about. Under the woeful conditions, some had to convert and {{there were those who}} declared themselves Muslims, picked up Islamic names, but in secret continued Zoroastrian practices. Today the latter group among the Zoroastrians is known as Jaddid. In response to persecution and segregation policies, the Zoroastrians community became closed, introverted, and static.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the reasons}} {{children}} were placed in care related to poverty and family breakdown. Until social change came about in Australia in the 1970s, {{there was almost no}} community or government support for families in crisis or financial need so most children whose <b>families</b> <b>could</b> not care for them were placed in some form of out-of-home care.|$|E

25|$|In 1921, factory-made radios {{were very}} expensive. Since less-affluent <b>families</b> <b>could</b> {{not afford to}} own one, {{newspapers}} and magazines carried articles on {{how to build a}} crystal radio with common household items. To minimize the cost, many of the plans suggested winding the tuning coil on empty pasteboard containers such as oatmeal boxes, which became a common foundation for homemade radios.|$|E

Parents would then contract with a biochemist to purify enough growth hormone to treat their child. Few <b>families</b> <b>could</b> manage such a complicated undertaking.|$|E
25|$|Women's {{primary role}} were as housewives; without {{a steady flow}} of family income, their work became much harder in dealing with food and {{clothing}} and medical care.

The average birthrate for 14 major countries fell 12% from 19.3 births per thousand population in 1930, to 17.0 in 1935.
