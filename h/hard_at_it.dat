25|$|Told {{partly in}} flashback, {{it is the}} story of Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand) and Hubbell Gardiner (Robert Redford). Their {{differences}} are immense: she is a stridently vocal Marxist Jew with strong anti-war opinions, and he is a carefree WASP with no particular political bent. While attending the same college, she is drawn to him because of his boyish good looks and his natural writing skill, which she finds captivating, although he does not work very <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> He is intrigued by her conviction and her determination to persuade others to take up social causes. Their attraction is evident, but neither of them acts upon it, and they lose touch after graduation.|$|E
500|$|Attempting {{to perfect}} their work, Coldplay had to [...] "step it {{up a few}} notches and work <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> to get it right". The band chose Danton Supple, who mixed the bulk of A Rush of Blood to the Head, to oversee the {{production}} of X. When January went, the band had to finish the album; they were conscious of the pressure as [...] "expectations for the record grew larger" [...] and [...] "completing it became tougher and tougher". Finally, the band was settled with the song [...] "Square One", which Martin has described as [...] "a call to arms" [...] and a [...] "plea" [...] {{to each of them}} [...] "not to be intimidated by anything or anyone else". Once finished, the band felt like they could do their own songs and not have to think of anyone else's demands. During this month, the band was into the final weeks of production and had put the finishing touches on the tracks.|$|E

500|$|The Village Voice {{called the}} sound [...] "emo-core... intercut with elegiac little pauses that align Blink 182 with {{a branch of}} punk rock you could trace back through The Replacements and Ramones Leave Home, to the more {{ethereal}} of early Who songs". Aaron Scott of Slant Magazine, however, found the sound to be recycled from the band's previous efforts, writing, [...] "Blink shines when they deviate from their formula, but it is awfully rare... The album {{seems to be more}} concerned with maintaining the band's large teenage fanbase than with expanding their overall audience." [...] Entertainment Weekly felt similarly, with David Browne opining that [...] "the album is angrier and more teeth gnashing than you'd expect. The band work so <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> and the music is such processed sounding mainstream rock played fast, that the album becomes a paradox: adolescent energy and rebellion made joyless". British magazine New Musical Express, who heavily criticized the band in their previous efforts, felt no more negative this time, saying [...] "Blink-182 are now indistinguishable from the increasingly tedious 'teenage dirtbag' genre they helped spawn". The magazine continued, [...] "It [...] like all that sanitised, castrated, shrink-wrapped 'new wave' crap that the major US record companies pumped out circa 1981 in their belated attempt to jump on the 'punk' bandwagon." ...|$|E
500|$|Patton {{called his}} career, with its mixture of children's {{television}} and darker roles in independent films, [...] "an odd experience" [...] and {{told a reporter}} that he had spent half his life at Nickelodeon. [...] In 2009, he was cast as Bot, the robot superhero, on the children's show Team Umizoomi through the relationships he had made at Nickelodeon on Blue's Clues. [...] He found working on Team Umizoomi [...] "comforting" [...] {{because many of the}} same crew, producers, and creators had also worked on Blue's Clues. [...] It {{was the first time he}} had worked as a voice-over artist, unlike on Blue's Clues, when he was able to be more physical acting in front of a blue screen. [...] He said, about Team Umizoomi, [...] "the work the animators have done on it has been superlative". [...] He stated that he enjoyed working on Team Umizoomi because it gave him the opportunity to participate in a show from its inception, which he had missed with Blue's Clues. [...] Patton said his voice performance of Bot, which he modeled on Brent Spiner's performance as the android Data on [...] and was influenced by Mel Blanc's work in the classic Warner Bros. cartoons, [...] "ended up sounding more like my natural voice, with a teeny bit of superhero in there". [...] Despite both roles in Blue's Clues and Team Umizoomi requiring him to sing, he did not consider himself a natural singer and felt that he had to work <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> [...] He said, about being cast as Bot, [...] "I get to be a superhero. Who doesn't want to be a superhero"?.|$|E
