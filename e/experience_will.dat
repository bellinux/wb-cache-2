The single-player <b>experience</b> <b>will</b> eclipse the beauty, grandeur, and mind-challenging elements of previous titles. Plus, with the option to join a constantly updated online universe, the adventure never has to end. From new machines and puzzles to special events and entirely new Ages, players will find more to do, more to see, and more to explore each time they return—and this time, they can discover everything with old and new friends.|$|E

25|$|Clites {{recognized}} that these journeying players need {{an incentive to}} come back to St. Louis for their summer months. Their parents likely prefer it, and the availability of a familiar job increases, but that is not enough. The convincing requirement for the student-athlete is whether their summer baseball <b>experience</b> <b>will</b> be top-notch.

25|$|We create karma {{in three}} {{different}} ways, through actions that are positive, negative, or neutral. When we feel kindness and love and with this attitude do good things, which are beneficial to both ourselves and others, this is positive action. When we commit harmful deeds out of equally harmful intentions, this is negative action. Finally, when our motivation is indifferent and our deeds are neither harmful or beneficial, this is neutral action. The results we <b>experience</b> <b>will</b> accord {{with the quality of}} our actions.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{males with}} {{previous}} sexual <b>experience</b> <b>will</b> modify their courtship dance {{when attempting to}} mate with new females — the experienced males spend less time courting and therefore have lower mating latencies, meaning {{that they are able}} to reproduce more quickly. This decreased mating latency leads to a greater mating efficiency for experienced males over naïve males. This modification also appears to have obvious evolutionary advantages, as increased mating efficiency is extremely important in the eyes of natural selection.|$|E

25|$|There are however, some {{actions of}} prey species are clearly {{directed}} to actual or potential predators. A {{good example is}} warning colouration: species such as wasps {{that are capable of}} harming potential predators are often brightly coloured, and this modifies the behaviour of the predator, who either instinctively or as the result of <b>experience</b> <b>will</b> avoid attacking such an animal. Some forms of mimicry fall in the same category: for example hoverflies are coloured {{in the same way as}} wasps, and although they are unable to sting, the strong avoidance of wasps by predators gives the hoverfly some protection. There are also behavioural changes that act in a similar way to warning colouration. For example, canines such as wolves and coyotes may adopt an aggressive posture, such as growling with their teeth bared, to indicate they will fight if necessary, and rattlesnakes use their well-known rattle to warn potential predators of their venomous bite. Sometimes, a behavioural change and warning colouration will be combined, as in certain species of amphibians which have most of their body coloured to blend with their surroundings, except for a brightly coloured belly. When confronted with a potential threat, they show their belly, indicating that they are poisonous in some way.|$|E

As such, Microsoft does not officially consider Windows RT to be a supported upgrade path to Windows 10. Shortly afterward, Microsoft ended production of both the Surface 2 and Lumia 2520.|$|E
2500|$|Role-playing games usually measure {{progress}} by counting experience points and character levels. Experience is usually earned by defeating enemies in combat, with some games offering experience for completing certain quests or conversations. Experience becomes {{a form of}} score, and accumulating {{a certain amount of}} <b>experience</b> <b>will</b> cause the character's level to go up. This is called [...] "levelling up", and gives the player an opportunity to raise one or more of his character's attributes. Many RPGs allow players to choose how to improve their character, by allocating a finite number of points into the attributes of their choice. Gaining <b>experience</b> <b>will</b> also unlock new magic spells for characters that use magic.|$|E
