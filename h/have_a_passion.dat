5|$|The events {{depicted}} in Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption occur in two time periods: 12th century Prague and Vienna, and late-20th century London and New York City. The game {{is set in}} the World of Darkness; it depicts a world in which vampires, werewolves, demons, and other creatures influence human history. The vampires are divided into seven Clans of the Camarilla—the vampire government—each with distinctive traits and abilities. The Toreadors are the closest to humanity—they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>passion</b> for culture; the Ventrue are noble, powerful leaders; the Brujah are idealists who excel at fighting; the Malkavians are either cursed with insanity or blessed with insight; the Gangrel are loners in synchronization with their animalistic nature; the Tremere are secretive, untrustworthy, and wield blood magic; and the monstrous Nosferatu are condemned to remain hidden in the shadows. Redemption also features the Cappadocian clan; the Society of Leopold—modern-day vampire hunters; the Assamite clan of assassin vampires; the Setite clan; and the Sabbat—vampires who revel in their nature, embracing the beast within.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, but {{especially}} London, during the 1970s and the 1980s {{the teaching and}} playing of cricket was dying in schools funded by the state, for many complex reasons and by 1990 only 20 {{out of more than}} 800 such schools in London were playing the game. The teaching of cricket has declined throughout England in recent years, but the issue is compounded in London as there are few local teams with their own grounds on which children can be taught. To counter this lack of interest, CKC was set up by two Yorkshiremen William Greaves and Hayden Turner, who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>passion</b> for cricket, and were concerned at its decline.|$|E
500|$|Shinkai {{originally}} envisioned Takao {{as a boy}} {{who wants}} to help people, but also felt that he should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>passion</b> for making something, since creative work can be rewarding and fulfilling. On a list he made of potential crafts, he picked out the word [...] "shoes". After testing it out with his initial plans for the story, he found that it worked out, and in hindsight, he realized that shoemakers also assist people with walking.|$|E

500|$|Following {{news of the}} {{cancellation}} of Silent Hills, {{it was announced that}} P.T. would be removed from the PlayStation Network on 29 April 2015. Originally, it was reported that the demo could be re-downloaded, but in May 2015 it was no longer re-downloadable from the PlayStation Store. Cancellation of the game led to criticism of Konami. Patrick Klepek from Kotaku stated [...] "It's fine that Konami doesn't want to make Silent Hills" [...] but that the deletion of P.T. was wrong since the demo had become part of gaming culture. Nick Robinson of Polygon described Konami's removal as the [...] "most irresponsible, cowardly decision possible", but that the subsequent unavailability had also made the demo [...] "one of the coolest, most fascinating games {{in the history of our}} medium". After {{the cancellation}}, PlayStation 4 consoles with P.T. installed were listed on eBay for over $1000; eBay later pulled the auctions down. The incident has been compared to the mass selling of iPhones containing Flappy Bird after that game's removal from the iOS App Store. Guillermo del Toro, the intended future director of Silent Hills, commented on P.T.s popularity, speculating that there were people who still <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>passion</b> for the Silent Hill series.|$|E

What you can do now {{is to make sure that}} it doesn't happen to some other woman." [...] Leibowitz objected that the argument was [...] "an appeal to passion and prejudice" [...] and moved for a mistrial. Knight agreed that it was an appeal to passion, and Callahan overruled the motion. Knight continued, [...] "We all <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>passion,</b> all men in this court room to protect the womanhood in Alabama." [...] For his summation, solicitor Wade Wright reviewed the testimony and warned the jury, [...] "that this crime could have happened to any woman, even though she was riding in a parlor car, instead of box car." ...|$|E
