5|$|Linezolid was {{discovered}} in the mid 1990s and was approved for commercial use in 2000. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Linezolid is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$ 2.90 USD per day while that in the United States as of 2016 is about US$13.79 per day. It appears to be more cost-effective than alternatives such as vancomycin, mostly because of the ability to switch from <b>intravenous</b> <b>use</b> to administration by mouth sooner.|$|E
5|$|Recommended {{treatment}} for severe malaria is the <b>intravenous</b> <b>use</b> of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate {{was superior to}} quinine in both children and adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{side-effects}} of benzodiazepines {{are related to}} their sedating and muscle-relaxing action. They include drowsiness, dizziness, and decreased alertness and concentration. Lack of coordination may result in falls and injuries, in particular, in the elderly. Another result is impairment of driving skills and increased likelihood of road traffic accidents. Decreased libido and erection problems are a common side effect. Depression and disinhibition may emerge. Hypotension and suppressed breathing (hypoventilation) may be encountered with <b>intravenous</b> <b>use.</b> Less common side effects include nausea and changes in appetite, blurred vision, confusion, euphoria, depersonalization and nightmares. Cases of liver toxicity have been described but are very rare.|$|E

25|$|In Finland, {{temazepam}} is {{more tightly}} controlled than other benzodiazepines. The temazepam product Normison was {{pulled out of}} shelves and banned because the liquid inside gelatin capsules had caused a large increase in intravenous temazepam use. The other temazepam product, Tenox, was not affected and remains as prescription medicine. Temazepam <b>intravenous</b> <b>use</b> has not decreased to the level before Normison came to the market.|$|E
25|$|Palonosetron is {{the newest}} 5-HT3 {{antagonist}} to become available in the U.S. market. It is an isoquinoline derivative, and is effective in preventing delayed CINV.

25|$|Pantoprazole was {{identified}} after nearly {{seven years of}} research and registered for clinical use after a further seven years of development, and finally reached its first market in 1994 in Germany. During {{the course of the}} studies on pantoprazole, more than 650 PPIs had been synthesized and evaluated. Pantoprazole obtained high selection criteria in its development process—especially concerning the favorable low potential for interaction with other drugs. Good solubility of pantoprazole and a very high solution stability allowed it to become the first marketed PPI for <b>intravenous</b> <b>use</b> in critical care patients.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} with <b>intravenous</b> <b>use</b> include sleepiness, muscle twitching, confusion, changes in vision, numbness, tingling, and vomiting. It can cause low blood {{pressure}} and an irregular heart rate. There are concerns that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage. It appears to be generally safe for use in pregnancy. A lower dose may be required in those with liver problems. It is generally safe to use in those allergic to tetracaine or benzocaine. Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic medication of the class Ib type. Lidocaine works by blocking sodium channels and thus decreasing the rate of contractions of the heart. When used locally as a numbing agent, local neurons cannot signal the brain.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines {{are common}} drugs of abuse in Australia and New Zealand, {{particularly}} {{among those who}} may also be using other illicit drugs. The <b>intravenous</b> <b>use</b> of temazepam poses {{the greatest threat to}} those who misuse benzodiazepines. Simultaneous consumption of temazepam with heroin is a potential risk factor of overdose. An Australian study of non-fatal heroin overdoses noted that 26% of heroin users had consumed temazepam {{at the time of their}} overdose. This is consistent with an NSW investigation of coronial files from 1992. Temazepam was found in 26% of heroin-related deaths. Temazepam, including tablet formulations, are used intravenously. In an Australian study of 210 heroin users who used temazepam, 48% had injected it. Although abuse of benzodiazepines has decreased over the past few years, temazepam continues to be a major drug of abuse in Australia. In certain states like Victoria and Queensland, temazepam accounts for most benzodiazepine sought by forgery of prescriptions and through pharmacy burglary. Darke, Ross & Hall found that different benzodiazepines have different abuse potential. The more rapid the increase in the plasma level following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the ‘popularity’ of that drug for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference for a benzodiazepine were that it was the ‘strongest’ and that it gave a good ‘high’.|$|E

500|$|Professor Shiela Bird, a {{statistician}} at the Medical Research Council, {{suggested the}} ban of mephedrone {{may lead to}} more cocaine-related deaths. In {{the first six months}} of 2009, the number of cocaine-related deaths fell for the first time in four years, and fewer soldiers tested positive for cocaine in 2009 than in 2008. She suggested this may have been due to users switching to mephedrone from cocaine, but cautioned that before full figures are available for 2009 and 2010, it will be difficult to determine whether mephedrone saved lives, rather than cost them. Other supposedly legal drugs have filled the gap in the market since mephedrone was made illegal, including naphyrone (NRG-1) (since made illegal) and Ivory Wave, which has been found to contain MDPV, a compound made illegal at the same time as mephedrone. However, some products branded as Ivory Wave possibly do not contain MDPV. When tested, some products sold six weeks after mephedrone was banned, advertised as NRG-1, NRG-2 and MDAI, were found to be mephedrone. A Drugscope survey of drugs workers at the end of 2012 reported that mephedrone use was still widespread in the UK and that there increasing reports of problematic users. It was being taken as not only a [...] "poor man's cocaine" [...] but also amongst users of heroin and crack cocaine. Cases of <b>intravenous</b> <b>use</b> were also reported to be on the increase.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Intravenous</b> <b>use</b> has {{the most}} {{reported}} adverse reactions, including sudden death, but this may reflect greater use rather than greater risk. [...] Both oral and topical uses {{have been reported to}} cause anaphylaxis, including one case of anaphylaxis with cardiac arrest (resuscitated) following topical use in an eye drop. Reported rates of adverse reactions vary from 1% to 6%. The higher rates may reflect study populations that include a higher percentage of persons with prior adverse reactions. [...] The risk of an adverse reaction is 25 times higher if the person has had a prior adverse reaction. [...] The risk can be reduced with prior (prophylactic) use of antihistamines ...|$|E
2500|$|The FDA was {{reluctant}} to officially approve the use of amiodarone since initial reports had shown increased incidence of serious pulmonary side-effects of the drug. [...] In the mid-1980s, the European pharmaceutical companies began putting pressure on the FDA to approve amiodarone by threatening to cut the supply to American physicians {{if it was not}} approved. [...] In December 1985, amiodarone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of arrhythmias. This makes amiodarone one of the few drugs approved by the FDA without rigorous randomized clinical trials. In 1995, amiodarone was approved for the treatment of atrial fibrillation as an injection for <b>intravenous</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
40|$|Background Phlebitis is {{a common}} {{complication}} in patients with peripheral intravenous catheters, in addition to extravasation and bacterial colonization. Phlebitis may increase morbidity and length of hospitalization. One factor contributing to the rate of phlebitis is the duration of peripheral <b>intravenous</b> catheter <b>use.</b> Several adult {{studies have shown that}} the risk of developing phlebitis increased when the peripheral <b>intravenous</b> catheter was <b>used</b> for more than 72 hours. However, in pediatric patients this risk has not been consistently observed. As such, there is no recommendation for routine catheter removal every 72 hours in children. Objective To assess for a possible relationship between duration of peripheral <b>intravenous</b> catheter <b>use</b> and the development of phlebitis. Methods This analytic observational study had a case control design. Subjects consisted of 73 case subjects and 73 control subjects. We collected subj ects' data through history-taking and clinical examinations. The duration of peripheral <b>intravenous</b> catheter <b>use</b> was reported in hours. Results From October 2011 to February 2012, 146 children from the Department of Child Health at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hosp ital and Tangerang Hospital who <b>used</b> peripheral <b>intravenous</b> catheters were enrolled in this study. There was no significant difference between < 7 2 -hour and 2 : 72 -hour duration of peripheral catheter use (OR 1. 31; 95 %CI 0. 687 to 2. 526; P= 0. 407) on the development of phlebitis.
