5|$|Across England, {{many public}} houses and inns were renamed after Daniel Lambert, {{particularly}} in Leicester and Stamford. The Daniel Lambert public house at 12 Ludgate Hill, {{near the entrance}} to St Paul's Cathedral in London, was well known, and had a large portrait of Daniel Lambert and Lambert's walking stick on display in the lobby. James Dixon, owner of the Ram Jam Inn in Stamford, bought the suit of clothes Lambert <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>wearing</b> when he died and put it on display, renaming the inn the Daniel Lambert.|$|E
5|$|Saitō then {{travels to}} Kyoto to fight Shishio under {{government}} orders. Along with Kenshin and Sanosuke, he assaults Shishio's battleship, the Purgatory. Accepting Shishio's challenge {{to fight on}} Mount Hiei, Saitō kills Uonuma Usui, one of the Ten Swords, and later ambushes Shishio, almost, but failing to kill him as Shishio <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>wearing</b> a hachigane (iron headband). Months later, Saitō is sent to arrest Yukishiro Enishi and he helps Kenshin fight against The Six Comrades, defeating Yatsume Mumyōi. He also fights against {{the first of the}} four Sū-shin guards of Woo Heishin, Enishi's second-in-command, and defeats him. Afterwards, Saitō is transferred to work in another location after rejecting the continuation of his duel with Kenshin. Five {{years after the end of}} series, it is revealed that Saitō continues to work for the government.|$|E
5|$|While the NHL {{returned}} to action in 2005–06, {{he missed the}} first month of the season after suffering a knee injury in a pre-season game. Doctors considered Regehr fortunate, believing that a knee brace he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>wearing</b> prevented a more severe injury that would have seen him miss up to six months. Despite missing 14 games, he set career highs in goals (6), assists (20) and points (26). He continued to quietly lead the Flames defence and earned a spot on the Canadian Olympic team in 2006. Regehr briefly played with his brother, Richie, who made his NHL debut with the Flames on December 29, 2005. He played the full season in 2006–07, including his 500th career game on March 15, 2007, against the Dallas Stars and scored his 100th career point on March 31 against the Vancouver Canucks. However, he was again forced out of the lineup due to a knee injury after only one game in the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs.|$|E

25|$|Two {{rumors about}} finalist Katharine McPhee {{circulated}} during early March {{and throughout the}} season. The first {{was that she was}} quitting the show and would not show up for the March 7th airing. The second was sparked by the loose fitting blouses she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>wearing,</b> leading viewers to suspect she was pregnant. Katharine denied both rumors when interviewed by host Ryan Seacrest on the March 7th show.|$|E

25|$|Gardner {{returned}} home from jail to find his apartment empty. With no experience, no college education, virtually no connections, and with the same casual outfit he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>wearing</b> {{on the day he}} was taken into custody, Gardner gained a position in Dean Witter Reynolds' stock brokerage training program. However, this offered no salary; apart from selling medical equipment that brought in 300–400 dollars a month in the early 1980s, and with no savings, he was unable to meet his living expenses.|$|E
25|$|During {{the cruise}} to Japan, Alice {{jumped into the}} ship's pool fully clothed, and coaxed Congressman Longworth to join her in the water. (Years later Bobby Kennedy would chide her about the incident, saying it was {{outrageous}} for the time, to which the by-then-octogenarian Alice replied that it would only have been outrageous had she removed her clothes.) In her autobiography, Crowded Hours, Alice made note of the event, pointing {{out that there was}} little difference between the linen skirt and blouse she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>wearing</b> and a lady's swimsuit of the period.|$|E
25|$|In July 2004, Frank Cole, a Melbourne pensioner, {{claimed that}} he had shot a dingo in 1980 and found a baby in its mouth. After {{interviewing}} Cole on the matter, police decided not to reopen the case. He claimed to have the ribbons from the jacket which Azaria <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>wearing</b> when she disappeared as proof of his involvement. However, Lindy Chamberlain claimed that the jacket had no ribbons on it. Cole's credibility was further damaged when it was revealed he had made unsubstantiated claims about another case.|$|E

The body believed to be Elena's had decayed too much to allow for a positive identification, but Nicolae was easily identifiable, wearing the bullet-riddled black winter coat he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>wearing</b> when he was killed. DNA was able to conclusively prove his identity. His family organized a funeral service for the couple, and they were reburied together at Ghencea, under a modest tombstone.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, a 10-year {{study of}} trauma center {{patients}} injured while riding reported that although 48% had suffered head injuries, only 9% of these riders <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>wearing</b> helmets {{at the time}} of their accident. Other injuries involved the chest (54%), abdomen (22%) and extremities (17%). A German study reported that injuries in horse riding are rare compared to other sports, but when they occur they are severe. Specifically, they found that 40% of horse riding injuries were fractures, and only 15% were sprains. Furthermore, the study noted that in Germany, one quarter of all sport related fatalities are caused by horse riding.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{reports of}} Savage's death {{indicated}} {{that he had been}} killed in the collision, when, in fact, he and his wife <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>wearing</b> seatbelts and suffered only minor physical injuries in the crash. An autopsy performed by the medical examiner's office found that he had an enlarged heart and advanced coronary artery disease (more than 90% narrowed). The drugs found in his system included a prescription painkiller and a small amount of alcohol. Savage had never been treated for heart problems and {{there was no evidence that}} he was aware of his heart condition. The cause of death was officially ruled as atherosclerotic heart disease.|$|E

25|$|When Cook visited Hawaii for {{the first}} time in January 1778. Cook was {{received}} by high chief Kalaniʻōpuʻu. Kalaniʻōpuʻu had with him six feather cloaks and a helmet. At the end of the meeting Cook was given the helmet and cloak that Kalaniʻōpuʻu <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>wearing.</b> On the expedition's return much of Cook's collection was exhibited in the Leverian Museum. Lever's collection was then disposed of by public lottery, was obtained by James Parkinson, and was exhibited in the Blackfriars Rotunda. He eventually sold this collection in 7,000 separate lots, in 1806. The British Museum failed to bid on these items as Sir Joseph Banks had advised them that there was nothing of value. Many items were purchased by Baron Leopold von Fichtel for the museum in Vienna.|$|E
25|$|Ray storms Mendoza's alcazar, {{fighting}} {{his way to}} Molly's cell. However, Mendoza traps {{them both}} inside and sets fire to the cell.

However, as Ray leaves the cell, Mendoza appears and shoots him at close range, revealing he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>wearing</b> armor when Billy shot him. Juarez and Billy fight, with Billy defeating him. As he lies dying, Ray realizes the whole affair was his fault, and prays that his actions will not lead {{to the deaths of}} Billy and Molly. He recovers his strength just as Mendoza pulls a knife and is about to attack Billy from behind. With his last action, Ray kills Mendoza, before dying happily.|$|E
25|$|A {{break in}} the case came in 1998, when police noticed that broken {{concrete}} at Miracle Motors, a business owned by Karyn's ex-father-in-law Michael Slover Sr, were similar to concrete blocks used to weigh down Karyn's body. A forensic geologist {{was brought in to}} see if anything on the Slovers' business matched evidence found {{at the scene of the}} crime. The geologist found that not only was the concrete consistent with that found at Miracle Motors, but that evidence found in the abandoned car was also likely from Slover's business. The task force sifted through dirt at Miracle Motors and eventually discovered a metal rivet and a plastic button that fit a pair of Paris Club jeans and a white shirt that Karyn <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>wearing</b> the day of her murder. Police also reported finding bones at the scene, but these were not introduced to trial and were believed to have been animal meat bones that came from food fed to two dogs that Slover used to secure the property.|$|E
