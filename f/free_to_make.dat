5|$|By {{the end of}} the year, Monroe and Fox {{had come}} to an {{agreement}} about a new seven-year contract. It was clear that MMP {{would not be able to}} finance films alone, and the studio was eager to have Monroe working again. The contract required her to make four movies for Fox during the seven years. The studio would pay her $100,000 for each movie, and granted her the right to choose her own projects, directors and cinematographers. She would also be <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> one film with MMP per each completed film for Fox.|$|E
5|$|Dive tables or {{decompression}} {{tables are}} tabulated data, {{often in the}} form of printed cards or booklets, that allow divers to determine a decompression schedule for a given dive profile and breathing gas. In some cases they may also specify an altitude range.

5|$|Even {{before the}} mayoral election, there was support for Lane as a {{potential}} Democratic candidate for Vice President, though since {{he was born in}} what was by then a Canadian province he was ineligible under the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an era when political convention delegates were far more <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their own choices than they are today, Lane wrote that he had heard that he could gain the support of the New York delegation, which he declined to do. While returning to California from a trip to Washington, D.C., as an advocate for the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project, he stopped in Austin, Texas, to confer with Democratic leaders and address the legislature. The New York Times saw this as part of a campaign to secure the vice-presidential nomination, and stated that he had been promised help from Texas.|$|E

50|$|Hopkins was {{initially}} {{a student of}} the Christian Science of Mary Baker Eddy, who claimed to have found in the Christian Bible a science behind the alleged healing miracles of Jesus which could be practiced by anyone. She would afterwards (see below) leave Christian Science to develop her own more eclectic form of metaphysical idealism, known later as New Thought with, like it, certain mystical traits of Gnosticism, though Hopkins felt much <b>freer</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> affinities with Theosophy and a wide variety of Eastern teachings.|$|R

25|$|In 1798, {{he entered}} the École Polytechnique in Paris as first in his year, and {{immediately}} began to attract the notice of the professors of the school, who left him <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his own decisions as to what he would study. In 1800, {{less than two years}} after his entry, he published two memoirs, one on Étienne Bézout's method of elimination, the other on the number of integrals of a finite difference equation. The latter was examined by Sylvestre-François Lacroix and Adrien-Marie Legendre, who recommended that it should be published in the Recueil des savants étrangers, an unprecedented honour for a youth of eighteen. This success at once procured entry for Poisson into scientific circles. Joseph Louis Lagrange, whose lectures on the theory of functions he attended at the École Polytechnique, recognized his talent early on, and became his friend (the Mathematics Genealogy Project lists Lagrange as his advisor, but this may be an approximation); while Pierre-Simon Laplace, in whose footsteps Poisson followed, regarded him almost as his son. The rest of his career, till his death in Sceaux near Paris, was nearly occupied by the composition and publication of his many works and in fulfilling the duties of the numerous educational positions to which he was successively appointed.|$|E

[...] He has no intentions to preach his beliefs through his art, believing that people should be <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up their own minds and that the best he can do is to make readers ponder the deeper meanings behind a humorous scene.

Dunne had been able to secure copies of most or all of his work, and the second volume contains [...] "The Irishman Abroad", the fifth Dooley piece published; more than half are stories of Bridgeport, including some of Dunne's character studies of its denizens. The volume was well received by critics.|$|E
500|$|Whatever {{the surface}} {{incompatibilities}} between Hugill and the Social Credit movement, in the runup to the 1935 provincial election Aberhart found his team lacking both mainstream respectability and legal expertise, and so recruited Hugill {{to run as}} a Social Credit candidate in Calgary. [...] During the campaign, Hugill attracted attention by refusing (on Aberhart's instructions, and like other Social Credit candidates) to accept questions from the floor at political meetings. [...] The Calgary Albertan took note of this practice, commenting [...] "it must be rather irritating for a gentleman like J. W. Hugill, a practitioner {{at the bar and}} a King's Counsel withal, skilled and experienced in the art of debate, not to be <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> use of it".|$|E

500|$|The {{danger is}} perhaps not great if the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that Lady Chatterley's Lover goes so far beyond the {{acceptable}} standards of candor {{that it will be}} deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> its own choice. At least we do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great if the Federal Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. [...] The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of D. H. Lawrence seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable. But that no person in the United States should be allowed to do so {{seems to me to be}} intolerable, and violative of both the letter and spirit of the First Amendment.|$|E
500|$|Not {{everything}} she encounters is beautiful, however, and she juxtaposes her distaste for the German working class with her delight with French servants. Although politically liberal, Mary Shelley is aesthetically repelled by the Germans and therefore excludes them. Unlike the non-discriminating Claire Clairmont, Shelley feels <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> judgments {{of the scenes}} around her; Shelley writes that Claire [...] "on looking at this scene...exclaimed, 'Oh! this is beautiful enough; let us live here.' This was her exclamation on every new scene, and as each surpassed the one before, she cried, 'I am glad we did not stay at Charenton, but let us live here'". Shelley also compares herself positively to the French peasants who are unaware that Napoleon has been deposed. As scholar Angela Jones contends, [...] "Shelley {{may be said to}} figure herself as a more knowledgeable, disinterested English outsider capable of rendering impartial judgment"—an Enlightenment value.|$|E
500|$|Players {{customize}} {{their characters}} after the introductory mission. Player-character bodies, dress, and vehicles can be customized, {{as well as}} home properties. Players can additionally share their character designs in a Saints Row online community. Apart from the main story missions, there are optional diversions to make money and earn reputation, such as Insurance Fraud, where players hurt themselves in traffic to maximize self-injury before a timer expires, or Mayhem, where players maximize property destruction before a time expires. Some of these diversions were introduced in previous Saints Row games. Activities serve the plot and are positioned as training the player-character or damaging the Syndicate. They can also be repeated. Outside of structured diversions, players are <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their own fun by purchasing property, shopping for items, finding hidden sex doll and money cache collectibles, and wreaking unsolicited havoc. There are also [...] "flashpoint" [...] gang operations that grant respect when disrupted. Attacking others increases the player's notoriety level, as depicted with stars.|$|E

500|$|Having {{fulfilled}} his First National contract, Chaplin was <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{his first}} picture {{as an independent}} producer. In November 1922, he began filming A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers. Chaplin intended {{it to be a}} star-making vehicle for Edna Purviance, and did not appear in the picture himself other than in a brief, uncredited cameo. He wished for the film to have a realistic feel and directed his cast to give restrained performances. In real life, he explained, [...] "men and women try to hide their emotions rather than seek to express them". A Woman of Paris premiered in September 1923 and was acclaimed for its subtle approach, then an innovation. The public, however, seemed to have little interest in a Chaplin film without his presence, and it was a box office disappointment. The filmmaker was hurt by this failure – he had long wanted to produce a dramatic film and was proud of the result – and withdrew A Woman of Paris from circulation as soon as he could.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with CNN, Bennett said Lynton sits {{on the board of}} trustees of the RAND Corporation, which had asked Bennett to talk to Lynton and give his opinion on the film. Bennett felt The Interview was [...] "coarse" [...] and [...] "over the top", but that [...] "the depiction of Kim Jong-un was a picture that needed to get into North Korea. There {{are a lot of people}} in prison camps in North Korea who need to take advantage of a change of thinking in the north." [...] Bennett felt that if the DVD were smuggled into the country it might have an effect [...] "over time". Bennett contacted the Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues, a personal friend of his, who [...] "took the standard government approach: we don't tell industry what to do". Jen Psaki, a spokesperson for the United States Department of State, confirmed that Daniel R. Russel, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, had spoken to Sony executives; she reiterated that [...] "entertainers are <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> movies of their choosing, and we are not involved in that".|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} invoked {{responses from}} some {{cast and crew}} members from the series. Gareth Neame, the executive producer for the BBC was glad that the episode provoked debate, and the producers would adequately defend the episode from their research into making the story. That said Neame was also surprised {{by some of the}} responses, rationalising that those responders did not understand the context, and that it was not intended to offend anybody. Stephen Garrett, the director of Kudos Film and Television, the producer of Spooks agreed, further stating that the episode [...] "deals with very real stuff that's happening in the world. It touches nerves on a regular basis, and deals with uncomfortable truths." [...] Brenton meanwhile stated that [...] "people are <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> what they want of drama," [...] and believed the audience did not like the villains as they portrayed something disturbing in their culture, religion, world or profession. Oyelowo had said that the episode did not say that all Muslims are terrorists, only that some fanatics can give [...] "millions of good people a bad name." [...] The actor also believed that the Muslims who were [...] "up in arms" [...] about the story did not see the episode, but merely heard the basis of the plot and did not consider the Muslims in the episode who tried to stop the antagonists.|$|E
