50|$|Initially, <b>PBX</b> <b>systems</b> {{offered the}} primary {{advantage}} of cost savings for internal phone calls: handling the circuit switching locally reduced charges for telephone service via central-office lines. As <b>PBX</b> <b>systems</b> gained popularity, {{they began to}} feature services not available in the public network, such as hunt groups, call forwarding, and extension dialing. From the 1960s a simulated PBX known as Centrex provided similar features from the central telephone exchange.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an experimental evaluation of our scenario-based multithreading for real-time object-oriented models {{by the use}} of a case study of a Private Branch eXchange (<b>PBX)</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>PBX</b> <b>system</b> was taken from the industry and exhibits a number of characteristics found in real-world applications such as a highly reconfigurable dynamic structure and a typical layered architecture. The objective of this experimental study is to assess the improvements to 1) the modeling environment in terms of ease of use for designers and 2) the performance of the resultant executables. We show how our toolset was applied to the <b>PBX</b> <b>system</b> to model scenarios, as well as to generate a scenariobased multithreaded executable. The study clearly shows that our method can handle large-scale, complex models and that scenario-based multithreading achieves the performance improvements for a real-world model. ...|$|R

50|$|A mobile PBX is a hosted PBX {{service that}} extends {{fixed-line}} PBX functionality to mobile {{devices such as}} cellular handsets, smartphones and PDA phones by provisioning them as extensions. Mobile PBX services also can include fixed-line phones. Mobile <b>PBX</b> <b>systems</b> are different from other hosted <b>PBX</b> <b>systems</b> that simply forward data or calls to mobile phones by allowing the mobile phone itself, {{through the use of}} buttons, keys and other input devices, to control PBX phone functions and to manage communications without having to call into the system first.|$|R
50|$|Into the 21st century, the {{distinction}} between key <b>systems</b> and <b>PBX</b> <b>systems</b> has become increasingly blurred. Early electronic key systems used dedicated handsets which displayed and allowed access to all connected PSTN lines and stations. The modern key system now supports SIP, ISDN, analog handsets (in addition to its own proprietary handsets - usually digital) {{as well as a}} raft of features more traditionally found on larger <b>PBX</b> <b>systems.</b> Their support for both analog and digital signaling, and of some PBX functionality gives rise to the hybrid designation.|$|R
50|$|Virtual <b>PBX</b> <b>systems</b> or hosted <b>PBX</b> <b>systems</b> deliver <b>PBX</b> {{functionality}} as a service, available {{over the}} {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN) or the Internet. Hosted PBXs are typically {{provided by a}} telephone company or service provider, using equipment located in the premises of a telephone exchange or the provider's data center. This means the customer does not need to buy or install PBX equipment. Generally the service is provided by a lease agreement and the provider can, in some configurations, use the same switching equipment to service multiple hosted PBX customers.|$|R

40|$|This master's thesis {{deals with}} open source PBX {{security}} against security attacks. In the theoretical part is {{detailed description of}} problematic about attacks {{that could be used}} on VoIP systems with high focus on the Denial of Service attack. Furthermore are in theoretical part described methods of security of initialization protocol SIP. Individual chapter is devoted to intrusion detection and prevention of IDS and IPS systems, focusing on Snort and OSSEC. In the practical part of the work was created generator of attacks against various <b>PBX</b> <b>systems,</b> which was subsequently used for detailed testing. Special tests of <b>PBX</b> <b>system</b> are then used against DoS attacks, for which was created protection in form of active elements consisting of IDS Snort & OSSEC. These are capable to provide protection in real-time. The protection was tested on particular <b>PBX</b> <b>systems</b> and in matter of comparison were measured possibilities before and after of security implementation. The output of this work is attacks generator VoIPtester and creation of configuration rules for Snort and OSSEC...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Wireless {{communication}} plays a {{vital role}} in day to day life. Voice over IP (VoIP) {{is one of the most}} exciting new developments emerging within the telephony market. Wireless VoIP utilizes wireless LAN technology, the same wireless infrastructure used for the corporate network, in order to communicate. Traditional <b>PBX</b> <b>systems</b> can be replaced by IP <b>PBX</b> <b>system</b> in a cost effective way. Wireless IP phones can be used to access corporate telephony system as this technology combines the telephony function directly into an already existing data network infrastructure.
