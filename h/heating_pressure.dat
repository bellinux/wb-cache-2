40|$|A pull plug {{friction}} weld, simply defined, comprises {{inserting a}} rotating cone-shaped cylinder into a somewhat cone-shaped {{hole in a}} plate.

There are, however, technical and regulatory challenges converting a HPLC method to UHPLC making it difficult {{to take full advantage of}} UHPLC in regulatory-focused applications like quality control in pharmaceutical production. Using chromatographic modelling and fundamental theory, this thesis investigated method conversion between HPLC and UHPLC. It reports on the influence of temperature gradients due to viscous <b>heating,</b> <b>pressure</b> effects and stationary phase properties on the separation performance. It also presents a regulatory concept for less regulatory interaction for minor changes to approved methods to support efficient life cycle management. The higher pressure in UHPLC gave a retention increase of up to 40 % as compared to conventional HPLC while viscous heating, instead, reduced retention and the net result was very solute dependent. Selectivity shifts were observed even between solutes with similar structure when switching between HPLC and UHPLC and an experimental method to predict such selectivity shifts was therefore developed. The peak shape was negatively affected by the increase in pressure for some solutes since secondary interactions between the solute and the stationary phase increased with pressure. With the upcoming ICH Q 12 guideline, it will be possible for the industry to convert existing methods to UHPLC in a more flexible way using the deeper understanding and the regulatory concept presented here as a case example. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) provides a considerable increase in throughput compared to conventional HPLC and a reduced solvent consumption. The implementation of UHPLC in pharmaceutical analysis has accelerated {{in recent years and}} currently both instruments are used. There are, however, technical and regulatory challenges converting a HPLC method to UHPLC making it difficult to take full advantage of UHPLC in regulatory-focused applications like quality control in pharmaceutical production.

Flow field computations were performed at the test conditions and comparisons were made with the experimental data. Based on these comparisons, it is recommended that computational uncertainties on surface heating and pressure, for laminar, reacting-gas environments can be reduced to +/- 10 % and +/- 5 %, respectively. However, for flows with turbulence and shock-layer radiation, there were not sufficient validation-quality data obtained in this study to make any conclusions with respect to uncertainties, which highlights the need for further research in these areas...|$|E

All MAE factors affecting the extraction techniques (<b>heating,</b> <b>pressure,</b> power, time and solvent volume) of the targeted compounds were studied through experimental design to obtain a simple MAE method and evaluate the optimum extraction condition compared with traditional Soxhlet method for soil samples. The tested pesticide residues in the extracts of both techniques were analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). The results were compared for the percentage of recovery, time consumption and volume of organic solvent used in each extraction procedure. The results indicated that the MAE method had the advantages resulting from the use of a low volume of organic solvent (acetone: hexane, 3 : 2), an unnecessary cleanup step and good efficiency to extract different groups of pesticides in soils at residual levels in 20 min, this compared with Soxhlet method. All the compounds extracted by MAE method were recovered in good yields and Minimum Detection Limits (MDL) ranging from 0. 0001 to 0. 004 mg kg - 1.

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{approach has been}} developed whereby transient entry heating environments are reliably predicted based upon a limited set of benchmark radiative and convective solutions. <b>Heating,</b> <b>pressure</b> and shear-stress levels, non-dimensionalized by an appropriate parameter at each benchmark condition are applied throughout the entry profile. This approach was shown to be valid based on the observation that the fully catalytic, laminar distributions examined were relatively insensitive to altitude as well as velocity throughout the regime of significant heating. In order to establish a best prediction by which to judge the results that can be obtained using a very limited benchmark set, predictions based {{on a series of}} benchmark cases along a trajectory are used. Solutions which rely only on the limited benchmark set, ideally in the neighborhood of peak heating, are compared against the resultant transient heating rates and total heat loads from the best prediction. Predictions based on using two or fewer benchmark cases at or near the trajectory peak heating condition, yielded results to within 5 - 10 percent of the best predictions. Thus, the method provides transient heating environments over the heat-shield face with sufficient resolution and accuracy for thermal protection system design and also offers a significant capability to perform rapid trade studies such as the effect of different trajectories, atmospheres, or trim angle of attack, on convective and radiative heating rates and loads, pressure, and shear-stress levels...|$|E
