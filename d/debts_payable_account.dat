50|$|To {{compute the}} ratio, take the pro forma net income (same one {{used in the}} EPS figure {{mentioned}} above) and divide it by the invested capital. Invested capital can be estimated by adding together the stockholders equity, the total long and short term <b>debt</b> and <b>accounts</b> <b>payable,</b> and then subtracting accounts receivable and cash (all of these numbers {{can be found on}} the company's latest quarterly balance sheet).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} operating activities and financial and investment decisions in the start-up year on post-entry survival. Using a logit estimation of a funds flow model, we compare starters that failed within nine years with those that did not fail.

30|$|We {{also show}} {{that the impact of}} {{information}} asymmetry on debt financing decisions is moderated by firm size. The findings for the whole sample are mainly attributed to small firms, which are those that face more problems relating to information asymmetries. Thus, whereas in the small firm’s subsample we find evidence {{similar to that of the}} whole sample in relation to debt maturity, public debt, bank <b>debt</b> and <b>accounts</b> <b>payable,</b> we do not find this evidence in larger listed firms. This could be explained by larger firms being characterized by a more transparent information environment that diminishes the monitoring role of short-term debt and enhances the firm’s access to broader financing sources. Nevertheless, in large firms we do find an increase in the relative importance of trade credit within short-term financing sources as the degree of information asymmetry increases. However, in this case this effect could be attributed to the reduction in short-term bank debt, since the level of <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> is not affected by information asymmetry.|$|R
30|$|With {{regard to}} control variables, we obtain results {{consistent}} with prior evidence on financing determinants. Our findings show {{the relevance of}} collateral to obtain certain financial resources. TANG, our proxy for the firm’s collateral, is statistically significant {{in the majority of}} regressions. Prior research has reported a positive relationship between collateral and long-term debt (e.g. Bougheas et al. 2006), showing that collateral is an important determinant in the granting of credit, particularly for long-term loans conceded by financial institutions (e.g. Berger and Udell 1990). In our case, TANG is positively associated with public debt and bank-debt, basically with long-term bank debt, and negatively related to short-term <b>debt</b> and <b>accounts</b> <b>payable.</b> Therefore, our results suggest that those firms with more levels of collateralizable assets have more access to long-term financing and have less dependence on short-term financing, especially on financing provided by suppliers.|$|R
30|$|Once {{analyzed}} {{the influence of}} ASY on the term of the debt (short/long) {{and the type of}} market debt, public and private, we are interested in examining how information asymmetry influences the access to debt in the private debt market. In the subsequent analyses we study the association between ASY and bank debt, on one hand, and trade credit, on the other. We define our third dependent variable BNKDBT as the ratio of bank debt over total debt, and then we decompose BNKDBT into long-term and short-term bank debt. LNGBNK, our fourth dependent variable, is the ratio of long-term bank debt over total debt; SHTBNK, our fifth dependent variable, is the ratio of short-term bank debt to total debt; and ACCPAY, our sixth dependent variable, is the ratio of <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> to total <b>debt.</b> As a final analysis to examine in depth the firm’s choice of short-term financial sources under asymmetric information, we define our seventh dependent variable, TRDCRD, as the ratio of <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> to the sum of short-term bank <b>debt</b> plus <b>accounts</b> <b>payable.</b> Based on information asymmetry theories of trade credit, if firms with higher information asymmetries face bank credit rationing they will use more trade credit instead (Smith 1987; Biais and Gollier 1997). Thus, we expect negative coefficients on ASY in the BNKDBT, LNGBNK, and SHTBNK regressions, 6 as well as positive coefficients on ASY in the ACCPAY and TRDCRD regressions.|$|R

Its generalized use {{can lead to}} excessive enlargements of the payment periods and consequently can deteriorate the profitability of firms. In spite of the relevance of this problem there are few empirical researches. This work intends to fill this gap and {{to shed light on}} the factors related to the extension of trade credit. In the theoretical and empirical literature, different motives have been proposed to explain this issue: a mechanism to reduce transaction costs, a financial alternative to the bank system and an additional tool to improve commercial activities. To contrast these ideas a panel of 388 firms of the Spanish agrofood industry has been taken, and static and dynamic regression models have been estimated by using robust methods to heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation and endogeneity of the explanatory variables. The results confirm that trade credit receivable is associated with more active firms and with cheaper bank financing.

30|$|Going beyond prior studies, {{we focus}} on how the extent of {{information}} asymmetry affects short-term financing sources. Nevertheless, the choice between the two main sources of short-term financing (bank <b>debt</b> and <b>accounts</b> <b>payable)</b> may {{be determined by the}} existence of financial constraints in other sources of debt financing, as suggested by the previous descriptive analyses. In order to examine this issue, we first analyze the effects of information asymmetries on public debt, total bank debt, and long-term bank debt. As seen in columns 2 and 3 of Table  6, we find that ASY has a significant and negative relationship with PBLDBT and BNKDBT (at the 5 and 1 % levels, respectively). 8 These findings imply that those firms with more information asymmetry have more difficulties to issue market debt and to access bank financing. These findings are consistent with the evidence on US listed firms reported by Shen (2014), which suggests that firms with high levels of information asymmetry lose their access to the public debt market and have to rely on the private debt market. With regard to long-term bank debt (column 4), the coefficient on ASY is negative and non-significant at conventional levels in a two-tail test, although the negative association between ASY and LNGBNK would be statistically significant at the 10 % level in a one-tail test.|$|R
