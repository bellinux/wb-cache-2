Radiorespirometric measurements demonstrate an early and parallel respiration of glucose carbon atoms one and four in glucose-casein hydrolysate broth. It is concluded that the Entner-Doudoroff pathway performs an energetic role in glucose metabolism by T. intermedius with the pentose shunt and <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>pathways</b> functioning mainly in biosynthesis. The presence of thiosulfate in the growth medium inhibits the synthesis of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and related enzymes. In addition, both thiosulfate and glucose inhibit the synthesis of the Krebs cycle enzymes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-linked isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases. Thus, repression of enzymes is of significance in the adaptation of T. intermedius to its nutritional environment. The activity of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase of T. intermedius is inhibited by adenosine triphosphate.

Therefore, investigations focusing on this unique metabolism of L. reuteri may reveal a basis for new probiotic properties. For instance, L. reuteri may use reactive aldehydes and ketones as electron acceptors to balance their redox metabolism, which opens the possibility to exploit this bacterium for in vivo bioreduction of deleterious compounds in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Herein we demonstrate that L. reuteri ATCC 55730 cultures on glucose are able to use furfural (1 g/L), and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) (0. 5 g/L), as electron acceptors. The former enhances the growth rate by about 25 % and biomass yield by 15 %, whereas the latter is inhibitory. Furfural is stoichiometrically reduced to furfuryl alcohol by the culture. The conversion of furfural had no effect on the flux distribution between the simultaneously operating phosphoketolase and <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>pathways,</b> but initiated a flux to acetate production. In addition to furfural and HMF, cellular extracts showed potential to reoxidize NADH and/or NADPH with acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and diacetyl, indicating that conversion reactions take place intracellularly, however, utilization mechanisms for the latter compounds may not be present in this strain.

Starch breakdown was dependent upon inorganic phosphate and the 14 C-labeled intermediates formed were principally those of the <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>pathway</b> from glucose phosphate to glycerate 3 -phosphate. In addition, isotope was found in ribose 5 -phosphate and in maltose and glucose. The appearance of isotope in the intermediates of the <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>pathway</b> {{but not in the}} free sugars was dependent upon the inorganic phosphate concentration. Dithiothreitol shifted the flow of 14 C from triose-phosphate to glycerate 3 -phosphate. Iodoacetic acid inhibited starch breakdown and caused an accumulation of triose-phosphate. This inhibition of starch breakdown was overcome by ATP. The inhibitory effect of ionophore A 23187 on starch breakdown was reversed by the addition of magnesium ions. The formation of maltose but not glucose was impaired by the ionophore. The inhibition of starch breakdown by glycerate 3 -phosphate was overcome by inorganic phosphate. Fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate and ribose 5 -phosphate did not affect the rate of polysaccharide metabolism but increased the flow of isotope into maltose. Starch breakdown was unaffected by the uncoupler (trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), electron transport inhibitors (rotenone, cyanide, salicylhydroxamic acid), or anaerobiosis.

The purpose of this thesis was to understand the central and auxiliary metabolic pathways of L. panis PM 1 and to metabolically-engineer strain PM 1 based on the improved metabolic knowledge for industrial applications. The 16 S rRNA sequence and carbohydrate fermentation pattern were used to classify L. panis PM 1 as belonging to the group III lactobacilli; thus, strain PM 1 exclusively fermented glucose to lactate, acetate, and/or ethanol, clearly suggesting that its primary metabolism occurred via the 6 -phosphogluconate/phosphoketolase (6 -PG/PK) pathway. In contrast to typical group III lactobacilli, for fructose fermentation, L. panis PM 1 utilized both the 6 -PG/PK and the <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>pathways,</b> showing distinct strain-specific characteristics (more lactate, less acetate, no mannitol, and sporadic growth). In the PM 1 strain, auxiliary metabolic pathways governed end-product formation patterns along with central metabolism. Under aerobic conditions, a coupled NADH oxidase-NADH peroxidase system was a determinant for NAD+ regeneration and was regulated by oxygen availability; however, the accumulation of its major end-product, hydrogen peroxide, eventually resulted in oxidative stress. The citrate-to-succinate route was another important auxiliary pathway in L. panis PM 1. This route was directly connected to central energy metabolism, producing extra ATP for survival during the stationary phase, and was regulated by the presence of citrate, acetate, and succinate and a transcriptional repressor (PocR). Lactobacilli panis PM 1 produced 1, 3 -PDO via the glycerol reductive route; however, the absence of the glycerol oxidative route restricted the utilization of glycerol to solely that of electron acceptor. Lower ratio of glucose to glycerol, in combination with PocR, repressed the glycerol reductive route, resulting in less 1, 3 -PDO production. In an effort to metabolically engineer L. panis PM 1, an artificial glycerol oxidative pathway was introduced, and the engineered PM 1 strain successfully produced a significant amount of important platform chemicals, including 1, 3 -PDO, lactate, and ethanol, solely from TS.

We report the complete genome sequence of A. saccharovorans, which has permitted {{the prediction of}} genes for <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> and Entner-Doudoroff <b>pathways</b> and genes associated with the oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle. The electron transfer chain is branched with two sites of proton translocation and {{is linked to the}} reduction of elemental sulfur and thiosulfate. The genomic data suggest an important role of the order Acidilobales in thermoacidophilic ecosystems whereby its members can perform a complete oxidation of organic substrates, closing the anaerobic carbon cycle...|$|R
40|$|The rate of 3 HOH {{release from}} l 2 - 3 H]glucose {{was shown to}} be a valid measure of the rate of glucose {{consumption}} by testicular and ejaculated bovine sperm. The sensitivity of the tritium release method permits precise estimation of glucose consumption rates under conditions where {{only a small fraction of}} the total glucose is consumed whereas the classical glucose oxidase method is rather imprecise under these conditions. Ejaculated sperm contain sufficient quantities of hexokinase. phosphoglucoisomerase and aldolase to account for the observed whole cell glycolytic rates. The enzymes phosphoglucomutase, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were not detected in testicular or ejaculated bovine sperm. Thus, no correction for pentose cycle activity is required and the rate of glucose consumption is identical with flow of glucose through the <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> glycolytic <b>pathway.</b> Rates of glucose consumption and tritium release were not identical. A molar ratio for glucose consumed to 3 HOH released of 2. 25 was determined for bovine sperm cells over a wide range of glucose consumption rates. Isotope discrimination and extent of tritium exchange with the medium account for this difference. Mammalian sperm are highly dependent on the consumption of glucose or fructose fo...|$|R
