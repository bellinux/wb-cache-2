25|$|In the Internet of things, {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can {{decide whether or not}} that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of things, <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem. Just as standards {{play a key role in}} the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{most of the}} {{judiciary}} Denning firmly believed that the press {{should have access to}} the courts and freedom to criticise magistrates and judges. He believed all legal proceedings should be held in public, quoting Jeremy Bentham when he said that [...] "in the darkness of secrecy all sorts of things can go wrong. <b>If</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> really done in public {{you can see that the}} judge does behave himself, the newspapers can comment on it if he misbehaves— it keeps everyone in order".|$|E

What's fantastic about [...] was I was able to plan it while I was on another tour that was on a much smaller scale, opening for the Dolls. This is going to be, like, the ultimate creative orgasm for me 'cause I'm ready to move on. I'm not restricted to a certain structure for my show anymore. No limitations. I'm free. [...] I {{want to have a}} clear schedule of the dimensions for each venue so that we can properly execute all the technology and visuals. I need to mentally prepare days in advance <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> going to be taken out; otherwise, I won't have a good show...Every show's gonna be an A show by the time I'm done screaming at everyone– 'Hang it! Hang everything! Find a place to hang it!' That's gonna be my motto." ...|$|E

2500|$|Oktar also {{mentions}} {{that time is}} experienced by God as being a single event (or instant), and that time is already over. Time is captured in a single moment, by God, and thus God is outside of space and time, yet to human beings, it appears as <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> happening that are [...] "never before seen." [...] Accordingly, Oktar posits a philosophy where souls are already in heaven and hell, {{and that it is}} inappropriate to speak of the end of times as happening at a certain place and time, but that that time has already begun.|$|E

"Well," [...] he said, at last, [...] "this is sudden news, but <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> {{as bad as}} possible, and Fairclose and all {{the estate}} go, I shall be better off than many people.

60|$|Yes, my friends, {{this was}} the secret of Elijah's power. This is the lesson which Elijah has to teach us.
