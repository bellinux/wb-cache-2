40|$|An {{efficient}} manufacturing {{solution for}} aircraft primary structures is the liquid resin injection/infusion (LRI) process with non-crimp fabric (NCF). Nevertheless, {{the main drawback of}} non-crimp fabric and liquid resin systems versus {{state of the}} art unidirectional prepreg tape (UDPT) is their poor tolerance to low velocity impact (compression strength after impact for the same indentation depth). The influence of the matrix properties (resin system and interlaminar toughening) on the <b>impact</b> <b>tolerance</b> of quasi-isotropic laminate manufactured with biaxial non-crimp fabric is studied. None of the liquid resin systems considered increased the <b>impact</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the NCF-Iaminate. The <b>impact</b> <b>tolerance</b> of UDPT could only be achieved by reducing the most critical impact failure mechanisms, delamination, thanks to an interlaminar toughening concept {{in the form of a}} veil positioned between each fibrous layer.

40|$|<b>Impact</b> damage <b>tolerance</b> {{and damage}} {{resistance}} {{is a critical}} metric for application of polymer matrix composites where failure caused by impact damage could compromise structural performance and safety. As a result, several materials and/or design approaches to improve <b>impact</b> damage <b>tolerance</b> have been investigated {{over the past several}} decades. Many composite toughening methodologies impart a trade-off between increased fracture toughness and compromised in-plane strength and modulus. In large part, mechanical tests to evaluate composite damage tolerance include static methods such as Mode I, Mode II, and mixed mode failures. However, ballistic impact damage resistance does not always correlate with static properties. The intent {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the influence of a thermoplastic polyurethane veil interleave on the static and dynamic performance of composite test articles. Static coupon tests included tension, compression, double cantilever beam, and end notch flexure. Measurement of the resistance to ballistic impact damage were made to evaluate the composites response to high speed impact. The interlayer material showed a decrease of in-plane performance with only a moderate improvement to Mode I and Mode II fracture toughness.

To increase the <b>impact</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the composites, toughening agents like silica nanoparticles and rubber particles can be utilized to toughen the resin. To understand the effect of the particles enhancement, the <b>impact</b> <b>tolerance</b> was evaluated utilizing Compression After Impact (CAI) test after the impact induced by gas-gun impacting equipment. The results from CAI test after 20 J impact (high energy stone strike) shows about 30 % improvement in residual compressive strength for the nanosilica enhanced composite compared to unmodified CFRP.

With the diversity of international spacecraft, both manned and unmanned, planned to be in orbit in the future, a set of guidelines for berthing and docking subsystems is mandatory if servicing, resupply, and retrieval is to become practical on an international level. Successful interaction between these space systems and ground and/or space-based humans requires standardized and effective operational interface designs, {{particularly with respect to}} space grasping/berthing/docking interface mechanisms. This paper defines the spacecraft mechanical interfaces necessary to create a standard dynamic envelope for joining two free-flying spacecraft in a 'hard' berth or dock with each other in space. A review was made of past space flights and dynamics simulations dating back to 1962 to obtain necessary parameters and their values for successful manually controlled and autonomous spacecraft docking/berthing. The various spacecraft docking/berthing mechanisms and concepts are illustrated along with their dynamic capture and <b>impact</b> <b>tolerances</b> including maximum contact velocity along the approach axis and in the y-z plane; capture linear misalignment tolerances; and maximum capture roll, pitch, and yaw angles. From this data sets of recommended guidelines parameters were developed for autonomous and manual <b>impact</b> docking <b>tolerances,</b> non-impact grasping/berthing tolerances (end effectors), berthing contact conditions, and alignment tolerances after rigidizing. Also, detailed requirements were developed for mechanical design interface features, as well as latching, unlatching, and separation tolerances.

The composite specimens were ultrasonically inspected to determine their integrity before and after exposure to impact. Traditional low frequency (2. 25 to 10 megahertz) C-scan techniques evaluated an assortment of large composite panels which were made of several organic matrix resins including thermosets and a thermoplastic. After specimens were cut from these panels an ultrasonic microscope scanned them for cutting damage. After the composite specimens were impact loaded, they were again ultrasonically scanned. From the images, {{the extent of the}} damage was calculated and compared with the impact level.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{approach}} {{based on}} a displacement compatibility model is presented for both riveted and bonded stiffened composite panels containing impact damage. This repre-sents the first application of the displacement compatibility model to the failure analysis of impacted stiffened composite panels, and some new results are obtained for the <b>impact</b> dam-age <b>tolerance</b> properties of stiffened composite panels. In the present analysis, the previous displacement compatibility model for a stringer/orthotropic skin panel is improved for a stringer/unbalanced skin panel. The impact damage is simplified as an elliptic hole based on the compressive failure mechanisms of impacted composite laminates and stiffened panels. Predictions for failure loads and damage arrest capability agree well with experimental re-sults for several composite panel configurations. The important results obtained in this study are: (1) damage arrest capability {{is dominated by the}} strength of the skin/stringer attachment; (2) distinct two-stage failure shows that the riveted panels have significant damage arrest ca-pability due to the high shear strength of the rivets; and (3) since the very low shear strength of the skin/stringer attachment, the co-cured panels have no damage arrest capability.

Despite numerous experimental studies there are still disadvantages such as complex manufacturing process, relatively big damage area, difficult to repair and limit shape etc. Composite integral armour without all these problems is essential for the success of future main battle tank which has a total weight of only 20 tons. 3 D fabrics are seen as potential solution to poor <b>impact</b> damage <b>tolerance</b> of textile composites.

With their high elastic modulus, high strength, and capability of being tailored for a several applications, these materials offer definite advantages compared to more traditional structural materials.
