Extensive studies {{of such a}} fort at Finavon Hill near Forfar in Angus, {{using a variety of}} techniques, suggest dates for the destruction of the site in either the last two centuries or the mid-1st millennium. The lack of Roman artifacts (common in local souterrain sites) suggests that many sites were abandoned before the arrival of the legions.|$|E

However, unlike Kubah, parts of Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk {{remained}} censored until 2003.

5|$|A {{compound}} {{in the milk}} of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 {{has the potential to}} be a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.|$|E

5|$|As a countermeasure, {{cultures}} of the nematode Deladenus siricidicola {{have been used as}} biological control to protect trees since the 1980s. This parasite feeds on the mycelia of A.areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of wood wasp larvae. Where S.noctilio larvae are present, the parasite infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the nematode. This control method <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be relatively successful to combat the Sirex–Amylostereum complex. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the technique has been widely employed, reductions of parasitism levels of 70%–100% have been achieved.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the (2,0)-theory <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be {{important}} for studying the general properties of quantum field theories. Indeed, this theory subsumes many mathematically interesting effective quantum field theories and points to new dualities relating these theories. For example, Luis Alday, Davide Gaiotto, and Yuji Tachikawa showed that by compactifying this theory on a surface, one obtains a four-dimensional quantum field theory, {{and there is a}} duality known as the AGT correspondence which relates the physics of this theory to certain physical concepts associated with the surface itself. More recently, theorists have extended these ideas to study the theories obtained by compactifying down to three dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Of the two, lateral {{dynamics}} <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be {{the more}} complicated, requiring three-dimensional, multibody dynamic analysis {{with at least two}} generalized coordinates to analyze. At a minimum, two coupled, second-order differential equations are required to capture the principal motions. Exact solutions are not possible, and numerical methods must be used instead. Competing theories of how bikes balance can still be found in print and online. On the other hand, as shown in later sections, much longitudinal dynamic analysis can be accomplished simply with planar kinetics and just one coordinate.|$|E

Although parts of the codex are scattered across four libraries around the world, most of the manuscript is today vested in the British Library in London, where it is on public display. Since its discovery, study of the Codex Sinaiticus <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be useful to scholars for critical studies of biblical text.|$|E
5|$|The {{phonology}} {{of words}} <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> {{be beneficial to}} vocabulary development when children begin school. Once children have developed a vocabulary, they utilize the sounds that they already know to learn new words. The phonological loop encodes, maintains and manipulates speech-based information that a person encounters. This information is then stored in the phonological memory, a part of short term memory. Research shows that children's capacities {{in the area of}} phonological memory are linked to vocabulary knowledge when children first begin school at age 4–5 years old. As memory capabilities tend to increase with age (between age 4 and adolescence), so does an individual's ability to learn more complex vocabulary.|$|E
5|$|Unlike normal mice, {{transgenic}} poliovirus receptor (TgPVR) mice {{are susceptible}} to poliovirus injected intravenously or intramuscularly, and when injected directly into the spinal cord or the brain. Upon infection, TgPVR mice show signs of paralysis that resemble those of poliomyelitis in humans and monkeys, and the central nervous systems of paralyzed mice are histocytochemically {{similar to those of}} humans and monkeys. This mouse model of human poliovirus infection <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be an invaluable tool in understanding poliovirus biology and pathogenicity.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be {{by far the most}} hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E
5|$|Considered one of {{the preeminent}} figures of the classic horror film, the vampire <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be a rich subject for the film and gaming industries. Dracula is a major {{character}} in more films than any other but Sherlock Holmes, and many early films were either {{based on the novel}} Dracula or closely derived from it. These included the 1922 German silent film Nosferatu, directed by F. W. Murnau and featuring the first film portrayal of Dracula—although names and characters were intended to mimic Draculas, Murnau could not obtain permission to do so from Stoker's widow, and had to alter many aspects of the film. Universal's Dracula (1931), starring Béla Lugosi as the Count, was the first talking film to portray Dracula. The decade saw several more vampire films, most notably Dracula's Daughter in 1936.|$|E

5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, {{with the intent to}} provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E
