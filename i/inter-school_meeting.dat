50|$|Born in Luruaco, Atlántico Department {{and raised}} in Turbo, Antioquia, she {{initially}} {{took an interest in}} volleyball. She showed an aptitude for hurdling at an <b>inter-school</b> <b>meeting</b> in 1991, but remained more interested in the ball game and represented her municipality in the sport. By the time she went to university, however, she had not grown tall enough to be a professional volleyball player and decided to use her athletic speed for the 400 m hurdles instead. Having come from a poor family, her mother encouraged her to focus on her science studies rather than sport, but Oliveros combined the two as a student-athlete and she developed into a regional-class hurdler.|$|E
30|$|Following the within-school {{standardization}} meeting, “Inter-school sharing” {{meetings are}} organized by SBA District Coordinators. At {{the end of}} the school year, the SBA District Coordinator will organize an <b>inter-school</b> <b>meeting</b> for professional sharing among the schools within the group. The School Coordinators bring samples of video-recordings and assessment records to this <b>inter-school</b> <b>meeting</b> where these samples of student performance from different schools will be viewed and discussed with reference to the assessment criteria. Each School Coordinator needs to report back to colleagues in their own schools. If it is apparent that a particular school’s scores are markedly higher or lower as a whole than those from the other schools as a whole, the school team may wish to review their scores.|$|E

50|$|The Garston Campus {{partnership}} involves Saint Michael's Catholic High School and Parmiter's School, both {{of which}} are situated on High Elms Lane. <b>Inter-school</b> departmental <b>meetings</b> take place twice per academic year. The 14-19 St Alban's Consortium comprises St Michael's Catholic High School, Nicholas Breakspear School, St Albans Girls' School and Loreto College. The Consortium was formed in response to the government's Extended Schools initiative. Saint Michael's Catholic High School is the hub school for this group.|$|R
2500|$|When Aquinas {{opened in}} 1938, the {{brothers}} {{and students who}} made the move from the city also took the sporting records, achievements, and PSA membership of CBC Perth. In 1962, CBC Perth moved from St Georges Terrace to the riverside of East Perth and became Trinity College. When Trinity joined the PSA in 1968 the two schools immediately became arch-rivals with each school claiming the heritage of CBC Perth from 1894-1937. Meanwhile, there were no doubts {{in the minds of}} Aquinas students when the crowds at PSA <b>inter-school</b> athletics <b>meetings</b> shouted, [...] "Kill the Micks", they meant Aquinas and not Trinity, given the overwhelming dominance of Aquinas over the rest of the PSA competition.|$|R
30|$|The {{context for}} the present study is {{innovative}} in that the assessment tasks in this study involve speaking in a high-stakes language assessment context but they are designed and implemented in the ESL classroom by school teachers in light of a regular reading and viewing program or the elective modules integrated into the school curriculum (Gan 2013). The processes of selecting appropriate assessment tasks and making the actual assessments are undertaken collaboratively among teachers concerned, taking into account the students’ backgrounds, needs, and their skills. All the teachers involved in the assessment, however, need to go through a series of within-school and <b>inter-school</b> standardization <b>meetings</b> and discussions organized by the HKEAA to help them to develop a clear understanding of the shared expectations of what students at particular levels of performance {{should be able to do}} to achieve a certain grade.|$|R
