40|$|Abstract: The wide use of <b>Internet</b> <b>Service</b> in {{distributed}} computing and e-business {{has made the}} evolution of <b>Internet</b> <b>Service</b> {{to be one of}} the most prevalent research fields in software development domain. Traditional methods for software development cannot adapt to the challenge of <b>Internet</b> <b>Service</b> oriented software development. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for the evolution of <b>Internet</b> <b>Service</b> with active objects from the characteristics of <b>Internet</b> <b>Service</b> and principles of active objects.

40|$|With the {{development}} of mobile technologies, the use of mobile <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> has spread rapidly. The mobile internet can be considered from different perspective. Specifically, this dissertation studied mobile <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> from the customers 2 ̆ 7 perspective. To conduct this research {{in the specific context}} of service operations management (SOM), literature on service, quality, risk, satisfaction, and continuance intention as SOM research domains was reviewed. Moreover, six attributes of mobile <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> were identified; ubiquity, localization, personalization, reachability, convenience, and instant connectivity. ^ To examine research hypotheses, 400 questionnaires were distributed to Korean students attending universities in the Republic of Korea due to the highest national percentage of mobile <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> usage in the world. 367 questionnaires out of 400 were returned and the respond rate reached approximately 92 percent. Of 367 questionnaires, 316 data were usable. ^ Based on the results of this study, among attributes of mobile <b>internet</b> <b>service,</b> three attributes—ubiquity, reachability, and instant connectivity—were found to have significant effects on mobile <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> quality. As many previous studies have found, mobile <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> quality influenced customer satisfaction, which in turn affected continuance intention. Moreover mobile <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> quality also had a direct effect on continuance intention. Mobile internet risk did not affect mobile <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> quality, and also did not affect mobile <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> satisfaction and continuance intention, respectively. ^ One of the main contributions {{of this study is that}} the roles of mobile <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> quality and mobile <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> satisfaction are important factors in customers 2 ̆ 7 continuance intention with regards to mobile <b>internet</b> <b>service.</b> Service operations managers should consider mobile <b>internet</b> as a <b>service</b> rather than a technology. Moreover, they must understand mobile <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> quality and satisfaction from the customers 2 ̆ 7 perspective. ...|$|R
