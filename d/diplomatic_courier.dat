25|$|A {{number of}} {{suspected}} spies operating {{in or near}} Kristiania were investigated. Among the best known cases was the Rautenfels affair, when the German <b>diplomatic</b> <b>courier</b> Walter von Rautenfels was accused of leading a sabotage league {{with the purpose of}} attacking Allied ships. After a long investigation 188kg of explosives, in suitcases and packing cases, were confiscated at the railway station Oslo Ø. These included 95 larger and 12 smaller explosive bombs, 104 fire bombs, detonators and percussion caps. Due to diplomatic pressure Rautenfels was extradicted to Germany because of his immunity as courier for the German Emperor, while other members of the league were eventually convicted to prison.|$|E

500|$|Italy was {{the first}} country to {{recognise}} Afghanistan’s independence in 1919, and the Afghan government asked how it could thank Italy. Rome requested the right to build a chapel, which was being requested by international technicians then living in the Afghan capital. A clause giving Italy the right to build a chapel within its embassy {{was included in the}} Italian-Afghan treaty of 1921, and that same year the Barnabites arrived to start giving pastoral care. The actual pastoral work began in 1933 when the chapel international technicians had asked for was built. In the 1950s, the simple cement chapel was finished. On January 1, 1933, Fr. Egidio Caspani, CRSP, inaugurated the provisional chapel. [...] His appointment was a personal request of Pope Pius XI to the Barnabite Superior General. [...] Fr. Caspani had been the Rector of the Barnabite Seminary in Rome. [...] To accompany him on this journey one of his students was ordained and sent with him, not publicly as a priest, but as his <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>Courier</b> and assistant Chancellor at the Embassy. [...] Thus Mr. (really Fr.) Ernesto Cagnacci also began this new mission in Kabul. [...] "At the time the Catholic residents numbered in the hundreds, the majority of them in the capital, members of embassies or contractors employed by the Afghan Government of Afghanistan; others were dispersed throughout the country and were generally technicians and specialized workers, that lent their skills to the construction of various public works that marked the progress of the country." [...] In addition to his pastoral work, Fr. Caspani kept detailed notes of the politics, culture and geography of the land. [...] These observations were later published in an Italian volume published in collaboration with Fr. Cagnacci entitled, [...] "Afghanistan, crocevie dell'Asia". [...] Over the years a number of Barnabites have served as chaplains. [...] After Fr. Caspani there was: [...] Giovanni M. Bernasconi, 1947-1957; Raffaele Nannetti, 1957-1965; and Angelo Panigati, 1965 - 1990.|$|E

What follows is a grueling battle in which Fearless is crippled, but Sirius captain is sufficiently vexed by the damage inflicted by the small light cruiser that he turns Sirius about to ensure that she is destroyed.

In 1770–1771 he attended training courses at Izmaylovsky Regiment; these courses were the only instance of formal education in his life. Until 1775 Lvov, along with his military service that became a mere formality, was also employed by the Collegium of Foreign Affairs as a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>courier</b> and extensively travelled to German principalities and Denmark. In July 1775 Lvov resigned both military and civil service in the rank of captain {{and returned to his}} parents' estate, but one year later returned to diplomatic service.
