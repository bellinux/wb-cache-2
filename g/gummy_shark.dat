During this research, this shark was consistently detected at all depths from bottom to near surface whereas it was the substrate during the day.

500|$|Harmless to humans, the whiskery shark is fished commercially for its meat, {{which is}} sold fresh. It {{is one of}} the shark species marketed as [...] "flake". Along with the dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) and the <b>gummy</b> <b>shark</b> (Mustelus antarcticus), it is {{targeted}} by a shark fishery operating off Western Australia, currently managed as the Western Australian Joint Authority Southern Demersal Gillnet and Demersal Longline Fishery. The fishery began in the 1940s with a small number of demersal longline vessels, though the whiskery shark was not caught in substantial numbers until the 1970s, with the introduction of monofilament gillnets, hydraulic net haulers, and additional vessels. Catches peaked in the early 1980s, when 400–600 tons were taken annually. Overfishing reduced the population to <30% of pre-exploitation levels by the mid-1980s, prompting the Western Australian government to enact a management plan that stabilized the population at 25–30% of pre-exploitation levels.|$|E
2500|$|An {{opportunistic}} predator, the broadnose sevengill preys on a {{great variety}} of animals and has been found at a depth of [...] in offshore waters. It has been found to feed on sharks (including <b>gummy</b> <b>shark,</b> one of its main prey, and cowsharks), rays, chimaeras, cetaceans, pinnipeds, bony fishes and carrion and will also feed on whatever it finds such as shark egg cases, sea snails and remains of rats and humans. Research in 2003 found that its diet consisted of 30% mammals with a frequency of occurrence of 35%. It is a frequent top predator in shallow waters and has comb-like teeth, with the upper teeth having slender, smooth edged cusps to swallow small enough prey whole and lower teeth broad enough to bite prey to pieces. These sharks occasionally hunt in packs to take down larger prey, using tactics such as stealth to succeed. After feeding, it slowly digests the food for several hours and days and can go weeks until eating again. Large predatory sharks such as the great white shark can be a threat and cannibalism among this shark has also been recorded. When not highly active, it hunts stealthily while making very little movement except for moving its caudal fin until dashing to strike.|$|E

40|$|Worldwide, {{fisheries}} bycatch {{remains one}} of the greatest immediate threats to cetacean populations. In Australia, short-beaked common dolphins are subject to bycatch mortality in 2 fisheries: the purse-seine fishery for sardines off central South Australia and the gillnet fishery for <b>gummy</b> <b>sharks</b> off southern Australia. The cumulative impact of bycatch from both fisheries on the dolphin population(s) in these regions are unknown. We used information from microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA to investigate population genetic structure and estimate contemporary migration rates in 332 biopsied and 15 stranded samples of common dolphins. Samples were collected from 11 locations along ~ 3500 km of coastline in southern and southeastern Australia. Bayesian and traditional analyses of population genetic structure revealed the presence of at least 6 management units of common dolphins, of which a minimum of 3 are potentially impacted by the 2 fisheries. These management units need to be managed separately for conservation purposes and for monitoring and mitigation of common dolphin fishery interactions off southern and southeastern Australia. We suggest that substructuring and migratory movements of common dolphins across these regions may be driven by spatial variations in oceanography, upwelling events and/or fish distribution. This study exemplifies how information on genetic substructuring in a neritic top predator can be valuable for fisheries bycatch management. 15 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Predators play {{a crucial}} role in the {{structure}} and function of ecosystems. However, the magnitude of this role is often unclear, particularly for large marine predators, as predation rates are difficult to measure directly. If relevant biotic and abiotic parameters can be obtained, then bioenergetics modelling offers an alternative approach to estimating predation rates, and can provide new insights into ecological processes. We integrate demographic and ecological data for a marine apex predator, the broadnose sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus, with energetics data from the literature, to construct a bioenergetics model to quantify predation rates on key fisheries species in Norfolk Bay, Australia. We account for the uncertainty in model parameters by incorporating parameter confidence through Monte Carlo simulations and running alternative variants of the model. Model and parameter variants provide alternative estimates of predation rates. Our simplest model estimates that ca. 1130 ± 137 N. cepedianus individuals consume 11, 379 (95 % CI: 11, 111 - 11, 648) <b>gummy</b> <b>sharks</b> Mustelus antarcticus (~ 21 tonnes) over a 36 -week period in Norfolk Bay, which represents a considerable contribution to total predation mortality on this key fishery species. This study demonstrates how the integration of ecology and fisheries science can provide information for ecosystem and fisheries management...|$|R
40|$|Dietary {{information}} of apex predators {{is crucial to}} understanding community dynamics and ecosystem processes. However, as dietary studies traditionally involve lethal sampling, obtaining this essential information can have repercussions on predator populations and the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. With stronger emphasis being placed on conservation of species that are vulnerable to overexploitation, the need for non-destructive methods of sampling is imperative, as is the requirement to maximize the information obtained from each sample. Stomach flushing (gastric lavage) and DNA analysis of stomach contents methods were tested on the broadnose sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus Peron 1807. Acoustic tracking and recaptures of sharks implied high survivorship post-fishing and stomach flushing. From 85 prey items collected, 36 (43 %) could be identified to species level using morphological analysis. After DNA analysis, a further 35 items were identified to species level, doubling the information obtained from these stomachs. The number of N. cepedianus that were confirmed to have eaten <b>gummy</b> <b>sharks</b> Mustelus antarcticus Gunther 1870 also doubled after DNA analysis. Without DNA analysis (of stomach contents) the importance of M. antarcticus in the diets of N. cepedianus would have been substantially underestimated. In addition, the non-lethal approach provides an opportunity to obtain meaningful information from non-harvested, endangered or rare species or sampling of species within protected areas...|$|R

40|$|Most sharks, {{rays and}} chimaeras (chondrichthyans) taken in {{commercial}} fisheries are discarded (i. e. {{returned to the}} ocean either dead or alive). Quantifying the post-capture survival (PCS) of discarded species is therefore essential for the improved management and conservation of this group. For all chondrichthyans taken in the main shark fishery of Australia, we quantified the immediate PCS of individuals reaching the deck of commercial shark gillnet fishing vessels and applied a riskbased method to semi-quantitatively determine delayed and total PCS. Estimates of immediate, delayed and total PCS were consistent, being very high for the most commonly discarded species (Port Jackson shark, Australian swellshark, and spikey dogfish) and low for the most important commercial species (<b>gummy</b> and school <b>sharks).</b> Increasing gillnet soak time or water temperature significantly decreased PCS. Chondrichthyans with bottom-dwelling habits had the highest PCS whereas those with pelagic habits had the lowest PCS.

40|$|Despite their {{prominence}} as {{species of}} great interest and conservation significance, currently our understanding of shark movement patterns and their ecological role as predators on small Odontocete populations is far from complete. The first component of my research investigated the movement patterns of the four main commercial species (sandbar, Carcharhinus plumbeus; dusky, Carcharhinus obscurus; whiskery, Furgaleus macki; gummy, Mustelus antarcticus) and several species occasionally caught {{off the coast of}} Western Australia (Chapter 2). I analysed long-term (1994 to 2013), conventional tagging data collected by the Department of Fisheries, Western Australia to provide a detailed account of observed movement patterns. The second component of my research investigated the predatory role of sharks on bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) off Bunbury, Western Australia (Chapter 3). I examined the prevalence of shark bites on systematically photographed dolphins over an eight year period (2007 to 2014). I also attempted to identify the shark species responsible for the attacks by seeking the expert opinions of three independent reviewers on the bite marks. The analyses of movement patterns from the long-term tagging data (Chapter 2) found mean displacements of < 250 km for the four main commercial species. However, occasional displacements of more than 2, 000 km were also observed for all four species. Displacement was positively correlated with time at liberty, size (fork length) and release condition. The swimming speed varied significantly between species, with faster movements observed for larger Carcharhinid sharks. Furthermore, significant differences in sex ratios at release and recapture were observed for <b>gummy</b> and whiskery <b>sharks.</b> A significantly higher proportion of females were released and recaptured for both species. Although, fork length was found to significantly vary for non-recaptured and recaptured sandbar and dusky sharks, results from the analyses were disregarded due to bias gear-selectivity and inaccurate measurements reported by fishermen. The highest recapture frequency for all other species occasionally caught was less than ten. Maximum displacements ranged from 0. 70 to 1, 143 km, these displacements were observed by wobbegongs (Orectolobus sp.) and copper whaler (Carcharhinus brachyurus) sharks, respectively. Maximum time at liberty ranged from 4 to 5, 245 days for nervous (Carcharhinus cautus) and tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier) sharks, respectively. The estimated maximum swimming speed for occasionally caught species peaked at 0. 42 km/hr for copper whaler (Carcharhinus brachyurus) sharks. Swimming speeds for all other species were less than 0. 03 km/hr. No statistical analyses were completed for these species. Analyses of the prevalence of external injuries believed to have been inflicted by sharks (Chapter 3) found that the total bite mark frequencies of systematically photographed dolphins varied significantly among age classes (calves, juveniles, adults) with the highest frequency of injuries sustained by adults (X 2 = 38. 436, P = < 0. 001). Bite frequencies did not differ significantly between sexes or between mothers with or without calves (X 2 = 0. 111, P = 0. 738; X 2 = 1. 316, P = 0. 251, respectively). The total frequency of shark bites was significantly lower in the austral autumn and winter months than {{in the spring and summer}} (X 2 = 15. 333, P = 0. 002). However, the frequency of fresh injuries was higher in the summer of 2013 (n = 8), than in other seasons (range = 0 - 1). When the data for 2013 were removed from the seasonal analyses the frequency of bites in summer (pooled over years) was higher but not significantly (X 2 = 3. 889, P = 0. 274). The total frequency of injuries did not significantly differ among years (2008 – 2013) (X 2 = 4. 948, P = 0. 422). After evaluating the photographed bite marks on dolphins, three independent reviewers suggested that the shark species responsible for the injuries were most likely white (Carcharodon carcharias), tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier), and several smaller Carcharhinid species (e. g., bull, Carcharhinus leucas; whaler, Carcharhinus brachyurus; dusky, Carcharhinus obscurus). The results from Chapter 2 of the study provide a complete and meaningful representation of the movement patterns for the four main commercial species (sandbar, Carcharhinus plumbeus; dusky, Carcharhinus obscurus; whiskery, Furgaleus macki; and gummy, Mustelus antarcticus) and several species occasionally caught off Western Australia. The described movement patterns presented in this study can be incorporated into future conservation and management plans increasing their effectiveness and precision, ensuring west Australian shark stocks remain at target thresholds. The results from Chapter 3 refine our understanding of the interactions between sharks and small living Odontocetes (i. e., bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus). The results from the research confirm that sharks not only scavenge but actively hunt and predate living bottlenose dolphins. The ability and significant influence of these predatory sharks to shape and alter dolphin population dynamics is likely to be more important than previously recognised...|$|R
