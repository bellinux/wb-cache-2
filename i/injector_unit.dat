40|$|Automated test {{capability}} for extensive low-level hardware fault insertion testing is developed. The test capability {{is used to}} calibrate fault detection coverage and associated latency times as relevant to projecting overall system reliability. Described are modifications made to the NASA Ames Reconfigurable Flight Control System (RDFCS) Facility to fully automate the total test loop involving the Draper Laboratories' Fault <b>Injector</b> <b>Unit.</b> The automated capability provided included the application of sequences of simulated low-level hardware faults, the precise measurement of fault latency times, the identification of fault symptoms, and bulk storage of test case results. A PDP- 11 / 60 served as a test coordinator, and a PDP- 11 / 04 as an instrumentation device. The fault injector was controlled by applications test software in the PDP- 11 / 60, rather than by manual commands from a terminal keyboard. The time base was especially developed for this application to {{use a variety of}} signal sources in the system simulator...|$|E
40|$|Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and its {{contractors}} {{have developed}} a conceptual design for a directional microborehole drilling system for hard-rock boring. Analytical calculations, simulations, {{and the results of}} laboratory testing of critical prototype drilling components have influenced the design. Two reduced-size drilling systems to produce small diameter, 500 -ft-long, directionally drilled river crossing trajectories are proposed to prove feasibility of the concept: (1) a 2 - 1 / 4 -in. diameter, early demonstration unit to drill directional ultraslimholes; and (2) a 1 - 1 / 8 -in. diameter, ultimate design to drill directional microboreholes. Both concepts use versatile, coiled-tubing-deployed, hydraulically-powered drilling assemblies, and a surface platform that includes a tubing <b>injector</b> <b>unit</b> to develop high load insertion (snubbing) of the tubing into the sealed borehole. Surface injection will be used to develop the required bit thrust, and both concepts provide for the use of a commercial, real-time, location and steering system that is readily and routinely adapted for deployment on a coiled-tubing drilling platform. The conceptual drilling platform and its subassemblies are shown...|$|E

40|$|Impinging jet {{injectors}} {{are often}} used in rocket propulsion systems, where storable liquid propellants shall be feeded. Also for gelled fuels and propellants this injector type is interesting due to its simplicity and relatively small contact areas between gel and injector housing compared to many other injector types. Gelled propellants are shear thinning fluids and show a significantly different rheological behaviour than Newtonian fluids. During storage and transport conditions with very low shear stress values their viscosity is very high and often combined with a distinct yield stress {{so that they are}} often described as semi-solid. During the feeding process through pipes and injectors, the structure of the gel is being destroyed, which leads to a decrease of viscosity up to its liquefaction inside the <b>injector</b> <b>unit.</b> Various experimental and theoretical investigations about the impinging jet injector processes with gelled propellants have been conducted in the past years and have shown that impinging jet injectors are interesting candidates for real engine applications. Up to now there are still gaps to be closed in the understanding of the working behaviour of impinging jet injectors with gelled fuels. The aim of the present publication is to present the results of an investigation concerning the influence of the interior injector inlet angle on the feeding process and spray behaviour of three different gelled fuels. For this task pressure loss measurements as well as shadowgraph images have been used to characterize the injection process...|$|E
40|$|WO 2003051770 A UPAB: 20030808 NOVELTY - In {{a process}} to {{generate}} hydrogen gas for a fuel cell, non-polar hydrocarbons are reformed to supercritical water, in a first stage water is compressed in a compression zone to a pressure p 1. The water is discharged to a heating zone and brought to a temperature t 1. The water is in a supercritical state at pressure p 1 and temperature t 1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Hydrocarbon fuel is compressed to pressure p 1 and fed to the supercritical water to form a supercritical mixture of water and hydrocarbon. The mixture reacts in a supercritical reaction zone {{in the presence of}} a granular oxide catalyst, forming CO, CO 2 and H 2, and is allowed to cool to a sub-critical state at temperature t 2 with pressure falling to p 2 in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Gas is separated from the liquid. Some or all of the residual liquid is returned to the compression zone and the cycle repeated. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for: (1) the use of hydrogen to reform non-polar hydrocarbons to supercritical water in the presence of hydrocarbons and a reforming assembly; and (2) an assembly consisting of a high pressure water pump, a water heater, a high pressure hydrocarbon pump, a hydrocarbon <b>injector</b> <b>unit,</b> a heated regeneration reactor, a product chilling unit, a product expansion valve, a phase separator, and liquid feedback pipe.
