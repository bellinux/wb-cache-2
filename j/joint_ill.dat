6000|$|From half-past eight till six, he must [...] "file {{and chip}} vigorously in a {{moleskin}} suit and infernally dirty." [...] The work was {{not new to}} him, for he had already passed some time in a Genoese shop; and to Fleeming no work was without interest. Whatever a man can do or know, he longed to know and do also. [...] "I never learned anything," [...] he wrote, [...] "not even standing on my head, but I found a use for it." [...] In the spare hours of his first telegraph voyage, to give an instance of his greed of knowledge, he meant [...] "to learn the whole art of navigation, every rope in the ship, and how to handle her on any occasion"; and once when he was shown a young lady's holiday collection of seaweeds, he must cry out, [...] "It showed me my eyes had been idle." [...] Nor was his {{the case of the}} mere literary smatterer, content if he but learn the names of things. In him, to do and to do well was even a dearer ambition than to know. Anything done well, any craft, despatch, or finish, delighted and inspired him. I remember him with a twopenny Japanese box of three drawers, so exactly fitted that, when one was driven home, the others started from their places; the whole spirit of Japan, he told me, was pictured in that box; that plain piece of carpentry was as much inspired by the spirit of perfection as the happiest drawing or the finest bronze, and he who could not enjoy it in the one was not fully able to enjoy it in the others. Thus, too, he found in Leonardo's engineering and anatomical drawings a perpetual feast; and of the former he spoke even with emotion. Nothing indeed annoyed Fleeming more than the attempt to separate the fine arts from the arts of handicraft; any definition or theory that failed to bring these two together, according to him, had missed the point; and the essence of the pleasure received lay in seeing things well done. Other qualities must be added; he was the last to deny that; but this, of perfect craft, was at the bottom of all. And on the other hand, a nail ill driven, a <b>joint</b> <b>ill</b> fitted, a tracing clumsily done, anything to which a man had set his hand and not set it aptly, moved him to shame and anger. With such a character, he would feel but little drudgery at Fairbairn's. There would be something daily to be done, slovenliness to be avoided, and a higher mark of skill to be attained; he would chip and file, as he had practised scales, impatient of his own imperfection, but resolute to learn.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problems of}} 3 D reconstruction, pose estimation and object classification, from a single 2 D image. In sharp contrast with {{state of the art}} methods that solve each of these problems separately or iteratively, we propose a mathematical framework that solves these problems jointly and simultaneously. Since the <b>joint</b> problem is <b>ill</b> posed unless “prior knowledge ” is considered, the proposed framework incorporates “prior knowledge ” about the 3 D shapes of different object classes. This knowledge is used to define a function L(H) that encodes how well each hypothesis H (object class and pose) “explains ” the input image. To efficiently maximize L(H) without having to exactly evaluate it for each hypothesis H, we propose a H&B algorithm that computes and refines upper and lower bounds for L(H) at a much lower cost. In this way suboptimal hypotheses are disregarded with little computation. The resulting algorithm integrates information from the 2 D image and the 3 D prior, is efficient, and is guaranteed to find the optimal solution. 1...|$|R

Therefore, analysis of the complex behavior of the implant in the human body is a fundamental problem of biomechanics of implants. This issue is dedicated, this dissertation thesis. Dissertation thesis deals with the solution design and development of experimental device for testing the TEP acetabula and wear identification using optical method. The proposed device allows the joint burden hole TEP physiological manner, but by working with the acetabulum burdened by Power resultant joint axis passes through the hole. The physiological loading of articular wells and evaluating the size of the loss of polyethylene is currently intensively addressed. The results of this study may in the near future, serving as information for assessing the conduct of wear prosthetic hip joint in vivo. The work is devoted to solving the problem of the size required to detect the loss of polyethylene for joint replacement arthroplasty: Design and development of experimental equipment for testing the acetabulum of the hip joint arthroplasty. Identify wear using optical methods. Design and development of experimental equipment was made in the system Inventor Professional 2010 at the level of 3 D modeling. Great attention was paid to the design fit into the acetabulum TEP testing machines and gripping the acetabulum into an optical device. Management options were tested with combinations of experimental equipment engines. Suggestions were made and then tests for fixing the acetabulum into an optical device. Has the possibility of depth analysis and identification of wear joined with innovative solutions to evaluate the loss of polyethylene acetabulum arthroplasty. Identification of abrasion (loss of polyethylene) joint arthroplasty holes were carried out experimental measurements using an optical holographic interferometry. The comprehensive analysis of the results of experimental measurement of the loss of polyethylene shows that this method can identify both the size but also an area where there is even to small changes in the surface, which depend on the abrasion. One can also say that using this method we are able to affect the will or displacements that affect the size of the loss of polyethylene in joint arthroplasty hole. Despite the number of known and lessons learned arising from the results of solving the problem of design and development of experimental equipment for testing the acetabulum and hip arthroplasty wear identification using optical methods, this work is that the initial study to identify problematics wear of joint replacements.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the causes of}} non-traumatic arthritides and their outcome In patients admitted tu a national referral hospital. Prospective study of all consecutive admissions with joint symptoms as the primary disorder or in whom the joint disorder {{was one of the}} presenting problems. Study period. I May to 31 December. 1992. Muhimhili Medical Centre. Oar es Salaam. Tanzania. 120 patients: 78 male. 42 female. One percent of all medical and orthopaedic admissions during the study period were due to rheumatic diseases. The mean age of the patients was 36) 'c';lr:-; (r~ 1 I 1 gl' ~- 76 years). There were more males (78 (65. 0 %» than females (42 (3). 0 %» (p = 0. 000). Seventy nine (6). 9 %) patients were between 11 and 40 years of age. The rheumatic disorders seen in descending order of frequency were: HIV arthropathy 32 (26. 7 %). rheumatoid arthritis 20 (16. 7 %), septic arthritis 17 (14. 2 %). Reiter's disease 14 (I I. 6 %), gout 7 (5. 8 %). osteoarth rit is 7 (5. 8 %). acute rheumatic fever 3 (2. 7 %), palindrornic rheumatism 3 (2. 7 %). haernarth rns is 2 (I. 7 %). h ypertroph ic pulmonary osteoarth ropath y 2 (I. 7 %). systemic lupus erythematosus I (0. 8 %), psoriatic arthropathy I (0. 8 %). leukaemia I (0. 8 %) and tuberculous arthritis I (0. 8 %). In 9 (7. 5 %) patients no definite diagnosis was made. More males than females suffered from H IV arthropathy and Reiter's disease. the male: female rat io being 2 : I and 3 : I respectively. More females than males suffered rrorn rheumatoid arthritis. osteuarthritis. palindromic rheumatism and acute rheumatic fever though the differences were not statistically significant. IX The mean age of patients with Reiter's disease was lowest (26 years) while till'. highest was of patients suffering from osreoarthritis (59. 5 years). The IllL~, 1 I 1 ages of patients suflering from HIV arthropathy and rheumatoid arthritis were almost similar, 35 and 34 years respectively. The youngest patient (8 years) suffered from septic arthritis while the oldest patient (76 years) suffered from HIV arthropathy. It was not possible to determine statistical associations between various rheumatic diseases and smoking, occupation, level of education and bully m,ISS index because of the small number of patients seen in each diagnostic category. Ninety-eight (81. 7 %) patients presented to the hospital after th ree weeks had passed since the onset of symptoms, wh i I e 22 (18. 3 %) had an acute presentation. In only 5 (4. 2 %) patients was there evidence of familial clustering of rheumatic diseases. The kneejoint was involved in 102 (85 %) patients while the ankle joint was involved in 42 (35 %) patients. The wrist was the commonest <b>joint</b> involved <b>ill</b> the upper limbs. being involved in 34 (28. 3 %) patients. The proximal interphalangealjoints were involved in 31 (25. 8 %) patients. III HIV arthropathy, 17 (53. 1 %) patients had ol igoarticular involvement of the joints while 8 (25. 0 %) presented with polyarthritis and 7 (21. 9 %) had monuartluitis. Fourteen (82. 4 %) patients with septic arthritis had a peripheral leucocyte count above 10, 000 cells/crnm. In only tour patients was it possible to isolate the causative organisms from the synovial fluid. There were two patients in whom beta-haemolytic streptococci were cultured. one had Streptococcus pyogenes infection and in the fourth Klebsiella species was found The extra-articular features in HIV arthropathy included lymph node enlargement (13 / 32), pustular skin lesions (2 / 32) and splenomegaly (2 / 32). The complications and extra-articular features in patients with rheumatoid arthritis were muscle wasting (3 / 20). ulnar deviation of fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joints (3 / 20), vascul itic lesions (2 / 20), lymph nude enl. ngement (2 / 20). splenomegaly (2 / 20) and hepatomegaly (2 / 20). Only one patient with rheumatoid arthritis had skin nodules. x Conclusion Eighty three (69. 2 %) of the 120 patients were unable to perform normal duties while 12 (10 %) were able to carry out normal activities on admission. On discharge. 71 (60. 1 %) out of 118 patients were unable to perform normal duties while 37 (31. 4 %) were able to perform normal activities. One hundred and two (86. 4 %) patients were followed up after 5. 8 months utter discharge. 01 these 64 (62. 7 %) were able to perform normal duties. 28 (27. 4 %) were unable to work and 3 (2. 9 %) were severely incapacitated. There were 7 (6. 9 %) deaths: two in patients with HIV arthropathy, two in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. and three in patients. one each having acute rheumatic fever. leukaemia and systemic lupus erythematosus. There were 82 patients in whom the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale was completed at follow up. Ten (12. 2 %) patients were unable to use public transpon. f (6. 0 %) needed help in doing household activities, 4 (4. 9 %) were completely unable to do household activities. Three (3. 6 %) patients were unable {{to take care of themselves}} (needing help in washing and going to the tu iI et). The rheumatic diseases seen in developed countries are also encountered in medical practice in developing countries like Tanzania. affecting people in the productive years of life. While the prevalence of some rheumatic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis may. at present. be low. others like HIV arthropathy are likely to he seen with increasing frequency.
