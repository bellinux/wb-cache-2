5|$|After {{entering}} Princeton, the Americans {{began to}} loot the abandoned British supply wagons {{and the town}} itself. With news that Cornwallis was approaching, Washington <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> leave Princeton. Washington wanted to push onto New Brunswick and capture a British pay chest of 70,000 pounds but Major Generals Henry Knox and Nathanael Greene talked him out of it. Instead, Washington moved his army to Somerset Courthouse {{on the night of}} January 3, then marched to Pluckemin by January 5, and arrived at Morristown, by sunset the next day, for winter encampment. After the battle, Cornwallis abandoned many of his posts in New Jersey, and ordered his army to retreat to New Brunswick.|$|E
5|$|Lampard {{then put}} Chelsea 3–2 ahead, but Hargreaves {{levelled}} {{things up with}} a shot into the top corner. Ashley Cole was the next up, and Van der Sar got a strong hand to the ball but could not keep it out. Nani then <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> score to keep United in it, and he did, leaving it up to John Terry to win the cup for Chelsea; however, Terry lost his footing when planting his standing foot by the ball, and, even though Van der Sar was sent the wrong way, Terry's mis-hit effort struck {{the outside of the}} right post and went wide.|$|E
25|$|The Navajo headman Narbona {{had heard}} of Hinojos's advance, <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come through the pass to reach the Canyon de Chelly, and had {{carefully}} prepared an ambush by about 250 warriors.|$|E

25|$|At some point, McCroskey used {{a digital}} camera to record a video of himself, {{according}} to Ennis. In the video, he indicated that he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay {{for what he had}} done and contemplated suicide, Ennis said.|$|E
25|$|The next day, {{when the}} Umayyad forces did not renew the battle, the Franks feared an ambush. Charles at first {{believed}} that the Umayyad forces were trying to lure him {{down the hill and}} into the open. This tactic he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> resist at all costs; he had in fact disciplined his troops for years to under no circumstances break formation and come out in the open.|$|E
25|$|Baldwin {{resigned}} and MacDonald again formed a minority government, at first with Lloyd George's cordial support. This time MacDonald <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on domestic matters. Arthur Henderson became Foreign Secretary, with Snowden {{again at the}} Exchequer. JH Thomas became Lord Privy Seal with a mandate to tackle unemployment, assisted by the young radical Oswald Mosley. MacDonald appointed the first ever woman cabinet minister Margaret Bondfield as Minister of Labour.|$|E

But he did it, and just in time he crawled into the old stone wall {{on one side of}} the orchard, while Bowser the Hound barked his {{disappointment}} to the moon.|$|R
25|$|Although Thomas's {{forces were}} much stronger, {{he could not}} ignore Hood's army. Despite the severe beating it had {{suffered}} at Franklin, Hood's Army of Tennessee presented a threat by its mere presence and ability to maneuver. Thomas <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> attack, but he prepared cautiously. His cavalry corps, commanded by the energetic young Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson, was poorly armed and mounted, {{and he did not}} want to proceed to a decisive battle without effective protection of his flanks. This was particularly important, since Wilson would be facing the horsemen of the formidable Forrest. Refitting the Union cavalry took time.|$|E
25|$|Coulon {{moved his}} troops into the woods, within easy musket {{range of the}} fort. Washington <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{dislodge}} the Canadians and Indians from that position, so he ordered an assault with his entire force across the open field. Seeing the assault coming, Coulon ordered his soldiers, led by Indians, to charge directly at Washington's line. Washington ordered the men to hold their ground and fire a volley. Mackay's regulars obeyed Washington's command, and supported by two swivel cannons, they inflicted several casualties on the oncoming Indians. The Virginians, however, fled back to the fort, leaving Washington and the British regulars greatly outnumbered. Washington ordered a retreat back to the fort.|$|E
25|$|Double world {{champion}} Alain Prost's McLaren {{had been having}} problems all weekend with the Frenchman finding the McLaren MP4/5 hard to set up, and when his two stop strategy was ruined by a clutch failure, he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> continue the race having made just one of his scheduled two pit stops on the notoriously abrasive Rio circuit. He finished second. Nigel Mansell secured a surprising win for the Scuderia, with no problems despite ongoing gearbox faults all weekend {{and a lack of}} winter testing (Mansell also had the steering wheel come loose on the back straight and had to have it changed in his final stop, which luckily was scheduled for the end of that lap). The final step of the podium was taken by local Maurício Gugelmin. Grand Prix debutant Johnny Herbert, Derek Warwick and Alessandro Nannini scored the remaining points. Warwick was desperately unlucky. He lost over 20 seconds in a slow pit stop and only finished 17.8 seconds behind Mansell at the finish suggesting a win (which would have been both his and Arrows' first) or podium place had gone begging.|$|E

500|$|Dutton {{felt that}} the Rangers were {{responsible}} for the league's refusal to allow the Americans to resume operations, and in a fit of pique, swore that the Rangers would never win another Stanley Cup in his lifetime. His vow became known as [...] "Dutton's Curse". Additionally, he never set foot in an NHL arena again until 1980 when, as the last surviving Calgary Tiger, he was asked to drop the puck for the ceremonial faceoff prior to the first game in Calgary Flames' history. Dutton's 34-year separation from the NHL was attributed to the betrayal of the league's owners, but also because Dutton himself found the lure of the game too strong, and <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> step away in order to effectively manage his businesses.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's meticulous {{planning}} {{may also}} have extended to the timing of his operation, and even his choice of attire, according to Kaye's research team. [...] "The FBI searched but couldn't find anyone who disappeared that weekend," [...] Kaye wrote, suggesting that the perpetrator may have returned to his normal occupation. [...] "If you were planning on going 'back to work on Monday', then you would need {{as much time as}} possible {{to get out of the}} woods, find transportation and get home. The very best time for this is in front of a four-day weekend, which is the timing Dan Cooper chose for his crime." [...] Furthermore, [...] "if he was planning ahead, he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> hitchhike out of the woods, and it is much easier to get picked up in a suit and tie than in old blue jeans." ...|$|E
500|$|Colt <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{make his}} revolvers affordable, {{as the death}} of many great inventions was a high retail price. Colt fixed his prices at a level below his {{competition}} to maximize sales volume. From his experience in haggling with government officials, he knew what numbers {{he would have to}} generate to make enough profit to invest money in improving his machinery, thereby limiting imitators' ability to produce a comparable weapon at a lower price. Although successful at this, for the most part, his preoccupation with marketing strategies and patent protection caused him to miss a great opportunity in firearms development when he dismissed an idea from one of his gunsmiths, Rollin White. White had an idea of a [...] "bored-through" [...] revolver cylinder to allow the use of metallic cartridges in a handgun. After Colt fired White for suggesting an improvement to his revolver, White took his idea to Colt's competitor, Smith & Wesson, who patented his invention and kept Colt from being able to build cartridge firearms for almost 20 years.|$|E
50|$|The {{narrator is}} assumed to be a teenage boy living in an urban area. He is trying to win the hearts of the local girls. However, because of his {{upbringing}} and his culture, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> hide his identity in order to please a white girl or a halfie.

5000|$|Corlath {{and his men}} {{ride away}} into the desert; however his [...] "kelar," [...] a magical element of the royal bloodline, incites him to return and kidnap Harry. Corlath <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> comply with the kelar's compulsion, but he is {{nonetheless}} ashamed that he must abduct a young woman, and an Outlander. He commands his people to treat Harry as an honored guest.|$|R
2500|$|To {{comply with}} the {{provisions}} of MLB's drug policy, Hamilton provides urine samples for drug testing {{at least three times}} per week. [...] Rangers' coach Johnny Narron says of the frequent testing: [...] "I think he looks forward to the tests. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he's</b> an addict. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be accountable. <b>He</b> looks at those tests as a way to reassure people around him who had faith." ...|$|R
500|$|Berry {{was famous}} for his {{attention}} to detail and preparation, which he used to overcome his physical limitations. Considered slow for a wide receiver, he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds. Rather than speed, he was renowned for his precise pass patterns and sure hands; he rarely dropped passes, and he fumbled only once in his career. He would squeeze Silly Putty constantly to strengthen his hands. He and Unitas regularly worked after practice and developed the timing and knowledge of each other's abilities that made each more effective. The reason for this, according to Berry, was that the two did not think on the same wavelength. [...] "Every season we had {{to start all over}} on our timing, especially the long ball," [...] said Berry. [...] "He <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> release the ball when I was eighteen yards from scrimmage for me to receive it thirty-eight yards out. I knew I had to make my break in those first eighteen yards and get free within 2.8 seconds." [...] He also relied on shifty moves, and by his count, he had 88 different moves to get open, all of which he practiced every week.|$|E
500|$|When Steven S. DeKnight {{was writing}} the episode [...] "Run" [...] {{for the first}} {{official}} appearance of Bart Allen, he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give the character certain characteristics that embodied his comic book counterpart. DeKnight knew Bart had faster than Clark, because in the comic, that is one advantage Flash has over Superman. DeKnight also featured Bart as a [...] "smart-ass", after being inspired by the sarcastic Flash that appears in the animated television series, Justice League. DeKnight's belief is that Bart enjoys his powers, and would not exhibit the more [...] "somber or serious" [...] characteristics of other character. As Gallner pointed out, Bart accepts who he is, and what he can do, and he even abuses his gifts somewhat. The difference between him and Clark is that Bart {{is not afraid to}} show the world what he can do. Gallner also suggested that in his character's initial appearance, Bart is living in a [...] "confused" [...] state, because he has developed these extraordinary powers, his parents do not accept him, and he ends up turning to thievery just to take care of himself.|$|E
500|$|At 7:00 P.M. on May 31, J. Donald Cameron convened the Republican National Committee's {{last meeting}} {{before the opening}} of the convention. Of the forty-six men at the meeting, Cameron counted only sixteen allies. The rest of the men were anti-Grant delegates who had decided to gang up on Cameron. Colorado senator Jerome B. Chaffee was the first to bring up the unit rule at the meeting. Chaffee handed Cameron a {{handwritten}} motion that was orchestrated by William E. Chandler. Cameron expected this, and <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> find some fault in Chaffee's motion. Cameron called Chaffee's motion out of order. Upon being questioned by Chaffee, Cameron explained that the committee could only appoint a temporary chairman to the convention, and could not vote on the unit rule issue (which he said belonged to the Rules Committee). Cameron then used George Cornelius Gorham, a California Stalwart delegate who as secretary of the United States Senate had become an expert on parliamentary procedure, to justify his ruling. One by one, anti-Grant delegates unsuccessfully tried to appeal Cameron's motion. Gorham proclaimed that as committee chairman, Cameron could do [...] "as he saw fit." [...] Marshall Jewell, a Connecticut delegate and national committee member who had served in Grant's administration as Postmaster General, spoke up against Cameron's rulings. Cameron did not comment, and then called for a brief recess. After the recess, he acknowledged a motion from William E. Chandler to elect George Frisbie Hoar, a neutral senator and delegate from Massachusetts, as the convention's temporary chairman.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after {{beginning}} hisswitchboard {{career with}} one large company that obviously would hire the disabled, Jack Trucket said, [...] "I firmly believe a handicapped person {{will be a}} better worker because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> hold the job. Other people can quit their jobs and go get another right away. But I know I can't go across the street to work for someone else, just like that".|$|R
50|$|After {{spending}} {{weeks as}} James's henchman, Hal became lost when James was rendered unconscious after {{being caught in}} a fire. <b>Knowing</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> protect James, Hal kidnapped him from the hospital, hid him {{in the basement of}} the police station, and asked John Dixon to make sure that <b>he</b> lived. <b>Knowing</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> help James, but not <b>having</b> James <b>to</b> tell him what to do, Hal went to Barbara for help. Fortunately, Barbara was able to crack through the programming by mentioning Emily and Hal's children. Suddenly realizing that James was controlling him, a still unstable Hal went to James and decided to make him pay. Luckily, Barbara and Margo found Hal before he was able to shoot James and they talked him into turning himself in.|$|R

2500|$|George Washington marched {{his army}} to Bedford in 1794 to subdue the Whiskey Rebellion. There {{was much more}} at stake than quieting the {{uprising}} of rebels angered by a tax on whiskey; Washington felt the Constitution itself was at risk. The rebellion mainly consisted of farmers who could, due to {{the high cost of}} pack mule transport to the eastern cities, earn more selling whiskey instead of grain. The rebellion spread fast, and when it reached Pittsburgh some rebels threatened to burn the city to the ground. Anarchy was on its way; the British and French watched every move hoping they could come back and take over. Washington <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> act and make a statement; the laws of America would be obeyed. 12,950 militiamen were called to Bedford leaving the rebels without many choices. One historian later stated, [...] "It was at Bedford that the new federal government was finally to establish itself as sovereign in its own time and place." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the centennial}} of Escrivá's birthday, Cardinal Ratzinger (who became Pope Benedict XVI) commented: [...] "I have always been {{impressed}} by Josemaría Escrivá's explanation of the name 'Opus Dei': an explanation ... gives {{us an idea of}} the founder's spiritual profile. Escrivá <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> found something, but he was also conscious that what he was founding was not his own work, that he himself did not invent anything and that the Lord was merely making use of him. So it was not his work, but Opus Dei (God's Work). [...] gives us to understand that he was in a permanent dialogue, a real contact with the One who created us and works for us and with us... If therefore St Josemaría speaks of the common vocation to holiness, {{it seems to me that}} he is basically drawing on his own personal experience, not of having done incredible things himself, but of having let God work. Therefore a renewal, a force for good was born in the world even if human weaknesses will always remain." ...|$|E
2500|$|Uncertain whether Baltimore or Washington was the Confederate objective, Wallace <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> delay their {{approach}} until reinforcements could reach either city. Wallace saw Monocacy Junction, also called Frederick Junction, [...] southeast of Frederick, {{as the most}} logical point to defend Baltimore and Washington. A plain extended north and west from the river at Monocacy Junction to the Catoctin Mountains, [...] away. From Monocacy Junction, the B Railroad's bridge crossed the river {{at the foot of}} a bluff. A wooden bridge provided the Georgetown Pike access to Washington across the Monocacy River, a short distance downriver, while a stone bridge took Baltimore Pike across the Monocacy [...] upriver. Two blockhouses, one near the junction and another on the bluff above the railroad bridge, provided additional protection. A 24-pound howitzer was installed at the blockhouse on the bluff. If Wallace could stretch his force across [...] of the stream to protect both turnpike bridges, the railroad bridge, and several river fords, he could force Early to disclose the strength and objective of the Confederate force and delay him as long as possible.|$|E
