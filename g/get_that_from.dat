5000|$|In the Einsatzgruppen trial, Sandberger {{was charged}} with crimes against humanity, war crimes, and {{membership}} in a criminal organization, that is, the SS. At his trial, Sandberger denied responsibility for the killings described in the 15 October report and sought to blame the German field police and Estonian home guard. This {{was rejected by the}} tribunal, which found that the Estonian home guard was under Sandberger's jurisdiction and control for specific operations, as shown by the same report. Similarly, Sandberger claimed he had arrested the Jews sent to Pskov to protect them, hoping that during the internment the Führer order might be revoked or meliorated and he was not in general responsible for their execution at the Pskov detention camp. Sandberger said he was responsible for [...] "only a fraction" [...] of the killings. Sandberger placed this [...] "fraction" [...] at 300 to 350 persons. Q. The sum total of Communists seized runs to about 14,500; do you see that? A. Yes, 14,500, yes. Q. That means 1,000 were shot? A. Yes, I <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>from</b> the document. Q. You know it. Did you know of it? Do you remember it?A. The report must have been submitted to me. Q. Then at one time, at least, you knew of it? A. Yes. Q. Were you in Estonia then? A. Yes, but they were not shot on my own responsibility. I am only responsible for 350.Q. You are responsible for 350? A. That is my estimate. Sandberger claimed the execution of the Jews at Pskov happened in his absence and without his knowledge. The tribunal found that Sandberger's own testimony convicted him: [...] Q. You collected these men in the camps?A. Yes. I gave the order.Q. You knew that at some future time they could expect nothing but death? A. I was hoping that Hitler would withdraw the order or change it.Q. You knew that the probability, bordering on certainty, was that they would be shot after being collected? A. I knew that there was this possibility, yes.Q. In fact, almost a certainty, isn't that right? A. It was probable. [...] Q. You collected these Jews, according to the basic order, didn't you, the Hitler Order? A. Yes. Q. And then they were shot; they were shot; isn't that right?A. Yes. Q. By members of your command? A. From Estonian men who were subordinated to my Sonderkommando leaders; that is also myself then. Q. Then, in fact, they were shot by members under your command?A. Yes. Q. Then, {{as a result of the}} Fuehrer Order, these Jews were shot?A. Yes.|$|E
