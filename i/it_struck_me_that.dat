500|$|Glazunov and Lyadov were {{friendly}} with Tchaikovsky and were charmed by him. Glazunov studied Tchaikovsky's works and [...] "found much that was new... that was instructive {{for us as}} young musicians. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Tchaikovsky, who was above all a lyrical and melodic composer, had introduced operatic elements into his symphonies. I admired the thematic material of his works less than the inspired unfolding of his thoughts, his temperament and the constructural perfection." ...|$|E
500|$|Of {{his time}} in the Army, Gore later stated, [...] "I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I was proud to wear my country's uniform." [...] He also later stated that his {{experience}} in Vietnam didn't change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake, but <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> opponents to the war, including myself, really did {{not take into account the}} fact that there were an awful lot of South Vietnamese who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom. Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something I was naively unprepared for.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed to moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Unusual Suspects" [...] an A-, and {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "is a love letter to {{the very idea of}} paranoia". Furthermore, VanDerWerff argued that [...] "as the episode moved its way to its climax, when Mr. X improbably lets the Gunmen live after seeing as much as they did [...] <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> what we’re seeing here may not entirely be meant to be taken seriously, just as 'Memoirs Of A Cigarette Smoking Man' [...] is more about who the CSM wished he might have been than the person he actually was. This isn’t a true story; it’s a manifesto." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 6/10, and, while calling the entry [...] "an interesting diversion from the normal format of the series", he noted that [...] "there are still some issues with the plausibility of the story, and ultimately, the questions surrounding Mulder overshadow the character development of the Gunmen themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Amish Tripathi is {{a finance}} {{professional}} educated from Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIM-C). While {{working in the}} insurance industry, Tripathi felt that his life was devoid of any meaning or self. Ultimately {{he decided to take}} the spiritual route. He started reading on the different philosophies and the Indian mythologies. One day, while watching a historical program, Tripathi and his family got into the discussion about consciousness and the evil inside man. In the program they learned that in ancient Persia, demons were known as Daeva (a term reserved for the Gods in Indian mythology), and angels were called Asuras (a term reserved for demons in Indian mythology). Tripathi added, [...] "It set me thinking that this was exact opposite of our Vedic etymology where evil was Asura and gods were Devas. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> if the two civilizations were to confront each other, they would be at stark odds and calling each other evil." [...] But when he decided {{to write a book about}} the philosophy of evil, his family discouraged him, saying that the subject itself was not popular and would get a narrow audience. They suggested that Tripathi write a thriller/adventure novel and the philosophy should be a part of the story, hence there would be a mainstream appeal in it. Tripathi felt that no subject was better than Shiva, one of the major Hindu deity and the destroyer of evil; his journey and stories about him would deliver the philosophy that he wanted to convey, to his readers. Once he started to write a book about Shiva, he decided to base it on some fundamental beliefs of his. He noted that the Hindu Gods were probably not [...] "mythical beings or a figment of a rich imagination", but rather they were once human beings like the rest. It was their deeds in the human life that made them famous as Gods.|$|E
2500|$|I {{reminded}} them that I haven't played a meaningful soccer game in {{almost two years}} and I certainly couldn't fill the holes left by those players. Over the ensuing days, I {{began to think about}} their inquiries and <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> perhaps this is something I should consider. I care so deeply about the Galaxy organization, and I believe I could help in a small way to aid the team in its quest for a sixth MLS championship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said. [...] "That's {{one of the}} {{differences}} between you; you're not assertive. <b>It</b> has <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you don't always realize your value." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyhow, there's {{no doubt}} that Sylvia Marston scores in {{securing}} you on the same favorable terms. <b>It</b> has <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> she's a woman who gets things easily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dick, do you know, <b>it</b> has <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is rather}} awkward, my being here alone with you like this. I don't {{think you had}} better come in with me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Then he {{came upon}} a copy of Andrea Palladio's Quattro Libri d'archittetura. [...] "You could never believe," [...] {{he wrote to his}} friend and {{long-term}} correspondent Marchesi, [...] "the impression that this book made. Then <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had every reason to consider myself badly guided" [...] before that point (Loukomsky 1928). He turned for new, Neoclassical instruction from Antoine Decrezet, a friend of Winckelmann, and the former's pupil Niccola Giansimoni, measuring and drawing the antiquities of Rome.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} soundtrack by David Schwartz {{does not}} include any songs by the Beatles because [...] "the producers could not get clearance from the notoriously difficult copyright holders, a company owned by Michael Jackson." [...] Critic Jim DeRogatis notes that, [...] "the movie was over before <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the soundtrack was devoid of any Beatles songs [...] Such is our saturation in all things Beatles-related that their actual music isn't even missed in the movie. And maybe that should {{tell us something about}} getting back to what really matters in this group's legacy." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> now <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{during this}} {{conversation}} I {{had been holding}} my dear girl in my arms, and she had not shown the slightest sign of resistance or disapprobation. This made my heart beat high.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a {{maternal}} grandfather {{must be a}} grandmother, but I didn't say so.|$|E
60|$|All {{the way to}} Styles, Mary talked {{fast and}} feverishly. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> in some way she was nervous of Poirot's eyes.|$|E
60|$|I glanced {{through the}} {{twilight}} at his convexity and I must confess <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{on the whole}} he wasn't particularly good value.|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> luckily <b>that,</b> {{though he}} {{remained}} as proof against gaiety as ever, he was, {{thanks to his}} preoccupation, not disagreeably affected by my tone. [...] "Of course if you've no idea, I can get nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hem!" [...] {{said her}} father. [...] "Well, I should {{think it might}} be so; <b>it</b> always <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the {{prejudice}} must be grounded upon some absurd notion, the memory of which had passed away, while the impression remained." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not joking, Miss Purcell; are you?" [...] the Colonel said, {{looking at}} her earnestly. [...] "Why, I have talked to you a dozen times and <b>it</b> never <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{you were in the}} {{slightest}} degree deaf." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{the best}} thing I could do was {{to shake hands with}} the wrathful foreman, and I did it very heartily.|$|E

60|$|He {{scarcely}} {{heard me}} {{and made no}} move to take the proffered cigar. All at once <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the rustic simplicity which had characterized him had vanished.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Hathaway, smiling; [...] "I {{was a boy}} at that time, {{and lived}} up to my salary. I know nothing of his bank difficulties, but <b>it</b> always <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Colonel Pendleton was himself an honorable man." ...|$|R
60|$|As the {{old lady}} uttered the last words, I thought I saw her eyes turn from heaven, and take the earthly {{direction}} of the sofa in the front parlor. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> also <b>that</b> her lips looked rather dry. Upon these two hints I spoke.|$|R
6000|$|I {{rushed over}} towards her, and when close {{was about to}} say impulsively, [...] "Why did you leave your tomb?" [...] when <b>it</b> {{suddenly}} <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the question would be malapropos and embarrassing in many ways. So, better judgment prevailing, I said instead: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blome {{never moved}} a muscle {{but he seemed}} to come to life. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Steele's {{presence}} had made an impression on Blome which was new to the rustler.|$|E
60|$|I couldn't help gaping. Somehow one didn't {{associate}} Voules with engagements. Then <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I'd {{no right}} to butt in on his secret sorrows, so I switched the conversation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it was so," [...] exclaimed Cecil, {{starting}} forward. [...] "I saw a baby's {{mantle of}} that peculiar green, and <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> some farmer's {{wife had been}} aping little Julia's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Murray? I don't {{suppose you}} know that you won him over by letting him miss a snipe you could have shot. It's a curious reason for giving you his confidence, isn't it? But <b>it</b> has <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> in many ways you and he are alike." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t {{know that}} I am much interested,” Osborne replied. “He was of some service to us during our voyage from Japan, and seemed a smart young fellow. <b>It</b> merely <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I might {{give him a}} lift up in return {{for one or two}} small favors.” ...|$|R
