5|$|Early on September 16 the JMA {{started to}} issue Typhoon force wind warnings, for the Naha, Okinawa; however these were {{discontinued}} later that day. The JMA then placed the Yokohama, Moji and Naha under a Typhoon Warning {{early the next}} day. These warnings were kept in place until early on September 19, when the JMA added the Kushiro and Otaru to the warnings. However, the warnings were dropped for all areas except Yokohama and Kushiro as the typhoon turned away from Japan. These warnings stayed in effect until late the next <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were cancelled as Choi-wan began to dissipate.|$|E
5|$|The Tongan Meteorological Service {{reported}} {{that some of}} its property and equipment had been damaged. The property damage had an approximate value of about $2,000 (2009TOP, $1,0002009 USD). This included a Stevenson screen, office guttering, a HF radio antennae, signal processor, and satellite receiver. They also {{reported that}} the National weather forecasting center in Fua’amotu had experienced power failure on April 4 at 1600 UTC; for this reason the center operated using a small portable generator until early the next <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> stopped issuing warnings as Lin {{was no longer a}} threat to Tonga. Power was eventually restored later that day.|$|E
5|$|The JTWC kept Rammasun as a super typhoon {{until early}} on May11, when they {{reported}} that the typhoon had weakened into a category four typhoon, while the JMA were reporting that the typhoon had wind speeds of 175km/h (110mph). Later that day both agencies reported that the typhoon had weakened even further, with the JMA reporting that Rammasun had winds of 160km/h (100mph), while the JTWC reported that Rammasun had weakened into a Category 3 typhoon. The JTWC then reported within their next advisory that Rammasun had weakened into a Category 2 typhoon whilst the JMA reported that the typhoon had winds of 140km/h (90mph). The next day as the Typhoon moved out of PAGASA's area of responsibility Rammasun was downgraded to a Category 1 typhoon by the JTWC. Later that day the JMA downgraded Rammasun to a Severe Tropical Storm whilst the JTWC downgraded it to an extratropical cyclone and released their final advisory on the system. The JMA continued to issue advisories on severe tropical storm Rammasun until early the next <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> downgraded it to an extratropical low.|$|E

5|$|The {{role of the}} Venizelists {{during the}} battle has been {{intensely}} contested by witnesses and historians. Vice admiral Louis Dartige du Fournet wrote that Venizelists supported the Allies and attacked passing Greek royalist army units. Venizelists participation was allegedly so extensive, that lead Admiral du Fourne wrote in his report {{that he had been}} involved in a civil war. The Venizelists continued fighting after the evacuation of the Allied marines until the next <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> capitulated. The royalists claimed that large caches of weapons and ammunition were found in their strongholds packed in French military containers. Venizelists were led to prison surrounded by a furious mob and supposedly only the royal army escorts saved them from being murdered by the angry citizens. Other historians deny that the Venizelists collaborated with the Allied forces: Pavlos Karolidis, a contemporary royalist historian, argues that no Venizelist attacked their fellow citizens and the only weapons found during the raids on prominent Venizelists' houses were knives.|$|E
5|$|Wolfgang Zenker was {{allocated}} to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserübung. The group's {{task was to}} transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment (139. Gebirgsjäger Regiment) and {{the headquarters of the}} 3rd Mountain Division (3. Gebirgs-Division) to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next <b>day.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> arrived at the Ofotfjord, west of Narvik, on the early morning of 9 April, the three ships of the 4th Flotilla, under the command of Commander Erich Bey, were ordered to land their troops in the Herjangsfjord (a northern branch of the Ofotfjord) in order to capture a Norwegian Army armory at Elvegårdsmoen. The troops encountered little resistance, but off-loading them was slow because there was only a single wooden pier available. Wolfgang Zenker was able to partially refuel during the following night, but returned to the Herjansfjord well before dawn.|$|E
5|$|Benbow {{was soon}} at sea again in March 1695, being {{appointed}} commander-in-chief of His Majesty's ships {{which were then}} {{off the coast of}} France. His squadron was highly successful, taking a number of French merchants in early April and bringing them to England as prizes. Benbow was recommended by Lord Berkeley, who had served with Benbow at Saint-Malo, to be promoted to rear-admiral at the next opportunity, and in the meantime he was appointed to the command of the 70-gun HMS Northumberland. He was soon joined by a volunteer – his then fourteen-year-old son – also named John Benbow. Benbow then sailed with Berkeley and the Dutch lieutenant-admiral Philips van Almonde to Saint-Malo, intending to operate against privateering operations being conducted from the area. Benbow moved to command HMS Charles Galley, to direct the inshore operations of ten English and Dutch warships, nine English bomb vessels, and seventeen small boats and vessels. They began operations on their arrival off Saint-Malo on 4 July, remaining in action until evening the next <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> withdrew, without having achieved any decisive result. Several houses had been destroyed for the damage and loss of a few of the bomb vessels. Benbow was given eight bomb vessels and seven or eight frigates and was dispatched down the coast. He attacked Granville on 8 July, shelling it with over 900 bombs over several hours, and departed having set the town ablaze.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—The {{relation}} between social anxiety and hedonic activity remains poorly understood. From a self-regulatory perspective, {{we hypothesized that}} socially anxious individuals experience diminished positive experiences and events on <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are unable to manage socially anxious feelings adequately. In this 21 -day experience-sampling study, we constructed daily measures of social anxiety and emotion regulation. Greater dispositional social anxiety was associated with less positive affect and fewer positive events in everyday life. Among individuals defined as socially anxious from their scores on a global self-report measure of social anxiety, the number of positive events was lowest on <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> both were more socially anxious and tended to suppress emotions and highest on <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were less socially anxious and more accepting of emotional experiences. Irrespective of dispositional social anxiety, participants reported the most intense positive emotions on the <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were both least socially anxious and most accepting of emotional experiences. Possible clinical implications are discussed. For decades, the study of individuals with excessive social anxiety has advanced by examining their negative experiences and events. Cataloguing the nature, concomitants, and causes of significant distress and impairment was essential {{to the development of}} appropriate conceptual models and interventions. However, we believe {{there is something to be}} gained by shifting focus to the elements of living a pleasurable and meaningful life that are typically disrupted by social anxiety.

25|$|A {{person who}} {{goes around the}} world {{from east to west}} (the same {{direction}} as Magellan's voyage) would gain or set their clock back one hour for every 15° of longitude crossed, and would gain 24 hours for one circuit of the globe from east to west if they did not compensate by setting their clock forward one <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> crossed the IDL. In contrast, a west-to-east circumnavigation of the globe loses an hour for every 15° of longitude crossed but gains back a day when crossing the IDL. The IDL must therefore be observed in conjunction with the Earth's time zones: on crossing it in either direction, the calendar date is adjusted by one day.|$|E
