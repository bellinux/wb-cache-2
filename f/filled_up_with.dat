5|$|The {{fears of}} {{terrorism}} received an extra boost from {{the disruption of}} communications and news as facilities were devoured by the fire. The General Letter Office in Threadneedle Street burned down early on Monday morning, through which post passed for the entire country. The London Gazette just managed to put out its Monday issue before the printer's premises went up in flames. The whole nation depended on these communications, and the void which they left <b>filled</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> rumours.|$|E
5|$|Footprints {{from the}} Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003, when Currie and colleagues {{described}} several {{examples from the}} Nemegt locality. Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids (probably Saurolophus), while two have been left by a large theropod (probably Tarbosaurus) and yet another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia, which showed a matching hind foot morphology. The researchers argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was probably the only known sauropod from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym, making it unlikely that the tracks were left by another, similar titanosaur. The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently <b>filled</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> sand. Today only the sand infill remains, with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} part of the county is known as the barrens, named by the early settlers for the lack timber there. For the first decades of settlement, settlers refused to purchase the land in the barrens because it was considered too far from the timber needed to build homes, fires, fences, and other necessities. The barrens were swept by annual wildfires that prevented the growth of trees. The largest barren ran from the northern edge of Corydon northward to Palmyra, and from the Floyd Knobs in the east, westward to the Blue River. The Central Barren covered most of the upper middle part of the county. As settlement expanded and farming grew in the early 19thcentury, settlers began to discover that the barrens were among the most fertile farmlands in the state, and they quickly <b>filled</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> landholders. As settlement increased, the wildfires were stopped and by the start of the 20thcentury the uninhabited parts of the barrens had become forested and have remained so until modern times.|$|E

25|$|The first {{settlers}} of Woodford County occupied crude log cabins, {{with the}} cracks between the rough-hewed timber {{in the walls}} <b>filled</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> clay to help retain heat and block the wind. Windows, if they existed at all, were made of oiled papers, while doors and floors were constructed of rough boards split from trees and attached together with wooden pegs. Construction of the cabins was primitive, with the floor plan generally involving a single room heated with a fireplace.|$|E
25|$|In the Athenian fleet, {{during the}} Peloponnesian War, {{there are a}} few {{variations}} to the typical crew layout of a trireme. One variation used a drastically reduced number of oarsmen so as to use the ship as a troop transport. The thranites would row from the top benches, {{while the rest of the}} space below would be <b>filled</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> hoplites. Another variation, which the Athenians used for transporting horses (the Athenian fleet had about 10 or so of these ships), had 60 oarsmen, leaving the rest of the ship open for horses.|$|E
25|$|In January 1941, the 26th Infantry Division, {{which was}} {{recently}} federalized, consisted entirely of Massachusetts National Guard members. Over the next 3 months, its ranks <b>filled</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> members from New York and New England. Starting for 7 months in April 1941, the 26th left Camp Edwards {{to participate in}} the Carolina Maneuvers and the Coastal Patrol, while other National Guard and Army Divisions came to train the camp. The 26th returned to Camp Edwards on December 6, 1941, with the expectation of completing their year of service soon. The bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and the subsequent declaration of war by the United States, resulted in extension of federal service for the division through 1945.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, {{the strain}} {{was found on}} the coast of California (U.S.A.), near San Diego, and also on the coast of New South Wales, Australia. The California {{colonization}} was small enough to be considered controllable: it was covered with tarpaulin which was held down with sandbags {{at the edges of the}} infestation. Then chlorine was poured in through tubes which fed into certain openings in the tarpaulin: the interior of the tarpaulin <b>filled</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> chlorine and killed living organisms inside it, not only the unwanted alga but also fish, invertebrates and other seaweeds. The killing of such other organisms was not desirable but was deemed preferable to letting the algae grow unchecked.|$|E
25|$|Setting {{out from}} Pearl Harbor on 13 September {{for her first}} war patrol, the {{submarine}} prowled the waters south of Honshū, {{the largest and most}} important of Japan's home islands. She remained below during daylight hours and came up after dark {{to get a better view}} as she recharged her batteries and <b>filled</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> fresh air. On the night of 30 September, Trepang spotted a fast convoy departing Tokyo Bay. The submarine gave chase and closed in on a group of ships which included two large tankers, a small freighter, and an escort. The submarine fired an overlapping spread of torpedoes which struck the freighter, 750-ton Takunan Maru, and sent her to the bottom.|$|E
25|$|In {{the metal}} type era, typefaces {{intended}} to be printed small contained ink traps, small indentations at the junctions of strokes that would be <b>filled</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> ink spreading out, maintaining the intended appearance of the type design. Without ink traps, the excess ink would blob and ruin the crisp edge. At larger sizes, these ink traps were not necessary, so display faces did not have them. They have also been removed from most digital fonts, as these will normally be viewed on screen or printed through inkjet printing, laser printing, offset lithography, electrophotographic printing or other processes that do not show the ink spread of letterpress. Ink traps have remained common on designs {{intended to be}} printed on low-quality, absorbent paper, especially newsprint and telephone directories.|$|E

25|$|Dark {{did much}} to improve Lord's. When he took over, there were two ponds on the land which {{frequently}} <b>filled</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> rubble and the playing area had a very rough surface. The ponds were eventually drained and filled in while ground maintenance relied {{to a large extent}} on sheep to keep the grass down and a small roller to even out the surface. Dark's development programme was ambitious for it included extension and improvement of the pavilion and the installation of gas lighting. He added a billiard room, a real tennis court, a running track and planted 400 trees. He struggled to improve the notoriously bad pitch and some of his extra attractions, such as pony racing and Red Indian encampments, cannot have helped the condition of the outfield.|$|E
25|$|With {{the gold}} rush largely over by 1860, Melbourne {{continued}} to grow {{on the back of}} continuing gold mining, as the major port for exporting the agricultural products of Victoria, especially wool, and a developing manufacturing sector protected by high tariffs. An extensive radial railway network spreading into the countryside was established from the late 1850s. Further major public buildings were begun in the 1860s and 1870s such as the Supreme Court, Government House, and the Queen Victoria Market. The central city <b>filled</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> shops and offices, workshops, and warehouses. Large banks and hotels faced the main streets, with fine townhouses in the east end of Collins Street, contrasting with tiny cottages down laneways within the blocks. The Aboriginal population continued to decline with an estimated 80% total decrease by 1863, due primarily to introduced diseases, particularly smallpox, frontier violence and dispossession from their lands.|$|E
25|$|On 11 November a Martinsyde {{and nine}} B E.'s, loaded with bombs and petrol, left the Kantara and Mahemdia {{aerodromes}} {{at dawn and}} assembled at Mustabig, just west of Bir el Mazar. There a raiding force of five B.E.'s and the Martinsyde formed the largest force yet organised by Australians or any other air squadron in the East, <b>filled</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> petrol and bombs and set off in formation towards Beersheba. Over Beersheba the anti-aircraft guns engaged them with high explosive and shrapnel, and the raiders flew through a flurry of white, black, and green bursts. The Martinsyde dropped a 100–lb. bomb fair in {{the centre of the}} aerodrome; two 20–lb. bombs hit tents; others made direct hits on the railway to Beersheba and the station. A Fokker and an Aviatik took to the air but were decisively beaten. After photographing Beersheba and the damage caused by the bombs, the airmen returned, reconnoitering Khan Yunis and Rafa on the way. All machines arrived safely, after having spent seven hours in flight. Two days later a German aeroplane retaliated by bombing Cairo.|$|E

25|$|The densely forested terrain also {{limited the}} use of tanks and {{provided}} cover for German anti-tank elements equipped with panzerfaust shaped-charge grenade launchers. Improvised rocket launchers were made, using rocket tubes from aircraft and spare jeep trailers. Later in the battle, it proved necessary to blast tank routes through the forest. Transport was similarly limited {{by the lack of}} routes: at critical times, it proved difficult to reinforce or supply front-line units or to evacuate their wounded. The Germans were hampered by much the same difficulties, worsened because their divisions had already taken heavy losses on the retreat through France and were hastily <b>filled</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> untrained boys, unfit for service, and old men. Transport was also a problem, because of the difficult roads and the lack of trucks and fuel. Most supplies had to be manhandled to the front line. But the German defenders had the advantage in that their commanders and many of their soldiers had been fighting for some years and had learned the necessary tactics for fighting efficiently in winter and forested areas, whereas the Americans were often well-trained but inexperienced.|$|E
25|$|Cattle Island {{exists in}} one of the extreme points of Hirakud Reservoir, a natural wonder. It is near Kumarbandh village of Belpahar-Banharpali range which is about 90km from Sambalpur. The island is a {{submerged}} hill, and before the construction of Hirakud Dam it was a developed village. During the resettlement period, villagers left some of their cattle behind; when the dam construction was over, the cattle settled on the hilltop. With the passage of time the nearby area <b>filled</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the reservoir water, turning the hilltop into an island. Being away from mankind, the cattle are now wild, very swift and not easily caught. Living on a hilltop with dense forest, they are larger than tame cattle, almost all of which are white in colour. Nearby residents attempt to capture these animals from time to time, but these hunts are rarely successful. Though descended from tame cattle, these animals provide a contrasting picture of this breed of animal returning to life in the wild. If the visit to this island is taken by a boat in the Hirakud reservoir it's an adventurous trip with breathtaking views.|$|E
