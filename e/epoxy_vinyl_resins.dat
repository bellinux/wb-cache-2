30|$|VEGF mainly {{consisted}} of <b>epoxy</b> <b>vinyl</b> phenolic <b>resin,</b> {{and the color}} change probably because the molecular chain of the phenolic groups was prone to degradation under high temperature, manifesting as coking, yellowing, or loss of gloss on its appearance. The deformation of FRP might have occurred because the molecular chains stretch at high temperature but fail to shrink back into the original state when the temperature decreases. Russel (2011) summarized that deformation can be either elastic or viscous. The former often led to cracking and peeling, while the latter produced a pore-free solid. Roberts et al. (2011) concluded that deformation results in dramatic color change at high temperatures, although the films had to be irreversibly elastically deformed to achieve this. It can be concluded that VEGF could withstand the temperature of 120  °C, {{but was unable to}} withstand the thermal shock of 180  °C. Thus, VEGF may be damaged by the high temperature flue gas of power plant bypass. The utilization of FRP may cause corrosion failure under the long-running process of power plant stacks.|$|R

It means that there is a catalytic effect of silica na-noparticles in the cure reaction. A dynamic kinetic model was obtained to predict the degree of cure and cure rate of resin.

40|$|Abstract — An {{important}} {{technological development}} that has {{contributed significantly to}} the growth of the composite is the development of a strong and stiff fibres such as glass, carbon and aramide along with the concurrent development in polymer industry, resulting in various polymeric materials such as <b>epoxy,</b> <b>vinyl</b> ester, phenolic <b>resins,</b> etc. to serve as matrix materials. Over the last few years, usage of FRPs using polymer matrices have seen tremendous growth as they can be tailored to suit specific application. The mechanical and physical properties of FRP depend upon type, shape, length and orientation of the fibres. Generally long fibres transmit loads more effectively through the matrix. In spite of the complexity of their behaviour and the unconventational nature of fabrication, and other aspects, the usage of FRP’s in automotive industry, aerospace, marine application, sports equipments, house hold articles, construction of structural frames and many more has been beneficially realised. This paper deals with the charting of strategy for the application of PMC’s citing the specific reasons for selecting the particular material systems to its functionality. A brief review of modern FRPs is followed by a general discussion and the logical choice of a particular material system that has gained wide acceptance. With this knowledge as the basis, a material engineer is well placed to create innovative designs that are having fast effective gains and also material enhanced properties...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{viscosity}} of novel photopolymerizable liquid encapsulants (PLEs) for microelectronic devices was {{characterized as a}} function of the particle size distribution of the fused silica filler. Microelectronic devices are typically encapsulated using a transfer molding process in which the molding compound flows over the leadframe and wire bonds as it fills the mold. The molding compound should have a low viscosity to minimize problems such as: 1) incomplete mold filling; 2) lead frame movement during cavity filling; and 3) displacement of the wires that connect the die with the leadframe (wire sweep). We have developed a photopolymerizable liquid encapsulant using an <b>epoxy</b> novolac-based <b>vinyl</b> ester <b>resin</b> that may alleviate these problems. In this contribution, we have investigated the blending of two different particle size distributions of fused silica to tailor the viscosity of PLEs for microelectronic applications. We have characterized the viscosity of highly filled PLEs containing 70. 0, 72. 0, and 74. 0 wt% silica, and found that a blend of particle size distributions with a particle size ratio of 3. 13 resulted in the best viscosity reduction. In addition, the PLE viscosity decreased slightly with increasing concentration of a silane coupling agent. The resulting PLEs exhibit low viscosities at ambient temperature while maintaining desirable material properties for microelectronic applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{scope of}} the paper {{is to provide a}} {{short-term}} evaluation of some commercially available FRP tendon-anchor systems for application in prestressed concrete structures. Ten FRP tendon-anchor systems were stressed and subjected to sustained load for a period of three days to determine ease of installation, mechanical performance and anchor seating losses. The FRP tendons used aramid, carbon, and glass fibres embedded in <b>epoxy</b> or <b>vinyl</b> ester <b>resin</b> (except for one case). Anchors were of the wedge (or spike) and potted type. A minimum of two tests were conducted for each system at a load level equal to 65 % of the manufacturer's specified ultimate tendon strength. Collected data included load, strain, and displacement readings during both initial stressing and three-day sustained load. In most cases, anchorage devices permitted the stressing of the FRP tendons at the desired load level. Among wedge-type anchors, plastic and aluminium wedges had questionable performance, whereas steel wedges (in direct contact with the tendon or using a metal sleeve between tendon and wedge) showed good performance. Regardless of wedge material (plastic, aluminium, or steel), grit application to the wedge internal surface was highly beneficial. The spike anchor presented some installation difficulties. Resin potted anchors worked well and were easy to install. For the one case considered (wedge anchor), it was determined that retensioning produces early failure and anchor-zone temperatures between - 40 degrees C and + 60 degrees C have no effect on system performance. Anchor seating losses during short-term use are in general small and could become insignificant depending on the length of the tendon. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

40|$|External bonding of {{composite}} strips to {{the components}} of concrete construction is an effective technique in rehabilitation and upgrading of concrete construction. This thesis reports a study regarding the effects of adhesive properties on mechanical and structural performance of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) strips. The concrete beam was subjected to four point bending test to {{examine the effect of}} adhesive properties. It is found that the rubber modifier increased the maximum bending force, the corresponding displacement and flexural ductility, compared with those bonded with a neat epoxy resin, for all concrete beams tested with different number of FRP layers. There was a transition of major failure mechanism from 'delamination of CFRP strip' along the CFRP-concrete interface with relatively clean fracture surface to 'peel-off of concrete' with cracks propagating irregularly through the inside of concrete, when the number of CRRP strips was increased from two to four layers. The interlaminar fracture toughness of FRP strips-concrete interfaces was measured using the asymmetric double cantilever beam specimens. The mixed-mode interlaminar fracture toughness increased with the rubber content for both the <b>epoxy</b> or <b>vinyl</b> ester <b>resin,</b> the improvement being as large as about 13 % with 20 % rubber content. Apart from the higher interlaminar fracture toughness, the rubber modifier gave rise to higher stability during delamination, suggesting a beneficial effect of mitigation catastrophic failure in practical applications. A series of micro-hardness test on polished cross-sections of adhesive-concrete interface indicates that the rubber promoted the penetration of adhesive into the concrete, which may further improved strengthening of concrete beams using FRP strips. The finite element analysis method was carried out to study the stress profiles along the interface between CFRP strip and concrete. The numerical study indicates that both the shear and normal stress concentrations within about 15 mm from the strip ends were reduced with increasing the rubber modifier content, while the stress profiles remain much the same for the rest of interface. Also, the thicker the CFRP strip used, the higher the stress concentrations...|$|R
