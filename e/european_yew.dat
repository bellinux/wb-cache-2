50|$|In the {{photographs}} of a <b>European</b> <b>yew</b> (Taxus baccata) below, the aril starts out as a small, green band {{at the base of}} the seed, then turns brown to red as it enlarges and surrounds the seed, eventually becoming fleshy and scarlet in color at maturity. The aril is attractive to fruit-eating birds and is non-toxic (all other parts of the yew are toxic, including the seed housed inside the aril. If the seed is crushed or breaks/splits in the stomach of a bird, animal or human it will result in its imminent death), serving therefore to promote dispersal of the yew seed by birds, which digest the fleshy aril as a food source, and pass the seed out in their droppings.|$|E
