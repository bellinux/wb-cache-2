50|$|With {{this process}} the {{electronically}} generated image is scanned at speed to a photopolymer plate material that carries a thin black mask layer on the surface. The infrared laser-imaging head, which runs {{parallel to the}} drum axis, ablates the <b>integral</b> <b>mask</b> to reveal the uncured polymer underneath. A main ultraviolet exposure follows to form the image through the mask. The remaining black layer absorbs the ultraviolet radiation, which polymerizes the underlying photopolymer where the black layer has been removed. The exposed digital plate {{still needs to be}} processed like a conventional flexo plate. That is, using solvent-based washout with the necessary waste recovery techniques, although some water-washable digital plates are in development. This technology has been used since 1995 and is only now becoming more widely used around the world as more affordable equipment becomes available. Trade sources say there are around 650 digital platesetters installed in label, packaging and trade platemaking houses.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Non-invasive {{ventilation}} {{is largely}} {{used to treat}} acute and chronic respiratory failure. This ventilation encounters a non-negligible rate of failure related to the used interface/mask, but {{the reasons for this}} failure remain unclear. In order to shed light on this issue and to better understand the effects of the geometrical design of interfaces, we aimed to quantify flow, pressure and gas composition in terms of CO(2) and O(2) at the passage through different types of interface (oronasal mask, <b>integral</b> <b>mask</b> and helmet). In particular, we postulated that due to specific gas flow passing throughout the interface, the effective dead space added by the interface is not always related to the whole gas volume included in the interface. METHODS: Numerical simulations, using computational fluid dynamics, were used to describe pressure, flow and gas composition during ventilation with the different interfaces. RESULTS: Between the different interfaces the effective dead spaces differed only modestly (110 - 370 ml), whereas their internal volumes were markedly different (110 - 10, 000 ml). Effective dead space was limited to half the tidal volume for the most voluminous interface, whereas it was close to the interface gas volume for the less voluminous interfaces. Pressure variations induced by the flow ventilation throughout the interface were negligible. CONCLUSIONS: Effective dead space is not related to the internal gas volume included in the interface, suggesting that this internal volume should not be considered as a limiting factor for their efficacy during non-invasive ventilation. Patient's comfort and synchrony have also to be taken into account...|$|E

To construct this mask we use two new ideas. First, we consider local field as vector space over the finite field $GF(p^s) $. Second, we construct scaling function by arbitrary tree that has $p^s$ vertices. By fixed prime number $p$ there exist $p^{s(p^s- 2) }$ such trees.

40|$|Abstract: Texture {{enhancement}} is {{an important}} component of image processing, with extensive application in science and engineering. The quality of medical images, quantified using the texture of the images, plays {{a significant role in the}} routine diagnosis performed by medical practitioners. Previously, image texture enhancement was performed using classical <b>integral</b> order differential <b>mask</b> operators. Recently, first order fractional differential operators were implemented to enhance images. Experiments conclude that the use of the fractional differential not only maintains the low frequency contour features in the smooth areas of the image, but also nonlinearly enhances edges and textures corresponding to high-frequency image components. However, whilst these methods perform well in particular cases, they are not routinely useful across all applications. To this end, we applied the second order Riesz fractional differential operator to improve upon existing approaches of texture enhancement. Compared with the classical <b>integral</b> order differential <b>mask</b> operators and other fractional differential operators, our new algorithms provide higher signal to noise values, which leads to superior image quality...|$|R

50|$|Direct laser {{engraving}} of flexographic printing cylinders and plates {{has been an}} established process since the 1970s. This first began {{with the use of}} a carbon dioxide laser used to selectively ablate or evaporate a variety of rubber plate and sleeve materials to produce a print ready surface without the use of photography or chemicals. With this process there is no <b>integral</b> ablation <b>mask</b> as with direct photopolymer laser imaging (see below). Instead a high-power carbon dioxide laser head burns away, or ablates, unwanted material. The aim is to form sharp, relief images with steep first relief and contoured shoulder supported edges to give a high standard of process color reproduction. A short water wash and dry cycle follows, which is a lot less involved than in the post-processing stages for direct laser imaging or conventional flexo platemaking using photopolymer plates. After engraving, the photopolymer is exposed through the imaged black layer and washed out in the traditional photopolymer process requiring photography and chemicals. See below.|$|R
40|$|Corner {{detection}} is {{a fundamental}} step in image processing, and it takes {{an important role in}} target tracking, image stitching and three-dimension reconstruction. Harris algorithm is widely used in corner detection for simple calculation and its detection result is not affected by image rotation and light intensity changes. Harris algorithm uses <b>integral</b> differential <b>mask</b> to extract the image gradient, and the edges information remains in the low frequency part of images. When dealing with images with a large number of edge information, integral differential weakens the low frequency part of images obviously, thus the detection result is not really good. Besides, Harris algorithm does not have the property of scale-invariant. For these reasons, fractional differential and multiple scale-space method are put forward in this article to improve Harris algorithm. Experiments show that the detection result of improved algorithm is better than original Harris algorithm in dealing with images of much detailed information...|$|R
40|$|INTEGRAL {{is one of}} the few {{instruments}} {{capable of}} detecting X-rays above 20 keV. It is therefore in principle well suited for studies of X-ray variability in this regime. Because <b>INTEGRAL</b> uses coded <b>mask</b> instruments for its imaging, the reconstruction of light curves of X-ray sources is highly non-trivial. We present results from the comparison of two commonly employed algorithms, which measure flux from mask deconvolution (ii lc extract) and from calculat-ing the pixel illuminated fraction (ii light). Both methods agree well for timescales above about 10 s, the highest time resolution for which image reconstruction is possible. For higher time resolu-tion, ii light produces meaningful results, although the overall variance of the lightcurves is not preserved.

40|$|Context. In coded mask techniques, reconstructed sky {{images are}} pseudo-images: they are {{maps of the}} {{correlation}} between the image recorded on a detector and an array derived from the coded mask pattern. Aims. The INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope provides images where the flux of each detected source is given by the height of the local peak in the correlation map. As such, it cannot provide an estimate of the flux of an extended source. What is needed is intensity sky images giving the flux per solide angle as typically done at other wavelengths. Methods. In this paper, we present the response of the <b>INTEGRAL</b> IBIS/ISGRI coded <b>mask</b> instrument to extended sources. We develop a general method based on analytical calculations in order to measure the intensity and the associated error of any celestial source and validated with Monte-Carlo simulations. Results. We find that the sensitivity degrades almost linearly with the source extent. Analytical formulae are given as well as an easy-to-use recipe for the INTEGRAL user. We check this method on IBIS/ISGRI data but these results are general and applicable to any coded mask telescope. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for publication in A&...|$|R
40|$|Texture {{enhancement}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important techniques in digital image processing and plays an essential role in medical imaging since textures discriminate information. Most image texture enhancement techniques use classical <b>integral</b> order differential <b>mask</b> operators or fractional differential mask operators using fixed fractional order. These masks can produce excessive enhancement of low spatial frequency content, insufficient enhancement of large spatial frequency content, and retention of high spatial frequency noise. To improve upon existing approaches of texture enhancement, we derive an improved Variable Order Fractional Centered Difference (VOFCD) scheme which dynamically adjusts the fractional differential order instead of fixing it. The new VOFCD technique is based on the second order Riesz fractional differential operator using a Lagrange 3 -point interpolation formula, for both grey scale and colour image enhancement. We then use this method to enhance photographs and a set of medical images related to patients with stroke and Parkinson’s disease. The experiments show that our improved fractional differential mask has a higher signal to noise ratio value than the other fractional differential mask operators. Based on the corresponding quantitative analysis we conclude that the new method offers a superior texture enhancement over existing methods...|$|R

40|$|We present here {{results on}} the source {{location}} accuracy of the <b>INTEGRAL</b> IBIS/ISGRI coded <b>mask</b> telescope, based on ten years of INTEGRAL data and on recent developments in the data analysis procedures. Data were selected and processed with the new Off-line Scientific Analysis pipeline (OSA 10. 0) that benefits from the most accurate background corrections, the most performing coding noise cleaning and sky reconstruction algorithms available. We obtained updated parameters {{for the evaluation of}} the point source location error from the source signal to noise ratio. These results are compared to previous estimates and to theoretical expectations. Also thanks to a new fitting procedure the typical error at 90 % confidence level for a source at a signal to noise of 10 is now estimated to be 1. 5 arcmin. Prospects for future analysis on the Point Spread Function fitting procedure and on the evaluation of residual biases are also presented. The new consolidated parameters describing the source location accuracy that will be derived in the near future using the whole INTEGRAL database, the new fitting technique and the bias correction, will be included in future versions of OSA.
