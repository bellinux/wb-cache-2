25|$|He left a {{reputation}} which has grown steadily both in Britain and internationally. Some commentators consider that his writings are often gnomic and irritating, but never fail to stimulate. He defies categorisation as {{a follower of}} Klein or of Freud. While Bion is most well known outside of the psychoanalytic community {{for his work on}} group dynamics, the psychoanalytic conversation that explores his work is mainly concerned with his theory of thinking, and his model of the development of a capacity <b>for</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
25|$|Of Pandas and People: The Central Question of Biological Origins is a {{controversial}} 1989 (2nd edition 1993) school-level textbook written by Percival Davis and Dean H. Kenyon {{and published by}} the Texas-based Foundation <b>for</b> <b>Thought</b> and Ethics (FTE). The textbook endorses the pseudoscientific concept of intelligent design—namely that life shows evidence of being designed by an intelligent agent which is not named specifically in the book, although proponents understand that {{it refers to the}} Christian God.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, The Mystery of Life's Origin {{was first}} published. It was co-authored by chemist and creationist Charles B. Thaxton with Walter L. Bradley and Roger L.

The work presented scientific arguments against current theories of abiogenesis and offered an hypothesis of special creation instead. While the focus of creation science had until that time centered primarily on the criticism of the fossil evidence for evolution and validation of the creation myth of the Bible, this new work posed the question whether science reveals that even the simplest living systems were far too complex to have developed by natural, unguided processes.|$|E

60|$|Now {{when the}} men of the town saw the {{multitude}} of the soldiers that were come up against the place, and the rams and slings, and the mounts on which they were planted, together with the glittering of the armour and the waving of their colours, they were forced to shift, and shift, and again to shift their thoughts; but they hardly changed <b>for</b> <b>thoughts</b> more stout, but rather <b>for</b> <b>thoughts</b> more faint; <b>for</b> though before they thought themselves sufficiently guarded, yet now they began to think that no man knew what would be their hap or lot.|$|R
25|$|Hercule Poirot {{is enjoying}} a social visit by Dr. Burton, {{a fellow of}} All Souls who recites sonorously some lines from Homer's Iliad (XXIII, 316 f) and turns the {{conversation}} round {{to the subject of}} Poirot's unusual Christian name and how some of the pagan names parents give to their children do not suit their recipients. He thinks about Poirot's and Sherlock Holmes's mothers sitting together and discussing names for their children. Poirot claims ignorance of the legend of Hercules. The talk turns to Poirot's intention to retire after completing a few cases of interest and personal appeal and Burton laughingly refers to the twelve labours of Hercules. This comment gives Poirot pause <b>for</b> <b>thought</b> and after his visitor has gone, Poirot gets acquainted with the exploits of his legendary namesake, deciding his final cases will mimic Hercules's Twelve Labours.|$|E

500|$|According to Taylor, cults {{emphasize}} {{positive aspects}} of the group over negative aspects of outsiders, endlessly repeat simple ideas in [...] "highly reductive, definitive - sounding phrases", and refer to [...] "abstract and ambiguous" [...] ideas associated with [...] "huge emotional baggage". Taylor writes that brainwashing involves a more intense version {{of the way the}} brain traditionally learns. In the final portion of the book, Part III: [...] "Freedom and Control", Taylor describes an individual's susceptibility to brainwashing and lays out an acronym [...] "FACET", a tool to combat influence and a totalist mindset. FACET stands for Freedom, Agency, Complexity, Ends-not-means, and Thinking. The FACET model is based on Lifton's eight criteria <b>for</b> <b>thought</b> reform, and Taylor emphasizes education and freedom of thought as a way to negate some of these criteria.|$|E

Wightman also felt that the line [...] "I thought you'd catch me if I fall and fill me up when I'm empty" [...] signified a lack of support from Hemsworth.

500|$|Anarky's {{introduction}} {{during the}} late 1980s {{was part of a}} larger shift among supervillains in the Batman franchise of the time. While many naive and goofy villains of previous eras were abandoned, and more iconic villains made more violent to cater to tastes of a maturing readership, some were introduced to challenge readers to [...] "question the whole bad/good guy divide." [...] Falling into [...] "the stereotype anarchist bomb-toting image", Anarky's design was countered by his principled stances to create an odd contrast. In a review of the Anarky miniseries, Anarky was dubbed an [...] "anti-villain", as opposed to [...] "antihero", due to his highly principled philosophy, which runs counter to most villains: [...] "In the age of the anti-hero, it only makes sense to have the occasional anti-villain as well. But unlike sociopathic vigilante anti-heroes like the Punisher, an anti-villain like Anarky provides some interesting food <b>for</b> <b>thought.</b> Sure, he breaks the law, but what he really wants is to save the world... and maybe he's right." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1819, Keats had left his job as dresser, or {{assistant}} house surgeon, at Guy's Hospital, Southwark, London, to devote himself entirely to the composition of poetry. Living with his friend Charles Brown, the 23-year-old was burdened with money problems and despaired when his brother George sought his financial assistance. These real-world difficulties may have given Keats pause <b>for</b> <b>thought</b> about a career in poetry, yet he did manage to complete five odes, including [...] "Ode to a Nightingale", [...] "Ode to Psyche", [...] "Ode on Melancholy", [...] "Ode on Indolence", and [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn". The poems were transcribed by Brown, who later provided copies to the publisher Richard Woodhouse. Their exact date of composition is unknown; Keats simply dated [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] May 1819, as he did its companion odes. While the five poems display a unity in stanza forms and themes, the unity fails to provide clear evidence of {{the order in which}} they were composed.|$|E
500|$|... "On {{the night}} before such an event neither Mamma, Pappa, or Daughter Gale could get those minutes' solid sleep <b>for</b> <b>thought</b> {{that they might have}} {{overlooked}} some essential in the guests' comfort. At the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the larder into shape. So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie. First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state, and give it a stir; then Pappa Gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir; finally Daughter Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise. Then arrived the guests. The Minister and the Mrs. Minister, they were, and some neighbors. While she was receiving them the recollection came to Mamma Gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring. Off she speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen. She pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor, and goes back to her guests. Then Pappa Gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored. He, too, excuses himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince. No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than Daughter Gale, who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring, rushes in and makes for the whiskey. She pours 'the right proportion' in, too." ...|$|E
