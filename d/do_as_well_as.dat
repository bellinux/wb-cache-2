5|$|The {{first of}} the B-series trains were {{delivered}} for trial runs on 7 March 2001. In May, NSB stated {{that they would never}} be able to operate the trains with the speeds they had previously stated they could, and that at least for the next year, the tilting trains would operate at the same speeds as conventional trains. On 17 September 2001, the trains were put into service on the Bergen Line between Oslo and Bergen. During the following winter, the trains had problems running through snowdrift unless they were running at a sufficiently high speed. Because part of the Bergen Line had frost heave, trains were forced to drive extra slowly, causing trains to get stuck. NSB stated that tests had shown that Class 73 was better able to do this than El 16, which had previously been the main locomotive on the line, although Class 73 did not <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> the modern El 18. In January 2002, NSB started rebuilding the A-series trains with a larger baggage compartment. This was largely because of insufficient space for passengers to take skis with them.|$|E
5|$|Levine {{confirmed}} in March 2013 {{that the film}} has been officially cancelled. Levine stated that after Warner's Watchmen film in 2009 did not <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> the studio expected, they had concerns with the $200 million budget that Verbinski had for the BioShock film. They asked him to consider doing the film on a smaller $80 million budget, but Verbinski {{did not want to}} accept this. In February 2017, Verbinski said that his crew were about eight weeks from starting filming, with plans for many elaborate sets given that the setting of Rapture could not be something easily shot on existing locations, requiring the $200 million budget. Verbinski was anticipating on releasing the film with an R-rating, when Universal approached him about changing the film's direction. Universal requested that he tone down the film and aim instead for a PG-13 movie, which would be able to draw more audiences to the film and recoup the larger budget he asked for. Verbinski insisted on keeping the R-rating, and refused the smaller budget Universal offered to make the R-rated version. Universal felt that that expensive a film with the limited R-rating would be too much of a risk, and pulled him from the film. Universal then subsequently brought in a new director to work with the smaller budget, but Levine and 2K Games did not feel that the new director was a good fit with the material. Universal then let Levine make the decision to end the project, which he did believing that the film would not work with the current set of compromises {{they would have had to}} make.|$|E

25|$|Very {{little is}} known about the biology of the species, since it was not {{recognized}} as a separate species until after it is believed to have become extinct. Edgar Stead visited Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island in 1936 and made several observations. He described the species as flying no more than “ten feet above the ground” and always after dusk. At one point he found seven bats roosting in a tree cavity in a state of torpor. After capturing a few and putting them in a cage they crawled around on the floor, much like New Zealand lesser short-tailed bats are known to <b>do.</b> <b>As</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> roosting in tree cavities, it is known that they roosted in granite caves on Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island and Rerewhakaupoko/Solomon Island.|$|E
25|$|The next year, in 1993, Karam {{signed with}} another record label {{for her new}} album. This time it was an even less-known Saudi Arabian company. The new album was called Ana Ma'akon ("I am with you"). The album was classic in style and quite {{different}} from Shams el-Ghinnieh, not really reflecting Najwa's artistic identity. Despite her personal discontent, {{she had no choice}} but release it, bound by a contract with her production company. As expected, the album failed to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> Shams el-Ghinnieh. Poor marketing and lack of resources did not help much either and were blamed for the low sales of the album. It remains Karam's least-known album, although many of her fans consider it the best, in terms of showing Najwa's abilities and voice-power.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine {{can have}} {{multiple}} effects at the cellular level but is primarily notable for the alertness effect {{that it has}} on people. Research has been performed involving phonological priming and TOTs in which participants took either 200mg of caffeine or a placebo. The participants answered 100 general knowledge questions, each with one correct answer. For each question, participants read 10 priming words that were displayed on a monitor {{for a short period}} of time. Each list of 10 priming words had between two and eight words that were phonologically related to the correct answer of the question, with the remaining words being unrelated. Caffeinated participants had fewer TOT experiences than the placebo group, suggesting better memory recall. However, in the unrelated condition, the caffeinated group did not <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> the placebo group in their ability to retrieve words. The results suggest that this dose of caffeine (equivalent to two cups of coffee) can temporarily hinder a person’s short-term recall of certain words. Moreover, the general advantageous effect of caffeine on attention can be ruled out.|$|E

500|$|Led Zeppelin {{have been}} {{credited}} with {{a major impact on}} the nature of the music business, particularly in the development of album-orientated rock (AOR) and stadium rock. In 1988 John Kalodner, then-A executive of Geffen Records, remarked that [...] "In my opinion, next to the Beatles they're the most influential band in history. They influence the way music is on records, AOR radio, concerts. They set the standards for the AOR-radio format with 'Stairway to Heaven,' having AOR hits without necessarily having Top 40 hits. They're the ones who did the first real big arena concert shows, consistently selling out and playing stadiums without support. People can <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> them, but nobody surpasses them". Andrew Loog Oldham, the former producer and manager of the Rolling Stones, commented on how Led Zeppelin had a major influence on the record business, and the way rock concerts were managed and presented to huge audiences.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick's {{attention}} to music was {{an aspect of}} what many referred to as his [...] "perfectionism" [...] and extreme {{attention to}} minute details, which his wife Christiane attributed to an addiction to music. In his last six films, Kubrick usually chose music from existing sources, especially classical compositions. He preferred selecting recorded music over having it composed for a film, believing that no hired composer could <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> the public domain classical composers. He also felt that building scenes from great music often created the [...] "most memorable scenes" [...] in the best films. In one instance, for a scene in Barry Lyndon which was written into the screenplay as merely, [...] "Barry duels with Lord Bullingdon", he spent forty-two working days in the editing phase. During that period, he listened to what LoBrutto describes as [...] "every available recording of seventeenth-and eighteenth- century music, acquiring thousands of records to find Handel's sarabande used to score the scene". Jack Nicholson likewise observed his attention to music for his films, stating that Kubrick [...] "listened constantly to music until he discovered something he felt was right or that excited him".|$|E
500|$|The {{second season}} of Homicide drew several {{comparisons}} to NYPD Blue, an ABC police drama series that had debuted in September 1993. It received {{a large amount}} of publicity and better ratings than Homicide, which some reviewers attributed to the violence and nudity featured in the show. Like Homicide, NYPD Blue featured an ensemble cast and intertwined subplots, and commentators suggested its success may have encouraged NBC to support Homicide. Levinson said he was not deterred by comparisons to NYPD Blue because Homicide debuted before that series. In a news article, Fontana quoted a friend who described NYPD Blue as [...] "the television version of Homicide". Baldwin was even more critical of the show, and said in an interview: [...] "The ultimate compliment that can ever be paid [...] to be mimicked by someone else. So, thank you, NYPD Blue, because it's the knockoff of Homicide." [...] NYPD Blue co-creator Steven Bochco took exception to that characterization, saying he believed his reputation and experience in television proved he was capable of conceiving his own material. Bochco said: I don't think it's a knock-off. It was conceived as its own show. I wish Homicide the best [...] and they should be so lucky as to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> we're doing right now." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the middle}} of August 1797, after six weeks of {{constant}} easterly winds that kept his ships trapped in their harbour, De Winter decided that an attempt to join the French at Brest as {{the first stage of}} an invasion of Ireland was impractical and he abandoned the plan. In part this decision was due to the strength of Duncan's reconstituted fleet, which had increased to 17 ships of the line with the addition of the vessels returned from the Nore. Duncan's men were also better trained and more experienced than their Dutch counterparts, having spent considerably longer at sea and having been taught to fire three rounds a minute to the Dutch two. In addition to his concerns about the proficiency of his men, De Winter was also worried about their loyalty: the dominion of France over the Batavian Republic and the country's enforced participation in distant theatres of warfare were unpopular among the Dutch people. Although De Winter was an avowed republican, who had fought in the French Army against the Netherlands between 1793 and 1795, support for the House of Orange remained strong among the Dutch population and with the fleet's sailors. Wolfe Tone wrote in frustration that [...] "The destiny of Europe might have been changed for ever [...] [...] [...] the great occasion is lost, and we must <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> we can." ...|$|E

Something tells me that it will not be the case, and [...] will be seen in a fourth, or fifth."

Jefferson particularly thought Adams should write the document; but Adams persuaded the Committee to choose Jefferson while agreeing to consult with Jefferson personally. Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson on the question: Jefferson asked, [...] "Why will you not? You ought to do it." [...] To which Adams responded, [...] "I will not – reasons enough." [...] Jefferson replied, [...] "What can be your reasons?" [...] And Adams responded, [...] "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear {{at the head of}} this business. Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can." [...] "Well," [...] said Jefferson, [...] "if you are decided, I will <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> I can." [...] Adams concluded, [...] "Very well. When you have drawn it up, we will have a meeting." [...] The Committee left no minutes, and the drafting process itself is uncertain – accounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, although frequently cited, are otherwise contradictory. Although the first draft was written primarily by Jefferson, Adams assumed a primary role in its completion. After editing the document further, Congress approved it on July 4. Many years later Jefferson hailed Adams as [...] "the pillar of [...] support on the floor of Congress, [...] ablest advocate and defender against the multifarious assaults it encountered." ...|$|E
