Critic Alice Goldfarb Marquis writes that the artist recalled {{one of his sons}} pointing to a comic book and challenging; [...] "I bet you can't paint as good as that". Another says that the painting resulted from an effort to prove his abilities to both his son and his son's classmates who mocked Lichtenstein's hard-to-fathom abstracts. American painter Allan Kaprow once stated, in reference to a Bazooka <b>Dubble</b> Bubble Gum wrapper, to Lichtenstein, [...] "You can't teach color from Cézanne, you can only teach it from something like this." [...] Lichtenstein then showed him one of his Donald Duck images.|$|E

Motivation Consider a family of smooth systems xn+ 1 = f ff (x n), xn 2 R k,k 2. For simplicity we assume that f ff is a one-parameter family. Assume that f ff has a stable fixed point for ff ! ff 0, and that the fixed point looses its stability at ff = ff 0. This can happen in several different ways. The figure below shows three different ways the eigenvalues of Df ff 0 (x) can pass through the unit circle. Figure 1 To the left a single eigenvalue is passing through at the real axis at 1 resulting in a saddle-node bifurcation causing the fixed point to disappear.

Despite {{the deaths of the}} two most {{important}} generals of the early Trần dynasty, Trần Quang Khải in 1294 and Trần Quốc Tuấn in 1300, the Emperor was still served by many efficient mandarins like Trần Nhật Duật, Đoàn Nhữ Hài, Phạm Ngũ Lão, Trương Hán Siêu, Mạc Đĩnh Chi and Nguyễn Trung Ngạn. Anh Tông was very strict in suppressing gambling and corruption but he also generously rewarded those who served him well. Under the reign of an able emperor and capable court administration, Đại Việt witnessed a long period of peace and prosperity.Foreign policy during Anh Tông's reign was continuing the détente with the Yuan dynasty while restraining the two other neighbours of Đại Việt, the kingdoms of Champa and Laos. The Emperor's envoy to the Yuan dynasty was so successful that the leader Mạc Đĩnh Chi was <b>dubbled</b> the [...] "Two-state exemplar" [...] because he came first as Trạng nguyên (Zhuangyuan, 狀元) in Đại Việt's imperial examination and was praised in the Yuan dynasty court for his eloquence.

6000|$|For {{the fine}} arts, and {{especially}} for the belles-lettres, he entertained a profound contempt. With this he had been inspired by Casimir Perier, whose pert little query [...] "A quoi un poete est il bon?" [...] {{he was in the}} habit of quoting, with a very droll pronunciation, as the ne plus ultra of logical wit. Thus my own inkling for the Muses had excited his entire displeasure. He assured me one day, when I asked him for a new copy of Horace, that the translation of [...] "Poeta nascitur non fit" [...] was [...] "a nasty poet for nothing fit"--a remark which I took in high dudgeon. His repugnance to [...] "the humanities" [...] had, also, much increased of late, by an accidental bias in favor of what he supposed to be natural science. Somebody had accosted him in the street, mistaking him for no less a personage than Doctor <b>Dubble</b> L. Dee, the lecturer upon quack physics. This set him off at a tangent; and just at the epoch of this story--for story it is getting to be after all--my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon was accessible and pacific only upon points which happened to chime in with the caprioles of the hobby he was riding. For the rest, he laughed with his arms and legs, and his politics were stubborn and easily understood.

60|$|The ladies, if {{they hated}} befoar, {{you may be}} sure detested each other now wuss than ever.

She liked Deuceace, who amused her and made her laff.

Miss's love, on the contry, was all flams and fury. She'd always been at this work from the time she had been at school, where she very nigh run away with a Frentch master; next with a footman (which I may say, in confidence, is by no means unnatral or unusyouall, as I COULD SHOW IF I LIKED); and so had been going on sins fifteen. She reglarly flung herself at Deuceace's head--such sighing, crying, and ogling, I never see. Often was I ready to bust out laffin, as I brought master skoars of rose-colored billydoos, folded up like cockhats, and smellin like barber's shops, which this very tender young lady used to address to him.

5000|$|The {{original}} gum {{featured a}} color comic strip, {{known as the}} Fleer Funnies, which was included with the gum. The featured characters, ‘Dub and Bub’, were introduced in 1930 but were replaced by the iconic Pud and his pals in 1950. Originally, Pud was much more rotund than the slimmed down version seen in the 1960s. The early comics were especially large and colorful. The comic also included Fleer Fortunes and <b>Dubble</b> Bubble Facts. The comics were sequentially numbered which made collecting them easy. They are not dated though, so {{it is difficult to}} know the exact year of release. By the late 1950s, early 1960s, Fleer Funnies shrank to the small size most people remember. More than 1,002 comics have been released over the years. During World War II, <b>Dubble</b> Bubble was distributed to the military. Sugar and latex became scarce due to the war and bubble gum manufacturing was halted in 1942. In 1951 Fleer resumed manufacturing of <b>Dubble</b> Bubble and the popularity of its gum grew steadily. Over time, Fleer extended its reach by adding new flavors and new formats like ball gum and expanded distribution of its products overseas. [...] In 1957 Fleer introduced the first gum 6-pack with <b>Dubble</b> Bubble. In 1998, <b>Dubble</b> Bubble was purchased by Concord Confections and in 1999 they introduced <b>Dubble</b> Bubble as a gumball.
