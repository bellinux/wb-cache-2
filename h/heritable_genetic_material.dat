50|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{is a process}} that alters the genetic make-up of an organism by either removing or introducing DNA. DNA can be introduced directly into the host organism or into a cell that is then fused or hybridized with the host. This relies on recombinant nucleic acid techniques to form new combinations of <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> followed by the incorporation of that material either indirectly through a vector system or directly through micro-injection, macro-injection or micro-encapsulation.|$|E
40|$|<b>Heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> {{diseases}} can {{be prevented}} {{with the use of}} donor oocytes. We report our experience in using donor oocytes from anonymous, matched, fertile donors in four women with <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> disorders. Our results show that use of donor oocytes is a practical, successful, and currently available technique for the prevention of genetic disorders...|$|R
5|$|A {{prerequisite}} for natural selection {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation {{is the presence of}} <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|R
50|$|The Giraavarus were {{isolated}} and thus an endogamous society {{with a relatively}} low population {{for more than a}} millennium. As a result, the population showed a number of <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> disorders when they were forcibly assimilated with the larger population in the 1940's.|$|R
25|$|As {{with other}} CrVI compounds, {{potassium}} dichromate is carcinogenic {{and should be}} handled with gloves and appropriate health and safety protection. The compound is also corrosive and exposure may produce severe eye damage or blindness. Human exposure further encompasses impaired fertility, <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> damage and harm to unborn children.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, {{the defect}} {{is linked to}} {{mutations}} of the EMX2, SIX3, and Collagen, type IV, alpha 1 genes.

50|$|Many {{case studies}} clearly {{demonstrate}} {{the importance of}} an organism's associated microbiota to its existence. (For example, see the numerous case studies in the Microbiome article.) However, horizontal versus vertical transmission of endosymbionts must be distinguished. Endosymbionts whose transmission is predominantly vertical may be considered as contributing to the <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> variation present in a host species.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} theory behind {{the origin of}} mirror neuron is the genetic account which {{suggests}} that the mirrorness of mirror neurons is due primarily to <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> factors and that the genetic predisposition to develop Mirror neuron evolved because they facilitate action understanding.The other theories as to the origin of mirror neurons include Associative Learning, Canalization and Exaptation.|$|R

40|$|Familial {{factors related}} to suicide can be {{categorized}} as environmental, <b>heritable</b> (<b>genetic),</b> and interactions of the two. Many familial risk and protective factors in suicide are interrelated, {{and it is difficult}} to determine whether a trait is directly associated with suicide and what proportion of that trait is heritable. Research in this area is ongoing, and knowledge is evolving rapidly...|$|R
50|$|Phenotypic {{variation}} (due to underlying <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> variation) is {{a fundamental}} prerequisite for evolution by natural selection. It is the living organism as a whole that contributes (or not) to the next generation, so natural selection affects the genetic structure of a population indirectly via the contribution of phenotypes. Without phenotypic variation, {{there would be no}} evolution by natural selection.|$|R
40|$|Aneurysms are {{characterized}} by structural deterioration of the vascular wall leading to progressive dilatation and, potentially, rupture of the aorta. While aortic aneurysms often remain clinically silent, the morbidity and mortality associated with aneurysm expansion and rupture are considerable. Over 13, 000 deaths annually in the United States are attributable to aortic aneurysm rupture with less than 1 in 3 persons with aortic aneurysm rupture surviving to surgical intervention. Environmental and epidemiologic risk factors including smoking, male gender, hypertension, older age, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and family history are highly associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms, while <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> mutations are commonly associated with aneurysms of the thoracic aorta. Similar {{to other forms of}} cardiovascular disease, family history, <b>genetic</b> variation, and <b>heritable</b> mutations modify the risk of aortic aneurysm formation and provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of human aortic aneurysms. This review will examine the relationship between <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> and epigenetic influences on thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm formation and rupture...|$|R
40|$|Therapeutic gene transfer, or “gene therapy ” was {{originally}} proposed {{as a means}} of curing <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> defects through the transfer of a normal gene to replace the defective function of a mutant gene [1].

50|$|In {{children}} with the <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> form of retinoblastoma there is a mutation in the RB1 gene on chromosome 13. RB1 was the first tumor suppressor gene cloned. Although RB1 interacts with over 100 cell proteins, its negative regulator effect on the cell cycle principally arises from binding and inactivation of the transcription factor E2F, thus repressing the transcription of genes which are required for the S phase.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} serum porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) N protein-specific IgG levels from sera collected from 464 Large White-Landrace commercial crossbred piglets from three separate experimental infection trials with PRRSV isolate NVSL- 97 - 7895. IgG levels at 42 days post infection (dpi) were measured by fluorescent microsphere immunoassay, herein {{referred to as}} total antibody (tAb) response. tAb levels were assessed for an association with different disease-related traits, {{the presence of a}} <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> component, and for genomic regions associated with tAb response. tAb response was negatively associated with viral load (VL) and weight gain from 28 - 42 dpi (WG) and positively associated with virus rebound (REB) and neutralizing antibody (nAb) levels. Furthermore, tAb response had a <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> component, with a major QTL located on chromosome 7 in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), whereby heterozygous individuals had a lower tAb response and increased weight gain from 28 - 42 dpi. These results suggest that genetic selection for tAb response may be useful for selecting for pigs that have increased resistance or reduced susceptibility to PRRSV...|$|R
50|$|The DNA of an {{individual}} is the same in somatic (nonreproductive) cell. Sexual reproduction brings the DNA of both parents together randomly to create a unique combination of <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> in a new cell, so the <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> of {{an individual}} {{is derived from the}} <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> of both their parents in equal amounts. This <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> is known as the nuclear genome of the individual, because it is found in the nucleus.|$|R
25|$|Prokaryotic <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> is {{organized}} {{in a simple}} circular DNA molecule (the bacterial chromosome) in the nucleoid region of the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> is divided into different, linear molecules called chromosomes inside a discrete nucleus, usually with additional <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> in some organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts (see endosymbiotic theory).|$|R
25|$|Plant-{{incorporated}} protectants (PIPs) have <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> {{from other}} species incorporated into their <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> (i.e. GM crops). Their use is controversial, especially in many European countries.|$|R
40|$|Less than {{a quarter}} of {{reintroduction}} programs have succeeded in re-establishing a self-sustaining population of an extirpated species. Optimal source population selection, based on an evolutionary perspective, could increase the fitness of translocated individuals, thereby improving the success rate of restoring extirpated populations. Here, using three source populations of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar (LaHave River, Sebago Lake, and Lac Saint-Jean), that are being used for reintroduction efforts into Lake Ontario, I examined two optimal source population selection approaches: environment matching and adaptive potential. For environment matching, source populations from locations containing similar key environment features as the reintroduction location should contain adaptations to these features. For adaptive potential, source populations with high <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> variation should have the potential to adapt to new selection pressures, such as the key environment features in the reintroduction location. I tested environment matching using experimental settings by exposing the three source populations to two key environment features that are likely impediments to a successful reintroduction of Atlantic salmon into Lake Ontario: the presence of non-native salmonids and a high thiaminase diet that can lead to a thiamine (vitamin B 1) deficiency. I also quantified the amount of within-population <b>heritable</b> (additive) <b>genetic</b> variation for early-life history traits to assess the adaptive potential of the source populations. Although the average amount of <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> variation was the highest for early-life history traits of the Sebago population, the amount was low, suggesting that the traits have a limited potential to adapt to any new selection pressures in Lake Ontario. Overall, the Sebago population (a match to both key environment features) had the highest performance, followed by the Saint-Jean population (match to a high thiaminase diet but not non-native salmonids), and finally the LaHave population (not a match to either feature). The pattern of overall performance and the low amount of <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> variation of the three source populations generally supports environment matching over adaptive potential; however, further population comparisons are required over the entire life-cycle and in a fully natural setting to make more robust recommendations for large scale reintroduction efforts of Atlantic salmon into Lake Ontario...|$|R

Living organisms undergo metabolism, maintain homeostasis, possess a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, reproduce and, through natural selection, adapt to their environment in successive generations. More complex living organisms can communicate through various means.|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the corrosive interplay between the patent-based and the sovereign- based systems of ownership of <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> In patent-based systems, <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> is increasingly “owned” by corporations or research institutions which obtain patents over such material. In sovereign-based systems, {{the national government}} owns or extensively controls such material. As more patents issue for synthesized genes in developed countries through the patent system, more raw <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> is legally enclosed by the governments of developing nations, which house most of the world’s wild or raw <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> This interactive spiral of increased enclosure results in the sub-optimal utilization, conservation and improvement of vital <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> This article adds to the scholarship that critiques the patenting of <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> in the United States {{by focusing on the}} international collateral damage occasioned by overbroad patenting in this area. In addition, it takes the first comprehensive critical look at the sovereign-based system. It argues that sovereign ownership or extensive control over <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> (i) risks creating an anticommons in raw <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> (ii) threatens the liberty and autonomy of individuals and indigenous communities whose property contains such material and (iii) is premised on a flawed approach in international law that has led to broad and unenforceable regimes that will increase tensions between nations. Moreover, the interaction between the patent-based and the sovereign-based systems risks setting off a major trade dispute under the TRIPS Agreement. To repair this situation, I propose a framework for a more open system for <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> I recommend that the United States take into account the adverse reaction of other countries when determining as a utilitarian matter whether and, if so, to what extent to allow patents for <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> Expansive patent rights over <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> can cause innovation in the biotechnology field to fall to suboptimal levels because they cause sovereigns in the world’s most genetically diverse nations to curtail access to the raw material that contributes to such innovation. For their part, genetically-rich developing countries should, inter alia, adopt more selective and value-added approaches to enclosure...|$|R
