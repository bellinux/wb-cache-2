This {{is compatible with the}} fact that photographs of Milichiidae on prey, almost universally show them on insects that provide such olfactory clues. This would be compatible with the idea that predators that commonly hunt prey that release a dramatic and characteristic olfactory signal, thereby create a niche for suitable kleptoparasites. In at least species that are attracted to prey of Nephilinae in Florida, the major attractants released by Heteropteran prey appear to be low-molecular-weight carbonyl compounds, among which trans-2-hexenal and <b>hexanal</b> are prominent. These compounds are not conspicuous among those released by captured honeybees, so other classes of attractants are likely to be significant as well. In general there is suggestive evidence that the kleptoparasitism relies on olfactory clues; for example, some species seem to operate in the dark, and photographs of approaching flies seem to show them flying upwind, which is consistent with scent following.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate and describe the emissions of volatile compounds, particularly <b>hexanal</b> and carbon monoxide, from large- and small-scale storage of wood pellets. Methods: Air sampling was performed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and adsorbent sampling in pellet warehouses, domestic storage rooms, lumber kiln dryers and experimental set-ups. Literature studies were included to describe the formation of <b>hexanal</b> and carbon monoxide and the toxicology of <b>hexanal.</b> Results: A geometric mean aldehyde level of 111 Â± 32 mg/m 3 was found in one warehouse, with a peak reading of 156 mg/m 3. A maximum aldehyde reading of 457 mg/m 3 was recorded at the surface of a pellet pile. <b>Hexanal</b> (70 - 80 % w/w) and pentanal (10 - 15 % w/w) dominated, but acetone (83 Â± 24 mg/m 3), methanol (18 Â± 7 mg/m 3) and carbon monoxide (56 Â± 4 mg/m 3) were also found. The emissions in a domestic storage room varied with the ambient temperature and peaked after 2 months storage in the midst of the warm season. Aldehyde levels of 98 Â± 4 mg/m 3 and carbon monoxide levels of 123 Â± 10 mg/m 3 were recorded inside such storage rooms. Elevated levels of <b>hexanal</b> (0. 084 mg/m 3) were recorded inside domestic housing and 6 mg/m 3 in a room adjacent to a poorly sealed storage area. Experimental laboratory studies confirmed the findings of the field studies. A field study of the emissions from industrial lumber drying also showed the formation of aldehydes and carbon monoxide. Conclusions: High levels of <b>hexanal</b> and carbon monoxide were strongly associated with storage of wood pellets and may constitute an occupational and domestic health hazard. The results from lumber drying show that the emissions of <b>hexanal</b> and carbon monoxide are not limited to wood pellets but are caused by general degradation processes of wood, facilitated by drying at elevated temperature.

Literature studies were included to describe the formation of <b>hexanal</b> and carbon monoxide and the toxicology of <b>hexanal.</b> Results: A geometric mean aldehyde level of 111 Â± 32 mg/m 3 was found in one warehouse, with a peak reading of 156 mg/m 3. A maximum aldehyde reading of 457 mg/m 3 was recorded at the surface of a pellet pile. <b>Hexanal</b> (70 â 80 % w/w) and pentanal (10 â 15 % w/w) dominated, but acetone (83 Â± 24 mg/m 3), methanol (18 Â± 7 mg/m 3) and carbon monoxide (56 Â± 4 mg/m 3) were also found. The emissions in a domestic storage room varied with the ambient temper-ature and peaked after 2 months storage in the midst of the warm season. Aldehyde levels of 98 Â± 4 mg/m 3 and carbon monoxide levels of 123 Â± 10 mg/m 3 were recorded inside such storage rooms. Elevated levels of <b>hexanal</b> (0. 084 mg/m 3) were recorded inside domestic housing an...|$|E
40|$|In a light-dependent {{reaction}} (3. 5 kilolux) at pH 5, {{the evolution}} of <b>hexanal,</b> ethane, and ethylene has been established with cell suspensions of the diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum. During this process, chlorophyll and carotenoids are partially bleached. Addition of 25 millimolar Î±-linolenic acid or 12 millimolar docosahexaenoic acid yield total pigment destruction and enhancement of ethylene and ethane formation (by about 150 and 7, 600 %, respectively), whereas <b>hexanal</b> production decreases by 70 %. Eicosapentaenoic acid, the major polyunsaturated fatty acid in diatoms, stimulates both ethane and <b>hexanal</b> formation (by about 1, 400 and 130 %, respectively), but reduces ethylene production (by about 60 %). This competition suggests that {{the production of the}} volatile compounds is closely connected, although <b>hexanal</b> and ethylene obviously possess different unsaturated fatty acids as precursors. Both the kind of the fatty acids and their relative amounts seem to determine the pattern of the evolved hydrocarbons. The presence of 10 millimolar propylgallate inhibits {{the evolution of}} the volatile compounds by about 80 %, indicating that radical formation might {{play a key role in}} this light-dependent cascade of reactions...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-two {{experienced}} panelists rated {{odor intensity}} of aqueous solutions of citral, octen- 1 -ol- 3, and <b>hexanal.</b> The panel assessed unmixed components andmixtures (9 binary and 4 ternary). In sensory sessions dedicated tomixtures (n = 6), evaluation {{was focused on}} one target odor, presented at a fixed concentration. All components had lower odor intensity on mixed pre-sentations. In many cases, information obtained from simpler systems was not extended to complex mixtures. In a mixture, the competition between odorant molecules on qualitative aspects (dominance/suppression) imbalanced components contribution, anticipated from the quantitative distribution. <b>Hexanal</b> {{appeared to be the}} potentially weaker odorant in paired combinations, whereas octen- 1 -ol- 3 had a lower relative impact on ternary systems. Suppression of the odor of octen- 1 -ol- 3 and a concomitant increase in the odor of <b>hexanal</b> was common to all ternary mixtures. Reciprocal inhibition of octen- 1 -ol- 3 and citral odors through perceptual interactions was suspected. Mutual suppression is suspected to have eased the perception of <b>hexanal</b> intensity. Key words: aroma balance, masking, mixed odorants, odor intensity, odor suppressio...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalyst}} activity of solid acids such as niobium phosphate and Amberlyst 35, an ion exchange resin, was evaluated in the acetalization of <b>hexanal</b> with 2 -ethyl-hexanol. The catalyst loading {{and the reaction}} temperature were evaluated in the <b>hexanal</b> conversions. The possibility of recycling niobium phosphate was also studied, showing {{that it was possible}} to reuse this catalyst without significant loss in its catalytic activity. The yield in acetal was above 90 % under mild conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{work was}} carried out {{with the purpose of}} verifying the {{biochemical}} changes associated to soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) seeds osmoconditioning. Seeds of the UFV 10, IAC 8 and Doko RC cultivars harvested at R 8 development stage and submitted to different treatments were used. The biochemical evaluations were performed during seed storage, after the hydration-dehydration process. Initially, seeds were osmoconditioned in a polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) solution, with the osmotic potential of - 0. 8 MPa and 20 ÂºC, for a period of four days. After that, seeds were dried back until the initial moisture content (10 - 11 %) and stored in natural conditions for three and six months. Two controls were used: untreated seeds (dry seeds) and water soaked seeds. Seed changes in protein and lipid, <b>hexanal</b> accumulation and fatty acids contents were evaluated. The results showed that seed storage under laboratory natural conditions caused reduction in protein, lipid and polyunsaturated fatty acids content and promoted <b>hexanal</b> production. Storage periods reduced protein levels for all treatments, however the PEG 6000 treatment showed lower protein reduction. The soybean seed storage increased <b>hexanal</b> production, but <b>hexanal</b> levels were smaller with osmoconditioning comparing to the other imbibition treatments...|$|E
40|$|Influence of {{dialysis}} on plasma {{lipid peroxidation}} products and antioxidant levels. In patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRF), {{the incidence of}} atherosclerosis and cancer is increased. The importance of lipid peroxidation (LPO) products in the pathogenesis of these complications has recently been emphasized. The LPO products malondialdehyde (MDA) and <b>hexanal,</b> lipophilic antioxidants and erythrocyte glutathione (GSH) were estimated in 10 pediatric hemodialysis (HD) patients before and after HD and in 11 peritoneal dialysis (CPD) patients. Before HD, MDA was elevated [median (interquartile range) : 384. 5 (110 to 501) nM; normal < 150 nM], whereas plasma <b>hexanal</b> levels were normal in all patients [130. 5 (88 to 222) nM; < 320 nM]. HD decreased MDA concentrations on average by 88 % but did not change <b>hexanal</b> levels. CPD patients exhibited high plasma MDA concentrations [371 (287 to 468) nM], whereas <b>hexanal</b> was in the low normal range [56 (51 to 80) nM]. Antioxidants were normal in both groups and unchanged during HD. GSH decreased slightly during HD. We hypothesize that MDA may accumulate in ESRF due to reduced plasma clearance. Our results argue against a general increase of LPO in uremia...|$|E
40|$|Alkyd paints emit over {{a period}} of several weeks after {{application}} under normal conditions (room temperature and relative humidity of 50 %) substances which have a negative impact on the Indoor Air Quality. In the present work, fast and robust methods for the qualitative and quantitative determination of the VOC - emitter (<b>hexanal</b> and caproic acid) during the drying of alkyd paints were developed. For this test, a so called "test chamber"' (according to the AgBB scheme) and a micro - chamber from Markes were used. In addition, the distribution - and diffusion coefficients of the emitters formed in situ were determined, to get a competent knowledge of their emission rates and thereby an improved interpretation of the emission profiles. The diffusion coefficient was determined in a static and dynamic system with the help of a new application and manufacturing method of the coating samples. Furthermore, a physicochemical approach was used to reduce the solubility of <b>hexanal</b> in the coating matrix. The dwell time of <b>hexanal</b> in the paint matrix is reduced and thus less <b>hexanal</b> is autoxidized to caproic acid. According to this, the contamination of indoor air by the drying of alkyd resin is lowered...|$|E
40|$|The aroma {{compositions}} of oxidised sunflower oil, {{linseed oil}} and a blend thereof (85 / 15) {{were compared with}} frequently used indicators for primary and secondary lipid oxidation. Primary lipid oxidation {{was followed by the}} formation of conjugated dienes, secondary lipid oxidation by proponal and <b>hexanal</b> formation. Highest concentrations of conjugated dienes and propanal were measured in the linseed oil, followed by the blend and sunflower oil, respectively. Highest concentrations of <b>hexanal</b> were determined in the blend. At similar primary oxidation levels, volatile compounds of the oils were isolated in a model mouth system and subsequently analysed by gas chromatography/sniffing port analysis. Propanal, pentanal, 1 -penten- 3 -one, <b>hexanal,</b> 1 -pentanol, octanal, 1 -octen- 3 -one, 1 -octen- 3 -ol and (E,Z) - 2, 4 -heptadienal possessed detectable odours. Comparing the three oils, most aroma compounds and greatest intensities were determined in the blend. Conjugated diene concentrations did not predict the formation of aroma compounds adequately. Although propanal and <b>hexanal</b> concentrations were reasonable indicators for aroma development in linseed and sunflower oil, respectively, neither of the indicators predicted aroma development in all three oils sufficiently...|$|E
