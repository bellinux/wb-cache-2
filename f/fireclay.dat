Clays rich in kaolinite containing higher than 1.2 % of total Fe 2 O 3 and TiO 2 are classified as Seger 2 clays, which are adequate for manufacturing colored and heavy clay-based ceramics and aluminosilicate refractories.

40|$|Historically, miners {{have known}} that roof rocks {{originally}} composed largely of mud were prone to slaking and deterioration when exposed to water and humidity. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) records show that roof falls are more prevalent in summer and late fall. Field data shows higher bolt loads and increased room convergence in summer months. Laboratory data shows that very high internal pressures can be generated by significant strain in clay-rich rocks. In summer months humidities ranging from 70 - 100 % can cause rock strains up to 7 %, and rock pressures of 14, 000 psi, {{more than enough to}} break apart weak shales and <b>fireclays.</b> The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted wet/dry immersion cycling of clay-rich rocks. Results show that the rocks most prone to moisture deterioration are <b>fireclays,</b> claystones, and sandy shales, all of which have disrupted bedding. Of the 7 mudrocks with a weatherability index above 40 %, none showed consistent fissile bedding. Black shales were surprisingly resistant to wet/dry water immersion cycling. Generally, mixed rocks (stackrock), typically susceptible to horizontal stress, are more resistant to moisture-deterioration. Mine roof rocks tested with moisture sensitivity ratings above 50 % (moisture sensitivity index ranges from 0 - 100 with 100 being the most sensitive) all came from mines which had roof skin problems and used supplemental support to prevent rock fall injuries. Some roof rocks showed lateral variability of moisture sensitivity values, suggesting the need for more samples in highly varying roof rocks. Swelling strains of mudrocks showed that almost all of the swelling occurred in the first 24 hours after immersion. The wet/dry immersion cycling test used provides an accurate, quick and inexpensive method for estimating the moisture sensitivity of mudrocks.

40|$|Historically, {{coal miners}} {{have known that}} roof shales can {{deteriorate}} in contact with humid mine air, causing massive roof falls and injuries from falling rock. It is critical to recognize rocks prone to weathering and to adequately support these rocks {{in order to ensure}} the long-term stability of the openings. In a recent study, NIOSH has used a wet/dry cycling test to determine the moisture sensitivity of over 800 specimens of roof rock from 25 U. S. coal mines. <b>Fireclays</b> and some gray shales are the most moisture-sensitive. Rocks with disturbed bedding, in contrast to flat-bedded rocks, are also more sensitive to water. Black shales are relatively un-reactive to moisture and serve to protect more reactive gray shales above. Mines that have roof rocks with moisture-sensitivity indexes above 40 % can experience slaking roof conditions, and many require high coverage surface controls. Three case studies are presented in which the moisture-sensitivity index is correlated to roof conditions underground, and can be used to indicate long term deterioration.

South African kaolins, ball clays, <b>fireclays,</b> miscellaneous clays, grogs, bentonites, felspathic materials, alkaline earths, silica, refractory materials (other than clays) and mineral pigments are dealt with. A limited selection of foreign materials, frequently referred to in studio-potter publications, was also used in comparative tests. The materials are recorded with reference to the ultimate analysis, seger formula, proximate analysis (where applicable), properties and results of trials using the materials in clay bodies and/or glazes. It was demonstrated that South African materials are largely of good quality e. g. kaolin, felspars and silica. Variability of clay supplies because of lack of stockpiling and blending practices, especially by small suppliers, is often a problem.

Bricks and feed materials will be tested for compliance with market specifications and for leachability of pollutants derived from fly ash. The laboratory study will combine ISGS databases, ICCI-supported characterization methods, and published information to improve predictions of the firing characteristics of Illinois fly ash and brick clay mixtures. Because identical methods are used to test clay firing and coal ash fusion, and because melting mechanisms are the same, improved coal ash fusion predictions are and additional expected result of this research.

The audit began with a review of the available geodiversity documentation for East Dunbartonshire including BGS field maps, databases, digital aerial photography and publications, SNH SSSI and GCR documentation, and site information from the Strathclyde RIGS Group. An initial list of 59 sites with potential for geodiversity value was compiled from this information. A total of 36 sites from the initial list were visited and audited, most during March and April 2009. Information was recorded on the GeoDiversitY scoring system, developed by BGS. In this system, geological scientific merit, education value, community site value, cultural/heritage/economic importance, access, site fragility, potential are assessed. The GeoDiversitY system was accessed via digital data entry forms on the BGS SIGMA Mobile system running on a ruggedized field notebook PC. Of the 36 sites visited, 34 are recommended as Local Geodiversity Sites. These sites have a good geographical spread across East Dunbartonshire, encompassing both urban and rural areas. Together they show typical geological strata, structure and features of all the geological units present immediately beneath the surface of East Dunbartonshire and are representative examples of the Carboniferous sequence which underlies much of Central Scotland. The sites, chosen primarily for their geology, have revealed numerous links to the character of the landscape, historical structures, ecology, and the economic and cultural history of the area.
