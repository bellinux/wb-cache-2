5|$|Election day, 5 April, was {{relatively}} free of major incidents and irregularities. Minor violations included officials helping elderly voters cast and submit ballots.

5|$|In July 2010, Minnesota Majority, a {{conservative}} watchdog group, {{conducted a study}} in which they flagged 2,803 voters for examination, including some 1,359 they suspected were ineligible convicted felons in the largely Democratic Minneapolis–St. Paul area who voted illegally in the Senate race. Subsequent investigations of Minnesota Majority's claims by <b>election</b> <b>officials</b> found that many of their allegations were incorrect.|$|E

Sixteen days later, however, they certified Santorum {{as the winner}} by a 34-vote margin. A week after the Iowa caucuses, Romney earned a decisive win in the New Hampshire primary {{with a total of}} 39percent of the vote; Paul finished second and Jon Huntsman, Jr. third.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these acts}} helped empower courts to remedy {{violations}} of federal voting rights, strict legal standards {{made it difficult}} for the Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation. For example, to win a discrimination lawsuit against a state that maintained a literacy test, the Department needed to prove that the rejected voter-registration applications of racial minorities were comparable to the accepted applications of whites. This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state's counties in a process that could last months. The Department's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local <b>election</b> <b>officials,</b> who would claim to have misplaced the voter registration records of racial minorities, remove registered racial minorities from the electoral rolls, and resign so that voter registration ceased. Moreover, the Department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal district court judges opposed racial minority suffrage. Thus, between 1957 and 1964, the African-American voter registration rate in the South improved marginally even though the Department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Despite Governor Catts' {{change of}} attitude, white mob action {{frequently}} occurred in towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement. Extrajudicial violence against black residents was so common that it seldom {{was covered by}} newspapers. In 1920, whites removed four black men from jail, who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in Macclenny, and lynched them. In Ocoee the same year, two black citizens armed themselves {{to go to the}} polls during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white <b>election</b> <b>officials</b> were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee's black community, causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre, the Perry Race Riot occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the black community of Perry, Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered. On the day following Wright's lynching, whites shot and hanged two more black men in Perry; next they burned the town's black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families' homes.|$|E

25|$|In November 2016, Ortega {{was elected}} {{for his third}} {{consecutive}} term (his fourth overall). International monitoring of the elections were not prohibited, {{and as a result}} the validity of the elections is disputed. Ortega was reported by Nicaraguan <b>election</b> <b>officials</b> as having received 72% of the vote. However the Broad Front for Democracy (FAD), having promoted boycotts of the elections, claimed that 70% of voters had abstained (while <b>election</b> <b>officials</b> claimed 65.8% participation). Despite growing fears of autocracy and the increasing governmental powers of Ortega's wife Rosario Murillo (m.1979) as his vice president, Ortega is still popular among many Nicaraguans. This is largely {{due to the fact that}} under his presidency, gang violence has diminished, poverty levels have fallen, and Nicaraguan economic growth has surpassed other Latin American countries.|$|E
25|$|Two {{months later}} Karzai {{accepted}} {{calls for a}} second round run-off vote, which was scheduled for 7 November 2009.

25|$|On {{election}} day, the write-in {{ballots were}} counted, but not examined: determining for which candidate they were cast was deferred.

25|$|The {{day before}} the election, Afghan <b>election</b> <b>officials</b> ordered more than 440 polling {{stations}} to stay closed during the vote out of fears of election fraud.

50|$|Apparently {{there was}} a case of an <b>election</b> <b>official</b> misinforming voters of when their vote is {{recorded}} and later recording it himself in municipality elections in Landerd, Netherlands in 2006. A candidate was also an <b>election</b> <b>official</b> and received the unusual amount of 181 votes in the polling place where he was working. In the other three polling places combined he received only 11 votes. Only circumstantial evidence could be found, because the voting machine was a direct-recording electronic voting machine; in a poll by a local newspaper the results were totally different. The case is still under prosecution.|$|R
