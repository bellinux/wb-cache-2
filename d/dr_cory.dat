50|$|Dr. Suzanne Cory {{was raised}} in the Kew suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. She {{attended}} Canterbury Girls' Secondary College, followed by University High School, Melbourne. Her further education includes undergraduate studies at the University of Melbourne and earning a PhD from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge, England. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Cory</b> attended the LMB {{at the same time as}} the Nobel Prize Winners Dr. Francis Crick, known for his co-discovery of the structure of DNA, and Dr. Frederick Sanger, who revolutionised nucleic acid sequencing. While obtaining her PhD, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Cory</b> used Sanger's RNA sequencing techniques to identify the sequence of transfer RNA. Also, during her time at the LMB, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Cory</b> met her current husband, Dr. Jerry Adams, a scientist from the United States. The two scientists later married and had two daughters.|$|E
50|$|Following {{her time}} at the LMB, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Cory</b> {{traveled}} to the University of Geneva for her post-doctoral studies. While in Geneva, she focused on sequencing the RNA of R17 bacteriophage {{for the purpose of}} using it as a model.|$|E

5000|$|After {{a decade}} of {{studying}} the immune system, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Cory's</b> lab switched their focus to cancer and the genetic components of various cancers. Her lab discovered the genetic mutations that lead to Burkitt's lymphoma and Follicular lymphoma. [...] One of the main focuses of their cancer cell research is on cell proliferation and cell death. In particular, the oncoprotein Myc and the Bcl-2 protein family are of interest to her current research lab.|$|R
5000|$|Bcl-2 is an {{important}} family of intracellular proteins that helps regulate apoptosis, or cell suicide. [...] Bcl-2, paired with other regulators, prevents caspases from being activated. [...] The caspases, a type of protease, remain inactive until signaled through a cascade to degrade the proteins {{that make up a}} cell. [...] <b>Dr.</b> <b>Cory's</b> lab has developed Bcl2-blocking agents called BH3 mimetics, which, when paired with low-dose chemotherapy, have had positive results treating specific types of aggressive lymphomas.|$|R

50|$|Unitarian Services in San José {{were first}} held in City Hall in November 1865, with 100 people in attendance. Mr. And Mrs. B.F. Watkins, {{residents}} of Santa Clara {{who belonged to}} the San Francisco Unitarian Church, were staunch supporters of the women's suffrage movement and organizers {{on behalf of the}} U.S. Sanitary Commission, which aided victims of the Civil War (and later became the Red Cross). They had decided that there was a need for a liberal religious presence in San José, and invited the Rev. Charles Gordon Ames to speak. Profoundly affected by his travels through the war-torn South, he devoted his first service to the freedom and dignity of all people, a theme that has echoed throughout the years at the First Unitarian Church, and which, at times, had led the church to take stands that were not popular with more conservative sections of the community. Among the early members of the church were A.T. Herman, a civil engineer who built the road up Mt.

40|$|ArticleCalreticulin (CRT) is an {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) chaperone responsible for glycoprotein folding and Ca 2 + homeostasis. CRT also exerts extracellular functions, e. g., tumor and apoptotic cell recognition and wound healing, but {{the mechanism of}} CRT extracellular release remains unknown. Cytosolic localization of CRT is determined by signal peptide and subsequent retrotranslocation of CRT into the cytoplasm. Here we show that under apoptotic stress conditions, the cytosolic CRT concentration increases and associates with phosphatidylserine (PS) in a Ca 2 + dependent manner. PS distribution is regulated by aminophospholipid translocase (APLT) which maintains PS on the cytosolic side of the cell membrane. APLT is sensitive to redox modifications of its SH-groups by nitrogen species. During apoptosis, both CRT expression and the nitric oxide (NO) concentration increases. By using S-nitroso-L-cysteine-ethyl-ester, an intracellular NO donor and inhibitor of APLT, we showed that PS and CRT externalization occurred together in an S-nitrosothiol (RSNO) dependent and caspase-independent manner. Furthermore, the CRT and PS relocated as punctate clusters on the cell surface. Thus, CRT induced nitrosylation and its externalization with PS may explain how CRT acts as a bridging molecule during apoptotic cell clearance.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The first chapter in this dissertation follows a cohort of initially high performing Missouri students from grade- 3 through grade- 9 and examines which school factors influence their academic success. Three key findings emerge. First, in terms of performance on standardized tests, schools that are effective in promoting academic growth among low performing students are also generally effective with high performing students. Second, high performing students who attend disadvantaged schools are more likely to take Algebra I later relative to their counterparts who attend more advantaged schools. Third, somewhat surprisingly, increasing the number of high performing students in a school negatively affects high performing student outcomes. The second chapter in this dissertation looks at using test measurement error (TME) to improve the precision of value added estimates. I incorporate information about TME directly into VAMs, focusing on TME that derives from the testing instrument itself. In my analysis, I estimate VAMs using Missouri micro data and estimates of TME provided by a major test publisher. I find that inference from VAMs is improved by making simple TME adjustments to the models. This improvement is on the order of what one could expect if teacher-level sample sizes were increased by 11 to 17 percent...|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] This dissertation consists of three essays on the same topic: Children cognitive and non-cognitive development. The first essay compares the performance of Head Start childcare centers to the performance of non-Head Start childcare centers, the latter being the preferred childcare option of wealthier families. We find that, on average, Head Start centers perform similarly to non-Head Start centers. Our results suggest that expectations for the Head Start program may be too high. The second essay examines the agreeability between mothers and caregivers in assessing the non-cognitive development of young children. Using caregiver assessments as a benchmark, we find that minority mothers provide consistently more-favorable evaluations of their children relative to white mothers. Holding race constant, mothers who raise their children in less-favorable family structures also provide more-favorable evaluations. The Third essay compares young children who do and do not enroll in kindergarten due to variation in state-level age-of-entry policies and shows that children who enrolled in kindergarten have much higher achievement in mathematics and reading relative to children who remained in childcare. This study suggests that delaying kindergarten entry meaningfully affects short-term human capital accumulation. The short-term loss is particularly large if children do not have a high-quality alternative to kindergarten, such as a well-designed pre-kindergarten program...|$|E
40|$|The Dean and Betty Gallo Prostate Cancer Center (GPCC) was {{established}} {{with the goal}} of eradicating prostate cancer and improving the lives of men at risk for the disease through research, treatment, education and prevention. GPCC was founded in the memory of Dean Gallo, a beloved New Jersey Congressman who died tragically of prostate cancer diagnosed at an advanced stage. GPCC unites a team of outstanding researchers and clinicians who are committed to high-quality basic research, translation of innovative research to the clinic, exceptional patient care, and improving public education and awareness of prostate cancer. GPCC is a center of excellence of The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, which is the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center in the state. GPCC efforts are now integrated well as part of our Prostate Program at CINJ, in which Dr. Robert DiPaola and <b>Dr.</b> <b>Cory</b> Abate-Shen are co-leaders. The Prostate Program unites 19 investigators from 10 academic departments who have broad and complementary expertise in prostate cancer research. The overall goal and unifying theme is to elucidate basic mechanisms of prostate growth and oncogenesis, with the ultimate goal of promoting new and effective strategies for the eradication of prostate cancer. Members' wide range of research interests collectively optimize the chances of providing new insights into normal prostate biology and unraveling the molecular pathophysiology of prostate cancer. Cell culture and powerful animal models developed by program members recapitulate the various stages of prostate cancer progression, including prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma, androgen-independence, invasion and metastases. These models promise to further strengthen an already robust program of investigator-initiated therapeutic clinical trials, including studies adopted by national cooperative groups. Efforts to translate laboratory results into clinical studies of early detection and chemoprevention are underway. The specific goals of this program are: (1) To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying normal prostate growth and differentiation and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying prostate oncogenesis. (2) To build on fundamental knowledge to develop effective therapeutic approaches for the treatment of prostate cancer. (3) To improve the control of prostate cancer through early detection, chemoprevention, and outreach and education. This new disease-based program is structured to improve interdisciplinary interactions and translational results. Already, through the dynamic leadership of Drs. Cory Abate-Shen and Robert DiPaola, new investigators were attracted to the field, new collaborations engendered, and numerous investigator-initiated trials implemented. Progress in GPCC and the program overall has been outstanding. The Center has success in uniting investigators with broad and complementary expertise in prostate cancer research.
