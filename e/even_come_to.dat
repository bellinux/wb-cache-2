In his less favorable review for Esquire, Stephen Garrett criticized the film for failing to show Guevara's negative aspects, [...] "the absence of darker, more contradictory revelations of his nature leaves Che bereft of complexity. All that remains is a South American superman: uncomplex, pure of heart, defiantly pious and boring". Richard Corliss had problems with Del Toro's portrayal of Guevara: [...] "Del Toro—whose acting style often starts {{over the top and}} soars from there, like a hang-glider leaping from a skyscraper roof—is muted, yielding few emotional revelations, seemingly sedated here ... Che is defined less by his rigorous fighting skills and seductive intellect than by his asthma". In his review for Salon.com, Andrew O'Hehir praised Soderbergh for making [...] "something that people will be eager to see and eager to talk about all over the world, something that feels strangely urgent, something messy and unfinished and amazing. I'd be surprised if Che doesn't win the Palme d'Or ... but be that as it may, nobody who saw it here will ever forget it".|$|E

[...] Tebow led the Gators in rushing in 2007 but also had to play through a bruised shoulder and broken non-throwing hand. Before the 2008 season even started, Tebow had his name pulled from consideration for the Playboy Preseason All-American team because it conflicted with his Christian beliefs.|$|E
2500|$|They characterised {{the older}} name (which implied [...] "a {{separate}} {{ethnic and religious}} identity") as an [...] "invention of the sect's enemies", ostensibly favouring an emphasis on [...] "connection with mainstream Islam"—particularly the Shia branch. As such, [...] "Nusayri" [...] is now generally regarded as antiquated, and has <b>even</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> have insulting and abusive connotations. The term is frequently employed as hate speech by Sunni fundamentalists fighting against Bashar al-Assad's government in the Syrian civil war, who use its emphasis on Ibn Nusayr in order to insinuate that Alawi beliefs are [...] "man-made" [...] and not divinely inspired.|$|E

She declared, [...] "Ronald Reagan honored the role of full-time homemaker and her rights in Social Security and income tax in the face of elite feminists' demeaning of full-time mothers." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{approximately}} {{three years on}} the throne at Jerusalem, Baldwin was faced with his very first military challenge. Saladin invaded the Christian kingdom in approximately 1177 to rout the Crusaders. Although Saladin was almost twenty years older and more experienced than Baldwin, the youthful Christian monarch did not flounder in stressful situations. Baldwin and his Crusaders outwitted the Muslims at Mont Gisard on 25 November 1177. As one Crusade scholar wrote with regards to Montgisard, [...] "his was a striking achievement – the only defeat in pitched battle that Saladin suffered {{before the advent of}} Richard the Lionheart and the Third Crusade". By the end of the battle, Saladin was forced to flee back to Egypt after narrowly escaping death. Although the victory resulted in tremendous losses for Baldwin’s armies, his image throughout the kingdom gained in strength. In fact, some Christians in the Near East had <b>even</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> believe that 'miracle' of his victory [...] appear as a sign of divine mandate".|$|E
2500|$|The {{decisions}} were controversial and have prompted Congress {{to consider the}} only remaining legal avenue to enact flag protection statutes—a constitutional amendment. Each Congress since the Johnson decision has considered creating a flag desecration amendment. From 1995 to 2005, beginning with the 104th Congress, the proposed amendment was approved biennially by the two-thirds majority necessary in the U.S. House of Representatives, but it consistently failed {{to achieve the same}} constitutionally-required super-majority vote in the U.S. Senate. [...] During some sessions, the proposed amendment did not <b>even</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a vote in the Senate before the expiration of the Congress' term. [...] The last time it was considered, in the 109th Congress, the Amendment failed by one vote in the Senate. Some Senate Republican aides indicated that almost a dozen of the Republican senators who voted for the amendment were privately opposed to it, and they believed that these senators would have voted to defeat the amendment if required.|$|E
