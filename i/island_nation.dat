5|$|With {{effect from}} June 12, {{a state of}} public {{emergency}} was declared {{for the whole of}} Tuvalu, by the then Governor-General of Tuvalu, Sir Tulaga Manuella.

5|$|In {{the days}} prior to hitting Dominica, David was {{originally}} expected to hit Barbados and spare Dominica in the process. However, on August 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the 150 mph (240 km/h) hurricane to make a direct hit on {{the southern part of}} Dominica. Even as it became increasingly clear that David was headed for the island, residents did not appear to take the situation seriously. This can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent. Furthermore, Dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population. This proved to have disastrous consequences for the <b>island</b> <b>nation.</b>|$|E
