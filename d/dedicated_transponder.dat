25|$|A {{launched}} on February 1, 1984, initially available to 9.3 million cable television {{homes in the}} U.S. and Canada. The network {{is a result of}} the 1984 merger of Hearst/ABC's Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS) and (pre–General Electric merger) RCA-owned The Entertainment Channel. When A debuted, the channel took over the satellite transponder timeslot that ARTS occupied from its launch in 1981. Children's television channel Nickelodeon signed off just before 9:00p.m. Eastern Time, and A took over at 9:00p.m. with a three-hour programming block, which was repeated at 9:00p.m. Pacific Time. In January 1985, A moved to its own <b>dedicated</b> <b>transponder</b> and began delivering its programming 24 hours a day, while Nickelodeon replaced the vacated A programming with a classic television block, Nick at Nite, on July 1 of that year. However, some cable providers continued to carry Nickelodeon and A on the same channel and would usually switch over to A at 8:00p.m. Eastern. It was not until the early 1990s, when providers began installing advanced headend equipment that allowed for expanded channel capacity, that these companies allocated separate channels for both networks.|$|E

50|$|One {{of the new}} broadcaster’s first actions was {{the release}} of a {{discussion}} paper in 1981 setting out its long-term vision and goals in a discussion paper. Both the Department of Communications and the CRTC were seeking appropriate responses to the recommendations of the Therrien Report. IBC provided them with a number of recommendations, including:• A funding program for all Inuit broadcasters (IBC, Taqramiut Nipingat in northern Quebec, the newly formed OkalaKatiget Society in Labrador);• Recognition of Aboriginal broadcasters in the Broadcast Act;• A special CRTC policy acknowledging and supporting Aboriginal broadcasters;• The creation of a <b>dedicated</b> northern <b>transponder</b> (a satellite channel committed exclusively to northern programming).|$|R

50|$|That summer, A&E {{announced}} that it would move the network to its own <b>dedicated</b> <b>transponder</b> and become a separate 24-hour cable channel to take better advantage of valuable satellite time. The move took place on January 1, 1985, with Nickelodeon expanding part of its programming schedule to fill the time period formerly held by A&E with more teen-oriented programming and displaying a test pattern screen after the network signed off later in the evening.|$|E

50|$|On April 27, 1986, the Okeechobee {{toll plaza}} {{opened with a}} $.25 toll, with the toll plaza at the US 27 exit being removed, and tolls at the Miramar plaza being lowered from $.40 to $.25. On February 2, 1989, tolls on the Expressway doubled from $1.00 to $2.00, with $.50 being charged at each toll plaza. Toll hikes, raising the cost of {{travelling}} the expressway from $2 to $3 were supposed to take effect on the Homestead Extension in 1993 to match {{the rest of the}} Turnpike, but Hurricane Andrew's impact in the area in 1992 had the state delay toll hikes on the highway until July 9, 1995. In 1997, the Bird Road toll plaza was reconfigured to its current two part form to accommodate the then-bottleneck section of the expressway. The SunPass electronic toll collection system was implemented during 1999, with the toll plazas being reconfigured to allow lanes <b>dedicated</b> to <b>transponder</b> users. A toll hike took effect on March 7, 2004, increasing the toll rate for non SunPass users to $4 for a full length trip, with SunPass users still using the 1995 toll rates.|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} recognition among travelers, transportation professionals, and decision {{makers of the}} importance of the reliability of transportation facilities. An important step towards improving system reliability is developing methods that can be used in practice to predict freeway travel times for the near future (e. g. 5 – 15 minutes). Reliable and accurate predictions of future travel times can be used by travelers to make better decisions and by system operators to engage in pre-active rather than reactive system management. Recent advances in wireless communications and the proliferation of personal devices that communicate wirelessly using the Bluetooth protocol have resulted in the development of a Bluetooth traffic monitoring system. This system is becoming increasingly popular for collecting vehicle travel time data in real-time, mainly because it has the following advantages over other technologies: (1) measuring travel time directly; (2) anonymous detection; (3) weatherproof; and (4) cost-effectiveness. The data collected from Bluetooth detectors are similar to data collected from Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) systems using <b>dedicated</b> <b>transponders</b> (e. g. such as electronic toll tags), and therefore using these data for travel time prediction faces some of the same challenges as using AVI measurements, namely: (1) determining the optimal spacing between detectors; (2) dynamic outlier detection and travel time estimation must be able to respond quickly to rapid travel time changes; and (3) a time lag exists between the time when vehicles enter the segment and the time that their travel time can be measured (i. e. when the vehicle exits the monitored segment). In this thesis, a generalized model was proposed to determine the optimal average spacing of Bluetooth detector deployments on urban freeways as a function of the length of the route for which travel times are to be estimated; a traffic flow filtering model was proposed to be applied as an enhancement to existing data-driven outlier detection algorithms as a mechanism to improve outlier detection performance; a short-term prediction model combining outlier filtering algorithm with Kalman filter was proposed for predicting near future freeway travel times using Bluetooth data with special attention to the time lag problem. The results of this thesis indicate that the optimal detector spacing ranges from 2 km for routes of 4 km in length to 5 km for routes of 20 km in length; the proposed filtering model is able to solve the problem of tracking sudden changes in travel times and enhance the performance of the data-driven outlier detection algorithms; the proposed short-term prediction model significantly improves the accuracy of travel time prediction for 5, 10 and 15 minutes prediction horizon under both free flow and non-free flow traffic states. The mean absolute relative errors (MARE) are improved by 8. 8 % to 30. 6 % under free flow traffic conditions, and 7. 5 % to 49. 9 % under non-free flow traffic conditions. The 90 th percentile errors and standard deviation of the prediction errors are also improved...|$|R

40|$|A sensing {{network is}} described, {{consisting}} of a multiplexing reader and one or more sensor pairs, each sensor pair comprising a <b>transponder</b> and a <b>dedicated</b> reader, <b>dedicated</b> to that <b>transponder,</b> each transponder having a sensor. Each sensor pair is able to wirelessly interface and power both capacitive and resistive sensors at a short distance with high efficiency. By providing a dedicated reader for each transponder, each link can be optimized {{and there is no}} need for the dedicated reader to distinguish between signals from other transponders. The transponder generates an analog signal directly using a sensor or analog memory value and sends it by modulation to the dedicated reader. So, the dedicated readers do not need to have circuitry to demodulate a digital signal or ID code. The transponder includes the sensors and their electronic circuits and can be optionally remotely powered by the dedicated reader through the wireless link. The expected consumption of the dedicated reader can be lower than 200 μW...|$|R
40|$|Sentinel- 3 A, {{launched}} in February 2016, {{is part of}} ESA's long-term commitment to climate monitoring from space. Its suite of instruments for measuring surface topography includes a Microwave Radiometer (MWR) and SRAL, the first delay-Doppler instrument to provide global coverage. SRAL promises fine spatial resolution and reduced noise levels that should together lead to improved performance over all Earth surfaces. The Sentinel- 3 Mission Performance Centre (S 3 MPC) has been developing the methodology to evaluate the accuracy of retrievals, monitor any changes and develop solutions to known problems. The S 3 MPC monitors internal temperatures, path delays and {{the shape of the}} generated pulses to assess the instruments health. The MWR records over known reference surfaces are compared with those from other spaceborne instruments. Over the ocean the SRAL's return pulses are analysed to give range to the sea surface, wave height and signal strength (which can be interpreted as wind speed). The metocean data are regularly contrasted with records from in situ measurements and the output from meteorological models, which rapidly highlights the effects of any changes in processing. Range information is used to give surface elevation, which is assessed in three ways. First, flights over a <b>dedicated</b> radar <b>transponder</b> provide an estimate of path delay to within 10 mm (r. m. s.). Second, measurements are compared to GPS- levelled surfaces near Corsica and over Lake Issyk-kul. Third, there are consistency checks between ascending and descending passes and with other missions. Further waveform analysis techniques are being developed to improve the retrieval of information over sea-ice, land-ice and inland waters...|$|R
