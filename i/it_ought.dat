5|$|In 1895, he {{published}} The Rules of Sociological Method, a manifesto stating what sociology {{is and how}} <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> to be done, and founded the first European department {{of sociology at the}} University of Bordeaux. In 1898, he founded L'Année Sociologique, the first French social science journal. Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, {{he published}} Suicide, a case study that provided an example of what the sociological monograph might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of quantitative methods in criminology during his suicide case study.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of war, gout began to cause Battenberg considerable pain, and the naval staff he had set up did not function as well as <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> to have done. On 6 August 1914 Battenberg and the French Deputy Chief of Staff of the Navy Antoine Schwerer signed a convention in London on the division of responsibilities between the two navies. The convention confirmed {{the terms of the}} Entente Cordiale, and placed France in command of all naval operations in the Mediterranean. Malta and Gibraltar would both be treated as French naval bases. In the event that Austria entered the war France would act against its naval forces, and would at minimum prevent them passing the Strait of Otranto.|$|E
25|$|A primary {{motivation}} for paraconsistent logic is {{the conviction that}} <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> to be possible to reason with inconsistent information in a controlled and discriminating way. The principle of explosion precludes this, and so must be abandoned. In non-paraconsistent logics, {{there is only one}} inconsistent theory: the trivial theory that has every sentence as a theorem. Paraconsistent logic makes it possible to distinguish between inconsistent theories and to reason with them.|$|E
60|$|What is {{the meaning}} of <b>it</b> all? <b>Ought</b> <b>it</b> to be so, or <b>ought</b> <b>it</b> not? Is it God's will and law, or is it not? That is a solemn question; and one which has tried many a thoughtful, and tender, and virtuous soul ere now, both Christian and heathen; and has driven them to find strange answers to it, which have been, often enough, not {{according}} to Scripture, or to the Catholic Faith.|$|R

25|$|Although the molad of Tishrei is {{the only}} molad moment that is not ritually announced, it is {{actually}} {{the only one that}} is relevant to the Hebrew calendar, for it determines the provisional date of Rosh Hashanah, subject to the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules. The other monthly molad moments are announced for mystical reasons. With the moladot on average almost 100 minutes late, this means that the molad of Tishrei lands one day later than <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> to in (100 minutes) ÷ (1440 minutes per day) = 5 of 72 years or nearly 7% of years.|$|E
25|$|It is usual to {{say that}} Mill is {{committing}} a number of fallacies. He is accused of committing the naturalistic fallacy, because {{he is trying to}} deduce what people ought to do from what they in fact do; the fallacy of equivocation, because he moves from the fact that (1) something is desirable, i.e. is capable of being desired, to the claim that (2) it is desirable, i.e. that <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> to be desired; and the fallacy of composition, because the fact that people desire their own happiness does not imply that the aggregate of all persons will desire the general happiness.|$|E
25|$|During the {{earliest}} parts of psychoanalytic history, analysts granted that homosexuality was non-pathological in certain cases, and the ethical {{question of whether}} <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> to be changed was discussed. By the 1920s analysts assumed that homosexuality was pathological and that attempts to treat it were appropriate, although psychoanalytic opinion about changing homosexuality was largely pessimistic. Those forms of homosexuality that were considered perversions were usually held to be uncurable. Analysts' tolerant statements about homosexuality arose from recognition {{of the difficulty of}} achieving change. Beginning in the 1930s and continuing for roughly twenty years, major changes occurred in how analysts viewed homosexuality, which involved a shift in the rhetoric of analysts, some of whom felt free to ridicule and abuse their gay patients.|$|E

25|$|With the {{southern}} moorland, {{the coast and}} the river, Tees-side has a splendid setting and <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> to be made worthy of its 400,000 inhabitants. This task requires a comprehensive plan for the whole area designed to secure the benefit of its port, its industries and its commerce, the reclamation of its marshlands, the building of new roads and bridges, the renewal of obsolete parts of the old riverside development, the designing of new centres {{and the provision of}} new amenities. This formidable task gives scope not for ten authorities to develop or redevelop ten towns but for a single authority to work out the details of the probable future growth and needs of Tees-side, and then prepare and carry out a single plan for the whole area.|$|E
25|$|Grattan {{supported}} the veto, {{but a more}} radical Catholic party was now arising in Ireland {{under the leadership of}} Daniel O'Connell, and Grattan's influence gradually declined. He seldom spoke in Parliament after 1810, the most notable exception being in 1815, when he separated himself from the Whigs and {{supported the}} final struggle against Napoléon. His last speech of all, in 1819, contained a passage referring to the Union he had so passionately resisted, which exhibits the statesmanship, {{and at the same time}} the equable quality, of Grattan's character. His sentiments with regard to the policy of the Union remained, he said, unchanged; but the marriage, having taken place, it is now the duty, as <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> to be the inclination, of every individual to render it as fruitful, as profitable and as advantageous as possible.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>ought</b> to be remembered, as {{a comment}} on the {{unfavourable}} description by Jean de La Bruyère, that La Fontaine was a special friend and ally of Benserade, La Bruyere's chief literary enemy. But after all deductions much will remain, especially when it is remembered {{that one of the}} chief authorities for these anecdotes is Louis Racine, a man who possessed intelligence and moral worth, and who received them from his father, La Fontaine's attached friend for more than thirty years. Perhaps the best worth recording of all these stories is one of the Vieux Colombier quartet, which tells how Molière, while Racine and Boileau were exercising their wits upon le bonhomme or le bon (by both which titles La Fontaine was familiarly known), remarked to a bystander, Nos beaux esprits ont beau faire, ils n'effaceront pas le bonhomme. They have not.|$|E

25|$|Yang Jwing-Ming (who {{is not a}} {{practitioner}} of the art) argues that aspects of Xing Yi Quan (particularly the animal styles) are identifiable {{as far back as}} the Liang Dynasty at the Shaolin Temple. According to Jwing-Ming, Yue Fei therefore did not strictly invent Xing Yi Quan, but synthesized and perfected existing Shaolin principles into his own style of gongfu which he popularized during his military service. Nonetheless, according to Jwing-Ming, Yue Fei is usually identified as the creator because of his considerable understanding of the art (as shown in the work The Ten Theses of Xingyiquan, credited to Yue) and his cultural status as a Chinese war hero. <b>It</b> <b>ought</b> be noted that in Chinese culture, it is common to attribute the creation of great traditions to legendary individuals. In such a way, the art of Tai Ji Quan is attributed to the legendary Zhang Sanfeng, and Daoism to Laozi, even though as in the case with Yue Fei, there exists no proof for such claim.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the Financial Services Authority had a {{moratorium}} on short selling 29 leading financial stocks, effective from 2300 GMT, 19 September 2008 until 16 January 2009. After the ban was lifted, John McFall, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, House of Commons, made clear in public statements and {{a letter to the}} FSA that he believed <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> to be extended. Between 19 and 21 September 2008, Australia temporarily banned short selling, and later placed an indefinite ban on naked short selling. Australia's ban on short selling was further extended for another 28 days on 21 October 2008. Also during September 2008, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and Canada banned short selling leading financial stocks, and France, the Netherlands and Belgium banned naked short selling leading financial stocks. By contrast with the approach taken by other countries, Chinese regulators responded by allowing short selling, along with a package of other market reforms.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{from the}} Sun should have {{converted}} {{all traces of}} methane in Titan's atmosphere into more complex hydrocarbons within 50 million years — a short time compared {{to the age of}} the Solar System. This suggests that methane must be somehow replenished by a reservoir on or within Titan itself. That Titan's atmosphere contains over a thousand times more methane than carbon monoxide would appear to rule out significant contributions from cometary impacts, because comets are composed of more carbon monoxide than methane. That Titan might have accreted an atmosphere from the early Saturnian nebula at the time of formation also seems unlikely; in such a case, <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> to have atmospheric abundances similar to the solar nebula, including hydrogen and neon. Many astronomers have suggested that the ultimate origin for the methane in Titan's atmosphere is from within Titan itself, released via eruptions from cryovolcanoes. A possible biological origin for the methane has not been discounted (see Life on Titan).|$|E

25|$|On November 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 181, the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine; it {{contained}} a recommendation that Jerusalem be placed under a special international regime, a corpus separatum, {{administered by the}} United Nations and be separate from both the Jewish and Arab states envisioned. Following the conflict that ensued, cease-fires and the 1949 Armistice Agreements were negotiated and accepted by both sides. One of these resulted, in part, in a temporary division of Jerusalem. The relevant Armistice Agreement with Jordan was signed on April 3, 1949, but it was considered internationally as having no legal effect on the continued validity of {{the provisions of the}} partition resolution for the internationalization of Jerusalem. On April 25, 1949, King Abdullah officially changed the name of Transjordan to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. He had secured the support of Great Britain (albeit qualified—Great Britain did not recognize the incorporation of East Jerusalem, maintaining that <b>it</b> <b>ought</b> {{to be part of a}} corpus separatum, an international enclave).|$|E
