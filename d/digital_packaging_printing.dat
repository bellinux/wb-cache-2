40|$|Packaging is {{currently}} the centre of intensive research that is being carried out regarding new technologies that integrate digital data on a package. This has been fuelled by developments in electronics technology, materials and processes that {{have the potential to}} create packages that can carry digital- machine readable data. These developments concern in particular, new materials (such as printed polymers) and tagging applications (such as RFID and EAS systems) which are described as “intelligent”, “smart ” or “active ” packaging. One matter of particular interest is how these types of digital information can be integrated and implemented into the existing production workflow of packaging, which is normally consisted by the processes of <b>packaging</b> design, prepress, <b>printing</b> and finishing. Therefore, the objective of the study is to examine the various factors and parameters that might affect the production management and workflow of the traditional/existing packaging design and production. The paper is based mainly on a literature study on smart packaging applications and their developments as well as on findings from leading research institutes, manufacturers and academia, as it regards new technology applications for <b>packaging</b> <b>printing</b> production. A final outcome from the present survey is that <b>packaging</b> <b>printing</b> production management is expected to be subjected in changes (investments, production workflow, integration of new/additional processes, quality controls etc).

40|$|Most of {{the elderly}} have {{difficulties}} with computer technology. They lack computer literacy, {{and at the same}} time, have physiological changes that are associated with impaired perception, cognition, and other social aspects. These limitations can be lessened using multimedia elements to assist in their interaction with computers. One of these multimedia elements is 3 D animation. We have incorporated 3 D animation into a <b>digital</b> educational nutritional <b>package,</b> which was designed following the design guidelines for older adults, for better interface user interaction. An experiment was carried out to measure user acceptance; and a comparison was made between the <b>digital</b> <b>package</b> and a booklet. Questionnaires were distributed to six elderly subjects, aged 60 to 75 years old. Overall, the results showed that the 3 D animation was helpful in facilitating an understanding of the content. The comparison experiment involved ten respondents that were divided into the experiment (<b>digital</b> <b>package)</b> and control (booklet) groups. Each group was given a task and the completion time for each was recorded. The findings indicate that the content exploration using the <b>digital</b> <b>package</b> was faster than using the traditional booklet. Of the respondents, 60 % from the experiment group were able to access the content in less than two minutes; compared to 40 % from the control group. These initial findings indicate the possibility of using a <b>digital</b> education <b>package,</b> and as such, should be explored further with larger samples and modules, in order to increase the nutritional and health knowledge and awareness among the elderly...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper has}} {{investigated}} influence of various technologies on recycling of vegetal raw material {{with the purpose}} to obtain the desired product used for <b>package</b> <b>printing.</b> Influence of various technological regimes and introduction of fresh polyethylene additives for recycled raw material on qualitative indices of the desired product has been studied in the paper. Investigations of preliminary aquatic hydrolysis of vegetal raw material have shown {{that in order to}} obtain high quality cellulose from vegetal raw material it is necessary that this cellulose has not less than 2 - 3 % of hemicellulose otherwise its qualitative indices are significantly deteriorated that is important for <b>packaging</b> <b>printing.</b> Usage of carbon dioxide aqueous solution for preliminary vegetal raw material hydrolysis contributes to reduction in destruction of cellulose carbo-hydrate. This improves qualitative indices of the obtained desired product that is cellulose which is used for <b>package</b> <b>printing.</b> Recommendations for sulphate pulping of vegetal raw material with preliminary hydrolysis have been prepared with the purpose to improve physical and mechanical characteristics of the obtained desired product - cellulose {{on the basis of the}} obtained data on content of hemicellulose in cellulose. While investigating recycled polymers the obtained results have demonstrated that increase of low- molecular product content in them looks rather typical. This suggests that packaging will have lower qualitative indices while using polymers being kept in waste deposits. In order to avoid this phenomena it is necessary to add 20 - 30 % of fresh polymers during their recycling. </p...|$|R
