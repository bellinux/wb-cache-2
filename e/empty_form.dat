2500|$|As the {{new school}} year starts in September, Roy Straitley {{is looking forward to}} his 100th term at St Oswald's, where he has been {{teaching}} for 33 years. Having never married, he lives alone and has devoted his life to his career. His sitting room walls are full of pictures of [...] "his boys", and St Oswald's represents his only family. He is slightly overweight and ugly by conventional standards (his nickname among his pupils is [...] "Quaz", short for [...] "Quasimodo"). Popular with the students, he adheres to the old principle of being [...] "firm but fair" [...] where teaching and disciplinary matters are concerned. An incurable optimist, Straitley is only uncomfortable when he has to deal with the opposite sex. He is a keen observer, and hardly anything connected with life at the school, however insignificant, ever escapes his notice. A firm believer in the advantages and importance of a classical education, he shuns computers, resorts to Latin to swear and insult his colleagues (which they do not understand), and opposes the idea of any competition between schools other than the kind which is carried out on the playing fields. Smoking Gauloises in his <b>empty</b> <b>form</b> room is his [...] "one concession to the influence of the Modern Languages", and there is long-standing enmity between Straitley and Dr Devine, the Head of German.|$|E

6000|$|Whether or no the Annexation was a {{necessity}} {{at the moment}} of its execution,--which I certainly maintain it was--it received the unreserved sanction of the Home Authorities, and the relations of Sovereign and subject, with all the many and mutual obligations involved in that connection, were established between the Queen of England and every individual of the motley population of the Transvaal. Nor was this change an <b>empty</b> <b>form,</b> for, to the largest proportion of that population, this transfer of allegiance brought with it a priceless and a vital boon.

60|$|It is {{something}} so new to Pleasant {{to see her}} father an object of sympathy and interest, to find any one very willing to tolerate his society in this world, not to say pressingly and soothingly entreating him to belong to it, that it gives her a sensation she never experienced before. Some hazy idea that if affairs could remain thus {{for a long time}} it would be a respectable change, floats in her mind. Also some vague idea that the old evil is drowned out of him, and that if he should happily come back to resume his occupation of the <b>empty</b> <b>form</b> that lies upon the bed, his spirit will be altered.

In the days of Rubens, you must remember, mythology was thought of as a mere <b>empty</b> <b>form</b> of compliment or fable, and the original meaning of it wholly forgotten. Rubens never dreamed that Argus is the night, or that his eyes are stars; but with the absolutely literal and brutal part of his Dutch nature supposes the head of Argus full of real eyes all over, and represents Hebe cutting them out with a bloody knife and putting one into the hand of the goddess, like an unseemly oyster.|$|E
60|$|Owing to unpopularity, the Bolsheviks {{have had}} to rely upon {{the army and the}} Extraordinary Commission, and have been {{compelled}} to reduce the Soviet system to an <b>empty</b> <b>form.</b> More and more the pretence of representing the proletariat has grown threadbare. Amid official demonstrations and processions and meetings the genuine proletarian looks on, apathetic and disillusioned, unless he is possessed of unusual energy and fire, in which case he looks to the ideas of syndicalism or the I.W.W. to liberate him from a slavery far more complete than that of capitalism. A sweated wage, long hours, industrial conscription, prohibition of strikes, prison for slackers, diminution of the already insufficient rations in factories where the production falls below what the authorities expect, an army of spies ready to report any tendency to political disaffection and to procure imprisonment for its promoters--this is the reality of a system which still professes to govern {{in the name of the}} proletariat.|$|E
60|$|In Scotland the custom, now disused in England, of {{inviting}} {{the relations of}} the deceased to the interment is universally retained. On many occasions this has a singular and striking effect, but it degenerates into mere <b>empty</b> <b>form</b> and grimace {{in cases where the}} defunct has had the misfortune to live unbeloved and die unlamented. The English service for the dead, {{one of the most beautiful}} and impressive parts of the ritual of the church, would have in such cases the effect of fixing the attention, and uniting the thoughts and feelings of the audience present in an exercise of devotion so peculiarly adapted to such an occasion. But according to the Scottish custom, if there be not real feeling among the assistants, there is nothing to supply the deficiency, and exalt or rouse the attention; so that a sense of tedious form, and almost hypocritical restraint, is too apt to pervade the company assembled for the mournful solemnity. Mrs. Margaret Bertram was unluckily one of those whose good qualities had attached no general friendship. She had no near relations who might have mourned from natural affection, and therefore her funeral exhibited merely the exterior trappings of sorrow.|$|E

60|$|Even {{where men}} were not sacrificed to the gods, the tourist among the temples would learn that these bloody rites {{had once been}} customary, and ceremonies existed by way of commutation. This is {{precisely}} what we find in Vedic religion, in which the <b>empty</b> <b>form</b> of sacrificing a man was gone through, and {{the origin of the}} world was traced to the fragments of a god sacrificed by gods.(1) In Sparta was an altar of Artemis Orthia, and a wooden image of great rudeness and antiquity--so rude indeed, that Pausanias, though accustomed to Greek fetish-stones, thought it must be of barbaric origin. The story was that certain people of different towns, when sacrificing at the altar, were seized with frenzy and slew each other. The oracle commanded that the altar should be sprinkled with human blood. Men were therefore chosen by lot to be sacrificed till Lycurgus commuted the offering, and sprinkled the altar with the blood of boys who were flogged before the goddess. The priestess holds the statue of the goddess during the flogging, and if any of the boys are but lightly scourged, the image becomes too heavy for her to bear.|$|E
6000|$|There is {{a dreadful}} schism in the British nation. Since {{we are not}} able to reunite the empire, it is our {{business}} to give all possible vigor and soundness to those parts of it which are still content to be governed by our councils. Sir, it is proper to inform you that our measures must be healing. Such a degree of strength must be communicated to {{all the members of the}} state as may enable them to defend themselves, and to coöperate in the defence of the whole. Their temper, too, must be managed, and their good affections cultivated. They may then be disposed to bear the load with cheerfulness, as a contribution towards what may be called with truth and propriety, and not by an <b>empty</b> <b>form</b> of words, a common cause. Too little dependence cannot be had, at this time of day, on names and prejudices. The eyes of mankind are opened, and communities must be held together by an evident and solid interest. God forbid that our conduct should demonstrate to the world that Great Britain can in no instance whatsoever be brought to a sense of rational and equitable policy but by coercion and force of arms! ...|$|E
6000|$|Again: There {{is a third}} reason {{which makes}} one suspect that people do not mean {{what they say about}} this matter. I think too many say, [...] "It has pleased God," [...] merely as an <b>empty</b> <b>form</b> of words, when all they mean is, [...] "What must be, must, and it cannot be helped." [...] Else, why do they say, [...] "It has pleased the Lord to send me sickness?" [...] What is the use of saying, [...] "It has pleased the Lord to cure me," [...] when you say in the same breath, [...] "It has pleased the Lord to make me ill?" [...] I know you will say that, [...] "Of course, {{whatever}} happens must be the Lord's will; if it did not please Him it would not happen." [...] I do not care for such words; I will {{have nothing to do with}} them. I will neither entangle you nor myself in those endless disputings and questions about freewill and necessity, which never yet have come to any conclusion, and never will, because they are too deep for poor short- sighted human beings like us. [...] "To the law and to the testimony," [...] say I. I will hold to the words of the Bible; what it says, I will say; what it does not say I will not say, to please any man's system of doctrines. And I say from the Bible that we have no more right to say, [...] "It has pleased the Lord to make me sick," [...] than, [...] "It has pleased the Lord to make me a sinner." [...] Scripture everywhere speaks of sickness as a real evil and a curse--a breaking of the health, and order, and strength, and harmony of God's creation. It speaks of madmen as possessed with evil spirits; did THAT please God? The woman who was bowed with a spirit of infirmity, and could not lift herself up--did our Lord say that it had pleased God to make her a wretched cripple? No; he spoke of her as this daughter of Israel, whom Satan had bound, and not God, this eighteen years; and that was His reason for healing her, even on the sabbath-day, because her disease was not the work of God, but of the cruel, disordering, destroying evil spirit which is at enmity with God. That was why Christ cured her. And THAT--for this is the point I have been coming to, step by step--that was the reason why, when John the Baptist sent to ask if Jesus was the Christ, our Lord answered: [...] "Go and show John again those things which ye do see and hear: the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them." ...|$|E
60|$|The Pilgrims' Suppers: where lords {{and ladies}} {{waited on the}} Pilgrims, in token of humility, and dried their feet when they had been well washed by deputy: were very attractive.

60|$|A fourth fact, {{akin to the}} foregoing, is, {{that these}} several kinds of {{government}} not only decline together, but corrupt together. By the same process that a Court of Chancery becomes a place not for the administration of justice, but for the withholding of it--by the same process that a national church, from being an agency for moral control, comes to be merely a thing of formulas and tithes and bishoprics--by this same process do titles and ceremonies that once had a meaning and a power become <b>empty</b> <b>forms.</b>|$|R
6000|$|To gratify thy long desire, (So {{love and}} piety require,) From Bindon's colours you may trace The patriot's venerable face.

[...] Such one, my Nugent, was thy Swift, Endued with each exalted gift, But lo! the pure ethereal flame Is darken'd by a misty steam: The balm exhausted breathes no smell, The rose is wither'd ere it fell. That godlike supplement of law, Which held the wicked world in awe And could the tide of faction stem, Is but a shell without the gem. [...] Ye sons of genius, who would aim To build an everlasting fame, And in the field of letter'd arts, Display the trophies of your parts, To yonder mansion turn aside, And mortify your growing pride. Behold the brightest of the race, And Nature's honour, in disgrace: With humble resignation own, That all your talents are a loan; By Providence advanced for use, Which you should study to produce Reflect, the mental stock, alas! However current now it pass, May haply be recall'd from you Before the grave demands his due, Then, while your morning star proceeds, Direct your course to worthy deeds, In fuller day discharge your debts; For, when your sun of reason sets, The night succeeds; and all your schemes Of glory vanish with your dreams. [...] Ah! where is now the supple train, That danced attendance on the Dean? Say, where are those facetious folks, Who shook with laughter at his jokes, And with attentive rapture hung, On wisdom, dropping from his tongue; Who look'd with high disdainful pride On all the busy world beside, And rated his productions more Than treasures of Peruvian ore? [...] Good Christians! they with bended knees Ingulf'd the wine, but loathe the lees, Averting, (so the text commands,) With ardent eyes and upcast hands, The cup of sorrow from their lips, And fly, like rats, from sinking ships. While some, who by his friendship rose To wealth, in concert with his foes Run counter to their former track, Like old Actæon's horrid pack Of yelling mongrels, in requitals To riot on their master's vitals; And, where they cannot blast his laurels, Attempt to stigmatize his morals; Through Scandal's magnifying glass His foibles view, but virtues pass, And on the ruins of his fame Erect an ignominious name. So vermin foul, of vile extraction, The spawn of dirt and putrefaction, The sounder members traverse o'er, But fix and fatten on a sore. Hence! peace, ye wretches, who revile His wit, his humour, and his style; Since all the monsters which he drew Were only meant to copy you; And, if the colours be not fainter, Arraign yourselves, and not the painter. [...] But, O! that He, who gave him breath, Dread arbiter of life and death: That He, the moving soul of all, The sleeping spirit would recall, And crown him with triumphant meeds, For all his past heroic deeds, In mansions of unbroken rest, The bright republic of the bless'd! Irradiate his benighted mind With living light of light refined; And there the blank of thought employ With objects of immortal joy! [...] Yet, while he drags the sad remains Of life, slow-creeping through his veins, Above the views of private ends, The tributary Muse attends, To prop his feeble steps, or shed The pious tear around his bed. [...] So pilgrims, with devout complaints, Frequent the graves of martyr'd saints, Inscribe their worth in artless lines, And, in their stead, embrace their shrines.|$|E

Its large open spaces, eerily <b>empty,</b> <b>form</b> the strongest contrast to the densely packed jostle of grotesquely caricatured and exotically garbed figures of the foreground mob. The theme of Ecce Homo was not often taken up by painters before the Renaissance, and Bosch {{is one of the}} best known early artists to take on the scene. Typically, this episode of the Passion takes one of two forms. One representation details a literal narration of the event, with the implied conclusion that the judgement offered by one's contemporaries is often, as the art historian Michael Worton wrote, [...] "flawed, blind, and riven with self-interest." [...] This is the tradition to which this work belongs: Christ is shown to be utterly human and is shown as a stooped, humiliated, man. Later High Renaissance depictions focus on the heroic sacrifice Christ is making for the sake of mankind, and often eliminate the jeering mob altogether, to show an accepting Christ almost looking forward to death.|$|E

5000|$|Among the Protestant nominations, the Quakers were {{distinct}} {{for their}} rejection {{of music in}} worship. They argued that congregational singing was an <b>empty</b> <b>form,</b> and hence worshipped in silence until someone was moved to spontaneous ministry. David Willson, in contrast, began to [...] "sing in the ministry" [...] as early as 1811. He regarded music as another facet of the ministry, a spontaneous expression of God's word. He was to boast, [...] "I never repeat one communication twice over, nor sing one old hymn in worship: bread from heaven is our lot - descending mercies." [...] The constant production of new hymn lyrics, like manna from heaven, [...] "were composed to suit the occasion on which they were sung." [...] These hymns, eventually numbering in the thousands, were recorded in a special [...] "Book of Sacred Record" [...] stored in a secret compartment in the Arc at {{the centre of the}} Temple. At {{the beginning and end of}} each worship service, Willson would [...] "read out" [...] a hymn, line by line, which would then be sung back by the choir, and then the congregation. The lining out of hymns had been the traditional singing style of the 18th century, when hymn books were expensive and rare. Songs were sung a cappella, resulting in slow, improvised singing in which each singer was allowed to decorate the tunes as he or she saw fit.|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} and thermal stability of empty and peptide-filled {{forms of the}} murine class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule I-E(k) were studied at neutral and mildly acidic pH. The two forms have distinct circular dichroic spectra, suggesting that a conformational change may accompany peptide binding. Thermal stability profiles indicate that binding of peptide significantly increases the thermal stability of the empty heterodimers at both neutral and mildly acidic pH. Free energies calculated from these data provide a direct measure of this stabilization and show that the <b>empty</b> <b>form</b> of I-E(k) is significantly more stable than that of class I MHC proteins. Furthermore, for the two MHC class II proteins that were analyzed (I-E(k) and I-A(d)), thermal stability was not significantly altered by acidification. In contrast, of four class I MHC molecules studied, three have shown a significant loss in complex stability at low pH. The marked stability exhibited by their <b>empty</b> <b>form,</b> {{as well as their}} resistance to low pH, as observed in this study, correlate well with the ability of class II MHC molecules to traverse and bind peptides in acidic endosomal vesicles...|$|E
