5|$|Among Kefalas' top {{priorities}} is restoring and expanding Colorado's earned <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit,</b> a move which met with resistance from legislative leaders in 2007 due to budget constraints.

5|$|Kefalas also {{sponsored}} {{legislation to}} create an Economic Opportunity/Poverty Reduction Task Force, which he chaired following the regular session.

Blagojevich signed a bill in 2005 that prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, housing, public accommodations, and credit.

25|$|Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code allows an <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> of 2.3 cents/kilowatt-hour (as {{adjusted}} for inflation for 2013) {{for the production of}} electricity from utility-scale wind turbines, geothermal, solar, hydropower, biomass and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy plants. This incentive, the renewable energy Production Tax Credit (PTC), was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (at the value of 1.5 cents/kilowatt-hour, which has since been adjusted annually for inflation). In late 2015 a large majority in Congress voted to extend the PTC for wind and solar power for 5 years and $25 billion. Analysts expect $35 billon of investment for each type.|$|E

25|$|The federal Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit (<b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> on IRS Form 5695) for {{residential}} PV and solar thermal was extended in December 2015 {{to remain at}} 30% of system cost (parts and installation) for systems put into service {{by the end of}} 2019, then 26% until the end of 2020, and then 22% until the end of 2021. It applies to a taxpayer's principal and/or second residences, but not to a property that is rented out. There is no maximum cap on the credit, and the credit can be applied toward the Alternative Minimum Tax, and any excess credit (greater than that year's tax liability) can be rolled into the following year.|$|E

By CBO calculations the household incomes in the first quintile and second quintile have an average Total Federal Tax rate of 1.0% and 3.8% respectively.

500|$|Conversely, Congress {{passed and}} Reagan {{signed into law}} tax {{increases}} of some nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs as Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), Social Security, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA). Despite the fact that TEFRA was the [...] "largest peacetime tax increase in American history," [...] gross domestic product (GDP) growth recovered strongly after the early 1980s recession ended in 1982, and grew during his eight years in office {{at an annual rate}} of 7.9% per year, with a high of 12.2% growth in 1981. Unemployment peaked at 10.8% monthly rate in December 1982—higher than any time since the Great Depression—then dropped during the rest of Reagan's presidency. Sixteen million new jobs were created, while inflation significantly decreased. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, another bipartisan effort championed by Reagan, simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets to four and slashing a number of tax breaks. The top rate was dropped to 28%, but capital gains taxes were increased on those with the highest incomes from 20% to 28%. The increase of the lowest tax bracket from 11% to 15% was more than offset by expansion of the personal exemption, standard deduction, and earned <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit.</b> The net result was the removal of six million poor Americans from the income tax roll and a reduction of income tax liability at all income levels.|$|E
500|$|During Baker's {{first two}} years as governor, the state income tax has dropped to 5.1%. Baker has opposed {{implementing}} a [...] "millionaire's tax," [...] vetoed a vehicle miles traveled tax, originally supported but then opposed extending the state hotel tax to short-term rentals (such as Airbnb), favored a ballot measure that repealed indexing the state gas tax to inflation, signed into law {{an expansion of the}} state earned <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit,</b> opposed the 2016 ballot initiative to legalize the recreational use of marijuana with a 3.75% excise tax levied on sales of marijuana products, and signed into law a six-month delay in the issuance of licenses for retailing marijuana in shops. In 2016, the Massachusetts general fund budget rose by 6.1 percent and the state budget for the 2016 fiscal year had a year-end shortfall of more than $300 million and could be as large $750 million for the following year. In December 2016, Baker unilaterally cut $98 million from the state budget, including many of the $265 million in items that he had vetoed the previous July, $231 million of which the state legislature overrode. The midyear cuts prompted criticism and opposition from State House of Representatives Speaker Robert DeLeo, State Senate President Stan Rosenberg, and State Senate Ways and Means Committee Chair Karen Spilka. However, in February 2017, tax revenues came in 9.1 percent lower than expected and the likelihood of overturning the cuts became unlikely, and in March 2017, Speaker DeLeo stated that reversing those midyear cuts would be [...] "difficult." ...|$|E
