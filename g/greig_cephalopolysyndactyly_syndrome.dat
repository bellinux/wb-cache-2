50|$|Acrocallosal {{syndrome}} (ACLS, ACS, Schinzel-Type) is a rare, heterogeneous, {{autosomal recessive}} disorder 3.

Characteristics of this syndrome include agenesis of the corpus, macrocephaly, hypertelorism, polydactyly, mental and motor retardation 2, craniofacial dysmorphism, hallux dudplication 3, and sometimes palatal clefting 5.

40|$|A {{range of}} phenotypes {{including}} <b>Greig</b> <b>cephalopolysyndactyly</b> and Pallister-Hall <b>syndromes</b> (GCPS, PHS) {{are caused by}} pathogenic mutation of the GLI 3 gene. To characterize the clinical variability of GLI 3 mutations, we present a subset of a cohort of 174 probands referred for GLI 3 analysis. Eighty-one probands with typical GCPS or PHS were previously reported, and we report the remaining 93 probands here. This includes 19 probands (12 mutations) who fulfilled clinical criteria for GCPS or PHS, 48 probands (16 mutations) with features of GCPS or PHS but who {{did not meet the}} clinical criteria (sub-GCPS and sub-PHS), 21 probands (6 mutations) with features of PHS or GCPS and oral-facial- digital syndrome, and 5 probands (1 mutation) with nonsyndromic polydactyly. These data support previously identified genotype-phenotype correlations and demonstrate a more variable degree of severity than previously recognized. The finding of GLI 3 mutations in patients with features of oral-facial-digital syndrome supports the observation that GLI 3 interacts with cilia. We conclude that the phenotypic spectrum of GLI 3 mutations is broader than that encompassed by the clinical diagnostic criteria, but the genotype-phenotype correlation persists. Individuals with features of either GCPS or PHS should be screened for mutations in GLI 3 even if they do not fulfill clinical criteria. Hum Mutat 31 : 1142 - 1154, 2010.

50|$|There is {{evidence}} that the autosomal dominant disorder <b>Greig</b> <b>cephalopolysyndactyly</b> <b>syndrome</b> (GCPS) that affects limb and craniofacial development in humans is caused by a translocations within the GLI3 gene.|$|E
50|$|Different genetic changes {{involving}} the Gli3 gene can cause <b>Greig</b> <b>cephalopolysyndactyly</b> <b>syndrome.</b> In some cases, the condition {{results from a}} chromosomal abnormality, such as a large deletion or translocation of genetic material, {{in the region of}} chromosome 7 that contains the GLI3 gene. In other cases, a mutation in the GLI3 gene itself is responsible for the disorder. Each of these genetic changes prevents one copy of the gene in each cell from producing any functional protein.

40|$|Abstract Background Knowledge of the {{consequences}} of heterozygous mutations of developmentally important genes is important for understanding human genetic disorders. The Gli 3 gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor and homozygous loss-of-function mutations of Gli 3 are lethal. Humans heterozygous for mutations in this gene suffer <b>Greig</b> <b>cephalopolysyndactyly</b> or Pallister-Hall <b>syndromes,</b> in which limb defects are prominent, and mice heterozygous for similar mutations have extra digits. Here we examined whether eye development, which is abnormal in mice lacking functional Gli 3, is defective in Gli 3 +/- mice. Results We showed that Gli 3 is expressed in the developing eye but that Gli 3 +/- mice have only very subtle eye defects. We then generated mice compound heterozygous for mutations in both Gli 3 and Pax 6, which encodes another developmentally important transcription factor known to be crucial for eye development. Pax 6 +/-; Gli 3 +/- eyes were compared to the eyes of wild-type, Pax 6 +/- or Gli 3 +/- siblings. They exhibited a range of abnormalities of the retina, iris, lens and cornea that was more extensive than in single Gli 3 +/- or Pax 6 +/- mutants or than would be predicted by addition of their phenotypes. Conclusion These findings indicate that heterozygous mutations of Gli 3 can impact on eye development. The importance of a normal Gli 3 gene dosage becomes greater {{in the absence of a}} normal Pax 6 gene dosage, suggesting that the two genes co-operate during eye morphogenesis. </p...|$|R

40|$|Contiguous gene syndromes cause {{disorders}} via haploinsufficiency for adjacent genes. Some contiguous gene syndromes (CGS) have stereotypical breakpoints, {{but others}} have variable breakpoints. In CGS that have variable breakpoints, {{the extent of}} the deletions may be correlated with severity. The <b>Greig</b> <b>cephalopolysyndactyly</b> contiguous gene <b>syndrome</b> (GCPS‐CGS) is a multiple malformation syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of GLI 3 and adjacent genes. In addition, non‐CGS GCPS can be caused by deletions or duplications in GLI 3. Although fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) can identify large deletion mutations in patients with GCPS or GCPS‐CGS, it is not practical for identification of small intragenic deletions or insertions, {{and it is difficult to}} accurately characterise {{the extent of the}} large deletions using this technique. We have designed a custom comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) array that allows identification of deletions and duplications at kilobase resolution in the vicinity of GLI 3. The array averages one probe every 730  bp for a total of about 14 [*] 000 probes over 10  Mb. We have analysed 16 individuals with known or suspected deletions or duplications. In 15 of 16 individuals (14 deletions and 1 duplication), the array confirmed the prior results. In the remaining patient, the normal CGH array result was correct, and the prior assessment was a false positive quantitative polymerase chain reaction result. We conclude that high‐density CGH array analysis is more sensitive than FISH analysis for detecting deletions and provides clinically useful results on the extent of the deletion. We suggest that high‐density CGH array analysis should replace FISH analysis for assessment of deletions and duplications in patients with contiguous gene syndromes caused by variable deletions...|$|R

40|$|Purpose <b>Greig</b> <b>cephalopolysyndactyly</b> (GCPS) (OMIM 175700), a rare {{autosomal}} dominant disorder, {{is characterized by}} a distinct combination of craniofacial, hand and foot malformations. The hand and foot malformations often require orthopedic assessment and treatment. The disorder is caused by point mutations or deletions in the GLI 3 gene, located on chromosome 7 p 14. 3. Herewith, we review the hand and foot malformations in a cohort of 13 patients referred for genetic testing. Methods We reviewed the medical files of 13 patients with GCPS seen at the Center for Human Genetics in Leuven between 2003 and 2005. Clinical, molecular and radiological findings, when available, were recorded. Results We identified six different point mutations in the GLI 3 gene, two microdeletions and three larger chromosomal deletions. In the hands, preaxial polydactyly was never observed, but the malformations included postaxial polydactyly, broad thumbs, clinodactyly of the thumbs and various degrees of syndactyly. In the feet the spectrum of malformations included preaxial polydactyly, postaxial polydactyly, different degrees of syndactyly and broad halluces. Syndactyly of the toes and hallux abnormalities were present in all patients. Most frequently, syndactyly was present between toes 1 – 2 – 3. The broadening of the hallux was either due to a complete or partial duplication of the first toe or to broadening of the distal phalanx. Mental retardation was found in three cases and was associated with a large chromosomal deletion of the GLI 3 region.

Our results showed 38 children (38 / 110 or 34. 6 %) who {{had at least one}} additional structural abnormality or had a known syndromic diagnosis were classed as having syndromic MS. Chromosomal abnormalities were noted in 8 / 38 (21. 4 %) children: mosaic marker chromosome 2, 9 p deletion (2 / 8), 11 q deletion, 12 pter deletion and duplication of 15 q 25 with other additional chromosomal abnormalities (3 / 8). Other syndromic diagnoses included Silver-Russell <b>syndrome</b> and <b>Greig</b> <b>cephalopolysyndactyly.</b> Prenatal exposure to sodium valproate (VPA) was noted in 8 / 110 children (7. 8 %), with the dose of the VPA being >or= 1, 000 mg/day in all cases. Other prenatal exposures reported in this study were: maternal diabetes (6 / 110), enoxaparin for hypercoagulable state (1 / 110), and thyroxine (1 / 110). The majority of patients (72 / 110 or 65. 4 %) had nonsyndromic MS. Speech delay was present in 11 children with nonsyndromic MS (11 / 72 or 15. 3 %) and 10 children with syndromic MS (10 / 38 or 26. 3 %). We conclude that approximately two-thirds of all MS is nonsyndromic. Prenatal exposure to VPA is a common cause of MS. Maternal diabetes, not previously linked to MS, was noted in 5. 5 % of cases.

In addition, a combination of chromosome prometaphase banding and DNA marker studies has allowed the localisation of the genes for retinoblastoma and for Wilms' tumour and the clarification of both the autosomal recessive nature of the mutation and the possible somatic mutations by which the normal allele can be lost in retina and kidney cells. After a number of X linked genes had been mapped, discrete deletions in the X chromosome were detected by prometaphase banding with specific attention paid to the sites of the gene(s) in males who had from one to up to four different X linked disorders plus mental retardation. Furthermore, the detection of balanced translocations in probands with disorders caused by autosomal dominant or X linked genes has allowed a better insight into the localisation of these genes. In some females with X linked disorders, balanced X; autosomal translocations have allowed the localisation of X linked genes at the breakpoint on the X chromosome.
