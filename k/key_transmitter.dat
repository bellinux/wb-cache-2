40|$|Urine {{storage and}} {{micturition}} are tightly {{controlled by the}} peripheral and central nervous systems. The parasympathetic pelvic nerves mediate signals for voiding, whereas the sympathetic hypogastric and the somatic pudendal nerves mediate signals for urine storage. Glutamate is a <b>key</b> <b>transmitter</b> of the descending neuronal pathways during the storage phase of the micturition cycle. Its effects on {{the activity of the}} hypogastric and pudendal nerves are modulated by serotonin and/or noradrenaline. Duloxetine inhibits the neuronal uptake of serotonin and noradrenaline and thereby enhances their effects in the central nervous system including the spinal nuclei responsible for urine storage. Thus, in a bladder irritation model in anaesthetised cats duloxetine dose-dependently restored bladder capacity and enhanced activity of the external urethral sphincter/rhabdosphincter. Such effects should prove beneficial in the treatment of patients with stress urinary incontinence. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserve...|$|E
40|$|NeuromedinU is {{a potent}} {{regulator}} of food intake and activity in mammals. In Drosophila, neurons producing the homologous neuropeptide hugin regulate feeding and locomotion in a similar manner. Here, we use EM-based reconstruction to generate the entire connectome of hugin-producing neurons in the Drosophila larval CNS. We demonstrate that hugin neurons use synaptic transmission in addition to peptidergic neuromodulation and identify acetylcholine as a <b>key</b> <b>transmitter.</b> Hugin neuropeptide and acetylcholine are both necessary for the regulatory effect on feeding. We further show that subtypes of hugin neurons connect chemosensory to endocrine system by combinations of synaptic and peptide-receptor connections. Targets include endocrine neurons producing DH 44, a CRH-like peptide, and insulin-like peptides. Homologs of these peptides are likewise downstream of neuromedinU, revealing striking parallels in flies and mammals. We propose that hugin neurons {{are part of an}} ancient physiological control system that has been conserved at functional and molecular level.

40|$|Dopamine (DA) is a {{neurotransmitter}} in {{the central}} nervous system as well as in peripheral tissues. Emerging evidence however points to DA also as a <b>key</b> <b>transmitter</b> between the nervous system and the immune system as well as a mediator produced and released by immune cells themselves. Dopaminergic pathways have received so far extensive attention in the adaptive branch of the immune system, where they play a role in health and disease such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and Parkinsonâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s disease. Comparatively little is known about DA and the innate immune response, although DA may affect innate immune system cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, microglia, and neutrophils. The present review aims at providing a complete and exhaustive summary of currently available evidence about DA and innate immunity, and to become a reference for anyone potentially interested in the fields of immunology, neurosciences and pharmacology. A wide array of dopaminergic drugs is used in therapeutics for non-immune indications, such as Parkinsonâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s disease, hyperprolactinemia, shock, hypertension, with a usually favorable therapeutic index, and they might be relatively easily repurposed for immune-mediated disease, thus leading to innovative treatments at low price, with benefit for patients {{as well as for the}} healthcare systems...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{evidence}} shows a reliable association between psychosis-prone (especially schizotypal) personality traits and performance on dopamine (DA) -sensitive tasks (e. g., prepulse inhibition and antisaccade). Here, we used blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI and an established procedural learning task {{to examine the}} dopaminergic basis of two aspects of psychosis-proneness (specific schizotypy and general psychoticism). Thirty healthy participants (final N= 26) underwent fMRI during a blocked, periodic sequence-learning task which, in previous studies, {{has been shown to}} reveal impaired performance in schizophrenia patients given drugs blocking the DA D 2 receptor subtype (DRD 2), and to correspond with manipulation of DA activity and elicit fronto-striatal-cerebellar activity in healthy people. Psychosis-proneness was indexed by the Psychoticism scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ-R; 1991) and the Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA; 1984). EPQ-R Extraversion and Neuroticism scores were also examined to establish discriminant validity. We found a positive correlation between the two psychosis-proneness measures (r= 0. 43), and a robust and unique positive association between EPQ-R Psychoticism and BOLD signal in the putamen, caudate, thalamus, insula and frontal regions. STA schizotypy score correlated positively with activity in the right middle temporal gyrus.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that ATP is a mediator of central (within the ventral surface of the medulla) and peripheral (within the carotid body) chemosensory transduction. This short review discusses the data obtained in experiments in vivo and in vitro supporting this hypothesis. P 2 receptors for ATP are expressed within the ventrolateral medulla as wen as by the peripheral chemosensory afferent neurones. Blockade of P 2 receptors in the ventrolateral medulla attenuates the CO 2 -induced increase in respiration while blockade of purinergic signalling impairs carotid body function and diminishes the ventilatory response to hypoxia. Furthermore, ATP is released from the ventral surface of the medulla during hypercapnia and from the carotid body during hypoxia. Finally, exogenous ATP applied on the ventral surface of the medulla evokes rapid increase in phrenic nerve activity, while ATP applied to the carotid body evokes marked excitation of the carotid sinus nerve afferents. We suggest that in the ventrolateral medulla ATP is produced following CO 2 /H+-induced activation of central chemosensory elements (neuronal and/or glial) and acts within the respiratory network to produce physiologically relevant changes in ventilation. In the carotid body, ATP contributes in a significant manner to the transmission of {{the sensitivity of the}} carotid body to changes in arterial Po- 2 and may be considered as a <b>key</b> <b>transmitter</b> released by chemoreceptor cells to activate endings of the sinus nerve afferent fibres...|$|E

This study focused on developing an electrochemical array device that could be utilised to conduct multi-site measurements of 5 -HT overflow from the entire colon. A 3 D printed mould was fabricated that could house 6 multi-wall carbon nanotube composite electrodes and provide a fixed distance between the electrodes and the tissue along {{the entire length of}} the colon. The electrodes were assessed for sensitivity, stability and crosstalk before conducting in vitro measurements using colons obtained from 6 and 24 month old mice. As composite electrodes can have a high degree of variability, normalisation factors were required between electrodes for a given array. The device had the sensitivity and stability required for 5 -HT measurements from intestinal tissue. Regio-specific changes in 5 -HT overflow were observed with age, where increases in 5 -HT overflow were observed in the distal colon due to an impairment/loss in the serotonin transporter (SERT).

Here, we compare the features of one-trial reward conditioning with an alternative aversive conditioning paradigm where quinine {{was used as the}} US while the CS was the same (amyl acetate) as in reward conditioning. Here, a single pairing of CS and US led to aversive conditioning. An electrophysiological correlate of both types of conditioning was measured in semi-intact preparations. The same CS caused excitation or inhibition {{depending on the type of}} the training. The source of the inhibition in case of aversive conditioning appears to be in non-feeding ganglia in the rest of the brain. Our results indicate that the same CS can trigger alternative responses depending on the type of training (US). These two types of responses involve different pathways within the CNS. The sensitivity of the aversive and appetitive memory trace to NO, dopamine and octopamine blockers was also studied. We established that while NO and dopamine are important in the development of a long-term appetitive memory trace at an early stage after conditioning they do not play a role in aversive memory formation. Octopamine, on the other hand is not needed for appetitive memory formation, but seems to be the <b>key</b> <b>transmitter</b> needed shortly after aversive training...|$|E
40|$|Dopamine (DA) is a <b>key</b> <b>transmitter</b> in the basal ganglia, yet DA {{transmission}} {{does not}} conform to several aspects of the classic synaptic doctrine. Axonal DA release occurs through vesicular exocytosis and is action potential- and Ca 2 + -dependent. However, in addition to axonal release, DA neurons in midbrain exhibit somatodendritic release by an incompletely understood, but apparently exocytotic, mechanism. Even in striatum, axonal release sites are controversial, with evidence for DA varicosities that lack postsynaptic specialization, and largely extrasynaptic DA receptors and transporters. Moreover, DA release is often assumed to reflect a global response to a population of activities in midbrain DA neurons, whether tonic or phasic, with precise timing and specificity of action governed by other basal ganglia circuits. This view has been reinforced by anatomical evidence showing dense axonal DA arbors throughout striatum, and a lattice network formed by DA axons and glutamatergic input from cortex and thalamus. Nonetheless, localized DA transients are seen in vivo using voltammetric methods with high spatial and temporal resolution. Mechanistic studies using similar methods in vitro have revealed local regulation of DA release by other transmitters and modulators, {{as well as by}} proteins known to be disrupted in Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. Notably, the actions of most other striatal transmitters on DA release also do {{not conform to}} the synaptic doctrine, with the absence of direct synaptic contacts for glutamate, GABA, and acetylcholine (ACh) on striatal DA axons. Overall, the findings reviewed here indicate that DA signaling in the basal ganglia is sculpted by cooperation between the timing and pattern of DA input and those of local regulatory factors.

40|$|In mammals, the {{ventilatory}} {{response to}} decreased oxygen {{tension in the}} arterial blood is initiated by excitation of specialized O 2 -sensitive chemoreceptor cells in the carotid body that release neurotransmitters to activate endings of the sinus nerve afferent fibers. We investigated the role of ATP acting via ionotropic P 2 X receptors in the carotid body function and ventilatory response to hypoxia in mice. Mice deficient in P 2 X 2 receptor subunit showed a markedly attenuated ventilatory response to hypoxia, whereas the response to hypoxia in P 2 X 3 -deficient mice was comparable with that seen in wild-type controls. P 2 X 2 and P 2 X 3 receptor subunit deficiency {{did not affect the}} ventilatory responses to hypercapnia. P 2 X 2 subunit deficiency resulted in a dramatic reduction in the responses of the carotid sinus nerve to hypoxia in the in vitro carotid body–sinus nerve preparation. ATP and its stable analog,-methyleneATP both evoked rapid excitation of sinus nerve afferents, and the P 2 receptor antagonist PPADS (pyridoxal- 5 -phosphate- 6 -azophenyl- 2, 4 -disulphonic acid) (100 M) blocked hypoxia-induced increase in sinus nerve discharge. Immunoreactivities for P 2 X 2 and P 2 X 3 subunits were both detected on afferent terminals surrounding clusters of glomus cells in the wild-type animals but were absent in mice deficient in P 2 X 2 and P 2 X 3 receptor subunits. These observations provide the first definitive evidence that, in the carotid body, ATP is a <b>key</b> <b>transmitter</b> released by chemoreceptor cells to activate endings of the sinus nerve afferent fibers.

DRD 1 rs 4532 and rs 686 and DRD 5 rs 6283 were associated with total lymphocytes, and with CD 3 + and CD 4 + (but not CD 8 +) T lymphocytes, while none of the D- 2 -like DR gene variants showed any association with lymphocyte counts. An arbitrary score based on the activity of D- 1 -like vs D- 2 -like DR correlated with total lymphocytes, CD 3 + and CD 4 + T cells (but not with CD 8 + T cells). The association between D- 1 -like DR gene variants and lymphocyte count, and in particular with CD 4 + (but not CD 8 +) T lymphocytes, may imply a functional prevalence of D- 1 -like over D- 2 -like DR in CD 4 + T cells. This is the first study showing an influence of DR gene polymorphisms on lymphocyte count, and in particular on CD 4 + T cells. Future studies should address the possible association between DR gene variants and the immune function in health and disease. The relevance of these findings for the immune effects of dopaminergic agents should be also carefully examined. (C) 2015 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics...|$|E
