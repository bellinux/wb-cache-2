40|$|International audienceThe genus Echinococcus is {{composed}} of eight generally recognized species and one genotypic cluster (Echinococcus canadensis cluster) that may in future be resolved into one to three species. For each species, we review existing information on transmission routes and life cycles in different geographical contexts and - where available - include basic biological information of parasites and hosts (e. g., susceptibility of host species). While some Echinococcus spp. are transmitted in life cycles that involve predominantly domestic animals (e. g., dog - livestock cycles), others are wildlife parasites that do or do not interact with domestic transmission. In many cases, life cycle patterns of the same parasite species differ according to geography. Simple life cycles contrast with transmission patterns that are highly complex, involving multihost systems that may include both domestic and wild mammals. Wildlife transmission may be primary or secondary, i. e., resulting from spillovers from domestic animals. For most of the species and regions, existing information does not yet permit a conclusive <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> systems.

40|$|The {{ever greater}} share of {{renewable}} energy sources (RES) in the European energy market stresses the transmission grid to its limits with rising frequency. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a spatially and temporally detailed model of the European power system {{to serve as a}} basis for investigating the efficient integration of RES. Here we outline a far-reaching <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> grid operation and present a review of approaches developed for modeling the physical power flows and the respective congestion management techniques that control them. By this, we hope to equip the interdisciplinary energy research community with a better understanding of power systems and corresponding modeling tools, thus enhancing their respective efforts. Additionally, a literature review and classification of existing studies on these topics is included in the paper as well. The analysis shows that the fundamental modeling components determining power flows across power systems include the electricity market, the inter-zonal power trading and the intra-zonal congestion management models, where a complete incorporation of all of them requires an iterative or multi-level approach. However, due to the high complexity of such an approach, most common and computationally efficient strategies apply integrated approaches using linearized descriptions for the physical flows...|$|E

40|$|Pneumocystis jirovecii is {{an unusual}} ascomycetous fungus that can be {{detected}} in the lungs of healthy individuals. Transmission from human to human {{is one of its}} main characteristics in comparison with other fungi responsible for invasive infections. P. jirovecii is transmitted through the air between healthy individuals, who are considered to be the natural reservoir, at least transiently. In immunocompromised patients, P. jirovecii multiplies, leading to subacute infections and acute life-threatening pneumonia, called Pneumocystis pneumonia [PCP]. PCP is caused by genotypically distinct mixtures of organisms in more than 90 % of cases, reinforcing the hypothesis that there is constant inhalation of P. jirovecii from different contacts over time, although reactivation of latent organisms from previous exposures may be possible. Detection of P. jirovecii DNA without any symptoms or related radiological signs has been called “colonization”. This situation could be considered as the result of recent exposure to P. jirovecii that could evolve towards PCP, raising the issue of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for at-risk quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) -positive immunocompromised patients. The more accurate way to diagnose PCP is the use of real-time quantitative PCR, which prevents amplicon contamination and allows determination of the fungal load that is mandatory to interpret the qPCR results and manage the patient appropriately. The detection of P. jirovecii in respiratory samples of immunocompromised patients should be considered for potential risk of developing PCP. Many challenges still need to be addressed, including a better <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission,</b> characterization of organisms present at low level, and prevention of environmental exposure during immunodepression...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Background: RSV is {{the most}} {{important}} cause of serious respiratory disease in young children, but transmission among children is not well-characterized. Molecular sequencing of the hypervariable glycoprotein (G) coding portion of the RSV genome allows for <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> dynamics. Methods: We prospectively followed children enrolled in full-time childcare during 3 winter seasons. We collected nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs at enrollment and with illness episodes. The child's caregiver completed a symptom diary. Samples were tested for 12 respiratory viruses by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. We developed a heminested PCR assay to amplify and sequence a region of the RSV G protein. Data were analyzed using GEEs and univariate linear regression models. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the maximum likelihood method. Results: RSV was detected in 62 (12 %) of 523 illness episodes. Compared to RSV-negative illness episodes, RSV-positive illness episodes were associated with longer symptom duration, more childcare and work days missed, and increased frequency of health care visits. The median log 10 viral copies/mL was 7. 50 (2. 6 - 10. 0). In 42 (68 %) of RSV-positive swabs, another respiratory virus was detected. There was no correlation between RSV viral load and age at illness onset or presence of other respiratory viruses. We observed three RSV outbreaks with a predominance of subtype B in season 1 (21 / 27) and subtype A in seasons 2 (7 / 8) and 3 (20 / 27). In two rooms, 50 % of the children had RSV detected within 6 days of the first case, and 75 % within 10 days. Sequencing was performed for 27 (44 %) of RSV illness episodes. Seven identical strains were isolated in season 1, and 9 identical strains were isolated in season 3. These clusters were distinct from reference sequences, as well as viruses isolated during separate time periods in the childcare facility. Conclusions: Our study examined the impact and spread of RSV in a multiyear community-based prospective childcare study using molecular techniques. These data demonstrate that RSV is readily transmitted within enclosed settings, and that it {{is the most}} important respiratory viral cause of symptoms and health care utilization among children in the community...|$|E
