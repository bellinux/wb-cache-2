5|$|Following Ruland's {{departure}} in 1863, the Queen {{looked for}} a husband for Helena. However, as a middle child, {{the prospect of a}} powerful alliance with a European royal house was low.

Furthermore, Victoria insisted that Helena's future husband had to be prepared to live near the Queen, thus <b>keeping</b> <b>her</b> daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; however, the match was politically awkward, and caused a severe breach within the royal family.|$|E
