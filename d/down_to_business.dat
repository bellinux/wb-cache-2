In the following rooms, André Lhote, Segonzac, La Fresnaye etc. would take their place. It was at this moment that we got to know each other.|$|E

The receptionist nevertheless phoned James, who promptly came out of his office, welcomed Epstein and quickly got <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>business.</b> Epstein played the single and James remarked that it was a number one record. Epstein replied that if James could achieve that then he would be prepared to offer him a long-term publishing deal. James then phoned Philip Jones, producer of ITV television show Thank Your Lucky Stars, played the song down the telephone to him and gained The Beatles a slot on the next edition of the programme. The two then shook hands on a deal that would make them, and the Beatles, extremely wealthy.|$|E
500|$|Clarke's {{style has}} {{frequently}} {{been described as}} a pastiche, particularly of nineteenth-century British writers such as Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and George Meredith. Specifically, the novel's minor characters, including sycophants, rakes, and the Duke of Wellington, evoke Dickens' caricatures. Laura Miller, in her review for Salon, suggests that the novel is [...] "about a certain literary voice, the eminently civilized voice of early 19th century social comedy", exemplified by the works of Austen. The novel even uses obsolete spellings—chuse for choose and shewed for showed, for example—to convey this voice as well as the free indirect speech made famous by Austen. Clarke herself notes that Austen's influence is particularly strong in the [...] "domestic scenes, set in living rooms and drawing rooms where people mostly chat about magic" [...] where Dickens's is prominent [...] "any time there's more action or description". While many reviewers compare Clarke's style to that of Austen, Gregory Feeley argues in his review for The Weekly Standard that [...] "the points of resemblance are mostly superficial". He writes that [...] "Austen gets <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>business</b> briskly, while Clarke engages in a curious narrative strategy of continual deferral and delay." [...] For example, Clarke mentions Jonathan Strange on the first page of the novel, but only in a footnote. He reappears in other footnotes throughout the opening but does not appear as a character in the text proper until a quarter of the way through the novel.|$|E
