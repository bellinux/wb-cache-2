5|$|Teklemariam {{was born}} in Addis Ababa, before he left Ethiopia with his family {{at the age of}} nine. When he arrived in the United States, he was {{introduced}} to skiing while at school in Lake Placid. After leaving full time education, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted to compete internationally in the sport.|$|E
5|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, Henry {{increasingly}} wanted {{to resolve the}} question of the inheritance. <b>He</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would divide up his empire after his death, with Young Henry receiving England and Normandy, Richard being given the Duchy of Aquitaine, and Geoffrey acquiring Brittany. This would require the consent of Louis as king of France, and accordingly Henry and Louis held fresh peace talks in 1169 at Montmirail. The talks were wide-ranging, culminating with Henry's sons giving homage to Louis for their future inheritances in France, and with Richard being betrothed to Louis's daughter Alice.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{spent most}} of this time {{exploring}} on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could {{write a book about}} geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E

5|$|By 1949 Swift was 35 years old, but {{was still}} {{performing}} well enough to maintain {{his place in the}} England team. However, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted to retire while still capable of playing at the top level, rather than fading away. To this end he announced that he would retire {{at the end of the}} 1948–49 season. He made what he intended to be his last Manchester City appearance against Huddersfield Town on 7 May, which was followed by a parade in his honour organised by the Supporters' Club. However, just before the next season started, Swift's replacement Alec Thurlow fell ill with tuberculosis, and Swift agreed to step in until City found a new goalkeeper. Four further appearances took his career total to 338. Aware of attempts by other clubs to tempt Swift out of retirement, most notably by Manchester United, the Manchester City board continued to hold Swift's playing registration for several years.|$|E
5|$|Simović named Maček as Deputy Prime Minister {{once again}} in the new government, but Maček was {{reluctant}} and remained in Zagreb while he decided what to do. While he considered the coup had been an entirely Serbian initiative aimed at both Prince Paul and the Cvetković–Maček Agreement, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> needed to show HSS support for the new government and that joining it was necessary. On 4 April he travelled to Belgrade and accepted the post, on several conditions; that the new government respect the Cvetković–Maček Agreement and expand the autonomy of the Banovina Croatia in some respects, that the new government respect the country's accession to the Tripartite Pact, and that one Serb and one Croat temporarily assume the role of regents. That same day exiled Croatian politician and Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić called for Croats to start an uprising against the government over his Radio Velebit program based in Italy.|$|E
5|$|The case {{first went}} to the High Court of Justice, where it was heard by Fulford J; <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{did not have the}} {{authority}} to overrule Bonnard, and passed the case on to the Court of Appeal after granting a temporary injunction. In the Court of Appeal, the case was heard by May, Dyson and Brooke LJJ, with Brooke delivering the judgment on 5 November 2004. In it, Brooke judged that defamation, the subject of Greene, was significantly different from breach of confidentiality, the subject in Cream. While the damage from a breach of confidentiality can never be undone, justifiying a simple test for issuing injunctions, a defamation case that is won vindicates the injured party. Making it easier to grant injunctions in defamation cases would damage the delicate balance between freedom of the press and the right to privacy; as such, despite the Human Rights Act, Bonnard is still a valid test.|$|E

5|$|Whitehead was demobilized {{from the}} Army in January 1919, and {{returned}} to the University of Kansas, earning a Bachelor of Engineering degree in 1920. After graduation, he took a job with The Wichita Eagle as a reporter in order to earn enough money for law school. In the end though, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> preferred flying. He applied for a commission in the Regular Army, and was re-commissioned as a first lieutenant in the Air Service, on 11 September 1920. On 25 September 1920, he married Mary Nicholson, whom he had known while at the University of Kansas. They had two children: a daughter, Margaret, born in 1921, who later became a lieutenant in the United States Air Force, and a son, Ennis C. Whitehead, Jr., who was born in 1926 and graduated from West Point in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E

His brother Phil also became a racing driver, and co-drove with his brother in the Bathurst 1000 on two occasions.|$|E
25|$|Lam {{was first}} {{interested}} in astronomy as a Primary 6 student.

He obtained an A in Physics in the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination, although the grade was not sustained in the A-levels, where he received an A for all other subjects he took up.|$|E
50|$|An {{owner of}} a {{detached}} house on 3 acre is transferred by his employer to another state.

25|$|Although Symonds was {{originally}} qualified {{to play for}} England due to it being the country of his birth, and West Indies due to his ancestry, in 1995 <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wished to pursue an international career for Australia instead. His international debut came on 10 November 1998, when he played in a One Day International (ODI) for Australia against Pakistan at Lahore.

Because he was not with the Latter-day Saints in Utah, Cowdery was not immediately given a position of responsibility in the church, but in July 1849 Young wrote Cowdery a letter inviting him to travel to Washington, D.C., with Almon W. Babbitt to publicize the State of Deseret's desire for statehood and to draft a formal statehood application. Cowdery's deteriorating health did not allow him to accept this assignment, and within eight months he had died.|$|E
