25|$|Jeffrey Herbst <b>has</b> <b>written</b> <b>extensively</b> <b>on</b> {{the impact}} of state {{organization}} in Africa.

25|$|Oviraptorosaurs, like deinonychosaurs, are so bird-like {{that several}} {{scientists}} consider {{them to be}} true birds, more advanced than Archaeopteryx. Gregory S.

Michael Benton, in his widely respected text Vertebrate Paleontology, also included oviraptorosaurs as an order within the class Aves.

For example, Bostrom <b>has</b> <b>written</b> <b>extensively</b> <b>on</b> existential risks to humanity's future welfare, including ones that could be created by emerging technologies.|$|E

JSLint scans JavaScript code for conformance {{to a set of}} standards and guidelines. Many libraries for JavaScript, such as three.js, provide links to demonstration code that can be edited by users. They are also used as a pedagogical tool by institutions such as Khan Academy to allow students to experience writing code in an environment where they can see the output of their programs, without needing any setup beyond a Web browser.|$|E
