Several studies of minor actinide burners promote a fast neutron reactor in which minor actinides can be incinerated efficiently by fission.

Ratio surrogate data on <b>fission</b> <b>probabilities</b> of 232 Th(6 Li, 4 He) 234 Pa and 232 Th(6 Li,d) 236 U by Nayak et al., 2008, support the predicted 233 Pa(n, F) cross section at En= 11. 5 - 16. 5 MeV. The predicted trends of 230 - 232 Pa(n, F) cross section up to En= 20 MeV, are consistent with fissilities of Pa nuclides, extracted by 232 Th(p,F) (Isaev et al., 2008) and 232 Th(p, 3 n) (Morgenstern et al., 2008) data analysis. The excitation energy and nucleon composition dependence of the transition from asymmetric to symmetric scission for fission observables of Pa nuclei is defined by analysis of p-induced fission of 232 Th at Ep= 1 - 200 MeV. Predominantly symmetric fission in 232 Th(p,F) at En(p) = 200 MeV as revealed by experimental branching ratios (Dujvestijn et al., 1999) is reproduced. Steep transition from asymmetric to symmetric fission with increase of nucleon incident energy is due to fission of neutron-deficient Pa (A≤ 229) nuclei. A structure of the potential energy surface (a drop of f f symmetric and asymmetric fission barriers difierence (EfSYM - EfASYM) from ~ 3. 5 MeV to ~ 1 MeV) of N-deficient Pa nuclides (A≤ 226) and available phase space at outer fission saddles, are shown {{to be responsible for}} the sharp increase with En(p) of the symmetric fission component contribution for 232 Th(p,F) and 230 - 233 Pa(n, F) reactions.
