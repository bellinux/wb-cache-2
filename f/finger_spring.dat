This allows one to quickly and easily grasp small objects or tissue to move and release it or to grasp and hold tissue with easily variable pressure. Thumb forceps are used to hold tissue in place when applying sutures, to gently move tissues out of the way during exploratory surgery and to move dressings or draping without using the hands or fingers.|$|E

Upstream of the valve orifice is a flexible, convoluted metal diaphragm attached to the orifice poppet. Downstream of the valve orifice, a <b>finger</b> <b>spring</b> exerts a force against the valve poppet, tending to keep the valve in a closed position. The series arrangement of a double seat and poppet is able to tolerate small particle contamination while minimizing chatter by controlling throttling or metering across the secondary seat, thus preserving the primary sealing surface...|$|E
40|$|Several {{etiological}} {{factors for}} gingival recession {{have been discussed}} in the literature, and the vestibular region of the mandibular incisors is a critical anatomical area {{for the emergence of}} this condition. Anterior crossbite is an important factor, because the trauma from occlusion between the incisors generates an imbalance in the distribution of forces, causing changes in the periodontium and making the area more susceptible to mechanical trauma during brushing and to plaque formation. In view of these aspects, the objective of this paper was to demonstrate the influence of early treatment of anterior crossbite on the gingival margin level and risk of gingival recession in the region of the incisors. A case of anterior crossbite treated during the mixed dentition phase was used as an example.

50|$|In this appliance, the <b>fingers</b> <b>springs</b> are {{the main}} {{component}} which act against the 1st molars to move them distally. These springs apply about 100 to 125g of force to the molars after they are activated posteriorly. The original appliance developed by Margolis included helices next to the laterals and canines for a straight pull or Northwest headgear tubes to be inserted. This appliance is specifically indicated for adolescents or pre-adolescents patients who are in mixed dentition and are very compliant.|$|R
40|$|Background/purpose: Anterior {{crossbite}} correction {{is common}} in orthodontic treatment; however, few studies have discussed the change with cephalometric measurements. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the dentofacial changes in anterior crossbite correction by using an upper lingual arch with <b>finger</b> <b>springs.</b> Materials and methods: This retrospective study included 30 patients (13 female and 17 male). According to the number of crossbite teeth, the patients were divided into three groups. We used paired t test, Kruskal–Wallis test, Mann–Whitney U test, and multiple regression analysis to perform statistical analysis. Results: According to overall treatment changes, the dental changes included overjet increase, overbite decrease, upper incisor proclination, lower incisor retroclination and intrusion, upper molar distal tipping with extrusion, and lower molar intrusion. These dental changes resulted in clockwise mandibular rotation and lip position change. Anterior crossbite correction did not require increasing bite appliances. According to multiple regression analysis, the change in overjet was associated with the position of the upper and lower incisor crown tips. The mean rate of upper incisor movement in the horizontal direction was 2. 5  mm/mo. The treatment duration exhibited no significant difference among the three groups. Conclusion: Lingual arch with <b>finger</b> <b>springs</b> was effective in anterior crossbite correction regardless of the number of crossbite teeth...|$|R
5000|$|Dietz et al. {{recommended}} that to avoid tipping of molar teeth, a high pull headgear {{can be used}} in conjunction with this appliance. As the ACCO appliance will move the crown of molar distally, headgear will act to move the molar roots distally. In order to avoid loss of anchorage, they also recommended to achieve [...] "overcorrection" [...] of the molar distalization by 2mm or more. Anchorage loss occurs as anterior teeth move mesially, shown by 2mm increase in overjet and also 1st molars moving mesially. The authors also stated that presence of 2nd molars can exacerbate the loss of anchorage. Therefore, addition of <b>finger</b> <b>springs</b> can be added to the 2nd molars to move them distally also.|$|R

Prototype units were evaluated for the following specific defects associated with the 95 Sn- 5 Sb (Sn-Sb, wt. %) solder joint used to attach the beryllium-copper (BeCu) <b>spring</b> <b>fingers</b> to the aluminum (Al) connector shell: (1) extended cracking within the fillet; (2) remelting of the solder joint during the follow-on, soldering step that attached the EMR adapter ring to the connector shell (and/or soldering the EMR shell to the adapter ring) that used the lower melting temperature 63 Sn- 37 Pb (Sn-Pb) alloy; and (3) spalling of the Cd (Cr) layer overplating layer from the fillet surface. Several pedigrees of connectors were evaluated, which represented older fielded units as well as those assemblies that were recently constructed at Kansas City Plant. The solder joints were evaluated that were in place on connectors made with the current soldering process as well as an alternative induction soldering process for attaching the EMR adapter ring to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely the EMR adapter ring to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely reflected the different extents to which the connector was mated to its counterpart assembly. In all cases, the <b>spring</b> <b>finger</b> solder joints on the SA 1358 - 10 connectors were remelted {{as a result of the}} subsequent EMR adapter ring attachment process. Spalling of the Cd (Cr) overplating layer was also observed for these connectors, which was a consequence of the remelting activity. On the other hand, the SA 2052 - 4 connector did not exhibit evidence of remelting of the <b>spring</b> <b>finger</b> solder joint. The Cd (Cr) layer did not show signs of spalling. These results suggested that, due to the size of the SA 1358 - 10 connector, any of the former or current soldering processes used to attach the EMR adapter ring and/or EMR shell to the connector shell, requires a level of heat energy that will always result in the remelting of the <b>spring</b> <b>finger</b> solder joint attached with either the Sn-Ag or the Sn-Sb alloy. Lastly, it was construed that the induction soldering process, which is used to attach the EMR adapter ring onto the shell, was more likely to have caused the remelting event rather than the more localized heat source of the hand soldering iron used to attach the EMR shell to the adapter ring...|$|R
