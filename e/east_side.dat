5|$|Passing through rural Osceola County and {{providing}} access to rural communities such as Le Roy and Tustin, US131 approaches {{the south side of}} Cadillac in Wexford County. At exit176, M-55 leaves a concurrency with M-115 and joins the US131 freeway around the <b>east</b> <b>side</b> of Cadillac. This bypass was built in the early 21st century and the old routing is now a business loop through downtown. M-55 follows the freeway to exit180 while US131 continues around the <b>east</b> <b>side</b> of Cadillac and north around the <b>east</b> <b>side</b> of Manton. The lowest freeway traffic counts along US131, 7,455cars and 709trucks in 2009, are on the northeast side of Manton, as the trunkline transitions back to a two-lane undivided highway before meeting the north end of Manton's business loop.|$|E
