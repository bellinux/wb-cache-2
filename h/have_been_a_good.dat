5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, it would not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E

Buckley believes Charnwood to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea but one that proved better in concept than in execution, influenced as it was by the mounting political pressure on 21st Army Group to produce results.

Due to his belief that the purchase of commissions should be abolished, Woodford sold his commission to the government for £4,500, half of its market value.

Since the work of [5], there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of comparative study of Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) and HPSG. 1 Much of this work has shown how analyses in one formalism can be translated into the other.

25|$|There {{is nothing}} solid {{left in the}} Players' Protective Association. There has been no {{activity}} {{on the part of}} the present officials, and there will be none. The organization has been allowed to die because the members have seen nothing in it to interest them. Some are not pleased with the officers; others object to the paying of dues, while others still believe that they can do better by themselves than by acting in concert with all the other players; and so the Players' Protective Association gradually is being allowed to die out. One hears but little of it now, and in a year from now will hear less. It would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing for the players if they had been true to its principles and the officials had been active in carrying out all its aims and laws. However, there was failure on all sides, and the result is that the organization gradually is fading out of existence.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} C.H. Firth {{opined that}} Lilburne had gained a great reputation for courage {{and seems to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> officer, but his military career was unlucky. He spent about six months in prison at Oxford, was plundered of all he had at Rupert's relief of Newark (22 March 1644), was shot through the arm at the taking of Walton Hall, near Wakefield (3 June 1644), and received very little pay. His arrears {{when he left the}} service amounted to £880. He also succeeded in quarrelling, first with Colonel King and then with the Earl of Manchester, both of whom he regarded as lukewarm, incapable, and treacherous. He did his best to get King cashiered, {{and was one of the}} authors of the charge of high treason against him, which was presented to the House of Commons by some of the committee of Lincoln in August 1644. The dispute with Manchester was due to Lilburne's summoning and capturing Tickhill Castle against Manchester's orders, and Lilburne was one of Cromwell's witnesses in his charge against Manchester.|$|E

Konstantin received the Marble Palace in St.Petersburg as a wedding gift from his parents with Strelna, on the Gulf of Finland, as their country retreat. A year after his marriage Konstantin inherited Pavlovsk from his uncle Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich, and, at the death of his mother, the palace of Oreanda in Crimea.|$|E

[...] Peary described the film as being [...] "disjointed and stylistically erratic" [...] and [...] "a testament to wastefulness in the bigger-is-better cinema," [...] before adding, [...] "It would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea to cut the picture drastically, perhaps down to the scenes featuring Peter Sellers and Woody Allen.

In addition, as the appointed captain in four series against Australia, he was beaten in each one, something no other England captain has repeated. Gibson suggests that [...] "the excuses begin to run thin, sieved through such a tale of failure." [...] Gibson summarises that [...] "England under MacLaren must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> side to watch, save for the passionate partisans, but an uncomfortable side in which to play...
