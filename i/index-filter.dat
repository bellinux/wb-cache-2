40|$|XML path queries {{form the}} basis of complex {{filtering}} of XML data. Most current XML path query processing techniques can be divided in two groups. Navigation-based algorithms compute results by analyzing an input document one tag at a time. In contrast, index-based algorithms take advantage of precomputed numbering schemes over the input XML document. In this paper we introduce a new indexbased technique, <b>Index-Filter,</b> to answer multiple XML path queries. <b>Index-Filter</b> uses indexes built over the document tags to avoid processing large portions of the input document that are guaranteed not to be part of any match. We analyze <b>Index-Filter</b> and compare it against Y-Filter, a stateof -the-art navigation-based technique. We show that both techniques have their advantages, and we discuss the scenarios under which each technique is superior to the other one. In particular, we show that while most XML path query processing techniques work off SAX events, in some cases it pays off to preprocess the input document, augmenting it with auxiliary information {{that can be used to}} evaluate the queries faster. We present experimental results over real and synthetic XML documents that validate our claims...|$|E
40|$|At {{the request}} of DG JUST, the JRC {{presented}} in February 2016 this short report with a preliminary assessment of a possible successful introduction of a new Automatic Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) functionality in ECRIS. The report provides a technical assessment of the proposed decentralized privacy-preserving approach based on a pseudonymized <b>index-filter</b> shared by all Member States (MS) and lists the main technical and architectural challenges.

40|$|Summary: SeqMap is a {{tool for}} mapping large amount of short {{sequences}} to the genome. It is designed for finding all the places in a reference genome where each sequence may come from. This task {{is essential to the}} analysis of data from ultra high throughput sequencing machines. With a carefully designed <b>index-filtering</b> algo-rithm and an efficient implementation, SeqMap can map tens of millions of short sequences to a genome of several billions of nu-cleotides. Multiple substitutions and insertions/deletions of the nu-cleotide bases in the sequences can be tolerated and therefore detected. SeqMap supports FASTA input format and various output formats, and provides command line options for tuning almost every aspect of the mapping process. A typical mapping can be done in a few hours on a desktop PC. Parallel use of SeqMap on a cluster is also very straightforward. ...|$|R
