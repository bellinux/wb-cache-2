40|$|The Puu pathway is a putrescine {{utilization}} pathway involving gamma-glutamyl intermediates. The genes encoding the enzymes of the Puu pathway form a gene cluster, the puu gene cluster, and puuP {{is one of}} {{the genes}} in this cluster. In Escherichia coli, three putrescine importers, PotFGHI, PotABCD, and PotE, were discovered in the 1990 s and have been studied; however, PuuP had not been discovered previously.

A puuP+ strain absorbed up to 5 mM putrescine from the medium, but a ΔpuuP strain did not.

Similar comparisons were made in 15 of these patients using cultures from the external urethral meatus and proximal urethra. <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> <b>were</b> <b>grown</b> from the vaginal introitus, urethral meatus and proximal urethra at 41, 66 and 26 % of visits respectively. Overall they were not significantly more often isolated when patients had cystitis, and the serotype was unrelated to symptoms. <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> <b>was</b> cultured significantly more often from the introital swabs of symptomatic intermittently bacteriuric (IB) women than from symptomatic persistently non-bacteriuric (NB) patients; and more often from symptomatic than from asymptomatic IB patients, although this difference was not significant. These findings were consistent with previous suggestions that symptoms of apparently "abacterial" cystitis in IB patients are due to occult coliform infection. We found no direct evidence that <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> <b>were</b> the cause of symptoms in persistently non-bacteriuric women, or that urethral colonisation caused them. However <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> <b>were</b> isolated from the introitus of control women only half as often as from both intermittently bacteriuric and persistently non-bacteriuric patients...|$|R
