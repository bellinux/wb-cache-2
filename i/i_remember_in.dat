500|$|Collins first {{performed}} with Sting at Wembley, {{and together they}} performed [...] "In the Air Tonight", [...] "Against All Odds", [...] "Long Long Way to Go" [...] and [...] "Every Breath You Take", accompanied by saxophonist Branford Marsalis. After Collins finished performing, he flew on Concorde to the Live Aid show in Philadelphia. On the plane, he met Cher, and convinced {{her to be a}} part of the event. Once there he met Robert Plant, who had asked him if he would perform with him, Jimmy Page and Tony Thompson in a Led Zeppelin [...] "reunion" [...] of sorts. He first played drums on [...] "Layla", [...] "White Room" [...] and [...] "She's Waiting" [...] for friend Eric Clapton. Then, Collins performed [...] "Against All Odds" [...] and [...] "In the Air Tonight", and finished the night playing drums for Led Zeppelin's aforementioned act. The band has claimed that the performance was unspectacular, and critics place the blame on Collins. However, Collins says that [...] "I would pledge to my dying day that it wasn't me," [...] and that Thompson was racing through some of the performance. Collins later remarked, [...] "... <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the thing, I actually thought, How do I get out of here?" [...] Stephen Williams of Newsday commented that Collins' performance of [...] "In the Air Tonight" [...] in Philadelphia [...] "was one of the more moving moments of the day". Live Aid raised $69 million in its effort. Collins later recalled the event as [...] "extraordinary".|$|E

[...] "Joel {{got off the}} phone with Universal and said, “We’re dead.” We sat down, <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>in</b> a little park. In {{downtown}} LA. And we started giggling, in that way people do when things are terrible... There’s the song in the movie called “Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young.” And <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>in</b> the park, Joel saying, “Today Is What It Means to be Dead.”" ...|$|E

That's where, in the absence of alternatives, Al Jazeera English can fill a vacuum, simply because we’re going in the opposite direction." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robert Peel, {{often called}} the [...] "model Prime Minister", {{was the first to}} {{recognise}} this new role. After the successful Conservative campaign of 1841, J. W. Croker said in a letter to Peel, [...] "The elections are wonderful, and the curiosity is that all turns on the name of Sir Robert Peel. It's the first time that <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>in</b> our history that the people have chosen the first Minister for the Sovereign. Mr. Pitt's case in '84 is the nearest analogy; but then the people only confirmed the Sovereign's choice; here every Conservative candidate professed himself in plain words to be Sir Robert Peel's man, and on that ground was elected." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>in</b> 1915 when I {{was deeply}} {{involved}} in cubist sculpture but was still in many ways not certain of what I was doing, I had {{a visit from the}} writer Jules Romains, and he asked me what I was trying to do. I answered, [...] "I would like to make an art as pure as a crystal." [...] And he answered in a slightly mocking way, [...] "What do you know about crystals?" [...] At first I was upset by this remark and his attitude, but then, as I began to think about it, I realized that I knew nothing about crystals except that they were a form of inorganic life and that this was not what I wanted to make.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{coverage}} of the moon landing itself, ITV used computer captions such as [...] "Armstrong taking manual control" [...] and [...] "Touchdown, The Eagle has landed". The captions were made by listening to the Houston-Lunar Module talkback, then entering in computer codes, which translated the Eagle's speed and altitude into on-screen information. Paul Haney described the moonwalk on {{the coverage}} as [...] "the greatest thing to happen since fish crawled up on the beach and survived." [...] On the landing he remarked the landing was only four miles off the point projected [...] "which is pretty good for Government work". Reminiscing in 1999, ITN producer David Nicholson remembered it as [...] "perhaps the most exciting twelve minutes I've ever seen on television. It was a hugely thrilling moment. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>in</b> the ITN control room there was a gasp from the production staff." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 November 1956 Butler, who had just {{announced}} British withdrawal, addressed the 1922 committee (Conservative backbenchers) with Macmillan. After Butler's downbeat remarks, ten minutes or so in length, Macmillan delivered a stirring thirty-five minute speech described by Enoch Powell as [...] "one of the most horrible things that <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>in</b> politics … (Macmillan) with all the skill of the old actor manager succeeded in false-footing Rab. The sheer devilry of it verged upon the disgusting." [...] He expounded on his metaphor that henceforth the British must aim to be [...] "Greeks in the Roman Empire", and according to Philip Goodhart's recollection almost knocked Butler off his chair with his expansive arm gestures. Macmillan wrote [...] "I held the Tory Party for the weekend, it was all I intended to do". Macmillan had further meetings with Aldrich and Winston Churchill after Eden left for Jamaica (23 November) while briefing journalists (disingenuously) {{that he planned to}} retire and go to the Lords. He was also hinting that he would not serve under Butler.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the 1922 Committee on 22 November 1956, Rab Butler made a speech {{appealing}} for party unity {{in the aftermath of the}} Suez Crisis. His speech did not go down well and Harold Macmillan, whom Butler had taken along for moral support, addressed them and was a great success. In Powell's view this was [...] "one of the most horrible things that <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>in</b> politics... seeing the way in which Harold Macmillan, with all the skill of the old actor-manager, succeeded in false-footing Rab. The sheer devilry of it verged upon the disgusting". After Macmillan's death in 1986 Powell said [...] "Macmillan was a Whig, not a Tory... he had no use for the Conservative loyalties and affections; they interfered too much with the Whig's true vocation of detecting trends in events and riding them skilfully so as to preserve the privileges, property and interests of his class". However, when Macmillan replaced Eden as Prime Minister, Powell was offered the office of Financial Secretary to the Treasury on 14 January 1957. This office was the Chancellor of the Exchequer's deputy and the most important job outside the Cabinet.|$|E
2500|$|... "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] {{proved to}} be a {{crossover}} hit, charting across several different radio formats; in addition to peaking at number one on the Alternative Songs chart in June and number three on the Rock Songs chart in July, the song broke into the top 40 of the Hot 100 in late July and appeared on the Adult Top 40 and Mainstream Top 40 charts. Columbia senior VP of promotion Lee Leipsner said, [...] "It was one of the only alternative bands <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>in</b> a while that you could actually dance to. And the fact that the record has a groove and rhythmic feel to it—not heavy guitar-based at all—gave us a wide opportunity to cross the record." [...] He credits the song's crossover success and push into the top 40 to a June presentation of new music by Tom Poleman of Clear Channel. According to Leipsner, [...] "After we showed our presentation, we had so many Clear Channel major-market programmers come up to us and say, 'The record I want to play besides Adele is Foster the People.'" [...] "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] peaked at number three on the Hot 100, spending eight consecutive weeks at the position. According to Nielsen Soundscan, over 321,000 copies of Torches have been sold in the US. [...] "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] finished 2011 as the sixth-best-selling digital song of the year, with 3.84 million copies sold.|$|E

2500|$|Artists {{from the}} metal and hard rock {{community}} also paid homage to Jackson. Metallica {{paid tribute to}} Jackson during its encore at the Sonisphere Festival. Honoring Michael Jackson during its July 4 headlining appearance at the event, the band played a portion of 'Beat It' before easing into a riotous cover of Queen's 'Stone Cold Crazy'. Boston hard rockers Extreme performed a cover version of Jacksons's [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] at the Midnight Rodeo in Amarillo, Texas. Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill, spoke about Jackson in an interview for an internet blog: [...] "He was an immense star, wasn't he? Let's face it. He's a worldwide superstar really and the grief that everybody's is showing, it doesn't surprise me at all. He was a very, very talented man." [...] Members of the legendary metal band Black Sabbath released official statements regarding Jackson's death. Drummer Bill Ward: [...] "For those in heartache today, I wish you all wellness in healing. A great entertainer has died. I think those who experienced and heard his heart are more enlightened people for it than before. I believe you're all most fortunate to have connected to Michael Jackson." [...] Bassist Geezer Butler: [...] "Saddened and shocked to hear of the passing of Michael Jackson. He truly was, and always will be, a true icon. 'Thriller' {{was one of the}} greatest pop masterpieces of all time. A sad day for our world. R.I.P." [...] Legendary shock rocker, Alice Cooper released the following statement: [...] "Michael Jackson was easily as influential as James Brown, and that's saying a lot. We had Vincent Price in common. I used him first on 'Welcome To My Nightmare' in 1975, and he later used him on 'Thriller'. Nobody moved like Michael, he was truly the King of Pop." [...] Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, who worked with Jackson during the recording of Thriller, stated: [...] "I am really shocked; as I'm sure the world is, to hear the news. I had the pleasure of working with Michael on 'Beat It' back in '83 — one of my fondest memories in my career. Michael will be missed and may he rest in peace." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May stated in his official website: [...] "Hard to know what to say — what to feel. I find myself wondering what might have happened on his tour... The number of dates in the U.K. that he had committed to was insane. I did have a feeling it was impossible, but I was so shocked to hear that he went so suddenly. Very sad. Of course, I still think of him as a boy — he used to come and see us (Queen) play when we were on tour in the States, and he and Freddie Mercury became close friends, close enough to record a couple of tracks together at Michael's house. Tracks which have never seen the light of day. Michael was the boy star of the Jackson Five, and always the most screamed at. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>in</b> their show, they tried very hard to make all the brothers equal in the presentation, but it was abundantly obvious that all most of the girl fans really wanted to see was little Michael. It was Michael who heard our track 'Another One Bites the Dust' when he came to see us on 'The Game' tour ... and told us we were mad if we didn't release it as a single." [...] Former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash, who played guitar on Jackson's single [...] "Give In to Me" [...] stated: [...] "Really sad news about Michael. He was a talent from on high." [...] Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave performed a cover version of [...] "Billie Jean" [...] on June 27, 2009, at the Peace & Love festival in Borlänge, Sweden. Steve Vai and Andy Timmons of Danger Danger performed an instrumental version of [...] "Beat It" [...] at the Meinl Guitar Festival 2009 on June 27 in Gutenstetten, Germany. Former Skid Row frontman, Sebastian Bach commented: [...] "Another angel down... I am very sorry for my friend Jermaine's loss. I lived with Jermaine for three weeks last year (during the filming of the second season of CMT's hit series, 'Gone Country'), and we talked about his brother frequently. He said to me, 'When you cut up my brother, you're cutting up me'. I feel for the Jackson family, because I know all too well how they feel. Unfortunately." [...] Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche stated: [...] "I grew up listening to Michael Jackson, watching him and his brothers perform on television. He made performing seem easy and inspired my generation with his music and his grace. He was one of a kind and will be missed but his music will live forever." [...] Legendary Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen recorded [...] "Beat It" [...] with ex-Judas Priest/Iced Earth frontman Tim [...] "Ripper" [...] Owens on vocals. Guitarist Buckethead wrote a song entitled [...] "The Homing Beacon", inspired by Jackson's 3-D film, Captain EO. Alternative metal band CKY performed [...] "Beat It" [...] for the duration of their [...] "Carver City" [...] Tour. In some instances, guitarist Chad I Ginsburg wore T-shirts depicting Jackson during the performances.|$|E
