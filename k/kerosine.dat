The Avro 720's main power-plant was an 8,000lbf (36kN) Armstrong Siddeley Screamer rocket engine, using liquid oxygen as oxidant and <b>kerosine</b> fuel. This differed from the competing Saunders-Roe SR.53, which used a de Havilland Spectre rocket engine which was powered by Hydrogen Peroxide and <b>kerosine.</b> Both types were equipped with a single 1,750lbf (7.8kN) Armstrong-Siddeley Viper as the auxiliary turbojet engine; on the Avro design, airflow for the Viper engine was provided via a small chin inlet installed under the aircraft's nose. Operationally, the Avro 720 {{was to have been}} armed with a pair of de Havilland Firestreak Infrared homing air-to-air missiles, which could be carried upon underwing pylons.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of oil refining {{led to the}} availability of kerosene as lamp oil, which has a smokeless combustion {{in contrast with the}} until then highly used whale oil. The lamp oil became known as Pennsylvania <b>Kerosine.</b> Due to overfishing, whale oil became rare and expensive. By this time, petroleum oil had already begun to supplant fish, whale, and vegetable oils for applications such as indoor and outdoor lighting, and transatlantic export had already begun.|$|E
25|$|The Avro 720 was {{intended}} {{to have been a}} high performance aircraft that would have utilised mixed propulsion to accomplish this, using a rocket engine to achieve quick acceleration and a high top speed while a more compact jet engine would have been used during more mundane cruising flight. The termination of the aircraft had been partially due to its choice in powerplant, Avro having opted to utilise the in-development Armstrong Siddeley Screamer rocket engine, which used liquid oxygen as oxidant and <b>kerosine</b> fuel; major questions were posed over the oxidant's practicality under operational situations.|$|E

25|$|The bluff's {{nature as}} a solitary outlier of the range gives it a greater range, in one place, of {{habitats}} and flora than elsewhere in the Great Western Tiers. The plants and trees found on the bluff are common {{to the rest of}} the range however, unlike the rest of the range, Quamby Bluff's summit does not show evidence of burning or grazing damage. The mountain has a mixture of habitats including eucalypt forest, rainforest and subalpine vegetation. On the mountain's southern half there are some patches of callidendrous rainforest which are dominated by myrtle (Nothofagus cunninghamii) and sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum) trees with mother shield ferns (Polystichum proliferum), and tree ferns in the gullies. There are scattered king billy pines (Athrotaxis selaginoides) on southern slopes, indicating long periods between bushfires. Other rainforest sections contain some Stringybark trees (Eucalyptus delegatensis). These forests on the mountain were formerly of mixed eucalyptus. High altitude and loggingevidenced by remaining stumpshave changed its character. Other sections contain mixed forest containing stringybark, myrtle, sassafras and dogwood (Pomaderris apetala), with a silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) understorey. Sections have some treeferns, mother shield fern, bat's wing fern (Histiopteris incisa) and kangaroo fern (Microsorum pustulatum). In other areas there is a dryer forest dominated by eucalypts. Messmate Stringybark (eucalyptus obliqua) and stringybark grow over an understorey of silver wattle, dogwood, bracken (Pteridium esculentum) and fireweed. In these sections there is evidence in the flora's pattern of repeated burnings. Eucalyptus dalrympleana and some Australian blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon) occur higher up, with a mixed understorey. The summit is exposed and wind-swept. Here there are mostly low and wind-pruned shrubs including: Narrow-Leaf Orites (Orites revolutus), Baeckea gunniana, Common Shaggy-pea (Oxylobium ellipticum, Leptospermum rupestre, Richea sprengelioides, Richea scoparia and <b>Kerosine</b> Bush (Ozothamnus hookeri).|$|E

2500|$|Kerosene, {{also known}} as paraffin, lamp oil, and coal oil (an {{obsolete}} term), is a combustible hydrocarbon liquid which is derived from petroleum, widely used as a fuel in industry as well as households. Its name derives from [...] (keros) meaning wax, and was registered as a trademark by Canadian geologist and inventor Abraham Gesner in 1854 before evolving into a genericized trademark. It is sometimes spelled <b>kerosine</b> in scientific and industrial usage. The term kerosene is common in much of Argentina, Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, and the United States, while the term paraffin is used in Chile, eastern Africa, South Africa, and in the United Kingdom, and the term lamp oil is common in majority of Asia. Liquid paraffin (called mineral oil in the US) is a more viscous and highly refined product which {{is used as a}} laxative. Paraffin wax is a waxy solid extracted from petroleum.|$|E

50|$|Through the years, Mobil {{was among}} the largest sellers of {{gasoline}} and motor oils in the United States and even held the top spot during the 1940s {{and much of the}} 1950s. Various Mobil products during the Socony-Vacuum and Socony-Mobil years included Metro, Mobilgas and Mobilgas Special gasolines; Mobilfuel Diesel, MobilHeat and Mobil-flame heating oil, Mobil <b>Kerosine,</b> Lubrite, Gargoyle, Mobiloil and Mobiloil Special motor oils; Mobilgrease, Mobillubrication, Mobil Upperlube, Mobil Freezone and Permazone antifreezes, Mobilfluid automatic transmission fluid, Mobil Premiere tires, Mobil Stop-Leak, and Mobil Lustrecloth, among many others.|$|E
50|$|The {{improved}} powerplant had its stroke lifted by 10 mm {{while the}} bore remained the same. The displacement was lifted to 12.6 litres {{which resulted in}} increased horsepower and torque. For military variants the engines were capable of running on alternative fuels (mixtures of diesel fuel, gasoline and or aviation <b>kerosine</b> fuel), albeit with a performance loss. The air cooling system was retained once again with the cooling fan driven via hydraulic clutch and engine oil temperature controlled. The fuel injection pumps featured different types variable or combination governors depending on the vehicle application.|$|E
5000|$|A {{direct current}} flowing in a solenoid creates a strong {{magnetic}} field around a hydrogen-rich fluid (<b>kerosine</b> and decane are popular, and even {{water can be}} used), causing some of the protons to align themselves with that field. The current is then interrupted, and as protons realign themselves with the [...] magnetic field, they precess at a frequency that is directly proportional to the magnetic field. This produces a weak rotating magnetic field that is {{picked up by a}} (sometimes separate) inductor, amplified electronically, and fed to a digital frequency counter whose output is typically scaled and displayed directly as field strength or output as digital data.|$|E
50|$|This was {{developed}} independently by R L Blaine of the American National Bureau of Standards, {{and uses a}} small glass <b>kerosine</b> manometer to apply suction to the powder bed. It differs from the above methods in that, because of uncertainty of {{the dimensions of the}} manometer tube, absolute results can't be calculated from the Carman equation. Instead, the apparatus must be calibrated, using a known standard material. The original standards, supplied by NBS, were certified using the Lea and Nurse method. Despite this shortcoming, the Blaine method is now by far the most commonly used, mainly because of the ease of maintenance of the apparatus and simplicity of the procedure.|$|E
50|$|Sporadic clashes {{continued}} on 18 May, but these skirmishes were less intense than some previous confrontations had been. The death toll rose to 39 {{as the day}} progressed, and {{it is widely believed}} that a military crackdown is imminent as troops and APC's gathered around the protest site urging residents and protestors to leave, declaring that a military operation is soon to commence. The Army moved in soon afterwards, backed by armoured personnel carriers and smashed through the protestors main barricades. Two Red-Shirts were shot and wounded during the opening stages of this operation as other Red-Shirts set alight the <b>kerosine</b> soaked barricades to deter advancing soldiers and obscure their view.|$|E
