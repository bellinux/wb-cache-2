40|$|The {{influence}} of the non-ideal response of the pulse-amplifier on the trap <b>and</b> <b>self-heating</b> dynamics, <b>and</b> hence, on the drain-current transient in a GaN HEMT is studied with new trap <b>and</b> <b>self-heating</b> models. It is shown {{that the study of}} the trap <b>and</b> <b>self-heating</b> dynamics requires a proper correction technique that accounts for the change in trap-potential, trap time-constant and thermal response due to the non-ideal response of the pulse-amplifier. Several post-measurement data correction techniques are discussed and shown to be incapable of predicting the true drain-current transient. A pre-measurement terminal correction technique using {{a new version of the}} pulse measurement system is used to solve the problem. 7 page(s...|$|R
