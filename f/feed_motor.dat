40|$|In modern {{manufacturing}} processes, {{there is}} an ever increasing demand for higher productivity. The continuous demand for higher productivity and product quality asks for better understanding and control of machining processes by reducing machining time {{with the increase of}} cutting force and material removal rate. The variation in cutting force results in deflection in the tool and workpiece and which intern deteriorates geometrical accuracy. One of the methods of improving productivity and quality lies in fact, to develop monitoring system which can control and maintain the cutting force at a prescribed level by adjusting cutting parameters using adaptive control technique. The cutting force is one of the important characteristic variables to be monitored in the cutting processes.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Previous {{research}} {{indicated that}} the evolution of <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> pat-terns across major taxonomic groups might have occurred without large modifi-cations of {{the control of the}} jaw and hyolingual muscles. However, the proposal of this evolutionary scheme was hampered by the lack of data for some key taxa such as lizards. Recent data on jaw and hyolingual <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> patterns of a number of lizard families suggest extensive variability within and among species. Although most lizards respond to changes in the structural properties of food items by mod-ulating the activation of the jaw and hyolingual muscles, some food specialists might have lost this ability. Whereas the overall similarity in motor patterns across different lineages of lizards is large for the hyolingual muscles, jaw muscle acti-vation patterns seem to be more flexible. Nevertheless, all data suggest that both the jaw and hyolingual system are complexly integrated. The elimination of feed-back pathways from the hyolingual system through nerve transection experiments clearly shows that feeding cycles are largely shaped by feedback interactions. Yet, novel motor patterns including unilateral control seem to have emerged in the evolution from lizards to snakes...|$|R

The present study reports {{the effects of}} SCPB on the activity of specified buccal neurons and {{the expression of the}} <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> program of the terrestrial slug, Limax maximums. Superfusion of an isolated CNS preparation with 10 − 6 M SCPB results in a 3 – 4 -fold increase in the burst frequency of the fast salivary burster neuron (FSB), while having no effect on the activity of another endogenous burster, the bilateral salivary neuron (BSN).

The buccal ganglion of each species possessed {{a pair of}} large, dorsal–lateral, whitish neurons that contained an SCPB-like peptide. We refer to these neurons as the SLB (SCPB-immunoreactive Large Buccal) cells. In all species examined, the SLB cells project out the gastroesophageal nerves and appear to innervate the esophagus. In each species, an apparent rhythmic <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> program (FMP) was observed by intracellular recording from both SLB neurons and other neurons in isolated preparations of the buccal ganglia.

40|$|Animals {{interact}} with their environment based on stereotypical movement patterns, such as those performed during running, breathing or feeding. Hox regulatory genes had been known to be essential for establishing coordinated movements, but the molecular underpinnings of feeding behaviour were not well understood. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, the present work demonstrates that a specific Hox gene, Deformed, controls {{the establishment of a}} motor unit in the fly's head during embryonic development. This unit comprises a muscle and a set of stimulating neurons and enables feeding-related movements. The loss of functional Deformed caused severe defects {{in the formation of the}} <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> unit and subsequently led to death. Furthermore, inactivation of Deformed at the end of embryogenesis, once the motor unit was successfully assembled, uncovered a novel role for Deformed in maintaining the functionality and integrity of the motor unit later in life. Finally, perturbations in motor behaviour were pinned to the role of Deformed in the control of molecules essential for synapse stability at the junctions between neurons and muscles. One of the identified direct targets of Deformed is Ankyrin, a molecule previously shown to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Hence, the results presented here suggest that Hox genes might have a neuroprotective function and once this function is gone, the neurons degenerate, a hypothesis that will be of interest to study in the future. Interestingly, Deformed is co-expressed in muscles and neurons forming the functional <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> unit, pointing at its role as a master regulator of feeding behaviour. In support of this hypothesis, Deformed was shown to act as one of the negative upstream regulators of Connectin, a molecule essentially required for the correct matching between the two partners. Is the function of Hox transcription factors in the establishment of <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> units conserved across the animal phylogeny? This work uncovered a fly neural regulatory element of Deformed, which contains highly conserved Hox-binding sites, to be active in neurons located within the hindbrain of the vertebrate fish model Oryzias latipes, suggesting that the transcriptional network controlling the assembly and function of the feeding unit in fish and flies is conserved...|$|R

To meet the most demanding requirements of CNC machine tools, robots and transfer lines in terms of productivity, accuracy and dynamic performance, brushless DC drives are very widely used.

40|$|Lung metastases are {{frequently}} removed with an Nd:YAG laser. The {{aim is to}} perform a non-anatomic resection of all intraoperatively palpable lung metastases completely {{in order to preserve}} the largest possible amount of healthy lung parenchyma. The surgeon can either work with a focusing handpiece or use a laser fiber of the so-called bare fiber with direct contact to the lung parenchyma. We currently use a 600 µm bare fiber for applications involving the lung parenchyma. Precise data on the local effect of the laser fiber on the lung parenchyma are not available, especially with regard to an increase in the laser energy. We want to study this question within the scope of an experimental model in pig lungs by means of systematic and reproducible tests. The lung lobes were removed from animals recently slaughtered in the abattoir and taken to the laboratory immediately, where the lobes were stored such that the surface of the lungs was parallel to the floor. A 600 µm bare fiber was attached to a mounting bracket vertically above the lung surface at a distance of either 0, 5, or 10 mm. This mounting bracket was in turn connected to a hydraulic <b>feed</b> <b>motor.</b> The <b>feed</b> <b>motor</b> is capable of moving the bare fiber forward across the lungs consistently at three different speeds (5 mm/s, 10 mm/s, or 20 mm/s). The bare fiber itself was connected to the diode-pumped Nd: YAG Laser LIMAX® 120 (Gebrüder Martin GmbH & Co KG, Tuttlingen, Germany). We carried out the tests using three different laser powers: 20 W, 60 W, and 120 W. The lung lesions caused by the laser in each of the lungs were resected and sent in for histological analysis. The exact size of the vaporization and coagulation zone was measured using the HE sections, and the respective mean values (with standard deviations) were ascertained. For all laser powers, the extent of the vaporization was greatest with a motion speed of 5 mm/s for the respective laser power: 756. 4 ± 1. 2 µm (20 W), 1411. 0 ± 2. 3 µm (60 W) and 2126. 0 ± 1. 4 µm (120 W). At the same time, the extent of the coagulation zone decreased with a consistent speed: 221. 8 ± 2. 9 µm (20 W), 324. 9 ± 1. 8 µm (60 W), and 450. 5 ± 1. 8 µm (120 W). With a consistent laser energy and increasing speed, we also saw a decrease {{in the size of the}} vaporization and of the coagulation zone. The same applies for an increasing distance of the bare fiber to the lung surface. The coagulation effect is the dominant effect here. At an operating speed of 5 mm/s and a maximum laser energy of 120, the 600 µm bare fiber exerts a maximum effect. With an increasing distance of the tip of the bare fiber to the lung surface, the coagulation effect is dominant. The effect of the laser decreases with increasing operating speeds...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{increase}} machining efficiency and minimize costs, research into tool condition monitoring (TCM) systems has focused on developing methods to allow for unmanned machining. For drilling processes, such systems typically use indirect approaches to monitoring the tool condition by measuring spindle torque and feed force as well as vibrations including acoustic emission (AE – mechanical vibrations faster than 100 kHz). This project aimed to advance the state-of-the-art {{in the area of}} TCM by developing a method to detect sudden tool failures in large diameter (> 25 mm) indexable insert drills. This project was a continuation of the research conducted by Mr. R. Griffin (a former MSc student), who developed a model capable of predicting long term wear trends in indexable insert drills [1]. Notably, his model was unable to react to sudden tool breakage due to tool chipping, which was addressed by this project as presented in this thesis. In order to develop and train models able to detect sudden tool failure, an experiment was developed and installed in the field of the industry partner of this project. The experiment’s main feature was a pair of AE sensors added to the existing torque and force sensors. On this setup, experiments were conducted by drilling 2251 holes in workpieces using indexable insert drills with or without the insert breaking. When drilling holes without the insert breaking, the holes were named as good ones; and when drilling holes with the insert breaking they were named as bad holes. During the drilling process, data was collected from current sensors attached to the spindle motor and <b>feed</b> <b>motor</b> as well as from an AE sensor on the spindle and on the workpiece. From the signals from the spindle motor current and <b>feed</b> <b>motor</b> current sensors, algorithms were developed to identify and divide the signals of drilling a hole into different sections of the drilling cycle (i. e. entrance, steady-state, exit, etc.). Steady-state time-domain features were extracted from the sensor signals measured for all holes drilled in the experiments and the extracted features were used to train and test the classifier models. These models were cross validated to determine which type of model was the best fit for the drilling data collected. The results from the classifier models show that most of the classifiers tested have the ability to identify sudden tool breakage based on the data recorded in the present study, with varying degrees of success. The naïve Bayes classifier was able to detect the most failures but suffered from a large number of falsely detected failures. Both the classification tree and linear discriminant analysis classifiers had lower failure detection rates than the naïve Bayes classifier, but did not suffer from the same amount of false positives; as such, these two classifiers had higher overall classification rates than the naïve Bayes. These results suggest that classification tree and linear discriminant analysis methods are better suited for the drilling application and that the time-domain features should be complemented by others, such as the features extracted from the frequency domain, to accurately diagnose the tool condition. Future research should focus on extracting frequency and time-frequency domain features as these features might contain more information on tool condition. In addition, methods of examining features at the entrance and exit of the holes should be investigated as these two points in the drilling cycle are the most prone to sudden tool failure...|$|E
40|$|Tool Condition Monitoring (TCM) {{methods have}} shown {{significant}} potential to automatically detect worn tools without {{intervention in the}} machining process, thus decreasing machine downtime and improving reliability and part quality. Previous research on TCM systems have used {{a wide variety of}} time-domain and frequency-domain features extracted from cutting force related parameters as well as mechanical and acoustical vibrations to infer the wear state of tools. This project concerns the process of drilling thousands of tight-tolerance holes on tubesheets and baffles of heat exchangers using large diameter indexable insert drills on a horizontal boring machine. To address the issues involved in the process, the aim of this research is to develop a non-intrusive, indirect, online TCM system on the horizontal boring machine to monitor the drill wear and hole quality while drilling. The specific objectives are to establish an indirect TCM system for the drilling process, to develop models to predict tool wear and the machining accuracy of the drilled holes, and to develop an optimum tool replacement strategy. The TCM system developed used two cutting-force related signals on the horizontal boring machine, namely the spindle motor current and the axial <b>feed</b> <b>motor</b> current. Features extracted from these data streams, as well as the machining parameters, the cutting speed and the feed rate, and the number of holes drilled with the current inserts, are the inputs to a series of models to predict the tool wear state and the hole diameter. The first model is an autoregressive model that allows the prediction of the extracted features for the next hole before it is drilled. As each hole is drilled, this model is updated with the most recent data to improve the accuracy of the prediction. The predicted values for the features are then used as inputs to the second and third models which are surface response models, one to estimate the tool wear state and one to estimate the hole diameter. A tool replacement strategy based on applying limits to the predicted hole diameter was also developed. Adjusting these limits allows the strategy to be tuned for either hole accuracy or tool life depending on the requirements of a specific application. Tuning the replacement strategy for tool life resulted in a significant 44 % increase in tool life and a non-trivial reduction in machine down time due to fewer tool changes while holding a hole diameter tolerance of ± 0. 1 mm. The TCM system ensured that not a single over tolerance hole would have been drilled which is critically important since over tolerance holes can result in a scrapped workpiece. The proposed 3 -model TCM system shows promise in being able to significantly reduce the risk of drilling out of tolerance holes {{while at the same time}} increasing tool life and correspondingly decreasing tool change time. The models are able to accurately predict the insert flank wear and as well as the actual hole diameter within acceptable error. The TCM system could be implemented in an industrial settingwith minimal revision and since it is an indirect system there would be no intrusion into the manufacturing operation. One limitation of the TCM system as proposed is that it is only capable of detecting gradual tool wear and not catastrophic tool failure, a limitation that was known from the outset but was not investigated as it was beyond the scope of this project. The proposed TCM system would allow the integration of additional functionality to instantaneously detect catastrophic tool failure. Finally, for use in a production environment, the developed models need to be implemented on a standalone device that requires essentially no operator input to monitor continuous drilling operations for tubesheet and baffle applications. This implementation could include automatic detection of the machining parameters using frequency analysis of the motor signals...|$|E

A trilhadora de arroz de fluxo intermitente de plantas, acionada por motor, apresentou maior capacidade de trilhamento tendo, portanto, melhor desempenho técnico entre as máquinas ensaiadas. As plantas com colmos curtos, em relação às de colmos compridos, proporcionaram maior rendimento no trilhamento. Among all field {{operations}} {{related to the}} rice crop, harvesting {{is one of the}} most important due to its high cost and also because it directly affects grain yield and product quality. Harvesting demands a great portion of the manual labor required in small farms, where the threshing operations are also performed manually by impacting the plants against a hard surface. Mechanical threshing not only improves labor efficiency but also reduces grain breakage during milling. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate the performance of three machines designed for threshing upland and lowland rice cultivars, using three different operational procedures: intermittent plant feeding, pedal operated; intermittent plant <b>feeding,</b> <b>motor</b> operated; and continuous plant <b>feeding,</b> <b>motor</b> operated. In the trials, long and short stemmed plants were used as well as grains with different moisture contents. The machine using the intermittent plant <b>feeding</b> system with <b>motor</b> operation, showed greater threshing capacity than the other two. Short stemmed plants produced higher threshing yields when compared to the long stemmed ones...|$|R
40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is an {{unconventional}} membrane-permeable messenger molecule {{that has been}} shown to play various roles in the nervous system. How NO modulates ion channels to affect neuronal functions is not well understood. In gastropods, NO has been implicated in regulating the <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> program. The buccal motoneuron, B 19, of the freshwater pond snail Helisoma trivolvis is active during the hyper-retraction phase of the <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> program and is located in the vicinity of NO-producing neurons in the buccal ganglion. Here, we asked whether B 19 neurons might serve as direct targets of NO signaling. Previous work established NO as a key regulator of growth cone motility and neuronal excitability in another buccal neuron involved in feeding, the B 5 neuron. This raised the question whether NO might modulate the electrical activity and neuronal excitability of B 19 neurons as well, and if so whether NO acted on the same or a different set of ion channels in both neurons. To study specific responses of NO on B 19 neurons and to eliminate indirect effects contributed by other cells, the majority of experiments were performed on single cultured B 19 neurons. Addition of NO donors caused a prolonged depolarization of the membrane potential and an increase in neuronal excitability. The effects of NO could mainly be attributed to the inhibition of two types of calcium-activated potassium channels, apamin-sensitive and iberiotoxin-sensitive potassium channels. NO was found to also cause a depolarization in B 19 neurons in situ, but only after NO synthase activity in buccal ganglia had been blocked. The results suggest that NO acts as a critica...|$|R
40|$|Many feeding {{behaviours}} are {{the result}} of stereotyped, organized sequences of motor patterns. These patterns {{have been the subject of}} neuroethological studies, such as electrophysiological characterization of neurons governing prey capture in toads. However, technical limitations have prevented detailed study of the functional role of these neurons, a common problem for vertebrate organisms. Complexities involved in studies of whole-animal behaviour can be resolved in Drosophila, in which remote activation of brain cells by genetic means enables us to examine the nervous system in freely moving animals to identify neurons that govern a specific behaviour, and then to repeatedly target and manipulate these neurons to characterize their function. Here we show neurons that generate the <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> program in Drosophila. We carried out an unbiased screen using remote neuronal activation and identified a critical pair of brain cells that induces the entire feeding sequence when activated. These 2 ̆ 7 feeding neurons 2 ̆ 7 (here abbreviated to Fdg neurons for brevity) are also essential for normal feeding as their suppression or ablation eliminates sugar-induced feeding behaviour. Activation of a single Fdg neuron induces asymmetric feeding behaviour and ablation of a single Fdg neuron distorts the sugar-induced feeding behaviour to become asymmetric, indicating the direct role of these neurons in shaping motor-program execution. Furthermore, recording neuronal activity and calcium imaging simultaneously during feeding behaviour reveals that the Fdg neurons respond to food presentation, but only in starved flies. Our results demonstrate that Fdg neurons operate firmly within the sensorimotor watershed, downstream of sensory and metabolic cues and at the top of the <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> hierarchy, to execute the decision to feed...|$|R

40|$|We use a {{multidisciplinary}} approach to identify, map, and characterize the bioactivity of modulatory neuropeptides in the circuitry that generates feeding behavior in Aplysia. Matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of the cerebral–buccal connective (CBC), a nerve containing axons of many interneurons that control feeding behavior of Aplysia, {{was used to}} identify neuropeptides that may participate in generation and shaping of <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> programs. Using this functionally oriented search, we identified a novel family of peptides that we call the feeding circuitactivating peptides (FCAPs). Two peptides with masses identical to those observed in the CBCs (molecular weight 1387 and 1433) were purified from buccal ganglia and partially sequenced using mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequence was then used to clone the FCAP precursor, which encode...|$|R
