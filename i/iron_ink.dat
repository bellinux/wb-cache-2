New material details the step-by-step investigations of specific cases—the diary of Jack the Ripper (fake), the Bondwoman's Narrative (date authenticated, author unknown), Lincoln's Lost Gettysburg Address (fake), and An Outlaw's Scribblings (fake). Nickell described a typical analysis: I decided to test the brown ink of the [...] "Bonney" [...] writing on page 10 of the album, lifting a sample onto chromatography paper dampened with distilled water. It transferred surprisingly easily (and thus suspiciously) and tested negative for iron (using hydrochloric acid digestion followed by potassium ferrocyanide reagent). The ink thus had {{the characteristics of a}} brown-colored ink and not a black-colored ink that had turned brown with age through oxidation. The availability of a brown-colored ink in 1881—especially on the western frontier—seems very unlikely. It could well be that the forger used brown ink to avoid the difficulty of having to artificially age an <b>iron</b> <b>ink</b> and thus transform it from black to brown.|$|E

Second, this study is one of materials, exploring the components of <b>iron</b> gall <b>ink</b> in different recipes, and how these components react to artificial aging through heat, humidity, sunlight, and chemical treatments. Paper and ink samples were aged using these methods, then analyzed with a microscope, ultraviolet light, and ambient light. The ink sample which displayed the fewest signs of being aged artificially was applied to non-collections material in an attempt to create a “fake ” forgery. This study is not one on forging the content of a document.

50|$|Traditional <b>iron</b> gall <b>inks</b> {{intended}} for dip pens are {{not suitable for}} fountain pens that operate {{on the principle of}} capillary action.

50|$|<b>Iron</b> gall <b>ink</b> (also {{known as}} <b>iron</b> gall nut <b>ink,</b> oak gall ink, and common ink) is a purple-black or brown-black <b>ink</b> made from <b>iron</b> salts and tannic acids from {{vegetable}} sources.

50|$|<b>Iron</b> gall <b>inks</b> became {{prominent}} in the early 12th century; they were used for centuries and were widely {{thought to be the}} best type of <b>ink.</b> However, <b>iron</b> gall <b>ink</b> is corrosive and damages the paper it is written on (Waters 1940). Items containing this ink can become brittle and the writing fades to brown. The original scores of Johann Sebastian Bach are threatened by the destructive properties of <b>iron</b> gall <b>ink.</b> The majority of his works are held by the German State Library, and about 25% of those are in advanced stages of decay (American Libraries 2000). The rate at which the writing fades is based on several factors, such as proportions of ink ingredients, amount deposited on the paper, and paper composition (Barrow 1972:16). Corrosion is caused by acid catalysed hydrolysis and iron(II)-catalysed oxidation of cellulose (Rouchon-Quillet 2004:389).|$|R

50|$|These modern <b>iron</b> gall <b>inks</b> {{contain a}} small amount of ferrogallic {{compounds}} and {{are also more likely to}} have a formulation which is stoichiometrically optimized. Historical inks often contained excess acid which was not consumed in the oxidation of the ferro gallic compounds. Modern formulations also tend to use hydrochloric acid whereas many historical inks used sulfuric acid. Hydrochloric acid is a gas in solution, which will evaporate. As a result, modern fountain pen <b>iron</b> gall <b>inks</b> are less likely to damage paper than historical inks and are gentler for the inside of a fountain pen, but can still cause problems if left in a pen for a long period. Manufacturers or resellers of modern <b>iron</b> gall <b>inks</b> intended for fountain pens sometimes advise a more thorough than usual cleaning regimen - which requires the ink to be flushed out regularly with water - to avoid clogging or corrosion on delicate pen parts. For more thoroughly cleaning <b>iron</b> gall <b>ink</b> out of a fountain pen, sequential flushes of the pen with water, diluted vinegar or citric acid (to flush out residual iron gall compounds), water, diluted ammonia (if needed to flush out residual color dye stains), then finally water are often recommended.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{recipes for}} oak gall ink come from Pliny the Elder, and are vague at best. Many famous and important manuscripts {{have been written}} using ferrous oak gall ink, including the Codex Sinaiticus, the oldest, most complete Bible currently known to exist, thought to be written {{in the middle of}} the fourth century. Due to the ease of making <b>iron</b> gall <b>ink</b> and its quality of permanence and water resistance this ink became the favored one for scribes in the European corridor as well as around the Mediterranean Sea. Surviving manuscripts from the Middle Ages as well as the Renaissance bear this out as the vast majority are written using <b>iron</b> gall <b>ink,</b> the balance being written using lamp black or carbon black inks. Laws were enacted in Great Britain and France specifying the content of <b>iron</b> gall <b>ink</b> for all royal and legal records to ensure permanence in this time period as well.|$|R
5000|$|While a very {{effective}} ink, the formula was less than ideal. <b>Iron</b> gall <b>ink</b> is acidic ranging from roughly equivalent to a lemon (pH ≈ 2) {{to that of a}} cup of black coffee (pH ≈ 5). In chemistry, pH {{is a measure of the}} activity of the (solvated) hydrogen ion, where a lower pH level indicates a more acidic solution. For this reason some makers of <b>iron</b> gall <b>ink</b> used crushed egg shells (which contain calcium carbonate (CaCO3)) to temper the ink solution acidity, bringing it closer to a neutral pH (pH = 7) value. Depending on the writing surface being used <b>iron</b> gall <b>ink</b> can have unsightly [...] "ghost writing" [...] on the obverse face of the writing surface (most commonly parchment or paper). Also any excess of ferrous ions remaining in the ink over years, decades, and centuries, could create a rusty halo around the marks and ultimately it might eat holes through the surface it was on.|$|R

40|$|<b>Iron</b> gall <b>inks</b> are of {{extraordinary}} historical significance considering their widespread use {{for over a}} millennium. Due to their corrosiveness, which {{is a consequence of}} their acidity and content of transition metals, <b>iron</b> gall <b>inks</b> accelerate the degradation of the writing or drawing support, which in this study is rag paper. Characterisation of acidity (pH) and degree of polymerisation (DP) of cellulose in paper is thus of high interest as it enables the estimation of material stability and assessment of risks associated with its handling. Based on a well-characterised set of samples with <b>iron</b> gall <b>ink</b> from the 18 th and 19 th centuries, we developed a near infrared spectroscopic method with partial least squares calibration for non-destructive determination of pH and DP of both inked areas and paper. Using this method, 27 18 th and 19 th century <b>iron</b> gall <b>ink</b> drawings from the British Museum collection were analysed and in all cases, inked areas {{turned out to be more}} acidic and degraded than the surrounding paper. Based on the obtained DP data, we were able to estimate the time needed for the inked areas to degrade to the point when they become at risk of damage due to handling. Using the average uncertainty of the calculated lifetime, we propose a quantitative stability classification method which could contribute to the curatorial and conservation decision-making process...|$|R
30|$|Due to the dark-brown, {{almost black}} {{color of the}} text ink it is {{possible}} that the <b>iron</b> gall <b>ink</b> is mixed with carbon black. However, by the methods XRF and rFTIR it is not possible to detect this kind of writing material—carbon (C) cannot be detected by XRF in air and it does not absorb mid infrared radiation. In general, Raman spectrometry would allow the identification of carbon black, but the interference with the bands of the support material (parchment) did not yield clear results. Therefore, a possible mixture of <b>iron</b> gall <b>ink</b> with carbon black cannot be excluded.|$|R
30|$|The {{relation}} between metallic elements and iron, in fact, {{is the most}} important parameter for the characterization of iron dye chemical composition [11].

Moreover, ratios among the components are not explicitly quoted in ancient recipes and thus the final result can change a lot, the dye being a homemade product. For these reasons, the ratio between iron and other metals is often used to discriminate different <b>iron</b> <b>inks</b> [12].|$|R
