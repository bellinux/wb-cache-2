She escaped from the crossfire by crossing ahead of San Francisco and passing to the disengaged side of Scott's column. Duncan—still engaged in her solitary torpedo attack on the Japanese formation—was also hit by gunfire <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> set afire, and looped away in her own effort to escape the crossfire.|$|E
5|$|Only one Horsa with {{a platoon}} of {{infantry}} from the Staffords landed near the bridge. Its commander, Lieutenant Withers, divided his men into two groups, one of which swam across the river and took up position on the opposite bank. Thereafter the bridge was captured following a simultaneous assault <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides.</b> The Italian defenders from the 120th Coastal Infantry Regiment abandoned their pillboxes on the north bank.|$|E
5|$|The French van, pounded by British fire <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> {{had begun}} to surrender, and the victorious British ships {{continued}} to move down the line, bringing Brueys's 118-gun flagship Orient under constant heavy fire. Orient caught fire under this bombardment, and later exploded. Nelson briefly came on deck to direct the battle, but returned to the surgeon after watching the destruction of Orient.|$|E

Treatment of the wounded continued all day, and by 22:00 the surgeons had carried out 21 surgical operations and were looking after 62 British and 29 German or Italian patients.

5|$|For {{ten minutes}} after the {{explosion}} there was no firing; sailors <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> were either too shocked by the blast or desperately extinguishing fires aboard their own ships to continue the fight. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of Orient. At 22:10, Franklin restarted the engagement by firing on Swiftsure. Isolated and battered, Blanquet's ship was soon dismasted and the admiral, suffering a severe head wound, was forced to surrender by the combined firepower of Swiftsure and Defence. More than half of Franklins crew had been killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|Further {{periods of}} {{intensified}} anti-German {{feeling in the}} Rhodesias followed the execution by the Germans of the British nurse Edith Cavell in Belgium in October 1915 ("the Crowning Crime", the Bulawayo Chronicle called it), the escalation of bombing raids by German Zeppelins on British cities during 1917, and the British reportage the same year of the Kadaververwertungsanstalt atrocity story—that the Germans supposedly rendered down battlefield corpses <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> to make products such as nitroglycerine and lubricants.|$|E

Peaceful behavior was not ubiquitous; fighting continued in some sectors, while in others the sides settled on little more than arrangements to recover bodies.|$|E

In February 1690, the French began peace negotiations with the Iroquois. The French returned captured natives {{in exchange for the}} beginnings of peace talks. Through the 1690s, there were no major French or native raids and, even against the will of the English, peace talks continued. This time of relative peace eventually led to the Montreal Treaty of 1701, by which the Iroquois promised to remain neutral in case of war between the French and English.|$|E
