5|$|Ao filed {{a motion}} before the Court of Appeal to un-freeze some of his {{personal}} bank accounts, {{on the grounds that}} those accounts were supposedly not linked to the corruption case, and were the actual accounts for receiving <b>his</b> <b>salary.</b> The motion was denied on 26 September 2008: according to the verdict of his corruption trial, all his money and personal possessions, even if purchased legally, now belonged to Macau.|$|E

50|$|Chokichi {{worked at}} the canning factory {{introduced}} by Isamu Okada (Nenji Kobayashi) who is a relative man of Nonaka, but he resigned that and worked various farmlands as a day laborer during seven years in order to send <b>his</b> <b>salaries</b> to <b>his</b> family living in Shimane.|$|R
5|$|Havlat {{was given}} a five-minute major penalty for {{attempting}} to injure Recchi, along with a game misconduct penalty. He was later given a two-game suspension by the NHL due to the incident.

5|$|Synagogue dues were {{collected}} by the shamash (the equivalent of a sexton or beadle), who augmented <b>his</b> <b>salary</b> by working as a glazier and running a small food concession stand in the vestibule. There mourners who came to recite kaddish could purchase a piece of sponge cake and small glass of brandy for ten cents (today $0).|$|E
5|$|Yaphet Kotto {{was offered}} the role of Parker along with lucrative offers from two other productions. Although his agent advised him to decline the role in Alien because <b>his</b> <b>salary</b> was not specified, Kotto {{accepted}} the role.

5|$|According to France Football, Messi was the world's highest-paid footballer {{for five}} years out of six between 2009 and 2014; {{he was the first}} player to exceed the €40million benchmark, with {{earnings}} of €41million in 2013, and the €50–€60million points, with income of €65million in 2014. In 2016, Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes (after Cristiano Ronaldo) with income of $81.4 million from <b>his</b> <b>salary</b> and endorsements in 2015–16. Since 2008, he has been Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8million to €13million over the next five years. His current salary of €20million net (€36million before taxes), established in 2014, is the highest ever in the sport. In addition to <b>his</b> <b>salary</b> and multimillion-euro bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010. His main sponsor since 2006 is the sportswear company Adidas. As Barça's leading youth prospect, he had been signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court. Over time, Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser; from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, he became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of boots, the Adidas Messi.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, Hawk {{was fined}} $10,000 by the NFL for making an obscene gesture {{during a game}} against the St. Louis Rams. Hawk was an {{alternate}} for the Pro Bowl. In March 2013, Hawk restructured his contract, reducing <b>his</b> 2013 <b>salary</b> from $5.45 million to $3.6 million. <b>His</b> 2014 <b>salary</b> was reduced by $2.5 million and <b>his</b> 2015 <b>salary</b> was reduced by nearly $3 million. All told, the total value of the remaining three years on Hawk's deal is reduced by about $7 million ($17.85 million to $10.6 million), providing the Packers with more cap space.|$|R

50|$|Francesco Caio has {{received}} criticism for <b>his</b> high <b>salary.</b> <b>His</b> tenure {{has been characterized}} by actions to promote legality in the company. In 2015, Caio was investigated for violating laws concerning safe working conditions in a small local post office.|$|R
5|$|Another of Harrison's goals was {{to raise}} {{the morale of the}} {{workforce}} and locomotive engineers; crews were assigned to the same locomotives, and senior engineers were allowed to paint their names on their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced <b>his</b> <b>salary</b> by 20percent, but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff, with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales. Other efforts to improve morale included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Seward {{incurred}} considerable {{personal debt}} {{not only because}} he had to live beyond <b>his</b> <b>salary</b> to maintain the lifestyle expected of the office, but also because he could not pay down his obligation from the land company purchase. At the time he left office, he owed $200,000. Returning to Auburn, he absorbed himself in a profitable law practice. He did not abandon politics, and received former president Adams at the Seward family home in 1843.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the rank pyramid were the common soldiers: pedes (infantryman) and eques (cavalryman). Unlike his 2nd-century counterpart, the 4th-century soldier's food and {{equipment}} was not deducted from <b>his</b> <b>salary</b> (stipendium), but was provided free. This is because the stipendium, paid in debased silver denarii, was under Diocletian worth far less than in the 2nd century. It lost its residual value under Constantine and ceased to be paid regularly in mid-4th century.|$|E

50|$|His {{next job}} {{took him to}} Spain, as he participated in the 1992 Cuban-Spaniard {{production}} Me Alquilo Para Soñar. In 1993, Gattorno proceeded to work on another Cuban film, Sueño Tropical. Gattorno was by then a well-known actor in Cuba. <b>His</b> <b>salaries,</b> however, were comparatively small compared to those of well known actors in other Latin American countries.|$|R

5|$|At {{the close}} of the war, having drawn no part of <b>his</b> <b>salary,</b> and from his great skill as a surgeon having endeared himself to the Virginians, in {{settling}} up his accounts he was presented with a land warrant, to be located in lands selected in Kentucky, leaving a blank within the warrant for the number of acres to filled by Dr Hinde himself. The blank was filled with twenty thousand, and placed in the hands of Patrick Henry to select and locate the lands.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1899, Warner was {{appointed}} the school's athletic director and <b>his</b> <b>salary</b> more than doubled. A track-and-field program was started that year. Warner knew little about the sport; to prepare as coach he bought every book available and consulted Jack Moakley and Mike Murphy, two of the era's leading head coaches. The program was successful; running was a Native American tradition, and students from the Southwest were known for their stamina in long-distance races.|$|E
5|$|His {{enthusiasm for}} {{teaching}} at the university ebbed in his final years there. He was also perturbed {{by an increase in}} religious enthusiasm on campus and a temperance movement, which he mildly protested. Tucker zealously defended higher salaries for more tenured professors, and he was enraged when the University reduced his annual salary from $1500 to $1000. Having produced documentation proving that Jefferson had intended <b>his</b> <b>salary</b> be guaranteed for life, he convinced the university to reinstate his original salary.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, back in England, Brock's brother William faced {{financial}} difficulties, as {{the bank}} {{in which he was}} a senior partner failed. Isaac's commissions had been purchased with a loan entered into the bank's books by his brother, and the Brocks faced a demand for payment. Isaac could not meet the £3000 debt, but made over the whole of <b>his</b> <b>salary</b> to his brother Irving, to be used for whatever was considered most critical: his commission debt or the family's other bills.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen did {{not give}} up the violin during his time with the battalion, {{continuing}} to play it when he went home to perform at dances with his father.

In this role he donated <b>his</b> <b>salaries</b> and allowances to the government.|$|R
