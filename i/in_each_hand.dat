5|$|Haynes asked Fitch {{to observe}} the ailerons through the {{passenger}} cabin windows to see if control inputs were having any effect. Fitch reported back that the ailerons were not moving at all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns {{for the remainder of}} the flight, hoping for at least some effect. Haynes then asked Fitch to take over control of the throttles so that Haynes could concentrate on his control column. With one throttle <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>hand,</b> Fitch was able to mitigate the phugoid cycle and make rough steering adjustments.|$|E
5|$|Related to weapon {{dances and}} war dances is {{the dance of}} the hunt. A very early {{reference}} to a weapon dance of the hunt {{comes in the form}} of a rock engraving at Çatal Höyük, the large neolithic settlement in south-central Anatolia. It depicts a hunting ritual involving dancers holding their bows; one figure has a bow <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>hand,</b> two perform artistic leaps and another holds a horn-shaped stick and is striking a frame drum.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} mallets {{used by the}} player could also vary as well. For most occasions, only one mallet is used but for other techniques, the player could use two mallets, one <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>hand.</b> An even more {{interesting}} technique uses only one balu but requires the player to play the agung in reverse order of pitches. Called patuy, this technique and the one with two mallets are normally reserved only for competition and exhibition instances.|$|E

5|$|The {{long jump}} {{is one of}} the oldest track and field events, having its roots as one of the events within the ancient Greek pentathlon contest. The athletes would take a short run up and jump into an area of dug up earth, with the winner being the one who jumped farthest. Small weights (Halteres) were held <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>hand</b> during the jump then swung back and dropped near the end to gain extra {{momentum}} and distance. The modern long jump, standardised in England and the United States around 1860, bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used. Athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit. The athletes must jump before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete's body.|$|E
