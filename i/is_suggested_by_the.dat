5|$|Finally, {{yet another}} brother, {{possibly}} younger than Nyuserre {{has also been}} proposed: Iryenre, a prince Iry-pat whose relationship <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that his funerary cult was associated with that of his mother, both having {{taken place in the}} temple of Khentkaus II.|$|E
5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.|$|E
5|$|From {{the overall}} stock of an {{estimated}} 458 million workers, 394million (86%) operate in the unorganised sector (of which 63% are self-employed) mostly as informal workers. There is a strong relationship between the quality of employment and social and poverty characteristics. The relative growth of informal employment was more rapid within the organised rather than the unorganised sector. This informalisation is also related to the flexibilisation of employment in the organised sector that <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> increasing use of contract labour by employers in order to benefit from more flexible labour practices.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known turtles {{are from}} fossils in the Upper Triassic. These fossils are nearly indistinguishable from modern turtles anatomically. In these early fossils (mostly {{of the genus}} Proganochelys), the teeth have already been lost, and a keratin beak <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mandibles. Important differences between Proganochelys and modern turtles are {{the presence of the}} palatal teeth (lost in modern species), the inability to retract the head within the shell, and the lack of a trochlear pulley in the jaw closing anatomy.|$|E
5|$|Making {{contemporary}} political points {{in this way}} through reinterpretation of distant historical episodes was now common. In 17th century France, {{the fall of the}} powerful Cardinal Mazarin was celebrated in a political pamphlet that also drew parallels with the career of Sejanus, L'Ambitieux ou le portraict d'Aelius Sejanus en la personne du Cardinal Mazarin (Paris, 1642). In England other royal favourites were seen in these terms too. George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, is the target of an anonymous manuscript Roman tragedy, The Emperor’s Favourite. The prudent need for anonymity, <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arrest of Sir John Eliot, who was sent to the Tower of London for his outspoken criticism of the Duke in the 1626 parliament, comparing him to Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{apparently}} {{controlled the}} Kingdom of Lindsey, given {{the evidence of}} a story told by Bede regarding the moving of Oswald's bones to a monastery there; Bede says that the monks rejected the bones initially because Oswald had ruled over them as a foreign king. To the north, {{it may have been}} Oswald who conquered the Gododdin. Irish annals record the siege of Edinburgh, thought to have been the royal stronghold of the Gododdin, in 638, and this seems to mark the end of the kingdom; that this siege was undertaken by Oswald <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> apparent control of the area by his brother Oswiu in the 650s.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{interpretation of}} potbelly monuments {{is that they}} were representations of rulership. This <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> body position represented in the sculptures, the type of adornment sometimes depicted on them, the pedestals on which they sometimes sit and the ceremonial sites where they are found as well as their locations within such sites. The potbelly body position is symbolic of rulership; the figures are seated cross-legged and with the arms wrapping the body or holding an object. Twenty-five potbelly monuments are known to display a collar as neck jewellery, again suggestive of rulership. Pedestal bases are known from potbelly sculptures from Sin Cabezas, Antigua Guatemala, Kaminaljuyu, Santa Cruz del Quiché, Takalik Abaj, Tikal, Ujuxte, El Balsamo, Los Cerritos and La Nueva in Guatemala, Chalchuapa in El Salvador, and Copán in Honduras. This represents 42% of sites with potbelly sculptures. If pedestals are equivalent to thrones then Bilbao Monument 58 is also relevant, which was found associated with a four-legged stone altar or throne and may originally have been positioned on top of it.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the archaea evolved from gram-positive bacteria in response to antibiotic selection pressure. This <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> observation that archaea are resistant {{to a wide variety}} of antibiotics that are primarily produced by gram-positive bacteria, and that these antibiotics primarily act on the genes that distinguish archaea from bacteria. The proposal is that the selective pressure towards resistance generated by the gram-positive antibiotics was eventually sufficient to cause extensive changes in many of the antibiotics' target genes, and that these strains represented the common ancestors of present-day Archaea. The evolution of Archaea in response to antibiotic selection, or any other competitive selective pressure, could also explain their adaptation to extreme environments (such as high temperature or acidity) as the result of a search for unoccupied niches to escape from antibiotic-producing organisms; Cavalier-Smith has made a similar suggestion. This proposal is also supported by other work investigating protein structural relationships and studies that suggest that gram-positive bacteria may constitute the earliest branching lineages within the prokaryotes.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Megalosaurus is poorly known. The {{discovered}} skull elements are generally rather large {{in relation to}} the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that Megalosaurus had an uncommonly large head. The praemaxilla is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that the front branch of the maxilla was short. In the depression around the antorbital fenestra to the front, a smaller non-piercing hollowing can be seen that is probably homologous to the fenestra maxillaris. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a crown length up to seven centimetres. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The cutting edges bear eighteen to twenty denticula per centimetre. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13–14/13–14. The jugal bone is pneumatised, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably hollowed out by an outgrowth of an air sac in the nasal bone. Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate autapomorphy.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "aulacogen" [...] {{is derived}} from the Greek aulax (furrow) and <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Soviet {{geologist}} Nikolay Shatsky in 1946.|$|R
25|$|A {{connection}} between Setnakhte's successors and the preceding Nineteenth Dynasty <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that one}} of Ramesses II's children also bore this name and that similar names are shared by Setnakhte's descendants such as Ramesses, Amun-her-khepshef, Seth-her-khepshef and Monthu-her-khepshef.|$|E
25|$|Chasmosaurus shared its habitat, {{the east}} coast of Laramidia, with {{successive}} species of Centrosaurus. A certain niche partitioning <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that Chasmosaurus had a longer snout and jaws and might have been more selective about the plants it ate.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{yet another}} brother, {{possibly}} younger than both Neferefre and Nyuserre {{has also been}} proposed: Iryenre, a prince Iry-pat whose filiation <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that his funerary cult was associated with that of his mother, both having {{taken place in the}} temple of Khentkaus II.|$|E

25|$|Poseidonia {{might have}} had a major share in a new {{foundation}} of Sybaris, which lasted from 452/1 BC until 446/5BC. This <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> great resemblance of the coins of Sybaris to those of Poseidonia during this period. Possibly a treaty of friendship between Sybaris, its allies, and the Serdaioi (an unknown people) dates to this new foundation, because Poseidonia was the guarantor of this treaty.|$|E
25|$|Infants usually {{produce their}} first word around 12 –14 months of age. First words are simple in {{structure}} and contain the same sounds {{that were used}} in late babbling. The lexical items they produce are probably stored as whole words rather than as individual segments that get put together online when uttering them. This <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that infants at this age may produce the same sounds differently in different words.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{viewpoint}} {{that some}} Americans {{have come to}} see the documents of the Constitution, along with the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, as being a cornerstone of a type of civil religion. This <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> prominent display of the Constitution, along with the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, in massive, bronze-framed, bulletproof, moisture-controlled glass containers vacuum-sealed in a rotunda by day and in multi-ton bomb-proof vaults by night at the National Archives Building.|$|E

25|$|Another {{possible}} {{design for}} the roof <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> slightly earlier Trajan's Column, where watchtowers are shown with hipped (or pyramidal) roofs. In this design, a balcony is shown below the roof, acting as the observation platform. To maintain the equivalent viewing height as the flat roofed design, this design would necessitate a slightly higher tower. Physical evidence supporting this design {{comes in the form}} of both roof tiles fragments in a few turrets, and slates in some others.|$|E
25|$|Twenty or so Berber {{languages}} (also called Tamazight) are {{spoken in}} North Africa. Berber speakers were once predominant over all this large area, {{but as a}} result of Arabization and later local migrations, today Berber languages are reduced to several large regions (in Morocco, Algeria, and the central Sahara) or remain as smaller language islands. Several linguists characterize the Berber spoken as one language with many dialect variations, spread out in discrete regions, without ongoing standardization. The Berber languages may be classified as follows (with some more widely known languages or language groups shown in italics). Ethnic historical correspondence <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> designation |Tribe|.|$|E
25|$|Judge's Hill (NS 519 386) – Barony of Loudoun. Shown {{on the old}} OS maps {{under this}} name. A {{possible}} man made 'Moot Hill' near to the old Loudoun Castle, sometimes called Arclowdun, standing on the Hag Burn. Judge's Hill stands close to the Hag or Bowhill Burn. This {{may well be the}} Justice hill for the Campbell's of Earl's of Loudoun. A Gallows Hill is situated near {{the upper reaches of the}} Burn Anne above Shinny Hill. Additional evidence <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> name 'Muttonhole Strip' that lies nearby and may derive from 'Mort-toun-hole', the place where women were drowned when sentenced by a barony court.|$|E
