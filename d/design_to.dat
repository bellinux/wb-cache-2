5|$|Despite {{the loss}} of the Patrie, the Lebaudy Brothers went on to {{complete}} a sister-ship to the Patrie, the République, for the French Army.

5|$|During the Korean War, USAF {{fighter pilots}} were outclassed by MiG-equipped Soviet pilots.

5|$|Initially, Gasparro {{expected}} that Congress would authorize his soaring eagle reverse <b>design</b> <b>to</b> accompany the Susan B. Anthony obverse.

The comon process monitors were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> test resistivity, opens and shorts, contact resistance and capacitance. The photolithograPhic monitors were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> test image resolution and alignment. Process specific discrete devices were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> test parainetrics and leakage currents.

5|$|A film {{adaptation}} of Dreamgirls, starring Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson, {{was released by}} DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures in December 2006. The film contains more overt references to Motown and the Supremes than does the play that inspired it: for example, in the film, many of the Dreams' album covers are identical in <b>design</b> <b>to</b> Supremes album covers, and the Dreams themselves hail from Detroit – not Chicago, as do their Broadway counterparts.|$|E
5|$|A {{handful of}} {{rooms in the}} modern State Apartments reflect either 18th-century or Victorian Gothic design. The State Dining Room, for example, whose current design {{originates}} from the 1850s but which was badly damaged during the 1992 fire, is restored to its appearance in the 1920s, before the removal {{of some of the}} gilded features on the pilasters. Anthony Salvin's Grand Staircase is also of mid-Victorian design in the Gothic style, rising to a double-height hall lit by an older 18th-century Gothic vaulted lantern tower called the Grand Vestibule, designed by James Wyatt and executed by Francis Bernasconi. The staircase has been criticised by historian John Robinson as being a distinctly inferior <b>design</b> <b>to</b> the earlier staircases built on the same site by both Wyatt and May.|$|E
5|$|A new wing {{was added}} in early 1980 to provide {{additional}} space for the arts, with a large room for orchestra and music and another for studio art. Filling in the previously open {{east side of the}} courtyard, the design is nearly identical in <b>design</b> <b>to</b> the original school, built of red and white-washed brick with a cloister on the courtyard side. The Gatehouse, which was built in 1929 and had served as the headmaster's residence, was remodeled to house the early childhood program in 1988.|$|E

5|$|An era {{came to an}} end in 1668 {{with two}} events: Davenant died suddenly, leaving a messy {{ownership}} situation for the Duke's Company, and Pepys' eyesight forced him to stop keeping a diary. Thomas Betterton, though formally a minority shareholder, continued to run the Duke's Company, and, in the spirit of Davenant, commissioned the most elaborate of the Restoration playhouses, the theatre at Dorset Garden (or Dorset Gardens), with a flat for himself on top. Although the Dorset Garden Theatre quickly became a famous and glamorous venue, very little is concretely known about the building and outfitting of it: a vague and undocumented tradition ascribes its <b>design</b> <b>to</b> Christopher Wren. The absence of Pepys' record means that performance data for the next decades are only patchily known.|$|E
5|$|As work on {{the project}} has progressed, {{information}} has been published {{on a number of}} design versions, including A4, C1, C2, and D1. Testing of the key technologies was successfully completed in November 2012, allowing Skylon's <b>design</b> <b>to</b> advance from its research phase to a development phase. An engine test facility is being built at Westcott and if all goes to plan, the first ground-based engine tests could happen in 2020, and Skylon could be performing unmanned test flights by 2025.|$|E
