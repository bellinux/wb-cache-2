25|$|An {{efficiently}} insulated tank can retain {{stored heat}} for days, reducing fuel costs. Hot water tanks {{may have a}} built-in gas or oil burner system, electric <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters.</b> Some types use an external heat exchanger such as a central heating system, or heated water from another energy source. The most typical, in the domestic context, is a fossil-fuel burner, electric immersion elements, or a district heating scheme.|$|E
25|$|Electrical <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters</b> may heat water {{immediately}} {{adjacent to}} the heating element high enough to promote the formation of scale, commonly calcium carbonate, in hard water areas. This accumulates on the element, and over time, as the element expands and contracts through its heating cycle, the scale cracks off and drops {{to the bottom of}} the tank, progressively filling up the tank. This reduces the tank's capacity and, where the immersion heater is secondary to the heating of the water by a coil fed from a gas or oil-fired boiler, can reduce the efficiency of the primary heating source by covering that other coil and in turn reducing its efficiency. Regular flushing-out of accumulated sediment can reduce this problem.|$|E

50|$|The popular 4-way fusebox {{normally}} had two {{lighting and}} two socket circuits, with heavy or sustained loads such as <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> and oven on a socket circuit.

40|$|In this study, an {{electrical}} <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> {{mounted on a}} water tank has been investigated. Themain aim was to reduce heat transfer and to utilize the maximum energy available from heater toheat the water. To observe the effects of essential geometrical and operating parameters on thesystem performance, different computational test cases were run for three different designs. In the first case of simulation, the <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> of existing design mounted on a water tankhas been analyzed. The cold-water tank with inlet and outlet and given appropriate boundaryconditions was used to see the temperature contours inside the water tank and temperature of theimmersion layer itself. In the second case, an insulation plate has been introduced in the <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> head in orderto reduce heat loss by considering the possible heat leakage through the gap inside the heaterhead by radiation. In the third case, an insulation ring has been introduced in the <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> head as asubstitute for the insulation plate which has the same aim as second case. The results obtained from the CFD simulation shows the thermal performance of immersionheater in a water tank for three different cases. The results are helpful in optimizing both heatingelement and <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> by introducing different changes to optimize the design. It showsthat the redesigned <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> and storage tank can provide improved working conditions. Also, at early design stages, CFD simulations {{could be used as}} an effective tool to optimizethermal storage tank parameters, so it may add value to the storage tank and immersion heaterperformance and efficiency, by optimizing the whole thermal heating system design and size. Different materials and geometry design are tested giving the minimum heat losses from thesystem and uniform temperature distribution in the water heater...|$|R
25|$|Domestic <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters,</b> usually {{rated at}} 3 kilowatts {{and on a}} 1.5-inch British Standard Pipe screwplug in the UK, run on the normal {{domestic}} electricity supply, but users may also {{take advantage of a}} cheaper, off-peak electricity tariff such as Economy 7 (in the UK). In a typical off-peak installation, a lower immersion heater is connected to the separately switched off-peak heating circuit and an upper heater is connected to the normal circuit via its own switch. The consumer then has the option to top up the available hot water supply at any time, rather than waiting for the cheaper supply to turn on (typically after midnight). A poorly insulated hot water cylinder will increase running costs because a consumer must pay for electricity used to replace lost heat.|$|E
25|$|Most meters using Economy 7 {{switch the}} entire {{electricity}} {{supply to the}} cheaper rate during the 7 hour night time period, not just the storage heater circuit. The downside {{of this is that}} the daytime rate per kWh is significantly higher, and that standing charges are sometimes higher. For example, as of July 2017, normal ("single rate") electricity costs 17.14p per kWh in the London region on the standard default tariff for EDF Energy (the post-privatisation incumbent electricity supplier in London), with a standing charge of 18.90p per day. The equivalent Economy 7 costs are 21.34p per kWh during the peak usage period with 7.83p per kWh during the off-peak usage period, and a standing charge of 18.90p per day. Timer switches installed on washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers and <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters</b> may be set so that they only switch on during the off-peak usage period.|$|E

2500|$|An {{immersion}} heater has an electrical {{resistance heating element}} encased in a tube and directly placed in the water (or other fluid) to be heated. The {{immersion heater}} may be placed in an insulated hot water tank. [...] A temperature sensor within the tank triggers a thermostat to control {{the temperature of the}} water.

2500|$|Radio-activated {{switching}} {{is common}} in the UK, with a nightly data signal sent within the longwave carrier of BBC Radio 4, 198kHz. [...] The time of off-peak charging is usually seven hours between midnight and 7:00am GMT/BST, and this is designed to power storage heaters and <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters.</b> In the UK, such tariffs are typically branded Economy 7, White Meter or Dual-Rate. The popularity of such tariffs has declined in recent years, {{at least in the}} domestic market, because of the (perceived or real) deficiencies of storage heaters and the comparatively much low cost of natural gas per kWh (typically a factor of 3-5 times lower). Nevertheless, a sizeable number of properties do not have the option of gas, with many in rural areas being outside the gas supply network, and others being expensive upfront to upgrade to a radiator system.|$|E

50|$|Where hot-water {{space heating}} boilers are installed, {{domestic}} hot water cylinders are usually heated indirectly by primary water from the boiler, or by an electric <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> (often as backup to the boiler).

50|$|In {{traditional}} plumbing in the UK, the space-heating boiler {{is set up}} to heat {{a separate}} hot water cylinder or water heater for potable hot water.

Heat from the space-heating boiler is transferred to the water heater vessel/container {{by means of a}} heat exchanger, and the boiler operates at a higher temperature than the potable hot water supply.

40|$|The {{mass flow}} {{characteristics}} of flashing Refrigerant- 22 {{from a small}} vessel were investigated. A flash boiling apparatus was designed and built. It was modeled after the flashing process encountered by the accumulator of air-source heat pump systems. Three small pyrex glass vessels were used to hold the refrigerant and allow for visualization studies of the flashing process. Baseline experiments were run varying initial pressure, initial refrigerant amount, orifice diameter, and vessel geometry. Three sets of experiments were run using two passive enhancement methods (the addition of steel balls {{and the addition of}} small amounts of oil) and one active enhancement method (the addition of an <b>immersion</b> <b>heater).</b> Furthermore, a lumped-parameter analytical model was developed from basic thermodynamic principles that predicted the rate of depressurization for the flashing refrigerant. The study showed that the initial refrigerant amount and the orifice size had the greatest influence on the mass flow and pressure characteristics during each sixty second test. The initial pressure and vessel volume had less of an impact under the conditions tested. Two of the enhancement methods consistently increased the amount of refrigerant flashed during the tests as compared to the baseline data for the same initial conditions. The addition a 1 cm layer of 3. 6 mm steel balls {{to the base of the}} vessel increased the amount flashed from 21 % to 81 % and the addition of the 215 -watt flat-spiral <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> the increased the amount flashed from 47 % to 111 %.
