40|$|To breed {{or not to}} breed: that is the {{question}} Decisions facing <b>hoopoe</b> <b>larks</b> in the Arabian desert In temperate areas, we tend to take it for granted that birds have an annual cycle that includes a breeding season each spring.

40|$|A common {{perception}} is that desert birds experience greater extremes of heat and aridity than their mammalian counterparts, in part, because birds do not use burrows as a refuge from the desert environment. We report observations of Dunn's Larks (Eremalauda dunni), Bar-tailed Desert Larks (Ammomanes cincturus), Black-crowned Finch Larks (Eremoprerix nigriceps), and <b>Hoopoe</b> <b>Larks</b> (Alaemon alaudipes) using burrows of the large herbivorous lizard Uromastyx aegypticus as thermal refugia during hot summer days in the Arabian Desert. Continuous recordings of shade air temperature (T-a), soil surface temperature (T-surface), burrow air temperature (Ta-burrow), and burrow substrate temperature (T-substrate) showed that T-surface exceeded 60 degrees C on most days. T-a typically exceeded 45 degrees C, whereas Ta-burrow was around 41 degrees C during midday.

40|$|Nest {{placement}} {{affects the}} risk of predation on both eggs and incubating parents and determines the microclimate for incubation, two functions that may be in conflict, especially in hot deserts. We studied the roles of microclimate and nest predation on nest site selection by <b>Hoopoe</b> <b>Larks</b> (Alaemon alaudipes) in the Arabian Desert. <b>Hoopoe</b> <b>Larks</b> build nests in three microsites: on the gravel plain away from vegetation, {{at the base of}} bushes, or above ground in bushes. Early in the breeding season, 70 % of nests were placed on the ground, but as the season progressed, nests in small bushes represented 77 % of total nests; nest cover increased from 5 % to 21 %. Daily survival rate of natural nests was 0. 82. Predation on eggs did not differ among nest sites, either for natural nests or in an experiment with artificial nests. Measurements of operative and egg temperatures showed that artificial nests on the gravel plain experience higher temperatures than those under and in bushes. Nest attendance totaled 77 % of daytime in nests under bushes and 81 % in nests in or on top of bushes, with the larger share of attendance contributed by females. However, during midday, when evaporative water requirements—estimated from temperature profiles at artificial nests—were 10 – 15 -fold higher than during early morning, males and females shared incubation duties almost equally. We hypothesize that <b>Hoopoe</b> <b>Larks</b> favor exposed nest sites to reduce predation risk to themselves as incubating parents, but as the season progresses, they select nest sites with more cover at the base of or within bushes because the thermal environment forces them to do so. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} physiological, demographic, {{and ecological}} variables of larks to gain insights into life history variation along an aridity gradient, incorporating phylogenetic relationships in analyses when appropriate. Quantifying field metabolic rate (FMR). and water influx rate (WIR) of parents feeding nestlings as measures of parental effort, {{we found that}} parental FMR and WIR of larks decreased with increasing aridity. Water and energy requirements of 6 - 8 d old nestlings were reduced in desert species. Nestling growth rate, clutch size, and number of clutches decreased with increasing aridity, and nest predation rates increased with increasing aridity. We combined FMR and WIR of parents and chicks, energy and water accumulated during growth, and brood size to establish energy and water budgets of parent-brood units. Parent-offspring energy budgets equaled 261 kJ/d for <b>Hoopoe</b> <b>Lark,</b> 164 kJ/d for Dunn's Lark, 388 kJ/d for Skylark, and 347 Old for Woodlark, a 27 % reduction in the desert species when taking into account mass differences. Family unit WIRs were 46. 6 g/d for <b>Hoopoe</b> <b>Lark,</b> 37. 3 g/d for Dunn's Lark, 101. 6 g/d for Skylark, and 83. 2 g/d for Woodlark. Parent-brood units of arid-zone species used 28 - 51 % less water per gram mass than species from mesic areas. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} decreasing food and water availability favor lower energy and water requirements of parents and young, reduced growth rates, and smaller clutch sizes with increasing aridity. The decrease in parental effort with increasing aridity might reflect a lower fitness value of a single brood for arid-zone species than for larks from mesic habitats, suggesting that the probability of adult survival is higher in arid than in mesic areas...|$|E
40|$|Because deserts are {{characterized}} by low food availability, high ambient temperature extremes, and absence of drinking water, one might expect that birds that live in these conditions exhibit a lower basal metabolic rate (BMR), reduced total evaporative water loss (TEWL), and greater {{ability to cope with}} high air temperatures than their mesic counterparts. To minimize confounding effects of phylogeny, we compared the physiological performance of four species of larks at ambient temperatures (T-a's) ranging from 0 degrees to 50 degreesC: hoopoe larks (Alaemon alaudipes) and Dunn's larks (Eremalauda dunni) live in hot and dry deserts, whereas skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and woodlarks (Lullula arborea) occur in temperate mesic areas. Mass-adjusted BMR and TEWL were indistinguishable between <b>hoopoe</b> <b>lark</b> and Dunn's lark and between skylark and woodlark. When grouping the data of the two desert larks in one set and the data of the two mesic larks in another, desert larks are shown to have 43 % lower BMR levels and 27 % lower TEWL values than the mesic species. Their body temperatures (T-b's) were 1. 1 degreesC lower, and the minimal dry heat transfer coefficients (h) were 26 % below values for the mesic larks. When T a exceeded T-b, the h of hoopoe larks and Dunn's larks was high and indistinguishable from h at 40 degreesC, in contrast to the prediction that h should be decreased to minimize heat gain through conductance, convection, or radiation from the environment when T-a exceeds T-b...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} interindividual {{variation and}} intra-individual phenotypic flexibility in {{basal metabolic rate}} (BMR), total evaporative water loss (TEWL), body temperature (T-b), the minimum dry heat transfer coefficient (h), and organ and muscle size of five species of larks geographically distributed along an aridity gradient. We exposed all species to constant environments of 15 degreesC or 35 degreesC, and examined to what extent interspecific differences in physiology {{can be attributed to}} acclimation. We tested the hypothesis that birds from deserts display larger intra-individual phenotypic flexibility and smaller intern individual variation than species from mesic areas. Larks from arid areas had lower BMR, TEWL, and h, but did not have internal organ, sizes different from birds from mesic habitats. BMR of 15 degreesC-acclimated birds was 18. 0 %, 29. 1 %, 12. 2 %, 25. 3 %, and 4. 7 % higher than of 35 degreesC-acclimated <b>Hoopoe</b> <b>Larks,</b> Dunn's Larks, Spike-heeled Larks, Skylarks, and Woodlarks, respectively. TEWL of 15 degreesC-acclimated <b>Hoopoe</b> <b>Larks</b> exceeded values for 35 degreesC-acclimated individuals by 23 % but did not differ between 15 degreesC- and 35 degreesC-acclimated individuals in the other species. The dry heat transfer coefficient was increased in 15 degreesC-acclimated individuals of Skylarks and Dunn's Larks, but not in the. other species. Body temperature was on average 0. 4 degreesC +/- 0. 15 degreesC (mean +/- 1 SEM) lower in 15 degreesC-acclimated individuals of all species. Increased food intake in 15 degreesC-acclimated birds stimulated enlargement of intestine (26. 9 - 38. 6 %), kidneys (9. 8 - 24. 4 %), liver (16. 5 - 27. 2 %), and. stomach (22. 0 - 31. 6 %). The pectoral muscle increased in 15 degreesC-acclimated Spike-heeled Larks and Skylarks, remained unchanged in <b>Hoopoe</b> <b>Larks,</b> and decreased in 15 degreesC-acclimated Woodlarks and Dunn's Larks. We conclude that the degree of intra-individual flexibility varied between physiological traits and among species, but that acclimation does not account for interspecific differences in BMR, TEWL, and h in larks. We found no general support for the hypothesis that species from desert environments display larger intra-individual phenotypic flexibility than those from mesic areas. The coefficient of variation of larks acclimated to their natural environment was smaller in species from and areas than in species from mesic areas for mass-corrected BMR and surface-specific h, but not for mass-corrected TEWL.

40|$|Birds from deserts {{generally}} have lower total evaporative water loss (TEWL), {{the sum of}} cutaneous (CWL) and respiratory water loss (RWL), than species from mesic areas. We investigated the role of CWL and RWL {{as a function of}} air temperature (T-a) in <b>hoopoe</b> <b>larks</b> (Alaemon alaudipes) and Dunn's larks (Eremalauda dunni) from the Arabian Desert and skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and woodlarks (Lullula arborea) from temperate mesic grasslands. The proportional contribution of CWL to TEWL in all larks at moderate T-a ranged from 50 % to 70 %. At high T-a (40 degrees+/- 45 degreesC), larks enhanced CWL by only 45 %- 78 % and relied on an increase in RWL by 676 %- 2, 733 % for evaporative cooling. Surface-specific CWL at 25 degreesC was 29 % lower in the arid-zone species than in the mesic larks. When acclimated to constant T-a, 15 degreesC-acclimated <b>hoopoe</b> <b>larks</b> increased CWL by 22 % compared with 35 degreesC-acclimated birds, but the other species did not change CWL. This study is consistent with the hypothesis that larks from deserts have a reduced CWL at moderate and low T-a but provided no support for the hypothesis that at high T-a larks from arid regions rely more on CWL than larks from mesic environments. Interspecific differences in CWL cannot be attributed to acclimation to environmental temperature and are possibly the result of genetic differences due to natural selection or of phenotypically plastic responses to divergent environments during ontogeny...|$|R

40|$|The {{adaptive}} {{significance of}} mechanisms {{of energy and}} water conservation among species of desert rodents, which avoid temperature extremes by remaining within a burrow during the day, is well established. Conventional wisdom holds that arid-zone birds, diurnal organisms that endure the brunt of their environment, occupy these desert climates because of the possession of physiological design features common to all within the class Aves. We review studies that show that desert birds may have evolved specific features to deal with hot desert conditions including: a reduced basal metabolic rate (BMR) and field metabolic rate (FMR), and lower total evaporative water loss (TEWL) and water turnover (WTO). Previous work on the comparative physiology of desert birds relied primarily on information gathered on species from the deserts of the southwestern U. S., which are semi-arid habitats of recent geologic origin. We include data on species from Old World deserts, which are geologically older {{than those in the}} New World, and place physiological responses along an aridity axis that includes mesic, semi-arid, arid, and hyperarid environments. The physiological differences between desert and mesic birds that we have identified using the comparative method could arise as a result of acclimation to different environments, of genetic change mediated by selection, or both. We present data on the flexibility of BMR and TEWL in <b>Hoopoe</b> <b>Larks</b> that suggest that phenotypic adjustments in these variables can be substantial.

40|$|Concern for {{environmental}} impact of chemical insecticides used for desert locust control has increased and improved knowledge about insecticide impact on faunal non-target organisms (NTOs) in the natural environments of the desert locust is needed. In this thesis, I investigated the impact of chlorpyrifos and carbosulfan on NTOs. I aimed at identifying species that were vulnerable to insecticides under natural conditions in a desert locust breeding area; the Red Sea Coast of Sudan. Survival rate, abundance, activity, density and species richness in a treated and an untreated area were compared using pre- and post-spray monitoring periods. Suitable reaction indicators and methodologies, which had potential {{for environmental}} monitoring of control operations, were sought. Juvenile prawns of Metapenaeus monoceros, (Penaeidae), in the mangrove lagoon were affected negatively by an aerial application of chlorpyrifos. Adverse effects were also detected on antlions, Cueta sp., (Myrmeleontidae), and <b>hoopoe</b> <b>larks,</b> Alaemon alaudipes, (Alaudidae), counted along transects. Negative effects, considered attributable to the insecticide application, were found using pitfall trapping for i) the beetle Mesostena angustata, (Tenebrionidae), ii) crickets both at the species level, Gryllus bimaculatus, and family level, Gryllidae, and iii) arachnids. Dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae and Aphodiinae) sampled in dung pats placed in the field showed a response to carbosulfan within 24 h after application against desert locusts. Abundance of Onthophagus margaritifer (Scarabaeinae) declined after spraying. Numbers of Aphodius lucidus (Aphodiinae) and Aphodiinae beetles at the subfamily level increased. There was a marked difference in dung beetle abundance and species richness between two biotopes; Acacia tortilis shrubland and cultivated wetland.

5000|$|Just like in humans, the {{distribution}} of trabeculae in bird species is uneven, depending on the loading conditions. The bird with the highest density of trabeculae is the kiwi, a flightless bird. There is also uneven distribution of trabeculae within the similar species such as the Great spotted woodpecker or Grey-headed woodpecker. After examining a microCT scan of the woodpecker’s forehead, temporomandibulum, and occiput {{it was determined that}} there is significantly more trabeculae in the forehead and occiput. Besides the difference in distribution, the aspect ratio of the individual struts was higher in woodpeckers than in other birds of similar size such as the Eurasian <b>Hoopoe</b> or the <b>Lark.</b> The woodpeckers’ trabeculae are more plate-like while the hawk and lark have rod-like structures networked through their bones. The decrease in strain on the woodpecker’s brain has been attributed to the higher quantity of thicker plate-like struts packed more closely together than the hawk or <b>hoopoe</b> or the <b>Lark.</b> Conversely, the thinner rod-like structures would lead to greater deformation.

40|$|The 'energy demand' {{hypothesis}} {{for short-term}} adjustments in {{basal metabolic rate}} (BMR) posits that birds adjust {{the size of their}} internal organs relative to food intake, a correlate of energy demand, We tested this hypothesis on <b>hoopoe</b> <b>larks</b> (Alaemon alaudipes), inhabitants of the Arabian desert, by acclimating birds for 3 weeks at 15 degreesC and at 36 degreesC, then measuring their BMR and total evaporative water loss (TEWL), Thereafter, we determined the dry masses of their brain, heart, liver, kidney, stomach, intestine and muscles of the pectoral region. Although mean body mass did not differ initially between the two groups, after 3 weeks, birds in the 15 degreesC group had gained mass (44. 1 +/- 6. 5 g), whereas larks in the 36 degreesC group had maintained a constant mass (36. 6 +/- 3. 6 g; means +/- S. D., N= 6). Birds in the 15 degreesC group had a mean BMR of 46. 8 +/- 6. 9 kJday(- 1), whereas birds in the 36 degreesC group had a BMR of 32. 9 +/- 6. 3 kJday(- 1), values that were significantly different when we controlled for differences in body mass. When measured at 35 degreesC, larks in the cold-exposure group had a TEWL of 3. 55 +/- 0. 60 gH(2) Oday(- 1), whereas TEWL for birds in the 36 degreesC group averaged 2. 23 +/- 0. 28 gH(2) Oday(- 1), a difference of 59, 2 %, Mass-independent TEWL differed significantly between groups, Larks in the 15 degreesC group had a significantly larger liver, kidney and intestine than larks in the 36 degreesC group. The total increase in organ mass contributed 14. 3 % towards the total mass increment in the cold exposure group, Increased food intake among larks in the cold group apparently resulted in enlargement of some of the internal organs, and the increase in mass of these organs required a higher rate of oxygen uptake to support them. As oxygen demands increased, larks apparently lost more evaporative water, but the relationship between increases in BMR and TEWL remains unresolved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGlobal {{warming is}} {{occurring}} {{at an alarming}} rate and predictions are that air temperature (Ta) will continue to increase during this century. Increases in Ta as a result of unabated production of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere pose a threat to the distribution and abundance of wildlife populations worldwide. Although all the animals worldwide will likely be affected by global warming, diurnal animals in the deserts will be particularly threatened in the future because Tas are already high, and animals have limited access to water. It is expected that Saudi Arabia will experience a 3 – 5 °C in Ta over the next century. For predicting the consequences of global warming for animals, {{it is important to understand}} how individual species will respond to higher air temperatures. We think that populations will not have sufficient time to make evolutionary adjustments to higher Ta, and therefore they will be forced to alter their distribution patterns, or make phenotypic adjustments in their ability to cope with high Ta. This report examines how increases in Ta might affect body temperature (Tb) in the animals of arid regions. We chose three taxonomic groups, mammals, birds, and reptiles (Arabian oryx, Arabian spiny-tailed lizard, vultures, and <b>hoopoe</b> <b>larks)</b> from Saudi Arabia, an area in which Ta often reaches 45 °C during midday in summer. When Ta exceeds Tb, animals must resort to behavioral and physiological methods to control their Tb; failure to do so results in death. The observations of this study show that in many cases Tb is already close to the upper lethal limit of around 47 °C in these species and therefore allowing their Tb to increase as Ta increases are not an option. We conclude that global warming will have a detrimental impact on a wide range of desert animals, but in reality we know little about the ability of most animals to cope with change in Ta. The data presented should serve as base-line information on Tb of animals in the Kingdom for future scientists in Saudi Arabia as they explore the impact of global warming on animal species...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{effectiveness}} of the protection measures currently in place to conserve the natural environment in Kuwait State. Comparison of protection effectiveness was based on the measurements of ecological habitat quality and biodiversity. In order to achieve this, 2 protected areas (SAANR and Kabd) and 2 comparable unprotected areas (B-SAANR and R-Kabd) were studied. In addition, an arable land area, the Pivot farm, was also studied. I examined the floral and avifaunal richness in these five areas. Distribution and abundance of members of the lark family Alaudidae, and the crested lark Galerida cristata in particular, were measured as a key habitat indicator. I also investigated the importance of water provison for wildlife. The diurnal use of a water hole and behaviour of crested larks during foraging and shading was observed. The challenge that larks face to cope with the high temperature during the breeding seasons was also examined. The assessment of the vegetation identified the plant species richness as an index of habitat types, and this was examined in relation to human activity factors (e. g. grazing, camping, etc). Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) showed three sample-groups of vegetation types (labelled A, B and C), a Haloxylon community (C); a sub-community (B: indicated by Helianthemum) of the Stipa community type; and a sub-community (A: indicated by Plantago and Schismus) of the mixed Stipa - Cyperus community type. Vegetation is a powerful indicator of land degradation in Kuwait. Richness of plant species was correlated negatively with land degradation. Lark species were used as indicators to measure the benefit of the current conservation measures. There was a significant difference between lark density and species richness in protected, non-protected and arable lands. Density of larks was very low in non-protected areas, being about one individual km- 2 (Figure 3. 3). An obvious conclusion from the results was the important role of protected areas in conservation context. As an example larks' species abundance and density in SAANR were remarkably higher than B-SAANR (Figure 3. 9 and 3. 10). Furthermore, all other larks' species were absent in B-SAANR area in both breeding and non-breeding seasons. 	This study showed the important role that a water hole can play in attracting wildlife in desert areas and in influencing several aspects of behaviour. Overall 96 animal species used the Talha water hole in SAANR, Kuwait throughout 2009. Talha water hole became an essential spot for attraction of most wildlife in the SAANR, especially in summer. There may of course be cost associated with gathering in one place, such as at a water hole. Gregarious birds optimize vigilant attentiveness according to their group size. My study on the behavior of crested larks during winter and summer seasons in Kuwait revealed the presence of relationships between vigilance behaviours (head up, crest up and closed eye) verses group size. The study showed there are strong linkages between these behaviours and flock size. I found also a correlation between sitting individuals and having their crest up during shading. In addition, these vigilance behaviours were affected by the density of flocks. Hence, distance between foragers influences their social vigilance. The breeding survey showed that larks face environmental challenges to breed in Kuwait. Absence of nests in unprotected areas B-SAANR and R-Kabd were correlated with their poor vegetation cover. Signs of larks breeding such as courtship display, protecting a territory or presence of nest were seen in the protected areas SAANR and Kabd. In SAANR, at least one of those signs was seen for greater <b>hoopoe</b> <b>larks,</b> crested larks and bar-tailed larks. In Kabd, juveniles of the black-crowned sparrow lark were seen. Arable lands can play an important role for resident breeding species, especially in annual seasons that are characterised by a shortage of rainfall. For example, crested larks and doves were attracted to the Pivot farm. Territories and nests of crested larks were identified in alfalfa and barley crops. The Pivot farm possess potential characteristics that are absent in open areas and in protected areas. Crested larks were found mostly nesting in arable lands to compensate for poor habitat quality, low vegetation cover and rainfall shortages in protected areas. The effect of macro and microhabitat nest site selections on larks and doves thermoregulation was examined to determine the favourable position of the nest. Position and site location showed a remarkable effect on nest temperature. Further more, nest temperatures varied between different habitats and vegetation cover. The Pivot farm presents a good alternative habitat for crested larks to breed until mid-June. To further study adaptations to warm weathers, I examined egg shell structure. A comparison of components of egg shell morphology reveals the presence of morphological and structural differences both between sibling species, and within the same species, collected at different latitudes. Two sibling species, crested larks Galerida cristata (from Kuwait) and skylarks Alauda arvensis (from the United Kingdom) have different egg volume, shell pigmentation and colour, thickness and water loss through the shell. The other sibling dove species showed difference in eggshell thickness between arid and temperate zones. Within the same species, the house sparrow Passer domesticus, variation in eggshell thickness was also found between birds from Kuwait and the United Kingdom. The eggshells of house sparrows were thinner in Kuwaiti samples than in those collected in the United Kingdom. Moreover, within the United Kingdom there was also a similar latitudinal trend, with Scottish shell samples being thicker and those from further south in the UK being thinner. There was however little difference in water loss. In addition, average length and width of laughing dove eggs varied between South Africa and Kuwait samples. Hence, they differ in egg volume. These results suggest local adaptation in egg shell structure. Egg shell thickness increased at higher latitudes in both the sibling species, and in the within species, comparisons. This suggests that latitude, presumably via the effects of environmental temperature, can influence optimal eggshell structure, since the pattern was similar across the lark species compared with the within species variation in the sparrows. My data also reveal some variations among the eggshell characteristic of larks in response to temperature and latitude. This study reveals the challenge that larks face to breed in Kuwait. To breed, a suitable secure habitat is essential. Habitat degradation was a remarkable in most non protected areas in Kuwait. Recommendations for conservation measures in Kuwait are discussed...|$|R
