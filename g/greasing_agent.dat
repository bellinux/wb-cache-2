2500|$|The idea {{of having}} {{anything}} which might be tainted with pig or beef fat in their mouths was unacceptable to the native soldiers, and when they objected {{it was suggested that}} they were more than welcome to make up their own batches of cartridges, using a religiously acceptable <b>greasing</b> <b>agent</b> such as ghee or vegetable oil. This seemed to prove that the issued cartridges were, in fact, greased with pig and/or beef fat. A further suggestion that the sepoys tear the cartridges open with their hands (instead of biting them open) was rejected as impractical - many of the sepoys had been undertaking musket drill daily for years, and the practice of biting the cartridge open was second nature to them. Incidentally, after the Mutiny, manuals amended the method of opening the cartridge to, [...] "Bring the cartridge to the forefinger and thumb of the left hand, and with the arm close to the body, carefully tear off the end without spilling the powder." [...] The indifference of many British commanding officers to the problem perceived by the sepoys only added more fuel to the already volatile situation, and helped spark the rebellion in 1857.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the biodegradation of a polymer derived from castor oil, which is a renewable, natural material that is a practical alternative for the replacement of traditional polyurethane foams. Due to its molecular structure, which contains polyester segments derived from vegetable oil, the polymeric surface is susceptible to microorganism attack. This study tested the biological degrading agent that was in contact with the microorganisms resulting from microbiological <b>grease</b> degrading <b>agents,</b> when foam was inoculated. Solid-media agar-plate tests were conducted for their potential to evaluate the biodegradation of polymeric particles by specific strains of microorganisms during 216 hours. The growth rate was defined. This technique provides a way of distinguishing the degradation abilities of microorganisms from the degradability of materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study the biodegradation of a polyurethane derived from castor oil, which contains polyester segment in its molecular structure, thus becoming susceptible to the microorganisms attack. The biodegradation of polyurethane was tested in contact with microorganisms resulting from microbiological <b>grease</b> degrading <b>agents,</b> in appropriate liquid media, with a duration of 156 days. The study was done by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetry (TG) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with accessory for attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR). The results suggest that the degradation of polyurethane derived from castor oil occurs. TG curves are used in order to indicate the biodegradation, showing changes between the thermal behavior of the samples that were inoculated with microorganisms and control. In the FTIR-ATR spectra, there are detectable changes between the spectra of control and attacked specimens; this suggests that degradation occurs, with the decreased intensity of the absorption band at 1042 cm- 1, corresponding to the esters links...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For the {{net shape}} forming of {{composite}} products with structure of SB/CF-EP (steel backing/carbon fabric reinforced epoxy) lining, the demolding is difficult. Aiming to net shape forming of transmission screw nuts with structure of SB/CF-EP, a new solution was proposed {{in which the}} high-strength casting wax was used as the release agent. A basic demolding experiment was designed and comparative demolding experiments were conducted for three different conditions: wax and <b>grease</b> as release <b>agents</b> and no agent. The influences of different agents and agent thickness on demolding force, product sizes and surface quality were studied. In comparison with grease and no release agent the demolding force for wax was reduced by 91. 6 % and 98. 0 % respectively. The product shrink could be compensated by controlling the wax thickness. By using wax release agent, the fabrication of transmission screw nuts with SB/CF-EP lining was successfully completed...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{contamination}} of bonding surfaces can drastically affect the bond strength {{that can be}} achieved and therefore the structural integrity and reliability of the bonded part. The presence of thin contaminant films on bonding surfaces can result from inadequate or incomplete cleaning methods, from oxide growth during the time between cleaning (such as grit blasting) and bonding, or from failure to properly protect cleaned surfaces from oils, <b>greases,</b> fingerprints, release <b>agents,</b> or deposition of facility airborne molecules generated by adjacent manufacturing or processing operations. Required cleanliness levels for desired bond performance can be determined by testing to correlate bond strength with contaminant type and quantity, thereby establishing the degree of contamination that can be tolerated based on the strength that is needed. Once the maximum acceptable contaminant level is defined, a method is needed to quantitatively measure the contaminant level on the bonding surface prior to bonding to verify that the surface meets the established cleanliness requirement. A photoelectron emission technique for the nondestructive inspection of various bonding surfaces, both metallic and nonmetallic, to provide quantitative data on residual contaminant levels is described. The technique can be used to scan surfaces at speeds of at least 30 ft/min using a servo system to maintain required sensor to surface spacing. The fundamental operation of the photoelectron emission sensor system is explained and the automated scanning system and computer data acquisition hardware and software are described...|$|R
40|$|What is {{the proper}} {{material}} and procedure for filling single-strand tendon stressing pockets? As {{the first line of}} defense for the corrosion protection of the stressing anchorage, a quality stressing pocket patch is essential for the long-term durability of the post-tensioning system. A premixed cementitious non-shrink grout described in the following and applied correctly to a well-prepared surface is required for filling single-strand tendon stressing pockets. A product best suited as a patch material is a high-quality premixed cementitious chloride-free non-shrink grout, mixed with limited amount of water per manufacturers’ recommendation for use as repair material. These repair grouts are designed specifically for filling concrete voids in vertical and overhead applications and are suitable for filling single-strand stressing pockets. All major cementitious material suppliers have prepackaged non-shrink grouts. The key to a quality stressing pocket patch is the use of the right patch material, the recommended surface preparation, and the proper mixing and application. These repair grouts must be mixed, applied, and cured per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Stressing pockets should be free from all PT coating, <b>grease,</b> form release <b>agents,</b> dirt, loose concrete, debris, or any deleterious material. Although it is accepted practice to place a small amount of PT coating or grease on the tip of the pocket former that is inserted into the anchor wedge cavity (particularly with standard nonencapsulated anchorages), any portion of the pocket former that comes into contact with the surrounding concrete should be free from all PT coating, grease, and form release. The inside surface of the pocket former recess should be cleaned with a wire brush or similar to ensure the proper bond of the patch material; a bonding agent may be applied. The recess must be immediately protected with filling material. An inspection of the surface preparation and filling of the anchorage pockets is highly desirable...|$|R
