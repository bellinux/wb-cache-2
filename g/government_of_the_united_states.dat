5|$|The Oppenheimer {{security}} {{hearing was}} a 1954 proceeding by the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) that explored the background, actions, and associations of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American scientist who had headed the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II, {{where he played}} a key part in the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb. The hearing resulted in Oppenheimer's Q clearance being revoked. This {{marked the end of}} his formal relationship with the <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> and generated considerable controversy regarding whether the treatment of Oppenheimer was fair, or whether it was an expression of anti-Communist McCarthyism.|$|E
5|$|The first {{definitive}} split over slavery {{occurred within}} the New School Presbyterian Church. In 1858, Southern synods and presbyteries {{belonging to the}} New School withdrew and established the pro-slavery United Synod of the Presbyterian Church.

5|$|After all the {{interviews}} concluded, {{the group of}} 208 men were convicted in summary courts-martial of disobeying orders, Article 4 of the Articles for the <b>Government</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Navy (Rocks and Shoals). Each man was subject to forfeiture of three months' pay. A few of them were held as witnesses in the upcoming mutiny trial. The rest were split into smaller groups and shipped out to various places in the Pacific Theater. Carl Tuggle, one of the 208, said in 1998 {{that a group of}} prisoners including himself were assigned menial tasks such as cleaning latrines and picking up cigarette butts at a series of Pacific islands. After returning from active duty they each received bad conduct discharges, which meant the loss of virtually all veterans' benefits.|$|E

5|$|An {{increasingly}} popular conspiracy theory among American right-wing populists {{is that the}} hypothetical North American Union and the amero currency, proposed by the Council on Foreign Relations and its counterparts in Mexico and Canada, {{will be the next}} milestone in the implementation of the New World Order. The theory holds that a group of shadowy and mostly nameless international elites are planning to replace the federal <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> with a transnational government. Therefore, conspiracy theorists believe the borders between Mexico, Canada and the United States {{are in the process of}} being erased, covertly, by a group of globalists whose ultimate goal is to replace national governments in Washington, D.C., Ottawa and Mexico City with a European-style political union and a bloated E.U.-style bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, the Red Cross and World Food Council (UNDRO) set up {{shelters and}} began {{assisting}} residents {{in need of}} food and shelter. Several thousand residents were provided food, clothing and shelter {{across the country in}} mass-feeding shelters. The UNDRO also contributed $461,000 in funds to the Philippines. Another $46,000 was provided by the Government of Norway and the Catholic Relief Services donated $50,000. The Government of Japan provided $300,000 and the <b>Government</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> donated $25,000 in response to the overall effects of Elsie and the three preceding storms. Two other non-governmental organizations, the Lutheran World Federation and World Council of Churches allocated $10,000 and $30,000, respectively, for the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|The <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> {{set up the}} National Helium Reserve in 1925 at Amarillo, Texas, {{with the}} goal of {{supplying}} military airships in time of war and commercial airships in peacetime. Because of the Helium Control Act (1927), which banned the export of scarce helium on which the US then had a production monopoly, together with the prohibitive cost of the gas, the Hindenburg, like all German Zeppelins, was forced to use hydrogen as the lift gas. The helium market after World War II was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of liquid helium as a coolant to create oxygen/hydrogen rocket fuel (among other uses) during the Space Race and Cold War. Helium use in the United States in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption.|$|E
