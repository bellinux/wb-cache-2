Coal from Indonesia East Kalimantan mine, which has high moisture and high volatile matter, was chosen as a sample. Experiments were carried out at the heating rate of 1, 000 oC/s and isothermal condition was kept at peak temperature under atmospheric pressure. The char, tar and gas formation characteristics of the coal {{as well as the}} composition of the gas components at peak temperatures were determined. The experimental results showed that devolatilization process terminated when temperature reached above 1, 100 oC. Most of tar was formed at about 800 oC, while the rate of tar formation decreased gradually as the temperature increased. CH 4 was observed at temperatures above 600 oC, whereas H 2 was detected above 1, 000 oC. The amount of formed gases such as H 2, CO, CH 4 and CnHm increased as the temperature increased. From the characteristics of devolatilization with residence time, it was con-cluded that devolatilization terminated within about 0. 7 second when the temperature reached 1, 000 oC.

40|$|Coal {{pyrolysis}} is the initial, accompanying {{reaction of}} a number of coal conversion processes such as hydrogenation, combustion and gasification. However, because of the inherent complexity of coal composition, it is difficult to describe coal pyrolysis clearly. Single model compounds have been used before in order to provide additional insight into the complex processes that occur in the pyrolysis of coal. Yet the picture obtained is a simplified one and certain important aspects such as coal structure, interactions between different surface groups and cross-links are omitted. The approach used in this work involves the preparation of a synthetic coal, SC, with a known structure by curing a mixture of single, well-defined model compounds. By means of chemical characterisation, the SC was shown to contain the macroscopic features of a <b>high</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>coal</b> (proximate and ultimate analyses). FTIR characterisation revealed the presence of functional groups similar to those of coal {{in the structure of the}} SC. Temperature-programmed pyrolysis tests were performed in a thermobalance linked to a mass spectrometer and a Fourier transform infrared analyser (TG/MS/FTIR). The thermal behaviour of the synthetic coal (i. e., rate of mass loss and the evolution profiles of gaseous compounds during pyrolysis tests) is very similar to that of the high volatile bituminous coal which was used as a reference material. The great advantage of using SC lies in the fact that its composition and structure can be accurately determined and employed in subsequent applications in basic and mechanistic studies.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{economic}} benefits of pulverised coal injection (PCI) into blast furnace include {{a reduction in the}} cost of hot metal, resulting primarily from decreased coke consumption and an increase in hot metal production. Since coal is consumed directly, without going through the cokemaking plant, PCI is also thought to be environmentally friendly. Therefore, PCI has become a standard practice in many blast furnaces worldwide. To improve the performance of PCI operation, a comprehensive understanding of pulverised coal combustion behaviours are required. The goal of this thesis was to study the coal burning characteristics in the regions of blowpipe, tuyere and raceway through both numerical and experimental methodology. From the validation of model, the calculation region and the application of calculated results in practice, the PCI combustion model was developed through 4 phases in this work: (1) validation of the coal combustion model by comparing its predictions with experimental data; (2) investigation into the influence of operation conditions to coal burnout in the regions of blowpipe and tuyere; (3) performance evaluation of coal blend injection in terms of pressure loss caused by combustion within a simplified raceway space; and (4) examination of combustion characteristics of oxy-coal injection technology in the regions of blowpipe, tuyere and raceway, which is a porous space featured by Eulerian-Eulerian multi-fluid approach. In the first phase, the performance of coal devolatilisation models and kinetic parameters were validated by comparing predicted gas temperature profiles with the experimental results of Burgess et al. (1983). It is found that the kinetic parameters proposed by Ubhayakar et al (1976) for the two competing devolatilisation model permit a reasonable simulation of the measured results for blast furnace conditions. The coal combustion in the regions of blowpipe and tuyere was modelled under the conditions of CSC’s N⁰ 3 blast furnace in the second phase. The influence of operation conditions to coal burnout was comprehensively studied. It is found early ignition can be achieved with higher coal burnout when the double lance is employed instead of the single one. Accordingly, the injection lance used at CSC was changed from the single to the double air-cooled coaxial lance arrangement in 2002. In the third phase, the calculation was extended to the raceway with simplified configuration. The performance of coal blend injection was examined. As indicated in the calculation results, a decrease in coal burnout is found with decreasing the coal volatile content, while the pressure loss within the raceway can be abated due to less volatile released to gas and moderate gas expansion in the combustion region. With improved permeability, more hot blast air can be introduced into the blast furnace for higher productivity. Consequently, the <b>high</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>coal</b> injection was replaced by the coal blend (mixtures of high and low volatile coals) injection at CSC in 2003. In the last phase, the Eulerian-Eulerian multi-fluid model was employed for the prediction of raceway configuration with consideration of coke combustion in all coke operation. Validation work against measured raceway shape and gas composition distribution by Nogami et al. (2005) indicates that the model is acceptable for the simulation. The calculation results show the oxy-coal lance injection enables to fulfil two contradictory conditions at the same time: (1) to retard the coal combustion for moderating the pressure loss in the upstream of coal plume; and (2) to enhance coal combustion and reduce unburnt char generation in the downstream of coal plume. Taking these advantages from the oxy-coal lance injection, blast furnaces can be operated with more blast for higher productivity, or with higher PCI rate for lower fuel cost, thereby achieving the goal of hot metal production with energy saving. In this work, a drop tube furnace has been established and used to provide fundamental insights on PCI coal combustion behaviours. The experiments were carried out in three stages. In the first stage, the volatile release and the generation of char particle and tiny aerosols in the region of coal plume were studied. Only the tested low volatile coal (HGI= 85) with larger size (100 - 200 mesh) exhibits fragmentation during heating. This may encourage the use of low volatile coals in granular coal injection. Significant char agglomeration is found for both tested high and low volatile coals with smaller size (200 - 325 mesh). It implies that excessive grinding may be avoided in PCI operation. Considering the generation of tiny aerosols composed of soot particles and tar droplets, it is mainly determined by the content of volatile matter and elemental oxygen. In the second stage, a technology has been developed and employed at CSC to evaluate the combustion efficiency of PCI coals. It is found that the coal burnout increases with decreasing the fuel ratio (FC/VM), except for certain coals departing from the general trend. It {{can be explained by the}} effect of maceral content to coal combustion. When the coal size is smaller than 200 mesh, the burnout can not be improved further, resulting from the agglomeration of fine particles. In the PCI operation at CSC, the coal quantity passing through 200 mesh has been reduced from 80 to 60 %. The experiments for the last stage aim to gain a fundamental insight into the combustion characteristics of pulverised biofuels under conditions pertinent to the raceway of blast furnace. From the van Krevelen diagram, it is found that the rate of hydrogen release from biomass fuels is faster than that of oxygen during the pre-treatment. An increase in pretreating temperature almost linearly decreases the burnout of biofuels. As revealed in the experimental results, the fuel properties, such as fuel ratio, burnout, and ignition temperature, of biomass torrefied at 300 °C or pyrolysed between 400 and 500 °C, are between a high-volatile bituminous coal and a low-volatile one. Therefore, the pretreated biomass can partially replace the coals consumed for PCI and blends with coals to keep reasonable burnout in raceways. It is emphasised that, due to the objectives of this thesis, some results or countermeasures obtained from the comprehensive experimental and numerical studies have been taken into PCI operation at CSC. This seems as a limitation of this study, but it may have a wide range of applications for the improvement of PCI operation...|$|E

40|$|Merrick's {{models have}} been {{employed}} to study the rate of devolatilization and the physical properties of the charge e. g., bulk density, true density, porosity, specific heat, thermal conductivity and heat of reaction as a function pf the temperature of carbonization. The equation for unsteady state heat transfer by conduction was employed to evaluate the temperature-time distribution in a coke oven charge. The paper gives the results of computer calculations for low and <b>high</b> <b>volatile</b> Jharia coking <b>coals</b> of India...|$|R
40|$|Selective pre{{saturation}} and saturation transfer {sup 129 }Xe NMR {{experiments were}} performed on a <b>high</b> <b>volatile</b> C bituminous <b>coal</b> and an anthracite. The experiments detect the movement of xenon atoms among {{different regions of the}} internal surface, and to the external surface of the coal particles. The results indicate that adsorbed xenon atoms can move to the external surface of the bituminous coal significantly faster than in the anthracite. The results are interpreted in terms of the porous structure of the coals...|$|R
