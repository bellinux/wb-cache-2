30|$|Renewable {{source of}} energy is the fastest growing source of world energy, with {{consumption}} increasing by 3 % per year [1]. This is due to its environmental friendliness as against the rising concern about {{the environmental impact of}} fossil fuel use and also strong government incentives for increasing renewable penetration in most countries around the world [1]. Globally, biomass currently provides around 46 EJ of bioenergy in the form of combustible biomass and wastes, liquid biofuels, solid biomass/charcoal and gaseous fuels. This share is estimated to be over 10 % of global primary energy, with over two-thirds consumed in developing countries as traditional biomass for household use [2]. Previous studies conducted to examine the economic impacts of using biomass energy clearly show that the benefits of production of briquettes for many economies clearly exist. However, there are several important factors that limit their utilization. The main reason is the high production cost resulting from high energy input in the production of various bioenergy fuel. From the past to the present, various scientists have carried out studies that have led to the improvement and better understanding of the technology for production of biomass briquettes. For example, {{it has been reported that}} pre-heating the biomass raw materials before pressing could reduce the power requirement for pressing of briquettes [3]. In a study conducted to improve biomass briquetting, it was observed that an average electrical energy saving at the <b>heater,</b> <b>motor</b> and overall system were 23.5 %, 10.8 % and 10.2 %, respectively. This was achieved when the biomass raw material was heated before pressing [3]. Other studies suggest that blending of two biomass raw materials could improve the durability characteristics of briquettes produced [4]. Material and process variables that could additionally influence the physical and mechanical characteristics of briquettes are compacting pressure, moisture content, particle size distribution of biomass raw material and temperature. According to [5], briquettes manufactured at lower pressures (30 to 60 MPa) fall to pieces easily. However, briquettes produced at higher pressures (150 to 250 MPa) are consistent and compact. Furthermore, the density and durability (mechanical strength) of briquettes are inversely proportional to the particle size since smaller particles have greater surface area during densification [6]. In this paper, the researchers investigated the effect of species, particle size and compacting pressure on relaxed density and compressive strength in cleft of fuel briquettes made at room temperature using low compacting pressure.|$|E

The major concern of the study is the interaction between the iron core and the HTS coil. This study first provides a brief introduction of the resistivity-adaption algorithm (RAA) method, which is used to simulate the field penetration, based on a given flux motion theory.

50|$|Every time an {{electrical}} power device (for example: <b>heaters,</b> lamps, <b>motors,</b> transformers or similar power loads) turns on or off, its switch, relay or contactor transitions either from a closed {{to an open}} state (break arc) or from an open to a closed state (make arc & bounce arc), under load, {{an electrical}} arc occurs between the two contact points (electrodes) of the switch. The break arc is typically more energetic and thus more destructive.|$|R

In a two-stage watchdog, the first timer {{is often used to}} activate fail-safe outputs and start the second timer stage; the second stage will reset the computer if the fault cannot be corrected before the timer elapses.|$|R

40|$|An eight-pole radial {{magnetic}} bearing has been modified into a switched-reluctance electric motor capable of operating {{at a speed}} as high as 8, 000 rpm at a temperature as high as 1, 000 F (= 540 C). The motor (see figure) is an experimental prototype of starter-motor/generator units that have been proposed to be incorporated into advanced gas turbine engines and that could operate without need for lubrication or active cooling. The unique features of this motor are its electromagnet coils and, to some extent, its control software. Heretofore, {{there has been no}} commercial-off-the-shelf wire capable of satisfying all of the requirements for fabrication of electromagnet coils capable of operation at temperatures up to 1, 000 F (= 540 C). The issues addressed in the development of these electromagnet coils included thermal expansion, oxidation, pliability to small bend radii, micro-fretting, dielectric breakdown, tensile strength, potting compound, thermal conduction, and packing factor. For a test, the motor was supported, along with a rotor of 18 lb (. 8 -kg) mass, 3 -in. (. 7. 6 -cm) diameter, 21 -in. (. 53 -cm) length, on bearings packed with high-temperature grease. The motor was located at the mid span of the rotor and wrapped with <b>heaters.</b> The <b>motor</b> stator was instrumented with thermocouples. At the time of reporting the information for this article, the motor had undergone 14 thermal cycles between room temperature and 1, 000 F (. 540 C) and had accumulated operating time > 27. 5 hours at 1, 000 F (= 540 C). The motor-controller hardware includes a personal computer equipped with analog-to-digital input and digital-to-analog output cards. The controller software is a C-language code that implements a switched-reluctance motor-control principle: that is, it causes the coils to be energized in a sequence timed to generate a rotating magnetic flux that creates a torque on a scalloped rotor. The controller can operate in an open- or closed-loop mode. In addition, the software has been modified to enable the simultaneous operation of the prototype motor or another, similar apparatus as both a motor and a {{magnetic bearing}}.

40|$|After {{implementing}} several {{energy efficiency}} standards and labels (30 products covered by MEPS, 50 products covered by voluntary labels and 19 products by mandatory labels), the China National Institute of Standardization (CNIS) is now implementing verification and compliance mechanism {{to ensure that}} the energy information of labeled products comply with the requirements of their labels. CNIS is doing so by organizing check testing on a random basis for room air-conditioners, refrigerators, <b>motors,</b> <b>heaters,</b> computer displays, ovens, and self -ballasted lamps. The purpose of the check testing is to understand the implementation of the Chinese labeling scheme and help local authorities establishing effective compliance mechanisms.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a calorimeter that is suitable for measuring power losses in electrical motors of up to 300 kW (402 hp). Refined from the two previous generations, this calorimeter is of air-cooled open type. Accurate control of the air flow rate and temperature gradients between the inside and outside walls of the calorimeter ensures that a repeatable and durable measurement environment is achieved. During the design stage, attention is focused on heat leakage prevention and reduction in the length of the testing procedures. Heat leakage is mitigated by appropriate insulation and active temperature control over all walls and connection ports. In selecting the materials for the structure, lightweight aluminum and polystyrene are used in sandwich form to reduce the thermal time constant and, thus, the operational time for the calorimeter to reach its equilibrium. After the calorimeter is commissioned, further reduction in the lengthy test procedures is realized by boosting the initial power loss value of the motor under test. That is, some additional resistive heaters are installed inside the calorimeter and operate in conjunction with the test motor. This push-pull technique can guarantee a constant combined power loss during operation, which is assumed to be the final value of motor loss. By predefining a suitable motor loss and a tolerance, it is possible to dynamically control the input power to the dc heaters from the start and to shut down the <b>heaters</b> once the <b>motor</b> loss value enters the tolerance selected. Calibration results confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the calorimeter...|$|R

Depending on culture and on geographic location, either thermal contact with the mother or thermal insulation {{has been a major}} form of protection for many centuries. The purpose of this study has been to design and implement a closed loop control system to regulate the temperature inside a neonatal incubator. This closed loop control system has been designed using the software in the loop technique, which minimizes the hardware related work and concentrates all the decision- making in the software. The closed loop implemented is a combination of sensing devices and actuators that operate synchronously to provide a stable thermal environment inside the incubator. The sensing devices are ve resistance temperature detectors placed following the IEC- 60601 standards, two current sensors, which give feedback information about the power consumption of the actuators, and two disturbance sensors that provide information about the opening of the incubator clappers.

40|$|This {{project title}} is ‘Temperature-Control System’ {{which is a}} {{particular}} system for server room. For the circuit, it consists of temperature sensor, PIC, LCD, driver circuits, AC air <b>heater</b> and AC <b>motor.</b> Three drivers are used for triggering process to switch on the AC heater and another two are for triggering levels of the motor. This motor will operate based on two temperature ranges and that means, it has two levels of speed. The function of this system is for controlling the temperature value inside of a regular room automatically. It will operate based on the values or ranges of temperature in the room which is detected by the temperature sensor. If {{the temperature in the}} first range (0 ºC to 15 ºC),the air heater will be operated to heat the server room which in very cold temperature. If it is in the second range(16 ºC to 25 ºC) this system will not be enabled because it’s achieving normal temperature range. If temperature in range 26 ºC to 40 ºC,motor will be triggered for level 1 to decrease the temperature value. If it is more than 40 ºC, the motor will be triggered for level 2 and its speed becomes faster at this level. The both output devices are important to maintain the temperature value in the room. This system can be categorized in automatic system class and solve users’ problem. The problem always happen if air-conditioner broke down and definitely, the room becomes hotter or temperature increases.

40|$|In its operation, every {{electrical}} device generates electromagnetic disturbance signals. They can {{be due to}} the operation of components of the device (step <b>motors,</b> <b>heaters,</b> control circuits, or electronic circuits). Quite often such signals have the characteristics of the data processed on such devices. They can have the form of a text. In each case, such signals are undesirable. However, they can be used to reproduce such data or, in other word, to conduct the process of electromagnetic infiltration. In the case of video signals (graphic mode of a computer, a laser printer), then the reproduced data can be presented in the form of graphic images that can be easily assimilated by people. Such images are transformed in order to find the data that is of interest. Reproduction of such data may lead to a disclosure of classified information. There are many solutions that should counter the process of reproduction of such data. Such solutions are implemented in the design of equipment and influence, to a lesser or greater extent, the appearance of the equipment, as well as the related organizational methods. A new method {{that can be used in}} electromagnetic protection of process data is a software solution. It involves the use of appropriate computer fonts. The article presents the possibilities related to shaping the form of video signals. For this purpose, appropriate shapes of the letter characters of computer fonts were recommended. Unlike characters in standard fonts (Arial and Times New Roman), they do not have the unique decorative elements (serif), such as hooks, connectors, heels, arches, and ribbons, and consist of only vertical and horizontal lines [5]. There are no slanted and crooked lines. Due to this, the characters are often very similar. This greatly contributes to the impossibility to differentiate between the letter characters in the reproduced image that is filled with noise and numerous disturbances. The graphic elements being searched, having the form of strings of letters, cannot be read. The digital image processing methods intended to improve the quality of the image are quite ineffective. In search for graphic characters, such as computer font letter and digit characters, one can use methods based on the similarity of the standard with a portion of the analyzed image. However, when special fonts are used, the correlation method generates many false decisions, which also prevents reading text data...|$|R
50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the <b>motor.</b> <b>Heaters</b> are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the <b>motor.</b> Bimetallic <b>heaters</b> function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|R
