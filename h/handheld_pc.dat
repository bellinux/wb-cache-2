2500|$|Originally called Office Mobile {{which was}} shipped {{initially}} as [...] "Pocket Office", {{was released by}} Microsoft with the Windows CE 1.0 operating system in 1996. [...] This release was specifically for the <b>Handheld</b> <b>PC</b> hardware platform, as Windows Mobile Smartphone and Pocket PC hardware specifications {{had not yet been}} released. [...] It consisted of Pocket Word and Pocket Excel; PowerPoint, Access, and Outlook were added later. With steady updates throughout subsequent releases of Windows Mobile, Office Mobile was rebranded as its current name after the release of the Windows Mobile 5.0 operating system. [...] This release of Office Mobile also included PowerPoint Mobile for the first time. [...] Accompanying the release of Microsoft OneNote 2007, a new optional addition to the Office Mobile line of programs was released as OneNote Mobile. With the release of Windows Mobile 6 Standard, Office Mobile became available for the Smartphone hardware platform, but unlike Office Mobile for the Professional and Classic versions of Windows Mobile, creation of new documents is not an added feature. A popular workaround is to create a new blank document in a desktop version of Office, synchronize it to the device, and then edit and save on the Windows Mobile device.|$|E
