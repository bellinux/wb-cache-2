Airbags may seem like a simple, low-tech product, but it was eye-opening to discover just how little we knew about them.

40|$|Tibi Guissou, {{microbiologist}} at the INERA {{agricultural research}} institute. Generally a reserved character, Tibi Guissou lights {{up when he}} talks about two topics his research on micro-organisms which live in symbiosis with plants and Spore. His first encounter with the magazine dates back to 1994. At the time, he was finishing his university studies and was doing an internship at the Institut de l environnement et de recherches agricoles (INERA), the agricultural research institute in Burkina Faso where he now works. He found the magazine lying on a table, flicked through it and was captivated. But being a prudent suitor, he was at first happy just to read it, allowing himself occasional furtive visits to his beloved, of whom he still considered himself unworthy. As a young student, I <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> <b>know</b> how to get the magazine, he recalls. I never imagined that I too could receive it. Mr Guissou took his time before subscribing to Spore in 1997. Ever since, his favourite magazine has had a special place on his desk. The issues have piled up over the years. When it fails to arrive on time, he rushes to the documentation centre. Impatient, he fears the worst. In the Netherlands, would the parents of his beloved prevent her from coming out? He could quite believe it, since in his country, a prospective husband must tend the fields of his future in-laws and make them gifts. And he knows he has done none of these things. Then, another thought comes to mind: could she have been carried off by some rival, perhaps by the postman? Comparing the magazine to a talented chef, he confides, I want to discover what she has prepared, in the hope that this time, the dish will be even better than the one before. Like any attentive companion, Spore, plies him with advice. Working on a water and soil conservation project in 1994, Mr Guissou began experimenting with living hedges. These natural barriers protect plants from strong winds in the dry season and ensure that market gardeners get a good crop of vegetables. But to introduce a new technique, {{it is not enough to}} shout it from the rooftops. You need to know how to put across the message, and engineers are not always very good at that. The technical publications and leaflets I order help me to develop the right approach for dealing with rural communities. As a result, I am better able to judge what kind of message to get across to people, and can more easily assess their needs and take their concerns into consideration, explains Mr Guissou. In the articles he writes for specialist magazines, he frequently quotes Spore. Unlike other publications which focus too much on one aspect, Spore has a more multi-disciplinary approach, observes the researcher, who has done work on the jujube, inspired by an article from the magazine.

40|$|As organizações estão cada vez mais pressionadas a responderem às demandas do mercado e às mudanças sofridas com rapidez, porém buscando as melhores práticas em seus processos. Esta pesquisa procurou, neste contexto, verificar a possibilidade de inter-relação entre a área de Gestão do Conhecimento, que visa o capital intelectual da empresa e seu fomento através do compartilhamento de conhecimento com a área de Treinamento e Desenvolvimento de pessoas, que lida com a capacidade de aprendizado dos funcionários. Outros objetivos foram: analisar os conceitos de Gestão do Conhecimento e de Treinamento e Desenvolvimento disponíveis na literatura, relacioná-los às informações disponíveis em sites de empresas que demonstraram aplicar tais processos em seu ambiente, verificando as adequações ou as inadequações existentes, e, identificar as contribuições da Ciência da Informação para estes processos. O método que norteou esta pesquisa foi o indutivo, possuindo característica qualitativa e bibliográfica. Para tanto, foram escolhidas duas empresas que disponibilizam em seus sites informações sobre os dois processos. A {{bibliografia}} selecionada sobre tais processos embasou análise dos sites. Após a análise, identificou-se que a empresa A pratica a Gestão do Conhecimento e o processo de Treinamento e Desenvolvimento seguindo as tendências norteadoras desta área. A empresa B não tem uma prática clara de Gestão do Conhecimento, porém o processo de Treinamento e Desenvolvimento, assim como na empresa anterior, segue as tendências orientadoras da área. Considerou-se também que a Ciência da Informação, tendo a informação como seu insumo básico, contribui satisfatoriamente para estes processos, já que lida com a essência que originará a formação do conhecimento, e que foi a base de estudo nesta pesquisa. Concluiu-se que há convergência entre os processos de Treinamento e Desenvolvimento e Gestão do Conhecimento, visto que o crescimento e desenvolvimento corporativo pressupõem, em dias atuais, a capacidade da empresa em criar conhecimento novo, compartilhando-o entre os funcionários e agregando-o, de forma concreta através do aprendizado, a processos, serviços e produtos. The {{organizations have}} been pressioned {{to adapt to the}} economy, so fast, but is necessary to do the better in their job. This paper wanted, in this context, to verify the possibility of the relation between Knowledge Management, that look at the business intellectual capital and promoting it throughout the knowledge sharing and the personnel Training and Development area, that works with the employee learning capability. Other objectives were: to analyze the Knowledge Management and Training and Development concepts available in the literature, doing a relation with the available concepts in organizations sites that put into practice these processes in their environment, verifying if existing or not adjustment, trying to detect possibles contributions of the Information Science. The method was inductive with bibliographic and qualitative characteristics. To do the verifying about the possible relation between Knowledge Management and Training and Development processes, two organizations were chosen, because there was available in their sites some informations about these ones. The bibliography that has been chosen was the based to the analysis. After this, has been identified that the organization A do the Knowledge Management and Training and Development processes, like the directing tendencies to this area. The organization B <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> <b>know</b> clearly about the Knowledge Management, but apply overall the Training and Development processes, like the organization A following the directing tendencies. This paper also considered so that the Information Science has the information in it base, that this one contribute satisfactorily to the Knowledge Management and Training and Development processes therefore the information is the knowledge origin, and has been the base to this paper. Concluding, ratify that Knowledge Management and Training and Development processes are convergent whereas the business increasing and development presume, nowadays, the organization capacity to generate new knowledge, sharing it between the employees and join it through learning, to the proceedings, services and products...|$|E

The research was done inside on a glass green house at the UNESP - College of Agronomical Science, Rural Engineering Department (Botucatu - SP - Brazil). Two trials were done to evaluate biomass, seedling height and diameter development. The first trial, using underground water on 17 cm, 31 cm and 45 cm depth, with or without coverage fertilization with N-P-K. The second trial was done with 28 flowerpots (12 liters each) and 3 seedlings per unit. The experimental design, {{used to evaluate the}} height and diameter growth and hydric potential and relative plant water content, was: 1 - without water deficit and without coverage fertilization; 2 - with water deficit and without coverage fertilization; 3 - without water deficit and with coverage fertilization; 4 - with water deficit and coverage fertilization. The underground water result showed that 31 cm and fertilization was better for seedling growing rather that 17 cm and without fertilization. The fertilized treatments showed higher plant high and diameter comparing to non fertilized samples, using Tukey test at 5 %. For dry plant matter, the best results were obtained with 31 and 45 cm underground water level. The seedling root system dry mass was decrement along the soil profile. The treatment with underground water of 31 cm and fertilization was superior according to Tukey test at 5 % of probability and the treatment with underground water of 17 cm and without fertilization was inferior for root dry mass (g).

40|$|Jane {{is of the}} new {{generation}} of information professionals: open, enthusiastic, committed, demand-responsive. Between workshops at a CTA seminar on farmers organisations, she spoke with Spore about her work, deeds and dreams. Listen in to a chat under a tree. She has just said, intoning it three times, that 'Information is power'. Why is that so important to her? 'When someone has information and knowledge, they have confidence, and the skills to take informed decisions. ' Is she saying that a person is only a full person when they have full confidence, that some people she works with are not full people, not full farmers? In a way, she agrees. Some farmers do not have full confidence, even though they and their predecessors may have been farming for centuries. They have information about practical aspects, of course, but they do not have enough about the market. If you re a farmer and don t know what the market demand is, you may be producing maize very well, according to best farming practices, but there may be no market. And then you lose interest in your maize, because it has lost its value for you. What about the power angle, we wonder? Our work, Jane reflects, is about people having the power and confidence that comes from being informed. Most times people fear to stand up and speak, because they re not so sure whether they are going to say the right thing. If you re informed, then you re confident, you can say the right thing, or ask the right question at the right time. It helps you to be involved. She works in, she is, the information department of her organisation, we remark, so she must have the key {{to a lot of people}} s confidence. To some extent, she admits, I do, to their confidence and their power. I select information, and I am its gateway. In fact, I need more confidence to get more correct information. The other people working in our organisation could be the source, and I need them to appreciate the role of information more. They may be a scientist, agriculturalist, extension worker, or in marketing or credit, and when I ask them for an article, they may feel they have other, more important work. Do people really still think like that, we prompt her, in the 21 st century, in the information age, do some people resist? Not outright, we are assured, not intentionally. The thing is that most people do not appreciate information because it is not tangible, you cannot touch and feel it. An extension worker can tell a farmer about growing maize, about the spacing to use, and she shows the spacing; or about seeds, and she shows the seeds, and the farmer can appreciate. With information, it does not feel so immediate. She leans forward, wanting to sound more positive. Some people do appreciate information, though. Some farmers write into the Farmers Voice (FV) magazine. We joke, in passing, about how readers letters are at the front of her magazine and at the back in Spore, and about which is better. She tells of a farmer in the central region, whom she met at a workshop on effective communication. He told her 'I read an article about a farmer in another part of the country growing passion fruit and oranges, and I thought if my fellow farmer can do it, why not me?' Passion fruit is now his major source of income, and he is better able to survive. What he impressed on his fellow participants in the workshop was to appreciate knowledge, and to always seek it. For him, knowledge changed his life. There was another farmer I wrote about, he <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> <b>know</b> English, so he couldn t read it himself. He was read about even in Denmark, where UNFFE s major donor is. A Danish farmers organisation got interested, and when they sent a film crew to Uganda they visited him. Finally he was given a special course in extension work, because he was seen as a farmer who can pass on knowledge to his fellow farmers. Believe you and me, he has become very confident; when he comes to the office now, he s not the same person I met the first time on his farm. He s blossomed, he ll come and ask for this and that, knowing that he knows what other people want to know. Is everyone special like that farmer, we wonder? Not everyone: some read something, appreciate it and put it into practice, others will not do anything concrete. Is information, we chip in, a lot like seeds falling on fertile or stony ground, as in the Biblical tale? Jane develops the idea: it s not a question of stony ground. The land may well be fertile, but it may need rainfall. Some information may fall on its fertile land but it lacks rain. People s energy can do the same to information as rainfall to a seed. She talks proudly about her organisation s radio shows, its cassette libraries for farmers in six languages. About how each copy of FV is read by four people, how it reaches schools, how she wants to increase circulation above the current ceiling of 2, 000 and finance it with advertising. What has disappointed her? The printed press s scant coverage of agriculture. The attitudes of journalists wanting facilitation and editors putting in news about growing beans, but not bigger issues which affect policy. She fires herself up and talks about holding a workshop for journalists, to win their pens. Does she have a dream, a professional dream? Her eyes glitter more, her hand strokes the air firmly. I want to be in a network, helping get the right information to the farmers. There s a need for a one-stop shop but it hasn t happened yet because people she means investors, support agencies have not appreciated the value of information circulating. But, we all know, they haven t met Jane yet. Confidence personified.

40|$|We {{had done}} well {{to heed the}} advice of Mamadou, to wrap up against the chilly Mauritanian night and the bumps of his boat. "You ll be sore long before dawn," he had winked, "stay alert by {{counting}} my catch, on the fingers of one hand if it s like it was last week. " In the distance, west-north-west, under the fleeting light of a moon, lights jerk and bob and swing like dancers grouped above the waves. The whish of the wind is broken by an occasional barked comment in the dark, or a fisherman chatting into a mobile phone. Mamadou s solemn face is almost golden from his lantern, except when he turns on his hand-held computer. Then it beams the image, a ghost-like grey, of a satellite-guided map as if he <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> <b>know</b> his exact position anyway, some 10 km offshore, above sandbanks washed by the high tide. We peer to the west, deep into the dark. See them or not, hear them or not, there lie the fleets of factory boats, busy vacuuming the ocean deep sucking out every atom of life from the sea, {{as if it was}} dust, and as if there is no tomorrow. There is, to be sure, no tomorrow in a world which treats its open seas, and all that lives there, as rapaciously as a horde of looters raiding a shopping centre after a fire. The results of this overfishing are clear. For a local fishing community, such as the Mauritanian fisherfolk, it is the loss of catches today that will affect their tomorrow, since the intricate ecosystem of the ocean that allows many species to spawn will have been severely disturbed. That sets off an ugly spiral of sagging incomes, no investment, erosion of local livelihoods, impact on culture and worse. For fisherfolk 7, 000 km away, off the white sands of the Tanzanian and Mozambican coasts, the impact of foreign trawlers at sea is compounded by the development of coastal tourist facilities which impede access to inshore fishing grounds. Continue south-east another 1, 000 km or so, to the coasts of Madagascar there industrial-scale prawn farms have dislodged both local fisherfolk and the mangroves so cherished as the breeding ground of aquatic biodiversity. Catch your customer Why are the coastal waters off Namibia, Mauritania and Senegal some of the most fertile fishing grounds in the world so full of foreign fishing boats: from China, Japan, the ex-Soviet Union and, in great numbers, the European Union? Why do EU boats negotiate fishing rights around the vulnerable island of Kiribati, literally {{on the other side of}} the world (see Spore 101) ? The answer lies in part in the marine flesh piled high in the worlds fish markets, such as the raw and raucous fish halls of Tokyo in Japan, or Madrid in Spain. As any fish trader there will tell you with myopic passion, there is a demand to be met, even if fish prices in the shops are soaring as fast as nets being hauled to the surface. The answer lies too in the chained-up trawlers on Canada s north-eastern coast, or on the almost deserted fish quay of North Shields in north-eastern England. Once, North Shields was home to 122 fishing boats, which played their part in depleting the North Sea of the cod and herring so much a part of European culture. No more. In mid-June 2003, a local skipper told Spore that the quay was "on the brink of decimation", with the three remaining boats having too few permits to chase too few fish. The hunt for more fish is getting harder. Less for locals To fish is to hunt, and there is not much wrong with that. Man is a hunter, after all. Professor Stella Williams of Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria calls fishing "an ancient human tradition, involving the hunting and gathering of aquatic products for food", though she forcefully emphasises the role of women in inshore fishing, and in processing and marketing. "The tradition of fishing has been transformed over several decades to become a resource extraction industry spanning the entire globe. Nature s limits of aquatic life have been breached by too many fishing craft catching too many fish. " One simple sum brings her point home: more than 60 % of fish products consumed in the EU come from outside EU waters, and yet 70 % of fish stocks worldwide, said the FAO in 2000, can be considered as fully or over-exploited. The result: less for locals, themselves prone to overfishing. According to FAO, over the past 30 years the availability of fish per capita in Africa as a whole has declined, and in countries such as Ghana and Liberia the average diet contained less fish protein in the 1990 s than it did during the 1970 s, when it accounted for about 20 % of the animal-protein intake. For nine African countries, fishing contributed more than 5 % of Gross Domestic Product in 2000. In the Caribbean and Pacific, similar levels exist but all countries are vulnerable. Yet look at the development plans of most of the 63 ACP States with coastal fisheries, from trade to livelihood to nutrition, and there is always an assumption of increased and improved fisheries. It s a management problem Just as men and women on land soon caught on to the benefits of stewarding the resources they would hunt and gather agriculture, in a word then so it must be when they visit the sea. An EU fisheries spokesman recently defended its fishing policies: "Fishing in third countries is not unethical, the point is to make sure it is done in a proper way. " One attempt is contained in the Fisheries Partnership Agreements which transform bilateral deals from the earlier pay, fish and go access agreements that allowed about 500 EU boats to fish in ACP waters into joint investment in sustainable fisheries. This is a sea change indeed; no wonder that the talk at the April 2003 co-seminar of the Commonwealth Secretariat and CTA in Brussels, Belgium on ACP-EU fisheries relations was full of words like "challenges" and "broadening mutual interests". When the cake has to shrink, who wants to slice it? What shines through the mists of mistrust are two, irreconcilable attitudes. One is the dogma of EU fishery interests: accepting a repackaging, but not a restructuring, of their apparent right to fish anyone s fish. At play here are consumer interests, electoral concerns about job losses in European ports and some very well-placed, and somewhat cavalier, vested interests. Against them stands the more reasonable approach, often spawned in civil society, to re-engineer a sector that has over-extended itself. For the former, it is the blunt negotiation of how much can we get?. For the latter, the issues are more subtle. How to redirect the massive EU subsidies from EU fleets and their low quayside prices, to the overriding need for proper management not so much of marine resources, but of the way people deal with them: methods, measurements, catch periods, monitoring and policing, capacity building, local processing, quotas for local markets, regulatory mechanisms, and even fair fishing? How to mesh redirected subsidies with the World Trade Organization s intolerance of any at all? Management, too, of the process of including small fishing communities in the development of coastal aquaculture and marine farming, as opposed to simply more responsible marine hunting. Give fish a chance At the macro-level, in Europe, North America and North-east Asia, there is frantic but focused lobbying of the donor communities to redirect their resources to empower local communities in the management of their fisheries in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia and the Pacific. And at the micro-level, there are heartening examples of exchanges between fisherfolk of the Caribbean and West Africa, or the Indian state of Kerala and East Africa, swapping experiences in catch management, cooperative organisation and processing. Many solutions lie in such local initiatives, but the real problem fishing fleets from afar lurks out on the horizon. It is on that horizon that change has to come. Every culture has its fishing songs. From the quay of North Shields in England, comes this one, but it could be from anywhere: "Dance to your daddy, my little laddie; dance to your daddy, my little man; you shall have a fishy on a little dishy; you shall have a fishy when the boat come in. " In terms of ACP-EU fisheries relations, the question is not only whose boat it will be that comes in or if there will be a fishy aboard, but also if there are any little laddies (and lasses) still there when it does. We really should be going fishing no more. Not unless there are political and economic changes as deep as any ocean...|$|E

The method used was by calculating PDRB growth percentage in each sectors and percentage of workforce absorption development in each sectors in each cities in East Java. From the percentage equation of the PDRB change and workforce absorption change, there could be concluded that elasticity level from 9 economic sector in each city was inelastic.

In April 1946, Okinawa took the 8 - 4 educational system. Under this system, they <b>didn.</b> <b>t</b> have a subject called social studies. Instead, there were such subjects as history, geography, and civics in the humanities. And the contents of history, geography, and civics in Okinawa were diﬀerent from those taught in the Japanese prewar-education. Japanese teaching materials were banned, and instead, they taught Okinawa. s history, geography, and civics, which were called “the WAY of Okinawa”. It reflected occupational politics of the U. S.

In addition we wanted {{to find out if the}} doctors perceived these expectations and if it influenced prescribing. Material and methods: Questionnaire-study at Oslo Legevakt (emergency service) where patients (n= 180) with symptoms of ARTI and the consulted doctors (n= 27) participated. The patients were separated into a Nordic and a non-Nordic group. Results: 38 % of the patients expected antibiotics. There were no significant differences between the Nordic and the non-Nordic group. Patients who reported to be very/quite ill, wanted antibiotics more often than those who reported to be quite well. Age above 30 years was also associated with positive expectation. The doctors perceived the expectations of 41 % of the patients who wanted antibiotics and of 69 % of those who <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> want. When the doctor thought the patient wanted antibiotics, 44 % got a prescription. Interpretation: Less than half of the patients with symptoms of ARTI wanted antibiotics. The doctors are better at perceiving negative expectations for antibiotics.

In most of the cases infection with Campylobacter spp. in humans originate from contaminated poultry meat and poultry meat products. This study was designed to estimate prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in meat and meat products imported in Republic of Macedonia. During the period of 8 months (January-August 2008) we tested 56 samples of meat and meat products (poultry meat, MDM, pork meat, beef meat and smoked beef). Samples were submitted to analysis for detection of thermo-tolerant Campylobacter spp. according to ISO 10272 : 1995. We determined among the analyzed samples highest prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in MDM with 84 % positive samples, poultry meat with 81, 8 %, pork meat with 10 %. We <b>didn.</b> <b>t</b> detect any positive samples in beef meat and smoked beef. Overall prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in all tested samples was 55, 36 %.

This area is strongly affected by emissions. Diet research was conducted with method of pellets analysis which were taken from nest boxes during nesting period. 32 samples were collected during this two years study. Each sample represents content of diet from one nest box during one nesting period. 6 samples with 259 individuals were from 2014 while 26 samples with 1349 individuals were collected in 2015. In total 1608 individuals were found during 2014 - 2015, out of them 33 birds (Aves) and 1575 mammals (Mammalia). Diet content was changing during study years, depending on availability of prey. Main part of diet represented mammals (97, 9 %), rest of diet was built by birds (2, 1 %). Between 2014 - 2015 mammals were found in following proportion: Apodemus sp. - 52, 8 %, Microtus agrestis - 25, 1 %, Microtus sp. - 8, 0 %, Sorex araneus - 3, 0 %, Clethrionomys glareolus - 2, 7 %, Microtus arvalis - 2, 0 %, Muscardinus avellanarius - 0, 6 %, Sorex minutus - 0, 5 %, Micromys minutus - 0, 1 % and birds in proportion: Turdus philomelos - 0, 4 %, Phylloscopus sp. - 0, 4 %, Aegolius funereus - 0, 2 %, Erithacus rubecula - 0, 2 %, Pyrrhula pyrrhula - 0, 2 %, Fringilla coelebs - 0, 1 %, Parus major - 0, 1 %, Anthus trivialis - 0, 1 %, Carduelis cannabina - 0, 1 %, Ficedula sp. - 0, 1 %, Garrulus landarius - 0, 1 %, Regulus regulus - 0, 1 %, Sylvia atricapilla - 0, 1 %, Turdus merula - 0, 1 %. Main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate proportion of voles and birds in diet during study reflecting timing of Tengmalm s Owl s nesting. During two years evaluation was proved difference in proportion of birds in diet of Tengmalm s Owl. In 2014 birds represented 15, 3 % of diet while in 2015 birds were not represented at all. Proportion of voles (Microtus agrestis, Microtus arvalis and Microtus sp.) in Tengmalm s Owl s diet <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> differ significantly during study period. It was found that in 2014 neither proportion of voles nor birds in Tengmalm s Owl s diet <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> change significantly during nesting period thus the effect of nesting timing on diet content wasn t proved. During 2015 nesting period the proportions of voles in Tengmalm s Owl s diet significantly grew and impact of nesting timing was proved.

40|$|The {{following}} {{thesis is}} an interdisciplinary analysis which follows {{the process of}} death and dying in Norway during the High Middle Ages post quem c. 1150 and terminus ante quem c. 1350; or roughly between {{the establishment of the}} archbishopric of Niðaróss and the onset of the pandemic Black Plague. The extant law texts from the four Norwegian law things are used as my primary sources in comparison with the regulations accorning to canon law. I also use examples from archaeology and the contemporary sagas. Medieval death was not defined by a terminating biological moment. This thesis follows the rites of spiritual and material preparations which often began with the onset of physical illness or even the occassional fortuitous visionary premonition warned of death s proximity. The first of such preparations was baptism. To die well was to die prepared. When death struck, the funerary rite proper began and continued until the body was incorporated into consecrated space. And finally, with the body interred, rituals extended from the grave in the form of commemoration. Arguably, the living were {{in the service of the}} dead during the Middle Ages.

40|$|Horizontal wells {{covering}} {{entire length}} of the reservoirs are not economically suitable. Frictional pressure drops increases with the increase in well length and flow rates. Optimal Horizontal length is estimated through economic analysis i. e. Net present Value of the project (NPV). Well construction costs including incremental costs of drilling horizontal section, friction losses in horizontal section, Hydrocarbon prices and Drainage area affect NPV. This thesis work estimates NPV and Productivity Indices of horizontal well projects with the use of simulation results under operating conditions of draw drawdown limits and constant Bottom hole flowing pressures using Finite conductivity concept. Horizontal wells assuming frictionless wellbores are also discussed. The results of NPV and PI are used to estimate the optimal length of horizontal wellbore in this work. Relatively shorter well lengths were found to be more economical than the lengthier ones in every case. Well bore flow rates of 1600 stb/day in the case of well bore roughness variation <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> decrease productivity to high extent. Higher flow rates such as a minimum of 2600 stb/day were reported to be involved in decreasing productivity for well lengths of 3000 - 4000 ft. for diameter of 2. 5 inches.

40|$|Objectives: to {{describe}} the characteristics, treatment and outcome of critically ill patients with influenza A(H 1 N 1) infection at St Pierre Hospital in Reunion island during the 2009 outbreak, {{as well as the}} measures of care reorganization implemented to face them. Patients and methods: prospective observational study of probable and confirmed cases of influenza A (H 1 N 1) / 2009 infection concerning hospitalized patients in a polyvalent intensive care unit (ICU). Results: Thirteen patients have been included between August and September 2009. Three (23 %) <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> have any medical history. The median age was 42 [22 - 69]. Eleven have required pulmonary ventilation for 10. 3 days (+/- 8). Three (23 %) have developed an ARDS. Three patients (23 %) died. To cope with the influx of cases and considering our situation of geographic isolation, it has been needed to totally rework the organization of care: set-up of a specific welcoming channel, division into sectors of the department, opening of additional beds, new on-duty assignment, inter and intra hospital cooperation. Conclusion: Reunion Island has been an experimental lab of crisis management during the H 1 N 1 / 2009 epidemic, several months ahead of the mother country. To anticipate the reorganization of care in intensive care units during an outbreak period, particularly in small units or units isolated like ours, looks to us a must so to quietly face a sharp influx of patients.

40|$|There is a {{tradition}} in vocational education which emphasizes teaching technical knowledge and skills while neglecting the development of attitudes and social skills which {{have been shown to}} be important causes of problems for office workers. The terms in general use to identify these skills and attitudes are work adjustment and occupational adjustment. Borow calls them 2 ̆ 2 [...] . the work ethos, a set of attitudes, rules of etiquette, and interpersonal skills involving relations with fellow workers, supervisors, and clients. 2 ̆ 2 He goes on to say that: It is astonishing to what degree the school and the community assume that any student who is making the transition from school to employment has somehow mastered work protocol and the repertoire of unwritten and formal, yet highly critical, situational skills. It may be noted, parenthetically, that among culturally disadvantaged youth it is the utter lack of an acceptable work ethos quite as fully as inadequate training in the formal duties of the job that makes the work situation seem so bewildering and terrifying and which so frequently predisposes such novices to almost certain failure. (Borow, 1969, p. 1) The opinion stated above also appears in the writings of people who are responsible for Manpower Development and Training Programs. A study conducted by Pucel (1968) showed that MDTA trainees in Minnesota feel skill development to be very important. There was less agreement regarding the responsibility to build desirable work-related attitudes. The need for information about the personal qualities and characteristics of MOTA trainees is illustrated by the following excerpt from an article in Business Education World: This is the MDTA girl [...] the one we know. We know she has enrolled in the MDTA class, that she has some typing background, that she possesses the qualifications for success as a secretary and that she wants to be trained in this program.

I never met with an organizing committee or {{spoke at a}} mass meeting when I <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> remind workers of something we all understand intuitively: There is one way {{you get what you}} need and want in this world—power. There are only two ways to get it—lots of money or lots of people organized together. Working people have never gotten anything except when they were organized and moving. The most important questions we in Atlanta deal with everyday are: How do we build power? How do we exercise power in a way that helps us build more power? We believe mass action, in all its many forms, is {{the most effective way to}} exercise power. We believe mass action actually helps build more power. American trade unionists operate in an environment that is full of constraints on our activity. Our private sector organizing is constrained by the NLRB. Our membership service is dictated by a contract. We often ask our attorneys to sign off on union activities. We double-check our 2 ̆ 2 public approval ratings. 2 ̆ 2 We accept these constraints for a variety of reasons both good and bad. But where we accept these constraints absolutely, we limit our ability to build and exercise power and, therefore, our effectiveness as trade unions. The only real tool we have is the strength of our membership. Any time the labor movement or any individual union in our country has grown or won substantial gains has been when members have been moving in mass action.
