5|$|The lower {{areas of}} the {{wilderness}} area are covered by a taiga forest of Scots pine. Less common trees include downy birch, goat willow, aspen and rowan. Logging {{in the past has}} mostly occurred in the southern part ("Kessi"), a large proportion of Vätsäri's forests being old-growth forests. The barren soil makes for poor growth conditions and most of the <b>ground</b> <b>vegetation</b> in the forests is subshrubs. One area with limestone rock features green spleenwort. The reserve is located in an area between a western and eastern vegetation zones, giving rise to unique combinations of species, such as Siberian spruce and red cottongrass.|$|E
5|$|Carrington Moss is a lowland raised bog. The area drains slowly, which {{slows the}} {{decomposition}} of plant life {{and leads to}} the accumulation of peat. Over thousands of years this raises the level of peat and forms a gently sloping dome (hence, raised). Such areas support {{a wide range of}} flora and fauna; Sphagnum balticum, a medium-sized bog moss, was recorded on Carrington Moss in the 1880s, although locally it is now presumed to be extinct. Lancashire- or bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba), cranberries, bog-rosemary (Andromeda polifolia), and the cotton sedge have also been recorded. In 1923 species of trees recorded by E. Price Evans for the Journal of Ecology included English oak (Quercus robur), and common ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Undergrowth included common hazel (Corylus avellana), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), and European holly (Ilex aquifolium). Several species of <b>ground</b> <b>vegetation</b> included creeping soft grass (Holcus mollis), common bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), common foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), iris (Iris pseudacorus), mad-dog weed (Alisma plantago-aquatica), and cat-o'-nine-tails (Typha latifolia).|$|E

It requires dense <b>ground</b> <b>vegetation</b> as well as standing water for bathing.|$|E
500|$|The {{terrain of}} the {{battlefield}} was nothing that Xerxes and his forces were accustomed to. Although coming from a mountainous country, the Persians were not prepared for the real nature of the country they had invaded. The pure ruggedness of this area is caused by torrential downpours for four months of the year, combined with an intense summer season of scorching heat that cracks the <b>ground.</b> <b>Vegetation</b> is scarce and consists of low, thorny shrubs. The hillsides along the pass are covered in thick brush, with some plants reaching [...] high.

2500|$|The main {{ecological}} factor driving the local distribution of species is the vertical stratification of the environment: in woodland a continuous change in species assemblages {{can be observed}} from tree canopies to <b>ground</b> <b>vegetation</b> then to plant litter down to deeper soil horizons. This is a complex factor embracing both nutritional and physiological requirements, together with behavioural trends, dispersal limitation and probable species interactions. Some species {{have been shown to}} exhibit negative or positive gravitropism, which adds a behavioural dimension to this still poorly understood vertical segregation. Experiments with peat samples turned upside down showed two types of responses to disturbance of this vertical gradient, called [...] "stayers" [...] and [...] "movers".|$|E
2500|$|The {{reindeer}} species 'Rangifer tarandus', {{of which}} Rangifer tarandus caribou is a subspecies, is a medium-sized ungulate which inhabits boreal, montane, and arctic environments, and exhibits [...] "tremendous variation in ecology, genetics, behaviour and morphology." [...] Most of the subspecies, Rangifer tarandus caribou are now only found in Canada. A distinctive characteristic of all caribou is large crescent-shaped hooves that change shape with {{the season and}} that are adapted to walking in snow-covered and soft ground such as swamps and peat lands, and assist in digging through snow to forage on lichens and other <b>ground</b> <b>vegetation.</b> The subspecies ecotype, boreal woodland caribou, have a shoulder height of approximately 1.0-1.2 m shoulder height and weigh 110–210kg.|$|E
2500|$|However, most British coppices {{have not}} been managed in this way for many decades. The coppice stems have grown tall (the coppice {{is said to be}} [...] ), forming a heavily shaded {{woodland}} of many closely spaced stems with little <b>ground</b> <b>vegetation.</b> [...] The open-woodland animals survive in small numbers along woodland rides or not at all, and many of these once-common species have become rare. Overstood coppice is a habitat of relatively low biodiversity—it does not support the open-woodland species, but neither does it support many of the characteristic species of high forest, because it lacks many high-forest features such as substantial dead-wood, clearings and stems of varied ages. Suitable conservation management of these abandoned coppices may be to restart coppice management, or in some cases it may be more appropriate to use singling and selective clearance to establish a high-forest structure.|$|E

40|$|South east Queensland's booming {{population}} {{is creating a}} range of challenges for Main Roads. Traffic volumes in the metropolitan region are increasing {{by an average of}} 3. 5 percent per annum (rolling average for the past five years), contributing to an increase in road traffic noise. Road traffic noise may affect community lifestyles, so the department is keen to identify whether or not its noise calculation model is predicting higher or lower noise levels than actually occur over various <b>ground</b> and <b>vegetation</b> types. The type of <b>ground</b> or <b>vegetation</b> surface which sound (generated by traffic on a roadway) propagates over has an effect on the level of noise attenuation with increasing distance from the sources. Main Roads is interested in determining the attenuation of road traffic noise due to ground surface type, particularly for typical Australian bush. Main Roads uses a United Kingdom methodology known as CoRTN (Calculation of Road Traffic Noise) to calculate road traffic noise. This model considers attenuation due to distance. However, there may be significant differences in the level of road traffic noise attenuation between the physical environments of England's <b>ground</b> and <b>vegetation</b> types and Australia's <b>ground</b> and <b>vegetation</b> types. This research project will aim to identify whether a correction factor for the L 10 (1 h) and L 10 (18 hour) noise descriptors is needed for CoRTN, helping to ensure the noise predictions and calculations undertaken by Main Roads are suited to south east Queensland conditions...|$|R
