We found an asymptotic positive association between resource addition and species richness, and an interaction between resource addition and species identity on cricket abundance, which indicates differential effects of resource addition among cricket species. Our results indicate that 12 of the 13 cricket species present in forest litter are maintained at low densities by resource scarcity; this highlights sugar-rich resource as a short-term driver of litter cricket community structure in tropical forests. When resource was experimentally increased, species richness increased due to behavioral displacement. We present evidence that the density of many species is limited by resource scarcity and, when resources are added, behavioral displacement promotes increased species packing and alters species composition. Further, our findings have technical applicability for increasing sampling efficiency of local cricket diversity in studies aiming to estimate species richness, but with no regard to local environmental drivers or species-abundance characteristics...|$|R

5000|$|The Vietnam War had {{significant}} environmental implications {{by the use}} of chemical agents to destroy military significant vegetation. Enemies found an advantage in remaining invisible by blending into a civilian population or by taking cover in dense vegetation and opposing armies targeted natural ecosystems. The US military used “more than 20 million gallons of herbicides, were sprayed by the US to defoliate forests, clear growth along the borders of military sites and eliminate enemy crops.” [...] The chemical agents gave the US an advantage in wartime efforts. However, the vegetation was unable to regenerate and left behind bare mudflats even years after spraying. Not only was the vegetation affected, but also the wildlife: “a mid-1980s study by Vietnamese ecologists documented just 24 species of birds and 5 species of mammals present in <b>sprayed</b> <b>forests</b> and converted areas, compared to 145-170 bird species and 30-55 kinds of mammals in intact forest.” [...] The uncertain long-term effects of these herbicides are now being discovered by looking at modified species distribution patterns through habitat degradation and loss in wetland systems, which absorbed the runoff from the mainland. The Rwandan genocide led to the killing of roughly 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The war created a massive migration of nearly 2 million Hutus fleeing Rwanda over the course of just a few weeks to refugee camps in Tanzania and now modern day Democratic Republic of the Congo. This large displacement of people in refugee camps put pressure on the surrounding ecosystem. Forests were cleared in order to provide wood for building shelters and creating cooking fires: “these people suffered from harsh conditions and constituted an important threat impact to natural resources.” Consequences from the conflict also included the degradation of National Parks and Reserves.

40|$|This is a draft {{conservation}} assessment {{designed to}} provide a synopsis of the life history, ecology, and management and conservation concerns of the Bay-breasted Warbler (Dendroica castanea). The primary focus of this conservation assessment is on information relevant to Region 9 of the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service. The Bay-breasted Warbler is a neotropical migrant that inhabits boreal coniferous forests in a broad band, primarily, across central and eastern Canada. It breeds in northern spruce-fir forests, feeding and nesting in the dense foliage of these conifers. It winters in Panama and northern South America. Males and females are fairly large relative to other members of the genus Dendroica, being 13 to 14 cm long and weighing about 13 g. Bay-breasted Warbler numbers have been reported to dramatically increase and decrease in synchrony with outbreaks and declines of the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), a key food item. Its North American breeding distribution is closely correlated with that of spruce and fir in the boreal forest. The greatest threat to the breeding range of the Bay-breasted Warbler is the reduction in the area of old-growth spruce and fir of the boreal forest. Both nesting habitat and food supply (spruce budworm) are at risk when reductions or alterations of these <b>forest</b> areas occurs. <b>Spraying</b> insecticides to control spruce budworm can have direct toxic affect on this Warbler (inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase activity). Winter habitat degradation and loss is also a threat, as commercial and residential development activity continues to reduce the forested habitats in the tropics. No specific or dedicated management activities have been attempted for the Bay-breasted Warbler in Region 9. If management activities are developed and implemented, they should address ecological sustainability. No past or current conservation activities in Region 9 are known to be relevant to the Bay-breasted Warbler. However, the adoption of an ecosystemcentered forest management perspective within Region 9 would likely help conserve inconspicuous boreal birds such as the Bay-breasted Warbler. No surveying, monitoring or research specific to the Bay-breasted Warbler has occurred or is occurring within the national forests of Region 9, although some generalized bird monitoring is occurring. Modifications to a point-count survey protocol could improve the monitoring of Bay-breasted Warblers in national forests. Considering the limited extent of its habitat within these forests, its migratory behavior and inconspicuous nature, declines in the abundance of Bay-breasted Warblers in Region 9 forests could easily be overlooked...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1960 More than {{one-fourth of}} the forest land in the Pacific Northwest is growing timber at reduced {{capacity}} {{as the result of}} brush encroachment. Increasing use of chemicals in brush control requires that more information be available regarding their use. Bigleaf maple, Oregon oak and vine maple are among the more noxious brush species in the Willamette Valley area. This thesis summarizes the progress which has been made in the control of these species by the Forest Research Division. Aerial sprays have been found satisfactory in many areas for broadcast spraying of low brush cover. Basal sprays and ground level foliage sprays are used on weed trees and tall brush. Topography is also a major consideration in choice of method. Effectiveness of the herbicide is determined by climate, season, species, specific chemical, formulation, diluent, concentration, and many unknown factors. Most of the treatments in this project were applied to individual stems. Many of the tests were established in order to find the most effective chemical for a given situation; others expand on information gained in earlier trials. On large trees, applications were made both basally and in frills; also in bands around the boles at breast height with paste type herbicides. Smaller shrubs were treated with foliage sprays, dormant cane sprays, and individual stem sprays. The treatments were located on Bureau of Land Management land near Scio, Oregon, and in the McDonald <b>Forest.</b> Aerial <b>spray</b> projects conducted by the Bureau of Land Management in the Cascades and in the Coast Range have been included in these observations. Bigleaf maple was killed very successfully with basal sprays of 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) in oil in a mixture of 32 ahg. It is very likely that much lower dosages will prove adequate. Maple stems up to eight inches d. b. h. were well controlled with 2, 4, 5 -T applied in a similar manner. Girdling has not proved to be an adequate method of control because of basal resprouting and delayed top-kill. Frilling followed with a dilute spray (22 ahg) of 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) in kerosene gave good control. However, the cost of application is higher than for a similar basal spray. Paste herbicides were largely rather ineffective except for kilbrush applied in September. Oregon oak has proven more difficult to kill with basal sprays than maple. However, 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) and 2, 4 -D amine in frills have both provided complete top killing. 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) gave the better sprout control. Kilbrush gave good results on small stems when applied in August. Scarification of the bark prior to treatment proved to be the most dependable method. Vine maple has been top-killed by 2, 4, 5 -T, 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) and brushkiller mixtures in many forms and concentrations. Sprouting has not been controlled completely by any of these but 2, 4, 5 -T is the most effective in this respect. Aerial sprays of four pounds per acre of 2, 4, 5 -T in some cases have caused nearly complete top-kill, and considerable sprout retardation. Snowbrush has been completely killed by 2, 4, 5 -T with foliage and with step sprays. A Bureau of Land Management aerial spray project using four pounds per acre of 2, 4, 5 -T gave 100 per cent kill of this species. Cherry, elderberry, thimbleberry, poison oak and madrone can be effectively top-killed with 2, 4, 5 -T as basal or foliage spray. Sprout control has been relatively poor on most of these species. Grass competition to young seedlings can be reduced with several chemicals. Tree survival is consistently higher, however, when the minimum amount of grass herbicide is applied which will reduce grass density to approximately 60 per cent of normal. Soil sterilization reduces tree survival. The use of herbicides as a forest management tool has increased rapidly in recent years. Public acceptance of the value of this tool and further refinements in techniques can provide much needed relief for the brush problem in out forests...|$|R
