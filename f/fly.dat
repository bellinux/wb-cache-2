Bart comes out the other end, now with his head back on his real body. Homer then pulls out an axe and angrily chases Bart for using the device.|$|E

5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of <b>fly</b> that have larvae that attack the plants, {{narcissus}} bulb <b>fly</b> Merodon equestris, and {{two species of}} hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. The flies lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female <b>fly</b> being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult <b>fly</b> emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the common swift moth) attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|E
5|$|Beetles' flight {{wings are}} crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and stored below the elytra. A fold (jugum) of the {{membrane}} {{at the base}} of each wing is characteristic. Some beetles have lost the ability to <b>fly.</b> These include some ground beetles (Carabidae) and some true weevils (Curculionidae), as well as desert- and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few families, both the ability to <b>fly</b> and the elytra have been lost, as in the glow-worms (Phengodidae), where the females resemble larvae throughout their lives. The presence of elytra and wings does not always indicate that the beetle will <b>fly.</b> For example, the tansy beetle walks between habitats despite being physically capable of flight.|$|E

5|$|Braathens SAFE {{was also}} {{given the right}} to <b>fly</b> its first {{international}} scheduled flights {{for the first time}} in several decades. On 19 August 1988, the airline was granted concession to <b>fly</b> to Billund in Denmark. At the same time, Air-X was granted concession to <b>fly</b> the route via Sandefjord and Skien. The route started on 2 May 1989. Previously the rules stated that if SAS flew to a non-Scandinavian destination from any capital, no other Scandinavian airlines could <b>fly</b> to that city. Braathens SAFE lost many contracts in the charter market in 1990, following Scanair's purchase of larger Douglas DC-10 aircraft. On 18 May 1990, Braathens SAFE was awarded the concession a route from Oslo, Bergen and Stavanger to Newcastle, which opened on 3 April 1991. The airline was also awarded the route from Tromsø to Murmansk, Russia, once per week from 28 January 1993.|$|E

5|$|Flies {{appear in}} popular culture in {{concepts}} such as fly-on-the-wall documentary-making in film and television production. The metaphoric name suggests that events are seen candidly, as a <b>fly</b> might see them. Flies have inspired the design of miniature flying robots. Steven Spielberg's 1993 film Jurassic Park relied {{on the idea that}} DNA could be preserved in the stomach contents of a blood-sucking <b>fly</b> fossilised in amber, though the mechanism has been discounted by scientists.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{are capable}} of great {{manoeuvrability}} during flight due {{to the presence of}} the halteres. These act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to <b>fly.</b> The wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the <b>fly</b> to turn sideways. The wings of the <b>fly</b> are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control.|$|E
5|$|Flies tend to <b>fly</b> in a {{straight}} line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the <b>fly</b> observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the <b>fly</b> heads off in a new direction.|$|E
