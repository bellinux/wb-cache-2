25|$|The <b>key</b> <b>loss</b> for the Buccaneers was {{standout}} DE {{and former}} second round pick, Dewayne White who left {{to sign with}} his former DL coach, the current {{head coach of the}} Detroit Lions, Rod Marinelli.|$|E
50|$|The Hawkeyes led {{virtually}} the entire game, but needed a huge defensive stop in the closing minutes, with Jr. linebacker Chad Greenway stopping Marion Barber III for a <b>key</b> <b>loss</b> on 2nd down in Iowa territory and eventually forcing Minnesota to attempt a 51-yard field goal, trailing by two. Although Gopher placekicker Rhyss Lloyd had won three games in his career with last-minute field goals, this time his attempt shanked wide.|$|E
50|$|Injuries were a {{major factor}} in the outcome of this game, but despite only {{dressing}} 45 of its players for the game, the Wolfpack managed to come on top over the Pirates, who fell to 3-1 overall. The <b>key</b> <b>loss</b> of Defensive Linebacker Quentin Cotton, and the two missed touchdown opportunities in the red zone for the Pirates would lead to an Overtime showdown as the score was tied at the last second, 24-24.|$|E
50|$|Bill Middlekauff, a fullback {{who played}} on the 1923 and 1924 teams, {{returned}} to the squad. <b>Key</b> <b>losses</b> {{from the previous year}} included Edgar C. Jones.|$|R

50|$|Tony Martin (to London) and Brett Kimmorley (to Northern Eagles) were <b>key</b> <b>losses</b> for {{the club}} in the lead up to 2001 which were {{slightly}} off-set {{by the arrival of}} half-back Matt Orford and winger Junior Langi.|$|R
5000|$|During the 2011 season, Mayagüez were {{determined}} {{to turn things around}} and forget their horrendous 2010 season. They signed Venezuela's national team player, Héctor [...] "Pepito" [...] Romero as their key addition. Also added were some role players such as Eric Rodríguez and Héctor Valenzuela during the off season. They selected Carlos Rivera from a special draft from Leones de Ponce and former Siena player Edwin Ubiles in the BSN's new players Draft. Their <b>key</b> <b>loss</b> was townsman Alex Galindo, to the Gallitos de Isabela.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, if Microsoft failed {{to think about}} the {{consequences}} of <b>key</b> <b>loss</b> and created a first key without using secret splitting (and did so in secure hardware which doesn't allow protection to be weakened after key generation), and the NSA pointed out this problem as part of the review process, it might explain why Microsoft weakened their scheme with a second key and why the new one was called _NSAKEY. (The second key might be backed up using secret splitting, so losing both keys needn't be a problem.) ...|$|E
50|$|The 2010 general {{election}} saw the incumbent Alliance for Sweden coalition returned to power, though it lost its {{majority in the}} Riksdag and had to continue as a minority government. The coalition relied on ad hoc support from the opposition to pass legislation, particularly the Green Party. Immigration critics Sweden Democrats entered the Riksdag {{for the first time}} in 2010 and was an isolated part of the opposition, in many cases voting with the government when the two blocs were divided. The Alliance got its budget passed on all occasions, but suffered a <b>key</b> <b>loss</b> when the opposition 'took out' a passage regarding the increased cutoff for when state income tax should be paid in late 2013.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the second}} year in a row, LSU had more underclassmen declare for the NFL Draft than any other team in the country. [...] <b>Key</b> <b>losses</b> {{included}} Mettenberger, third-team All American Odell Beckham Jr., and second-team All-SEC players Jarvis Landry, Jeremy Hill, Anthony Johnson, and Lamin Barrow.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the end of}} the season, LSU lost {{numerous}} {{players to}} the NFL Draft, including ten underclassmen, the most of any other team. <b>Key</b> <b>losses</b> included second-team All Americans Kevin Minter and Eric Reid, third-team All American Sam Montgomery, and second-team All-SEC players Barkevious Mingo and Drew Alleman.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the season, the Hawkeyes {{looked to}} replace seven {{offensive}} starters and four defensive starters. <b>Key</b> <b>losses</b> from 2003 included Maurice Brown, Robert Gallery, Nate Chandler, Fred Russell, and Ramon Ochoa on offense.

50|$|A {{team with}} the squad and budget of Deportes Savio {{obviously}} won't compete for the title. This does not stop them from causing harm to other clubs with greater aspiration. They will be playing their home matches on an unfamiliar field: Stadium Roberto Martinéz Ávila in Siguatepeque, since their stadium is being remodeled. A <b>key</b> <b>loss</b> for the team is the Brazilian Edilson Pereira who signed with Platense. On the other hand, important arrivals include goalie Hugo Caballero, the midfielders Marco Antonio Mejía and Elmer Marín, and forward Edgar Núñez. Deportes Savio will seek to grab points early on to avoid suffering like the previous tournament and with that seek, maybe not the playoff rounds, but their permanency in the league.|$|E

She was largely self-educated in her father's library, but gleaned from it and his occasional tutelage an interest in history and literature. She claimed that a <b>key</b> <b>loss</b> of not having attending a school was that she did not learn the art of defending herself. From a young age, Betham would recite poetry and was a voracious reader of plays and history. She was sent out for sewing lessons [...] "to prevent my too strict application to books."

40|$|Encryption <b>key</b> <b>loss</b> {{problem is}} the Achilles's heel of cryptography. Key escrow helps, but favors disclosures. Schemes for {{recoverable}} encryption keys through noised secret sharing alleviate the dilemma. Key owner escrows a specifically encrypted backup. The recovery needs a large cloud. Cloud cost, money trail should rarefy illegal attempts. We now propose noised secret sharing schemes supporting discounts. The recovery request with discount code lowers the recovery complexity, easily by orders of magnitude. A smaller cloud may suffice for the same recovery timing. Alternatively, same cloud may provide faster recovery etc. Our schemes appear useful for users attracted to Big Data, but afraid of possibly humongous consequences of the <b>key</b> <b>loss</b> or data disclosure...|$|E

In the current signature scheme, {{if we are not}} aware of lost key, then, an impersonator can generate as many signatures as he/she wants. Furthermore this problem can cause great damages to us. Therefore, it is important to construct a signature scheme strong against key exposure problem. But it is an open problem to find a practical signature scheme with resistance to <b>key</b> <b>loss</b> problem...|$|E
30|$|Cryptographic {{keys and}} {{anonymous}} transactions make blockchain vulnerable to account takeover and digital identity theft because an identity is protected only by its private <b>key.</b> <b>Loss</b> {{of a key}} means loss of identity on the network. One solution is to build an identity and reputation system using a blockchain that records “fingerprint” events (Baxter 2016; Nordseth 2016). Instead of recording the personal identifiers customarily used offline (e.g., social security number, birth certificate, passport), the blockchain may track life events (e.g., births, schooling, acquiring student loans, opening bank accounts, buying cars, or purchasing homes). These events recorded in the irreversible identity blockchain become a digital identity {{that is difficult to}} steal because it is unforgeable, time-stamped, and publically monitored.|$|E
30|$|The rest of {{this paper}} is {{organised}} as follows. Section 2 defines the problem setting, solution requirements, and prior approaches from the literature. In Section 3 we describe our solution and discuss its properties, while Section 4 extends it to allow recovery from <b>key</b> <b>losses.</b> Section 5 describes our prototype implementation, with experimental results presented in Section 6, and the paper concludes in Section 7 with pointers to future work.|$|R
25|$|The Irish lost {{a number}} of players on defense {{including}} four former starting defensive backs, three players on the defensive line, including defensive end Justin Tuck, and two former starting linebackers, including honorable mention All-American Derek Curry, to graduation. On the offensive {{side of the ball}} the only <b>key</b> <b>losses</b> for the Irish were running back Ryan Grant and former quarterback and wide receiver Carlyle Holiday. The Irish returned ten starters on offense and four on defense.|$|R
50|$|Newtown looked set for {{back-to-back}} titles {{after finishing}} as minor premiers. Both Newtown and Balmain won their respective semi-finals with the Bluebags blitzing St George by 55 points to 7, {{which was to}} remain the Dragons’ largest losing margin until 1994. However injuries and war duties then ravaged the side including the <b>key</b> <b>losses</b> of Len Smith and Herb Narvo who had starred for them all season. Balmain thus overcame Newtown 19-16 in the Final, enabling Newtown a “right of challenge”.|$|R
40|$|International audienceEncryption key {{safety is}} the Achilles’ heel of cryptography. Backup copies with the escrow offset {{the risk of}} <b>key</b> <b>loss,</b> but {{increase}} the danger of disclosure. We propose Recoverable Encryption (RE) schemes which alleviate the dilemma. The backup is encrypted so that the recovery is possible in prac-tice only over a large cloud. A 10 K-node cloud may recover a key in at most 10 minutes, with the 5 minutes average. Same attempt at the escrow’s site, a com-puter or perhaps a cluster, could require 70 days with the 35 days average. Large clouds are now affordable. Their illegal use is unlikely. We show feasi-bility of two schemes with their application potential...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} calculation, {{modelling}} {{and interpretation of}} efficiency maps for electrical machines. The efficiency maps are calculated using a finite-element based mapping of losses, torque and flux-linkage {{as a function of}} the d- and q-axis currents and speed. For modelling efficiency maps, it is shown that a number of <b>key</b> <b>loss</b> types can be described in the form Tmωn. The effect of each of these losses on the shape of the efficiency map is then explored. It is found that practical efficiency maps can be approximated using a series of such terms which leads to a better understanding of the losses in the machine. The above results are validated using the loss and efficiency maps of three example machine...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} public-key {{infrastructure}} research explore the tradeoff between decreased trust in Certificate Authorities (CAs), resilience against attacks, communication overhead (bandwidth and latency) {{for setting up}} an SSL/TLS connection, and availability with respect to verifiability of public key information. In this paper, we propose AKI as a new public-key validation infrastructure, to reduce the level of trust in CAs. AKI integrates an architecture for key revocation of all entities (e. g., CAs, domains) with an architecture for accountability of all infrastructure parties through checks-and-balances. AKI efficiently handles common certification operations, and gracefully handles catastrophic events such as domain <b>key</b> <b>loss</b> or compromise. We propose AKI to make progress towards a public-key validation infrastructure with key revocation that reduces trust in any single entity...|$|E

40|$|A {{rotating}} spool compressor {{is a novel}} compressor {{technology that}} was recently introduced by Kemp et al. (2008). To accelerate {{the development of the}} technology, a breakdown of the <b>key</b> <b>losses</b> within the device is presented. The losses include flow losses associated with leakage and over/under compression due to valves and porting. Additionally, frictional losses associated with the key sealing elements and moving components are calculated. All of these losses are combined into Pareto of losses for the spool compressor. This Pareto identifies the dynamic sealing elements as key components to continue development on to achieve the best improvement in efficiency...|$|R
30|$|One of the {{well-known}} challenges relating the effective usage of encryption {{in the cloud}} is key management. According to the Cloud Security Alliance, three main imperatives need to be met [17]. The first concerns {{the security of the}} key stores in order to avoid compromising all encrypted data. Then comes the actual policing of the access to those keys; to ensure only legitimate users get access to the keys, and the implementation of a clear policy to ensure keys are not stored by the entity meant to be using them. Finally, ensure that safe backups exist for data recovery in case of <b>key</b> <b>loss.</b> Nonetheless there are signs that things are moving on that side as the advancement on order preserving encryption and database systems have facilitate the emergence of application where the cryptographic key remains at the client [52].|$|E
40|$|In nanostructured thin films, photogenerated charge {{carriers}} {{can access}} the surface {{more easily than}} in dense films and thus react more readily. However, the high surface area of these films has also been associated with enhanced recombination losses via surface states. We herein use transient absorption spectroscopy to compare the ultrafast charge carrier kinetics in dense and nanostructured TiO 2 films for its two most widely used polymorphs: anatase and rutile. We find that nanostructuring does not enhance recombination rates on ultrafast timescales, indicating that surface state mediated recombination is not a <b>key</b> <b>loss</b> pathway for either TiO 2 polymorph. Rutile shows faster, and less intensity-dependent recombination than anatase, which we assign to its higher doping density. For both polymorphs, we conclude that bulk rather than surface recombination is the primary determinant of charge carrier lifetime...|$|E
40|$|Android’s trust-on-first-use {{application}} signing model asso-ciates developers with a fixed signing key, but lacks a mecha-nism to transparently {{update the}} key or renew their signing certificate. As an advantage, this feature allows applica-tion updates {{to be recognized}} as authorized by a party with access to the original signing key. Changing keys or cer-tificates requires that end-users manually uninstall/reinstall apps, losing all non-backed up user data. In this paper, we show that with appropriate OS support, developers can securely and without user intervention transfer signing au-thority to a new signing key. Our proposal, Baton, modifies Android’s app installation framework enabling key agility while preserving backwards compatibility with current apps and current Android releases. Baton is designed to work consistently with current UID sharing and signature permis-sion requirements. We discuss the technical changes made to Android, and remaining open issues such as <b>key</b> <b>loss</b> and signing authority revocation on Android...|$|E
50|$|Czechoslovakia overcame {{tragedy to}} win their second world {{championship}} and ninth European Championship. In November 1948 six Czechoslovak players (Ladislav Troják, Karel Stibor, Zdeněk Jarkovský, Vilibald Šťovík, Miloslav Pokorný and defenseman Zdeněk Švarc) were lost when their plane went missing crossing the English Channel. Despite the <b>key</b> <b>losses</b> to their roster, they defeated the Sudbury Wolves, Canada's representative, three to two. It was only the third defeat for the Canadians at a World Championship. The Americans were able to top the Czechoslovaks in the final round, which earned them a bronze medal, and kept the host Swedes off the podium.|$|R
