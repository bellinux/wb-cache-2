5|$|During {{the first}} centuries AD, Palmyra's main trade route ran {{east to the}} Euphrates where it {{connected}} at the city of Hīt. The route then ran south along the river toward the port of Charax Spasinu on the Persian Gulf, where Palmyrene ships traveled {{back and forth to}} India. <b>Goods</b> <b>were</b> imported from India, China and Transoxiana, and exported west to Emesa (or Antioch) then the Mediterranean ports, from which they were distributed throughout the Roman Empire. In addition to the usual route some Palmyrene merchants used the Red Sea, probably {{as a result of the}} Roman–Parthian Wars. <b>Goods</b> <b>were</b> carried overland from the seaports to a Nile port, and then taken to the Egyptian Mediterranean ports for export. Inscriptions attesting a Palmyrene presence in Egypt date to the reign of Hadrian.|$|E
5|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>were</b> {{loaded on}} flat barges that could carry several tons. It took about 18 hours {{for two or}} three men to pull a barge through the canal.|$|E
50|$|Complementary <b>goods</b> <b>are</b> a less extreme {{form of this}} effect. In this case, one <b>good</b> <b>is</b> {{still of}} value even if the other <b>good</b> <b>is</b> not obtained.|$|R
50|$|Unlike public <b>goods,</b> private <b>goods</b> <b>are</b> {{less likely}} to have the free rider problem. Assuming a private <b>good</b> <b>is</b> valued {{positively}} by everyone, the efficiency of obtaining the <b>good</b> <b>is</b> obstructed by its rivalry, that is simultaneous consumption of a rivalrous <b>good</b> <b>is</b> theoretically impossible; the feasibility of obtaining the <b>good</b> <b>is</b> made difficult by its excludability, that is people {{have to pay for it}} to enjoy its benefits.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, most {{transportation}} of goods in Indiana was done by river. Most of the state's estuaries drained into the Wabash River or the Ohio River, ultimately meeting up with the Mississippi River, where <b>goods</b> <b>were</b> transported to and sold in St. Louis or New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|A Viking funeral {{could be}} a {{considerable}} expense, but the barrow and the grave <b>goods</b> <b>were</b> not considered to have been wasted. In {{addition to being a}} homage to the deceased, the barrow remained as a monument to the social position of the descendants. Especially powerful Norse clans could demonstrate their position through monumental grave fields. The Borre mound cemetery in Vestfold is for instance connected to the Yngling dynasty, and it had large tumuli that contained stone ships.|$|E

5000|$|After {{discussing}} the basic <b>goods</b> it <b>is</b> argued {{that within the}} list there is no hierarchal order, as the basic <b>goods</b> <b>are</b> considered impossible to compare or measure. Finnis believes the <b>goods</b> <b>are</b> equally self-evident. Each of the basic <b>goods</b> can <b>be</b> considered the most important, as none {{of them can be}} reduced to simply a mechanism of achieving another. While technically the <b>goods</b> can <b>be</b> treated as superior to one another Finnis provides that each <b>good</b> <b>is</b> still fundamental where no priority value exists.|$|R

5|$|After {{the scale}} of the damage became clear, the {{government}} of Yemen requested for assistance from the international community. The hardest hit areas had poor infrastructure, which caused difficulties in communications as relief <b>goods</b> <b>were</b> distributed. Nations in the region, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, sent money and supplies to help rebuild the damaged infrastructure and houses. Agencies under the United Nations provided food and logistical support. Relief efforts continued to make progress until 2011 due to a political uprising in Yemen.|$|E
5|$|Common bronze items {{included}} domestic wares like oil lamps, incense burners, tables, irons, stoves, and dripping jars. Iron <b>goods</b> <b>were</b> {{often used for}} construction and farmwork, such as plowshares, pickaxes, spades, shovels, hoes, sickles, axes, adze, hammers, chisels, knives, saws, scratch awls, and nails. Iron was also used to make swords, halberds, arrowheads and scale armor for the military.|$|E
5|$|Han luxury items {{furnished}} {{the homes}} of wealthy merchants, officials, nobles, and royalty. Such <b>goods</b> <b>were</b> often highly decorated by skilled artisans. These include red-and-black lacquerwares in various shapes and sizes, bronze items such as raised-relief decorated mirrors, oil lamps {{in the shape of}} human figures, and gilded bronzewares, glazed ceramic wares with various incised designs, and ornaments and jewelry made of jade, opal, amber, quartz, gold, and silver.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the Great Depression, successive governments pursued a strategy designed to transform Argentina into a country self-sufficient in industry as well as agriculture. The strategy of growth was based on import substitution in which tariffs and quotas for final <b>goods</b> <b>were</b> raised. The import-substitution process had progressively been adopted since the late 19th century, but the Great Depression intensified it. The government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agriculture, and agricultural production fell dramatically.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Marco, the General Coordination of Civil Protection of the Ministry of the Interior {{declared}} a state of emergency for 48 municipalities in Veracruz. Relief <b>goods</b> <b>were</b> distributed to the affected areas by October9. The Government of Mexico reported that 4,700 blankets, 2,900 mattresses, 5,554 bottles of water (each containing 500milliliters), 260,000 boxes of milk, 250,000 packages of biscuits, and 12,400 boxes of school supplies had been distributed.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1851, a French {{cargo ship}} {{carrying}} 98 tons of goods from Gibraltar to Rabat capsized near {{the coast of}} Salé. A few tons of <b>goods</b> <b>were</b> rescued, and were stored {{in the city for}} safekeeping. Salé turned out to be less than safe, however; by the next day, hundreds of townspeople were scavenging and stealing the goods. The thieves were thwarted by , but only temporarily. By the end of the raids, the French had lost 11,391 franc germinals worth of goods.|$|E
50|$|Fungibility is {{different}} from liquidity. A <b>good</b> <b>is</b> said to be liquid {{if it can be}} easily exchanged for money or another <b>good.</b> A <b>good</b> <b>is</b> fungible if one unit of the <b>good</b> <b>is</b> substantially equivalent to another unit of the same good of the same quality {{at the same time and}} place.|$|R
50|$|Digital <b>goods</b> <b>are</b> {{software}} programs, music, videos {{or other}} electronic files that users download exclusively from the Internet. Some digital <b>goods</b> <b>are</b> free, others {{are available for}} a fee.

50|$|A public <b>good</b> <b>is</b> {{one that}} {{everyone}} enjoys non-exclusively such as national defense or clean water. A private <b>good</b> <b>is</b> a <b>good</b> that <b>is</b> enjoyed exclusively by a select few, usually within the winning coalition, and cannot be shared.

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{contributors}} to globalization was the Triangular Trade and how it connected the world. The Triangular Trade or Triangle Trade was a system used to connect three {{areas of the world}} through trade. Once traded, items and <b>goods</b> <b>were</b> shipped {{to other parts of the}} world, making the triangle trade a key to global trade. The Triangle Trade system was run by Europeans, increasing their global power.|$|E

Roughly 65% of ReTool's <b>goods</b> <b>were</b> {{purchased}} from people, while the remainder was purchased from factories that produced too many tools or from closing businesses. CEO John Morgan said in an October 2000 interview that many people did not sell tools they did not use so {{it was hard to}} accumulate used tools at ReTool. Winmark sold ReTool around 2002.|$|E
5|$|There {{has never}} been a railway to Mersea Island. During the railway mania of the mid-19th century, <b>goods</b> <b>were</b> transported by boat and barge. In 1911, local {{businessmen}} proposed a railway between Colchester and the island, which would have ended at a pier next to the Esplanade in the south, with an additional station in West Mersea on what is now East Road. The plans were abandoned due to the First World War.|$|E
5000|$|In economics, {{the terms}} “public good” and “common good” have {{technical}} definitions. A public <b>good</b> <b>is</b> a <b>good</b> that <b>is</b> non-rivalrous and non-excludable.

5|$|Thutmose I was, however, not {{destined to}} lie {{alongside}} his daughter after Hatshepsut's death. Thutmose III, Hatshepsut's successor, decided to reinter his grandfather {{in an even}} more magnificent tomb, KV38, which featured another yellow sarcophagus dedicated to Thutmose I and inscribed with texts which proclaimed this pharaoh's love for his deceased grandfather. Unfortunately, however, Thutmose I's remains would be disturbed late during the 20th dynasty when KV38 was plundered; the sarcophagus' lid was broken and all this king's valuable precious jewellery and grave <b>goods</b> <b>were</b> stolen.|$|E
5|$|What {{had begun}} as a Salt Satyagraha quickly {{grew into a}} mass Satyagraha. British cloth and <b>goods</b> <b>were</b> boycotted. Unpopular forest laws were defied in the Maharashtra, Karnataka and Central Provinces. Gujarati peasants refused to pay tax, under threat of losing their crops and land. In Midnapore, Bengalis took part by refusing to pay the chowkidar tax. The British responded with more laws, {{including}} censorship of correspondence and declaring the Congress and its associate organisations illegal. None of those measures slowed the civil disobedience movement.|$|E
5|$|After {{being kept}} in the Forbidden City for 27 days of mourning, on 3 March 1661 the emperor's corpse was transported in a lavish {{procession}} to Jingshan 景山 (a hillock {{just north of the}} Forbidden City), after which a large amount of precious <b>goods</b> <b>were</b> burned as funeral offerings. Only two years later, in 1653, was the body transported to its final resting place. Contrary to Manchu customs at the time, which usually dictated that a deceased person should be cremated, the Shunzhi Emperor was buried. He was interred in what later {{came to be known as}} the Eastern Qing Tombs, 125 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of Beijing, one of two Qing imperial cemeteries. His tomb is part of the Xiaoling (孝陵) mausoleum complex (known in Manchu as the Hiyoošungga Munggan), which was the first mausoleum to be erected on that site.|$|E
