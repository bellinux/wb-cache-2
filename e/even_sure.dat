Curtis then realised that, despite writing some funny lines, {{he had no idea how}} Rowan Atkinson was supposed to play his part. On the 25th anniversary documentary Blackadder Rides Again, Atkinson added that as the cameras were about to roll for the first time, he suddenly realised he wasn't <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> what voice to use for the character.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} the Hertz effect, the {{researches}} from the start showed a great complexity of the phenomenon of photoelectric fatigue — that is, the progressive diminution of the effect observed upon fresh metallic surfaces. According to an important research by Wilhelm Hallwachs, ozone played {{an important part in}} the phenomenon. However, other elements enter such as oxidation, the humidity, the mode of polish of the surface, etc. It was at the time not <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> that the fatigue is absent in a vacuum.|$|E
25|$|After {{getting off}} to 2–7 start, the Mavericks {{eventually}} found {{themselves with the}} sixth spot in the Western Conference playoff bracket for 2009 after going 50–32 (ninth consecutive 50+-win season) and about {{three to four weeks}} earlier, weren't <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> {{if they were going to}} make the eighth and final spot. But a run of 5–1 in their last six regular season games got them to a game over the Hornets for sixth place. Dirk Nowitzki also entered the postseason with a streak of twenty-five consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points, which was ended in the first game of the quarterfinals series versus the arch-rival, San Antonio Spurs.|$|E

25|$|Maxis {{went public}} in 1995 with revenue of US$38 million. The stock reached $50 a share and then dropped as Maxis posted a loss. EA bought Maxis in June 1997. Wright had been {{thinking}} about making a virtual doll house ever since the early 1990s, similar to SimCity but focused on individual people; after losing his home during the Oakland firestorm of 1991, he was inspired to turn his experiences of rebuilding his life into a game. Sims would be based on Wright's focus on building homes, which came from inspiration he found first-hand. Wright, was <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> to include many fires in the game, which were extra difficult for the player to extinguish. Themes like carpentry, home construction, and bare ground in need of landscaping, are common throughout the game. Originally conceived of as an architectural design game called Home Tactics, Wright's idea changed when someone suggested the player should be rated on the quality of life experience by the homeowners. It was a difficult idea to sell to EA, because already 40% of Maxis's employees had been laid off.|$|E

He was a Christian Scientist and Sean Ely believed his father suffered from skin cancer.|$|E
500|$|Reeve Robert Williams {{suggested}} {{ferns and}} flowers indigenous to British Columbia {{would be brought}} in, and planted around the statue. Williams insisted the flora would not obscure anatomy. Township Council voted to place the statue in a [...] "suitable place" [...] in the yet-to-be-opened municipal offices. The sculptor suggested {{that he was not}} <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> what a fig leaf looked like, an often suggested addition, and no coverage was requested during the commission.|$|E

500|$|... "Spit & Eggs" [...] {{features}} the reveal that Mercer Hayes, played by Ryan Devlin, is the Hearst serial rapist. Devlin was unaware {{that he would}} be the perpetrator until reading the episode's script; he stated, [...] "To tell you the truth, I'm not <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> the writers knew where my story was headed. But I was happy to do it – it's way more fun being bad than good!" [...] The episode also marks the final appearance by Ed Begley, Jr., after his character is killed. The mystery surrounding his murder would be the next major story arc.|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{polarized}} {{with the}} characters' reaction to Lori opting for an abortion. Halden criticized the character's opposing {{views on the}} matter, and stated that their reasonings were invalid. Halden wrote. [...] "I'm not <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> {{it would be possible}} for her to abort the pregnancy at this point, but the show's working on the assumption that having a child in a world where death literally lurks around every corner is an unequivocal good. The only person who’s been anti-pregnancy is Lori, and the show hasn't managed to cast her in a very good light, so it’s not like her arguments hold much water—which is also ridiculous, because ultimately, her opinion {{is the only one that}} matters." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall reflected similar thoughts, and stated that Rick's arguments against Lori's attempts were obsolete.|$|E
500|$|Famed author Clive Cussler and his NUMA {{organization}} also {{attempted to}} solve the mystery, searching for the aircraft in Maine and in Newfoundland. They made multiple visits in the 1980s, and interviewed dozens of elderly witnesses: hunters, fishermen and others who said they had seen or heard the aircraft pass by in 1927. The NUMA expedition was named [...] "Midnight Ghost", after Lindbergh's quote in his book The Spirit of St. Louis, where he said that Nungesser and Coli had [...] "vanished like midnight ghosts". In 1992, divers traveled to Newfoundland and attempted to locate and search Great Gull Pond for a wreck, but found nothing, and were not <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> that they had located the right lake. Other lakes were also searched, from Machias, Maine, to Chesterfield, Maine.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} of the Family Guy, Volume Four DVD collection, Mike Drucker of IGN singled out [...] "Peterotica" [...] and [...] "PTV" [...] as [...] "new classics." [...] In {{a review of}} the episode, Bob Sassone of TV Squad commented on the scene where Peter acts as a {{landlord}} over a rat, writing, [...] "to be honest, I'm not <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> what the hell was going on there, it was so disturbing." [...] Geoffrey D. Roberts of Real Talk Reviews criticized the episode, writing that [...] "the story is thin and the laughter absent." [...] The episode sparked controversy over a depiction of the Charwoman cleaning character, a character used by Carol Burnett [...] in The Carol Burnett Show that was used in the episode without her consent. Burnett sued, but the case was later dismissed.|$|E
500|$|Jennings' {{debut on}} September 5, 1983, marked the {{beginning}} of a steady climb in the ratings for ABC News. He spent his first year at the anchor desk educating himself on American domestic affairs in preparation for the 1984 presidential campaign season. In June 1984, Jennings, who later admitted that his political knowledge was limited at the time, co-anchored ABC's coverage of the Democratic National Convention with David Brinkley. [...] "I had not covered an election campaign in 16 years," [...] Jennings said, [...] "so here was I going to co-anchor with David Brinkley in 1984, and he wasn't <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> I knew who the faces belonged to, and he was right." [...] Jennings and ABC were criticized for suddenly halting coverage of the convention for 30 minutes and airing a rerun of Hart to Hart instead.|$|E
500|$|For writing Ibuki, Zubkavich was {{nominated}} for a Joe Shuster Award. He said that, compared to Sakura, [...] "Ibuki's a more complex character, more flawed. She's a great ninja but she isn't <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> this is what she wants out of life. (...) Sakura's never-give-up attitude may be more of a classic anime archetype, but I feel Ibuki's a character more people can empathize with." [...] He added, [...] "Ibuki’s personality has been limited to game endings and oh-so brief lines of dialogue from her victory quotes, so expanding upon those with this focused story is an honour and a challenge." [...] In a poll by Omar Dogan on his DeviantArt website, most of voters wanted to see Ibuki [...] "wearing something cute", and precisely something in the Harajuku-style Lolita fashion. Dogan's own favourite part of the story was [...] "the part where Ibuki and Oro battle." ...|$|E
6000|$|He was <b>even</b> <b>surer</b> {{about it}} the morning after, {{when he was trying}} to be grave and {{paternal}} with his daughters at breakfast. At noontime he was less sure. He did not deny that he had been a fool; he saw it almost as clearly as at midnight; but anything, he struggled, was better than going back to a life of barren heartiness. At four he wanted a drink. He kept a whisky flask in his desk now, and after two minutes of battle he had his drink. Three drinks later he began to see the Bunch as tender and amusing friends, and by six he was with them [...] . and the tale was to be told all over.|$|R
6000|$|It was, however, {{evident that}} Mrs. Wade was not coming that day, else Paula {{would not be}} running away thirty miles up the valley. That was it, {{and there was no}} {{blinking}} it.

And further, she was making the <b>evening</b> <b>sure.</b> She would not be back for dinner, or till long after dinner, it was a safe wager, unless she brought the whole Wickenberg crowd with her.

500|$|Azaria {{wrote and}} {{directed}} the 2004 short film Nobody's Perfect, which won the Film Discovery Jury Award for Best Short at the US Comedy Arts Festival. In January 2007, he was confirmed to be directing Outsourced, a film about two American workers who journey to get their jobs back, after their factory is moved to Mexico. In 2009, Azaria told Empire he was instead focusing on making a documentary about fatherhood. Two years later he told the Los Angeles Times that this project was [...] "half-complete" [...] and was [...] "forever looking for financing to finish it." [...] It eventually began in 2014, airing on AOL as an online series titled Fatherhood. According to AOL, the series of short episodes documents Azaria's [...] "touching, humorous, and often enlightening journey {{from a man who}} is not <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> he wants to have kids, to a father going through the joys, trials and tribulations of being a dad." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{significant}} obstacles for {{law enforcement}} were Bundy's generic, essentially anonymous physical features, and a curious chameleon-like ability to change his appearance almost at will. Early on, police complained of the futility of showing his photograph to witnesses; he looked different in virtually every photo ever taken of him. In person, [...] "his expression would so change his whole appearance that there were moments that you weren't <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> {{you were looking at}} the same person", said Stewart Hanson, Jr., the judge in the DaRonch trial. [...] "He [...] really a changeling." [...] Bundy was well aware of this unusual quality and he exploited it, using subtle modifications of facial hair or hairstyle to significantly alter his appearance as necessary. He concealed his one distinctive identifying mark, a dark mole on his neck, with turtleneck shirts and sweaters. Even his Volkswagen Beetle proved difficult to pin down; its color was variously described by witnesses as metallic or non-metallic, tan or bronze, light brown or dark brown.|$|E
500|$|... "Breakout" [...] {{was written}} by Ted Bruner, in {{collaboration}} with Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. It was first recorded by American pop singer Katy Perry, for her second album One of the Boys (2008), though it was never included for the album and was passed on to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals. Like most songs on Breakout, Cyrus wrote [...] "7 Things" [...] while traveling on the Best of Both Worlds Tour, reflecting on her numerous emotions about an ex-boyfriend. She claimed her {{use of the word}} [...] "hate" [...] demonstrated how furious she was, at the time. Originally, [...] "7 Things" [...] was more [...] "soft and nice" [...] but Cyrus says she [...] "went nuts" [...] during the recording process and gave the song a harder sound. She decided to record a cover version of Cyndi Lauper's [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] from the album She's So Unusual (1983), after speaking with Lauper at the 50th Grammy Awards. The two singers were conversing about music, when Lauper stated, [...] "Well, don't be scared of anything. People waste their lives being scared. Lasso the moon. But don't do it because someone tells you it's the right idea." [...] Cyrus believed Lauper's saying encompassed the direction she wanted to take Breakout, ergo she covered [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun". However, she desired for the cover to be completely different from other covers of [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] she heard. She described the process as [...] "almost [...] to relearn the song." [...] About the finished product, Cyrus said, [...] "When you listen to the song, it's, like, you're not <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> what it is. It's something completely new." [...] "Full Circle" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Scott Cutler, and Anne Preven about Cyrus' relationship with Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers. [...] "It's about two people. They're always gonna come back together no matter what anyone says, the bad people that try to keep you apart", Cyrus said of the song's concept.|$|E

However, the Munich marque still took victory when the CiBiEmme Sport's M3 finished first, {{in the hands of}} Enzo Calderari and Fabio Mancini.

2500|$|I think I {{agree with}} your [...] order for reading the books more than with your mother's. The series was not planned {{beforehand}} as she thinks.
