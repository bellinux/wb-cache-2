40|$|Using household-level data, {{we explore}} <b>the</b> {{relationship}} between <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{victims of the}} 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami disaster and other charitable donations. The empirical evidence suggests that donations specifically {{for the victims of}} the tsunami are positively associated with the amount previously donated to other charitable causes, which accords with complementary rather than substitution effects. This relationship exists when we decompose overall charitable donations into different types of philanthropy, with charitable contributions to caring, needy and religious organizations having the largest positive association with <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> victims of the tsunami. When we explore <b>the</b> impact of <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> victims of the tsunami on future <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> charity, however, our findings suggest an inverse relationship with the largest inverse association with <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> needy and caring organizations. ...|$|R

The government allocated $5.1million (Trinidad and Tobago dollars) for relief work, to be coordinated by the National Emergency Relief Organization of Trinidad and Tobago, which was established following the damaging Hurricane Flora in 1963. This helped rebuild damage houses, clear roads, and assist affected farmers. The United States Agency for International Development sent about $5,000 (USD) in assistance, after the country's ambassador sent a formal request to Washington, D.C.

5|$|The castle {{remained}} {{the property of}} the Clarendons until 1937, when Lord Clarendon found the maintenance of the castle too expensive and sold Kenilworth to the industrialist Sir John Siddeley. Siddeley, whose tax accounting in the 1930s had been at least questionable, was keen to improve his public image and gave over the running of the castle, complete with a charitable <b>donation,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Commissioner of Works. In 1958 his son gave the castle itself to the town of Kenilworth and English Heritage has managed the property since 1984.

There has not been any major investment in the ground since the 1990s, and it has faced problems with holes in the Main Stand roof, crumbling in the Grosvenor Road End, drainage problems and toilet conditions. Bootham Crescent holds a capacity of 8,256, with seating for 3,409.|$|E

5|$|Evidence for Edward's {{involvement}} in legal reform {{is hard to}} find but his reign saw a major programme of legal change. Much of the drive and determination is likely to have come from the king and his experience of the baronial reform movement of the late 1250s and early 1260s. With the Statutes of Mortmain, Edward imposed his authority over the Church; the statutes prohibited land <b>donation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Church, asserted the rights of the Crown at the expense of traditional feudal privileges, promoted the uniform administration of justice, raised income and codified the legal system. His military campaigns left him in heavy debt and when Philip IV of France confiscated the Duchy of Gascony in 1294, Edward needed funds to wage war in France. When Edward summoned a precedent-setting assembly in order to raise more taxes for military finance, he included lesser landowners and merchants. The resulting parliament included barons, clergy, knights, and burgesses for the first time.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, William G. Dyer became {{dean of the}} school. Dyer {{oversaw the}} {{construction}} of the N. Eldon Tanner Building, which was dedicated in 1982.

Two years later (1986), the International Student Sponsor Program was started, which continues to provide financial assistance to married LDS international students to this day. In 1988, the name of the school was changed to Marriott School of Management in honor of its benefactors—Marriott International founders J. Willard and Alice Marriott—following their $15million <b>donation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school. That same year, the Army and Air Force ROTC programs became a part of the Marriott School.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 2009, Tonight Show host Conan O'Brien engaged in a satirical on-air and YouTube feud with Booker, with O'Brien jokingly {{insulting}} the City of Newark and Booker responding that he would ban O'Brien from the Newark airport.

Booker then appeared on O'Brien's show and assured viewers that the feud was over and that he was actually a big fan of O'Brien, who agreed that every time he made a joke about Newark, he would donate $500 to the City of Newark, and also made a $50,000 <b>donation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Newark Now charity, which was matched by NBC Universal.|$|E

5|$|The DJ AM Memorial Fund, an {{organization}} {{designed to help}} people struggling with drug addiction, was launched in his memory. In November 2009, 800 pairs of Goldstein's sneakers were listed on eBay {{to raise funds for}} the organization. In August 2010, the fund made a <b>donation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles' Phoenix House Academy to help rehab patients develop musical talents. Goldstein's sister, who founded the fund, died from cancer in May 2011. In August 2011, several DJs paid tribute to Goldstein at the Vanity Nightclub in the Las Vegas Hard Rock Casino, helping raise money for the fund. In May 2012, the eighth annual MusiCares benefit concert featured a special presentation commemorating the launch of the DJ AM Memorial Fund. Goldstein's mother, in conjunction with the fund, was reported to be assisting MusiCares in providing recovery services to addicts. Moby deejayed at the event in tribute to Goldstein.|$|E
5|$|NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{addressed the}} issue of head injuries in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012 at the Harvard School of Public Health. In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce head injuries by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions on the sideline, and removing players from the game after they have been diagnosed or suspected of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on brain injuries and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players need to be more willing to acknowledge their injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million <b>donation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> National Institutes of Health to research the connection between brain injuries and long-term mental health issues. Beginning in 2012 the NFL was the subject of several lawsuits initiated by former players who alleged that the league withheld information and misled players about the potential long-term impacts of head injuries. Six of the lawsuits were approved to be tried together. In August 2013 the NFL reached a settlement with more than 4,500 former players, agreeing to pay $765 million to be used to pay for medical examinations for former NFL players and for research and education purposes. Additionally, the funds will also be used to compensate former players who are determined to have significant cognitive impairment.|$|E
5|$|On their <b>donation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> South Kensington Museum, {{the nine}} works donated by Watts were {{hung on the}} {{staircase}} leading to the library, but Hope proved a popular loan to other institutions {{as a symbol of}} current British art. At the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887 in Manchester, an entire wall was dedicated to the works of Watts. Hope, only recently completed but already the most famous of Watts's works, was placed at the centre of this display. It was then exhibited at the 1888 Melbourne Centennial Exhibition and the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris, before being moved to Munich for display at the Glaspalast. In 1897 {{it was one of the}} 17 Watts works transferred to the newly created National Gallery of British Art (commonly known as the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain); at the time, Watts was so highly regarded that an entire room of the new museum was dedicated to his works. The Tate Gallery considered Hope one of the highlights of their collection and did not continue the South Kensington Museum's practice of lending the piece to overseas exhibitions.|$|E
