5|$|Following {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} {{that had been}} required to provide <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> {{in response to the}} crises caused by the initial Japanese movements a review of the makeshift organisation was undertaken. In October 1942, the NGAWW Company was officially formed as part of New Guinea Force Signals to consolidate the Army, RAAF and Coastwatcher stations. Meanwhile, efforts were made to standardise equipment across the network and to implement common procedures. The company subsequently came under command of New Guinea Force Signals and its headquarters was established at 9-mile near Port Moresby. Captain Thomas Warren was in command of the company at this time. The establishment of the company at this time included a headquarters, a Moresby area section, a sub-area section, and a spotting station. Sub-area sections were raised as required and at various times were located at Milne Bay, Dobodura, Wau, Bena Bena, Bulolo, Nadzab, Gusap, Hollandia and Aitape. By the end of 1942 the company was maintaining 61 operational stations and had a strength of 180 men. In mid-1943, Warren was transferred to Milne Force and he handed over command temporarily to Captain Gordon King.|$|E

25|$|Access {{to water}} supply and {{sanitation}} in urban areas of Nicaragua has been declining, since there has been little expansion in access while population levels have increased. Even though the JMP found coverage levels to be at 85% in 2010, the Nicaraguan Water and Sewerage Enterprise (ENACAL), the public utility responsible for provision of water and sanitation services to urban areas, estimates that <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> is less than 60 percent due to insufficient and unreliable service. There have been significant improvements in rural areas, however, since 1990. Access to improved water supply in rural areas has increased significantly from 54% in 1990 to 68% in 2010.|$|E

The Yule–Nielsen {{modified}} spectral Neugebauer model (YNSN) enhanced for {{accounting for}} ink spreading {{in the different}} ink superposition conditions requires a spectrophotometer to measure the reflectances of halftone calibration patches in order to compute the ink spreading curves mapping nominal ink surface <b>coverage</b> to <b>effective</b> ink surface <b>coverage.</b> Instead, {{as a first step}} towards the “on the fly ” characterization of printers, we try to deduce the ink spreading curves from digitized RGB images of halftone calibration patches. By applying the Yule–Nielsen broadband formula to the average RGB intensities, we deduce the <b>effective</b> dot surface <b>coverages</b> of halftone calibration patches. We then establish the ink spreading curves mapping nominal dot surface <b>coverages</b> to <b>effective</b> dot surface <b>coverages.</b> By weighting the contributions of the different ink spreading curves according to the ratios of colorant surface coverages, we predict according to the YNSN model the reflectance spectra of the test patches. We compare the prediction accuracy of the YNSN model calibrated by digitized RGB intensities of the calibration patches with the prediction accuracy of the same model calibrated by the spectral reflectances of these calibration patches. The decrease in spectral prediction accuracy due to RGB model calibration is about 30 % for ink jet prints and 10 % fo...|$|R
