25|$|The P-X shares some {{components}} {{with the}} C-X, later {{designated as the}} Kawasaki C-2, another indigenously-developed aircraft to replace the Kawasaki C-1 and C-130H Hercules cargo aircraft. The P-X and C-X designs were originally independent, {{it was decided that}} having common components to both designs would be useful. The JDA mandated that the two aircraft share identical body components; common components include the cockpit windows, outer wings, horizontal stabilizer, and other systems. Internal shared parts include the auxiliary power unit, cockpit panel, flight control system computer, anti-collision lights, and <b>gear</b> <b>control</b> unit. Due to the different roles of the two aircraft, they remain distinctly separate. The sharing of development resources had allowed for a large reduction in overall development costs which, when including the C-2, were reported as being 345 billion Yen ($3 billion) in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Kawasaki {{developed}} the C-X {{in parallel with}} the P-X, which it had also been selected to develop. As a cost saving measure, major airframe parts and system components were shared between the two aircraft. They use the same basic wing structure, although it is installed at different sweep angle and dihedral on the two versions, with different high lift devices and powerplant attachments. Common components include the cockpit windows, outer wings, horizontal stabilizer, and other systems. Internal shared parts include the auxiliary power unit, cockpit panel, flight control system computer, anti-collision lights, and <b>gear</b> <b>control</b> unit. As of 2007, the total development cost for the two aircraft has been 345 billion yen (or roughly equal to $2.9 billion), which is low compared to similar programs; for example, the development contract for the Boeing P-8 Poseidon alone was $3.89 billion.|$|E

5000|$|Ajax, Ontario: {{design and}} {{development}} of fully integrated landing gear systems. It also focuses on ancillary systems such as steering control, landing <b>gear</b> <b>control</b> and indication, emergency control, brake control, wheels, brakes, tires, door mechanisms and electrical harnesses. This site is the final assembly area where landing gear systems for many aircraft are fully assembled and tested before shipping to the customer. It has test facilities for development and certification.|$|E
50|$|A bicycle shifter or <b>gear</b> <b>control</b> or gear levers is a {{component}} {{used to control}} the gearing mechanisms and select the desired gear ratio. Typically, they operate either a derailleur mechanism or an internal hub gear mechanism. In either case, the control is operated by moving a cable that connects the shifter to the gear mechanism. Shifters are mounted on the down tube of the frame, stem, or various locations on the handlebars.|$|E
5000|$|The {{game was}} {{noted for its}} realism and audio and video commentaries. Electronic Arts teamed up with {{automotive}} magazine Road & Track to match vehicle behavior, including the mimicking of the sounds made by the vehicles' <b>gear</b> <b>control</b> levers. The game also contained precise vehicle data with spoken commentary, several [...] "magazine style" [...] images of each car interior and exterior and even short video clips highlighting the vehicles set to music.|$|E
50|$|Corliss used {{automatic}} variable cut off. The valve <b>gear</b> <b>controlled</b> {{engine speed}} {{by using the}} governor to vary {{the timing of the}} cut off. This was partly responsible for the efficiency improvement in addition to the better speed control.|$|R

50|$|Machines that {{ply yarn}} use the 'regular' method {{mentioned}} above.

5000|$|The first {{installment}} of The Need for Speed {{was the only}} serious attempt by the series to provide a realistic simulation of car handling elements through the direct collaboration of Staff members from Road & Track. Electronic Arts left the handling dynamics tuning with the automotive magazine's seasoned drivers to match vehicle behavior including realistic over and understeer that remains impressive decades later, as well as sounds made by the vehicles' <b>gear</b> <b>control</b> levers and other functions. The game contained vehicle data with spoken commentary, several [...] "magazine style" [...] images of each car, and short video-clips highlighting the vehicles set to music.|$|E
5000|$|The {{footplate}} has openings cut in it {{for various}} purposes. The firebox always extends beneath the footplate. The cylinders are beneath the footplate, and steam pipes pass through holes to them. The reversing <b>gear</b> <b>control</b> for the valve gear also passes through, and in some locomotives part of the valve motion also extends through the footplate. [...] On British Railways Standard Locomotives the running plate was high enough to clear the wheels On earlier British locomotives, {{the tops of the}} wheels usually projected through slots in the running plate and were covered by [...] "splashers" [...] which are analogous to mudguards on a road vehicle.|$|E
50|$|One of {{his major}} {{contributions}} was shape coding in the aircraft cockpit. After a series of runway crashes of the Boeing B-17, Chapanis found that certain cockpit controls were confused with each other, due partly to their proximity and similarity of shape. Particularly, the controls for flaps and landing gear were confused, the consequences {{of which could be}} severe. Chapanis proposed attaching a wheel {{to the end of the}} landing <b>gear</b> <b>control</b> and a triangle to the end of the flaps control, to enable them to be easily distinguished by touch alone. Thereafter for that aircraft there were no further instances of the landing gear being mistakenly raised while the aircraft was still on the ground. This particular shape-coding of cockpit controls is still used today.|$|E
50|$|The MK1 came {{in either}} Metallic Blue or Metallic Red, {{although}} the earliest Grifters were mainly blue. It {{is now known}} that the later MK1 models were more of a bronzy red rather than the original candy apple red.

50|$|A geared head takes a pan and {{tilt head}} and adds gears {{to each of}} the axes. They {{typically}} have a release on each axis to allow for rough positioning the camera, and <b>geared</b> <b>controls</b> then allow small adjustments to finesse composition. They are typically heavier than ball or pan heads due to the weight of the mechanisms.|$|R

50|$|Below the HVAC button {{section is}} a panel that opens to give {{access to the}} DVD changer which also {{includes}} a CompactFlash card reader. On the center console, a metal control wheel for the COMAND system sits above a piece of wood, surrounded by metal buttons.

The control design is described and closed-loop test and analysis comparisons are presented...|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated and had Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> <b>controlled</b> by steam reversing gear. The cylinders {{and steam}} chests were formed in three separate castings. The high-pressure cylinders were arranged with piston valves, while the low-pressure cylinders were arranged with Richardson balanced type slide valves, arranged above the cylinders.

50|$|Manual {{transmissions}} {{are characterized}} by gear ratios that are selectable by locking selected gear pairs to the output shaft inside the transmission. Conversely, most automatic transmissions feature epicyclic (planetary) <b>gearing</b> <b>controlled</b> by brake bands and/or clutch packs to select gear ratio. Automatic transmissions that allow the driver to manually select the current gear are called manumatics.
