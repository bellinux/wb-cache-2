5000|$|Just as Pascal's {{triangle}} can be computed {{by using}} binomial coefficients, so can Leibniz's: [...] Furthermore, the <b>entries</b> of this <b>triangle</b> can be computed from Pascal's: [...] "The terms in each row are the initial term {{divided by the}} corresponding Pascal triangle entries."

5000|$|Singmaster's {{conjecture}} is a conjecture in combinatorial {{number theory}} in mathematics, {{named after the}} British mathematician David Singmaster who proposed it in 1971. It says {{that there is a}} finite upper bound on the multiplicities of <b>entries</b> in Pascal's <b>triangle</b> (other than the number 1, which appears infinitely many times). It is clear that the only number that appears infinitely many times in Pascal's triangle is 1, because any other number x can appear only within the first x + 1 rows of the triangle.|$|R
50|$|But this is {{also the}} formula for a cell of Pascal's triangle. Rather than {{performing}} the calculation, one can simply look up the appropriate <b>entry</b> in the <b>triangle.</b> Provided we have the first row and the first entry in a row numbered 0, the answer will be located at entry k in row n. For example, suppose a basketball team has 10 players and wants to know how many ways there are of selecting 8. The answer is entry 8 in row 10, which is 45; that is, 10 choose 8 is 45.|$|R

40|$|Our goal is {{to study}} Pascal-Sierpinski gaskets, which are certain fractal sets deﬁned in terms of divisibility of <b>entries</b> in Pascal’s <b>triangle.</b> The {{principal}} tool is a “carry rule” for {{the addition of the}} base-q representation of coordinates of points in the unit square. In the case that q = p is prime, we connect the carry rule to the power of p appearing in the prime factorization of binomialcoeﬃcients. We use the carry rule to deﬁne a family of fractal subsets Bqr of the unit square, and we show that when q = p is prime, Bqr coincides with the Pascal-Sierpinski gasket corresponding to N = pr. We go on to describe Bqr as the limit of an iterated function system of “partial similarities”, and we determine its Hausdorﬀ dimension. We consider also the corresponding fractal sets in higher-dimensional Euclidean space...|$|R

For example, the number of ways Fred could go from [...] to [...] or (0,1) is exactly one; to (1,1) is two; to (2,0) or (0,2) is one; to (1,2) or (2,1) is three; and so on. Actually, you could receive the number of ways {{to get to a}} particular point by adding up the number of ways you can get to the point south of it and the number of ways you can get to the point west of it.(With the starting point being zero and all the points directly north and south of it one.) In general, one soon discovers that the number of paths from A to any such X corresponds to an <b>entry</b> of Pascal's <b>Triangle.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{show the}} {{existence}} of a series of transforms that capture several structures that underlie higher-dimensional partitions. These transforms lead to a sequence of <b>triangles</b> whose <b>entries</b> are given combinatorial interpretations as the number of particular types of skew Ferrers diagrams. The end result of our analysis is {{the existence of}} a triangle, that we denote by F, which implies that the data needed to compute the number of partitions of a given positive integer is reduced by a factor of half. The number of spanning rooted forests appears intriguingly in a family of <b>entries</b> in the <b>triangle</b> F. Using modifications of an algorithm due to Bratley-McKay, we are able to directly enumerate entries in some of the triangles. As a result, {{we have been able to}} compute numbers of partitions of positive integers <= 25 in any dimension.

Then {{the product of}} the six binomial coefficients surrounding f I is a perfect integral square. In this paper, we show that this theorem is a special case of a more general result. In particular, we prove the following theorem. Theorem 2. Let H., for j odd, be a hexagon of <b>entries</b> from Pascal's <b>triangle</b> with j + 1 entries per side and with the sides lying along main diagonal and horizontal rows of the triangle.

40|$|We {{are used}} to imagining Pascal’s {{triangle}} as extending forever downwards from a vertex located at the top. But {{it is interesting to}} see it as occupying the first quadrant of the plane with it’s vertex at (0, 0). Imagine further that the plane is made of graph paper — that is, that we have embedded into it the Cayley graph of Z × Z with respect to the standard generating set. If we place the <b>entries</b> of Pascal’s <b>triangle</b> at the vertices of this Cayley graph, they now measure something about this graph. The entry at each point gives the number of geodesics from (0, 0) to that point. This leads us to the following definition. Definition. Suppose Γ = ΓG(G) is the Cayley graph of G with respect to the generating set G. The Pascal’s function, p = pG: G → Z is given by p(g) = #{geodesics from 1 to g in ΓG(G) }. This definition can be extended to any graph. We will only be interested in Cayley graphs. Conversations with several emminent geometric group theorists and combinatorists suggest that surpisingly little is known about these. I wish t...|$|R
40|$|The Wiener matrix and the hyper-Wiener {{number of}} a tree (acyclic structure) were first {{introduced}} by Randic [1]. Randic and Guo and colleagues [2, 3] further introduced the higher Wiener numbers {{of a tree}} that can be represented by a Wiener number sequence W- 1, W- 2, W- 3, [...] ., where W- 1 = W is the Wiener index, and Sigma(k= 1, 2,) [...] . W-k = R is the hyper-Wiener number. Later the definition of hyper-Wiener number was extended by Klein et al. for application to any connected structure. In this study, the definition of higher Wiener numbers is extended to be applicable to any connected structure. The concepts of the Wiener vector and hyper-Wiener vector of a graph are introduced. Moreover, a matrix sequence W-(1), W-(2), W-(3), [...] ., called the Wiener matrix sequence (or distance matrix sequence), and their sum Sigma(k= 1, 2,) [...] . W-(k) = W-(H), called the hyper-Wiener matrix, are introduced, where W-(1) = D is the distance matrix, and {{the sum of the}} <b>entries</b> of upper <b>triangle</b> of W-(k) (resp.
