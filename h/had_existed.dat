5|$|A manor <b>had</b> <b>existed</b> at Ashby-de-la-Zouch from {{at least}} 1086, when the {{location}} was known as Ascebi. The lands were acquired by Robert de Beaumont, the Count of Meulan and later Earl of Leicester, in 1100. He established the Belmeis family there as his tenants and, after the Belmeis family line died out in 1160, the earls of Leicester reassigned the estate to the le Zouch family, from whom the manor took its later name.|$|E

5|$|Aside from dancewear and conventions, {{developments}} in agency representation occurred as well. Although limited, representation for individual dancers <b>had</b> <b>existed</b> since the 1980s {{at the beginning}} of the music video era due to the pioneering work of talent agent Julie McDonald. However, the UK-based dance agencies ProDance and Superbad Talent were created to exclusively represent street dancers.|$|E

Between 1924 and 1930, he excavated two lodges and over fifty graves.|$|E
5|$|La Reforma is a Plio-Pleistocene caldera on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.

Some of these, {{such as those}} from Episodes 1–2 of The Daleks' Master Plan, survive to this day.

5|$|The medieval {{world was}} a much less urban society than either the Roman Empire or the modern world. The fall of the Roman Empire had caused a catastrophic de-population of the towns and cities that <b>had</b> <b>existed</b> within the Empire.

5|$|A {{tower was}} {{built out of}} {{the remains of the}} roof, similar to one that <b>had</b> <b>existed</b> at Claremont Road, and a system of defences and {{blockades}} were built. A core of around 30 protesters ensured that there were always people staying there (a legal requirement for a squatted home, as well as a defence against eviction). They were finally evicted on 21 June 1995, whereupon, as at Claremont Road, the building was immediately demolished. The total cost of removing the protesters from Munstonia was given to be £239,349.52, not including additional costs of security guards.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2008 book The Bomb in the Basement, several {{deaths in}} Israel during 1957–1969 {{were caused by}} 210Po. A leak was {{discovered}} at a Weizmann Institute laboratory in 1957. Traces of 210Po {{were found on the}} hands of Professor Dror Sadeh, a physicist who researched radioactive materials. Medical tests indicated no harm, but the tests did not include bone marrow. Sadeh died from cancer. One of his students died of leukemia, and two colleagues died after a few years, both from cancer. The issue was investigated secretly, and there was never any formal admission that a connection between the leak and the deaths <b>had</b> <b>existed.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{regarded as}} foreign elements in Roman culture, {{music and dance}} <b>had</b> <b>existed</b> in Rome from earliest times. Music was customary at funerals, and the tibia (Greek aulos), a woodwind instrument, was played at sacrifices to ward off ill influences. Song (carmen) {{was an integral part}} of almost every social occasion. The Secular Ode of Horace, commissioned by Augustus, was performed publicly in 17 BC by a mixed children's choir. Music was thought to reflect the orderliness of the cosmos, and was associated particularly with mathematics and knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the seventh {{generation}} {{was the beginning of}} direct competition between dedicated handheld gaming devices, and increasingly powerful PDA/cell phone devices such as the iPhone and iPod Touch, and the latter being aggressively marketed for gaming purposes.

5|$|Blues is a {{combination}} of African work songs, field hollers, and shouts. It developed in the rural South {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century. The most important characteristics of the blues is its use of the blue scale, with a flatted or indeterminate third, as well as the typically lamenting lyrics; though both of these elements <b>had</b> <b>existed</b> in African American folk music prior to the 20th century, the codified form of modern blues (such as with the AAB structure) did not exist until the early 20th century.|$|E
