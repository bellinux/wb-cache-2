50|$|MARS is an extracorporeal {{hemodialysis}} system {{composed of}} three different circuits: blood, albumin and low-flux dialysis. The blood circuit uses a <b>double</b> <b>lumen</b> <b>catheter</b> and a conventional hemodialysis device to pump the patient’s blood into the MARS FLUX, a biocompatible polysulfone high-flux dialyser. With a membrane surface area of 2.1 m2, 100 nm of thickness and a cut-off of 50 KDa, the MARSFLUX is essential to retaining the albumin in the dialysate. Blood is dialysed against a human serum albumin (HSA) dialysate solution that allows blood detoxification of both water-soluble and protein-bound toxins, {{by means of the}} presence of albumin in the dialysate (albumin dialysis). The albumin dialysate is then regenerated in a close loop in the MARS circuit by passing through the fibres of the low-flux diaFLUX filter, to clear water-soluble toxins and provide electrolyte/acid-base balance, by a standard dialysis fluid. Next, the albumin dialysate passes through two different adsorption columns; protein-bound substances are removed by the diaMARS AC250, containing activated charcoal and anionic substances are removed by the diaMARS IE250, filled with cholestyramine, an anion-exchange resin. The albumin solution is then ready to initiate another detoxifying cycle of the patient's blood that can be sustained until both adsorption columns are saturated, eliminating the need to continuously infuse albumin into the system during treatment (Fig. 1).|$|E

30|$|Good quality {{contrast}} enhancement {{is essential for}} visualising mediastinal structures in children {{due to lack of}} body fat. Contrast enhancement allows better assessment of nodes, vascular structures and branching pattern for differentiating between vessels and nodules. A low osmolar, non-iodinated contrast agent between 280 and 320  mg/l concentration is preferred. Wherever possible, this should be delivered via a dual-headed pressure injector (flow rate of 1.5 – 2  ml/s, maximum pressure of 100  PSI) into a (minimum) 22 -gauge venflon sited in the upper arm. The contrast volume used is determined empirically according to the patient’s weight, 1.5 – 2  ml/kg. This is followed by a 10  ml bolus of saline solution to minimise perivenous artefacts often seen in the superior vena cava in thorax CT examination. It is also possible to administer contrast using a pressure injector through a central venous <b>catheter</b> (6  Fr <b>double</b> <b>lumen</b> Hickman <b>catheter)</b> with a 1.5  ml/s flow rate.

40|$|In the {{functional}} evaluation {{of patients with}} heart disease, detailed information is sometimes required, and the patient is subjected to a heart catheterization which allows the measurement of flow, intravascular pressure, and other variables. It is generally agreed that these measurements should be made {{not only with the}} patient at rest but also during exercise. In addition, it is some-times desirable to analyse whether pulmonary hypertension is caused by anatomical changes in the pulmonary vessels or by an increased vascular tone (so-called active pulmonary hypertension). To this end vasodilator drugs, notably acetylcholine, have been used. Several workers (for example, Soderholm and Werk 6, 1959) have demonstrated that the infusion of acetylcholine to patients with mitral valvular disease often causes a fall in pulmonary arterial pressure and a decrease in the pulmonary vascular resistance.

An external fluid pump was attached to the catheter and the whole system was tested in vitro in human skin, in a cadaver model and in an in vivo rabbit model. Experiments were performed by delivering solutions of methylene blue in a controlled manner to the subcutaneous area to analyze the skin response to the process.

40|$|Enzyme based {{biosensor}} {{systems for}} ex vivo blood lactate monitoring were developed. The first approach utilised an immobilised enzyme reactor incorporated in a flow {{system and the}} main objectives were integration of sampling, sample handling, analysis, control and calibration. The flow system comprised a <b>double</b> <b>lumen</b> <b>catheter</b> for continuous sampling and heparinisation of blood, a dialysis unit for separation of macromolecules from the sample and an enzyme reactor containing lactate oxidase co-immobilised with catalase onto controlled pore glass for conversion of lactate. Detection was based on registration of the oxygen depletion taking place during substrate conversion and a differential measurement mode was employed to eliminate disturbances due to fluctuations in background oxygen levels. Control and calibration of the integrated system was possible {{by means of a}} microprocessor or computer. Operational stability was investigated using in vitro blood samples and during ex vivo monitoring in humans during physical exercise as well as in patients during open-heart surgery. Improved control and evaluation of sensor drift during long-term monitoring was realised through the development of a novel calibration method, based on the internal standard principle. The flow system could be calibrated in 5. 5 min without interruption of the sampling step by addition of an internal standard {{at the tip of the}} <b>double</b> <b>lumen</b> <b>catheter.</b> Accordingly, not only the analytical step but the system in its entirety was calibrated. The second approach was based on enzyme electrodes. Lactate oxidase was immobilised between polymeric membranes and combined with an electrode system based on classical amperometric detection of hydrogen peroxide. The aim was to develop a sensor system for direct measurement in whole blood, thus eliminating the need for sample pre-treatment. Blood contacting membranes with unique haemocompatibility properties were produced through modification of poly(vinyl chloride), PVC, membranes with non-ionic surfactant. Sensor linear range could be adjusted by varying the amount of added surfactant and thereby affecting the permeability of the external PVC membranes. A range of different polymeric materials were evaluated for use as permselective internal membranes. Selectivity against common interfering compounds such as ascorbate, urate and acetaminophen as well as adequate permeability to hydrogen peroxide were the main criteria. Functional haemocompatibility was demonstrated for enzyme electrodes evaluated in whole blood and such electrodes were later incorporated in a flow system for blood lactate measurement under continuous flow conditions. Without the need for a dialysis step, the lag time for transport of sample could be decreased from 5 min to 1 - 2 min thereby approaching real-time monitoring...|$|E

A novel <b>double</b> <b>lumen</b> cryoballoon <b>catheter</b> was designed for circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) with the cryoablation technique. MethodsWe consecutively enrolled 346 patients with symptomatic, drug refractory paroxysmal (n = 293) or persistent (n = 53) atrial fibrillation (AF). In all patients, PVI of all targeted PVs was the therapeutic aim. The primary end points of this nonrandomized study were: 1) acute isolation rate of targeted PV; and 2) first electrocardiogram-documented recurrence of AF. The secondary end point was occurrence of PV stenosis or atrio-esophageal fistula. ResultsThe 1, 360 of 1, 403 PVs (97 %) were targeted with balloons or balloons in combination with the use of Freezor Max (Cryocath). We found that ablation with the cryoballoon resulted in maintenance of sinus rhythm in 74 % of patients with PAF and 42 % of patients with persistent AF. No PV narrowing occurred. The most frequent complication was right phrenic nerve palsy observed during cryoballoon ablation at the right superior PV. ConclusionsPulmonary vein isolation with a new cryoballoon technique is feasible. Sinus rhythm can be maintained in the majority of patients with PAF by circumferential PVI using a cryoballoon ablation system. Cryoablation was less effective in patients with persistent AF than in patients with PAF...|$|R
40|$|Hemodialysis (HD) {{catheters}} {{are commonly}} used as temporary vascular access in patients with kidney failure who require immediate HD. The use of these catheters is limited by complications such as infections, thrombosis resulting in poor blood flow. We studied the complications and outcomes of nontunneled catheters used for vascular access in our dialysis unit. The records of all patients, with renal failure who were dialyzed {{over a two-year period}} and had a <b>double</b> <b>lumen</b> nontunneled <b>catheter</b> inserted, were retrieved. Catheter insertion was carried out under ultrasound guidance using the modified Seldinger technique. The demographic data of patients, etiology of chronic kidney disease, and complications and outcomes of these catheters were noted. Fifty-four patients with mean age 43. 7 ± 15. 8 years had 69 catheters inserted for a cumulative total of 4047 catheter-days. The mean catheter patency was 36. 4 ± 37. 2 days (range: 1 - 173 days). Thrombosis occluding the catheters was the most common complication and occurred in 58 % of catheters leading to catheter malfunction, followed by infections in 18. 8 % of catheters. During follow-up, 30 (43. 5 %) catheters were removed, 14 (20. 3 %) due to catheter malfunction, eight (11. 6 %) due to infection, five (7. 2 %) elective removal, and three (4. 3 %) due to damage. Thrombotic occlusion of catheters was a major limiting factor to the survival of HD catheters. Improvement in catheter patency can be achieved with more potent lock solutions...|$|R
40|$|In {{studies of}} gas {{exchange}} between the lung and the pulmonary circulation it is gen-erally {{assumed that the}} principal exchange {{takes place at the}} level of the pulmonary cap-illaries. The work presented here shows that some gaseous exchange can occur as well be-tween the lung and vessels of macroscopic size. Hydrogen gas when administered to a subject by inhalation can be detected in the pulmonary artery wedge position within two seconds after the inhalation of hydrogen. Methods The technique used in this study was originally described by Clark 1 and subsequently used by others. 2 " 7 The method consists of inserting a bare platinum electrode into the vascular system on the end of a standard catheter. The appearance of hydrogen gas at the electrode is signaled by the development of a potential between the plati-num electrode and a silver electrode placed on the subject's skin. The response time is practically instantaneous as illustrated in figure 1. Catheters were wedged in the pulmonary artery of 34 patients. Successful wedging of the cathe-ter was determined by the inability to advance the catheter further, by a pressure level and contour that was consistent with the wedge, and by a good "spring " on withdrawing the catheter. In all patients a <b>double</b> <b>lumen</b> Cournand <b>catheter</b> size 9 F was used, being introduced in small chil-dren through the saphenous vein and in larger children and adults through a medial antecubita...|$|R
