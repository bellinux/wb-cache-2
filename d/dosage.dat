5|$|Withdrawal and rebound {{symptoms}} commonly {{occur and}} necessitate a gradual reduction in <b>dosage</b> to minimize withdrawal effects when discontinuing.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in late 2009 by the National Addiction Centre (UK) found 41.3% of readers of Mixmag had used mephedrone {{in the last}} month, making it the fourth-most popular drug amongst clubbers. Of those, two thirds snorted the drug and the average <b>dosage</b> per session was 0.9g; the length of sessions increased as the <b>dosage</b> increased. Users who snorted the drug reported using more per session than those who took it orally (0.97g compared to 0.74g) and also reported using it more often (five days per month compared to three days per month). An Irish study of people on a methadone treatment program for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for mephedrone usage.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{interacts with}} many {{commonly}} used drugs, and the metabolism of warfarin varies greatly between patients. Some foods {{have also been}} reported to interact with warfarin. Apart from the metabolic interactions, highly protein bound drugs can displace warfarin from serum albumin and cause {{an increase in the}} INR. This makes finding the correct <b>dosage</b> difficult, and accentuates the need of monitoring; when initiating a medication that is known to interact with warfarin (e.g. simvastatin), INR checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal <b>dosage</b> is found.|$|E
5000|$|DRIs are {{established}} for elements, vitamins, and macronutrients. Common elemental and vitamin <b>dosages</b> are milligrams per day (mg/d) or micrograms per day (μg/d). Common macronutrient <b>dosages</b> are in grams per day (g/d). <b>Dosages</b> {{for all three}} {{are established}} by both gender and age.|$|R
25|$|As <b>dosages</b> {{increase}}, risks {{increase as}} well. Therefore, patients with relative contraindications may start at low <b>dosages</b> and increase gradually.|$|R
5000|$|Genes FGF8 and EN1 play an {{important}} role in patterning the midbrain and hindbrain regions. In particular, studies have shown that different <b>dosages</b> of FGF8 appear to specify the tectum or cerebellum: regions exposed to strong <b>dosages</b> of FGF8 acquire cerebellar characteristics while regions exposed to weak <b>dosages</b> become the tectum.|$|R
5|$|Alprazolam {{and other}} benzodiazepines may also cause the {{development}} of physical dependence, tolerance, and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during rapid dose reduction or cessation of therapy after long-term treatment. There is a higher chance of withdrawal reactions if the drug is administered in a higher <b>dosage</b> than recommended, or if a person stops taking the medication altogether without slowly allowing the body to adjust to a lower-dosage regimen.|$|E
5|$|Another test {{known as}} a phototest is the most useful in {{identifying}} solar urticaria. In this test, one centimeter segments of skin are subject to varying amounts of UVA and UVB radiation {{in order to determine}} the specific <b>dosage</b> of the certain form of radiation that causes the urticaria to form. When testing for its less intense form (fixed solar urticaria), phototesting should be conducted only in the areas where the hives have appeared to avoid the possibility of getting false-negative results.|$|E
5|$|In {{adults and}} {{children}} {{over the age of}} 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No <b>dosage</b> adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring hemodialysis, care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no <b>dosage</b> adjustments are needed in people undergoing continuous hemofiltration, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be given more frequently than normal in people with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.|$|E
30|$|The {{kerosene}} <b>dosages</b> {{was maintained}} at 1000  g/t, while different octanol <b>dosages</b> were tested. The frother experiment results {{are shown in}} Table  10.|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} the Environmental Engineering laboratory, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia on samples provided by Redland Shire Council Waterworks. The result showed that ozonation has positive effect towards alum <b>dosages</b> as a coagulant. Ozone <b>dosages</b> were 2. 86 ppm, 6. 25 ppm, and 11. 22 ppm, while alum <b>dosages</b> were 5 ppm, 10 ppm, and 15 ppm. Ca(OH) 2 was utilized as pH regulator with the <b>dosages</b> {{in the range of}} 4 ppm – 12 ppm. Effects of ozonation on coagulant <b>dosages</b> were measured by color level expressed in Pt-Co units. Maximum color removal was 87 % and 89 % determined spectrophotometrically with the wavelength of 360 nm and 400 nm respectively...|$|R
50|$|Suppose {{engineers}} at a semiconductor manufacturing facility want {{to test whether}} different wafer implant material <b>dosages</b> {{have a significant effect}} on resistivity measurements after a diffusion process taking place in a furnace. They have four different <b>dosages</b> they want to try and enough experimental wafers from the same lot to run three wafers at each of the <b>dosages.</b>|$|R
5|$|Lithium {{naturally}} only {{occurs in}} traces in biological systems {{and has no}} known biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested. Lithium carbonate {{is used as a}} mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2grams, although there are side-effects. Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness, slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, which is dangerous as the required <b>dosage</b> of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic <b>dosage.</b> Its biochemistry, the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.|$|E
5|$|McDonald {{was later}} {{appointed}} by Washington {{to serve as}} a lieutenant colonel in command of Virginia revolutionary militia forces during the American Revolutionary War. He also served on various revolutionary committees throughout the war. McDonald died on August 19, 1778, at his home Glengarry near Winchester after receiving an incorrect <b>dosage</b> of the medication potassium antimonyl tartrate.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} {{are often}} characterized as either qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative metabolites {{are defined as}} toxins that interfere with an herbivore’s metabolism, often by blocking specific biochemical reactions. Qualitative chemicals are present in plants in relatively low concentrations (often less than 2% dry weight), and are not <b>dosage</b> dependent. They are usually small, water-soluble molecules, and therefore can be rapidly synthesized, transported and stored with relatively little energy cost to the plant. Qualitative allelochemicals are usually effective against non-adapted specialists and generalist herbivores.|$|E
25|$|Various <b>dosages</b> of IL-2 {{across the}} United States {{and across the}} world are used. The {{efficiency}} and side effects of different <b>dosages</b> is often a point of disagreement.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} concentration of copper and lead on feeding and growth response of Limicolaria flammea were studied. Low dose (1 mg) of copper {{does not affect}} feeding activity in Limicolaria flammea whereas concentrations of 5 mg and 6 mg evoked a slow feeding rate. At low metal <b>dosages</b> there was no clear relationship between the deaths recorded in correlation with metal <b>dosages,</b> but at high Lead <b>dosages</b> {{there was a significant}} correlation between metal <b>dosages,</b> length of exposure and number of mortalities recorded (0. 965; p < 0. 01) ...|$|R
25|$|NET is weakly estrogenic (via {{conversion}} {{into its}} metabolite EE), {{and for this}} reason, {{it has been found}} at high <b>dosages</b> to be associated with high rates of estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men, but also with improvement of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. It has been suggested that very high <b>dosages</b> (e.g., 40mg/day, which are sometimes used in clinical practice for various indications) of NETA (and by extension NET) may result in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) analogously to high <b>dosages</b> (above 50μg/day) of EE, and that even <b>dosages</b> of NETA of 10 to 20mg, which correspond to EE <b>dosages</b> of approximately 20 to 30μg/day, may in certain women be associated with increased risk.|$|R
5|$|The {{effects of}} the drug begin 10–40minutes after ingestion, and last 2–6hours {{depending}} on dose, species, and individual metabolism. The half life of psilocybin is 163±64minutes when taken orally, or 74.1±19.6minutes when injected intravenously. A <b>dosage</b> of 4–10mg, corresponding roughly to 50–300micrograms per kilogram (µg/kg) of body weight, is required to induce psychedelic effects. A typical recreational <b>dosage</b> is 10–50mg psilocybin, which is roughly equivalent to 10–50grams of fresh mushrooms, or 1–5grams of dried mushrooms. A {{small number of people}} are unusually sensitive to psilocybin, such that a normally threshold-level dose of about 2mg can result in effects usually associated with medium or high doses. In contrast, there are some who require relatively high doses to experience noticeable effects. Individual brain chemistry and metabolism play a large role in determining a person's response to psilocybin.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} side effect {{is an increase}} in risk for epileptic seizures, which caused the drug to be withdrawn from the market for some time and then caused the recommended <b>dosage</b> to be reduced. In comparison to many other antidepressants, it does not cause as much weight gain, sexual dysfunction, or sleepiness. Bupropion acts as an norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is an atypical antidepressant, different from most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|The {{post-mortem}} examination concluded that Hendrix aspirated his own vomit {{and died of}} asphyxia while intoxicated with barbiturates. At the inquest, the coroner, finding no evidence of suicide and lacking sufficient evidence of the circumstances, recorded an open verdict. Dannemann stated that Hendrix had taken nine of her prescribed Vesparax sleeping tablets, 18 times the recommended <b>dosage.</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{passing of}} {{legislation}} in the United States and the European Union {{has led to the}} approval of <b>dosages</b> for pediatric use. This study was conducted in an attempt to find potentially important factors with regard to dose selection for the pediatric population. Methods: The FDA’s New Pediatric Labeling Information Database was used for this study. Drug labels for patients aged 6 months as well as those for patients aged 2, 6, and 11 years were standardized based on <b>dosages</b> expressed by age, normalized body weight (BW), and body surface area (BSA) in order to obtain ratios of pediatric-to-adult <b>dosages.</b> Labeling for 108 drugs were extracted for the analysis. Results: Ratios of pediatric-to-adult <b>dosages</b> based on BWwere higher than 1, but those based on BSA were around 1. Relative <b>dosages</b> at 6 months of age showed a stronger correlation with those at 2 years compared to those at other ages. Conclusion: The approved <b>dosages</b> for pediatrics based on BW were higher than those of adults, but the ones based on BSA were almost the same as those of adults. The closer the age groups, the stronger the correlation of relative <b>dosages</b> between the groups...|$|R
50|$|Low <b>dosages</b> (0.5-1 mg) are {{reported}} to produce a relaxing body high and mild entheogenic effects. Shulgin reports in TiHKAL that higher <b>dosages</b> (1-3 mg) can produce very unpleasant reactions.|$|R
2500|$|In {{clinical}} studies of prasterone supplementation, <b>dosages</b> {{have ranged from}} 20 to 1,600mg per day. In people with adrenal insufficiency, oral <b>dosages</b> of 20 to 50mg/day prasterone {{have been found to}} restore DHEA and DHEA-S levels to normal ranges seen in healthy young adults. Conversely, oral <b>dosages</b> of 100 to 200mg/day prasterone have been found to result in [...] levels of DHEA and DHEA-S.|$|R
5|$|With {{erythromycin}} {{therapy in}} DPB, great reduction in bronchiolar inflammation and damage is achieved through suppression {{of not only}} neutrophil proliferation, but also lymphocyte activity and obstructive mucus and water secretions in airways. The antibiotic effects of macrolides {{are not involved in}} their beneficial effects toward reducing inflammation in DPB. This is evident because the treatment <b>dosage</b> is much too low to fight infection, and in DPB cases with the occurrence of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa, erythromycin therapy still reduces inflammation.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} a group with a mean <b>dosage</b> of aspirin of 270mg per day {{estimated}} an average absolute risk increase in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) of 12 events per 10,000 persons. In comparison, the estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction was 137 events per 10,000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10,000 persons in ischemic stroke. In cases where ICH already has occurred, aspirin use results in higher mortality, with a dose of about 250mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within {{three months after the}} ICH around 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6).|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{was invented}} by Nariman Mehta of Burroughs Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) in 1969, and the US patent for it was granted in 1974. It was {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antidepressant on 30 December 1985, and marketed under the name Wellbutrin. However, a significant incidence of epileptic seizures at the originally recommended <b>dosage</b> caused the withdrawal of the drug in 1986. Subsequently, the risk of seizures was found to be highly dose-dependent, and bupropion was re-introduced to the market in 1989 with a lower maximum recommended daily dose.|$|E
50|$|NET is weakly estrogenic (via {{conversion}} {{into its}} metabolite EE), {{and for this}} reason, {{it has been found}} at high <b>dosages</b> to be associated with high rates of estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men, but also with improvement of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women.

30|$|The {{study showed}} that every {{treatment}} produced higher yields than control, while underlining that the usage of growing compost <b>dosages</b> caused the increase of production variables, which were measured after harvesting. Furthermore, {{it is observed that}} application of urea and 60 -years 80  Mg ha− 1 compost <b>dosages</b> produced the highest fresh weights and total weights, detecting that the largest root lengths are evidenced with chemical fertilization and the highest compost <b>dosages.</b>|$|R
30|$|In the end, {{the highest}} N, P and K {{contents}} in lettuce leafs {{were observed in}} the urea treatments and in the highest compost <b>dosages,</b> meanwhile the highest compost <b>dosages</b> could replace chemical fertilization with satisfactory results.|$|R
5|$|Cannabis {{can be a}} {{contributory}} {{factor in}} schizophrenia, potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk. The increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual or {{may be related to}} preexisting psychopathology. Early exposure is strongly associated with an increased risk. The size of the increased risk is not clear, but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis. Higher <b>dosage</b> and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased risk of chronic psychoses.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{had been}} raised that the {{radiation}} belt produced in orbit by the recent Operation Dominic nuclear tests would be dangerous to manned space missions, but an extensive study announced in early September declared that {{it was safe to}} fly. While the outside of the capsule was expected to receive a <b>dosage</b> of around 500 röntgens, the study concluded that shielding and the effect of the spacecraft structure would reduce this to around 8 röntgens experienced by the astronaut, well within established tolerance limits.|$|E
5|$|Quantitative {{chemicals}} {{are those that}} are present in high concentration in plants (5 – 40% dry weight) and are equally effective against all specialists and generalist herbivores. Most quantitative metabolites are digestibility reducers that make plant cell walls indigestible to animals. The effects of quantitative metabolites are <b>dosage</b> dependent and the higher these chemicals’ proportion in the herbivore’s diet, the less nutrition the herbivore can gain from ingesting plant tissues. Because they are typically large molecules, these defenses are energetically expensive to produce and maintain, and often take longer to synthesize and transport.|$|E
30|$|The main {{limitation}} was the non-double-blind {{design of}} the trial protocol. Another pharmacologic limit was the absence of plasmatic <b>dosages</b> of colistin. These <b>dosages</b> could preferentially assert our clinical and biological results of the low systemic diffusion of the inhaled route.|$|R
50|$|Cyclophosphamide {{is one of}} {{the most}} potent {{immunosuppressive}} substances. In small <b>dosages,</b> it is very efficient in the therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and other autoimmune diseases. High <b>dosages</b> cause pancytopenia and hemorrhagic cystitis.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, and in {{alternative}} medicine, the term [...] "redox therapy" [...] {{has also been}} {{used to describe the}} practice of administering high <b>dosages</b> of vitamins; in a 1984 study, high <b>dosages</b> of Menadione and Vitamin C were given to a patient.|$|R
