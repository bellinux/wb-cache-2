5|$|The {{original}} USB1.0 specification, {{which was}} introduced in January 1996, defined data transfer rates of 1.5Mbit/s Low Speed and 12Mbit/s Full Speed. Microsoft Windows 95, OSR 2.1 provided OEM support for the devices. The first widely used version of USB was 1.1, which was released in September 1998. The 12Mbit/s data rate was intended for higher-speed <b>devices</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> disk drives, and the lower 1.5Mbit/s rate for low data rate <b>devices</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> joysticks. Apple Inc.'s iMac was the first mainstream product with USB and the iMac's success popularized USB itself. Following Apple's design decision to remove all legacy ports from the iMac, many PC manufacturers began building legacy-free PCs, {{which led to the}} broader PC market using USB as a standard.|$|E
5|$|The type-A plug has an {{elongated}} rectangular cross-section, inserts into a type-A receptacle on a downstream port on a USB host or hub, and carries both power and data. Captive cables on USB <b>devices,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> keyboards or mice, will be terminated with a type-A plug.|$|E
5|$|A {{working group}} {{produced}} a 34-page report with recommendations following the official inquiry, which {{was approved by}} the Jockey Club. Considerable public discussion had arisen over the possibility of introducing electronic <b>devices,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> horns or flashing lights, to provide a fail-safe starting and recall system. The use of modern technology however was dismissed {{on the basis of a}} lack of total success overseas, and being open to sabotage and technical failure.|$|E

5|$|Chagas {{disease has}} a serious {{economic}} impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, {{is estimated to be}} $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical <b>devices</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion.|$|E
5|$|Cultural {{attitudes towards}} rain differ across the world. In {{temperate}} climates, {{people tend to}} be more stressed when the weather is unstable or cloudy, with its impact greater on men than women. Rain can also bring joy, as some consider it to be soothing or enjoy the aesthetic appeal of it. In dry places, such as India, or during periods of drought, rain lifts people's moods. In Botswana, the Setswana word for rain, pula, is used as the name of the national currency, in recognition of the economic importance of rain in its country, since it has a desert climate. Several cultures have developed means of dealing with rain and have developed numerous protection <b>devices</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> umbrellas and raincoats, and diversion <b>devices</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> gutters and storm drains that lead rains to sewers. Many people find the scent during and immediately after rain pleasant or distinctive. The source of this scent is petrichor, an oil produced by plants, then absorbed by rocks and soil, and later released into the air during rainfall.|$|E

5|$|Efforts {{are being}} made to monitor the water quality of the Fonteyn Kill, led by Vassar College's Environmental Research Institute and the Cornell University Cooperative Extension Dutchess County Environment Program. Three sites are {{regularly}} sampled for water quality while <b>devices</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> sondes continuously record temperature, conductivity, and pH. Benthic macroinvertebrates are frequently counted and fecal coliform counts are also run.|$|E
5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state <b>devices</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the transistor.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} the 6 Plus, Engadget panned its design for being uncomfortable to hold and harder to grip in {{comparison}} to other <b>devices</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Galaxy Note 3 and LG G3, but praised its inclusion of optical image stabilization and slightly better battery life than the 6.|$|E
50|$|Pixels {{per inch}} (PPI) or pixels per {{centimeter}} (PPCM) are {{measurements of the}} pixel density (resolution) of an electronic image <b>device,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a computer monitor or television display, or image digitizing <b>device</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a camera or image scanner. Horizontal and vertical density are usually the same, as most devices have square pixels, but differ on devices that have non-square pixels.|$|R

5|$|Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) is an {{adaptation}} of HDMI intended to connect mobile <b>devices</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> smartphones and tablets to high-definition televisions (HDTVs) and displays. Unlike DVI, which is compatible with HDMI using only passive cables and adapters, MHL requires that the HDMI socket be MHL-enabled, otherwise an active adapter (or dongle) is required to convert the signal to HDMI. MHL is developed by a consortium of five consumer electronics manufacturers, several of which are also behind HDMI.|$|E
5|$|Photons {{have many}} {{applications}} in technology.
