In the same section, a subsequent line names the track [...] "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da", a Paul McCartney composition that would also appear on The Beatles. In this way, [...] "Savoy Truffle" [...] continued a tradition initiated by John Lennon in 1967, particularly in his lyrics to [...] "I Am the Walrus", whereby the Beatles deliberately quoted from their previous songs.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{turning to}} feature filmmaking, Tsui was quickly typed {{as a member}} of the [...] "New Wave" [...] of young, iconoclastic directors. His debut film, The Butterfly Murders (1979), was an {{eccentric}} and technically challenging blend of wuxia, murder mystery and science fiction / fantasy elements. His second film, We're Going to <b>Eat</b> <b>You</b> (1980), was an eccentric blend of cannibal horror, black comedy and martial arts.|$|E

Life is so beautiful!" [...] In 1930, Pascal returned to France, to work strictly in the academic field. He privately decried Soviet rule, arguing: [...] "No regime has ever been a regime of lies to this extent." ...|$|E

Desperate, Kubera rushed to mount Kailasa to ask Shiva to remedy the situation. The Lord then gave him a handful of roasted rice, saying that {{something as simple as}} a handful of roasted rice would satiate Ganesha, if it were offered with humility and love. Ganesha had swallowed up almost the entire city when Kubera finally arrived and humbly gave him the rice. With that, Ganesha was finally satisfied and calmed.|$|E
2500|$|A Frenchman, a German, and a Russian go on a safari and are {{captured}} by cannibals. They {{are brought to}} the chief, who says, [...] "We are going to <b>eat</b> <b>you</b> right now. But I am a civilized man, I studied human rights at the Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, so I'll grant each of you a last request." [...] The German asks for a mug of beer and a bratwurst. He gets it, and then the cannibals eat him. The Frenchman asks for three girls. He has crazy sex with them, and then suffers {{the fate of the}} German. The Russian demands: [...] "Hit me hard, right on my nose!" [...] The chief is surprised, but hits him. The Russian pulls out a Kalashnikov and shoots all the cannibals. The mortally-wounded chief asks him: [...] "Why didn't you do this before we ate the German?" [...] The Russian proudly replies: [...] "Russians are not aggressors!" [...] (This joke has also been used as a Jewish joke; more specifically, as an Israeli joke, alluding to Israel's being constantly afraid of being seen as the [...] "aggressor".) ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 29, 2006 Sec. Donald Rumsfeld said “Over {{the next}} decades , a {{sentiment}} took root that contended that {{if only the}} growing threats that had begun to emerge in Europe and Asia could be accommodated, then the carnage {{and the destruction of}} then-recent memory of World War I could be avoided. It was a time when a certain amount of cynicism and moral confusion set in among Western democracies. When those who warned about a coming crisis, the rise of fascism and nazism, they were ridiculed or ignored. Indeed, in the decades before World War II, a great many argued that the fascist threat was exaggerated or that it was someone else's problem. Some nations tried to negotiate a separate peace, even as the enemy made its deadly ambitions crystal clear. It was, as Winston Churchill observed, a bit like feeding a crocodile, hoping it would <b>eat</b> <b>you</b> last. ...I recount that history because once again we face similar challenges in efforts to confront the rising threat of a new type of fascism. Today -- another enemy, a different kind of enemy -- has made clear its intentions with attacks in places like New York and Washington, D.C., Bali, London, Madrid, Moscow and so many other places. But some seem not to have learned history's lessons. ...With the growing lethality and the increasing availability of weapons, can we truly afford to believe that somehow, some way, vicious extremists can be appeased? Can folks really continue to think that free countries can negotiate a separate peace with terrorists?" ...|$|E
