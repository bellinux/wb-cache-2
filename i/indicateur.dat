But the whole business was so interesting that I found it possible to make that concentration. Essentially warfare is a game of elaborate but witty problems in precaution and anticipation, with amazing scope for invention. You so saturate your mind with the facts and possibilities of the situation that intuitions emerge. It did not do to think of anything beyond those facts and possibilities and dodges and counterdodges, for to do so was to let in irrelevant and distracting lights. During all that concluding year of service I {{was not so much}} myself as a forced and artificial thing I made out of myself to meet the special needs of the time. I became a Boer-outwitting animal. When I was tired of this specialized thinking, then the best relief, I found, was some quite trivial occupation--playing poker, yelling in the chorus of some interminable song one of the men would sing, or coining South African Limericks or playing burlesque bouts-rimés with Fred Maxim, who was then my second in command....|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} an elliptic variational inequality with discontinuous coefficients arising in unilateral contact mechanics in linearized elasticity. The contact zone is an internal boundary separating sub-domains with difference elastic properties. We study some discrete formulations with mixed finite element methods and we give optimal error estimates in appropriate norms, {{independent of the}} variation of the elasticity coefficients. The focus of the article is the a posteriori analysis with residual error indicators. It is achieved both for the conforming and nonconforming discretization, in a unified framework. The residual error indicators are well suited to handle non-matching meshes and the contact conditions, and they allow us to obtain sharp and robust a posteriori estimates. An adaptive solution algorithm is proposed and few numerical experiments confirming the theory are presented.

50|$|The first {{semaphore}} telegraphy {{line was}} established in 1794 between Paris and Lille. The French network extended over 5,000 km with 534 stations serving 29 towns. Installed in 1834, the line linking Avignon to Narbonne, via Valros, was functioning until 1853. The semaphore network was then replaced by electric telegraphy. The tours de Chappe (Chappe towers), every 12 km or so, were built on high points. Each station was equipped with a mechanism for transmission and two telescopes to receive a message and to control its onward transmission. The mechanism consisted of a vertical mast supporting a 4.60 m long movable arm, the regulateur. At {{either end of the}} latter was a secondary arm, 2 m long, the <b>indicateurs.</b> The mast extended down into the interior of the tower into a tight room, 3 m by 3 m, sheltering the stationnaire, the solitary worker glued to his telescopes. For speed, and confidentiality, messages were encoded using a table where each figure signified a word or phrase. To transmit a message, the regulateur was placed either horizontally or vertically. The <b>indicateurs</b> were articulated every 45o, with 7 positions for each. This gave a total of 98 combinations (7 X 7 X 2), of which six were reserved for the service - the only ones whose meanings were known to the stationnaire. The total repertoire of messages was, therefore, 92 pages of 92 lines, a total of 8,464. Signals were sent in groups of two: the first number for the number of the page, the second for the number of the line on that page.|$|R

In particular the school enrolment of children aged 7 to 13 is found to depend on remittances income accruing to the sub-group he/she belongs to and not on the remittances accruing to other sub-groups. Looking at total expenditures, we also find that transfers received by a sub-group are a significant determinant of its own consumption, contrarily to transfers received by other groups.
