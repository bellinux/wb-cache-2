She told the court that the CCTV footage of a person on Thistle Street bore enough similarities to other CCTV images of Suzanne Pilley taken that day, <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it definitely was Ms Pilley. She was 20 metres from the entrance to her work.|$|E
25|$|This {{consists}} of an India-rubber contrivance which the female easily adjusts in the vagina before copulation, and which spreads a thin tissue of rubber before {{the mouth of the}} womb so as to prevent the seminal aura from entering. … Conception cannot possibly take place when it is used. The full enjoyment of the conjugal embrace can be indulged in during coition. The husband would hardly be likely to know that it was being used, unless told by the wife. … It places conception entirely {{under the control of the}} wife, to whom it naturally belongs; for it is <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> at what time and under what circumstances, she will become the mother, and the moral, religious, and physical instructress of offspring.|$|E
25|$|In May 2016, Peggy {{returns to}} the Square having been {{diagnosed}} with terminal breast cancer. She decides to stop her treatment, but Phil tries to change her mind, enlisting the help of Sharon. Sharon then calls Grant in Portugal, leaving a voicemail saying that his family needs him. Grant {{returns to the}} square soon after and walks in on Phil and Peggy. He plans to take Peggy with him back to Portugal, only <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that her cancer has returned. Grant is angry when she reveals that she had planned to tell him and Sam through letters to them after she died, and that she plans to commit suicide. Phil and Grant seemingly convince Peggy not to do this. Grant tells Phil he needs the money that he lent him immediately but knows he cannot get it so threatens him unless he returns the money. Grant then returns to Portugal, only for Sharon to call him again to inform him that Peggy has killed herself. When Sam returns to Walford for Peggy's funeral, she reveals that Grant is unable {{to come to the}} funeral.|$|E

6000|$|However, {{it was not}} to be {{expected}} that a private conference should last long in that house, and Mysie appeared at that moment, looking <b>for</b> <b>her</b> cousin, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that 'Mamma was ready for her.' Dolores went off with more alacrity than usual, and Uncle Reginald beckoned up his other niece, and observed: 'I say, Mysie, what's the matter with Dolly?' ...|$|R
500|$|In 1985, she {{audition}}ed for a guest spot as Cynthia in Cheers. The audition called <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> her line and {{walk off the}} set. Cartwright {{decided to take a}} chance on being different and continued walking, leaving the building and returning home. The production crew was confused, but she received the part. In search of more training as an actress, Cartwright joined a class taught by Hollywood coach Milton Katselas. He recommended that Cartwright study La Strada, a 1956 Italian film starring Giulietta Masina and directed by Federico Fellini. She began performing [...] "every imaginable scene" [...] from La Strada in her class and spent several months trying to secure the rights to produce a stage adaptation. She visited Italy with the intention of meeting Fellini and requesting his permission in person. Although they never met, Cartwright kept a journal of the trip and later wrote a one-woman play called In Search of Fellini, partially based on her voyage. The play was co-written by Peter Kjenaas, and Cartwright won a Drama-Logue Award after performing it in Los Angeles in 1995. In a 1998 interview, she stated her intention to make it into a feature film, which she succeeded in doing in 2017.|$|E
500|$|Wood {{has stated}} that Steffy refuses to give Liam up because of {{everything}} she has been through and lost. She said, [...] "It’s hard <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye and {{hard for her to}} leave...She wants somebody there but she is very broken inside." [...] After years of uncertainty, in which Liam is involved with Hope and Steffy, married to Steffy twice, never legally married to Hope, Steffy becomes pregnant with his child in 2013. Wood was shocked, and said that Steffy is a [...] "wild child" [...] who likes to go to nightclubs and ride motorcycles, but [...] "everything just stops" [...] with her pregnancy. Initially, Steffy does not tell Liam about the baby because she sees him in bed with Hope, and leaves for Paris. Liam discovers the truth and he marries Steffy at the Forrester Mansion. Just before discovering Steffy is carrying his child, Liam nearly marries Hope in a [...] "room service elopement" [...] scheme arranged by Brooke; an ambush that was described as [...] "evil" [...] by Daytime Confidential. Wood felt that Steffy is more mature and level-headed {{as a result of her}} pregnancy. Steffy later loses the child in a motorbike accident, and becomes unconscious.|$|E

5000|$|Shirley's husband, who {{was angry}} and {{confused}} at <b>her</b> departure, waits <b>for</b> <b>her</b> return {{with a large}} armful of flowers. He is shocked and embarrassed to find Shirley chose to stay and isn't on the plane, and repeatedly calls her, pleading and arguing <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> return, <b>saying</b> that it is her place and she is embarrassing him, or telling her that her actions result from a mid-life crisis or menopause.|$|R
6000|$|Would the Lord Chancellor {{be after}} {{her if she}} did? Her heart quite yearned for those games, or even {{to be able to}} talk to one of those little damsels; and one day when a bright-faced girl ran after her with a piece of weed that she had dropped, she could hardly say [...] "thank you" [...] <b>for</b> <b>her</b> longing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> more; and many were the harangues she {{composed}} within herself to warn the others not to wish to change places with <b>her,</b> <b>for</b> <b>to</b> be a countess was very poor fun indeed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where in thunder is she?" [...] growled Tom, {{walking off}} in high dudgeon. The quick tap of feet behind him made him turn {{in time to}} see a fresh-faced little girl running down the long station, and looking as if she rather liked it. As she smiled, and waved her bag at him, he stopped and waited <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> himself, [...] "Hullo! I wonder if that 's Polly?" ...|$|R
60|$|It seemed {{impossible}} <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a gracious thing. Philip cursed the fate which chained him {{to such a}} woman. She went away to fetch his tea.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} always agreed," [...] Isabel smiled in return. She felt she could smile now; {{she had seen}} in an instant, in Mr. Bantling's brave eyes, that he had good news <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> They seemed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he wished <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{remember}} {{he was an old}} friend of her cousin--that he understood, that it was all right. Isabel gave him her hand; she thought of him, extravagantly, as a beautiful blameless knight.|$|R
50|$|That night, Hannah confronts Tom to {{ask about}} the kiss. When she gets <b>to</b> his room, <b>her</b> drunk cousin is there, trying to have sex with him. Hannah leaves and Tom runs after her. He knocks on <b>her</b> door, {{pleading}} <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> let him in. She refuses and asks about the kiss. He tells her he knew he, not Colin, was the one <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She refuses <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that she thinks so too and instead tells Tom that she still expects to marry Colin the next day. Tom cannot go through with watching Hannah and Colin get married so he decides to go home.|$|R
60|$|Lily, who remembered {{accurately}} all {{the passages}} {{of her last}} interview with John Eames, said nothing, but felt, in some sort, sore {{at the idea that}} he should be so near her at such a time. In some unconscious way she had liked him <b>for</b> coming <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and <b>saying</b> all that he did say. She valued him more highly after that scene than she did before. But now, she would feel herself injured and hurt if he ever made his way into her presence under circumstances as they existed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let her then. It {{would be}} much better than always living at daggers-drawn with one's brother.' Then, after waiting <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something, he added, 'If you won't go with me, I shall go alone.' ...|$|E
60|$|The conference {{ended in}} a promise on Miss Baker's part that she, at least, would say nothing against Mr. George; but with an assurance, also, that it was {{impossible}} <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything in his favour.|$|E
60|$|Lady Arabella would {{probably}} have said this, also, had she dared; but she felt, that in doing so, she would be going too far. It was useless <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything that would be utterly contradicted by an appeal to Mary herself.|$|E

When the two cross paths one night after separately having drunk a drugged liquid a comedy of errors occurs.

6000|$|Nevertheless {{he thought}} he could prove that the {{necklace}} was first put into Lizzie's hands in London. The middle-aged and very discreet man at Messrs. Garnett's, who had given up the jewel-case to Sir Florian, was sure that he had known Sir Florian to be a married man when he did so. The lady's maid who had been in Scotland with Lady Eustace, and who was now living in Turin, having married a courier, had given evidence before an Italian man of law, stating that she had never seen the necklace till she came to London. There were, moreover, the probabilities of the case. Was it likely that Sir Florian should take such a thing down in his pocket to Scotland? And there was the statement as first made by Lady Eustace herself <b>to</b> <b>her</b> cousin Frank, repeated by him to John Eustace, and not to be denied by any one. It was all very well <b>for</b> <b>her</b> now <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that she had forgotten; but would any one believe that on such a subject she could forget? ...|$|R
6000|$|Manse {{servants}} {{of the most}} admired kind move softly, as if constant contact with a minister were goloshes to them; but Jean was new and raw, only having got her place because her father might be an elder any day. She had already conceived a romantic affection <b>for</b> <b>her</b> master; but <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "sir" [...] to him-as she thirsted to do--would have been as difficult <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as <b>to</b> swallow oysters.

5000|$|The term [...] "owned" [...] {{subsequently}} {{spread to}} gaming circles, {{where it was}} used to refer the subservient relationship of South Carolina Gamecocks to the Clemson Tigers, also known as the Univetsuty in South Carolina.. For example, if a player makes a particularly impressive kill shot or wins a match by an appreciable margin in a multiplayer video game, it is not uncommon <b>for</b> him or <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> owned <b>to</b> the loser(s), as a manifestation of victory, a taunt, or provocation. Ownage has become a modern equivalent to a [...] "Turkey shoot", such as an experienced faction versus a beginner or disadvantaged faction. In slang form, owned can be an adjective (He is owned), owning can be a verb (He is totally owning that guy.), and ownage can be a noun.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{how would}} you {{describe}} a Connecticut winter to a Hottentot? Not that you're a Hottentot"--the voice broke into an oily chuckle--"or that I'm in a cold climate."

She asked me <b>to</b> manifest <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She <b>says</b> <b>to</b> trust this girl and to carry a message of love to Henry.

60|$|Her voice, {{from having}} been tremulous, had become full and firm.

5000|$|Roser {{has stated}} that it is <b>for</b> others, not <b>her,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what {{tradition}} <b>her</b> art belongs to; yet many critics categorize her work as abstract. Abstract art focuses on what a person sees; i.e. color, shape, size, and scale, thus, it does not directly depict objects in the visible world. [...] Roser’s work exemplifies the idea that art is {{a bridge between the}} verbal and pre-verbal world, a blending of the reality and perception of life. [...] Roser believes that the “communication of painting can express the architecture, landscape, aerial views, free associations, random choices and unexpected juxtapositions of perceptions and feelings that constitute life experience.” [...] Roser’s abstraction and distinct style of purposefully using colors has been described as “suggesting a symbolic language of earth and mountain topography.” [...] That critique continues on <b>to</b> stress that <b>her</b> work is a great example of “perception shifts” and her abstraction is able to “engage the viewer through ambiguity.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a village}} in Holland, two American vaudevillians, Con and Kid, who have been {{travelling}} in Europe but itch {{to get back to}} New York, are stranded penniless in the little inn. As painters and their models sing about the troubles of being a poor artist, the models try to convince the painters to quit their work and have some fun ("By the Side of the Mill"). Overhearing the models complaining, Tina points out that at least the girls have boyfriends. Prompted by this statement Flora discloses that she longs <b>for</b> <b>her</b> painter <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he loves her, and will one day, marry her ("Loved But Me"). Con and Kid try to sneak out of the inn without paying their bill, but they are discovered and sent to jail. The Innkeeper takes pity on them, however, and arranges for them to work at the inn to pay off their debt. [...] The Burgomaster's daughter, Gretchen, loves Captain Doris van Damm. Her father, however, wishes <b>her</b> <b>to</b> marry the Governor of Zeeland. Con and Kid agree to help Gretchen and the Captain to elope. Willem tells the Burgomaster about this plot, and he locks Gretchen in the windmill. The Americans try <b>to</b> rescue <b>her,</b> but the Burgomaster has made all arrangements for the marriage between his daughter to the governor. Plotting with Tina, the two Americans finally help Gretchen to escape and then they appear at the wedding festivities (which are missing the bride) disguised as Sherlock Holmes and Watson to [...] "help" [...] Burgomaster find his daughter. Bertha replaces Gretchen as the bride, marries the Governor (her childhood sweetheart), and her identity is then revealed. It turns out, luckily, that Captain Van Damm is heir to a large fortune.
