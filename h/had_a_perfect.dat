5|$|The 1948 Cleveland Browns {{season was}} the team's {{third in the}} All-America Football Conference (AAFC). After winning the AAFC crown in 1946 and 1947, the league's {{first two years of}} existence, the Browns {{repeated}} as champions in 1948 and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> season, winning all of their games.|$|E
5|$|By the team's {{following}} season, Adamle {{was being}} used mostly on defense as a left-side linebacker, and Motley was again the primary fullback. Cleveland <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> season in 1948, winning all of its games and beating the Buffalo Bills in the championship. Adamle had 88 rushing {{yards and a touchdown}} that year.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the season, the Browns <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> 14–0 {{record and}} led the league's Western Division, setting up a {{championship}}-game matchup with the Bills, who had won a playoff to take the Eastern Division. Cleveland beat Buffalo 49–7 in December to win the championship and preserve its unbeaten record. After the season, Graham, Motley and Speedie were included in many news organizations' All-Pro teams, alongside several other teammates. Graham was named the co-Most Valuable Player of the league alongside Albert. Browns games were televised {{for the first time in}} 1948.|$|E

5|$|Notre Dame {{continued}} to succeed under Parseghian {{in the early}} 1970s. Led by senior quarterback Joe Theismann, the team {{finished second in the}} polls in 1970 and avenged its Cotton Bowl loss, defeating the Longhorns 24–11 in an upset. In 1973, Parseghian <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> season and won a second national championship, topped off by a 24–23 win over Alabama in the Sugar Bowl. Both teams were undefeated going into the game, but Alabama had held the top spot in the national polls. Parseghian was named coach of the year after the season by Football News.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the Colts had {{a greatly}} {{improved}} defense over that of recent years. Combining this with their offense, they won their first 13 games, including a 40–21 rout of the two-time defending Super Bowl champions, New England. This was Manning's first road win against the Patriots in eight attempts, {{and his three}} touchdown passes earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. By Week 15, the Colts <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> 13–0 record, and had secured the AFC South and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Nevertheless, head coach Tony Dungy {{made the decision to}} play all of his regular starters against the Chargers. However, the Colts played a sub-par game against the Chargers and fell short of the win; the score was 26–17. Manning finished the 2005 season with , {{the first time he had}} thrown for under 4,000yards since his rookie season in 1998, largely because Manning sat out much of the final two games with the top AFC seed clinched. His quarterback rating of 104.1 was the highest in the league for the season.|$|E
5|$|Paciorek, {{who was the}} {{starting}} right fielder, began {{the day with a}} walk in the second inning. He then had a single in the fourth inning, which drove in Rusty Staub and Bob Aspromonte. After singling and again bringing home Aspromonte in the fifth, Paciorek had a walk in the sixth, and ended the day with a leadoff single in the eighth. In total, he went to the plate five times and hit three singles and had two walks, scoring four runs en route to a 134 Houston victory over the New York Mets. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> major league career batting average and on-base percentage of 1.000 {{as a result of his}} performance that day, something no one else with as many plate appearances as Paciorek has done.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez did {{not stay}} in the bullpen very long though. After Randy Johnson {{strained}} his shoulder, Sánchez was chosen to start against the San Diego Padres on July 10. In that game, Sánchez not only threw the first complete game and the first shutout of his career; he threw a no-hitter, becoming the first Giants' pitcher to do so since John Montefusco no-hit the Atlanta Braves in 1976. In the process, Sánchez struck out a new career high of eleven batters. Sánchez <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> game going into the eighth inning, but an error by Juan Uribe allowed the only baserunner of the night. Sánchez almost lost the no-hitter during the ninth inning when Edgar Gonzalez hit a ball deep to centerfield. However, Aaron Rowand made a spectacular catch, and Sánchez got his no-hitter. Sánchez's no-hitter was also special because his father Sigfredo, who had never seen his son start a major league game, was in attendance.|$|E

5|$|The {{two teams}} first played in 1895 and met six more times through 1923. In those early matches, Johns Hopkins scored a {{combined}} sixty points to Maryland's three. In 1924, Maryland fielded its first varsity-level lacrosse team, which defeated Hopkins, 4–2, but the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) awarded the Blue Jays the co-national championship (along with Syracuse). Since that season, the teams have met annually {{with the exception}} of a two-year hiatus due to World War II. Johns Hopkins won three straight national titles from 1926 to 1928, where each season culminated with a victory over Maryland. In 1928, Maryland <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> 9–0 record until Johns Hopkins defeated the Terps in the season finale, 6–3. At season's end, a single-elimination tournament was held to determine which team would represent the United States in a trial lacrosse competition during the Summer Olympics. Maryland defeated Navy and Rutgers to advance to the final game, where they were again bested by Johns Hopkins.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{began his}} National Hockey League (NHL) {{career with the}} Boston Bruins in the 1928–29 season after his {{contract}} was purchased by Boston manager Art Ross. Despite having never seen Thompson play, Ross had heard about Thompson's good reputation in Minnesota. In his first game, he posted a shutout, becoming the only Hockey Hall of Fame goaltender to accomplish this feat. In his first season, he appeared in all 44 of the Bruins' games, posting 12shutouts and a 1.15goals-against average, the second lowest goals-against average in NHL history to date, second to George Hainsworth's 0.98 GAA. Hainsworth set his record that same season. Placing first in the American Division, the Bruins <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> record in the playoffs en route to their first Stanley Cup victory, defeating the Montreal Canadiens and the New York Rangers. Thompson recorded three shutouts in the five playoff games, and allowed only three goals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ninth}} inning, Sad Sam Jones, a 22-year veteran in the American League, {{replaced}} Dutch Ruether, who had replaced pitcher Shawkey. Jones gave up an inside-the-park home run to Thevenow. Thevenow {{had only two}} other home runs in his career, {{both of which were}} inside-the-park and during the 1926 regular season. Jones then walked Douthit and Hornsby and gave up a single to Southworth. With the bases loaded and two outs {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, Bottomley hit a fly ball to center fielder Earle Combs. The Yankees did not score in the bottom of the ninth inning, and lost the game to the Cardinals by a 6–2 score. Alexander pitched a complete game, allowed hits in only two of the nine innings and did not allow a Yankee hit after the third inning. He also had a series-high 10 strikeouts, allowing four hits, one earned run and one walk. Meanwhile, the Yankees' starter Shocker allowed ten hits and five earned runs, including a home run, in seven innings of work. Shawkey <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> inning with two strikeouts, while Jones gave up two hits and allowed two walks in the ninth inning.|$|E

5|$|Rolle {{was forced}} to redshirt the 2007–08 season due to {{transfer}} rules. In his first game as a Bulldog, on November 15, 2008, he registered nine rebounds and eight points, including four consecutive points within the last minute, to propel Louisiana Tech past Louisiana-Lafayette, 61–59. Rolle's first double-double came against Grambling State on November 18, with 12 points and 14 rebounds. He led the team in scoring with a then-career high of 17 points in a blowout 78–55 loss to #10 UCLA on December 28, while also contributing seven rebounds. On January 29, 2009, Rolle <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> night from the field, shooting 11-for-11 with 23 points. In a 60–52 defeat {{at the hands of}} Utah State on February 7, Rolle fell and injured his hip early in the game, but he came back later to finish with eight points. He had a season high 25 points to go along with 11 rebounds and four blocked shots in leading the Bulldogs to a victory over Murray State 69–60 on February 21. In the next game, an 80–71 win over New Mexico State, Rolle equalled his season high in points (25) and grabbed 12 rebounds.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} some {{classes of}} graphs which are easily {{seen to have}} many perfect matchings. Such graphs can be considered robust {{with respect to the}} property of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> matching if under vertex deletions (with some mild restrictions), the resulting subgraph continues to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> matching. It is clear that you can destroy the property of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> matching by deleting an odd number of vertices, by upsetting a bipartition or by deleting enough vertices to create an odd component. One class of graphs we consider is the m×m lattice graph (or grid graph) for m even. Matchings in such grid graphs correspond to coverings of an m×m checkerboard by dominoes. If in addition to the easy conditions above, we require that the deleted vertices be Θ(m) apart, the resulting graph <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> matching. The second class of graphs we consider is a k-fold product graph consisting of k copies of a given graph G with the ith copy joined to the i+ 1 st copy by <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> matching joining copies of the same vertex. We show that, apart from some easy restrictions, we can delete any vertices from the kth copy of G and find <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> matching in the product graph with k suitably large...|$|R
