25|$|An intercooler, was {{required}} to stop the compressed mixture from becoming too hot and either igniting before reaching the cylinders (pre-ignition knocking) or creating a condition known as knocking or detonation. The intercooler, which was separate from the engine cooling system, with its own supply of glycol and water coolant, was mounted in the induction system, between the outlet of the second-stage supercharger and behind the cylinder blocks. The hot air-fuel mixture from the supercharger was circulated though and around the coolant tubes and was then {{passed on to the}} main <b>induction</b> <b>manifold,</b> through which it was fed into the cylinders. The intercooler also circulated coolant through passages in the supercharger casing and between the impellers. Finally, an extra radiator (mounted in the starboard radiator duct under the wing of the Spitfire) was used to dissipate the intercooler's excess charge heat.|$|E

5000|$|... "Coatalen {{produced}} the world’s first twin-cam Six for the 1916 Indianapolis 500" [...] an Ernest Henry prewar Peugeot type in-line six cylinder 81.5x157 mm, capacity 4,914 cc. Two cast blocks of three; twin overhead camshafts {{driven by a}} vertical shaft and gears {{from the front of}} the engine; four valve per cylinder (24 in total), 60 degrees included angle. Camshafts castings split horizontally. Pivoted cam followers carried by bronze mountings. Crankshaft in three pieces carried in four large ball bearings; plain big ends. Drilled aluminum pistons - a first for Sunbeam racing car. Dry sump lubrication with two oil pumps - one for the bearings and the other for the camshafts. Mounted on sub-frame articulated with the chassis. Single Bosch magneto ignition driven at ¾ engine speed. Twin CZS Claudel Hobson carburettors mounted on two water-jacketed <b>induction</b> <b>manifolds.</b> Compression ration 5.8:1, 152 bhp at 3,200 rpm. Two speed gearbox was tried but four speed gearbox with cone clutch generally used; Hotchkiss drive with bevel back axle. Revolution counter driven by the camshaft.|$|R
50|$|Power {{came from}} a more {{powerful}} version of the previous model's 2.1 L (2103 cc/128 in³) Rover IOE straight-6 engine now with chromium-plated cylinder bores, an aluminium cylinder head with built-in <b>induction</b> <b>manifold</b> {{and a pair of}} horizontal instead of downdraught carburetters. A four-speed manual transmission was used with a column-mounted gear lever which was replaced by a floor-mounted mechanism in September 1953.|$|E
50|$|A {{clutch servo}} {{powered by the}} vacuum at the <b>induction</b> <b>manifold</b> {{operated}} the automatic clutch - a conventional clutch incorporating centrifugal operation. A switch in the gear lever operated a solenoid valve {{so that when the}} gear lever was moved the clutch was disengaged. A control unit made throttle adjustments to keep the engine speed matched to the driven clutch plate and also varied the speed of clutch operation appropriate to road speed.|$|E
50|$|Considerable {{work must}} have been done at the new AMC race shop, because the next version did not appear until 1938, and when it did it had a plunger rear suspension, better brakes, revised and lighter <b>induction</b> <b>manifold,</b> and raised compression. The engine had been mounted further back in the frame to improve rear {{cylinder}} cooling. A R (Bob) Foster rode one in the 1938 Senior Isle of Man TT, but it retired, from overheating, after only two laps.|$|E
50|$|The early R Type Continental has {{essentially}} the same engine as the standard R Type, but with modified carburation, <b>induction</b> and exhaust <b>manifolds</b> along with higher gear ratios.

5000|$|The [...] "plain wrapper" [...] 1969 Plymouth Road Runner, {{that was}} Motor Trend magazine's Car of the Year, was {{modified}} {{with the addition}} of a high-performance factory camshaft plus non-standard, high-performance <b>induction</b> and exhaust <b>manifolds,</b> carburetor, and slick tires to run a 14.7 quarter at 100.6 mph with its 383 CID L engine. In this customized form, the car cost US$3,893. In 1968, Dodge's $3,027 Super Bee ran a 15-second quarter at 100 mph on street tires with the same engine, only stock.|$|R
50|$|The 383 cuin L B engine—not to be {{confused}} with the RB version— was essentially a larger bore version of the 350 and 361, using a 4.21 in bore. This venerable engine was introduced in 1959. Dodge's version, the D500 had a cross-ram <b>induction</b> <b>manifold</b> and dual 4-barrel carburetors as options. In some Dodge applications, this engine was labeled as the Magnum, while the Plymouth's version was called the Golden Commando. Both came with a dual point distributor in high-performance versions.|$|E
50|$|In November 1915 {{both the}} valves and the <b>induction</b> <b>manifold</b> were enlarged. The factory claimed for this a marked {{increase}} in power saying their regular test hill {{with a maximum}} gradient of one in six previously required the use of third gear but could now be climbed unfaltering on top gear. There had been no change in gear ratios. The radiator was enlarged and each water jacket beside the exhaust valve port was now separately fed by a large diameter external lead direct from the water pump.|$|E
50|$|Tatra {{used their}} {{air-cooled}} V8 engines from 1934, when introduced Tatra 77 (first serial-produced aerodynamically designed car). These {{culminated in the}} 2.5 L unit used in the Tatra T603 range of cars. The most powerful of these was fitted to the racing variant — known as the B-5. This was a higher compression version of the standard engine which replaced a standard single 2BBL carburettor with two 4BBL downdraft units on a new <b>induction</b> <b>manifold.</b> Tatra later produced another air-cooled engine, used in Tatra 613 and later, in Tatra 700. These engines were well known for their reliability, good fuel consumption, and specific sound.|$|E
40|$|Application of the tumor-promoting agent 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) to mouse skin {{leads to}} a <b>manifold</b> <b>induction</b> of {{ornithine}} decarboxylase (ODC) activity within 5 hr and an increased accumulation of putrescine. The relevance of these TPA-induced changes to the mechanism of tumor promo tion was investigated using a-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an irreversible inhibitor of ODC. DFMO applied to mouse skin (0. 3 mg in 0. 2 ml of solvent) or administered in the drinking water (1 %) in conjunction with skin tumor promotion by TPA inhibited the formation of mouse skin papillomas by 50 and 90 %, respec tively. TPA-induced ODC activity and the accumulation of pu trescine were almost completely inhibited. DFMO given in the drinking water decreased spermidine levels, but DFMO treatment by any route did not alter the spermine levels of mouse epidermis...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen is a {{clean fuel}} for {{internal}} combustion engines as it produces only water vapor and nitrogen oxides when it burns. In this research, hydrogen {{is used as}} a blending fuel with diesel to reduce pollutants emission and to improve performance. It is inducted in the inlet <b>manifold,</b> (continuous <b>manifold</b> <b>induction),</b> which is of a single cylinder, four stroke, direct injection, variable compression ratio water cold diesel engine, type (Kirloskar). This technique of hydrogen blending is selected because of its simplicity and low cost. Hydrogen blending is built on the basis of energy replacement. A special electronic unit is designed and fabricated to control hydrogen blending ratio. The maximum achieved ratio is 30 % of input energy and beyond that the engine operation becomes unsatisfactory. Tests are done with 17. 5 compression ratio and 1500 rpm. The brake specific fuel consumption is reduced by 29 % and the engine thermal efficiency increased by 16 % at these operating conditions. The pollutant emissions of carbon oxides, UHC, and smoke opacity are dramatically decreased by 19. 5 %, 13 %,and 45 % respectively while NOx emission increased by 10 %...|$|R
5000|$|The 428 Super Cobra Jet (also {{known as}} the 428SCJ) used the same top end, pistons, {{cylinder}} heads, camshaft, valve train, <b>induction</b> system, exhaust <b>manifolds,</b> and engine block as the 428 Cobra Jet. However, the crankshaft and connecting rods were strengthened and associated balancing altered for drag racing. A nodular iron crankshaft casting #1UA was used as well as heavier 427 [...] "Le Mans" [...] connecting rods with capscrews instead of bolts for greater durability. The heavier connecting rods {{and the removal of}} the centre counterweight on the stock 428 Cobra Jet crankshaft (1UA), required an external weight on the snout of the crankshaft for balancing. A 428 Super Cobra Jet engine with oil cooler was standard equipment when the [...] "Drag Pack" [...] option (which came when selecting either a 3.91 or 4.30 rear end gear ratio) was ordered with cars manufactured from 13 November 1968. In addition, while the CJ and SCJ engines used the same autothermic piston casting, the piston-to-bore clearance specification between the CJ and SCJ 428 engines is slightly different, with the SCJ engines gaining a slightly looser fit to permit higher operating temperature. Horsepower measurements at a street rpm level remained the same. The 428 Super Cobra Jet engine was never offered with factory air conditioning due to the location of its engine oil cooler.|$|R

50|$|Ethylene glycol coolant was {{circulated}} by a pump {{through this}} passage {{to carry off}} the excess heat generated by the impellers. Without the intercooler {{the temperature of the}} charge could be as high as 400 °F (204 °C). The intercooler in itself was not adequate to deal with the high temperature and an additional cooling fin and tube core was placed between the outlet of the blower and the <b>induction</b> <b>manifold</b> to the cylinders. This radiator was known as an aftercooler and served as a reservoir for the supercharger cooling system. The glycol mixture used for cooling was independent of the main engine cooling system and used a centrifugal pump driven by the engine to circulate the coolant through an aircraft radiator system at a maximum rate of 36 U.S. gallons (136 litres, 30 Imperial gallons) per minute, depending on engine rpm. This combined system reduced the charge temperature to suitable levels.|$|E
5000|$|The bench {{front seat}} was trimmed in PVC, and the {{handbrake}} was operated by an umbrella-style pull lever under the facia (dash). The windscreen wipers used the antiquated vacuum system, {{but it came}} from a vacuum pump linked to the camshaft-driven fuel pump instead of the <b>induction</b> <b>manifold</b> as on Ford's earlier applications of this arrangement. Clearly keen to keep things positive, a 1950 road test by the British Autocar magazine reported that the wipers were [...] "free from the disadvantage of early suction-driven wipers that dried up at wide throttle opening ... and spared the battery". [...] The initial dashboard was a flat, symmetrical panel with interchangeable instrument cluster and glovebox, but from September 1952, a redesigned asymmetrical dashboard was fitted, and the instruments, consisting of speedometer, ammeter, and fuel gauge, were positioned in a housing above the steering column, with a full-width parcel shelf on which an optional radio could be placed.|$|E
5000|$|Rover later {{developed}} a derivative {{of the engine}} by fitting twin SU carburettors and a re-designed top end and marketed the revised specification vehicles as the 2000 TC. The 2000 TC was launched in March 1966 for export markets in North America and continental Europe. Limited availability of the redesigned <b>induction</b> <b>manifold</b> needed for the twin-carburetter engine was given as one reason for restricting the 2000 TC to overseas sales. The manufacturers also stated pointedly that the UK's recently introduced blanket 70 mph (113 km/h) speed limit would make the extra speed of the new car superfluous on the domestic market. Fortunately for performance-oriented UK buyers, supplies of the redesigned inlet manifold must have improved and the company relented {{in time for the}} London Motor Show in October 1966 when the 2000 TC became available for the UK market. The 2000 TC prototypes had run in the Rally of Great Britain as part of their test programme. It featured a bigger starter motor and tachometer as standard and was identifiable by [...] "TC" [...] initials on the bodywork. The power output of the 2000 TC engine was around [...] The standard specification engines continued in production in vehicles designated as 2000 SC models. These featured the original single SU.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work investigates {{the use of}} neat paradise tree oil in a 4 -stroke natural aspirated direct injection compression ignition engine assisted {{with the help of}} super-heated hydrogen (hydrogen in gaseous state or above its saturation temperature) as a combustion improver. The high calorific gaseous fuel hydrogen gas was used as a combustion improver and admitted into the engine during the suction stroke. A 4 -stroke single cylinder Diesel engine was chosen and its operating parameters were suitably modified. Neat paradise tree oil was admitted through standard injector of the engine and hydrogen was admitted through <b>induction</b> <b>manifold.</b> Inducted super-heated hydrogen was initiated the intermediate compounds combustion of neat paradise tree oil. This process offers higher temperature combustion and results in complete combustion of heavier molecules of neat paradise tree oil within shorter duration. The results of the experiment reveal that 40 % higher NOx, 20 % lower smoke, 5 % lower CO, and 45 % lower HC than that of neat paradise tree oil fuel operation and the admission of superheated hydrogen has improved the combustion characteristics of neat paradise tree oil. The investigation successfully proved that the application of neat paradise tree oil with 15 % of hydrogen improver is possible under a regular Diesel engine with minimal engine modification...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to see if}} the pressure pulses which propagate through all automobile <b>induction</b> <b>manifold</b> could be simulated using a computer generated signal fed into amplified speakers attached to a bench mounted intake manifold. It was found that the two measured time domain signals compared favourably to the predicted theoretical time domain curve. The small differences in the experimentally generated time domain signal were accounted to non-linearities in the performance of the speakers used to generate the pressure pulses. The calculated mean {{and standard deviations for the}} two measured time signals also compared favourably which was further reinforced by the determination of the correlation coefficient and covariance of the two signals. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis provided analogous results between the predicted theoretical and two measured signals with a fundamental frequency at approximately 80 Hz and second and third harmonics occurring at 160 Hz and 240 Hz respectively. While the pressure pulses produced by the experimental simulation model at 2400 RPM closely paralleled the results produced by the theoretical model and actual engine, it is recommended that additional tests be performed at different RPMs. This would, however, require speakers better capable of producing lower frequencies and a faster computer in order to simultaneously generate the pressure signal and perform all analysis in real time.
