40|$|The {{electrode}} column {{is the heart}} of the submerged arc furnace. Superior electrode performance provides im-proved furnace performance. This paper describes the main features of the {{electrode column}} that delivers su-perior performance in furnaces worldwide, developed by Pyromet. Pyromet’s electrode comprises the compact slipping device, lower electrode assembly, upper and lower mantles, self-adjusting electrode seal, paste heaters, and Pyromet’s patented innovative <b>electrode</b> <b>breakage</b> detection and length determination system. Pyromet’s slipping device features compact interlocking clamping rings, incorporating fail-safe spring-loaded design. The interlocked clamping rings distribute the clamping force over a larger area of the elec-trode casing, preventing damage. The slipping device assembly features a low maintenance modular design that allows rapid slipping cycle times, back slipping, and compatibility with Pyromet’s <b>electrode</b> <b>breakage</b> de-tection and length determination system. Pyromet’s lower electrode assembly consists of the contact shoes, pressure bellows, pressure ring and heat shields. The contact shoes and pressure ring are designed for long, trouble free operation whilst the pressure bellow configuration equalise contact pressure and current distribution. Furthermore, the contact shoes in...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} the {{development}} of an electro-discharge machining (EDM) block electrode method for the fabrication of microelectrodes with symmetrical sections, e. g. tapered, circularly stepped, rectangular and triangular. In the EDM process, a newly developed machining strategy is applied for the fabrication of microfeatures. The machining is carried out with multi-pass machining to reduce the volume of material removed, and thus to reduce the possibility of <b>electrode</b> <b>breakage.</b> This is especially of significance when the electrode size is of micrometer scale. This strategy is found to be feasible for producing microelectrodes of various symmetrical sections down to a few tens of micrometers. We demonstrate a few applications of fabricated microelectrodes, including tapered, rectangular and triangular microhole arrays. In addition, we have attempted a case study of the micromachining of a microlens-like array mold and we assess its distribution of accuracy. Thus, this work also contributes to the extension of the micro die-sinking EDM process capabilities by applying different strategies for on-the-machine machining of microelectrodes and microstructures...|$|E
40|$|Some years ago, Ferroatlantica {{developed}} {{a new type of}} electrode known as the ELSA electrode. In this elec-trode there is a central graphite core that provides support, surrounded by an annulus of Søderberg paste that gets baked during operation. This technology has been implemented on several silicon furnaces around the world, and was reported on during the previous Infacon conference. In all electrodes, but particularly in the ELSA electrode, the quality and consistency of the paste are impor-tant for correct operation. As the type of paste varies between customers and between countries, Ferroatlan-tica has {{developed a}} quality control procedure for their customers of this technology. This procedure is geared to {{the point of view of}} the customer rather than the paste producer. The analysis is based on the desired flow pattern of the raw paste and on the desired mechanical and electrical properties of the baked paste, as expe-rience has shown that these are the most important parameters to monitor in order to avoid having problems with the resulting electrodes. This paper discusses these methods of paste analysis in the light of complemen-tary studies that have been done when there has been an <b>electrode</b> <b>breakage</b> in the different plants. 1...|$|E
40|$|Direct current (DC) arc {{furnaces}} {{have been}} used extensively in the steel recycling industry, and are seeing increased application in areas related to primary production of steel and ferro-alloys. The DC plasma arc is a high-temperature (20, 000 K), high-velocity (up to km/s) jet of ionized gas, providing thermal energy and mechanical stirring to the raw materials fed to the furnace. Operational situations arising in DC arc furnaces include the melting of a solid charge of material {{at the start of}} a heat, <b>electrode</b> <b>breakages,</b> uneven melting, and liquid materials, all of which may result in uneven surfaces for the arc to interact with. This in turn causes undesirable transient effects such as electrical noise, arc instability, or extinction. The results of computational modelling of the plasma arc system are presented here, and include qualitative experimental evidence of arc behaviour on irregular surfaces from high-speed photography...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} the incidence of lead fracture in patients with DBS {{over a long period of}} time. We present a retrospective study of 208 patients who received 387 DBS electrodes. Fourteen patients had sixteen lead fractures (4 % of the implanted leads) and two patients suffered from 2 lead fractures. Of all lead fractures, five patients had the connection between the leads and the extension cables located in mastoids region, ten in cervical area and one in thoracic region. The mean distance from the connection between the electrode and the extension cable and the lead fracture was 10. 7 [*]mm. The lead fracture is a common, although long-term complication in DBS surgery. In our experience, the most common site of <b>electrode</b> cable <b>breakage</b> is approximately between 9 and 13 [*]mm from the junction between the lead and the extension cable. The most important cause of lead fracture is the rotational movement of the lead-extension cable system.

40|$|Good {{operation}} of Soderberg electrodes {{is dependent upon}} high quality electrode paste coupled with better electrode management procedures. Without having a good electrode operation, {{it is not possible}} to obtain the best outcome from the furnace. In other words that is a good way to say how important the proper electrode operation is. Good electrode performance depends on the slipping rate and current levels, which decides the shape of the baking curve at the level of just below the contact clamps. Negative curvature of baking zone in the central part is considered dangerous because shrinkage takes place outwardly creating abnormal stresses in the <b>electrode.</b> Soft <b>breakages</b> occur when the baking zone comes below the clamps and the casing cannot take the current. This paper deals with various factors affecting baking characteristics leading to soft breakages and also presents case studies in a closed 48 MVA furnace with smelting for charge chrome. In case studies in a closed furnace, it has happened that the energy for baking at the low current operation before breakage has been lower than the actual slipping has demanded. At low current there should not be problem, but a problem can occur when the current for some period is raised above the current carrying ca-pacity of the casing. So data for electrode operation in actual period was studied and presented in this paper. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: We have {{previously}} reported the efficacy {{and safety of}} bilateral pallidal stimulation for primary generalised dystonia in a prospective, controlled, multicentre study with 1 year of follow-up. Although long-term results have been reported by other groups, no controlled assessment of motor and non-motor results is available. In this prospective multicentre 3 year follow-up study, involving the same patients as those enrolled in the 1 year follow-up study, we assessed the effect of bilateral pallidal stimulation on motor impairment, disability, quality of life, cognitive performance, and mood. METHODS: We studied 22 patients with primary generalised dystonia after 3 years of bilateral pallidal stimulation. We compared outcome at 3 years with their status preoperatively and after 1 year of treatment. Standardised video recordings were scored by an independent expert. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. FINDINGS: Motor improvement observed at 1 year (51 %) was maintained at 3 years (58 %). The improvement in quality of life (SF- 36 questionnaire) {{was similar to that}} observed at 1 year. Relative to baseline and to the 1 year assessment, cognition and mood were unchanged 3 years after surgery, but slight improvements were noted in concept formation, reasoning, and executive functions. Pallidal stimulation was stopped bilaterally in three patients because of lack of improvement, technical dysfunction, and infection, and unilaterally in two patients because of <b>electrode</b> <b>breakage</b> and stimulation-induced contracture. No permanent adverse effects were observed. INTERPRETATION: Bilateral pallidal stimulation provides sustained motor benefit after 3 years. Mild long-term improvements in quality of life and attention were also observed...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionVagus nerve {{stimulation}} (VNS) {{is an effective}} alternative treatment for patients with partial refractory epilepsy. Nevertheless, information regarding VNS in children is still limited. Materials and methodsThe clinical efficacy, safety and neuropsychological effects of VNS in 34 children (mean age 11. 5 years) with drug-resistant epilepsy were studied. Mean follow-up was 30. 8 months. Nine patients {{have been diagnosed with}} Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome, nine patients were affected by severe partial epilepsy with bisynchronous EEG and drop attacks, and 16 patients suffered from partial epilepsy without bisynchronous EEG and fall seizures. Forms were designed for prospective data collection on each patient's history, seizures, implants, device settings, quality of life (QOL), neuropsychological assessment and adverse events. Surgical technique was performed both by standard two incisions and single neck incision. ResultsMean reduction in total seizures was 39 % at 3 months, 38 % at 6 months, 49 % at 12 months, 61 % at 24 months and 71 % at 36 months. Significant better results were obtained in partial epilepsy, with and without drop attacks, than in Lennox–Gastaut syndrome—three patients being seizure-free. No operative morbidity was reported. Side-effects were minor and transient—the most common were voice alteration and coughing during stimulation. In two patients, <b>electrode</b> <b>breakage</b> occurred 3 years after surgical procedure; in both cases, a new device was implanted after removing the vagal electrode coils and generator. ConclusionVNS can be considered an appropriate strategy as an add-on treatment in children affected by drug-resistant partial epilepsy and ineligible for resective epilepsy surgery...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is an {{effective}} alternative treatment for patients with refractory epilepsy. Nevertheless, information regarding VNS is still limited. Materials and Methods: In the present non randomized, prospectic study we report our clinical safety and effectiveness of VNS in 100 patients (52 Males and 48 Females) with drug resistant epilepsy. Patient’s age at implant ranged from 0, 64 to 51, 04 years (mean age 15. 3 years). The mean follow-up time was 54, 8 months (range 2 to 108, 3 months). Seventeen patients suffered from Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, 34 patients suffered from partial epilepsy with drop attacks and secondary bysinchronism on the EEG (Lennox Gastaut-like) and 49 patients had Partial Epilepsy without drop attacks. Data collection forms were designed for prospectively gathering data on each patient’s history, seizures, drug therapy, implant device settings and side effects. Patients were assessed prior the implant and 3, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Results: Seventy-eight patients completed the 24 months follow-up session. VNS produced a mean seizure rate reduction of 32 % at 3 months, 41 % at 12 months, and 45 % at 24 months. At 24 months, only the Partial Epilepsy patients showed a seizures reduction of 50 %, which is considered clinically significant. Moreover both the age at implant and epilepsy duration were inversely correlated with the percentage of seizure reduction at 24 months. Side effects were minor and transient; the most common were voice alteration and coughing during stimulation. In 7 patients <b>electrode</b> <b>breakage</b> occurred {{three years after the}} surgical procedure. Conclusion: In our study, clinical effectiveness is higher in younger children implanted before than 12 years with shorter epilepsy duration suggesting a precocious useful role of VNS. Patients with Lennox Gastaut Syndrome show a worse clinical response rather than other epileptic syndromes...|$|E

40|$|Background: Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) of the {{globus pallidus}} internus (GPi) offers a very promising therapy for medically intractable dystonia. However, {{little is known}} about the long-term benefit and safety of this procedure. We therefore performed a retrospective long-term analysis of 18 patients (age 12 - 78 years) suffering from primary generalized (9), segmental (6) or focal (3) dystonia (minimum follow-up: 36 months). Methods: Outcome was assessed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) scores (generalized dystonia) and the Tsui score (focal/segmental dystonia). Follow-up ranged between 37 and 90 months (mean 60 months). Results: Patients with generalized dystonia showed a mean improvement in the BFM movement score of 39. 4 % (range 0 68. 8 %), 42. 5 % (range - 16. 0 to 81. 3 %) and 46. 8 % (range- 2. 7 to 83. 1 %) at the 3 - and 12 -month, and long-term follow-up, respectively. In focal/ segmental dystonia, the mean reduction in the Tsui score was 36. 8 % (range 0 - 100 %), 65. 1 % (range 16. 7 - 100 %) and 59. 8 % (range 16. 7 - 100 %) at the 3 - and 12 -month, and long-term follow-up, respectively. Local infections were noted in 2 patients and hardware problems (<b>electrode</b> dislocation and <b>breakage</b> of the extension cable) in 1 patient. Conclusion: Our data showed Gpi-DBS to offer a very effective and safe therapy for different kinds of primary dystonia, with a significant long-term benefit in the majority of cases.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Applications of {{chromium}} {{vary widely}} (refractories, chemicals and metallurgical); however, the greatest benefit of chromium {{is its ability}} to improve the corrosion resistance, strength and hardness of steel. South Africa possesses approximately 75 % of the viable global chromite reserves and, as a result, dominates the ferrochrome market with production in excess of 5 million mega tonnes per year - making it an industry of extreme importance to the South African economy Submerged arc ferroalloy production furnaces mainly use Soderberg electrodes - self–baking continuous electrodes that are produced in situ during furnace operation. Electrode breakings may affect a furnace {{in a number of ways}} depending on the nature and location of the break. Low furnace power input, abnormal charging and tapping conditions, as well as loss of production are among the more common negative implications associated with electrode breaks. The successful operation of Soderberg electrodes is dependent on two main factors: high quality electrode paste and effective electrode management procedures. This study focused on electrode paste quality. The raw materials utilised in the production of Soderberg electrode paste consists of calcined anthracite mixed with a tar pitch binder. In this study the focus was on the development of an experimental procedure to measure the dimensional changes of electrode paste raw materials as a function of temperature by means of thermomechanical analysis (TMA). Three uncalcined anthracite (Zululand chips, Zululand duff, and Tendele duff) and two tar pitch samples (low and high softening point pitches, i. e. LSP and HSP) were obtained from a local paste producer. Electrode graphite samples were also obtained from a local pre–baked electrode supplier. The experimental procedure for both the anthracite and tar pitches consisted of two phases: sample preparation and TMA measurements. During the sample preparation procedure for the tar pitches, the two tar pitches were heat treated in order to prevent softening in the TMA (preventing possibly damage the instrument), where after pellets were pressed for TMA measurement. The anthracite samples were calcined at 1200, 1300 and 1400 °C in the anthracite sample preparation phase. TMA sample pellets of calcined and uncalcined anthracite were pressed using only water as a binder. TMA was performed on pellets produced from the heat–treated tar pitch samples, uncalcined and calcined anthracite samples, as well as core drilled pellets of the pre–baked electrode graphite. The dimensional changes of these pellets were measured, as a function of temperature, through three consecutive heating (room temperature to 1300 °C) and cooling (1300 °C to approximately 100 °C) cycles under a N 2 atmosphere. A significant shrinkage (> 12 %) for both the LSP and HSP tar pitches occurred during the first TMA heating cycle. During the second and third heating cycles of the LSP and HSP tar pitches, dimensional changes were approximately 2 %. This indicates that substantial structural reordering of the carbonaceous binder takes place during the first heating cycle. TMA results obtained for all three the calcined anthracite samples investigated indicated thermal dimensional changes of less than 1 %. The anthracite samples calcined at the highest experimental calcination temperature (1400 °C) prior to TMA analysis had the smallest dimensional changes. This confirmed that higher calcination temperatures result in a higher level of structural ordering and dimensional stability. Considering the combined calcined anthracite and tar pitches TMA results, the importance of the initial baking of a Soderberg electrode at temperatures exceeding the baking isotherm temperature (475 °C) becomes apparent - the dimensional behaviour of the tar pitch binder and the calcined anthracite differ dramatically, making the newly–formed electrode very susceptible to breakage. Once structural reordering of the pitch had taken place, thermal dimensional behaviours of the materials are much more similar, significantly reducing the risk of thermal shock–induced <b>electrode</b> <b>breakages.</b> In contrast to the relatively small dimensional changes measured for the calcined anthracite samples, the shrinkages measured for the uncalcined samples during the first TMA heating/cooling cycle were substantial (6 – 8 %). This indicates the importance of the anthracite calcination process, before the electrode paste is formulated. Improperly calcined anthracite present in electrode paste would result in additional dimensional shrinkage that would have to be accommodated in the baking of a new electrode section. Considering the large shrinkage of the tar pitch that already takes place, it is unlikely that a strong enough electrode would be formed if this occurs. From the results, it also became apparent that the anthracite with the highest fixed carbon and lowest ash contents exhibited the smallest shrinkage during in situ TMA calcination. High fixed carbon, low ash type anthracites are therefore less prone to dimensional instabilities in Soderberg electrodes, as a result of poor calcination. The dimensional changes observed in the calcined anthracites were very similar to those observed for the electrode graphite samples. The expansions/shrinkages observed in the graphite samples were mostly less than 0. 5 %, whereas the expansions/shrinkages observed in the various calcined anthracites were approximately 0. 6 to 0. 9 %. The difference in the magnitude of the dimensional behaviour between the calcined anthracites and the graphite can be attributed to the fact that the graphite had already undergone maximum structural ordering (having been pre–baked at 3000 °C).
