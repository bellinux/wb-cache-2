5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I <b>feel</b> <b>myself</b> through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
500|$|Pompeo has {{expressed}} {{her lack of}} interest in acting after Grey's Anatomy ends its run. In an September 2011 interview, she said, [...] "I definitely <b>feel</b> <b>myself</b> transitioning. I don't find acting terribly empowering." [...] Since then, Pompeo has been involved in other projects as a producer and had also made her directorial debut with a Grey's Anatomy episode, from the thirteenth season. On August 2014, it was announced that Pompeo was developing two dramas with ABC Studios - adaptation of Rachel Carey’s 2013 novel Debt for ABC Family, and an untitled female police drama for ABC. Pompeo is also involved with a Spanish thriller Motivos Personales with the London-based company, New Media Vision.|$|E
500|$|Eichmann {{was taken}} to a {{fortified}} police station at Yagur in Israel, where he spent nine months. The Israelis were unwilling to take him to trial based solely on the evidence in documents and witness testimony, so the prisoner was subject to daily interrogations, the transcripts of which totalled over 3,500 pages. The interrogator was Chief Inspector Avner Less of the national police. Using documents provided primarily by Yad Vashem and Nazi hunter Tuviah Friedman, Less was often able to determine when Eichmann was lying or being evasive. When additional information was brought forward that forced Eichmann into admitting what he had done, Eichmann would insist he had not had any authority in the Nazi hierarchy and had only been following orders. Inspector Less noted that Eichmann did not seem to realise the enormity of his crimes and showed no remorse. His pardon plea, released in 2016, did not contradict this: [...] "There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments {{in the hands of the}} leaders", Eichmann wrote. [...] "I was not a responsible leader, and as such do not <b>feel</b> <b>myself</b> guilty." ...|$|E

500|$|Initially Albert was {{not popular}} with the British public; he was {{perceived}} to be from an impoverished and undistinguished minor state, barely larger than a small English county. The British Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, advised the Queen against granting her husband the title of [...] "King Consort"; Parliament also objected to Albert being created a peer—partly because of anti-German sentiment {{and a desire to}} exclude Albert from any political role. Albert's religious views provided a small amount of controversy when the marriage was debated in Parliament: although {{as a member of the}} Lutheran Evangelical Church Albert was a Protestant, the non-Episcopal nature of his church was considered worrisome. Of greater concern, however, was that some of Albert's family were Roman Catholic. Melbourne led a minority government and the opposition took advantage of the marriage to weaken his position further. They opposed the ennoblement of Albert and granted him a smaller annuity than previous consorts, £30,000 instead of the usual £50,000. Albert claimed that he had no need of a British peerage, writing: [...] "It would almost be a step downwards, for as a Duke of Saxony, I <b>feel</b> <b>myself</b> much higher than a Duke of York or Kent." [...] For the next seventeen years, Albert was formally titled [...] "HRH Prince Albert" [...] until, on 25 June 1857, Victoria formally granted him the title Prince Consort.|$|E

As {{would be the case}} with many of his films, McGillivray makes cameo appearances in both: in I’m Not <b>Feeling</b> <b>Myself</b> Tonight he is “Man at Party” who pulls Monika Ringwald’s dress off while in The Hot Girls he was given the job of doing an onscreen interview with Danish actress Helli Louise, who according to the synopsis in Cinema X magazine, talks to him about [...] "working on a movie, and telling a few facts of life about screen nudity and enacting lesbian love scenes." ...|$|R

2500|$|In the [...] "painful {{situation}} in which I <b>feel</b> <b>myself</b> placed", Fitzwilliam appealed to Burke's memory. However Milton assured his father that {{all he wanted was}} permission to give reform his general support, to which Fitzwilliam acquiesced. When in summer 1822 Yorkshire reformers wanted a county meeting to push for reform, Milton said of his father: [...] "I do feel very great difficulty upon one which agitates him to a degree which cannot be conceived by those who have not been in the habit of conversing with him upon it. It is indeed the only subject I know which deprives him of his usual calmness".|$|E

2500|$|Groves was {{particularly}} noted for his assured conducting of large-scale works {{and was the}} first conductor to direct a complete cycle of Gustav Mahler's symphonies in Britain. He was also famous for encouraging modern composers, and he frequently included their works in his programmes. [...] Groves conducted a wide repertory, refusing to concentrate on any particular subgenre. [...] He remarked, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>myself</b> a GP [...] rather than a consultant." [...] Nevertheless, he became particularly known as a champion of British composers and invariably offered British works in his programmes when touring abroad.

However, he suspects that Elena is {{not in love with}} Rodrigo (Duet: Le mie barbare vicende / [...] "What good will it do to hear about my cruel fortunes?").

[...] Looking back on the few but crowded years between, it occurred to me forcibly how fortunate I had been in my decision and how lucky not to miss the experiences which had fallen to my lot in the intervening space of time. To me, it was not disagreeable to look forward to a future of uncertainty and insecurity, with none of the slow inevitability of a career in the Government service; to <b>feel</b> <b>myself,</b> in however small a way, the master of my destiny.

2500|$|Theo {{referred}} to these pictorial {{elements in a}} letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: [...] "I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [...] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things." [...] Vincent responded in early November, [...] "Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I <b>feel</b> <b>myself</b> greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it. But am inclined to believe {{that in the long run}} you'd get used to it." [...] And later in the same letter, he wrote, [...] "I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beresford {{and other}} Irish {{supporters}} of Ascendancy were alarmed at Fitzwilliam's policies. Pitt wrote to Fitzwilliam on 9 February that Beresford's removal was never [...] "to my recollection...hinted at {{even in the}} most distant manner...much less...without his consent" [...] and that he should have discussed it at the meeting held on 15 November. Furthermore, Fitzwilliam's policies were [...] "in contradiction to the ideas which I thought were fully understood among us. ... On most of these points I should have written to your lordship sooner but the state of public business has really not left me the time of doing so; and it is not without very deep regret that I <b>feel</b> <b>myself</b> under the necessity of interrupting your attention by considerations of this sort while there are so many others of a different nature which all our minds ought to be directed". On 14 February Fitzwilliam replied that it was support national security that he made those appointments: the disaffection amongst Catholics was great and so a change in direction was needed to retain Ireland. His fears of Beresford's [...] "power and influence" [...] had been [...] "too well founded: I found them incompatible with mine...and after the receipt of this, you will be prepared to decide between Mr Beresford and me and that the matter is come to this issue is well known here". Fitzwilliam asserted that he had already informed Pitt of his intention to remove Beresford and he had [...] "made no objection, nor, indeed, any reply", which he took to mean the decision was at his discretion. If Pitt refused his advise, he should be recalled: [...] "These are not times for the fate of the empire to be trifled with. ... I will deliver over the country in the best state I can to any person, who possesses more of your confidence".|$|E
