5|$|To allow {{passengers}} {{to walk off}} the train without arrival checks in most cases, juxtaposed controls ordinarily {{take place at the}} <b>embarkation</b> station.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s {{plans were}} laid for a deep-water harbour on the {{northern}} shore of Brean Down. It was intended that this harbour would replace Bristol as a port on <b>embarkation</b> for transatlantic crossings and the export of minerals and agricultural produce from the Mendip Hills {{and the rest of}} Somerset.|$|E
50|$|Cruise {{shipping}} is also {{an essential}} industry at the port, with 211,000 passenger <b>embarkations</b> each year from more than 220 cruise ships.|$|R
50|$|In {{passenger}} numbers, the Briskeby Line is {{the smallest}} line of the entire tram network, with 1,500 daily <b>embarkations</b> along the Briskeby stretch according to a 2004 report.|$|R
50|$|The Brigade {{embarked}} to Egypt {{during the}} months of February and March 1915. In Egypt additional training occurred at the Mena Camp. Subsequent <b>embarkations</b> of reinforcements occurred as and when sufficient recruits were gathered and prepared for movement to a war theatre.|$|R
5|$|Portsmouth Harbour was a vital {{military}} <b>embarkation</b> {{point for}} the D-Day landings on 6June 1944. Southwick House, just {{to the north of}} the city, was the headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander, US General Dwight D. Eisenhower. On 15July 1944 an experimental V-1 flying bomb hit Newcomen Road, killing 15 people.|$|E
5|$|The Port of New York and New Jersey {{comprised}} {{the main point}} of <b>embarkation</b> for U.S. troops and supplies sent to Europe during World War I, via the New York Port of <b>Embarkation.</b> The congestion at the port led experts to realize {{the need for a}} port authority to supervise the extremely complex system of bridges, highways, subways, and port facilities in the New York-New Jersey area. The solution was the 1921 creation of the Port Authority {{under the supervision of the}} governors of the two states. By issuing its own bonds, it was financially independent of either state; the bonds were paid off from tolls and fees, not from taxes. It became one of the major agencies of the metropolitan area for large-scale projects.|$|E
5|$|The Sanctuary is {{surrounded}} by an ambulatory, or passage, along which are forty-two bronze caskets containing hand-written, illuminated Books of Remembrance {{with the names of}} every Victorian who enlisted for active service with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) or Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force in World War I or died in camp prior to <b>embarkation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Brigade embarked to Egypt during {{months of}} May and June 1915. In Egypt additional training {{occurred at the}} Heliopolis Camp. Subsequent <b>embarkations</b> of reinforcements occurred as and when sufficient recruits were gathered and prepared for movement to a war theatre.|$|R
25|$|The Chao Praya, {{connecting}} the fortress of Bangkok to the sea, {{was lined with}} numerous forts, and was blocked at its mouth with five to six rows of huge tree trunks, an iron chain and numerous <b>embarkations.</b> Altogether, there were seven batteries, containing 180 cannons.|$|R
50|$|Not {{only were}} {{buildings}} shattered, but the tsunami also severely eroded the villagers ability to sustain themselves. It destroyed twenty-two of the islanders' outrigger canoes and eight boats, leaving only two <b>embarkations</b> in working order, and killed 823 livestock animals, including 239 pigs belonging to 25 families.|$|R
5|$|In October, the 2/48th Battalion paraded {{through the}} streets of Adelaide to Mitcham railway station prior to its <b>embarkation</b> for the Middle East. The battalion's voyage {{overseas}} was postponed until 17 November, when the unit boarded the SS Stratheden. The ship made a stop at Perth, where Derrick was confined on board for going absent without leave to sightsee. He was soon in more trouble, and was charged and fined for punching another soldier who taunted him over this incident.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September 1940, Foskett {{enlisted in}} the Royal Australian Air Force for service during the Second World War. Accepted for flight {{training}} under the Empire Air Training Scheme, he received his initial flight instruction at No.2 Initial Training School, Bradfield Park. Completing this course on 9 November, Foskett was advanced to leading aircraftman and posted to No.2 <b>Embarkation</b> Depot. On 10 December, he embarked from Sydney bound for Africa.|$|E
5|$|Portus Abonae was a Roman port at {{the mouth}} which {{provided}} an <b>embarkation</b> point for journeys across the River Severn to South Wales. In the 18th century there were short lived attempts at creating a port and a whale fishery here. The name Trym appears to have Anglo-Saxon roots. In recent years silting problems, caused by urban development have caused some difficulties, but alleviation works have helped reduce the problem.|$|E
50|$|Beaconsfield High School {{also offers}} strong {{academic}} immersion and regular English programs at all levels, {{as well as}} an alternative program known as <b>Embarkations,</b> which is renowned for its successes with disenfranchised youth, was started in 1992. Augmenting these course offerings are a wide range of special programs covering Visual Arts, Drama, Dance, Music, Physical Education and Computer Technology.|$|R
50|$|In the 17th {{century the}} Rio Comprido valley {{produced}} sugarcane, flowed {{off by a}} warehouse in <b>embarkations</b> which conducted it to the bay. In the 19th century, the sugar farming was replaced by coffee farming. The neighborhood was settled by Englishmen, and was known {{until the beginning of}} the 20th century as Chácara dos Ingleses (Englishmen Small Ranch).|$|R
25|$|Union Pier, in {{the city}} of Charleston, is a cruise ship {{passenger}} terminal which hosts numerous cruise departures annually. In May 2010, the Carnival Fantasy was permanently stationed in Charleston, offering weekly cruises to the Bahamas and Key West, eventually to include Bermuda. With the addition of the weekly Carnival Fantasy sailings, Union Terminal hosted 67 <b>embarkations</b> and ports of call in 2010.|$|R
5|$|The {{division}} {{also participated}} in the Second Army maneuvers in the Tennessee Maneuver Area from 6 February 1944. It finished its training on 27 March 1944, and transferred to Camp Forrest on 24 March 1944. The division staged at Camp Myles Standish on 12 August 1944 before departing Boston Port of <b>Embarkation</b> on 20 August 1944. The 17th Airborne Division arrived in the United Kingdom on 26 August.|$|E
5|$|With the Red House {{batteries}} out of action, Smyth immediately {{pressed on}} with his invasion plans. However, attempts to embark his 3,000 men ended in chaos; with only 1,200 men managing to board because of a shortage of boats and the artillery taking up an unexpected amount of space on board. Amid torrential rain and freezing cold, a council of war headed by Smyth decided to postpone the invasion pending more thorough preparations that would enable the <b>embarkation</b> of whole force.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{a torrent}} of Japanese fire, the Australians broke contact and made for the landing craft, {{bringing}} the wounded out with them. The <b>embarkation</b> took only five minutes, but as the vessels attempted to depart two of them, overloaded with about 60 men on board, ran aground and stuck fast. In an effort to lighten the load, several men volunteered to leave the craft, which enabled one of the vessels to float free. The other, however, remained stuck. Coming under attack from the Japanese, some of whom waded out and attacked {{the men in the}} vessel with grenades, the casualties mounted, with a number of men, including Downs, being either killed or lost overboard and subsequently listed as missing, presumed killed.|$|E
500|$|The company {{spent time}} on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, and then {{travelled}} to Inveraray in Scotland where they underwent specialised training on Loch Fyne, practising night <b>embarkations</b> on landing craft {{to prepare the}} company for evacuation by sea after raiding the radar installation. [...] After this, the unit returned to Wiltshire and began carrying out practice parachute drops with the aircraft and aircrews of 51 Squadron.|$|R
50|$|Passenger traffic {{went from}} 902,000 <b>embarkations</b> in 1965 {{to more than}} 2.3 million in 1990. From its opening in 1957 to today, the airport has served more than 60 million passengers. Regularly {{scheduled}} international departures and arrivals began in 1981; the original destinations were Bratislava, Budapest, and Prague. The airport later expanded to include flights to the Middle East and Western Europe. The international section of Sochi's terminal is small, but it includes a duty-free shop.|$|R
50|$|The Brigade {{embarked}} to Egypt {{during the}} months of October and November 1914. In Egypt additional training occurred at the Maadi Camp. Subsequent <b>embarkations</b> of reinforcements occurred as and when sufficient recruits were gathered and prepared for movement to a war theatre. It served in the Gallipoli and Sinai and Palestine campaigns. The Brigade was disbanded at Kantara, July 1919 when the various regiments within the Brigade embarked for Australia. As each regiment arrived at its specific home port, it was disbanded.|$|R
5|$|Hewitt's {{transfer}} to the Air Force had been made permanent in 1928. He became commanding officer of No. 101 Flight in February 1931, and supervised <b>embarkation</b> of the Seagull aboard the cruiser HMAS Australia in September–October 1932, by which time he had been promoted to squadron leader. Finishing his tour with No.101 Flight the following year, Hewitt was posted to Britain in 1934. He attended RAF Staff College, Andover, {{in his first year}} abroad, and served as Assistant Liaison Officer at Australia House, London, in 1935. Although a specialist seaplane pilot, he converted to bombers while in England, flying Hawker Hinds and Bristol Blenheims as the commanding officer of No.104 Squadron RAF from 1936.|$|E
5|$|On November 31, Smyth tried again, {{ordering}} his men {{to embark}} two hours before dawn {{in order to avoid}} enemy fire. This time, the <b>embarkation</b> was so slow that, two hours after daylight, only 1,500 men were on board. Rather than attempt an amphibious landing in broad daylight, Smyth once again postponed the invasion. By this time, morale in Smyth’s command had plummeted: “all discipline had dissolved; the camp was a bedlam”. This, and widespread illness among the troops, persuaded a second council of war called by Smyth to suspend all offensive operations until the army was reinforced.|$|E
5|$|The Commandos {{were divided}} into three groups: One and Two would travel in the MLs, while Three would be in Campbeltown. Under the command of Captain Hodgeson, Group One had the {{objectives}} of securing the Old Mole and eliminating the anti-aircraft gun positions around the southern quays. They were then {{to move into the}} old town and blow up the power station, bridges and locks for the new entrance into the basin from the Avant port. The capture of the mole was a major objective, as it was to be the <b>embarkation</b> point for the evacuation after the mission.|$|E
50|$|The Siamese then {{endeavored}} to confine the French {{troops in the}} Bangkok fortress, by building redoubts. Twelve small forts were constructed around the French fortress, each one containing between seven and ten cannons. According to the French, this {{was done with the}} help of the Dutch.The Chao Praya, connecting the fortress of Bangkok to the sea, was lined with numerous forts, and was blocked at its mouth with five to six rows of huge tree trunks, an iron chain and numerous <b>embarkations.</b> Altogether, there were seven batteries, containing 180 cannons.|$|R
5000|$|The highly picturesque and {{historically}} useful Anthony Roll was a luxury illuminated manuscript {{inventory of the}} ships of the Royal Navy prepared for Henry VIII in the 1540s. However it is neither very visually accurate nor artistically accomplished, having perhaps been illustrated by the official concerned. [...] As in France, 16th-century English paintings of elaborate royal <b>embarkations</b> and similar occasions are formulaic, if often impressive. Most used Netherlandish artists, as did representations in prints of {{the defeat of the}} Spanish Armada in 1588. The Virgin of the Navigators is a Spanish work of the 1530s with a group of ships at anchor, presumably in the New World, protected by the Virgin.|$|R
5000|$|During August {{the corpses}} of about forty German {{soldiers}} were washed up at scattered {{points along the}} coast between the Isle of Wight and Cornwall. The Germans had been practising <b>embarkations</b> in the barges along the French coast. Some of these barges put out to sea in order to escape British bombing and were sunk, either by bombing or bad weather. This {{was the source of}} a widespread rumour that the Germans had attempted an invasion and had suffered very heavy losses either by drowning or by being burnt in patches of sea covered with flaming oil. We took no steps to contradict such tales, which spread freely through the occupied countries in a wildly exaggerated form and gave much encouragement to the oppressed populations. - Winston Churchill ...|$|R
5|$|The assault {{troops with}} their {{supplies}} and equipment {{had to be}} loaded on board the ships on 31 December 1943, just {{five days after the}} assault on Cape Gloucester. Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey's VII Amphibious Force allotted 6 Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs), 10 High speed transports (APDs) and 17 Landing Craft Infantry (LCIs). A last minute hitch developed on 30 December when it was discovered that only nine APDs would be available. New <b>embarkation</b> tables were drawn up, shifting personnel not required in the assault waves to LCIs, and the landing schedule was revised {{in the light of the}} reduced number of landing craft.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground support}} echelon of the 509th Composite Group moved by rail on April 26, 1945, to its port of <b>embarkation</b> at Seattle, Washington. On May 6 the support {{elements}} sailed on the SS Cape Victory for the Marianas, while group materiel was shipped on the SS Emile Berliner. The Cape Victory made brief port calls at Honolulu and Eniwetok but the passengers were {{not permitted to}} leave the dock area. An advance party of the air echelon, consisting of 29 officers and 61 enlisted men flew by C-54 to North Field on Tinian, between May 15 and May 22.|$|E
5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any <b>embarkation</b> conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E
5000|$|The UK {{fleet of}} F-35B Joint Strike Fighter {{aircraft}} {{will be based}} at RAF Marham from 2018. RAF Marham, will be provided with 300 million pounds by the MOD, for new and enhanced infrastructure. The aircraft will be operated by 617 Squadron of the Royal Air Force (the Dambusters) and 809 Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm, alongside at least another frontline squadron from each service. All four squadrons will have a mix of RAF and Royal Navy personnel, and will deploy [...] "detachments" [...] aboard the Royal Navy's new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers., though {{it is believed that}} inherently, the Royal Navy may undertake the majority of routine <b>embarkations</b> in the new vessels. Additionally, Marham will be the only RAF station with a Royal Navy Met Office.|$|R
50|$|Malecón 2000 is {{the name}} given to boardwalk {{overlooking}} the Guayas River in the Ecuadorian port city of Guayaquil. An urban renewal project focusing on the old Simón Bolívar boardwalk, it stands along the west shore of the river for an approximate length of 2.5 km. (1.5 mi.) Several of the greatest historical monuments {{in the history of}} Guayaquil can be seen along its length, as well as museums, gardens, fountains, shopping malls, restaurants, bars, food courts, the first IMAX theater in South America, as well as boarding docks where several <b>embarkations</b> offer both daytime and nighttime tours up and down the Guayas River.It {{is one of the largest}} works realized in Guayaquil and it is considered a model of urban regeneration by global standards, having been declared a healthy public space by the Pan-American Organization of Health (POH) and the World Health Organization (WHO).|$|R
2500|$|The {{swiftness}} of the <b>embarkations</b> surprised {{all foreign}} observers. Louis {{had in fact}} delayed his threats against the Dutch until early September because he assumed it then would be {{too late in the}} season to set the expedition in motion anyway, if their reaction proved negative; typically such an enterprise would take at least some months. Being ready after the last week of September / first week of October would normally have meant that the Dutch could have profited from the last spell of good weather, as the autumn storms tend to begin in the third week of that month. This year they came early however. For three weeks the invasion fleet was prevented by adverse south-westerly gales from departing from the naval port of Hellevoetsluis and Catholics all over the Netherlands and the British kingdoms held prayer sessions that this [...] "popish wind" [...] might endure. However, on 14/24October it became the famous [...] "Protestant Wind" [...] by turning to the east.|$|R
