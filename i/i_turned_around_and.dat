And then from behind another tree another woman came up and she said, 'Well, my name is Shirley Little Dove, {{and this is my}} sister Devi White Dove, and we are descended from Pocahontas.' And as they stood there, I mean I took a picture of both of them, and between their faces was Pocahontas' face in my mind – I could see her.|$|E
500|$|The parade scene took {{multiple}} days of filming; Broderick {{spent some}} time practicing the dance moves. [...] "I was very scared", Broderick said. [...] "Fortunately, the sequence was carefully choreographed beforehand. We worked out all the moves by rehearsing in a little studio. It was shot on two Saturdays {{in the heart of}} downtown Chicago. The first day was during a real parade, and John got some very long shots. Then radio stations carried announcements inviting people to take part in 'a John Hughes movie'. The word got around fast and 10,000 people showed up! For the final shot, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> saw a river of people. I put my hands {{up at the end of}} the number and heard this huge roar. I can understand how rock stars feel. That kind of reaction feeds you." ...|$|E

He sat next to Cobain on a flight from Los Angeles to Seattle on April 1. McKagan later recalled, [...] "I didn't have any foresight that the guy was going to do what he did. I could tell he was bummed out, and I'd been that way before... I thought I'd ask him to come stay at my house; <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> he was gone." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{an article}} by The Palm Beach Post, Mindy McGillivray stated that in January 2003, when she was 23 years old, she was groped by Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate. She said, [...] "All of a sudden I felt a grab, a little nudge. I think it's friend Ken Davidoff's camera bag, {{that was my first}} instinct. <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> there's Donald. He sort of looked away quickly." [...] Ken Davidoff, a photographer, corroborated McGillivray's account, saying he remembered her pulling him aside moments after the alleged {{incident}} to say [...] "Donald just grabbed my ass!" ...|$|R

2500|$|The album's working {{title was}} Strawberries for Pigs, a name {{inspired}} by the reception the band's newer music received from some of their older fans. As Vanian explained, [...] "we were playing {{a lot of new}} material, and we had an audience that didn't want to hear about anything, they just wanted to hear Neat Neat Neat and New Rose nothing else. And they wanted to just smash everything. And they weren't interested in hearing music at all. So at one point, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> said, 'It's like giving strawberries to a fucking pig, this gig, you know?' And that stuck in our minds, and we used it".|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{stood looking}} at the school— it looked so big! Just then the guards let some white {{students}} through. The crowd was quiet. I guess they were {{waiting to see what}} was going to happen. When I was able to steady my knees, I walked up to the guard who had let the white students in. He didn’t move. When I tried to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet and then the other guards moved in and they raised their bayonets. They glared at me with a mean look and I was very frightened and didn’t know what to do. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer. Somebody started yelling, [...] "Drag her over this tree! Let's take care of that nigger!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Jimmy had {{a little}} bit of trouble with the solo on [...] "Stairway to Heaven"... e hadn't completely figured it out. Nowadays you sometimes spend a whole day doing one thing. Back then, we never did that. We never spent a very long time recording anything. I remember sitting in the control room with Jimmy, he's standing there next to me and he'd done quite a few passes and it wasn't going anywhere. I could see he was getting a bit paranoid and so I was getting paranoid. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> said [...] "You're making me paranoid!" [...] And he said, [...] "No, you're making me paranoid!" [...] It was a silly circle of paranoia. Then bang! On the next take or two he ripped it out.|$|E

I see Mike looking at me as I tell a story that has no {{relevance}} whatsoever and I lose track. [...] Now, the guys have to start playing songs because my on-stage monologues go on so long." ...|$|R
2500|$|Giladi relates that {{he became}} politicized after an {{experience}} at the Socialist/Zionist party headquarters. He had received a letter asking for help with their Arabic newspaper, and {{when he showed up}} at the headquarters and tried to show them the letter, he was dismissively told to report to the [...] "Department for Jews from Islamic Countries" [...] by many people who had not even looked at his letter to see why he had been invited. He says that he [...] "was disgusted and angry. Either I am a member of the party or I'm not. Do I have a different ideology or different politics because I am an Arab Jew? It's segregation, I thought, just like a Negroes' Department. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> walked out. That was the start of my open protests. That same year I organized a demonstration in Ashkelon against Ben-Gurion's racist policies and 10,000 people turned out." ...|$|E

6000|$|There wasn't {{anything}} else in the room to divide, and we were just about to come out and call the thing settled, when I heard a shout at the door. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> there stood Harry Alden, and Scott, and Tom Myers and his brother George! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thanked her}} for her {{information}} and bade her good-bye. She shook my hand very cordially and I walked away. I had gone but a very few steps when <b>I</b> wanted to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> look back, but I did not.|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time Captain Hannock was letting forth {{a flood of}} vile {{language}} at everything and everybody. He {{wanted to know who}} had aided me to escape and he threatened to shoot me if <b>I</b> did not <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> swim back.|$|R
5000|$|The song is in {{the form}} of the singer's words to his departing lover, {{inspired}} by the end of their romance. Stevens later recalled to Mojo: [...] "It was one of those chord sequences that's very common in Spanish music. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> it <b>around</b> <b>and</b> came up with that theme—which is a recurring theme in my work—which is to do with leaving, the sadness of leaving, and the anticipation of what lies beyond." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> {{it was a}} girl. She was {{standing}} there with a gentleman,--her father, I soon found out,--and I don't know how long they had been watching us. She was about thirteen years old, and came over with her father in a sail-boat. I remembered seeing them cruising around as we were sailing over.|$|E
60|$|I HAD {{shut the}} door to. Then <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> there he was. I used to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much. I {{reckoned}} I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken--that is, after the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected; but right away after I see I warn't scared of him worth bothring about.|$|E
60|$|But when <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> {{peered over}} the dark waters, {{it was quite}} plain {{to me that it}} was not want of oil, but {{increased}} distance, which made those lights so dim. I could now perceive but three of them, and as the surface was agitated only by a gentle swell, I could not suppose that any of them were hidden from our view by waves. We were being left behind, that was certain, and all I could do was to row on as long and as well as I could in the direction which the other boats had taken. I had been used to rowing, and thought I pulled a good oar, and I certainly did not expect to be left behind in this way.|$|E
5000|$|... "I've {{played all}} over in 15 years, from Canada to South America, {{and it has}} been an up-and-down journey," [...] Tingley told The L.A. Times. [...] "Hopefully <b>I</b> can <b>turn</b> things <b>around</b> <b>and</b> stay on an upswing for the next five years." ...|$|R
60|$|The more I {{thought about}} it the madder I got, {{so that by the}} time I reached the valley I was furious, and the result of it was that <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> right <b>around</b> <b>and</b> went up that cliff again as fast as I had come down. I saw that Dian had left the ledge and gone within the cave, but I bolted right in after her. She was lying upon her face on the pile of grasses I had {{gathered}} for her bed. When she heard me enter she sprang to her feet like a tigress.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, a {{sharp pain}} and swelling, {{followed}} by internal bleeding led, he says, to his being diagnosed as having leukemia.

60|$|Judge Douglas, {{in reply}} to what I {{have said about}} having upon a {{previous}} occasion made the speech at Ottawa as the one he took an extract from at Charleston, says it only shows that I practiced the deception twice. Now, my friends, are any of you obtuse enough to swallow that? Judge Douglas had said I had made a speech at Charleston that I would not make up north, and <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> answered him by showing I had made that same speech up north,--had made it at Ottawa; made it in his hearing; made it in the Abolition District,--in Lovejoy's District,--in the personal presence of Lovejoy himself,--in the same atmosphere exactly in which I had made my Chicago speech, of which he complains so much.|$|E

5000|$|On March 13, 1991, Mobley {{was interviewed}} by {{investigators}} from the Hall County Sheriff's Department and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Mobley made a voluntary oral confession to Collins's murder and dictated a written confession. He made further statements on March 14 and 15, including the statement: [...] "The guy <b>I</b> was robbing <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> looked at me. I said 'don't look at me, face the wall.' I pointed the gun up in his direction and turned my head away and fired." ...|$|R
5000|$|Herbert Murray, who {{was convicted}} of murder in 1979, said, [...] "When the judge asked me did I have {{anything}} to say, I couldn't say, because tears were coming down and I couldn’t communicate. <b>I</b> couldn't <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> tell the family that they got the wrong man." [...] The judge said he believed the defense’s alibi witnesses; however, the judge was required by law to respect the jury’s decision. After being locked up for 19 years, his parole officer said [...] "Nineteen years is a long time. .... But you’re no closer to the rehabilitative process than when you first walked into prison. The first step in that process is the internalization of guilt. You need to do some serious introspection, Mr. Murray, and come to grips with your behavior." [...] Murray agreed with the parole officer, but maintained his innocence: [...] "I agree! But again, I just didn't do it." ...|$|R
40|$|Language is intriguing. Take {{the comment}} above. Am I repeating myself or emphasising a point? Can <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> it <b>around</b> <b>and</b> say 2 ̆ 7 {{speaking}} for myself impersonally 2 ̆ 7 ? Unwittingly, our language can {{say more than}} we intend. How I speak about myself reflects how [am aware of myself. But, then, {{what is meant by}} one 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 self 2 ̆ 7 ? Is our experience of the self in 2002 the same as someone in 1002 or in 102 CE? These are the sorts of issues triggered by the above four words. This article will explore some of those aspects of the self under three headings: 1. Is self-awareness the same as either self-knowledge or of knowledge about the self? 2. How is awareness of the Other (God) related to awareness of others and of the self? 3. Do these questions and the ensuing discussion have any relevance today...|$|R

But then if we were to retreat and <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> ran back the Americans would try to kill me too because they'd think I'm an enemy in disguise.

She's always saying, 'Let me send you some of Woody's poetry {{and see if you can}} turn it into a song.' I said, 'Didn't someone else do a whole album of that?"... Wilco and Billy Bragg - they made an awfully good record using his poetry. So I thought, 'Well, I don't know, that's already been done.' But she's very persistent and she sent me four or five poems and, I don't know, it took about six minutes to put that together. It just came real quick. We were making the record and I hadn't written the music yet and I was walking out to the rehearsal room, which is right next to my studio, and I didn't even make it to rehearsal room <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> played it and we went in and recorded it.
