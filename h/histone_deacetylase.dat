5|$|Among the {{approaches}} {{aimed at improving}} cell survival {{in the presence of}} mutant huntingtin are correction of transcriptional regulation using <b>histone</b> <b>deacetylase</b> inhibitors, modulating aggregation of huntingtin, improving metabolism and mitochondrial function and restoring function of synapses.|$|E
5|$|Research {{is being}} {{conducted}} on many {{different approaches to}} prevent Huntington's disease or slow its progression. Disease-modifying strategies can be broadly grouped into three categories: reducing {{the level of the}} mutant huntingtin protein (including gene splicing and gene silencing); approaches aimed at improving neuronal survival by reducing the harm caused by the protein to specific cellular pathways and mechanisms (including protein homeostasis and <b>histone</b> <b>deacetylase</b> inhibition); and strategies to replace lost neurons. In addition, novel therapies to improve brain functioning are under development; these seek to produce symptomatic rather than disease-modifying therapies, and include phosphodiesterase inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|It {{also has}} histone deacetylase-inhibiting effects. The {{inhibition}} of <b>histone</b> <b>deacetylase,</b> by promoting more transcriptionally active chromatin structures, likely presents the epigenetic mechanism for regulation {{of many of}} the neuroprotective effects attributed to valproic acid. Intermediate molecules mediating these effects include VEGF, BDNF, and GDNF.|$|E
25|$|Key {{studies using}} such {{strategy}} {{were conducted in}} 2008. Melton et al. studied the effects of <b>histone</b> <b>deacetylase</b> (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid. They found that it increased reprogramming efficiency 100-fold (compared to Yamanaka’s traditional transcription factor method). The researchers proposed that this compound was mimicking the signaling that is usually caused by the transcription factor c-Myc.|$|E
25|$|HMGA2 protein {{specifically}} targets the {{promoter of}} ERCC1, thus reducing expression of this DNA repair gene. ERCC1 protein expression was deficient in 100% of 47 evaluated colon cancers (though {{the extent to}} which HGMA2 was involved is not known). A 2012 study showed that in normal tissues, HGMA1 and HMGA2 genes are targeted (and thus strongly reduced in expression) by miR-15, miR-16, miR-26a, miR-196a2 and Let-7a. However, each of these HMGA-targeting miRNAs are drastically reduced in almost all human pituitary adenomas studied, when compared with the normal pituitary gland. Consistent with the down-regulation of these HMGA-targeting miRNAs, an increase in the HMGA1 and HMGA2-specific mRNAs was observed. Three of these microRNAs (miR-16, miR-196a and Let-7a) have methylated promoters and therefore low expression in colon cancer. For two of these, miR-15 and miR-16, the coding regions are epigenetically silenced in cancer due to <b>histone</b> <b>deacetylase</b> activity. When these microRNAs are expressed at a low level, then HMGA1 and HMGA2 proteins are expressed at a high level. HMGA1 and HMGA2 target (reduce expression of) BRCA1 and ERCC1 DNA repair genes. Thus DNA repair can be reduced, likely contributing to cancer progression.|$|E

Symbiotic butyrate-producing bacteria which are normally present in the intestine are sometimes used as probiotics to help suppress H. pylori infections {{as an adjunct to}} antibiotic therapy. [...] Butyrate itself is an antimicrobial which destroys the cell envelope of H. pylori by inducing regulatory T cell expression (specifically, FOXP3) and synthesis of an antimicrobial peptide called LL-37, which arises through its action as a <b>histone</b> <b>deacetylase</b> inhibitor ...|$|E
500|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of small, usually heritable, {{molecular}} modifications—or [...] "tags"—that bind DNA and modify gene expression levels. Targeting these tags with drugs can kill cancer cells. Early-stage research in NSCLC using drugs aimed at epigenetic modifications shows that blocking more than one of these tags can kill cancer cells with fewer side effects. Studies also show that giving patients these drugs before standard treatment can improve its effectiveness. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate how well these drugs kill lung cancer cells in humans. Several drugs that target epigenetic mechanisms are in development. <b>Histone</b> <b>deacetylase</b> inhibitors in development include valproic acid, vorinostat, belinostat, panobinostat, entinostat, and romidepsin. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in development include decitabine, azacytidine, and hydralazine.|$|E

2500|$|New {{mechanisms}} are being discovered where transcription is repressed, but the activated GR is not interacting with DNA, but rather with another transcription factor directly, thus interfering with it, or with other proteins {{that interfere with}} the function of other transcription factors. [...] This latter mechanism {{appears to be the}} most likely way that activated GR interferes with NF-κB - namely by recruiting <b>histone</b> <b>deacetylase,</b> which deacetylate the DNA in the promoter region leading to closing of the chromatin structure where NF-κB needs to bind.|$|E
2500|$|Rb {{restricts the}} cell's ability to {{replicate}} DNA by preventing its progression from the G1 (first gap phase) to S (synthesis phase) {{phase of the}} cell division cycle. [...] Rb binds and inhibits E2 promoter-binding–protein-dimerization partner (E2F-DP) dimers, which are transcription factors of the E2F family that push the cell into S phase. By keeping E2F-DP inactivated, RB1 maintains the cell in the G1 phase, preventing progression through the cell cycle and acting as a growth suppressor. [...] The Rb-E2F/DP complex also attracts a <b>histone</b> <b>deacetylase</b> (HDAC) protein to the chromatin, reducing transcription of S phase promoting factors, further suppressing DNA synthesis.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{theophylline}} may reverse the clinical observations of steroid insensitivity in patients with COPD and asthmatics who are active smokers (a condition resulting in oxidative stress) via a distinctly separate mechanism. Theophylline in vitro can restore the reduced HDAC (<b>histone</b> <b>deacetylase)</b> activity that is induced by oxidative stress (i.e., in smokers), returning steroid responsiveness toward normal. Furthermore, theophylline {{has been shown}} to directly activate HDAC2. [...] (Corticosteroids switch off the inflammatory response by blocking the expression of inflammatory mediators through deacetylation of histones, an effect mediated via histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2). Once deacetylated, DNA is repackaged so that the promoter regions of inflammatory genes are unavailable for binding of transcription factors such as NF-κB that act to turn on inflammatory activity. [...] It has recently been shown that the oxidative stress associated with cigarette smoke can inhibit the activity of HDAC2, thereby blocking the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, the {{transcriptional}} silencing mechanism underlying DNA methylation {{which is}} brought about through the hypermethylation of CpG-rich islands {{present in the}} promoter region of genes, can cooperate with histone deacetylation to change chromatin structure to a repressed form. [...] Lo and colleagues looked at the effects of DAC and trichostatin A (TSA, selectively inhibits the mammalian <b>histone</b> <b>deacetylase</b> family of enzymes) on cancer cells. [...] In 4 breast cancer cell lines, SFRP1 expression was significantly restored after treatment with DAC alone. [...] TSA, only in combination with DAC, had a slightly enhanced effect on SFRP1 expression in these cell lines. [...] Interestingly, a different breast cancer cell line (SKBR3, showed loss of SFRP1 expression without significant methylation of the SFRP1 promoter. [...] Lo et al. hypothesized {{that this may be}} due to silencing via histone deacetylation. [...] After SKBR3 cells were treated with TSA, SFRP1 expression was restored in a dose- and time-dependent manner. [...] Yet another breast cancer cell line (T47D) required both DAC and TSA to upregulate SFRP1 expression. [...] This indicates that T47D cells are tightly regulated by two layers of epigenetic control (DNA methylation and histion deacetylation) and relieving inhibition by both mechanisms is necessary for reactivation of SFRP1. [...] This study shows that both the epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, are involved in silencing of SFRP1.|$|E

50|$|There are {{at least}} {{eighteen}} histone deacetylases in Arabidopsis (Hollender et al. 2008). Genome-wide association mapping has shown that deacetylation of histones by <b>Histone</b> <b>Deacetylase</b> 2B negatively affects dormancy.
