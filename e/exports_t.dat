40|$|The thymus is {{essential}} for the generation ofmature T cells, but its role in maintaining the recirculating pool of T lymphocytes has not been clearly established. Too few cells leave the thymus to account for the size of the peripheral T cell pool (1), suggesting that extrathymicT cell proliferation at least partially maintains total T cell numbers. The stimulus for this postthymic T cell division is not known. Stutman and colleague (2, 3) have argued that the thymus <b>exports</b> <b>T</b> cell "progenitors " that divide and differentiate in the periphery and account for the major part of the peripheral T cell pool. Alternatively, mature T cells may expand extrathymically, driven predominantly by exogenous antigen (4). The former mechanism might be expected to maintain a diverse but homonymous repertoire, while a purely antigen-driven system would favor a selective and unequal expansion with a relative loss of diversity. To investigate postthymic changes we have taken advantage of the observation that peripheral T cells expand and permanently reconstitute athymic nude rats (5). The congenital absence of the thymus that characterizes nude rats and mice is reflected in the complete lack of certain T-dependent responses in vivo (6, 7). Early deat...|$|E

Prologue The somewhat schematic partition of the last century natural science into separated fields of research, which were essentially identified with mathematics, physics and biology, is nowadays becoming less and less rigid, leading to large areas of overlapping interests. The fundamental reason for the former de facto separation was the enormous amount of accumulated knowledge in each of the three areas, which resulted in an increasing, and at the end unsurmountable, degree of specialization for people working at the front-end of their research field.

40|$|Metamorphosis in {{amphibians}} {{presents a}} unique {{problem for the}} developing immune system. Because tadpoles are free-living, they need an immune system to protect against potential pathogens. However, at metamorphosis, they acquire {{a variety of new}} adultspecific molecules to which the tadpole immune system must become tolerant. We hypothesized that Xenopus laevis tadpoles may avoid potentially destructive antiself responses by largely discarding the larval immune system at metamorphosis and acquiring a new one. By implanting triploid (3 N) thymuses into diploid (2 N) hosts, we examined the influx and expansion of host T-cell precursors in the donor thymus of normally metamorphosing and metamorphosis-inhibited frogs. We observed that donor thymocytes are replaced by host-derived cells during metamorphosis, but inhibition of metamorphosis does not prevent this exchange of cells. The implanted thymuses <b>export</b> <b>T</b> cells to the spleen. This donor-derived pool of cells declines after metamorphosis in normally developing frogs but is retained to a greater extent if metamorphosis is inhibited. These studies confirm previous observations of a metamorphosis-associated wave of expansion of T cells and demonstrate that it is not dependent on the relatively high concentrations of thyroid hormones required for metamorphosis. Although some larval T cells persist through metamorphosis, others may be destroyed or the larval population is significantly diluted by the expanding adult population...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND & AIMS: Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) {{syndrome}} is the best-characterized {{form of a}} rare entity called autoimmune enteropathy (AIE). IPEX {{syndrome is}} due to mutations in the FOXP 3 gene, a transcription factor essential for the development and function of the natural regulatory CD 25 (+) CD 4 (+) T cells. We studied a female patient with a polyautoimmune AIE syndrome resembling a mild form of IPEX syndrome but associated with recurrent bacterial infections and mild hypogammaglobulinemia. We hypothesized that this syndrome combined a deficit of FOXP 3 (+) cells and other lymphocyte populations. METHODS: We analyzed the major lymphocyte subsets and the FOXP 3 (+) regulatory system in blood samples obtained during the 2 -year period that followed the last autoimmune manifestation. RESULTS: The patient had severe na? T lymphopenia and a major deficit of FOXP 3 (+) CD 4 (+) T cells, both in circulation and in the highly inflamed intestinal mucosa, but mutations in the FOXP 3 locus were excluded. The blood FOXP 3 (+) pool was devoid of CD 25 (high) cells, but the few regulatory CD 25 (+) cells were functional. Intrinsic defects in the expression of CD 25, FOXP 3, and interleukin 2 were excluded. Upon activation, a small subset of cells, presumably committed to regulatory function, sustained expression of CD 25 and FOXP 3. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral T lymphopenia of both na? and natural regulatory T cells might be the consequence of defective thymic production or the short life span of <b>exported</b> <b>T</b> cells.

The M. bovis BCG DNA inserts from ten PhoA+ clones were partially sequenced and used to search databases for similarities to known genes. These revealed similarities to a family of genes coding for high temperature-requirement serine proteases and a Mycobacterium leprae putative exported lipoprotein gene (pel). The DNA inserts from PhoA+ clones were used to probe an M. bovis cosmid library expressed in M. smegmatis 10 identify cosmids containing the full-length genes coding for these exported proteins. Culture filtrates (CFs) prepared from selected M. smegmatis recombinants (cosmids) were assayed {{for their ability to}} induce proliferation and IFN-γ-production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) taken from M. bovis BCG-immunised and non-immunised control cattle. Culture filtrates from two recombinant M. smegmatis (cosmids 44 and 56) induced significant IFN-γ-production and proliferation by PBMCs from immunised animals. An exported protein gene, identified using the phoA-fusion technology, was subcloned from cosmid 56 and its sequence determined and analysed. Database searches using the deduced amino acid sequence of this gene revealed similarities to an M. leprae putative exported lipoprotein (Pel) and a family of MalE maltose-binding proteins. The M. bovis pel gene was shown to be expressed by recombinant M. smegmatis. Preliminary evidence from this study indicates that the M. bovis Pel protein is recognised by antigen-specific lymphocytes from M. bovis BCG-immunised animals. The PBMCs taken from M. bovis challenged and M. bovis BCG vaccinated / challenged cattle also recognised CF from recombinant M. smegmatis expressing the pel gene in in vitro immunoassays.

Here, we quantified recently <b>exported</b> thymic <b>T</b> cells using the approach of measuring episomal DNA fragments [T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) ], generated by T-cell receptor gene rearrangement. Compared to values in healthy individuals (n = 10) or in patients with late-onset MG (n = 8), TREC levels were significantly raised in both the CD 4 + and CD 8 + peripheral blood compartments of patients with thymoma and MG (n = 14, p = 0. 002 and p = 0. 0004 compared to healthy controls) but only in the CD 8 + compartment of the three patients with thymoma without MG (p = 0. 4 and p = 0. 01 for CD 4 + and CD 8 +).
