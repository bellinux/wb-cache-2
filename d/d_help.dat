The data set, which is publicly available on the Governor’s Office of Student Achievement website and Georgia Department of Education (GADOE) website, includes 87 start-up charter schools and 265 charter system schools in operation during the school year 2013 - 14 as reported by the GADOE Office of District Flexibility and Governmental Affairs. Informed by the legislative intent for the Georgia charter school law, the review of the literature conducted for this study examined innovations and increased autonomy in charter schools followed by the student achievement studies involving charter schools across the nation. The method of Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed to analyze the data, following the selection of the sample through propensity score matching procedure. The Factorial ANOVA procedure revealed no significant differences between the mean scores for charter system schools and start-up charter schools as far as the achievement, progress, and achievement gap components of the 2014 CCRPI are concerned. This result led to the conclusion that start-up charter schools and charter system schools fulfill their legislative obligation of increasing student achievement to a similar extent. This study contributes to the policy and political dialog surrounding charter schools. Results from the analysis will: (a) reveal which type of charter school fulfills statutory obligations of increasing student achievement more effectively, (b) inform legislators in adopting new laws or revising current laws regarding school choice options, (c) help leaders of charter systems decide whether to introduce or expand start-up charter school offerings in their district portfolios, and (<b>d)</b> <b>help</b> parents choose the best school option among those available...|$|E

His-stories: Young, non-residential, African American fathers {{participating}} in a responsible fatherhood program: A hermeneutic inquiry. Major Professors: Robert H. Bosselman and Steve B. Garasky. In America, 26 percent of all children live within a single parent household that is headed by a female. Of that number, two-thirds of African American children are now born into single-mother households. The purpose of this Phenomenological (Hermeneutic) study was to conduct in-depth hermeneutical interviews with a selected group of young African American fathers, who have or are currently {{participating in}} one of two Responsible Fatherhood Programs within the western New York area. They were: 1. *Great Starts (Only For Fathers Program) and, 2. *Positive, Outcomes, for Parents, who are Self-Sufficient, or P. O. P. S [...] The P. O. P.

40|$|Background: Urethrovaginal fistula is {{a dreadful}} com-plication of obstetric trauma due to {{prolonged}} labour or obstetric intervention commonly seen in developing coun-tries. Due to prolonged ischaemic changes, the fistula is resistant to healing. The strategic {{location of the}} fistula leads to postoperative impairment of continence mecha-nism. Anatomical repair was previously the commonest mode of surgical management, but {{was associated with a}} miserable cumulative cure rate ranging from 16 - 60 %. Hence we tried to study the efficacy of Martius procedure in the management of urethrovaginal fistula. Material and Methods: We studied the outcome of 12 urethrovaginal fistulae, all caused by obstetric trauma, treated surgically with Martius procedure in 8 and with anatomical repair in 4, retrospectively. 9 patients had re-current fistulae while I patient had multiple fistulae. Pa-tients were followed up for the period ranging from 6 months to 4 ′/ 2 years for fistula healing, continence and postoperative complications like dvspareunia. Results: Cumulative cure rate ofMartius procedure was 87. 5 % with no postoperative stress incontinence, while fistula healing rate of anatomical repair was only 25 % (I patient out of 4) which was also complicated by Intrin-sic Sphincter Deficiency (ISD). In case of recurrent fistu-lae the success rate of anatomical repair was 0 % compared to 83. 33 % with Martius procedure. Conclusions: Martius procedure has shown much bet-ter overall cure rate compared to anatomical repair be-cause - a) it provides better reinforcement to urethral suture line, b) it provides better blood supply and lymph drainage to the ischaemic fistulous area, c) provides sur-face for epithelialization and, <b>d)</b> <b>helps</b> to maintain conti-nence.

There are limited scientific publications on the subject and hence limited empirical evidence exists as to the efficacy of EM. In addition, limited empirical evidence exists as to under what conditions EM can be optimally employed. This study investigated EM by (a) undertaking an extensive literature research on the subject, (b) analysing the following physical and chemical parameters of raw water from different points of Zoo Lake in Johannesburg that had been regularly dosed with EM: pH, conductivity, turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), ammonia, phosphates and heavy metals and (c) laboratory experiments under aerobic and anoxic conditions, analysing the same physical and chemical parameters (as done for the lake) of polluted municipal wastewater that had been dosed with EM. The results from the study showed a significant decrease in turbidity (for the aerobic and anoxic experiments), ammonia and phosphates (for the aerobic experiment). The decrease in turbidity and phosphates was attributed to the EM but not that of ammonia as the control also decreased in the same manner. As such, the levels of treatment achieved by EM on surface and wastewaters were considered to be low as only two (turbidity and phosphates) out of seven parameters measured showed significant decreases. Based on this research, it is anticipated that better treatment efficiencies may be realised by combining EM with other complementary microbiological treatment agents and this is suggested for future research...|$|R

40|$|Recently we {{find two}} main {{issues in the}} current debate on globalized localities: the first issue {{concerns}} itself with the fragmentation and relocation of value chains, chain governance and upgrading, focussing on supply chains between different companies. The second is about the division of labour and knowledge inside of transnational companies. The first perspective has developed new theoretical concepts, inspired by Gereffi, and now already more differentiated {{with regard to the}} question what "upgrading 2 ̆ 01 d of periphal companies can mean. The publication of Schmitz (ed., 2004) offers a view {{on the state of the}} art, which is related to conceptual work and case studies about market relations (arm's length relations), networks (reciprocal dependencies) and quasi-hierarchies (control in supply chains). Hierarchical relations (between parent companies and their subsidaries) are not included. This may be a result of the starting point of the value chain discussion, but obviously there is a research gap. The upgrading perspective is interesting for enterprise geography, because it gives a chance to develop a deeper understanding of 'local knowledge'. Often, we focus on R&D, but for local development, R&D is only one aspect of many. Furthermore, the international division of R&D only offers a technological, incremental view on the distribution of knowledge, but it excludes the perspective on power and governance. Moreover, a set of other aspects can be derived from the value chain debate, i. e. a differentiated understanding of the various kinds of product and process upgrading, functional and intersectoral upgrading. From the contributions in Schmitz (2004), we can learn to what extent and under which circumstances such upgrading really brings a better position for the locality or the region 2 ̆ 013 and under which conditions not (i. e. cases of "running to keep the position 2 ̆ 01 d in the global competition). This paper tries to rule out the conceptual approach of upgrading on the background of the value chain approach, including insights of further research of enterprise geography. Enterprise geography can offer interesting insights for further conceptual work especially on "upgrading 2 ̆ 01 d and thus can give inputs for the interdisciplinary value chain debate. On the background of a case study of the European automobile industry, the paper discusses "upgrading 2 ̆ 01 d in a transnational company. With a closer view on Volkswagen, we will see that the concept of "upgrading 2 ̆ 01 <b>d</b> <b>helps</b> to understand the division of competences in a transnational company in a better way und thus offers new insights into the topic of hierarchies between plants and regions...|$|R
40|$|Accounts {{from over}} 90 {{survivors}} and 56 witnesses of the 2005 London bombings were analysed {{to determine the}} relative prevalence of mass behaviors associated with either psychosocial vulnerability (e. g. `selfishness, mass panic) or collective resilience (e. g. help, unity). `Selfish behaviors {{were found to be}} rare; mutual helping was more common. There is evidence for (a) a perceived continued danger of death after the explosions; (b) a sense of unity amongst at least some survivors, arising from this perceived danger; (c) a link between this sense of unity and helping; and (<b>d)</b> risk-taking to <b>help</b> strangers. We suggest a novel explanation for this evidence of `collective resilience, based on self-categorization theory, according to which common fate entails a redefinition of self (from `me to `us) and hence enhanced concern for others in the crowd...|$|R

It was con-cluded that the majority of environmental releases (water and sludges) are subject to some form of monitoring, in conjunc-tion with an operating permit. Accord-ingly, monitoring data are usually avail-able, to support completion of Form R. The principal exception to this generali-zation concerns air emissions [...] particu-larly fugitive emissions.

30|$|PageRank (Page et al. 1999) is an {{algorithm}} for ranking {{pages in}} web searches {{and was the}} first used by Google. It is an important example of applied computer science, where two good intuitions are combined in a mathematically rigorous way to produce an algorithm of high utility. The first intuition is that the importance of a page is proportional to the number of pages that link to it. Ultimately, the sum of the importance for all pages is one. The second, and more mathematically interesting {{is that there is a}} damping factor which is denoted d. The idea is that a person will only wander so far (click) from a search result before getting bored and moving on to something else. In practice, d ≈ 0.85 (Brin and Page 1998), and this 0 < <b>d</b> < 1 <b>helps</b> to give rapid convergence.|$|R
