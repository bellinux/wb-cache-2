A further commission chaired by General Trần Văn Đôn prior to February 1964 concluded that the tear gas was left behind by French colonial forces in the 1950s.

United States Army chemists in Maryland confirmed that the tear gas had come from canisters dating back to French World War I stocks.

50|$|White Cross (Weisskreuz) is a World War I {{chemical}} warfare agent consisting {{of one or}} more lachrymatory agents: bromoacetone (BA), bromobenzyl cyanide (Camite), bromomethyl ethyl ketone (homomartonite, Bn-stoff), chloroacetone (Tonite, A-stoff), <b>ethyl</b> <b>bromoacetate,</b> and/or xylyl bromide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethyl</b> <b>bromoacetate</b> is the {{chemical}} compound with the formula CH2BrCO2C2H5. It is the ethyl ester of bromoacetic acid and is prepared in two steps from acetic acid. It is a lachrymator {{and has a}} fruity, pungent odor. It is also a highly toxic alkylating agent and may be fatal if inhaled.|$|E
50|$|World War I saw the {{earliest}} {{implementation of this}} technique. The actual first chemical ammunition was the French 26 mm cartouche suffocante rifle grenade, fired from a flare carbine. It contained 35g of the tear-producer <b>ethyl</b> <b>bromoacetate,</b> and was used in autumn 1914 - with {{little effect on the}} Germans.|$|E
50|$|Aminooxyacetic acid {{was first}} {{described}} by Werner in 1893, and was {{prepared by the}} hydrolysis of ethylbenzhydroximinoacetic acid. In 1936, Anchel and Shoenheimer used aminooxyacetic acid to isolate ketones from natural sources. Also in 1936, Kitagawa and Takani described the preparation of aminooxyacetic acid by the condensation of benzhydroxamic acid and <b>ethyl</b> <b>bromoacetate,</b> followed by hydrolysis by hydrochloric acid.|$|E

50|$|The French {{were the}} first to use {{chemical}} weapons during the First World War, using the tear gases <b>ethyl</b> <b>bromoacetate</b> and chloroacetone.

5000|$|Xylyl bromide is an {{irritant}} and lachrymatory agent. It {{has been}} incorporated in chemical weapons {{since the early}} months of World War I. Some commentators say the first use was in August 1914, when the French attacked German soldiers with tear gas grenades, but the agent used in that incident was more likely to be <b>ethyl</b> <b>bromoacetate,</b> which the French had tested before the war.|$|E
50|$|Condensation of 1-indanone (1) with <b>ethyl</b> <b>bromoacetate</b> {{and zinc}} affords Reformatsky {{reaction}} product 2; then reduction with LiAlH4 gives diol 3. Dehydration with H2SO4 gives the indene ethanol 4. Acid catalyzed condensation of 4 with ethyl acetoacetate then gives the fused tetrahydropyran derivative 5 (no doubt by a scheme quite analogous to prodolic acid). The ester is then saponified to the corresponding acid, {{which is then}} converted to the dimethylamide (6). Reduction with LiAlH4 completes the synthesis of the antidepressant agent pirandamine (7).|$|E
50|$|In World War I, <b>ethyl</b> <b>bromoacetate</b> {{was used}} as a lachrymatory agent and tear gas agent for {{chemical}} warfare under the German code Weisskreuz (White Cross), and later as odorant or warning agent in odorless, toxic gases. It is listed by the World Health Organization as a riot control agent, and was first employed for that purpose by French police in 1912. The French may have employed gas grenades of this substance in 1914 during World War I. The German army then used this attack to justify their subsequent employment of chemical weapons in 1915.|$|E

50|$|The {{synthesis}} starts using a Wittig {{reaction of}} pyrene carboxaldehyde. To obtain the ylide needed, firstly triphenyl phosphine is reacted with <b>ethyl</b> <b>bromoacetate</b> {{to form a}} phosphonium salt; after treatment of this salt with a mild base, the ylide can be reacted with the aldehyde in toluene. After hydrogenation of the alpha,beta unsaturated carbonyl compound using hydrogen and palladium in ethyl acetate the ester was converted into the acid chloride using potassium hydroxide, acid and then thionyl chloride. By means of a Friedel-Crafts reaction using aluminium chloride in dichloromethane a ketone was formed. On reduction of this ketone using lithium aluminium hydride the alcohol 3,4-dihydro-5H-benzocdpyren-5-ol was obtained, the 3,4-dihydro-5H-benzocdpyren-5-ol was treated with an acid {{in the form of}} ion exchange resin to furnish the product.|$|E

5000|$|The {{preparation}} of quinolones bearing a substituent at position 5 {{is complicated by}} the greater electrophilic character of the 8 position. One scheme for resolving the problem consists in blocking access to position 8 by first adding a readily removable group to that center.The scheme starts with the conversion of the carboxylic acid in (1) to its dimethyloxazoline derivative (3) by reaction with the dimethyl ethanolamine (2). Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) then removes a proton from the 8 position; treatment of that anion with trimethylsilyl iodide leads to the silylated intermediate (4). A second round of LDA then generates a carbanion at the only open position; reaction with methyl iodide leads to the corresponding 5 methyl derivative (5). Treatment of that product with cesium fluoride breaks the carbon-silicon bond, removing the silyl group; aqueous acid then hydrolyzes the oxazoline to afford the free acid (6). This last intermediate is then taken on to the quinolone (9) [...] by essentially the same scheme as that used to prepare difloxacin, with the difference that the chain elongation is by means of Grignard reagent of <b>Ethyl</b> <b>bromoacetate.</b> Treatment of (9) with 2-methylpiperazine proceeds by reaction at the less hindered of the two amino groups; saponification then affords grepafloxacin (10).|$|E
50|$|Since characterization, the {{development}} of synthetic pathways to histrionicotoxin has been of interest to research groups due to its unusual functionality. The Kishi group proposed the first total synthesis of the parent 283A in 1985 using 89, a previously synthesized lactam used for the synthesis of other variants. Treatment with acetic anhydride yielded 133 in quantitative yield. The cyclic enol ether 134 was formed through oxidative cleavage promoting intramolecular addition followed by a basic deprotection and dehydration. Bromination followed by dehydrobromination in methanol was then found to give an epimeric mixture of unsaturated 135. Hydrolysis, reduction and acetylation yielded 136. Formation of a thiolactam followed by condensation with <b>ethyl</b> <b>bromoacetate</b> gave 137. Selective deprotection of the allylic alcohol followed by oxidation gave 138. A Wittig reaction then generated a chloroalkene, which, upon base-promoted elimination of HCl, gave a terminal alkyne, which was subsequently protected to form 139. The olefinic function of 139 was first reduced using cyanoborohydride before further reduction of 140 to an epimeric mixture of alcohols. A retro-Michael addition was then performed under basic conditions at low temperature, successfully epimerising this compound to give the desired epimer 141. A reaction with triphenylphosphine then generated the phosphonium salt 142, and a Wittig reaction could then be performed to attach the silyl-protected cis-ene-yne function, which was then deprotected to yield the target (±)-HTX 283A.|$|E
