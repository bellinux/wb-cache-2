50|$|Writers Bénédicte Kermadec and Alphonse Boudard {{worked with}} Deray on Roger Borniche's memoir {{in order to}} create the script. The film was {{produced}} by Delon, featuring cinematography by Jean-Jacques Tarbès and an original score by Claude Bolling. The film was shot and printed on 35 mm negative using spherical <b>cinematographic</b> <b>processes,</b> as was common with films produced through the 1950s to the early 1990s. Production began on February 3, 1975, 18 years after Boisson's execution, and the film was shot on locations in both France and Italy.|$|R
25|$|The film {{is notable}} for its avant-garde style, shot on stark high-contrast {{black-and-white}} film, using the spherical <b>cinematographic</b> <b>process</b> with allusions to French New Wave cinema. The striking black-and-white photography of the film's cinematographer, Stephen H. Burum, lies in two main sources: the films of Orson Welles and German cinema of the 1920s. When {{the film was}} in its pre-production phase, Coppola asked Burum how he wanted to film it and they agreed {{that it might be}} the only chance they were ever {{going to have to make}} a black-and-white film.|$|R
25|$|Coppola {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} {{for the film}} with Hinton on his days off from shooting The Outsiders. He made the films back-to-back, retaining {{much of the same}} cast and crew. The film is notable for its avant-garde style with a film noir feel, shot on stark high-contrast black-and-white film, using the spherical <b>cinematographic</b> <b>process</b> with allusions to French New Wave cinema and German Expressionism. Rumble Fish features an experimental score by Stewart Copeland, drummer of the musical group The Police, who used a Musync, a new device at the time.|$|R

5000|$|Los muertos no hablan (The Dead Do Not Speak) is a 1958 Mexican western film {{directed}} by Jaime Salvador, starring Antonio Aguilar as Mauricio Rosales, and Flor Silvestre as Alondra, the femme fatale. The film follows another adventure {{of the rural}} policeman in a town notoriously known for its band of criminals led by [...] "Alma Negra". It is the seventh installment of the Mauricio Rosales [...] "El Rayo" [...] film series, and the last subsequently until the 1980 film Sabor a sangre. It was filmed in Mexiscope, a rare <b>cinematographic</b> <b>process</b> specially used in productions of Rodolfo Rosas Priego.|$|R
5000|$|... 8½ {{was filmed}} in the spherical <b>cinematographic</b> <b>process,</b> using 35-millimeter film, and {{exhibited}} with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1. As with most Italian films of this period, {{the sound was}} entirely dubbed in afterwards; following a technique dear to Fellini, many lines of the dialogue were written only during post production, while the actors on the set mouthed random lines. Otto e mezzo {{marks the first time}} that actress Claudia Cardinale was allowed to dub her own dialogue; previously her voice was thought to be too throaty and, coupled with her Tunisian accent, was considered undesirable.|$|R
50|$|Cy Endfield was {{inspired}} to make the film after reading {{an article on the}} Battle of Rorke's Drift by John Prebble. He took it to actor Stanley Baker with whom he had made several films and who was interested in moving into production. Endfield and Prebble drafted a script, which Baker then showed to Joseph E. Levine while making Sodom and Gomorrah (1962) in Italy. Levine agreed to fund the movie, which was produced by Baker's company, Diamond Films. It was shot using the Super Technirama 70 <b>cinematographic</b> <b>process,</b> and distributed by Paramount Pictures in all countries excluding the United States, where it was distributed by Embassy Pictures.|$|R
5000|$|A common {{compromise}} is to shoot or create material at an aspect ratio of 14:9, and {{to lose some}} image at each side for 4:3 presentation, and some image at top and bottom for 16:9 presentation. In recent years, the <b>cinematographic</b> <b>process</b> known as Super 35 (championed by James Cameron) {{has been used to}} film a number of major movies such as Titanic, Legally Blonde, Austin Powers, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This process results in a camera-negative which can then be used to create both wide-screen theatrical prints, and standard [...] "full screen" [...] releases for television/VHS/DVD which avoid the need for either [...] "letterboxing" [...] or the severe loss of information caused by conventional [...] "pan-and-scan" [...] cropping.|$|R
40|$|Just at a {{time when}} Spanish cinema is getting closer to Hollywood than ever – this year’s Goya winners Celda 211 and Agora {{illustrate}} how a Hollywood blockbuster can be made in Europe – revisiting the cinema of J. A. Bardem would certainly remind us that the practise of imitating Hollywood –whether in terms of genre and narrative conventions, the use of specific technical devices and tricks, or even the importance given to the star-system – is not only unique to post-modern European narratives. In the 1950 s, Bardem’ s early films were directly influenced by narratives and themes found in previous European (Neo-) realist films, and impregnated with a clear flare for Hollywood’s spectacular generic conventions and technicalities. The ‘organised’ hotchpotch derived from that practise resulted in a cinema of difficult classification. It is perhaps that spectacularisation of the storytelling via the different elements of the mise-en-scéne what best defines Hollywood cinema, in contrast with the sincerity, proximity, and ‘anti-artificiality’ sought in European storytelling and filmmaking. However, when these two modes blend, we are faced with an inter-cultural hybrid cinema which hardly belongs to neither of the cinemas that created it. Esa Pareja Feliz/That Happy couple (1951), Muerte de un ciclista/Death of a cyclist (1955), Calle Mayor/Main Street (1956), La venganza/Revenge (1957) are perfect examples of a cinema that harmonised elements inherent to opposed national cinemas such as Spanish, Italian, French and American. This paper will examine the process of hybridisation and the elements that take part in it {{in order to make a}} new Spanish cinema that seemed everything but Spanish: a mode of representing reality with a finger in Hollywood and another in European <b>cinematographic</b> experiences. This <b>process</b> of hybridisation leads us to concepts of pastiche, adaptation, alien influences, cross-cultural dialogues, appropriation of style, and identity...|$|R
