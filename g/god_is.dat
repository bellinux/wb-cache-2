5|$|Bahá'í teachings {{state that}} <b>God</b> <b>is</b> too great {{for humans to}} fully comprehend, or to create a {{complete}} and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of <b>God</b> <b>is</b> achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations. In the Bahá'í religion, <b>God</b> <b>is</b> often referred to by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), {{and there is a}} substantial emphasis on monotheism; such doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising, if not contradicting, the Bahá'í view that <b>God</b> <b>is</b> single and has no equal. The Bahá'í teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path. According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as prayer, reflection, and being of service to others.|$|E

5000|$|Hellenic Christians {{and their}} medieval successors then applied this Form-based {{philosophy}} to the Christian God. Philosophers {{took all the}} things that they considered good, Power, Love, Knowledge and Size, and posited that <b>God</b> <b>was</b> [...] "infinite" [...] in all these respects. They then concluded that <b>God</b> <b>was</b> omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent and omnibenevolent. Since <b>God</b> <b>was</b> perfect, any change would make him less than perfect, so they asserted that <b>God</b> <b>was</b> unchanging, or immutable.|$|R

5|$|Gregory {{was one of}} {{the first}} theologians to argue, in {{opposition}} to Origen, that <b>God</b> <b>is</b> infinite. His main argument for the infinity of God, which can be found in Against Eunomius, is that God's goodness is limitless, and as God's goodness is essential, <b>God</b> <b>is</b> also limitless.|$|E
5|$|In God, Power and Evil: A Process Theodicy, {{published}} in 1976, David Ray Griffin criticised Augustine's reliance on free will {{and argued that}} it is incompatible with divine omniscience and omnipotence. Griffin argued in later works that humans cannot have free will if <b>God</b> <b>is</b> omniscient. He contented that, if <b>God</b> <b>is</b> truly omniscient, then he will know infallibly what people will do, meaning that they cannot be free. Griffin argued that the human will could not oppose God's will, if <b>God</b> <b>is</b> omnipotent. He proposed that original sin as Augustine conceived it must itself be caused by God, rendering any punishment he wills unjust.|$|E

5|$|John Calvin, a sixteenth-century French theologian and {{principal}} {{figure in the}} development of Calvinism, was influenced by Augustine's works. Unlike Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept that <b>God</b> <b>is</b> responsible for evil and suffering; however, he maintained that God cannot be indicted for it. Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin {{is the result of the}} fall of man, and argued that the human mind, will, and affections are corrupted by sin. He believed that only the grace of <b>God</b> <b>is</b> sufficient to provide humans with ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is blinded by humans' sinful nature. Calvin proposed that humanity is predestined, divided into the elect and the reprobate: the elect are those who God has chosen to save and are the only ones who will be saved.|$|E
60|$|But in all {{the books}} he had there was no picture of God, though he found much to confirm his belief that <b>God</b> <b>was</b> a great, an all-powerful individual. He saw {{pictures}} of places where <b>God</b> <b>was</b> worshiped; but never any sign of God. Finally he {{began to wonder if}} <b>God</b> <b>were</b> not of a different form than he, and at last he determined to set out in search of Him.|$|R

6000|$|... 4. Early civilisations. Monarchic or aristocratic. (Greece, Egypt, India, Peru, Mexico.) Polytheism. One <b>god</b> {{tends to}} <b>be</b> supreme. Religiously regarded, <b>gods</b> <b>are</b> moral; in myth <b>are</b> the reverse. <b>Gods</b> <b>are</b> in receipt of sacrifice. Heavenly society is {{modelled}} on that of men, monarchic or aristocratic. Philosophic thought tends towards belief in one pure <b>god,</b> who may <b>be</b> named Zeus, in Greece.|$|R
5|$|Thomas Aquinas {{argued that}} {{statements}} about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has {{more than one}} potential meaning) because an analogy {{is in some ways}} the same and in some ways different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when <b>God</b> <b>is</b> described as good, {{it does not mean that}} <b>God</b> <b>is</b> good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century {{scholastic}} {{philosopher and}} theologian {{heavily influenced by}} Augustine, proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his Summa Theologica. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God, through his Five Ways, and then attested that <b>God</b> <b>is</b> good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist. Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded that <b>God</b> <b>is</b> goodness, {{and that there is}} no evil in God.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} theme in these myths is {{the effort of}} the gods to maintain maat {{against the forces of}} disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris' murder, in which that <b>god</b> <b>is</b> resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun <b>god</b> <b>is</b> also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of Nun, the primordial chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial chaos.|$|E

5|$|All {{variations}} of the argument from morality begin with an observation about moral thought or experiences and conclude with the existence of God. Some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim evident through human experience, arguing that <b>God</b> <b>is</b> the best explanation for these. Other versions describe some end which humans should strive to attain, only possible if God exists.|$|E
5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{represents}} {{the synthesis of}} masculine and feminine energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of <b>God,</b> <b>is</b> inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God. The union of these principles is exalted as the root and womb of all creation. Another view is that Ardhanarishvara {{is a symbol of}} Shiva's all-pervasive nature.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{seemed to}} have {{influenced}} him with certain moral principles, though Gandhi himself had been influenced by The Kingdom of <b>God</b> <b>Is</b> Within You, a nonviolent classic written by Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy. In turn, both Gandhi and Martin Luther King had read Tolstoy, and King, Gandhi and Tolstoy had been strongly influenced by Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. King quoted Tolstoy's War and Peace in 1959.|$|E

5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of <b>God,</b> <b>is</b> still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of <b>God</b> <b>is</b> complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E
