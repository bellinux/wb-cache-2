50|$|The CDM is a <b>flexible</b> <b>mechanism</b> set {{up under}} the Kyoto Protocol {{with the aim of}} {{creating}} ‘Carbon Credits’ for trade in trading schemes such as the EU ETS. Despite coming under heavy criticism (see Evans, p134-135; and Burniaux et al., p58-65), the theory is that as the marginal cost of environmental abatement is lower in non-Annex B countries a scheme like this will promote technology transfer from Annex B to non-Annex B countries resulting in cheaper emissions reductions. Because under consumption-based emissions accounting a country is responsible for the emissions caused by its imports, {{it is important for the}} importing country to encourage good environmental behaviour and promote the cleanest production technologies available in the exporting country. Therefore, unlike the Kyoto Protocol where the CDM was added later, consumption-based emissions accounting inherently promotes clean development in the foreign country because of the way it allocates emissions. One loophole that remains relevant is ‘carbon colonialism’ whereby developed countries do not mitigate the underlying problem but simply continue to increase consumption offsetting this by exploiting the abatement potential of developing countries.|$|E

Bodylevel model reduction such modal synthesis is typically used to decrease the computational load of a simulation, but this cannot fully meet the demands for real-time simulation of <b>flexible</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> In this research, Global Modal Parametrization, a model reduction technique initially proposed for controller design for <b>flexible</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> is further developed to speed up simulation of multibody systems. The reduction is achieved by a system-level modal description, {{as opposed to the}} classic body-level modal description. As the dynamics is configuration-dependent, the systemlevel modal description is chosen configuration-dependent {{in such a way that}} the system dynamics is optimally described with a minimal number of degrees of freedom. Another novelty is GMP-based simulation. In a numerical experiment, simulation results for the original model equations are compared with simulation results for the model equations obtained after model reduction, showing a good match. The approximation errors resulting from the model reduction techniques are investigated by comparing results for different mode sets. The mode set affects the approximation error similarly as it does in linear modal synthesis. status: publishe...|$|R
