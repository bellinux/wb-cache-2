Two days later, in a nationally {{televised}} address to {{a joint session of}} Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda. Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> would reduce bond interest rates.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{whether there}} is {{empirical}} evidence that <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> in the U.

Each of these estimations finds that private investment is apparently crowded out {{as a result of}} <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficits.</b> Also, it has been found here that this crowding-out phenomenon may have an important inflationary impact on the economy. This inflationary impact is presumably caused through a reduction in the rate at which productive capacity expands. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the impact of <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> upon the nominal long term rate of {{interest}} in the United States when, in addition to the usual potential interest-rate-influencing factors such as monetary policy, short term interest rates, the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit,</b> and inflationary expectations, net international capital flows into the United States have been accounted for. Using three alternative measures of long term interest rate yields, the 2 SLS estimations provided in this note provide strong empirical evidence that <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> in the United States exercise a positive and statistically significant influence over longer-term rates of interest despite the influence of net capital inflows. ...|$|R

25|$|Today's {{telephone}} {{excise tax}} {{derives from the}} Revenue Bill of 1932. Since then, it has been reauthorized 29 times. The 1932 Act was passed {{in response to a}} <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> brought about because of a decline in income tax receipts caused by an economic depression rather than as a result of war. Initially the tax was levied only on interstate (long-distance) service. The telephone excise tax was extended five times (between 1933 and 1941) before the tax was first applied to local telephone service.|$|E

40|$|This study examines, for {{the period}} 1963 - 1995, the impact of <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> in the US on {{interest}} rates at commercial banks. Interest rates at banks have been largely neglected in the deficit/interest rate literature for the US. Moreover, the deficit/interest rate literature for the US has effectively ignored {{the second half of}} the 1980 s and the 1990 s. Accordingly, this study empirically investigates the impact of <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> on the cost of deposits to banks and prime rate of interest charged by banks, while providing current/updated information on this important policy issue of the interest-rate impact of <b>budget</b> <b>deficits.</b> The estimates find the cost of deposits at banks to be an increasing function of the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> but the prime rate to be unaffected by the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|A July 2010 {{paper by}} Moody's Investors Service's chief {{economist}} Mark Zandl and former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan Blinder {{predicted that the}} US recession {{would have been far}} worse without the government intervention. They calculate that in the absence of both a monetary and fiscal response, unemployment would have peaked at about 16.5% instead of about 10%, the peak to trough GDP decline would have been about 12% instead of 4%. Despite the lack of deficit spending, without the intervention the 2010 and 2011 US <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> was forecast to be almost two times larger, due to the predicted collapse of tax receipts.|$|E
25|$|The New Deal tried public works, farm subsidies, {{and other}} devices to reduce unemployment, but Roosevelt never {{completely}} {{gave up trying to}} balance the budget. Between 1933 and 1941 the average <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> was 3% per year. Roosevelt did not fully utilize deficit spending. The effects of federal public works spending were largely offset by Herbert Hoover's large tax increase in 1932, whose full effects for the first time were felt in 1933, and it was undercut by spending cuts, especially the Economy Act. According to Keynesians like Paul Krugman the New Deal therefore was not as successful in the short run {{as it was in the}} long run.|$|E

25|$|In late April 1898, Congress {{passed a}} {{resolution}} declaring that {{a state of war}} had existed since April 21, 1898, between the United States and Spain. Although the Spanish–American War was short, its financing needs resulted in a <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit.</b> In the landmark case of Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Co. the Supreme Court had nullified the income tax of 1894. Many in Congress felt that tariff increases could create too much disturbance with industry. As a result, the leaders in Congress felt that the revenues required for military expenditures either should come from increases in existing domestic taxes or supplements of new taxes of the same type. Thus, in the War Revenue Act of 1898, an excise tax on telephone service was introduced {{for the first time in}} 1898. The tax was repealed in 1902, at the end of the Spanish-American related Philippine-American War.|$|E
25|$|The public's {{concern about}} the <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> and fears of {{professional}} politicians allowed the independent candidacy of billionaire Texan Ross Perot to explode {{on the scene in}} dramatic fashion—at one point Perot was leading the major party candidates in the polls. Perot crusaded against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and internal and external national debt, tapping into voters' potential fear of the deficit. His volunteers succeeded in collecting enough signatures to get his name on the ballot in all 50 states. In June, Perot led the national public opinion polls with support from 39% of the voters (versus 31% for Bush and 25% for Clinton). Perot severely damaged his credibility by dropping out of the presidential contest in July and remaining out of the race for several weeks before re-entering. He compounded this damage by eventually claiming, without evidence, that his withdrawal was due to Republican operatives attempting to disrupt his daughter's wedding.|$|E
25|$|The National Energy Program had {{a number}} of other flaws. It was based on a world price {{steadily}} increasing to $100 per barrel. The world oil price declined to as little as $10 per barrel in the years following. Since the federal government based its spending on the larger figure, the result was that it {{spent a great deal of}} money on subsidies that could not be recovered in taxes on production. Furthermore, due to proximity to the U.S. market companies had opportunities to make money by playing differentials in prices. For instance, refiners in Eastern Canada would import oil subsidized down to half the world price, refine it into products, and export the products to the U.S. at full world price. Airlines flying between Europe and the U.S. via the polar route would take off with as little fuel as possible, and stop briefly in Canada to fill up before continuing on to their destination. Trucking companies operating between locations in the Northern U.S. would detour their trucks through Canada to refuel. None of these transactions was illegal, or even unusual considering the integrated nature of the economies, but all had the effect of transferring billions of Canadian tax dollars to the balance sheets of (mostly foreign owned) companies. A third flaw was that the NEP assumed that future oil discoveries would be made in areas under federal jurisdiction, such as the Arctic and offshore. As it turned out, most of the major oil discoveries in Canada had already been made, and the subsidies given by the federal government to companies exploring in federal jurisdiction were not productive. All of these flaws resulted in large, and unexpected, increases in the <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit.</b>|$|E
