5|$|During battles, {{a weapon}} limit gauge is shown, filling up over time; by waiting to attack until the gauge is filled up, the player {{can use a}} more {{powerful}} attack specific to the currently equipped weapon. The gauge resets to zero whenever the player attacks or gets hit by an attack. The player is able to use various different types of weapons, such as swords, axes and <b>flails,</b> each having a different attack pattern: sword attacks, for example, are mid-ranged swings and stabs, while flail attacks are long-ranged and reach out {{in a straight line}} from the hero. Most weapons {{can also be used to}} affect the environment: the player can cut down trees with axes, for instance. There are also variants of each weapon type with bonus strengths, such as flame variations, which are effective against ice monsters. At various points in the game, the hero is accompanied by non-player characters who help the player defeat enemies. These companions have different abilities that the player can use, such as Fuji's healing spell and Watt's shop.|$|E
5|$|Hanada and Kasuga {{pick up a}} car {{designated}} for the job which unexpectedly has a corpse in the back seat. They dispose of the body, then meet the client and proceed towards their destination. En route Hanada spots an ambush. He dispatches a number of gunmen while Kasuga panics and <b>flails</b> about in hysterics. Foaming at the mouth, Kasuga charges an ambusher, Koh, the fourth-ranked hitman, and they kill each other. Hanada leaves the client to secure Koh's car but hears three gunshots and rushes back to find the client is safe and three additional ambushers have been shot cleanly through the forehead. At a second ambush, Hanada kills more gunmen and sets Sakura, the second-ranked hitman, on fire. Sakura madly rushes towards the client but is shot dead by him. On his way home Hanada's car breaks down. Misako, a mysterious woman with a deathwish, stops and gives him a ride. At home, he has rough sex with his wife, fueled by his obsession with sniffing boiling rice.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} in southern Poland that clouds and hail were produced by creatures named płanetnik, chmurnik, or obłocznik: they compressed fog into clouds, and fragmented ice with iron <b>flails</b> into hailstones. They {{were considered to}} be the spirits of infants who had died without baptism, or the spirits of drowned and hanged people. Such spirits were seen in Serbia as bringers of hail clouds; they were addressed in folk spells, with which they were made to lead the clouds away from the village. According to other notions, płanetniks were persons who flew into the sky during storms. They could fly in spirit, while they were in deep sleep, or they could fly in body and soul. The płanetniks were friendly toward humans, often warning them about the approach of a storm or hail. They could direct the movement of clouds.|$|E

5|$|On October 6, at 14:00, {{as part of}} Operation Badr, over 200 Egyptian {{aircraft}} {{participated in}} an air strike against various Israeli targets in the Sinai. As part of the strike, IL-28 tactical bombers attacked Fort Budapest. The bombers were moderately accurate, some of the bombs finding their targets and others landing outside the fort's perimeter. Budapest was also targeted by an artillery barrage, beginning at 14:05. While the fire preparation was underway, the Sa'iqa company moved out of Port Said to conduct its landing east of the fort. At {{the same time the}} main attacking force began moving from its positions east of Port Fouad. In the lead were three T-34s with mine <b>flails</b> to breach the minefield, closely followed by combat engineers, and then the advance fireteams. Behind these, forming the first echelon of the battalion, was a platoon in amphibious vehicles supported by the three remaining T-34s.|$|E
5|$|Capturing Fort Budapest fell {{within the}} {{responsibility}} of the Port Said Sector, an Egyptian military command independent of the Second Field Army to the south. The commander of the sector, Major General Omar Khalid, assigned the task of capturing the fort to the 135th Independent Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Salah 'Abd el-Halim. The 135th was also tasked with capturing another position, Fort Orkal, so Salah committed one battalion under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Ali al-Mezahi to capture Budapest. However, Salah had the following reinforcements: six obsolete T-34 tanks equipped with mine <b>flails</b> to breach the Israeli minefield, eight amphibious armored vehicles, a 120 mm mortar company, and a company of the 128th Sa'iqa Group (Sa'iqa, meaning lightning, were Egyptian commando forces). The Sa'iqa company would join the attack via a naval landing and would be separated into two groups. One group would land four kilometers east of Budapest to isolate it and prevent Israeli reinforcements from reaching the fort. The other group would land one kilometer east of Budapest, and then attack the fort. The main assault would come from the west, to be carried out by the battalion and the six tanks. The battalion would attack from Port Fouad, {{the only part of the}} Sinai under Egyptian control.|$|E
5|$|Specialised armour {{arriving}} in the first wave included AVREs, mine <b>flails,</b> and armoured bulldozers. Clearing paths off the beach proved difficult, as the tanks got stuck in the mud or were taken out by mines. A lone mine flail tank finally cleared a path from the beach up toward the Mont Fleury Battery and Ver-Sur-Mer. This route {{was used by the}} Green Howards and tanks of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards, who cleared the remaining resistance at the Mont Fleury Battery. B Company moved on to attack trench positions and machine gun emplacements at Meuvaines Ridge, while C Company moved to the west of Ver-Sur-Mer to help cover the assault on Crépon, where roads led to the important targets of Bayeux and Caen. The 7th Green Howards attacked the gun battery at Ver-Sur-Mer, where they took 50 prisoners. Colour Sergeant-Major Stanley Hollis earned the only Victoria Cross to be bestowed for actions on D-Day. On the way to the Mont Fleury Battery, Hollis came under machine gun fire while investigating a pillbox, so he shot into the entrance with his Sten gun and dropped a grenade through the roof, killing most of the occupants. He cleared a nearby trench of enemy soldiers, whereupon the occupants of a second pillbox surrendered. Later in the day, he saved the lives of three men during an attempt to take out a field artillery installation at a farm near Crépon.|$|E

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} scant {{academic}} consideration paid to investigations of mitral leaflet <b>flail</b> {{in terms of}} clinical profile, surgical strategy, and surgical outcome. Methods: One hundred consecutive patients with mitral leaflet <b>flail</b> referred for surgical treatment in the past 42 / 3 years were included in this study. Results: The most common reasons leading to mitral leaflet <b>flail</b> were chord rupture (38 %), myxomatous degeneration (23 %), and combined chord rupture and myxomatous degeneration (12 %). Mitral leaflet <b>flail</b> was predominantly characterized by independent P 2 <b>flail,</b> followed by P 2, 3 <b>flail</b> and independent A 2 <b>flail.</b> Chord rupture occurred in 54 patients, and the most commonly involved segments were P 2, P 2, 3, and P 3. The most common risk factors for mitral valve replacement were papillary muscle rupture, extensive myxomatous degeneration, exten-sive chord rupture, and severely dilated mitral valve annulus. Multivariate regression analy-ses demonstrated {{that the development of}} mitral leaflet <b>flail</b> was significantly associated with the pertinent variables tested, especially correlated with insertion of the prosthetic ring, number of artificial chord, and presence of carotid stenosis...|$|R
25|$|The Umayyads delayed {{their attack}} to so {{late in the}} year {{probably}} because part of the army needed to live off the land as they advanced. They had to wait until the area's wheat harvest was ready and then until a reasonable amount of the harvest was threshed (slowly by hand with <b>flails)</b> and stored.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{was first}} {{introduced}} to the Western Hemisphere following {{the discovery of the}} New World in the 15th century, wheat came to be grown in North American soil only during the colonial period. During the colonial period, wheat was sown by broadcasting; reaped by sickles, and threshed by <b>flails.</b> The kernels were then taken to a grist mill for grinding into flour.|$|E

5000|$|Asymmetric {{prolapse}} {{is further}} subdivided into <b>flail</b> and non-flail. <b>Flail</b> prolapse {{occurs when a}} leaflet tip turns outward, becoming concave toward the left atrium, causing {{the deterioration of the}} mitral valve. The severity of <b>flail</b> leaflet varies, ranging from tip eversion to chordal rupture. Dissociation of leaflet and chordae tendineae provides for unrestricted motion of the leaflet (hence [...] "flail leaflet"). Thus patients with <b>flail</b> leaflets have a higher prevalence of mitral regurgitation than those with the non-flail subtype.|$|R
40|$|<b>Flail</b> {{chest is}} a rare {{complication}} in pediatric patients with blunt chest trauma. There is no general consensus on which treatment is most appropriate for <b>flail</b> chest in pediatric patients, {{although it has been}} reported that surgical fixation is associated with beneficial outcomes for <b>flail</b> chest in adults. The present report described two pediatric cases of <b>flail</b> chest, which was rare in pediatric blunt trauma. In small children, functional residual capacity is smaller, and the thorax is pliable due to high thoracic compliance. Therefore, it is only advisable to select intubation and mechanical ventilation treatment. Likewise, in pediatric <b>flail</b> chest, the available evidence does not suggest that ventilator management protocols should be adopted routinely, and the treatment for pediatric <b>flail</b> chest was not established completely. There were not huge different between the described patients, including injury severity and ventilation setting. However, one had a relapse of <b>flail</b> chest after extubation and chest taping was required, while the other patient’s condition was stable after decannulation. As described above, it is difficult to predict a recurrence of <b>flail</b> chest in pediatric patients even if treatment goes well. Therefore, T-piece trial should be considered prior to extubation...|$|R

25|$|The main {{methods used}} for {{humanitarian}} demining on land are: manual detection using metal detectors and prodders, detection by specially trained mine detection dogs, and mechanical clearance using armored vehicles fitted with <b>flails,</b> tiller or similar devices. There is an organization, APOPO, that is training African rats to detect landmines much as dogs do, offering a local solution to countries in Africa. In many circumstances, the only method {{that meets the}} United Nations' requirements for effective humanitarian demining, the International Mine Action Standards (IMAS), is manual detection and disarmament. The process is typically slow, expensive and dangerous, although demining can be safer than construction work if procedures are followed rigorously. New technologies may provide effective alternatives.|$|E

40|$|AbstractChordal rupture with a {{subsequent}} <b>flail</b> mitral valve leaflet {{is now the}} most common cause of pure mitral regurgitation. To describe the Doppler color flow findings in <b>flail</b> mitral leaflet and the determinants of these findings, Doppler color flow mapping and conventional Doppler echocardiography were performed in 31 consecutive patients presenting with a <b>flail</b> mitral leaflet. In the 23 patients with a posterior <b>flail</b> leaflet, a distinctive highly eccentric and turbulent jet directed toward the posterior wall of the aorta was noted. In the eight patients with an anterior <b>flail</b> leaflet, a jet directed toward the posterolateral left atrial wall was noted. Maximal regurgitant jet area was significantly larger in patients with a <b>flail</b> anterior leaflet (13. 1 ± 3. 0 cm 2) than in those with a <b>flail</b> posterior leaflet (5. 8 ± 3. 0 cm 2, p = 0. 0001). Maximal jet area to left atrial ratio was also significantly higher in those with a <b>flail</b> anterior leaflet (0. 56 ± 0. 16) than in those with a <b>flail</b> posterior leaflet (0. 27 ± 0. 17, p = 0. 0006). When systolic left atrial velocities encoded as red were incorporated into the maximal jet area measurement, 7 of the 8 patients with an anterior <b>flail</b> leaflet had a jet area > 8 cm 2, consistent with severe mitral regurgitation, compared with 13 of the 23 patients with a <b>flail</b> posterior leaflet. There was no correlation between jet area or jet area to left atrial ratio and any hemodynamic variable. Patients with acute mitral regurgitation exhibited a trend toward smaller jet areas, but this did not reach statistical significance. Regurgitant fraction calculated from pulsed Doppler recording of mitral and aortic flow was consistent with moderately severe or severe mitral regurgitation in all cases and averaged 70 %. Thus, patients with a <b>flail</b> mitral valve leaflet have distinctive Doppler color flow findings. A highly eccentric and turbulent jet directed posteriorly to the aorta may contribute to a systematic underestimation of severe mitral regurgitation by conventional Doppler color flow criteria. The use of pulsed Doppler ultrasound to calculate regurgitant fraction in patients with a <b>flail</b> mitral valve leaflet may be helpful in reliably assessing the degree of mitral regurgitation...|$|R
25|$|When alfalfa {{is to be}} used as hay, it {{is usually}} cut and baled. Loose haystacks are still used in some areas, but bales are easier for use in transportation, storage, and feed. Ideally, the first cutting should be taken at the bud stage, and the {{subsequent}} cuttings just as the field is beginning to flower, or one-tenth bloom because carbohydrates are at their highest. When using farm equipment rather than hand-harvesting, a swather cuts the alfalfa and arranges it in windrows. In areas where the alfalfa does not immediately dry out on its own, a machine known as a mower-conditioner is used to cut the hay. The mower-conditioner has a set of rollers or <b>flails</b> that crimp and break the stems as they pass through the mower, making the alfalfa dry faster. After the alfalfa has dried, a tractor pulling a baler collects the hay into bales.|$|E
25|$|During combat, {{the player}} {{character}} is Agrippa, who can use various gladiatorial weapons such as swords, scimitars, maces, spears, bows, slingshots and <b>flails.</b> If Agrippa has severed {{the arm of}} an enemy, he can {{pick it up and}} also use it as a weapon. However, weapons can only be used for {{a certain amount of time}} before they break. During combat, a meter indicates the remaining vitality of Agrippa's weapon(s) and helmet (if he has one equipped). Agrippa can attack with his main weapon, his sub-weapon or shield, or with a two-handed weapon. The player can lock on to enemies to make Agrippa target them. Agrippa can also throw weapons at his enemies, and can fight with his fists, using strong and soft punches as well as shoulder tackles. If timed correctly, Agrippa can also steal weapons from his enemies, or knock their weapons out of their hands using a shoulder tackle. He can also attack from the ground by flinging sand into an approaching enemy's face, and he can attack downed enemies by stomping on them or stabbing them. If Agrippa stands behind a groggy enemy he can perform a suplex on them.|$|E
25|$|After the American Civil War, {{the western}} Mississippi Valley and the Great Plains to its west, where large fertile lands were available, {{resulted}} in expanding wheat farming. By this time, better tillage equipment was in use, railroads provided {{better access to}} world markets, better trading and warehousing facilities were facilitated, and more particularly introduction of hard winter was introduced. In the 1870s, Turkey red wheat, a hard variety of wheat, {{was introduced to the}} farmlands of Kansas by Russian Mennonite immigrants. This wheat variety spread quickly. New technology substantially enhanced productivity in the 19th century, as sowing with drills replaced broadcasting, cradles took the place of sickles, and the cradles in turn were replaced by reapers and binders. Steam-powered threshing machines superseded <b>flails.</b> By 1895, in Bonanza farms in the Dakotas, it took six different people and 36 horses pulling huge harvesters, working 10 hours a day, to produce 20,000 bushels. Following the invention of the steel roller mill in 1878, hard varieties of wheat such as Turkey Red became more popular than soft, which had been previously preferred because they were easier for grist mills to grind.|$|E
50|$|Such large hedge {{trimmers}} {{are often}} confused with tractor-mounted reach <b>flail</b> mowers (booms with <b>flail</b> mower attachments), which appear similar {{due to the}} use of booms. And in colloquial language both, tractor-mounted hedge trimmers and reach <b>flail</b> mowers, are imprecisely called hedge cutters, or brush cutters. In contrast to tractor-mounted hedge trimmers, reach <b>flail</b> mowers have a different cutting mechanism, and are not only used for trimming hedges, but also in several other fields of application (mowing taller grass, road verge cutting, ditch maintenance, etc.).|$|R
5000|$|An {{innovation}} was {{the addition}} of cutters to the rotor that cut barbed wire and stopped the <b>flail</b> from becoming tangled. This feature made the Crab very effective at tearing up barbed wire obstacles. In the initial Crab design, the <b>flail</b> arms were raised and lowered hydraulically to set {{the height of the}} <b>flail.</b> The Mark II version of the Crab, developed as [...] "Contouring Crab", switched to a counterweighted jib that naturally assumed the right height in balance to the force exerted by the rotating <b>flail.</b> This ensured mines buried under a dip in the ground would not be missed. A blast shield between the <b>flail</b> and the tank gave added protection from detonating mines. The hull machine gun was removed, as the blast shield and <b>flail</b> blocked its field of fire. The Crab weighed 32 tons - around two tons more than a normal Sherman.|$|R
50|$|Assessing <b>flail</b> {{effectiveness}} is difficult, {{as it is}} hard to distinguish between a mine that has been missed by the <b>flail</b> and an aged, malfunctioning mine that has been struck but has failed to detonate. To be sure which is the case, it would be necessary to disassemble the mine and examine its fuze - a lengthy and dangerous procedure that is hardly ever carried out in the field. Because of this, all apparently intact mines are reported as being 'missed' by the <b>flail</b> and {{it has been suggested that}} this leads to an under-reporting of the mine <b>flail's</b> clearance reliability.|$|R

40|$|Mitral valve {{repair and}} {{replacement}} (MVR) are effective treatments for mitral regurgitation (MR) from prolapse (MVP) and/or <b>flail.</b> Mitral repair preserves LV function and avoids anticoagulation {{but is not}} always feasible.
