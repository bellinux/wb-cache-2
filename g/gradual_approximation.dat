Those circumstances which tend to facilitate the charge of the air by the excited conductor, and also those which tend to keep the tension at the same degree notwithstanding the discharge, assist in producing the glow; whereas those which tend to resist the charge of the air or other dielectric, and those which favour the accumulation of electric force prior to discharge, which, sinking by that act, has to be exalted before the tension can again acquire the requisite degree, favour intermitting discharge, and, therefore, the production of brush or spark. Thus, rarefaction of the air, the removal of large conducting surfaces from the neighbourhood of the glowing termination, the presentation of a sharp point towards it, help to sustain or produce the glow: but the condensation of the air, {{the presentation of the}} hand or other large surface, the <b>gradual</b> <b>approximation</b> of a discharging ball, tend to convert the glow into brush or even spark. All these circumstances may be traced and reduced, in a manner easily comprehensible, to their relative power of assisting to produce, either a continuous discharge to the air, which gives the glow; or an interrupted one, which produces the brush, and, in a more exalted condition, the spark.|$|E
60|$|While {{many will}} regret this {{multiplication}} of schemes of juvenile culture, the catholic observer will discern in it {{a means of}} ensuring the final establishment of a rational system. Whatever may be thought of theological dissent, {{it is clear that}} dissent in education results in facilitating inquiry by the division in labour. Were we in possession of the true method, divergence from it would, of course, be prejudicial; but the true method having to be found, the efforts of numerous independent seekers carrying out their researches in different directions, constitute a better agency for finding it than any that could be devised. Each of them struck by some new thought which probably contains more or less of basis in facts--each of them zealous on behalf of his plan, fertile in expedients to test its correctness, and untiring in his efforts to make known its success--each of them merciless in his criticism on the rest; there cannot fail, by composition of forces, to be a <b>gradual</b> <b>approximation</b> of all towards the right course. Whatever portion of the normal method any one has discovered, must, by the constant exhibition of its results, force itself into adoption; whatever wrong practices he has joined with it must, by repeated experiment and failure, be exploded. And by this aggregation of truths and elimination of errors, there must eventually be developed a correct and complete body of doctrine. Of the three phases through which human opinion passes--the unanimity of the ignorant, the disagreement of the inquiring, and the unanimity of the wise--it is manifest that the second is the parent of the third. They are not sequences in time only, they are sequences in causation. However impatiently, therefore, we may witness the present conflict of educational systems, and however much we may regret its accompanying evils, we must recognise it as a transition stage needful to be passed through, and beneficent in its ultimate effects.|$|E

The paper problematizes {{diagnostic}} {{work as a}} solely {{technical and}} rational activity by presenting an analysis focused on the social and organizational practices in which diagnosis is embedded. The analysis of a troubleshooting episode in an Italian internet company shows how diagnostic work is realized: 1) through collaboration sustained by specific knowledge distribution among designers (different but overlapping competences); 2) intersubjectively and discursively as an activity characterized by specific and diverse forms of participation and interwined with material intervention in the system; 3) following a situated rationality which proceeds by <b>gradual</b> <b>approximations</b> to achieve partial or provisional solutions while also taking account of organizational goals and needs.

40|$|The {{electrical}} properties of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are usually characterized by applying models initially developed for inorganic-based devices, which often implies {{the use of}} approximations that might be inappropriate for organic semiconductors. These approximations have brought limitations {{to the understanding of}} the device physics associated with organic materials. A strategy to overcome this issue is to establish straightforward connections between the macroscopic current characteristics and microscopic charge transport in OFETs. Here, a 3 D kinetic Monte Carlo model is developed that goes beyond both the conventional assumption of zero channel thickness and the <b>gradual</b> channel <b>approximation</b> to simulate carrier transport and current. Using parallel computing and a new algorithm that significantly improves the evaluation of electric potential within the device, this methodology allows the simulation of micrometer-sized OFETs. The current characteristics of representative OFET devices are well reproduced, which provides insight into the validity of the <b>gradual</b> channel <b>approximation</b> in the case of OFETs, the impact of the channel thickness, and the nature of microscopic charge transport...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have spoken}} throughout, for argument's sake, {{as though the}} only {{interest}} {{to be considered in}} the married relation were the interests of the offspring, and so ultimately of the race at large, rather than of the persons themselves who enter into it. But I do not quite see why each generation should thus be sacrificed to the welfare of the generations that afterwards succeed it. Now {{it is one of the}} strongest points in favour of the system of falling in love that it does, by common experience in the vast majority of instances, assort together persons who subsequently prove themselves thoroughly congenial and helpful to one another. And this result I look upon as one great proof of the real value and importance of the instinct. Most men and women select for themselves partners for life at an age when they know but little of the world, when they judge but superficially of characters and motives, when they still make many mistakes in the conduct of life and in the estimation of chances. Yet most of them find in after days that they have really chosen out of all the world one of the persons best adapted by native idiosyncrasy to make their joint lives enjoyable and useful. I make every allowance for the effects of habit, for the growth of sentiment, for the <b>gradual</b> <b>approximation</b> of tastes and sympathies; but surely, even so, it is a common consciousness with every one of us who has been long married, that we could hardly conceivably have made ourselves happy with any of the partners whom others have chosen; and that we have actually made ourselves so with the partners we chose for ourselves under the guidance of an almost unerring native instinct. Yet adaptation between husband and wife, so far as their own happiness is concerned, can have had comparatively little to do with the evolution of the instinct, as compared with adaptation for the joint production of vigorous and successful offspring. Natural selection lays almost all the stress on the last point, and hardly any at all upon the first one. If, then, the instinct is found on the whole so trustworthy in the minor matter, for which it has not specially been fashioned, how far more trustworthy and valuable must it probably prove in the greater matter--greater, I mean, as regards the interests of the race--for which it has been mainly or almost solely developed! ...|$|E
60|$|It may be objected {{that this}} is an {{idealized}} proposal, and that existing conditions, which are, of course, the material out of which new conditions are to be made do not present anything like this form. As a matter of fact, if only the reader will allow for a certain difference in terminology, they do. What I have here called Schooling is, so far as the age of the pupils go, typically presented in Great Britain by what is called the elementary school, and in America by the public school, and certain schools that unanalytical people in England, mistaking a social for an educational difference, seem disposed to class with secondary schools, the inferior Grammar Schools, the cheaper private schools, and what are called Preparatory Schools, [Footnote: As things are, there is no doubt a considerable advantage in the child from a good home going on to a good preparatory school instead of entering a public elementary school, and the passage above must not be misread as a sweeping condemnation of such establishments.] are really also elementary schools. The latter have more social pretension and sometimes far less efficiency than a Government Elementary School, but that is all the difference. All these schools admit of a <b>gradual</b> <b>approximation</b> to the ideal of schooling already set forth in the sixth of these papers. Some are already within a measureable distance of that ideal. And above these elementary schools, above the School grade proper, and answering to what is here called College, there is a great variety of day and evening schools of the most varied description which agree all of them in the presentation of a second phase in the educational process beginning about the age of thirteen to sixteen and going on to nineteen and twenty. In Great Britain such institutions are sometimes called secondary schools and sometimes colleges, and they have no distinct boundary line to separate them from the University proper, on the one hand, or the organized Science Schools and the Higher Grade Board Schools and evening classes of the poorer sort. The Universities and medical schools are, indeed, hampered with work quite similar to that of secondary schools and which the secondary schools have failed to do, the Cambridge undergraduate before his Little-Go, the London University medical student before his Preliminary Scientific Examination, are simply doing the belated work of this second stage. And there is, I doubt not, a similar vague complexity in America. But through the fog something very like the boundary line here placed about fourteen is again and again made out; not only the general requirements for efficient education, but the trend of present tendency seems to be towards a scheme of three stages in which a first stage of nine or ten years of increasingly serious Schooling (Primary Education), from a very light beginning about five up to about fourteen, is to be followed by a second stage of College education (Secondary Education), from fourteen or sixteen to an upward boundary determined by class and various facilities, and this is to be succeeded by a third stage, which we will now proceed to consider in detail.|$|E
60|$|Had {{teachers}} been {{guided by}} Nature's hints, {{not only in}} making drawing a part of education but in choosing modes of teaching it, {{they would have done}} still better than they have done. What is that the child first tries to represent? Things that are large, things that are attractive in colour, things round which its pleasurable associations most cluster--human beings from whom it has received so many emotions; cows and dogs which interest by the many phenomena they present; houses that are hourly visible and strike by their size and contrast of parts. And which of the processes of representation gives it most delight? Colouring. Paper and pencil are good in default of something better; but a box of paints and a brush--these are the treasures. The drawing of outlines immediately becomes secondary to colouring--is gone through mainly with a view to the colouring; and if leave can be got to colour a book of prints, how great is the favour! Now, ridiculous as such a position will seem to drawing-masters who postpone colouring and who teach form by a dreary discipline of copying lines, we believe that the course of culture thus indicated is the right one. The priority of colour to form, which, as already pointed out, has a psychological basis, should be recognised from the beginning; and from the beginning also, the things imitated should be real. That greater delight in colour which is not only conspicuous in children but persists in most persons throughout life, should be continuously employed as the natural stimulus to the mastery of the comparatively difficult and unattractive form: the pleasure of the subsequent tinting should be the prospective reward for the labour of delineation. And these efforts to represent interesting actualities should be encouraged; in the conviction that as, by a widening experience, simpler and more practicable objects become interesting, they too will be attempted; and that so a <b>gradual</b> <b>approximation</b> will be made towards imitations having some resemblance to the realities. The extreme indefiniteness which, in conformity with the law of evolution, these first attempts exhibit, is anything but a reason for ignoring them. No matter how grotesque the shapes produced; no matter how daubed and glaring the colours. The question is not whether the child is producing good drawings. The question is, whether it is developing its faculties. It has first to gain some command over its fingers, some crude notions of likeness; and this practice is better than any other for these ends, since it is the spontaneous and interesting one. During early childhood no formal drawing-lessons are possible. Shall we therefore repress, or neglect to aid, these efforts at self-culture? or shall we encourage and guide them as normal exercises of the perceptions and the powers of manipulation? If by furnishing cheap woodcuts to be painted, and simple contour-maps to have their boundary lines tinted, we can not only pleasurably draw out the faculty of colour, but can incidentally produce some familiarity with the outlines of things and countries, and some ability to move the brush steadily; and if by the supply of tempting objects we can keep up the instinctive practice of making representations, however rough; it must happen that when the age for lessons in drawing is reached, there will exist a facility that would else have been absent. Time will have been gained; and trouble, both to teacher and pupil, saved.|$|E

50|$|The {{contradictions and}} paradoxes of liberal society, by {{undermining}} {{the rule of}} law and the ideals it represents, ultimately give rise to what Unger calls postliberal society.

The state's pretense of being a neutral guardian of the social order is abandoned. These trends are reflected in the rise of open-ended clauses in legislation, administration, and adjudication, and a concern with substantive justice over formal justice.

Unger argues that these welfare state institutions are an assault on the legal order, while the corporatist tendencies in postliberal society undermine bureaucratic law.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONPrimary {{closure of}} the {{abdominal}} wall following intestinal transplantation or multivisceral transplantation could become a challenging problem in {{a significant number of}} patients. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 38 -year-old woman with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) underwent a multi-visceral transplantation for short gut syndrome. She subsequently developed acute graft rejection that proved resistant to conventional treatment. She was relisted and underwent re-transplantation along with kidney transplantation. Abdominal wall closure could not be achieved because of the large size of the graft and bowel oedema. The wound was initially managed with laparostomy followed by insertion of the delayed dynamic abdominal closure (DDAC) device (Abdominal Retraction Anchor – ABRA® system). Continuous dynamic traction to the wound edges resulted in <b>gradual</b> <b>approximation</b> and complete {{closure of the}} abdominal wound was achieved within 3 weeks. DISCUSSIONSuccessful abdominal closure after multivisceral transplantation or isolated intestinal transplantation often requires biological mesh, vascularised flaps or abdominal wall transplantation. DDAC eliminated the need for a prosthetic mesh or skin graft and provided an excellent cosmetic result. Adjustment of the dynamic traction at the bedside minimised the need for multiple returns to the operating theatre. It resulted in a well-healed linear scar without a hernia.

It is rather an open and ongoing process, which evolves according to forms of <b>gradual,</b> never-ending <b>approximation.</b> From this perspective, it may be seen that signficant progress has already been made, towards a convergence rather than a progressive divergence among national criminal law systems, as in the case, precisely, of the criminalisation of participation in criminal organisations...|$|R
40|$|This work {{introduces}} a compact DC model developed for organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and its SPICE implementation. The model {{relies on a}} modified version of the <b>gradual</b> channel <b>approximation</b> that takes into account the contact effects, occurring at nonohmic metal/organic semiconductor junctions, modeling them as reverse biased Schottky diodes. The model also comprises channel length modulation and scalability of drain current with respect to channel length. To show the suitability of the model, we used it to design an inverter and a ring oscillator circuit. Furthermore, an experimental validation of the OTFTs has been done at the level of the single device as well as with a discrete-component setup based on two OTFTs connected into an inverter configuration. The experimental tests were based on OTFTs that use small molecules in binder matrix as an active layer. The experimental data on the fabricated devices have been found in good agreement with SPICE simulation results, paving the way to the use of the model and the device for the design of OTFT-based integrated circuits. This work was supported in part by the MIUR by means of the national Program PON R&C 2007 - 2013 and in part by project “Elettronica su Plastica per Sistemi Smart disposable” PON 02 00355 3416798...|$|R
40|$|MOSFET {{degradation}} due to {{hot carrier}} injection {{is the most}} important reliability issue in realizing submicron ultra-large scaled integrated circuits. This degradation has been widely studied and lifetime simulators have also been developed for digital circuit operation [1]-[2]. On the other hand, the degradation of analog device parameters such as drain conductance due to hot carrier injection are not clearly understood and modeled. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a physical model of analog drain conductance, gd degradation based on mobility reduction due to hot carrier generated interface states and show a reliability design guideline for analog devices. Fig. 1 shows gain degradation of a single MOSFET amplifier with a constant current source (Fig. 2) as a function of DC stress time. Since the gain of the amplifier is given by gain=g,/&, gm and were also measured and dg,=lg,-g,l and dgd=lgd 0 -gdl were plotted in Fig. 1. It has been found that the main cause of the gain degradation was gd degradation rather than &n degradation. Our model of gd degradation is based on the <b>gradual</b> channel <b>approximation</b> (GCA) and mobility reduction due to interface states generated by hot carrier injection [3]. When distribution of interface states generated by hot carrier injection is assumed to be a step function over the damaged region, the generated interface state density, Nits, is given by [4] where Le 8 is the effective gate length, L h g the length of the damaged region and a the mobility reduction factor. In the saturation region, a depletion region is formed between the pinch-off point and the drain as shown in Fig. 3. The drain current equation in the saturation region is given b...|$|R
