It had no knowledge of the institution of a public penance in the community of the church which could not be repeated, and which involved canonical obligations. Celtic penitential practices consisted of confession, acceptance of satisfaction fixed by the priest, and finally in reconciliation. They date back to 6th century. Penitential books native to the islands provided precisely determined penances for all offences, small and great. That kind of penance is called tariff penance.|$|E

This tax was introduced in 2006 through a reform that eliminated the [...] "RISK-system", which intended to avoid the double taxation of capital. The new shareholder model, introduced in 2006, aims to reduce the difference in taxation of capital and labor by taxing dividends beyond a certain level as ordinary income. This means that focus was moved from capital to individuals and their level of income.

This hypothesis, which specified {{that individuals with}} higher levels of core self-evaluations would prefer pay plans that offered greater risk and less certainty regarding the amount of pay received, was supported. Furthermore, it was also hypothesized that congruence between an individual's preferred pay plan characteristics and the actual type of pay plan that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> receives <b>would</b> result in higher levels of employee job satisfaction and pay satisfaction. This hypothesis was partially supported, as the relationship between congruence and job satisfaction was significant, while the relationship between congruence and pay satisfaction was not significant. Finally, it was hypothesized that the relationship between congruence and satisfaction would be moderated by the value that the individual places on money. This hypothesis was not supported. The results of this research indicate that personality characteristics may {{have a significant impact on}} the type of pay plan that an individual will prefer to receive. Furthermore, this research provides additional support for the belief that high levels of fit between the characteristics of individuals and the characteristics of the organizations for which they work will result in higher levels of employee satisfaction. Finally, the degree of importance that an individual places on money does not appear to alter the relationship between fit and satisfaction. These results have strong implications for businesses that wish to improve employee satisfaction and reduce employee turnover, as well as for individuals who are seeking occupations for which they will best be suited...|$|R

Although <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> become the acting prime minister on a temporary caretaker basis to ensure continuity of government function during the immediate period of transition, the {{deputy prime minister}} does not automatically become the new permanent prime minister: constitutional convention actually requires the governor general to consult the governing party regarding the permanent succession, and to call on {{a member of that}} party's caucus to assume the prime ministership. No policy or convention precludes the deputy prime minister from being chosen as the new prime minister in such a scenario, but none assures it, either—the party caucus would be free to recommend any new leader of its choice to the governor general. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the governor general is expected to follow the wishes of the party, although officially he or she retains the authority to make the final decision.

40|$|Synesthesia {{is a rare}} {{condition}} in which a stimulus from one modality automatically and consistently triggers unusual sensations in the same and/or other modalities. A relatively common and well-studied type is grapheme-color synesthesia, defined as the consistent experience of color when viewing, hearing and thinking about letters, words and numbers. We describe our method for investigating to what extent synesthetic associations between letters and colors can be learned by reading in color in nonsynesthetes. Reading in color is a special method for training associations {{in the sense that}} the associations are learned implicitly while the reader reads text as <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> normally <b>would</b> and it does not require explicit computer-directed training methods. In this protocol, participants are given specially prepared books to read in which four high-frequency letters are paired with four high-frequency colors. Participants receive unique sets of letter-color pairs based on their pre-existing preferences for colored letters. A modified Stroop task is administered before and after reading in order to test for learned letter-color associations and changes in brain activation. In addition to objective testing, a reading experience questionnaire is administered that is designed to probe for differences in subjective experience. A subset of questions may predict how well an individual learned the associations from reading in color. Importantly, we are not claiming that this method will cause each individual to develop grapheme-color synesthesia, only that it is possible for certain individuals to form letter-color associations by reading in color and these associations are similar in some aspects to those seen in developmental grapheme-color synesthetes. The method is quite flexible and can be used to investigate different aspects and outcomes of training synesthetic associations, including learning-induced changes in brain function and structure...|$|R

To be fair, one should still read the original article to gain a more complete understanding of the work conducted. Most of the articles included in this review were published in Drug Metabolism and Disposition or Chemical Research in Toxicology, but attempts were made to seek articles in 25 other journals. Importantly, these articles are not intended to represent a consensus of the best papers of the year, as {{we did not want to}} make any arbitrary standards for this purpose, but rather they were chosen by each author for their notable findings and descriptions of novel metabolic pathways or biotransformations.

40|$|The {{death penalty}} today {{provides}} virtually {{none of the}} benefits its advocates proffer as justifications for its existence. The tiny number of death sentences imposed, the even tinier number actually carried out, the enormous drain on public resources, and the decade-long delays that inevitably occur thoroughly undermine any deterrent or retributive benefits today’s death penalty might otherwise provide. In this paper, I argue for a compromise position that promises to better serve penal purposes and that will save states money at the same time: abandon the current dysfunctional death penalty {{in favor of a}} new ultimate sentence: death-in-prison. A sentence of death-in-prison would be exactly what it says: a prisoner sentenced to death-in-prison would remain in prison until <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> died. Death-in-prison <b>would</b> be a kind of hybrid sentence: like life in prison without possibility of parole (“LWOP”), death-in-prison would entail lifetime incarceration but no affirmative state action to terminate the prisoner’s life, but death-in-prison would also share several features of the conventional death penalty. As with the conventional death penalty, a special penalty trial would be needed to impose the ultimate death-in-prison sentence. In addition, persons sentenced to death-in-prison might continue to serve their sentences in special segregated “death rows. ” Death-in-prison sentences would also be imposed with all the magisterial weightiness of conventional death sentences. Persons so sentenced would be told, like those in conventional death penalty states, that the punishment for their crime is the ultimate one — death. If adopted, death-in-prison would reduce criminal justice expenditures, facilitate community healing, discourage divisive and ineffective commutation campaigns, and diminish wrongful executions, without forgoing what is arguably the greatest benefit of the current death penalty: the expressive value of imposing a “death” rather than a “life” sentence on highly culpable offenders...|$|R

Highway-railroad grade crossings are classified as either "active" or "passive" depending on the ability of the warning system to indicate the presence of an approaching train. Active crossings are characterized by warning systems such as flashing light signals, automatic gates, and/or bells which are activated by the detection of an approaching train. Often, low traffic volumes and limited funding do not warrant the expenditure required for installation of an active warning system. A passive crossing results, in that the presence of a crossing (rather than the presence of a train) is indicated by the location of the crossbucks. The driver is ultimately responsible for achieving safe passage across a passive crossing because no warning devices alert the driver of approaching trains. This research involved an investigation of driver behavior at active and passive grade crossings. The researcher observed the behavior of thirty drivers while accompanying the participant in his or her vehicle, directing the driver along a test course which incorporated eleven actual crossing scenarios. Driver behavior at grade crossings is indicative of the perceived risk the driver acknowledges. Likewise, observed behavior illustrates the degree of looking behavior and deceleration maneuvers drivers are likely to exhibit when encountering active and passive grade crossing scenarios. Differences were observed in the looking behavior and deceleration maneuvers exhibited by the participants at active and passive crossings along the test course. Drivers initiated more looking behavior at the passive crossings with the exception of an industrial spur track crossing. The observation of different driving behavior at active and passive crossings leads the researcher to infer that drivers apparently detected differences, either subconsciously or unconsciously, in the degree of warning installed at the crossing. The participants were later told the difference between active and passive grade crossings. The subject was then asked to describe what <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> should <b>or</b> <b>would</b> do when approaching these grade crossing scenarios. Although most responses reflected a general understanding of safe driving behavior at grade crossings, most subjects did not actually perform as they said they would when approaching the grade crossings along the test course...|$|R
