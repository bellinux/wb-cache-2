The development of Supergrids, which involves connecting national energy supply <b>grids</b> together via <b>interconnections,</b> has been proposed as a measure to overcome these challenges.

A key challenge for developing Supergrids is finding the most suitable countries with which to make an interconnection.

30|$|A {{limitation}} of the LCC-HVDC technology {{is the need to}} reverse direct voltage polarity to enact a change in the power flow direction; this limits the ability of an LCC-HVDC system to respond quickly to changing demand or market conditions [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. On the other hand, the VSC-HVDC does not need to reverse direct voltage polarity to change the power flow direction, which enables it as a promising solution for constructing MTDC systems. VSC-HVDC technology can also address other conventional grid issues, such as bulk power transmission, asynchronous <b>grid</b> <b>interconnections,</b> back-to-back AC system linking, and voltage/frequency support [20, 21, 22] and it is also suited to facilitate the large-scale integration of renewable energy sources into the grid [23].

5000|$|The {{electrical}} grids of the Hawaiian {{islands are}} each separate and relatively small. [...] "Overbuilding" [...] distributed solar {{in some areas}} has led to issues such as partial duck curve, although time-of-use pricing has reduced disadvantages. Such overbidding led the Hawaiian Electrical Company (HECO) to stop its net-metering program, which reimbursed solar consumers generously for the excess electricity they exported back to the grid, in 2015. As a result, residential solar installations fell as homeowners could no longer justify the costs because the payback time of the rooftop solar system made it cost-prohibitive. [...] Two successor programs - customer grid supply (CGS) and customer self-supply - have proved less successful than net-metering did in promoting {{the growth of the}} industry.

40|$|Since the {{development}} of large scale power <b>grid</b> <b>interconnections</b> and power markets, research on available transfer capability (ATC) has attracted great attention. The challenges for accurate assessment of ATC originate from the numerous uncertainties in electricity generation, transmission, distribution and utilization sectors. Power system uncertainties can be mainly described as two types: randomness and fuzziness. However, the traditional transmission reliability margin (TRM) approach only considers randomness. Based on credibility theory, this paper firstly built models of generators, transmission lines and loads according to their features of both randomness and fuzziness. Then a random fuzzy simulation is applied, along with a novel method proposed for ATC assessment, in which both randomness and fuzziness are considered. The bootstrap method and multi-core parallel computing technique are introduced to enhance the processing speed. By implementing simulation for the IEEE- 30 -bus system and a real-life system located in Northwest China, {{the viability of the}} models and the proposed method is verified...|$|R

40|$|First online: 07 March 2015 The {{dominating}} view in {{the literature}} is that renewable electricity production increases the price variance on spot markets for electricity. In this paper, we critically review this hypothesis.

The model predicts that the overall effect of IES infeed depends on the produced amount: while small to moderate quantities of IES tend to decrease the price variance, large quantities have the opposite effect. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we test these predictions using data from Germany, where investments in IES have been massive in the recent years. The results of this econometric analysis largely conform to the predictions from the theoretical model.
