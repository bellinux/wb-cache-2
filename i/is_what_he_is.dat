25|$|Aibara was a {{right-handed}} middle order batsman {{and often}} captained Hyderabad. He {{played a part}} in both of Hyderabad's two Ranji Trophy wins despite them being 50 years apart, as a player in 1937-38 where he scored the match winning hundred and as coach in 1986-87. His effort in the 1937-38 Final against Nawanagar <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> best remembered for, his innings of 137 not out came in a game where the next highest score by a player from either team was 67 and it was his maiden first-class hundred. Hyderabad had been dismissed for just 113 in their first innings and were set the task of chasing 310 to win in the fourth innings. Aibara came into bat with his side at 3 for 67 and guided Hyderabad home with just one wicket to spare.|$|E
500|$|Pujols did {{not perform}} very well to begin the 2012 season, batting [...]217 with no home runs and four RBIs {{in the month of}} April. Soon after the Angels called up top {{prospect}} Mike Trout and fired hitting coach Mickey Hatcher, Pujols's numbers began to rise, as he batted [...]323 with 13 home runs from May 15 through the All-Star Break. On July 31, he hit two home runs against Derek Holland in a 6–2 victory over the Rangers. After the game, Holland observed that Pujols had ended his early-season struggles: [...] "He's definitely turned it around, no doubt about it", he said. [...] "He <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> He had a slow start, but he's picked it up. He's a great hitter. He and Trout are doing a great job picking [...] up." [...] On August 14, Pujols had four RBI, including a game-winning three-run home run against Ubaldo Jiménez in a 9–6 victory over the Cleveland Indians. In 153 games, Pujols batted [...]285 with 173 hits, 50 doubles (second to Alex Gordon's 51), 30 home runs, 105 RBI (7th in AL), and 85 runs scored.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Associated Press, Morton stated that he asked Cruise for {{an interview}}, but was turned down: [...] "I asked Tom for an interview and he declined. The Church of Scientology has got a very controversial reputation and that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> linked with. An unauthorized biography would essentially be a compromise … I want to investigate it without any kind of fetters." [...] Morton consulted with private investigator and former adult film actor Paul Baressi, who investigated Cruise's private life. [...] He also consulted with Los Angeles, California attorney Graham Berry. [...] Baressi stated he had begun investigating Cruise after his marriage to Nicole Kidman ended, but after six years of research on the actor {{had not been able to}} find any evidence that Cruise was gay. [...] Baressi gave all of his research to Morton, and later told InTouch magazine: [...] "Everything I have found, and everything I know, points to Tom being heterosexual." [...] Morton also traveled to Toronto, Ontario, Canada to interview people who knew Cruise when he was filming Cocktail. [...] Several Paramount Pictures employees were interviewed about Cruise's termination by Sumner Redstone. [...] The book had initially been planned for a February 2006 publication date.|$|E
