40|$|Electrical {{discharge}} grinding is used {{to machine}} polycrystalline diamond layer of cutting tools, which can effectively drill composite/titanium stacks in modern aircraft frames. In the machine, an <b>electrode</b> <b>wheel</b> is rotated to accelerate debris flushing to quickly recover the dielectric fluid between a spark gap. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of the wheel speed on polycrystalline diamond removal rate for high erosion efficiency. Multiple wheel speeds were applied in a electrical discharge grinding machine under various pulse on-times and the volumetric removal rates were calculated by the precise position feedback of this machine over the time, which was obtained by the electrical waveform of discharges. The experimental results show that the removal rate increases with the wheel speed up to a limit at the low range and then declines at the high range. This indicates that the wheel speed needs to be optimized for high erosion efficiency under various discharge conditions such as different materials and pulse on-times...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a climbing robot for corrosion monitoring of reinforced concrete {{structures such as}} cooling towers, dams or bridges. The robot combines a vortex adhesion mechanism with a <b>wheel</b> <b>electrode</b> sensor for potential mapping of the concrete surface. A {{detailed description of the}} system is presented first. A special effort was made during the design in order to develop a lightweight device. The climbing robot is well suited for rough surfaces and can climb on vertical surfaces or move upside-down. The experiments that have been done to validate the concept are presented afterwards. They show that the climbing robot has several advantages over the traditional corrosion monitoring technique. This robot will therefore provide engineers in charge of infrastructure maintenance with the means to do their job much better than they can today. It offers them a way to circumvent all present barriers and brings a radical innovation in this area...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a climbing robot for inspection, condition assessment and monitoring of reinforced and post-tensioned concrete {{structures such as}} cooling towers, dams, parking-decks, bridges or buildings. The robot combines a vortex adhesion mechanism with a <b>wheel</b> <b>electrode</b> sensor for half-cell potential mapping of the concrete surface. Thus chloride-induced corrosion of the reinforcement can be detected during regular inspections {{at a very early}} stage, long before it manifests at the surface. The climbing robot is a lightweight device, well suited for rough surfaces which can climb on vertical surfaces or move upside-down. The robot can reach any part of a structure, even those usually not accessible. Regular inspections of any structures can be performed with the climbing robot for corrosion detection resulting in improved quality of the inspection, allowing the change from a reactive to a pro-active maintenance strategy. This robot will therefore provide engineers in charge of infrastructure maintenance with the means to do their job much better than they can today. It offers them a way to circumvent all present barriers and brings a radical innovation in this area...|$|R
