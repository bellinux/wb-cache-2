5|$|A key {{ingredient}} to the Hammond organ's success {{was the use}} of dealerships and a sense of community. Several dedicated organ dealers set up business in the United States and there was a bi-monthly newsletter, The Hammond Times, mailed out to subscribers. Advertisements tended to show families <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> instrument, often with a child playing it, as an attempt to show the organ as a center-point of home life and to encourage children to learn music.|$|E
5|$|On 5 November 2013, Anonymous protesters <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{world for}} the Million Mask March. Demonstrations were held in 400 cities {{around the world to}} {{coincide}} with Guy Fawkes Night. This hasn't been the only march and there were quite a few others over the years such as the 2015 march which formed into a riot and went out of control in London, UK.|$|E

5|$|After {{the ritual}} the priest {{delivers}} a short sermon, {{followed by the}} church choir singing Christmas songs; poems that praise the Nativity of Jesus Christ may be recited. In Montenegro, decasyllable Serbian epics are sung to an accompaniment played on the gusle, a traditional Serbian bowed string instrument. The celebration ends with parishioners <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> fire, served with cooked rakia, wine, or tea, and the food allowed during the Nativity Fast. Parishioners may pick a twig from the badnjak and take it home to place {{in front of their}} icon, or at another appropriate location.|$|E
5|$|Corder {{was taken}} back to Suffolk where he was tried at Shire Hall, Bury St Edmunds. The trial started on 7 August 1828, having been put back several days because of the {{interest}} which the case had generated. The hotels in Bury St Edmunds began to fill up from as early as 21 July, and admittance to the court was by ticket {{only because of the}} large numbers who wanted to view the trial. Despite this, the judge and court officials still had to push their way bodily through the crowds that had <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E
5|$|For {{the ancient}} Mediterraneans, saffron <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Cilician coastal town of Soli was of top value, {{particularly}} {{for use in}} perfumes and ointments. Herodotus and Pliny the Elder, however, rated rival Assyrian and Babylonian saffron from the Fertile Crescent as bestto treat gastrointestinal or renal upsets. Greek saffron from the Corycian Cave of Mount Parnassus was also of note: the color offered by the Corycian crocus {{is used as a}} benchmark in the Argonautica of Apollonius Rhodius and similarly with its fragrance in the epigrams of Martial.|$|E

The older of two sisters, Connie Bangs (Michelle Joyner) takes her sister Sara—who is clearly much younger than she is—to her bedroom and locks her in, warning her not to let her father inside. Connie runs out of the house, fighting off her father, and is later found wandering the streets confused. She is taken to clinical social worker Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher), and admits that her father has been sexually abusing her for years.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} gained international notoriety {{due in part}} to {{a photograph}} taken by photographer Frank Fournier of a young girl named Omayra Sánchez, who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died. Following the eruption, relief workers <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> girl, speaking with her and listening to her responses. She attracted the attention of the reporters at the site because of her sense of dignity and courage, and caused controversy when people wondered why the media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment).|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} morning, {{at first}} light, {{spurred on by}} the example provided by 11 Platoon, reinforcements from the 2/48th came up to complete the capture of Sattelberg. Just after dawn, a heavy artillery barrage was brought down on the summit by Australian artillery {{in preparation for the}} final attack. At 8:25am patrols were sent out from 'B' Company, 2/48th Battalion, and they subsequently reported that the Japanese had abandoned the position sometime during the night. Indeed, it was later established that Miyake, who had been in command of the troops <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> mission and had been given permission to abandon Sattelberg if the situation became untenable, had decided to withdraw from the position soon after Derrick's attack.|$|E

5|$|The museum hosts {{a number}} of annual events and some {{one-time}} railroading events that bring rail fans from across the country. In 2012, the Bob Julian Roundhouse was the stage for all 20 of Norfolk Southern's Heritage locomotives during a two-day photographic event. In 2014, the museum hosted Streamliners at Spencer, with notable 1930s - 1950s era locomotives <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Bob Julian Roundhouse turntable for a four-day event. Streamliners at Spencer included the Class J 611 Steam Passenger locomotive, visiting from the Virginia Museum of Transportation.

5|$|Villagers <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> burning {{windmill}} cheer {{the apparent}} {{death of the}} Monster (Boris Karloff). Their joy is tempered by the realization that Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is also apparently dead. Hans (Reginald Barlow), father of the girl the creature drowned in the previous film, {{wants to see the}} Monster's bones. He falls into a flooded pit underneath the mill, where the Monster– having survived the fire– strangles him. Hauling himself from the pit, the Monster casts Hans' wife (Mary Gordon) to her death. He next encounters Minnie (Una O'Connor), who flees in terror.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 29 April it was {{estimated}} that approximately 10,000 people had <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Embassy, while some 2,500 evacuees were in the Embassy and consular compounds. The crowds prevented the use of buses for transporting evacuees from the Embassy to the DAO Compound for evacuation and the Embassy gates were closed to prevent the crowd from surging through. Eligible evacuees now had to make themselves known to the Marine guards or Embassy staff manning the walls and were then lifted over the walls and into the Embassy compound. Among those arriving at the Embassy were Dr Phan Quang Dan, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for social welfare and refugee resettlement, and Lieutenant-General Dang Van Quang.|$|E

5|$|Equipped with ladders, ropes, {{weapons and}} ammunition, the {{soldiers}} managed {{to obtain the}} keys of the Battant through a man named Le Goux, after threatening civil law notary Jean Papay. After crossing the Battant Bridge, the soldiers entered the city and prepared to attack {{with the help of}} two townspeople; one named Recy, and the other an upholsterer named Augustin. The soldiers seized armaments located near the Battant, with the intention of sacking the archdiocese and churches, and killing Catholic priests and church leaders. The invaders then separated into groups: some <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Battant, while about 70 men, on horse and foot, reached the high street; those who were approaching the Battant passed along the Rue des Granges, a major street in Besançon. Both groups were assisted by many townspeople. By this time, the Protestant invaders had destroyed several houses (such as that of Madame de Thoraise of Chavirey), and an attack on the town hall wounded one Catholic.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May {{the broken}} {{remains of the}} two bower anchors, which were {{threatening}} to capsize the ship, were hauled in. During the following days the pack ice thickened, and in increasingly turbulent weather the boilers were closed down, since attempting to manoeuvre under power in these conditions would merely waste coal. Replenishing the ship's supply of fresh water was a further difficulty. A large iceberg was in view, but too far away in the prevailing weather conditions to be accessible, so to obtain drinking water the crew had to gather snow. Food was less of a problem; {{they were able to}} augment Aurora's food supplies from the penguins and seals that <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> ship. To boost morale the crew were given a ration of rum to celebrate Empire Day on 24 May.|$|E
5|$|At around 6a.m., {{a passing}} {{labourer}} saw women's items near a water-filled pit. One {{of the items}} was a woman's shoe with blood on it. He raised the alarm. He and others {{were able to use}} a rake to find a body in the pit– that of Mary Ashford. Two workers from a nearby factory found a series of footprints on the newly harrowed field near the pit, showing that {{a man and a woman}} had travelled together, almost up to the pit, and that the man returned alone. Ashford was known to many of those who <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> pit, as was the fact that she had gone to Tyburn the previous evening. The local mill owner, who took charge, went to Tyburn to discover with whom Ashford had left the party. Daniel Clarke, the landlord, began to ride towards Castle Bromwich to try to locate Thornton, and encountered him almost at once. When Clarke told Thornton of Ashford's death, Thornton stated that he was with her until 4a.m., and at Clarke's request went with him to Tyburn.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, after {{a hundred}} years of neglect, {{a part of the}} Mare aux Songes swamp was {{excavated}} by an international team of researchers (International Dodo Research Project). To prevent malaria, the British had covered the swamp with hard core during their rule over Mauritius, which had to be removed. Many remains were found, including bones of at least 17 dodos in various stages of maturity (though no juveniles), and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird, which have been preserved in their natural position. These findings were made public in December 2005 in the Naturalis museum in Leiden. 63% of the fossils found in the swamp belonged to turtles of the extinct Cylindraspis genus, and 7.1% belonged to dodos, which had been deposited within several centuries, 4,000 years ago. Subsequent excavations suggested that dodos and other animals became mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4,200 years ago. Furthermore, cyanobacteria thrived in the conditions created by the excrements of animals <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> swamp, which died of intoxication, dehydration, trampling, and miring. Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of the swamp, few were found during the 19th century, probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting.|$|E
5|$|In December 1872, Colonel George Crook used Apache scouts {{to find a}} cave in Salt River Canyon {{that was}} being used by Guwevkabaya to mount attacks on White settlers. On December 28, {{accompanied}} by 100 Pima scouts, Captain William Brown led 120 of Crook's men to a siege of the cave. 110 Kwevkepaya were trapped in the cave, when Brown ordered the soldiers to fire at {{the roof of the}} cave, causing rock fragments and lead shrapnel to rain down on the Guwevkabaya. Having nowhere else to go, the besieged <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the cave, where soldiers (accompanied by Crook) pushed boulders onto them from above, killing 76 of the group. The survivors were taken to Camp Grant as prisoners. The Yavapai were so demoralized by this and other actions by Crook that they surrendered at Camp Verde (renamed Fort McDowell), on April 6, 1873. In 1925, a group of Yavapai from the Fort McDowell Reservation, along with a Maricopa County Sheriff, collected the bones from the cave, and interred them at the Fort McDowell cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the game}} was slow to gain popularity. Defender did not attract much {{attention}} at the 1980 AMOA show. In retrospect, Jarvis believed many passersby were intimidated by its complexity. The game, however, was well received in arcades, and crowds <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> cabinet during its first nights of play testing. The success spurred Williams to release a cocktail version as well. Defender eventually became Williams' best selling arcade game, with over 55,000units sold worldwide. By 2004, {{the game was}} a popular collector's item; the upright cabinets were common, while the cocktail models were more rare. Since its release, it {{has become one of}} the highest grossing arcade games ever, earning over US$1billion. Williams employee Larry Demar was surprised at the game's popularity, stating that it was the only game he'd seen able to earn that quantity of quarters. Six months after its release, the game was one of the top earners in the United States video game industry. Mark Stearny of JoyStik magazine called Defender the most successful game in 1981, commenting that it outperformed Pac-Man.|$|E
