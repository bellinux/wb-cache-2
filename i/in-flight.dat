5|$|The U.S. Air Force's first {{operational}} {{deployment of}} the Osprey sent four CV-22s to Mali in November 2008 in support of Exercise Flintlock.

5|$|A {{participant}} in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs, Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1962. He made his first space flight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. He performed the first docking of two spacecraft, with pilot David Scott. This mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster, in the first <b>in-flight</b> space emergency.|$|E
5|$|After {{an hour on}} the ground, the {{helicopters}} left with the first 61 evacuees, including all American civilians and four heads of mission. Evacuees were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm. Complications with the only <b>in-flight</b> refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling, which would have forced {{the helicopters}} to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue. At 9:40, the helicopters arrived on Guam and unloaded the evacuees.|$|E
5|$|An FAA {{study in}} 1968 {{had found that}} {{a quarter of the}} 2,230 {{near-miss}} aircraft encounters reported that year had involved a military aircraft. Following the <b>in-flight</b> collision of Flight 706, the FAA and the US Military agreed to cut down on VFR flights and operate instead under IFR. This transition would require military aircraft to file flight plans and obey civilian air traffic controllers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} eight months of {{operational}} trials, a total of 16 <b>in-flight</b> engine failures and 49 unscheduled engine changes punctuated the ongoing engine dilemma and delayed the in-service date until February 1957, roughly two years late. The Britannia received a fair amount of attention in both the popular press and the British House of Commons, especially when it was revealed that BOAC had contemplated fitting Rolls-Royce Tynes to their fleet of Douglas DC-7s as an interim measure until the Britannia was cleared for service.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Lauda Air Flight 004, {{operated}} by a Boeing 767, crashed after the left engine thrust reverser deployed <b>in-flight</b> for reasons {{that could not be}} determined. The crash of a TAM Airlines Fokker 100 in 1996 was attributed to the deployment of the thrust reverser on No. 2 engine. The aircraft rolled to the right and crashed in a populated area of São Paulo, Brazil.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, the Air Force began a fleet-wide {{technological}} upgrade of its B-52 bombers called Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) {{to modernize}} electronics, communications technology, computing, and avionics {{on the flight}} deck. CONECT upgrades include software and hardware such as new computer servers, modems, radios, data-links, receivers, and digital workstations for the crew. One update is the ARC-210 Warrior beyond-line-of-sight software programmable radio able to transmit voice, data, and information <b>in-flight</b> between B-52s and ground command and control centers, allowing the transmission and reception of data with updated intelligence, mapping, and targeting information; previous <b>in-flight</b> target changes required copying down coordinates. The ARC-210 allows machine-to-machine transfer of data, useful on long-endurance missions where targets may have moved {{before the arrival of}} the B-52. The aircraft will be able to receive information through Link-16. CONECT upgrades will cost $1.1 billion overall and take several years. Funding has been secured for 30 B-52s; the Air Force hopes for 10 CONECT upgrades per year, but the rate has yet to be decided.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fuel and oxidizer systems, the launch vehicle's {{main propulsion system}} is also equipped with a helium system consisting of ten storage tanks in {{addition to}} various regulators, check valves, distribution lines, and control valves. The system is used <b>in-flight</b> to purge the engine and provides pressure for actuating engine valves within the propellant management system and during emergency shutdowns. During entry, on the Space Shuttle, any remaining helium was used to purge the engines during reentry and for repressurization.|$|E
5|$|Intensity of {{precipitation}} is primarily measured for meteorological concerns. However, {{it can be}} of concern to aviation as heavy precipitation can limit visibility. Also, intensity of freezing rain can determine how hazardous it is for pilots to fly nearby certain locations since {{it can be an}} <b>in-flight</b> hazard by depositing ice on the wings of aircraft, which can be detrimental to flight.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{the private}} sector, {{military}} weather forecasters present weather conditions to the war fighter community. Military weather forecasters provide pre-flight and <b>in-flight</b> weather briefs to pilots and provide real time resource protection services for military installations. Naval forecasters cover the waters and ship weather forecasts. The United States Navy provides a special service to both themselves {{and the rest of}} the federal government by issuing forecasts for tropical cyclones across the Pacific and Indian Oceans through their Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|The Fra Mauro {{formation}} (or Fra Mauro Highlands) is a selenological formation on {{the near}} side of Earth's Moon {{that served as the}} landing site for the American Apollo 14 mission in 1971. It is named after the 80-kilometer-diameter crater Fra Mauro, located within it. The formation, as well as Fra Mauro crater, take their names from a 15th-century Italian monk and mapmaker of the same name. Apollo 13 was originally scheduled to land in the Fra Mauro highlands, but was unable due to an <b>in-flight</b> technical failure.|$|E
5|$|The Phantom {{is a large}} fighter with a {{top speed}} of over Mach2.2. It can carry more than 18,000 pounds (8,400kg) of weapons on nine {{external}} hardpoints, including air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground missiles, and various bombs. The F-4, like other interceptors of its time, was designed without an internal cannon. Later models incorporated an M61 Vulcan rotary cannon. Beginning in 1959, it set 15 world records for <b>in-flight</b> performance, including an absolute speed record, and an absolute altitude record.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft, a 7-year old McDonnell Douglas MD-11, {{serial number}} 48448, {{registration}} HB-IWF, was manufactured in 1991 and Swissair was its only operator. It bore {{the title of}} Vaud, in honour of the Swiss canton of the same name. The cabin was configured with 241seats. First and business class seats were equipped with an in-seat <b>in-flight</b> entertainment system. The aircraft was powered by three Pratt & Whitney 4462 turbofan engines and had logged about 36,000 hours before the crash.|$|E
5|$|The {{analysis}} of the satellite communication relies on {{a limited number of}} data points that were analysed using innovative techniques that were only developed after the incident. The analysis has worked to determine useful information about <b>in-flight</b> events and the location of Flight370 at the 08:19MYT signal—believed to have occurred near the time of fuel exhaustion and thus is close to the final location of Flight370.|$|E
