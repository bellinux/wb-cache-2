2500|$|Hines met Louis Armstrong in the poolroom of the Black Musicians' Union, local 208, on State and 39th in Chicago. Hines was 21, Armstrong 24. They {{played the}} union's piano together. Armstrong was astounded by Hines's avant-garde [...] "trumpet-style" [...] piano playing, often using dazzlingly fast octaves so that on none-too-perfect upright pianos (and with no amplification) [...] "they could <b>hear</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> front".

2500|$|Christina Aguilera was {{recorded}} between 1998 and 1999, with Ron Fair {{serving as the}} album's executive producer. The label reportedly spent $1 million on writers, producers and voice lessons. According to Fair, [...] "She {{was very much a}} raw talent, so building a collection of songs that would become her first album was a time-consuming process. We wanted to find the ones that could knock the door down and put her up there." [...] The album was built around pop songs, which was against Aguilera's will, since she wanted a more R album. She further explained during an interview for The Washington Post: [...] "I was held back a lot from doing more R ad-libbing. They clearly wanted to make a fresh-sounding young pop record and that's not always the direction I wanted to go in. Sometimes they didn't get it, didn't want to <b>hear</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> because of my age, and that was a little bit frustrating. Since all the success, it's a little easier to get my opinions across." ...|$|E

My dear, the old lady thinks so high of me that she couldn't abear to see and <b>hear</b> <b>me</b> coming <b>out</b> as a reg'lar brown one. Couldn't abear to make-believe as I meant it!

6000|$|After {{this had}} {{happened}} two or three times, Isuro at last had his eyes opened, and {{made up his mind}} that, whatever Gudu told him, he would do exactly the opposite. However, by this time they had reached the village where dwelt Gudu's future wife, and as they entered Gudu pointed to a clump of bushes, and said to Isuro: 'Whenever I am eating, and you <b>hear</b> <b>me</b> call <b>out</b> that my food has burnt me, run {{as fast as you can}} and gather some of those leaves that they may heal my mouth.' ...|$|R

Tea at the gardener's cottage was a serious meal, with a big cake and little cakes, and {{preserves}} and fruit, a fine spread upon a table. You must imagine me, sullen, awkward, and preoccupied, perplexed by the something that was inexplicably unexpected in Nettie, saying little, and glowering across the cake at her, and all the eloquence I had been concentrating for the previous twenty-four hours, miserably lost somewhere {{in the back of my}} mind. Nettie's father tried to set me talking; he had a liking for my gift of ready speech, for his own ideas came with difficulty, and it pleased and astonished him to <b>hear</b> <b>me</b> pouring <b>out</b> my views. Indeed, over there I was, I think, even more talkative than with Parload, though to the world at large I was a shy young lout.

I worked as a special educator in Title 1, underserved school communities and the experience had immense challenge and beauty built into it. I discovered my city from an entirely new perspective.
