5|$|What {{is known}} of the {{inhabitants}} of Florida after 1566 was recorded by European explorers and settlers. Juan Ponce <b>de</b> <b>León</b> is credited as the first European to have contact with Florida's indigenous people in 1513. Ponce <b>de</b> <b>León</b> met with hostility from tribes {{that may have been}} the Ais and the Tequesta before rounding Cape Sable to meet the Calusa, the largest and most powerful tribe in South Florida. Ponce <b>de</b> <b>León</b> found {{at least one of the}} Calusa fluent in Spanish. The explorer assumed the Spanish-speaker was from Hispaniola, but anthropologists have suggested that communication and trade between Calusa and native people in Cuba and the Florida Keys was common, or that Ponce <b>de</b> <b>León</b> was not the first Spaniard to make contact with the native people of Florida. During his second visit to South Florida, Ponce <b>de</b> <b>León</b> was killed by the Calusa, and the tribe gained a reputation for violence, causing future explorers to avoid them. In the more than 200years the Calusa had relations with the Spanish, they were able to resist their attempts to missionize them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the Spanish missionary Fray Alonso <b>de</b> <b>León</b> {{reported}} that about eighty families in San Mateo Ixtatán {{did not pay}} tribute to the Spanish Crown or attend the Roman Catholic mass. He described the inhabitants as quarrelsome and complained that they had built a pagan shrine in the hills among the ruins of pre-Columbian temples, where they burnt incense and offerings and sacrificed turkeys. He reported that every March they built bonfires around wooden crosses about two leagues from the town and set them on fire. Fray <b>de</b> <b>León</b> informed the colonial authorities that the practices of the natives were such that they were Christian in name only. Eventually, Fray <b>de</b> <b>León</b> was chased out of San Mateo Ixtatán by the locals.|$|E
5|$|With the {{capitulation}} of the K'iche' kingdom, various non-K'iche' peoples under K'iche' dominion also {{submitted to}} the Spanish. This included the Mam inhabitants of the area now within the modern department of San Marcos. Quetzaltenango and San Marcos were placed {{under the command of}} Juan <b>de</b> <b>León</b> y Cardona, who began the reduction of indigenous populations and the foundation of Spanish towns. The towns of San Marcos and San Pedro Sacatepéquez were founded soon after the conquest of western Guatemala. In 1533 Pedro de Alvarado ordered <b>de</b> <b>León</b> y Cardona to explore and conquer the area around the Tacaná, Tajumulco, Lacandón and San Antonio volcanoes; in colonial times this area was referred to as the Province of Tecusitlán and Lacandón. <b>De</b> <b>León</b> marched to a Maya city named Quezalli by his Nahuatl-speaking allies with a force of fifty Spaniards; his Mexican allies also referred to the city by the name Sacatepequez. <b>De</b> <b>León</b> renamed the city as San Pedro Sacatepéquez in honour of his friar, Pedro de Angulo. The Spanish founded a village nearby at Candacuchex in April that year, renaming it as San Marcos.|$|E

5|$|In 1688, the Spanish sent {{three more}} expeditions, two by sea {{and one by}} land. The land expedition, led by Alonso <b>De</b> <b>León,</b> {{discovered}} Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, <b>De</b> <b>León</b> finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including {{a woman who had}} been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied <b>De</b> <b>León</b> conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, , wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location.|$|E

5|$|When Ponce <b>de</b> <b>León</b> {{arrived in}} Puerto Rico, {{he was well}} {{received}} by the Cacique (Tribal chief) Agüeybaná (The Great Sun), chieftain of the island Taino tribes. Besides the conquistadors, {{some of the first}} colonists were farmers and miners in search of gold. In 1508, Ponce <b>de</b> <b>León</b> became the first appointed governor of Puerto Rico, founding the first settlement of Caparra between the modern-day cities of Bayamón and San Juan. After being named Governor, <b>de</b> <b>León</b> and the conquistadors forced the Tainos to work in the mines and to build fortifications; many Tainos {{died as a result of}} cruel treatment during their labor. In 1510, upon Agüeybaná's death, his brother Güeybaná, better known as Agüeybaná II (The Brave), and a group of Tainos led Diego Salcedo, a Spaniard, to a river and drowned him, proving to his people that the white men were not gods. Upon realizing this, Agüeybaná II led his people in the Taino rebellion of 1511, the first rebellion in the island against the better armed Spanish forces. Guarionex, cacique of Utuado, attacked the village of Sotomayor (present day Aguada) and killed eighty of its inhabitants. Cacique Guarionex died during the attack which was considered a Taino victory.|$|E

50|$|After {{the death}} of the {{dictator}} Francisco Franco unleashed the Spanish transition to democracy, there was an upwelling of Castilian-Leonese regionalist, autonomist and nationalist organizations, such as Alianza Regional <b>de</b> Castilla y <b>León</b> (1975), Instituto Regional <b>de</b> Castilla y <b>León</b> (1976) and the Autonomic Nationalist Party of Castile and León (Partido Autonómico Nacionalista <b>de</b> Castilla y <b>León,</b> PANCAL, 1977).

5|$|The {{original}} {{members were}} Kellie Crawford, Kathleen <b>de</b> <b>Leon</b> Jones, Nathan Foley, Tim Harding and Charli Robinson. Four of their albums reached the top10 on the ARIA Albums Chart, It's a Party (No.4, July 2000), Boom Boom Beat (No.3, August 2001), It's a Hi-5 Christmas (No.4, December 2001) and Hi-5 Hits (No.10, July 2003). This line-up {{had been completely}} phased out {{by the end of}} 2008, following <b>de</b> <b>Leon</b> Jones, who left on maternity leave in 2006. The membership has since changed several times. The brand has produced numerous television series, music albums, worldwide tours and merchandise. The appeal of the group overseas has led to international versions. The television series features puppet characters Chatterbox and Jup Jup, who are popular associates of the group and are included in the live stage shows.|$|E
5|$|The viceroy {{approved}} {{the establishment of}} a mission but rejected the idea of presidios, primarily because New Spain was chronically short of funds. On March 26, 1690, Alonso <b>de</b> <b>León</b> set out with 110soldiers and several missionaries. The group stopped first to burn Fort Saint Louis to the ground, and then they proceeded to East Texas. Mission San Francisco de los Tejas was completed near the Hasinai village of Nabedaches in late May, and its first mass was conducted on June 1. The missionaries refused to allow the unruly soldiers to remain near the missions, and when <b>de</b> <b>León</b> returned to Mexico later that year, only 3 of his initial 110soldiers remained to assist the monks. Father Damián Massanet, the priest in charge of the mission, left on June 2 to meet the tribes north of the mission before returning to Mexico to request an additional 14priests and 7lay brothers.|$|E
5|$|<b>De</b> <b>León</b> later rescued L'Archeveque and his {{companion}} Jacques Grollet. On interrogation, the men maintained that over 100 of the French settlers {{had died of}} smallpox, and the others {{had been killed by}} Native Americans. The only people known to have survived the final attack were the Talon children, who had been adopted by the Karankawa. According to the children, the settlement had been attacked around Christmas of 1688, and all the remaining settlers had been killed.|$|E
