40|$|Broadly defined, our {{analysis}} {{is concerned with}} the ways a community organizes its service and development activities in neighborhoods to bring about improvements in the quality of urban life. In this dissertation we propose several analytic and evaluative models which make explicit some of the relationships that exist between budgetary and allocative decisions and their outcomes. Chapter 1 provides background for the research and reviews the literature. ^ In chapter 2 we adapt a framework that is used to derive Leontief-type multipliers from the production accounts in the United Nations system of national economic accounts in order to construct neighborhood and program multipliers of community development activities. We divide expenditures on activities in various neighborhoods into public and private sector components. Based on certain assumptions about fixed proportions in the allocation of neighborhood expenditures by activity categories, a unique mappings is derived that transforms the allocation of public funds to a distribution of total expenditure in the city. The mapping {{takes the form of a}} multiplier in which some private sector activities are stimulated by public activities and these, in turn, stimulate additional private activities, and so forth. A numerical example illustrates the derivation of four multipliers for a city of three neighborhoods and six activities. ^ In chapter 3 we develop a framework for analyzing the opportunity costs associated with community development block grant allocations to neighborhoods, and their effects on the tradeoff relations among various urban outcomes. A linear system of equations is used to show the impacts of community development activities on urban outcomes in different neighborhoods, with allowance made for interneighborhood spillover effects. This is embedded in a linear programming model which minimizes <b>expenditure</b> <b>overrun</b> of neighborhood grants, while seeking to achieve desired improvements in urban outcomes. The model can also be used to identify complementarities among urban outcomes in order to provide guidance for obtaining further improvements in certain dimensions of urban life without recourse to additional spending of public funds. A numerical example illustrates the types of analyses that can be effected with the proposed model. ^ A better knowledge of the attainable relations between social service activities and their outcomes can be obtained by examining the individual facilities where social services are delivered to the public. The underlying premise in our approach is that social service facilities are expected to provide the maximum amount of service for a given level of public and private resources. In chapter 4 we apply a method of analysis that involves measuring the relative productivity of child care centers by comparing their service outputs and resource inputs via an application of data-envelopment procedure to construct a service frontier. We illustrate the measurement of relative efficiency, of input factors productivity, of tradeoffs among service outcomes, and of returns to scale. The efficiency of Community Development Block Grant funded facilities is compared with centers that are funded by other sources in several models of service provision. Chapter 5 concludes with a summary of major results, policy implications, and suggestions for further research. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{framework for}} evaluating substitutions and complementarities among urban outcomes is presented. A solution of a linear-programming problem, entailing the minimization of <b>expenditure</b> <b>overruns</b> above a spatially distributed community development grant, {{is used to}} assay the opportunity cost of grant allocations. This is the second essay on the subject developed {{under the auspices of}} the HUD Community Development Strategies Evaluation Project sponsored by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. The first essay appeared in the previous issue of this journal. ...|$|R

Competitiveness remained strong and the current account deficit narrowed to about Â½ percentage point of GDP. Real export growth decelerated from 12. 7 percent in 2000 to 7. 9 {{percent in the first}} three quarters of 2001.

40|$|This paper assesses Burundi’s 2002 Article IV Consultation and a Request for Post-Conflict Emergency Assistance. Implementation of a Staff-Monitored Program in 2001 was {{hampered}} by continued instability and a consequent holding back of donor support. Fiscal performance weakened {{in the latter}} part of 2001, mainly reflecting <b>expenditure</b> <b>overruns.</b> The external current account deficit also worsened, and the overall balance of payments was financed by a drawdown of official reserves and a buildup of external debt arrears. The program for the remainder of 2002 and the first half of 2003 focuses on key short-term stabilization measures. ...|$|R

40|$|With the 2005 {{reform of}} the Stability and Growth Pact, a {{commitment}} was made to actively consolidate public finances in good times and to use unexpected extra revenues for deficit and debt reduction and not for additional expenditure. Against this background this study provides evidence of a lax implementation of expenditure plans in recent years when revenues were buoyant. Moreover, the infl uence of revenue windfalls on <b>expenditure</b> <b>overruns</b> {{is found to be}} more pronounced in countries that also have not met their medium-term objectives. Thus, first experiences in implementing the provisions of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact after its reform are not encouraging...|$|R
40|$|Using {{real-time}} {{data from the}} annual budgets over the period 1958 - 2009, we explore budgetary planning and implementation in the Netherlands. Three fiscal policy regimes are distinguished. Our key findings are the following. First, plans are on average unbiased, although they are overoptimistic during earlier parts of our sample and overly pessimistic during the later parts of our sample, when revenues are under-projected. Second, general economic conditions {{and the state of}} the public finances are important determinants of both plans and their implementation. Third, this is also the case for political and institutional factors. <b>Expenditure</b> <b>overruns</b> are partly related to political factors, whereas cautious revenue forecasts relate to the institutional setting. Fourth, under the most recent regime of "trend-based budgeting" implementation was strongest relative to planning. In fact, this regime may contain some elements that are useful for designing national fiscal arrangements elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Using {{real-time}} {{data from the}} annual budget over the period 1958 - 2009, we explore the planning and realization of fiscal policy in the Netherlands. Our key findings are the following. First, planned surpluses are on average unbiased, although they are overoptimistic {{during the first half}} of the sample and too pessimistic during the second half of the sample. The latter is the result of cautious real-time revenue estimates by the Dutch Ministry of Finance during this period. Second, real growth projections by the official Dutch forecasting agency are unbiased. This contrasts with the experience of the EU as a whole where biased growth projections represent an important source of fiscal slippage. Third, general economic conditions and the state of the public finances are important determinants of both fiscal plans and their implementation. Fourth, this is also the case for political and institutional factors. <b>Expenditure</b> <b>overruns</b> are partly related to political factors, whereas cautious revenue forecasts relate to the institutional setting. In particular, the most recent regime of the "trendbased budget policy" has worked well for fiscal discipline in the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} the twin deficit {{hypothesis}} is fraught with controversy. Some economists {{argue that there is}} independence between current account deficits and budget deficit while some believe that the relationship exists but the direction of causality is uncertain. While others say there is causality running from budget deficit to current account deficit and vice versa. The majority of economists trained in the Keynesian thinking are in favour of the twin deficits hypothesis while others are against it but in favour of the contrasting theory, the Ricardian equivalence. The Ricardian equivalence hypothesis, argues that the two are independent. The major objective of the paper is to test the applicability of the twin deficits hypothesis to Zimbabwe. This is premised on the argument of persistent budget and current account deficits obtaining in Zimbabwe. The majority of researches done along this line are not in Southern Africa. A Granger representation alongside co-integration analysis is used in the study. The findings indicate that the twin deficit hypothesis holds using Johansen cointegration and Granger causality based on lag two. The public <b>expenditure</b> <b>overruns</b> should be a thing of the past...|$|R
40|$|The {{staff report}} for the 2005 Article IV Consultation on the Central African Republic (CAR) {{highlights}} economic developments and performance. Revenue performance was disappointing, and there were sizable <b>expenditure</b> <b>overruns,</b> particularly on the wage bill. The authorities and IMF staff agreed {{on the importance of}} raising government revenue to ensure that sufficient resources are available for basic government functions. Key reforms will include efforts to combat fraud in customs and improve domestic tax administration through increased controls and verification procedures.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the Republic of Congo’s 2003 Article IV Consultation and a New Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). Performance under IMF-supported programs and recent SMPs was disappointing. Major {{progress has been}} made in consolidating security and peace, and in establishing democratic institutions. The public finances deteriorated in 2002, reflecting a combination of <b>expenditure</b> <b>overruns</b> and a drop in non-oil revenue collection. The drop in non-oil revenue was more pronounced at customs, owing to large-scale fraud and widespread use of ad hoc exemptions. As a result, most targets under the 2002 SMP were missed.
