5|$|Sexual {{dysfunction}} is a stressor in relationships. People {{are often}} as concerned about failing {{to keep a}} partner satisfied as they are about meeting their own sexual needs. In fact, two of the top reasons people with SCI cite <b>for</b> <b>wanting</b> to have sex are for intimacy and to keep a partner. The frequency of sex correlates with {{the desire of the}} uninjured partner.|$|E

Attempts were made to start the project, however little progress was made. In 1971, Yogiji Maharaj died.|$|E
5|$|Bavetta was one {{of three}} referees for the Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Kings and the Lakers.

The NBA has not permitted Bavetta to speak publicly regarding the incident, though The New York Times reported on June 12, 2008 that the FBI is investigating allegations that Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals had been manipulated to further the series to a seventh game. Even the television announcers commented on how obvious it was that the fix was in.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} {{twenty years of}} its existence, the only staged {{performances}} of Parsifal {{took place in the}} Bayreuth Festspielhaus, the venue for which Wagner conceived the work (except eight private performances for Ludwig II at Munich in 1884 and 1885). Wagner had two reasons <b>for</b> <b>wanting</b> to keep Parsifal exclusively for the Bayreuth stage. Firstly, he wanted to prevent it from degenerating into 'mere amusement' for an opera-going public. Only at Bayreuth could his last work be presented in the way envisaged by him – a tradition maintained by his wife, Cosima, long after his death. Secondly, he thought that the opera would provide an income for his family after his death if Bayreuth had the monopoly on its performance.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1847, Detroit {{fought to}} {{maintain}} the Capitol within its jurisdiction, but communities in the growing {{western part of the}} state had many reasons <b>for</b> <b>wanting</b> a move inland, including the need to increase defensibility by moving the state government away from the Canada–US border. Detroit had been occupied during the War of 1812, and the border area of Michigan of less than a mile between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, at the Detroit River continued to be occupied by British troops on both banks. Proponents of moving the capitol also sought to promote settlement and the economy in the interior, as well as making the government more accessible to the people throughout the state.|$|E
5|$|Turner had his {{own reasons}} <b>for</b> <b>wanting</b> Alderson gone, {{following}} the Battle of St-Eloi in April 1916. After British troops had taken a large crater near {{the ruins of the}} Belgian town of St Eloi, a brigade of Turner's division was ordered to hold the gain against German counter-attacks. Due to dreadful management of the Canadian forces by Turner and Brigadier-General Huntly Ketchen, German soldiers overran the crater, causing 1,400 Canadian casualties and retaking the land around the crater, negating the gains made at heavy cost just a few days before. Sir Herbert Plumer, the commander of British 2nd Army who had overall responsibility for the front, demanded Ketchen's immediate dismissal and when Turner claimed that if Ketchen was dismissed he would resign, Alderson sought his dismissal as well. Both officers were supporters of Sam Hughes, who made it clear in no uncertain terms to Commander in Chief Sir Douglas Haig that if Turner went then Haig could no longer rely on Canadian support.|$|E

5|$|Makoto first appears {{when the}} cast is in sixth grade, though is in a {{different}} class. Known as Mako for short, though mostly only to Shuichi, Makoto was also assigned male at birth, but wishes {{to be a girl}} and shares Shuichi's interest in cross-dressing; it is this that spurs Makoto to become Shuichi's closest friend. Due to facial freckles and round glasses, Makoto is not able to appear as cute as Shuichi when wearing feminine clothes. Makoto's primary reason <b>for</b> <b>wanting</b> to be a girl may be due to an attraction to men, something Shuichi cannot relate to; Makoto is a romantic who wants to be in a relationship with a cool, adult man. Makoto is unusually mature and is able to think calmly and objectively while providing advice to friends. Makoto also gets along well with boys and girls of the same age, because of good listening skills; Makoto often becomes an onlooker to {{what is going on in}} other characters' lives. Makoto is an only child whose parents run a bakery.|$|E
5|$|While {{the guests}} search for clues in {{discovering}} the killer's identity, they realise {{that many of}} them had motives <b>for</b> <b>wanting</b> revenge on James Woods. Tom did not take the part of Freddy Krueger in A Nightmare on Elm Street due to James advising him not to, Brian had the pilot of his series messed up by James, and Quagmire lost Cheryl Tiegs due to him, while Consuela the Mexican maid says he molested her nephew, causing him to 'shoot himself in the face'. After reading a notebook belonging to Woods and found in a secret room, Mort Goldman's wife, Muriel, disappears after it is discovered that she was being blackmailed by Woods, causing everyone to suspect her as the culprit. Peter accidentally got Joe knocked out, so organizes the groups, however several of them are separated from each other due to the secret passages. However, Muriel turns up dead soon after by being stabbed in the back with the same knife that killed James, placing suspicion on Priscilla, who also disappeared during the commotion. Jillian's husband, Derek goes to an upper balcony to find a cell phone signal and contact the police, but is soon murdered by the unseen killer with one of Woods's Golden Globe Awards. The guests search everyone's rooms until they locate the bloodstained award and Priscilla's dead body in Tom Tucker's guest room. Tom is thus implicated as the killer and is chased and caught by Peter, Joe, Carl, Dr. Hartman, Quagmire, Seamus, and Mayor Adam West.|$|E
