When asked about this during an interview, actor Oscar Nuñez responded, [...] "No show is 'Jump the Shark'-proof, but there have been other moments on The Office that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>were</b> more 'Jump the Shark' than that."

D'Amato, a backer of Sotomayor to begin with and additionally concerned about being up for re-election that year, helped move Republican leadership. Her nomination had been pending for over a year when Majority Leader Trent Lott scheduled the vote. With complete Democratic support, and support from 25 Republican senators including Judiciary chair Orrin Hatch, Sotomayor was confirmed on October 2, 1998, by a 67–29 vote. She received her commission on October 7. [...] The confirmation experience left Sotomayor somewhat angry; she said shortly afterwards that during the hearings, Republicans had assumed her political beliefs based on her being a Latina: [...] "That series of questions, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>were</b> symbolic of a set of expectations that some people had [...] I must be liberal. It is stereotyping, and stereotyping is perhaps the most insidious of all problems in our society today." ...|$|E

Development had lasted {{over two years}} as Stern, who had final script approval, [...] "rejected every script there was ... they were over the top comedies that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>were</b> dumb, boring and dull". After producer Ivan Reitman got involved with the project, Stern agreed to a script developed by Len Blum and Michael Kalesniko. Filming began in May 1996 with director Betty Thomas, and lasted four months with Stern, Quivers and Norris acting as their younger and current self. The crew travelled to the film set after each radio show and stayed there to shoot on weekends. Stern embarked on an extensive publicity tour to promote the film which included numerous television appearances and magazine interview {{in his attempt to}} appeal to people who were not listeners of his radio show. Private Parts premiered on February 27, 1997 at The Theater at Madison Square Garden; outside the theatre Stern and Rob Zombie performed [...] "The Great American Nightmare", a track they recorded for its soundtrack. The film's wide release followed on March 7, 1997. It topped the US box office in its opening weekend with a gross of $14.6 million, and earned a domestic total of $41.2 million. In 1998, Stern received a Blockbuster Entertainment award for Favorite Male Newcomer and nominations for a Golden Satellite Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture (Comedy) and a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst New Star. The soundtrack, , sold 178,000 copies in its first week of release and entered the Billboard 200 chart in the United States at number one in March 1997, the highest selling debut release for a soundtrack to a feature film. Three months after its release, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping one million copies. Stern also provides vocals on [...] "Tortured Man", a track he recorded with The Dust Brothers.|$|E
