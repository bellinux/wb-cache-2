So if the aether is destroyed or absorbed proportionally {{to the masses}} within the bodies, a stream arises and carries all surrounding bodies into {{the direction of the}} central mass.

25|$|The {{flow speed}} of a fluid can be {{measured}} using a device such as a Venturi meter or an orifice plate, which can be placed into a pipeline to reduce {{the diameter of the}} flow. For a horizontal device, the continuity equation shows that for an <b>incompressible</b> <b>fluid,</b> the reduction in diameter will cause an increase in the fluid flow speed. Subsequently, Bernoulli's principle then shows that there must be a decrease in the pressure in the reduced diameter region. This phenomenon is known as the Venturi effect.|$|E
25|$|In reptiles, {{sound is}} {{transmitted}} to the inner ear by the stapes (stirrup) bone of the middle ear. This is pressed against the oval window, a membrane-covered opening {{on the surface of}} the vestibule. From here, sound waves are conducted through a short perilymphatic duct to a second opening, the round window, which equalizes pressure, allowing the <b>incompressible</b> <b>fluid</b> to move freely. Running parallel with the perilymphatic duct is a separate blind-ending duct, the lagena, filled with endolymph. The lagena is separated from the perilymphatic duct by a basilar membrane, and contains the sensory hair cells that finally translate the vibrations in the fluid into nerve signals. It is attached at one end to the saccule.|$|E

25|$|If {{water is}} not allowed to flow in or out of the soil, the stress path is called an {{undrained}} stress path. During undrained shear, if the particles are surrounded by a nearly <b>incompressible</b> <b>fluid</b> such as water, then the density of the particles cannot change without drainage, but the water pressure and effective stress will change. On the other hand, if the fluids are allowed to freely drain out of the pores, then the pore pressures will remain constant and the test path is called a drained stress path. The soil is free to dilate or contract during shear if the soil is drained. In reality, soil is partially drained, somewhere between the perfectly undrained and drained idealized conditions.|$|E
25|$|A {{liquid is}} a nearly <b>incompressible</b> <b>fluid</b> that {{conforms}} {{to the shape of}} its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, {{it is one of the}} four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena.|$|E

2500|$|All {{of these}} effects are often {{mentioned}} {{in conjunction with}} the term [...] "compressibility", but in a manner of speaking, they are incorrectly used.

2500|$|For flow of gases, to {{determine}} whether to use compressible or <b>incompressible</b> <b>fluid</b> dynamics, the Mach number of the flow is evaluated. As a rough guide, compressible effects can be ignored at Mach numbers below approximately 0.3. [...] For liquids, whether the incompressible assumption is valid depends on the fluid properties (specifically the critical pressure and temperature of the fluid) and the flow conditions (how close to the critical pressure the actual flow pressure becomes).
