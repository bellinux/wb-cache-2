50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, locomotives of classes P 2.I, P 2.II, P 3, P 4 and P 5 were used to haul long-distance trains, some of them also local trains. Local <b>traffic</b> was especially <b>hauled</b> by locomotives of P 1.I, P 1.II, P 1.III and T 1 classes. Freight <b>traffic</b> was <b>hauled</b> by G 2.I, G 2.II, G 4.I, G 4.II and G 5 class locomotives. Class T 3 locomotives <b>hauled</b> <b>traffic</b> between Mannheim and Ludwigshafen.|$|R
50|$|The {{village was}} {{recently}} {{involved in a}} controversy with the trucking industry which uses roads in the village to reduce travel time and bypass tolls on the New York State Thruway. Most of the truck <b>traffic</b> <b>hauls</b> garbage from New York City to a landfill near Seneca Falls, New York. As of 2008, the state government was considering imposing restrictions on truck traffic. In November 2008, truckers staged a massive convoy through the Village during its popular holiday-time Dickens Festival.|$|R
50|$|The incline {{built to}} the design of the W&P's Engineer George Stephenson was {{self-acting}} with the descending <b>traffic</b> <b>hauling</b> up the ascending traffic. The descending coach or wagons was given additional weight by means of a wheeled water butt, which was filled before descending, then drained at the bottom and returned to the top with the next ascending load. The machinery for working the inclined plane was obtained from Robert Stephenson at a cost of £135 14s 6d. The original rope for the incline manufactured by Mr. Henry Simpson was 1,500 yards long and 5.5 inches in circumference.|$|R
5000|$|... 1903 - The Worcester Chamber of Commerce was {{established}} in April, when 65 town and 44 country members were enrolled free of entrance fee. The first AGM was held in September 1904. On that date the total annual import to SA amounted to £35 million. The exports totalled £25 million per annum. The <b>gross</b> <b>traffic</b> receipts for the Railway Companies came to £3 million and the [...] "European" [...] population of the country stood at 1 million.|$|R
50|$|MNA also {{operates}} {{several miles}} of industrial trackage {{in the city}} of Springfield; this segment is disconnected {{from the rest of the}} MNA system and <b>traffic</b> is <b>hauled</b> via BNSF to and from the Aurora interchange.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the closure}} of the {{business}} in the early 1970s, brown coal briquettes were transported from Rheinbraun briquette factory in Weisweiler to Stolberg. This <b>traffic</b> was <b>hauled</b> by class 50 steam locomotives based in Stolberg depot until 1975.|$|R
50|$|From November 2013, {{four more}} stores will open at Dublin Airport's Terminal 1. Eason's, {{currently}} at T1 in Dublin, asked the airport operator to tender {{for a new}} contract one year earlier as the retailer blamed a fall in sales {{on the success of}} Terminal 2 at Dublin, which carried the majority of long <b>haul</b> <b>traffic</b> and long <b>haul</b> passengers tend to spend more on books.|$|R
25|$|Freight {{levels have}} {{returned}} to the level that they were at when the railway had a virtual monopoly, prior to 1983. In 1980 11.8 million tonnes of freight was moved by rail, in 1994 this had decreased to 9.4 million tonnes. By 1999 tonnes carried had increased to 12.9 million tonnes, slightly more than the 1975 peak. In the 2006 – 2007 financial year, 13.7 million tonnes of freight were carried. This equated to 3.96 million net tonne kilometres (or the amount of tonnes of traffic gained in 2008 – 2009 compared to the amount of <b>traffic</b> <b>hauled</b> in the 2006 – 2007 year) in the 2008 – 2009 financial year, about 15% of the total freight market.|$|R
5000|$|The {{decision}} was made to build the base on May 8, 1942. The site was located seven miles north-east of Coffeyville, on a 1,456-acre tract of land which had been purchased by the United States government. Construction, which was accomplished by contract {{under the supervision of the}} U. S. District Engineers, Tulsa, Oklahoma, commenced on 1 June 1942. It had really started before when the county began to improve the road network around the new base to handle the increased truck <b>traffic</b> <b>hauling</b> construction material to the site. The weather didn't cooperate, as the latter part of 1942 was very wet, slowing construction; however, most of the construction was accomplished over the next eight months.|$|R
50|$|The {{new line}} opened on 2 January 1905. The Barry Railway had running powers for mineral {{traffic in the}} upper part of the B&MR network in the Rhymney Valley; other <b>traffic</b> was <b>hauled</b> by the local company and {{exchanged}} at Duffryn Isaf.|$|R
50|$|County Road 595 (CR 595, Co. Rd. 595) is a {{proposed}} primary county road in Marquette County in the US state of Michigan. The road would provide access {{from the northern}} part of the county, near the Eagle Mine in Michigamme Township, to US Highway 41 (US 41) and M-28 in Humboldt Township. The approximately 21.5 mi road would be used primarily for commercial truck <b>traffic</b> <b>hauling</b> rock from the Eagle Mine to a processing facility south of US 41/M-28 in Humboldt Township. At present, such traffic has to use existing county roads which involves passing through the cities of Marquette, Negaunee, and Ishpeming. The northern end would be northeast of the mine in Champion Township at an intersection with the Triple A Road (Co. Rd. AAA).|$|R
50|$|The Chambers Covered Bridge is {{a covered}} bridge located in Cottage Grove, Oregon, United States. It is 78 ft long and spans the Coast Fork Willamette River. It {{was built in}} 1925 to carry rail <b>traffic</b> <b>hauling</b> logs from the Lorane Valley to the J.H. Chambers Mill, a lumber mill which was located on an area between South Highway 99 and the Coast Fork Willamette River. The mill closed in the 1950s after a second fire burned the mill down. The {{railroad}} tracks were removed and the bridge was left. The mill property is now being developed as a housing development called Riverwalk. The Chambers Covered Railroad Bridge is the only remaining fully covered railroad bridge west of the Mississippi River.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Recent {{advances}} in computer {{hardware and software}} technology {{have led to the}} increased use of traffic simulation models. Depending on the required objective of the simulation, models range from microscopic models, which detail the movement of individual vehicles, to macroscopic models that use <b>gross</b> <b>traffic</b> descriptors such as flow. Because of the fine level of detail required in a microscopic model, applications tend towards traffic operations over a relatively small geographical area. Macroscopic models are generally applied over a much larger, system-wide, geographical area and are more useful for transportation planning rather than traffic engineering...|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} section from Paderborn to Büren {{was opened}} on 20 October 1898 {{and the rest}} of the line between Büren and Brilon was completed on 1 April 1901. The line was used by passengers and freight <b>traffic,</b> originally <b>hauled</b> by steam locomotives and later by diesel locomotives. Passenger services were eventually operated with diesel multiple units.|$|R

5000|$|The {{operation}} of freight on the Upper Ruhr Valley Railway long acted {{as an extension}} of the Mid-Germany Connection. This meant that the industry of the Ruhr was connected with supply points to the east. This east-west traffic increasingly fell away after the Second World War and it was used almost entirely for local freight traffic. Today, scheduled freight <b>traffic</b> is <b>hauled</b> by class 294 locomotives. In the early morning hours, two trains operate along the Ruhr valley.|$|R
50|$|The Forth and Clyde Junction Railway was {{incorporated}} by Act of Parliament on 4 August 1853; {{the line was}} to be 30 miles (48 km) in length, and the trunk <b>haul</b> <b>traffic,</b> minerals westbound to the Clyde and manufactured textiles from the Leven dyeworks eastbound, was to be dominant.|$|R
50|$|The Peel Godred {{branch line}} runs from Kildane to the {{aluminium}} works at Peel Godred and connecting with the Culdee Fell Railway at Kirk Machan. Although the line has never featured {{prominently in the}} Railway Series books or the TV series, according to Awdry, the line uses electric locomotives powered from the power station at Peel Godred. Christopher Awdry says in the book Sodor: Reading Between the Lines that goods <b>traffic</b> is <b>hauled</b> by engines similar to the British Rail Class 87 electric locomotive. Passenger trains consist of electric multiple units.|$|R
50|$|The Chillagoe Company {{experienced}} considerable difficulties, undergoing several financial reconstructions. Although {{it was not}} profitable, it nevertheless survived until 1923, and had {{an important}} influence on the mining and railway industries of North Queensland. There is evidence of its operations in the ruined smelter at Chillagoe, and abandoned mine sites at Mungana, Einasleigh, Mount Mulligan and elsewhere. However the railway lines built by the company from the government railhead at Mareeba to Mungana in 1901, and to Forsayth in 1910, have survived in use. When constructed, {{they were part of}} the longest privately owned railway network in Australia, but were incorporated into the Queensland Government rail system in June 1919 when most of the Chillagoe Company's assets were purchased by the Queensland Government. At this time Forsayth railway station became a Queensland Railways station. The Station Master was withdrawn after floods closed the line in early 1927. When the line reopened for rail motor <b>traffic</b> (<b>hauling</b> one or two goods wagons for freight) a Porter in Charge was appointed. This remained the position until the 1990s when the Porter was withdrawn and a local agent appointed to handle the small remaining railway business for QR. The line is now chiefly a tourist attraction running the Savannahlander from Cairns. Queensland Rail subdivided the land and sold the house as a private residence in 1991.|$|R
50|$|It {{is still}} used by freight traffic from Altenkirchen. The {{reactivation}} of passenger services {{on the line}} has been discussed for several years. In 2004, test runs were carried out with a Vectus Verkehrsgesellschaft diesel multiple unit on the Holzbach Valley Railway between Altenkirchen and Raubach. In 2006, the Selters-Raubach line, which had been disused since 1999, was reactivated. Since then Westerwaldbahn (WEBA) has operated freight trains over it together with the Raubach-Altenkirchen section, including to a siding in Neitersen and the Schütz factory in Selters. This <b>traffic</b> is <b>hauled</b> by OnRail DH 1004 diesel locomotives. The section is now owned by WEBA.|$|R
50|$|With {{the closure}} of steel making at Newcastle Steelworks on 30 September 1999 and with the {{remaining}} rail <b>traffic</b> being <b>hauled</b> by National Rail, the last 9 locos in service were placed into store and put up for sale. A number were sold to private buyers for use as shunters. Two were sold to the Manildra Group, two to Junee Railway Workshop, two to Loongana Lime and one to Heggies Bulk Haul, Port Kembla, the latter being resold to the Manildra Group. Two been preserved by the Dorrigo Steam Railway & Museum and four by the Richmond Vale Railway Museum.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} opened in 1903. Goods <b>traffic</b> was <b>hauled</b> by steam {{traction}} until 1964 and thereafter with diesel locomotives. In 1968 passenger services were withdrawn. In 1996 {{it was announced}} that goods traffic was also going to be closed down. However, in cooperation with a local initiative and local politicians, the Rhein-Sieg-Eisenbahn took over the Eichbühl-Lanquaid section from DB Netz on 1 January 2000. Five years later the section from Eggmühl to Eichbühl was added. Since 2001, goods trains have been hauled by a Class MV 9 locomotive built by Orenstein & Koppel, which had been purchased from the Zeil am Main sugar factory.|$|R
2500|$|The Paignton branch {{has been}} {{identified}} as a [...] "fragile route" [...] where the addition of any further loco <b>hauled</b> <b>traffic</b> would {{have a significant impact on}} the residual life of track and/or structures. The three stations on the branch are currently under consideration for the provision of improved facilities but this is dependent on third-party funding being made available.|$|R
50|$|BOAC was {{originally}} reluctant to start regular flights between Bombay and Dubai, fearing {{a lack of}} demand for seats. However, {{by the time the}} asphalt runway of Dubai Airport was constructed in 1965, opening Dubai to both regional and long <b>haul</b> <b>traffic,</b> a number of foreign airlines were competing for landing rights. In 1970 a new airport terminal building was constructed which included Dubai's first duty-free shops.|$|R
50|$|In the Deutsche Reichsbahn period, {{the steam}} depots {{of the old}} Palatine Railway {{continued}} to be used. Locomotives of classes 01, 03, 44 and 64 were added. In addition, locomotives of classes 58.0, 75.0 and 75.4 were operated. These steam locomotives operated between Mannheim and Saarbrücken after the Second World War. In the 1950s, class 01 locomotives hauled fast trains from Trier and class 03 locomotives hauled fast trains from Ludwigshafen and Kaiserslautern. Operations of local traffic was dominated by locomotives of classes 23, 38, 71 and 78 and the operations of goods <b>traffic</b> were <b>hauled</b> by class 44 and 50 locomotives. Among others, classes 93.5-12 and 94.5 were used for shunting.|$|R
50|$|On the Kraich Valley Railway {{freight traffic}} runs to Gochsheim. The local freight siding {{branches}} {{off the line}} about five hundred metres west of the station. Another freight siding exists at Münzesheim Ost. The siding in Unteröwisheim is now closed. Until the conversion to Stadtbahn operations, Oberöwisheim station also had a freight siding, but this has now been removed.The freight <b>traffic</b> is <b>hauled</b> by AVG diesel locomotives 462 and 464, which were built by Maschinenbau Kiel. Locomotive 462 was originally owned by the SWEG and {{was taken over by}} the AVG with its takeover of the line. During the time of the SWEG it had the number of 101 and sometimes it was also hauled passenger trains.|$|R
50|$|With their design, {{size and}} axle loading, they were {{intended}} for mixed <b>traffic</b> duties, <b>hauling</b> both freight and passenger trains. They found regular use primarily on the Waterford-Mallow-Tralee line and also on the Tralee-Newcastle West-Limerick line. Given {{that they were the}} first main group of diesel locos used in Ireland, they proved very successful and quickly gained a reputation for comfort and reliability by contrast to the poor cab conditions and suspension rocking of the Class 113 and the interminable breakdowns of the 001/201. However, during the 1960s many of the secondary lines that they were used on were closed and following the arrival of the 181 Class, the 101s were relegated to goods, permanent way and pilot duties.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the highway}} is not {{generally}} used for long <b>haul</b> <b>traffic,</b> {{the increase in}} coal extraction along the SR-10 corridor has caused the Utah Department of Transportation to push for funding for improvements calling {{it one of the}} most dangerous freight corridors in Utah The northern portion of the highway is loosely paralleled by the Utah Railway that helps service the numerous coal mines along the highway corridor.|$|R
50|$|The NZR X {{class was}} a {{pioneering}} class of eighteen 4-8-2 steam locomotives designed by A. L. Beattie that operated {{on the national}} rail network of New Zealand. In 1908, a heavy and powerful locomotive was required to <b>haul</b> <b>traffic</b> on the newly completed mountainous central section of the North Island Main Trunk Railway, and as a logical progression of the 4-6-2 Q class design, the 4-8-2 wheel arrangement was created for the X class.|$|R
50|$|The class 92 was {{intended}} as a mixed <b>traffic</b> locomotive for <b>hauling</b> both international freight trains and the ill-fated and never introduced Nightstar passenger sleeper trains though the Channel Tunnel. Since introduction the fleet was exclusively allocated to freight, however, in March 2015 six locomotives owned by GB Railfreight have begun passenger operations hauling the Caledonian Sleeper on behalf of Serco between London and Scotland, marking the very first use of the class in commercial passenger service.|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} the Alb Valley Railway {{encouraged}} the Karlsruhe planners in the 1960s to connect the northern surrounding outskirts by a modern tram/stadbahn system as well. For this it negotiated with Deutsche Bundesbahn to use the Hardt Railway (Karlsruhe-Neureut-Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen), sharing with the local goods traffic, and reached an agreement {{at the end of}} the 1970s. After building a connecting line between the tram network and the railway line in 1979 the tram service shared the railway line for 2 km to Neureut, where the few remaining goods trains left the line. In 1986 and 1989 the Stadbahn was extended north to Leopoldshafen and Linkenheim-Hochstetten and to the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, again sharing existing railway tracks. Since the remaining goods <b>traffic</b> was <b>hauled</b> by diesel locomotives, the electrification of the line with the tramway’s 750 V DC system did not cause technical problems.|$|R
5000|$|The Córas Iompair Éireann 113 class {{locomotives}} {{were the}} first mainline diesel locomotives used in Ireland, being built in January 1950 and October 1951 by CIÉ at their Inchicore Works. They were fitted with Sulzer 6LDA28 engines of [...] (uprated to [...] in 1956), with four Metropolitan-Vickers MV157 traction motors. They were of Bo-Bo wheel arrangement, weighed 80 tonnes and had a maximum speed of 90 km/h. They were initially numbered 1100-1101 in the steam locomotive number series (and designated class C2a), but were subsequently renumbered B113-B114 in 1957.They were intended for mixed <b>traffic</b> duties, <b>hauling</b> both freight and passenger trains. When they were first introduced, they were used {{on some of the}} express passenger duties between Dublin and Cork. However, with the arrival of production diesel locomotives (the 001 and 101 Classes) from 1955, these two locomotives were used more for freight work, mostly in the area around Dublin.|$|R
40|$|Human trafficking* {{is one of}} {{the most}} lucrative {{criminal}} enterprises in the world, with illicit profits rivaling those of the global drug and arms trades. A 2014 survey by the International Labour Organization estimated that revenue from human <b>trafficking</b> <b>grosses</b> as much as $ 150 billion annually. Yet, unlike with drugs and weapons, the minimal cost of “purchasing” a human trafficking victim, combined with the fact that the same victim may be sold again and again, makes human trafficking a high-reward, low-risk enterprise...|$|R
50|$|The {{line had}} a total length of 191 km, with {{headquarters}} at Romorantin. It opened in 1901 and remained intact until 1951, when the first closures took place. All <b>traffic</b> was steam <b>hauled</b> until the early 1930s, when Billard railcars were introduced to handle some of the passenger traffic. Steam locomotives were operated until the 1950s. In 1981, the Centre region and SNCF agreed to rebuild the four Verney railcars, and built two new ones. The timetable was reorganised to give better connections with the SNCF. The BA became part of TER in 1987. Freight traffic on the BA ended in 1989.|$|R
5|$|In 1930, an NSB Class Cmb1 diesel {{multiple}} unit was taken into use, {{and the number of}} daily trips increased to four. On days with heavy <b>traffic,</b> it <b>hauled</b> a trailer, which was normally stationed at Sandnes Station. On 10 November 1935, the new Ganddal Station opened, simplifying the stopping at the station. During World War II, the {{multiple unit}}s were disused, and instead the trains were hauled with steam locomotives. From 1 May 1944, the line was converted to standard gauge, and NSB Class 14 multiple units were taken into use, running on wood gas {{until the end of the}} war. In 1945, there were four daily round trips, but at the start of 1946, the number of daily round trips increased to six, and from mid-1946, to ten. From 1947 to 1953, there were eight or nine daily round trips, and from 1953 ten. Class 14 was eventually replaced with NSB Class 86 and NSB Class 87 in 1953. By then, the driving time from Ålgård to Sandnes had been reduced from 38 to 25minutes.|$|R
