25|$|This time, Earnhardt {{was back}} for good, winning six championships {{over the next}} two decades, with crew chiefs Kirk Shelmerdine and Andy Petree, and Goodwrench {{replacing}} Wrangler as the primary sponsor after 1987. In the late 1990s Earnhardt's performance began to slow down, and went through 1997 without a victory. The next year, he won the Daytona 500 after 20 starts, all ending in losses. The year after that one, he was able to score wins at Talladega, as well as cause more controversy, after he spun Terry Labonte out to win a race at Bristol. In 2000, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> finally regaining his old form, winning twice and finishing runner-up to Bobby Labonte in points, and his many fans hoped he was gearing up for his record-breaking 8th championship. However, this was not to be.|$|E

We couldn't figure out why an American Airlines plane would be so low in downtown Manhattan. We sort of expected him to veer off {{and go into the}} Hudson. But he just rose a little bit, his altitude, leveled off, and he was headed straight for the Trade Center. So just before he got to the Trade Center, it seemed as though he gained power. We were just watching this airplane on target for the World Trade Center. All of a sudden, boom! He disappears into the Trade Center." ...|$|E
500|$|Kohli {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Delhi against Tamil Nadu in November 2006, {{at the age}} of 18, and scored 10 in his debut innings. He came into the spotlight in December when he decided to play for his team against Karnataka on the day after his father's death and went on to score 90. He went directly to the funeral after he was dismissed. Delhi captain Mithun Manhas said, [...] "That is an act of great commitment to the team and his innings turned out to be crucial," [...] while coach Chetan Chauhan lauded Kohli's [...] "attitude and determination." [...] His mother noted that [...] "Virat changed a bit after that day. Overnight he became a much more matured person. He took every match seriously. He hated being on the bench. It's as if his life hinged totally on cricket after that day. Now, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> chasing his father's dream which was his own too." [...] He scored a total of 257 runs from 6 matches at an average of 36.71 in that season.|$|E

2500|$|On December 8, 1980, Leibovitz had a {{photo shoot}} with John Lennon for Rolling Stone, and she promised him he would make the cover. She had {{initially}} {{tried to get a}} picture with just Lennon alone, as Rolling Stone wanted, but Lennon insisted that both he and Yoko Ono be on the cover. Leibovitz then tried to re-create something like the kissing scene from the couple's Double Fantasy 1980 album cover, a picture Leibovitz loved, and she had John remove his clothes and curl up next to Yoko on the floor. Leibovitz recalls, [...] "What is interesting is she said she'd take her top off and I said, 'Leave everything on'not really preconceiving the picture at all. Then he curled up next to her and it was very, very strong. You couldn't help but feel that he was cold and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> clinging on to her. I think it was amazing to look at the first Polaroid and they were both very excited. John said, 'You've captured our relationship exactly. Promise me it'll be on the cover.' I {{looked him in the eye}} and we shook on it." [...] Leibovitz was the last person to professionally photograph Lennonhe was shot and killed five hours later.|$|E

5000|$|The {{phrase is}} also {{the origin of the}} name of German carmaker Audi. Founder August Horch had left his {{previous}} company, Motorwagenwerke, after a dispute with partners and founded a new company on 16 July 1909, initially named the August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH. His former partners sued him for trademark infringement, and the German Reichsgericht (Supreme Court) ruled that the Horch brand belonged to his former company. Horch therefore called a meeting with close business friends Paul and Franz Fikentscher, {{to come up with a}} new name for the company. During this meeting, Franz's son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room.

[...] "Horch!" [...] in German means [...] "Hark!" [...] or [...] "hear", which is [...] "Audi" [...] in the singular imperative form of [...] "audire" [...] - [...] "to listen" [...] - in Latin. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting, and the company was registered as Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau in 1910.|$|E
