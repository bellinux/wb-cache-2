2500|$|In 1815, Morey {{patented}} a “revolving” steam engine, described {{at length}} in the American Journal of Science in 1819 by John Sullivan, its purchaser. With {{the exception of}} one harsh initial review predicting that it would barely work – which was rebuffed by Sullivan, it was apparently well received and Sullivan's description appeared in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal along with an introduction praising American steam engine and boat refinements. Instead of a stationary cylinder driving a rod that turns a wheel through a second linkage, it seems that the cylinder is allowed to pivot as the rod moves, which then turns a crank. The cylinder's pivot doubles as a valve that controls the direction and flow of steam according to its position. The claimed advantages of this configuration are lightweight, high-speed operation, <b>durable</b> <b>construction,</b> and low cost. This engine met with some commercial success; recorded applications include tugboats, a glass factory, and a sawmill in the Boston naval yard.

40|$|Although {{cementitious}} {{materials are}} the main construction materials and worldwide produced, {{there is still a}} major concern about their sustainability and durability, especially in terms of conserving resources, reducing wastes, and decreasing the environmental impacts of repair and replacement. In general, cementitious materials are very susceptible to cracking provoked by autogenous shrinkage due to their associated self-desiccation process. The problem is even more critical in concrete with blended cements, including Portland cement with ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS). The current paper evaluates efficiency of superabsorbent polymers (SAP) as internal curing agents; shrinkage reduction in mortars with different levels of cement replacement by GGBS (0, 25, 50, and 75 %) is presented. The study is focused on three types of SAPs with different water absorption/desorption capacities (SAP I: 10 g/g, SAP II: 25 – 30 g/g, and SAP III: 35 g/g in cement paste solution). Tests of consistency, density, air content of fresh mortar, setting times, and autogenous shrinkage are analysed. The results showed that mortars with SAP can significantly reduce autogenous shrinkage for any studied GGBS content in comparison with the reference mortar. The reduction of autogenous shrinkage by SAP may decrease the cracking susceptibility and hence increase the sustainability level of the material for more <b>durable</b> <b>constructions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The area’s natural analogues, vitrifi ed forts, {{combustion}} technology, and vitrifi ed waste {{have been}} reviewed. The {{purpose was to}} identify if investigations of vitrifi ed rock in hill forts might be warranted for assessing the long-term integrity of vitrifi ed waste in natural environments. Wastes that are being vitrifi ed include ash from incineration of domestic waste, contaminated soil and fi ssion products from reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. It was found that vitrifi ed materials in at least 200 hill forts constitute good anthropogenic analogues to vitri-fi ed waste. The compositions vary considerably from site to site and even within one site and may correspond relatively well to the spans of parameters in the various vitrifi ed wastes. Glasses in vitrifi ed forts compare favourably to archaeological artefacts which are soda- and potash-based and consequently have different cor-rosion behaviours and may weather too quickly. Natural glasses might be too limited in composition variation and are perhaps also too durable. Combustion technology considerations based on quality of heat analyses indicate {{that at least some}} of the vitrifi cations of hill forts were carried out with the specifi c purpose of achiev-ing strong and <b>durable</b> <b>constructions.</b> This makes it considerably easier to envisage how the vitrifi cations might have been carried out, and this, in turn, facilitates comparisons between anthropogenic analogues and modern vitrifi ed wastes...|$|R

40|$|To obtain {{sustainable}} highly-durable structures {{with a long}} service life, {{one should}} tackle the problem of cracking in concrete. Not only is it aesthetically unwanted, cracking may also impair the service life of the construction. Therefore, the ingress of water and harmful substances should ideally be avoided and should be independent of manual repair to be reliable. Autogenous healing in strain-hardening cementitious materials in combination with superabsorbent polymers can be a solution. Here, the superabsorbent polymers will swell to several hundred times their own size when making contact with fluids, thus sealing the crack from intruding fluids. Afterwards, the water is provided to the cementitious matrix for autogenous healing. Further hydration and the precipitation of calcium carbonate crystals may hereby close the crack completely. One {{of the most important}} criterions is the crack width control, as only very narrow cracks may close due to autogenous healing. This is achieved by means of incorporated microfibres, leading to bridging action and multiple cracking. In this research, several types of fibres were tested. These include different types of commercially-available polyvinyl alcohol and polypropylene. It was found that some types of synthetic fibres may accelerate the autogenous healing capacity, due to their chemical nature. The type of fibre can hereby promote the nucleation of calcium carbonate crystals {{on the surface of the}} fibre, stitching the crack. This is especially the case with fibres consisting of polar hydroxyl groups. In combination with superabsorbent polymers, this feature was improved substantially as the water was gradually released towards the cementitious matrix, leading to a more abundant amount of crystals at the crack faces. The natural fibres are alternatives for synthetic fibres due to their good mechanical properties, but should be chemically treated to receive multiple cracking and to act as nucleation sites for calcium carbonate. In general, the most ideal material is a strain-hardening cementitious material with polyvinyl alcohol fibres and superabsorbent polymers. This material can close cracks efficiently and may thus lead to more <b>durable</b> <b>constructions...</b>|$|R
