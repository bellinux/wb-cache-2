30|$|The {{question}} generation method {{proposed in}} this paper may have drawbacks due to using question templates. That is, the question templates can be very specific for a special domain as discussed in Sect.  3. We were aware of this problem and tried to define question templates which should be general enough for several discussion domains. For example, the question templates in Table 3 {{can be used to}} generate questions for the discussion topic “charity” by replacing the placeholder: (1) What is charity? (2) What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> mind when you think about charity? (3) What does charity remind you of? These questions are appropriate for helping participants think about the topic when they have to discuss about charity. Whether all question templates are general enough for other discussion topics, this needs to be evaluated and is a part of our future work. Since the goal of our research is to support students during brainstorming argumentation activities, we also intend to conduct an empirical evaluation study for this purpose.|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} a {{theoretical}} model, this research investigated how the socioecological environment of university residence affects making friendship in the latter and students' academic success. The model contain four physical-environmental characteristics (distal variables) : type of university residence (traditional, conventional), the location (outside or in the city center), and percentages of girls and of advantaged students. It also includes three social climate dimensions of university residence: Order and organization, Cohesion, and Open-mindedness (proximal variables, Bennacer, 2005). Making friendship and students' academic success were estimated, respectively, by following items: "Did you get your exams this year?" (No, In catching up, Yes) and "How many friends <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> this residence?" (Five proposed answers, No friends to Many friends). By applying causal path analysis according to estimates maximum likelihood (n = 260 French students), a structural model was obtained on the socioecological determinants of making friendship in residence and of students' academic success. It accounts for 45 % and 81 % of the variance, respectively. Physical-environmental characteristics of university residence act directly on these criteria, and indirectly via the social climate dimensions of this residence which play an important mediating role. Making {{a lot of friends}} in the university residence inhibits students' academic success...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the general practitioner's style of clothing on the patient's level of confidence in that doctor; is vanity a functional attribute for the GP? DESIGN: Experimental comparative study. METHOD: 4 photographic models representing 4 types of GP, namely the older male, younger male, older female and younger female GP, were each photographed dressed in 4 different styles of clothing (business wear, formal, semi-formal and casual). These photos were shown to evaluators with the question 'How much confidence <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> this doctor?' The level of confidence was allocated a score on a numerical scale from 0 (no confidence) to 10 (complete confidence). There were 2 groups of evaluators: patients aged ≥ 65 years and professionals attending a symposium. RESULTS: The clothing style {{had a significant impact on}} the level of confidence in the older and younger male doctor and in the younger female doctor. The assessment by elderly patients (n = 116) differed significantly from the assessment by professionals (n = 59). The professionals had a far more pronounced opinion on style of clothing than the patients did. Business wear and formal clothing generally inspired more confidence than casual clothing. CONCLUSION: A GP's style of clothing affects the patient's initial level of confidence in that doctor. Vanity therefore seems to be a functional attribute for the GP...|$|E

First, we include {{a measure of}} political interest based on the question: How much interest <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> politics? (a lot some, a little, or none). We use a dichotomous measure of political interest which takes the value of 1 if the respondent reports having any interest in politics and 0, otherwise. Second, we evaluate {{the frequency with which}} respondents’ report talking about politics with other people based on the following question: How often do you talk about politics with other people? (daily, a few days a week, a few days a month, rarely, never). Again, we dichotomize the outcome variable and code the value as 1 if respondents report talking about politics at all, and 0 otherwise. We use binary dependent variables in the statistical analysis for ease of interpretation using the DR approach, which is challenging to interpret using categorical dependent variables. However, we also assess the full categories for political interest and political talk as continuous variables and discuss these results in the next section. 6 Finally, we evaluate the role of international migration on opinions of Mexican elections. The survey asks respondents if they agree or disagree that elections in Mexico are free and fair. The dependent variable is a dichotomous variable that takes the value of 1 if respondents agree and 0 if they disagree.|$|E

She first conducted an informal interview with each person, for about an hour. Psychiatrists were asked questions such as “What inspired you to become a psychiatrist?” “What are your interests outside of your job?” “What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> common with your patient?” Patients’ questions included “How is your experience as a patient?” “Can you tell me about your life before you where a patient?” “What {{would you like to do}} when you are out of hospital?” “How would you describe your relationship with your psychiatrist?” After a break, Gemma would draw the individual directly onto copper plate, afterwards asking them to imagine what kind of images and ideas they would like to see in the portrait. This process, resulting in prints in which each person is surrounded by these images and ideas, aimed to move away from traditional written or verbal clinical encounters between patient and doctor towards building an image of the individual formed by what they choose to disclose. For example, “Dr F has a wonderful relationship with her patient (Patient C). Her patient attributes her full recovery to meeting Dr F. When I asked what they had in common she replied “So much!

How many years teaching experience <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> working with students with learning disabilities, emotional and or behavioral disabilities, or cognitive disabilities? 3.

The findings in the 2012 study compared to the 1897 study showed that {{based on the results of}} the study and surveys, I have found the problem of burn out among special educators still occurs much too often. Many of the same factors still cause burn out as my survey answers still showed to be very similar. There is still too much paperwork overload involved in the job, too many students on one caseload for special education teachers, and there is lack of time for special education teachers to complete their job duties. There are positive results that did show true about special educators feeling more support amongst colleges. This is due to weekly meetings, team teaching or co-teaching, professional development, and all around more collaboration...|$|E
