50|$|Amegilla dawsoni is parasitized by the cleptoparasitic Miltogramma rectangularis, or Miltogrammine fly. These flies {{enter the}} brood {{cells of the}} bee, and feed off of the {{provisions}} meant for the developing brood. They enter the brood cells by means of adult female Miltogrammine flies larvipositing on adult female bees. The adult female bees then enter the cells and deposit the parasitic larvae {{in the vicinity of}} their own brood. It has been hypothesized that these parasites, and their proclivity for <b>food</b> <b>theft,</b> have acted as a selective pressure for A. dawsoni to produce smaller males (minors), which require less food, thus explaining the preponderance of minor males despite their reduced sexual fitness. This is unlikely, however, given that the reproductive benefit of producing large males seems to outweigh the losses created by brood parasitization.|$|R

25|$|The {{emergence}} of cooking in early Homo may have created problems of <b>food</b> <b>theft</b> from women while food was being cooked. As a result, females would recruit male partners {{to protect them}} and their resources from others. This concept, known as the theft hypothesis, accommodates an explanation {{as to why the}} labor of cooking is strongly associated with the status of women. Women are forced to gather and cook foods because they will not acquire food otherwise and access to resources is critical for their reproductive success. On the contrary, men do not gather because their physical dominance allows them to scrounge cooked foods from women. Thus, women's foraging and food preparation efforts allow men to participate in the high-risk, high-reward activities of hunting. Females, in turn, become increasingly sexually attractive as a means to exploit male interest in investing in her protection.|$|R
