[...] "It started off really good for us, unfortunately they just got a couple more runs than us and that's the way it goes sometimes. They played a great game. We stuck together 12 deep from the second the buzzer started, to that end buzzer and no one gave up.

During filming of a flying stunt, one of the wires that was tied to Hrithik Roshan broke, causing him to fall 50 feet, though he landed safely on a shop's canopy. Hrithik {{described}} the incident as a [...] "freak accident", stating, [...] "I was skydiving to my death till I fell on a six-feet-long canopy of a shop that was out because of the slight drizzle. The canopy had iron rods. But I missed those rods too. What do I say? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> right word to describe the situation would be jadoo (magic)."

Believe it or not, {{there are still a lot}} of different interpretations that make it uncomfortable some during a ballgame." [...] Less supportive of Oklahoma was Bob Knight, head basketball coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders. [...] Knight had called for Oklahoma to forfeit its basketball game against Tech in 2003, when the Sooners won 69–64 because of two bad timekeeping decisions. The controversial Knight stated [...] "...ad Oklahoma forfeited that game against us like I suggested, they would have gotten far more positive publicity out of that than if they had gone to the Final Four that year.

500|$|Tonight is {{a concept}} album that explores the highs and lows {{associated}} with an evening of debauchery, as stated by a critic on online publication Ventvox. [...] "This album covers all its bases from the initial excitement of the early evening to the numbness of the morning after", writes the reviewer. The line [...] "come on, let's get high" [...] from [...] "Ulysses", the album's first track, reveals this theme. The album has been influenced by non-British music.

[...] The album also has somewhat of an African influence. Alex Kapranos stated in an XFM article that [...] "We're one of these bands that are always gonna sound the same {{no matter what we}} do, but there are other influences there. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> drums are a little different, Paul has been listening to a lot of African stuff so that's gonna come through." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, George Kimball of Rolling Stone magazine said that [...] "The Allman Brothers had many fine moments at the Fillmores, and this live double album (recorded March 12th and 13th of this year) must surely epitomize all of them." [...] Kimball cited the band as [...] "the best damn {{rock and roll}} band this country has produced {{in the past five}} years" [...] and said of comparisons to the Grateful Dead at the time, [...] "The range of their material and the more tenuous fact that they also use two drummers have led to what I suppose are inevitable comparisons to the Dead in its better days."

That is, Garcia (not to bring in John Coltrane) always takes you someplace unexpected on a long solo. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> appeal here is the inevitability of it all." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{families}} of servicemen and servicewomen {{who were killed}} in Iraq reacted angrily to the book, in which Blair does not apologise for the invasion.

Reg Keys, whose son Tom Keys was killed in Iraq in 2003, said that the book was [...] "just crocodile tears from Blair." [...] Keys said, [...] "The tears he claims to have shed are nothing like the tears I and my wife have shed for our son. They are nothing like the tears that tens of thousands of Iraqis have shed for their loved ones. They don't even come close to it. They seem to me like crocodile tears. It is a cynical attempt to sanitise his legacy." [...] A spokesperson for Military Families Against the War said that Blair's expression of regret over the loss of life was [...] "completely meaningless." [...] The spokesperson added, [...] "He has to prove his regret and giving money to charity doesn't come close. He is giving a minuscule amount compared to the cost of war and rehabilitation of injured soldiers. It is laughable." ...|$|E

500|$|The final {{song on the}} record, [...] "Whipping Post," [...] {{was written}} shortly after Allman {{returned}} to Jacksonville. The song came to him shortly before bed, but {{he was unable to}} acquire a pencil and paper to write down his ideas, as there was a child asleep in the room and he could not turn on the lights. Turning to his next best alternative, he struck two kitchen matches (one for light and one, later blown out, as a charcoal writing utensil) and wrote down his lyrics on a bedside ironing board. [...] "Whipping Post" [...] was similar in composition to [...] "Dreams" [...] in its first incarnation, with Oakley later creating the heavy bassline that starts off the track. Duane and Betts take quick solos before the track builds to an [...] "anguished climax," [...] leading to Gregg Allman's solo voice, singing the song's refrain: [...] "Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'." [...] Allman had no idea the intro was written in 11/4 time — [...] "I just saw it as three sets of three, and then two to jump on the next three sets with" [...] — until his brother pointed it out for him. [...] "My brother told me — <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> day I wrote it — he said, 'That's good, man. I didn’t know you understood 11/4.'

500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing.

2500|$|Claudio Sanchez {{released}} an album from his side-project The Prize Fighter Inferno in October 2006 titled My Brother's Blood Machine.

2500|$|The album's closing song, [...] "Blood", {{was written}} and sung by drummer Vince Nudo, {{who is an}} avid vampire mythology enthusiast.

[...] However, she also joined the Sydney Sixers squad for its inaugural WBBL01 season (2015–16). [...] Explaining her choice of WBBL club, she told The Daily Examiner, [...] "Sydney's a great city. The colour of the team helped and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> rest of the squad that we have was the major drawcard to play for the Sixers." [...] In June 2016, Sutherland injured her knee ligaments in a fall; the injury caused her to concentrate on her batting while she was recovering.

2500|$|The album's artwork is {{designed}} by Martin Kvamme, {{who has worked}} with A-ha on previous occasions, both as a band and on solo projects. Stian Andersen, Guy Berryman, Istockphoto and Helge Kvamme supplied photographs for the inner sleeve. Martin Kvamme said the following about the inspiration behind the cover art: [...] "In this case the title helped quite a lot. I know that this is a somehow poetic quote and that they are not necessarily talking about a mountain, but we wanted something majestic and simple. That's also why we made it quite abstract. It's a picture of the mountain Kyrkja (the church) in Jotunheimen, Norway. Inside we have more images of Norwegian nature (in a collage style). But in general <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> inspiration comes from the overall idea (production and songwriting/lyrics), rather than the album title." ...|$|E

He got a real live quality out of us because we were always used to doing drums first and then the bass, and then the guitar and then the vocals at the very end.

2500|$|Sebastian {{said in an}} {{interview}} in late 2009 that the songs for the album originally had a much more organic old school sound, as his US record company had wanted the album to have a similar sound to The Memphis Album. He said he didn't feel that was right for the Australian market, [...] "I ended up with a new record of original songs that didn't have quite the right production, like it all sounded quite old school, it didn't really have a modern edge to it. I ended up going back and reproducing everything which was quite a nightmare. I mean [...] "Like It Like That" [...] for example was really old school, like real drums, real organic, so we reproduced that and we got it to sound a little more modern, in your face <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>the</b> way it is now and we did that with a lot of the tracks so yeah, it was a bit of a nightmare getting to the final product". Sebastian said he felt he was exactly where he wanted to be creatively with this album: [...] "I'm in a really happy place musically, because this is exactly the style of music I want to do and that I've wanted to do for so long. It's not about me changing the world; it's just about fun music - pure and simple. Music is so powerful. It's powerful enough on a personal level, without me trying to change the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{persistent}} account about Camille {{states that}} 23 people held a [...] "hurricane party" [...] {{on the third}} floor of the Richelieu Manor Apartments in Pass Christian, Mississippi, in the path of the eyewall as it made landfall. The high storm surge flooded and destroyed the building, killing all but one person. Who the survivor is, how many party guests there were, and just how far the sole survivor was swept by the storm varies with the retelling. An ABC made-for-TV movie called Hurricane, starring Frank Sutton of Gomer Pyle USMC, Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Will Geer, Martin Milner, and Michael Learned, was loosely based on the supposed hurricane party. However, the site and names were changed to fictitious ones for the movie, as was the name of the hurricane. The television show Quantum Leap carried an episode regarding the parties of Hurricane Camille and the actual hurricane itself. Twenty-three people are known to have stayed in the Richelieu Apartments during the hurricane, eight of whom died. The tale of the lone survivor and the party appears to have originated with survivor Mary Ann Gerlach. Survivor Ben Duckworth has expressed irritation at the story. There was no hurricane party. Duckworth reiterated in 2001. We were exhausted from boarding up windows and helping the police move cars. We were too tired to party. I can’t tell you why that story persists, or why people didn't put two and two together. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> hurricane party makes a good story.|$|E
