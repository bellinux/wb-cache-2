A 3 meter semispan, 1 meter chord wing model using the above airfoil and <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> is under construction and will be tested in the NASA Langley 4 by 7 meter tunnel. This model will have two separate full span leading edge flaps (0. 10 c and 0. 12 c) and one full span trailing edge flap (0. 25 c).

40|$|The <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> of modern-day {{commercial}} airplanes {{are highly}} effective systems providing the required lift during take-off and approach at low flight velocities. State-of-the-art <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> consist of movable control surfaces which when deployed increase <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> performance. Typical devices are slats and fowler flaps which consist of rigid parts supported and driven by complex mechanical systems. To achieve the goals {{defined in the}} “Vision 2020 ”, technologies to consequently reduce drag and airframe noise will be necessary. In this context especially the <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> {{at the leading edge}} are of major interest. Most experts agree that laminarisation is the only technology which has the potential for step changes in drag reduction within a suitable ti-meframe. But this technology requires high quality surfaces and does not comply with conventional <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> devices like slats. Because of the gap which forms between the slat and the main wing the flow is disturbed and causes transition to turbulent flow immediately after the slat gap. Additionally, the construction space in the next generation high aspect ratio wings is limited due to the employ-ment of slim profiles. Furthermore in recent research programs the slat gap is identified {{to be one of the}} most dominant airframe noise sources in take-off and approach. Therefore smart seamless and gapless <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> devices especially at the wings leading edge are a mandatory enabler for futu-re wings of significantly increased aerodynamic efficiency. In the european project SADE and the national project SmartLED gap- and seamless <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> devices for next generation wings are de-signed. The work presented is based on the initial design of an adaptive leading edge device in these projects and focused on the optimization of such a system regarding issues of shape accura-cy in cruise flight as well as in approach and strength requirements...|$|R

The influence of the high lift section on the sizing and economics of a specific energy efficient transport (EET) was clarified using a computerized sizing technique and an existing advanced airplane design data base.

JUMBO 2 D, a multi-block structured viscous code, has been used to make preliminary analysis of the proposed <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> for the RTA.

40|$|Future {{high-lift}} systems must achieve improved aerodynamic {{performance with}} simpler designs that involve fewer elements and reduced maintenance costs. To expeditiously achieve this, reliable CFD design tools are required. The development of useful CFD-based design tools for <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> requires increased attention to unresolved flow physics issues. The {{complex flow field}} over any multi-element airfoil may {{be broken down into}} certain generic component flows which are termed high-lift building block flows. In this report a broad spectrum of key flow field physics issues relevant to the design of improved <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> are considered.

The target of this work {{is to create a}} nonlinear mathematical model, which describes the dynamic behavior of an active high lift aircraft and which provides direct access to the active <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> in order to use it for aircraft control. The main focus lies on the development of a suitable model structure and the design of an aerodynamic derivative model.

Since wing flaps contribute to the environmental noise of an aircraft, an alternate blown <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> without complex mechanical flaps could prove beneficial in reducing the noise of an approaching aircraft. Thus, in this study, a direct comparison of the acoustic characteristics of high lift systems employing a circulation control wing configuration and a conventional wing flapped configuration has been made.

40|$|<b>High</b> <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> are {{indispensable}} but {{complex and}} heavy systems so {{new methods to}} allow lighter and simpler <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> are actively sought after. One of the methods that have already proven {{to be able to}} increase <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> performance is boundary layer suction. In practice however the application of it is uncommon mainly due to the often high power requirements. The objective of the presented project is studying possible BLS systems with minimal requirements, which may then be driven by ‘naturally occurring’ low pressure zones. Influencing the wake with suction was identified as most promising in this respect, more particularly preventing the phenomenon ‘wake burst’ where the wake rapidly expands and dominates the flowfield in such way that it leads to a loss of lift. Simulations were performed with the inviscid-viscid interaction flow solver MSES, adapted for suction. The results showed that the application of suction was very successful to bring the expansion rate of displacement thickness of the wake below 0. 23, which was identified as the critical value above which wake burst is likely. On selected geometries (NLR 7301 and MFFS 026) this leads to an increase in lift of up to 4. 5 %. This is not a significantly better than earlier investigated BLS configurations, but the requirements imposed on the eventual BLS system are much lower, especially when considering the required under pressure.
