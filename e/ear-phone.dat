40|$|A {{noise map}} {{facilitates}} the monitoring of environmental noise pollution {{in urban areas}}. However, state-of-the-art techniques for rendering noise maps in urban areas are expensive and rarely updated, as they rely on population and traffic models rather than on real data. Smart phone based urban sensing can be leveraged to create an open and inexpensive platform for rendering up-to- date noise maps. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and performance evaluation of an end-to-end, context-aware, noise mapping system called <b>Ear-Phone.</b> <b>Ear-Phone</b> investigates the use of different interpolation and regularization methods to address the fundamental problem of recovering the noise map from incomplete and random samples obtained by crowdsourcing data collection. <b>Ear-Phone,</b> implemented on Nokia N 95, N 97 and HP iPAQ, HTC One mobile devices, also addresses the challenge of collecting accurate noise pollution readings at a mobile device. A major challenge of using smart phones as sensors is that even at the same location, the sensor reading may {{vary depending on the}} phone orientation and user context (for example, whether the user is carrying the phone in a bag or holding it in her palm). To address this problem, <b>Ear-Phone</b> leverages context-aware sensing. We develop classifiers to accurately determine the phone sensing context. Upon context discovery, <b>Ear-Phone</b> automatically decides whether to sense or not. <b>Ear-phone</b> also implements in-situ calibration which performs simple calibration that can be carried out without any technical skills whatsoever required on the user's part. Extensive simulations and outdoor experiments demonstrate that <b>Ear-Phone</b> is a feasible platform to assess noise pollution, incurring reasonable system resource consumption at mobile devices and providing high reconstruction accuracy of the noise map...|$|E
40|$|A {{noise map}} {{facilitates}} monitoring of environmental noise pollution in urban areas. It can raise citizen awareness of noise pollution levels, and {{aid in the}} development of mitigation strategies to cope with the adverse effects. However, state-of-the-art techniques for rendering noise maps in urban areas are expensive and rarely updated (months or even years), as they rely on population and traffic models rather than on real data. Participatory urban sensing can be leveraged to create an open and inexpensive platform for rendering up-to-date noise maps. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and performance evaluation of an end-to-end participatory urban noise mapping system called <b>Ear-Phone.</b> <b>Ear-Phone,</b> for the first time, leverages Compressive Sensing to address the fundamental problem of recovering the noise map from incomplete and random samples obtained by crowdsourcing data collection. <b>Ear-Phone,</b> implemented on Nokia N 95 and HP iPAQ mobile devices, also addresses the challenge of collecting accurate noise pollution readings at a mobile device.

We propose a people-centric noise collection system called the <b>Ear-Phone.</b> Due to the voluntary participation of people, {{the number and}} location of samples cannot be guaranteed.

40|$|Anthropometric data {{is needed}} {{in the design of}} {{products}} as it varies between individuals and nations. These data for Nigerians is presently scant and this study is an attempt to provide data on hand, foot and ear for the improvements of hand gloves, handles, shoes, pedal dimensions, <b>ear-phones</b> and other related products. A random sample of 500 students was taken and their ages were between 18 and 29 years (mean of 21. 7 years). Two hundred and fifty of the samples were males and the same numbers were females. The dimensions measured were ▪ hand: length and breadth; ▪ foot: length, breadth and height; ▪ ear: height and breadth. The study presents the anthropometric data for the 5 th, 50 th and 95 th percentiles for the above-presented variables. The study established that foot breadths of the females were larger than those of the males while the males had larger foot lengths. There {{were no significant differences between}} the hand dimensions of the males and those of the females. Similarly, there were no significant differences between the ear dimensions of males and the female...|$|R
40|$|Today, noise {{reduction}} methods are nearly ubiquitous although often not noticed by laymen. Cellular phones, some hands-free headsets and <b>ear-phones</b> offered by some airlines during long haul flights all utilize {{noise reduction}} algorithms. However, {{there are some}} situations in everyday life where ordinary noise reduction algorithms do not suffice; situations where the surrounding noise sound pressure level is too high to be efficiently attenuated by ordinary algorithms. Personal communication is then partly or totally prohibited by this noise. Examples of such situations may be motorcycle riding or attending a concert. In addition, many occupations, foremost industrial work, expose people to very high sound pressure levels. Still, these {{people need to be}} able to communicate safely. This report describes a technique where an ear-mic, i. e. a small microphone for communication purposes, is placed inside the auditory canal where it picks up bone conducted speech from the user's speech organ. The report describes three different approaches and usage areas: First, a basic approach where combination effects of an ear-mic and a pair of Active Noise Control (ANC) equipped ear-muffs are investigated. Second, this approach is used to improve a speech recognition system. The third approach is to connect a well-known noise reduction algorithm - the spectral subtraction - in cascade with the previously described ear-mic/ANC-solution in order to achieve extreme noise suppression...|$|R
40|$|Bats produce {{very low}} {{frequency}} (VLF) radio pulses and display magnetic qualities. Extremely low fre-quency (ELF) radio emissions were observed inside bat caves. Ground return currents from 60 Hz AC power systems run through the ceiling of some bat caves. MATERIALS AND METHODS I developed a metal antenna tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver that could be tuned to the radio electric wave {{to the exclusion of}} a microphone-detected audio wave (Koemel & Callahan, 1994). It is a wide band receiver, but only frequen-cies between 20 Hz and 18, 000 Hz can be heard in the <b>ear-phone.</b> Atmospheric radio emission observations were made in an area not affected by 60 Hz AC power systems. In July, 1993, I began observing extremely low frequency and {{very low frequency}} (ELF) radio emissions in caves and VLF radio pulses produced by flying bats. The pulses pro-duced by bats were observed only during bat flight activity. This article contains preliminary data obtained with the TRF receiver. METHOD OF RECORDING OBSERVATIONS I recorded the observed ELF radio emissions by attaching an electric-shielded patch cable from the TRF receiver <b>ear-phone</b> jack to the microphone input jack of a computer-com-patible cassette tape recorder set in the RECORD mode. This connection prevented the tape recorder from recording sound. I held the TRF receiver motionless while recording ELF radio emissions. I kept my body in contact with the TRF receiver chassis ground, while making observations, to prevent static discharges from “hand capacitance”. COMPUTER ANALYSIS OF EMISSIONS I used a Heath-Zenith digital computer oscilloscop...|$|E
40|$|Earphone-based {{simulation}} of Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) {{is a common}} component of spatial auditory display for virtual sound sources located in virtual environments, but one tech-nical component of HRTF deployment that requires special care has not always received proper attention. The audio signals to {{be presented to the}} listener are not often properly corrected for the response of earphones, and yet such correction has long been re-garded as crucial to the success of spatial sound reproduction using earphones. Two approaches to developing Earphone Correction Filters (ECFs) are contrasted in this paper, one based on the as-sumption that the ECF must be based upon an inversion the user’s individually measured Earphone Transfer Functions, and the other based upon the assumption that a satisfactory result can be at-tained through a general equalization for correcting the tone col-oration imparted by the averaged ETF. The results of these two approaches were perceptually evaluated for a range of stimuli gen-erated by varying the shape of an experimental ECF using a four-alternative, forced-choice (4 AFC) test. Changes in auditory im-agery associated with speech stimuli were easily detected and dis-criminated when comparing reproductions with and without <b>ear-phone</b> correction, but perceptual differences were much more dif-ficult to detect as the shape of the experimental ECF was varied by frequency scaling. Further forced-choice tests showed that ECF frequency scaling factors of 0. 8 and 1. 2 do not result in detectable differences, but factors of 0. 6 or 1. 4 make detectable differences. 1...|$|E
40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) offer a {{promising}} solution {{to monitor the}} physical world around us. Besides the traditional mote-based sensing, the Participatory WSN paradigm allows people to sense their environment using readily available mobile phones, and share this information using existing cellular and Internet communications infrastructure. WSN is promising as it enables applications at affordable cost, which were not previously possible using the wired sensor networks. WSNs provide endless opportunities, {{but at the same}} time pose formidable challenges. One key challenge of WSNs is that the information collected by the wireless sensing applications is typically incomplete. For example, in the traditional WSNs, the amount of usable information is constrained by two key limiting characteristics, 1. limited energy availability to produce samples and 2. communication constraints. In the participatory WSNs, the amount of usable information is constrained by the uncertain availability of samples. Due to this incompleteness of information, it is not possible to &# 147;accurately&# 148; recover a phenomenon using WSNs. In this dissertation, we propose and design systems based on sparse recovery or sparse approximation methods to accurately recover various phenomena using the incomplete information collected by the wireless sensing applications. Due to the high level of temporal-spatial correlations amongst the data collected at the sensor nodes, the signal acquired the signal acquired by the sensor nodes is sparse or compressible. The sparsity or compressibility of the signal motivates us to apply sparse approximation methods, since such methods recover the sparse or compressible signals using significantly small amount of information. In order to validate our proposition, we case study three wireless sensing applications: rainforest monitoring, participatory noise mapping and object tracking. We design three systems: EAST (Energy Aware Sparse approximation Technique), <b>Ear-Phone</b> (End-to-End Participatory Noise Mapping System) and AACAT (Adaptive Algorithm for Compressive Approximation of Trajectory) based on different sparse approximation methods to accurately recover the sensed phenomena using a small amount of information collected by wireless sensing applications: rainforest monitoring, participatory noise mapping and object tracking, respectively. Our analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed systems can accurately recover the phenomena subject to the small amount of information collected by the wireless sensing applications...|$|E
