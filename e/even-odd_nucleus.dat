40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the projection theory of collective motion, a microscopic description of the rotational energy with band-mixing is formulated using a method based on an inverse power perturbation expansion in a quantity related to the expectation value of the operator Jy 2. The reliability of the present formulation is discussed in relation to the difference between the individual wave functions obtained from the variational equations which are established before and after projection. In addition to the various familiar quantities which appear in the phenomenological energy formula, such as the moment of inertia parameter, the decoupling factor and the band-mixing matrix element for |ΔK| = 1, other unfamiliar quantities having the factors with peculiar phases, (- 1) J+ 1 J(J + 1), (- 1) J+ 3 / 2 (J - 1 / 2) (J + 1 / 2) (J + 3 / 2), (- 1) J+ 1 / 2 (J + 1 / 2) J(J + 1), (- 1) J J(J + 1) (J - 1) (J + 2) and [J(J + 1) ] 2 are obtained. The band-mixing term for |ΔK| = 2 is also new. All these quantities are expressed in terms of two-body interactions and expectation values of the operator Jym, where m is an integer, within {{the framework}} of particle-hole formalism. The difference between the moment of inertia of an even-even and a neighbouring <b>even-odd</b> <b>nucleus,</b> as well as the effect of band-mixing on the moment of inertia are studied. All results are put into the forms so as to facilitate comparisons with the corresponding phenomenological terms and also for further application...|$|E

The evaporation residues from this fissile system were selected with the HERCULES detector array and residue-gated gamma rays were measured with Gammasphere. Three band structures of interlinked, alternating-parity levels are observed, two of which are non-yrast. In addition, several high-lying excitations are found. The yrast band is seen up to spin-parity 37 / 2 (-) and 39 / 2 (+), beyond which a high-spin feeding transition is observed.

40|$|A unitary {{description}} for wobbling {{motion in}} even-even and <b>even-odd</b> <b>nuclei</b> is presented. In both cases compact formulas for wobbling frequencies are derived. The {{accuracy of the}} harmonic approximation is studied for the yrast {{as well as for}} the excited bands in the even-even case. Important results for the structure of the wave function and its behavior inside the two wells of the potential energy function corresponding to the Bargmann representation are pointed out. Applications to $^{ 158 }$Er and $^{ 163 }$Lu reveal a very good agreement with available data. Indeed, the yrast energy levels in the even-even case and the first four triaxial super-deformed bands, TSD 1,TSD 2,TSD 3 and TSD 4, are realistically described. Also, the results agree with the data for the E 2 and M 1 intra- as well as inter-band transitions.

40|$|Superfluidity is a {{fascinating}} phenomenon that, at the macroscopic scale, leads to dissipationless flow {{and the emergence of}} vortices. While these macroscopic manifestations of superfluidity are well described by theories that have their origin in Landau's two-fluid model, our microscopic understanding of superfluidity is far from complete. Using analytical and numerical ab initio approaches, this paper determines the superfluid fraction and local superfluid density of small harmonically trapped two-component Fermi gases {{as a function of the}} interaction strength and temperature. At low temperature, we find that the superfluid fraction is, in certain regions of the parameter space, negative. This counterintuitive finding is traced back to the symmetry of the system's ground state wave function, which gives rise to a diverging quantum moment of inertia I_q. Analogous abnormal behavior of I_q has been observed in <b>even-odd</b> <b>nuclei</b> at low temperature. Our predictions can be tested in modern cold atom experiments.

40|$|In {{this report}} we examine two topics {{relating}} to previous work. However {{we feel that}} there are points to be made which we have not made before. A common thread in the two problems is that they both involve the isospin variable in an important way. In a publication by Devi et. al. [1] we calculated the excitation energies of T=Tmin+ 1 states in <b>even-odd</b> <b>nuclei</b> and of T=Tmin+ 2 states of even-even nuclei in the f-p shell where Tmin = |N−Z| 2. We performed a linear fit to these excitation energies E(SA) = b(T + X) E(DA) = 2 b(T + X + 1 2) For a simple interaction of the form a+b t(1) ·t(2), the value of X is unity. We point out that with a simple adjustment we can also convert this to a formula for binding energies and hence obtain a term linear in isospin, which was first found by Wigner.

The onset of two, four and six quasi-particle excitations in the ^ 162 Dy and ^ 172 Yb nuclei is discussed and compared to theory.

40|$|Systematic {{study on}} α-decay fine {{structure}} is presented {{for the first}} time in the case of odd-even nuclei in the range 83 ≤ Z ≤ 101. The model used for the study is the recently proposed Coulomb and proximity potential model for deformed nuclei (CPPMDN), which employs deformed Coulomb potential, deformed two term proximity potential and centrifugal potential. The computed partial half lives, total half lives and branching ratios are compared with experimental data and are in good agreement. The standard deviation of partial half-life is 1. 08 and that for branching ratio is 1. 21. Our formalism is also successful in predicting angular momentum hindered and structure hindered transitions.

Indeed, eigenvalues of the three-dimensional Schroedinger equation will tend to cluster in energy groupings (characterized by specific sets of principal and angular momentum quantum numbers) for any reasonable central potential. In the treatment of complex finite many-body systems, a common simplification is to invoke a ”mean field ” ansatz, replacing the sum of all the two-body interactions by a one-body potential. Generally, such a procedure is only an approximation and various residual interactions need to be incorporated. These will alter the prediction...|$|R
