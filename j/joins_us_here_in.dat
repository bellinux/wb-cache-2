60|$|I must say, however, {{that the}} reason why this decree, or order, {{whichever}} it may be called, has been made, was to the end that men and women, who had large families of children, might be induced to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Jamestown, {{as if we had}} not already mouths enough to feed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I congratulate with England for <b>joining</b> with <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the {{fellowship}} of slavery. It {{is not so}} terrible a thing as you imagine: we have long lived under it: and whenever you are disposed {{to know how to}} behave yourself in your new condition, you need go no further than me for a director. But, because we are resolved to go beyond you, we have transmitted a bill to England, to be returned here, giving the Government and six of the Council power for three years to imprison whom they please for three months, without any trial or examination: and I expect to be among the first of those upon whom this law will be executed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps some of {{the others}} may have got away, and may <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> today or tomorrow. If any are alive, they would be certain to come back here, when they thought the Malays had left." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Austrian armies, and the Russian too, [...] Will show {{nowhere in}} this. The thing that's done, [...] Be it a historied feat or nine days' fizz, [...] Will be done {{long before they}} <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>here.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] it said. [...] "Only one of Maqueda's {{ladies who}} had heard us and come to see who we were. When she learns I expect she will <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> as the girl says she's nervous and can't sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will wait}} {{a minute or two}} before I begin," [...] Hilda said. [...] "I have asked Dr. Leeds to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>here.</b> He has been so very kind {{throughout}} the whole matter that we thought it was only fair that he should be here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} is a fine place, Sam," [...] answered Tom, [...] "and Nellie and I enjoy it {{just as much as}} Dick and Dora do." [...] Tom looked at his younger brother questioningly.

6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} very glad, for I suppose we shall join, {{as he passes}} along. It has been dull work here, and we {{are looking forward to}} gaining our share of the loot. It would be just as well for you to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> now, as to go on to Seringapatam." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The band we saw {{must have}} been joined by another. There are {{certainly}} more than two thousand men there. They will undoubtedly carry the outer palisade. Many of our men will be killed, and many others {{will be unable to}} <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>here.</b> I think that it will be much better to rely on this defence, alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We reached Mota (Sugar Loaf Island) in time {{to leave}} me for a night's visit to the people. I had time before the boat called next day at noon to see five or six of their villages. People quite {{accustomed}} to expect me--all most friendly, apparently pleased {{to be told that}} I would stop with them in the winter. Seven scholars <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>here....</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{certainly}} a good actor, Baron," [...] he declared. [...] "Even your German {{has become a}} little English. Sit down and <b>join</b> <b>us</b> in a glass of beer.

40|$|Last Friday, 26 October, {{marked the}} end of Open Access Week 2012. This {{international}} event, which turned six this year, aims to inform researchers, academics and students about open access and inspire them to share not only this knowledge but also their research outputs. OpenUCT ran several successful events last week, (22 to 26 October) exploring open access and closely tied topics. For those of you who couldn't <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> <b>here's</b> a brief recap of what went on...|$|R
5000|$|Another great {{version of}} the well {{documented}} [...] "The House Carpenter", which has travelled the Atlantic {{and can be found}} both in America and in Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales. This particular version also echoes The Raggle Taggle Gypsy and Cuach Mo Lon Dubh Buí, where the exotic traveller entices a young wife away from her husband to her dismay. Julee Glaub Weem is the source for this unusual version, and she kindly <b>joins</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> on backing vocals along with the great Tim O'Brien exchanging a verse and playing his mandolin.|$|R
5000|$|Vice President-elect Pence, {{we welcome}} {{you and we}} truly thank you for <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> at Hamilton: An American Musical, we really do. We, sir,—we—are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new {{administration}} will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to {{work on behalf of}} all of us. All of us. Again, we truly thank you truly for seeing this show, this wonderful American story told by a diverse group of men and women of different colors, creeds and orientations." ...|$|R
50|$|At Kissimmee US 441 {{separates}} from <b>US</b> 192 and <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 17/92, <b>here</b> {{known as}} the Orange Blossom Trail or OBT. The OBT starts on US 17/92 at the Polk County/Osceola County line a few miles south of Kissimmee. These names are used throughout Central Florida {{for the length of}} US 441 within the region.|$|R
50|$|Winchester {{was long}} the {{transportation}} {{hub of the}} lower Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. Today, US 50 meets Interstate 81 there, as well as US 11, US 522, and State Route 7. <b>U.S.</b> Route 17 <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 50 <b>here</b> from its national northern terminus as the route exits {{the city to the}} east and crosses the Shenandoah River.|$|R
40|$|The Act Out {{event is}} {{organized}} around the work of today’s Nordic women video artists, but in this essay I would like to propose a feminist approach {{to a number of}} video pieces by Portuguese women artists concerning issues related to gender, class and nationality, among other social-political themes, which they have in common with their Nordic counterparts <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> today. There's not a long history of Portuguese video art or a Portuguese women's video art tradition related to feminist issues, like in Northern European countries. However, it's possible to trace features in contemporary Portuguese women video works to the third wave inclusive feminisms, namely the importance of women identities' multiplicity and difference and the complex interrelatedness between codings of gender, race, nationality, language, class, etc...|$|R
6000|$|And {{then the}} waiter came to Mr. Dockwrath. [...] "What's this?" [...] said the attorney, {{taking up the}} bill and looking at it. The whole matter had been {{sufficiently}} explained to him, but nevertheless Mr. Moulder explained it again. [...] "In commercial rooms, sir, as no doubt you must be well aware, seeing that you have done us the honour of <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> the dinner bill is divided equally among all the gentlemen as sit down. It's {{the rule of the}} room, sir. You has what you like, and you calls for what you like, and conwiviality is thereby encouraged. The figure generally comes to five shillings, and you afterwards gives what you like to the waiter. That's about it, ain't it, James?" ...|$|R
5000|$|With Europe devastated, there falls upon <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the United States a {{far greater}} share of the {{responsibility}} for carrying forward, in a creative way, our common Jewish cultural and spiritual heritage...to harmonize heritage and country into a true sense of at-home-ness.|$|R
5000|$|The Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, also mourned his death. [...] "Many of {{you must}} be fans of Facundo Cabral, and {{throughout}} Latin America and <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Colombia. I personally regret this vile murder," [...] Santos said {{at the start of}} a public speech in Bogota.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{absurdity of}} the thing is, {{that we have an}} army in Sicily which might as well be at Jericho, for any use it is. If it <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> it would make all the {{difference}} in the world; though certainly till the campaign opens it would have to be quartered at Lisbon, for it is as much as the wretched transport can do to feed us. Now the truth is, Portugal is a miserably poor country at the best of times, and does not produce enough for the wants of the people. Of course, it has been terribly impoverished by the war. The fields in most places have been untilled and, in fact, the greater portion of the population, as well as our army, has to be fed from England.|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{my faith}} and my troth," [...] quoth Robin at last, drawing a deep breath, [...] "lad, thou art--Thou must not leave our company, Allan!

50|$|Earthstation 5 is at {{war with}} the Motion Picture Association of America(MPAA) and the Record Association of America (RIAA), and to make our point very clear that their {{governing}} laws and policys sic have absolutely no meaning to <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Palestine, we will continue to add even more movies for FREE.|$|R
60|$|In {{old times}} authors {{were proud of}} the {{privilege}} of dedicating their works to Majesty. A right noble custom, which we of Berkshire must revive. For whether we will or no, Majesty is all around <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Berkshire, sitting as in a grand Congress of Vienna of majestical hill-tops, and eternally challenging our homage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Naturally perhaps not," [...] Matteo laughed; [...] "but {{you see it}} {{has become}} a second nature to <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Venice. But seriously I admit that the present state of things has grown to be a scandal, and that the doings of some of our class ought to be put down with a strong hand." ...|$|R

60|$|For Lady Mason let us {{hope that}} the day will come in which she also may once again trick her beams in some modest, unassuming way, and that for her the morning may even yet be sweet with a glad warmth. For <b>us,</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> these pages, it must be {{sufficient}} to say this last kindly farewell.|$|R
6000|$|Wrong as {{we think}} slavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone where it is because that much {{is due to the}} {{necessity}} arising from its actual presence in the nation; but can we, while our votes will prevent it, allow it to spread into the national Territories, and to overrun <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> these free States? ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{the doctors}} had gone she turned to Victor, saying: [...] "There is nothing {{for us to do}} now but to wait.

"Did the Spirits of {{the divine}} Pharaoh your father, and of Mermes my lord, bring <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the Boat of Ra {{that we should be}} devoured by wild animals, like lost sheep in the desert?"

6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{the great}} man said hurriedly, in subdued tones, {{as if the whole}} thing had been a stolen, breathless interview. [...] "Exactly.

60|$|I {{hope that}} your {{asthmatic}} tendencies {{may not be}} strong just now; but Townshend's account of the premature winter at Lausanne is not encouraging, and with <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> England all such disorders have been aggravated this autumn.
