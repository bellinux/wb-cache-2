25|$|When Peter Bogdanovich {{once asked}} him about his religion, Orson Welles gruffly replied that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> his business, then misinformed {{him that he was}} raised Catholic.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the lyrics}} aimed {{at his wife}} Faith, Biggie {{expressed}} an inability to find merit in what Shakur had claimed. He believed that Shakur intended to attack him through Faith, [...] although he remained unsure of whether an encounter between them had occurred. Ultimately, he thought that if something had occurred <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> his business, and that Shakur should not have publicly disclosed this information in a song. Biggie responded to this matter {{in a similar fashion}} to [...] "Hit 'Em Up", rapping in a joint release by himself and Jay-Z in the song [...] "Brooklyn's Finest", where he says [...] "If Faye have twins, she'd probably have two Pacs. Get it? Tupac's?" [...] Shortly after the release of [...] "Hit 'Em Up", Evans went on the radio and denied that she had been with Shakur.|$|E
60|$|A. Oh, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> my business! It wasn't {{any of my}} funeral.|$|E
60|$|I do not inquire at whose door this fraud must lie; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> my business.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't worry, child. <b>It</b> <b>'s</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> our business; {{so we can}} go {{and enjoy}} the music, and if other people flirt, <b>it</b> won't <b>be</b> our fault," [...] said Fanny, impatiently.|$|R
6000|$|... 1. Keep an {{intelligent}} eye upon all the others. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> only {{by doing so}} that you come to see what Art is: Art is the end common to them all, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the points by which they differ.|$|R
60|$|Something was moving, {{that was}} evident, but what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the young hunters could make out. Shep raised his gun again.|$|E
60|$|JAMES. Good-morning, Mr. Cowley. You've seen {{my son and}} myself, you've seen Mr. Cokeson, and you've seen Sweedle, my office-boy. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> us, I take it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it seemed}} to me there was sulphur in the air, so I talked for talking," [...] {{returned}} the other. [...] "But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> it nonsense." ...|$|E
60|$|So Mr. George, {{with an air}} {{and manner}} which seemed to say, <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> my concern, walked {{up a flight of}} steps which led to a sort of {{elevated}} porch or platform before the door of the inn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, it's as to that," [...] I {{instantly}} replied, [...] "you've judged me baffled? I'm afraid," [...] I {{almost as}} quickly added, [...] "that I must admit I have been. Luckily, at all events, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> our business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that-- {{that is out}} of the ordinary." [...] He {{hesitated for}} a moment. [...] "Of course <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> my business, but I am interested. Perhaps I know the party and can help you. May I ask his name?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you but little. He spoke {{to me on the}} subject, but I stopped him. I told him <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> his business, or of mine." ...|$|E
60|$|No {{happiness}} she {{had ever}} known came within miles of it, and some minutes elapsed before she could recall herself sufficiently to reply that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> his business.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Peter, I {{told you}} {{nothing of the}} sort. The meeting with Hester was purely accidental--at least <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> my seeking--and I did not make love to her--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My father,' said I, 'it is {{not easy}} to say who know the Lord; and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> our business. Protestants and Catholics, and even those who worship stones, may know Him and be known by Him; for He has made all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blamed if I {{know who}} that fellow was," [...] he remarked to a crony. [...] "He never told his name, but seems to me I've seen him before. He {{has a kind of}} hang-dog look, I think. But he paid up square and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> my business." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jasper puffed his cigar, {{with his}} eyes on the horizon. 'I don't know whether it's your business, what you are {{attempting}} to discuss; but it really appears to me <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> mine. What have I to do with the tattle with which a pack of old women console themselves for not being sea-sick?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> us," [...] said Patsy. [...] "Miss Stanton--Maud Stanton--swam out to you, {{when she}} noticed you were struggling, and kept you afloat until we--until help came." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am sure, sir, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> my doing, no, nor my {{daughter}} wouldn't neither, only {{the young lady}} over persuaded her. 'Tis she as was the guilty party, as I'll always say.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Strether {{admitted}} it. [...] "Of course I moved among miracles. It was all phantasmagoric. But {{the great}} fact was {{that so much}} of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> my business--as I saw my business. It isn't even now." ...|$|E
6000|$|First, <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> his own {{which is}} of the law, you may be sure; for he hath this righteousness before he doeth any that can be called his own. [...] "He that doeth righteousness is righteous" [...] already, {{precedent}} to, or before he doth that righteousness; yea, he is righteous before, even as HE is righteous.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know you}} are a real friend, Miss Mohun, and never was there any young person who was in greater need <b>of</b> kindness; though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> her fault. She can't help her face, poor dear; and she has never given any occasion, I am sure, but has been as guarded and correct as possible.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes. He {{came to me}} {{yesterday}} {{and said that he}} was sure you had something on your mind. Now, maybe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> our business, Dave. But if I and Roger can help you in any way, you know we’ll be only too glad to do it.” Phil spoke in a low but earnest voice.|$|R
60|$|After all, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> her fault. But {{the thought}} saddened him. It's not catastrophes, murders, deaths, diseases, that age and kill us; it's {{the way people}} look and laugh, and run up the steps of omnibuses.|$|E
6000|$|... "He wouldn't say--leastwise, I didn't ask him, seeing's <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> my business. But he did ask me, {{confidential}} like--after {{he found}} out that I had known your father well--if your folks had any timber lands over in Michigan." ...|$|E
6000|$|Rashleigh had by {{this time}} {{recovered}} his temper completely. [...] "My kinsman," [...] he said, [...] "will acknowledge he forced this quarrel on me. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> my seeking. I am glad we are interrupted before I chastised his forwardness more severely." ...|$|E
5000|$|While Yang never {{formally}} {{provided a}} motive, {{he was quoted}} as saying: [...] "When I killed people I had a desire. This inspired me to kill more. I don't care whether they deserve to live or not. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> my concern...I {{have no desire to}} be part of society. Society is not my concern." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{came to see}} {{you about}} a man who called to see you last night, a Mr. Job Haskers," [...] said Dave, after a pause, during which the {{visitors}} seated themselves. [...] "Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> our business, Mr. Fordham, but my chums and I here felt it our duty to tell you about that man." ...|$|R
5000|$|Russian President Vladimir Putin said: [...] "I {{want to say}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> our {{business}}, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{the business}} {{of the people of the}} UK." [...] Maria Zakharova, the official Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, said: [...] "Russia has nothing to do with Brexit. We are not involved in this process in any way. We don’t have any interest in it." ...|$|R
60|$|Hodder fairly startled these out {{of their}} preconceived notions of Christianity. Let them shake {{out of their}} minds {{everything}} they had thought it to mean, churchgoing, acceptance of creed and dogma, contributive charity, withdrawal from the world, rites and ceremonies: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> these.|$|E
6000|$|Strether's {{theory that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> his {{business}} was somehow not {{damaged by the}} way he took this. [...] "More, you mean, than he?" [...] On which his companion looked round at him, and now for an instant their eyes met. [...] "More than he?" [...] he repeated.|$|E
60|$|A {{perfectly}} plain asbestos fire-curtain descended {{in front}} of the already locked door. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> his business to dispute the drive. If there were any discrepancies between estimate and results, one might be sure that the enemy knew about them, which was the chief thing that mattered.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. I answer, first, <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> his own {{which is}} of the law, you may be sure: for he hath his righteousness before he doth any that can be called his own. [...] "He that doeth righteousness is righteous" [...] already, {{precedent}} to, or before he doth that righteousness; yea, he [...] "is righteous, even as he is righteous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said I to myself, [...] "she {{is doing}} that because she likes <b>it,</b> and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> my business." [...] I gazed over the fields {{on the other side}} of the road, but as I passed her I could not help giving a glance at her machine. The air was gone from the tire of the hind wheel.|$|R
6000|$|The {{light went}} out of the captain's eye. He leaned back on his bench and the little flush in his cheeks was succeeded by a somber coldness. [...] "Very good," [...] said he; [...] "I don't want to hear {{anything}} more about <b>it,</b> and, what <b>is</b> more, <b>it</b> would not <b>be</b> right for you to tell me, even if I did want to know. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> my business." ...|$|R
