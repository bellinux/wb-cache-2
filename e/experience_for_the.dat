5|$|Another {{innovation}} was Boost Mode: a two-player, side-scrolling, arcade-style beat 'em up mode {{not included}} in the arcade version, in which a player fights enemy waves to accumulate items, health and <b>experience.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> Xbox, this mode was adapted for online play with Xbox Live, supporting up to 16 players. Experience points from Boost Mode can be used in the new Robo-Ky II Factory mode, in which a player can customize a robot named Robo-Ky II by teaching him moves, combos, or one of 65 special attacks from other characters. In addition to the attacks, other aspects such as jump height, offense, defense, recovery time, tension, and speed can be improved.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 14, Seltzer met Marion Elizabeth Champlan, and {{the pair}} were married {{when they were both}} 18. Shortly after getting married, Seltzer moved to the Cleveland News to work as a reporter, but was fired shortly thereafter. After a short {{enlistment}} in the Army, Seltzer was hired by the Cleveland Press as a police reporter, and became a city editor in 1916. However, Seltzer felt he lacked the <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> position and resigned after three months, switching to the role of political editor.|$|E

5|$|By {{virtue of}} this variety and his interfusion of Western, Indian folk and Carnatic elements, Ilaiyaraaja's {{compositions}} {{appeal to the}} Indian rural dweller for its rhythmic folk qualities, the Indian classical music enthusiast for the employment of Carnatic Ragas, and the urbanite for its modern, Western-music sound. Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always to match up with the storyline of the running movie and possibly by doing so, he creates the best <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> audience to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score. He mastered this art of blending music to the narration, which very few others managed to adapt themselves over a longer time.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, before Soviet forces {{attempted}} to invade Finland, the Party Secretary of Leningrad Andrei Zhdanov commissioned a celebratory piece from Shostakovich, entitled Suite on Finnish Themes {{to be performed}} as the marching bands of the Red Army would be parading through the Finnish capital Helsinki. The Winter War was a bitter <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Red Army, the parade never happened, and Shostakovich would never lay claim to the authorship of this work. It was not performed until 2001.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Subspecies {{became the}} first American film to be filmed in Bucharest, Romania. Director Ted Nicolaou was {{initially}} apprehensive about shooting on location in Romania, but during a four-day location scout he came to love the location thanks to the free rein he had over the ancient ruins and woodland area. Other Transylvanian areas {{would be used for}} all Subspecies films, with specific location shootings at Hunedoara, Brașov, and Sinaia. Although, the remnants of communism left in the country, along with cultural differences and the general problems that accompany film productions lent to a difficult <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> crew while shooting the first Subspecies film.|$|E

5|$|Shadow of Mordor was Monolith's first third-person open world {{video game}} for the eighth {{generation}} consoles PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and de Plater considered its development an educational <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> studio. In Monolith's introduction to the genre, many core mechanics were built from scratch and the studio were inspired by successful video games such as the Batman: Arkham series created by Rocksteady Studios; those games inspired Shadow of Mordor stealth and free-flow combat mechanics. The studio considered Rocksteady's games good examples of {{how to handle a}} licensed title.|$|E
5|$|While AIB patrols {{continued}} {{to report that}} no Japanese troops were located in the Jacquinot Bay area, the Australian command decided that the landing there would be made by a combat-ready force protected by naval vessels. This was intended both as a precaution against a sudden Japanese offensive and to provide useful <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> units involved. The landing was designated Operation Battleaxe.|$|E
5|$|XX Bomber Command {{conducted}} {{its first}} combat operation on 5June 1944. On this day 98 B-29s were dispatched from bases in India to attack targets in Bangkok, Thailand, as a 'dress rehearsal' for more ambitious operations against Japan and targets in South East Asia. Although little {{damage was done}} and five B-29s were lost due to flying accidents and technical faults, the operation was rated a success by XX Bomber Command as it provided useful combat <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bomber crews as well as data on how the B-29 performed in action.|$|E

5|$|Bradman then {{returned}} {{in the next}} match against Surrey at The Oval in London, winning the toss and electing to bat. The last time Australia had played at the ground was the Fifth Test in 1938, when England declared at a world record score of 7/903; Bradman had hurt his ankle, {{and was unable to}} bat as Australia fell to the largest defeat in Test history. This match was a far different <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Australians. Barnes and Morris put on 136 before Bradman came in to join Barnes; together they added another 207 before Barnes fell for 176. Bradman started slowly and was heckled by the crowd for taking 80 minutes to reach 50, but accelerated and went on to score 146 before being dismissed at 3/403, with Australia proceeding to be all out for 632. He had attacked the medium pacers with his pull shot, but had some difficulties reading the left arm wrist spin of Australian expatriate John McMahon, nearly being caught behind the wicket on multiple occasions. Australia then bowled Surrey out for 141 and 195 to win by an innings.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{preparations}} {{began to}} raise the school leaving age to 16. These were delayed in 1968, and eventually the decision was taken in 1971 that the new upper age limit be enforced from 1 September 1972 onwards. As well as raising the school leaving age in 1972, the year also saw {{the introduction of the}} Education (Work Experience) Act, allowing LEAs to organise work <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> additional final year school students. In some counties around the country, these changes also led to the introduction of middle schools in 1968, where students were kept at primary or junior school for an additional year, meaning that the number of students in secondary schools within these areas remained virtually constant through the change. In others, more radical changes led to middle schools for pupils aged up to 13 opening in smaller secondary school buildings, with other schools accommodating students over 13. As of 2010, there are fewer than 300 middle schools across England, situated in just 22 local education authorities; the number of remaining middle schools has gradually fallen since the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|The 2006–07 {{season was}} a {{learning}} <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> young Arsenal squad and Fàbregas. The club again failed to secure any major honours and were defeated by city rivals Chelsea in the League Cup Final. Fàbregas, however, {{emerged as one}} of the key creative players for the team, playing in every single league game. He kick-started Arsenal's 2006–07 UEFA Champions League campaign when he scored a brace in a 3–0 win over Dinamo Zagreb in a qualifier match. In the Premier League, he notched up 13 assists, which was the second-highest total in the league. He ended the season with several individual honours, including the Golden Boy award, presented by the Italian paper TuttoSport, based on a poll of leading writers across Europe. He was also named in the 2006 UEFA Team of the Year, and named FA Premier League Player of the Month for January 2007. Additionally, he was nominated for both PFA Players' Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year, although both awards went to Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo. In June 2007, he was named Arsenal's Player of the Season, taking in 60% of the votes.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} did {{not give}} the Allies any tactical or strategic advantage; Howard notes that it provided <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> planners in handling deception and for the Twenty Committee in proving the worth of double agents. Terry Crowdy, writing in 2008, argued that any experience that the LCS attained was limited {{by the lack of}} guidance from Cairo and knowledge of double agents. Dudley Clarke had already shown that the most effective method of deception involved the use of agents and faked wireless traffic, rather than major training and troop movements. Hardboiled was the first deception plan aimed at Norway. It led into several others, including Operation Tindall and Operation Solo, culminating in the 1944 Operation Fortitude North, one of the Allies' largest and most successful deceptions.|$|E

When the seal is deactivated, the user is left exhausted, having expended all their energy during its use. The Second Level of the Cursed Seal is achieved by allowing the seal to engulf the users entire body, ultimately causing the person to transform into a personalized parody of Sage Mode with various strengths and weakness. The means to achieve the Second Level is by being given a drug and entering a state of lifelessness.|$|E
