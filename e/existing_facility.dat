25|$|As the {{popularity}} of ice hockey as a spectator sport grew, earlier rinks were replaced by larger rinks. Most of the early indoor ice rinks have been demolished; Montreal's Victoria Rink, built in 1862, was demolished in 1925. Many older rinks succumbed to fire, such as Denman Arena, Dey's Arena, Quebec Skating Rink and Montreal Arena, a hazard of the buildings' wood construction. The Stannus Street Rink in Windsor, Nova Scotia (built in 1897) may be the oldest still in existence; however, {{it is no longer}} used for hockey.

The project included renovation of the <b>existing</b> <b>facility</b> to comply with safety standards and cost $38 million, provided by California's 1988 Proposition 78. The expansion, designed by Gunnar Birkerts, was completed in February 1993. In 1995, La Jolla resident Audrey Geisel donated $20 million to the UCSD Library, supplementing her 1991 donation of $2.3 million worth of her husband Theodor Seuss Geisel's original works.
