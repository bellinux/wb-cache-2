6000|$|... "Oh, that {{is quite}} {{immaterial}} {{so long as you}} only play games of chance; in fact, you don't want to know anything about them. You see others staking their money, some {{on one side of the}} table, and some on the other; you place your money whichever side you like, and take your chance. There is no skill in it. Some people play on what they call a system, but there is nothing in it; you have just as much chance if you put your money down blindfolded. <b>If</b> <b>luck</b> is with you, you win; <b>if</b> <b>luck</b> is against you, you lose." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Some men, you see, with extravagant {{expectations}} of themselves, coolly get them gratified, while others hope rationally and are disappointed. Luck, that's what it is. And the more easily a man takes life the more persistently does <b>luck</b> <b>follow</b> him.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You'd better," [...] said Aunt Liddy, decidedly. [...] "Git {{work and}} stick to it; and, <b>if</b> <b>luck</b> don't come, bread and butter will, and {{in a world of}} woe mebby that's about as much as any one on us ought to expect." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fate control: [...] "...a {{belief that}} life events are {{determined}} by grand external forces, but reassuringly, there are some ways for people to influence {{the impact of these}} forces."

6000|$|... "Tritton, Lindsay, and Holmes {{are going}} to watch with me tonight. I think the best thing will be for you to answer Sanders' note, {{and tell him that}} you will require time to draw your money from England to pay him; but that you will play again tonight, to see <b>if</b> <b>luck</b> turns." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Morley, [...] "you {{have your}} wish already. I am satisfied. I think good <b>luck</b> <b>follows</b> {{me like a}} dog. I am for yonder bright hotel across the square for the night. And what a moon that is {{lighting}} up the city to-night. I think no one enjoys the moonlight and such little things as I do. Well, a good-night to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sunderland is a noted {{place for}} shipbuilding," [...] said Ridley. [...] "Moreover, these come for wool, salt-fish, and our earth coal, and they bring us fine cloth, linen, and stout armour. I {{am glad to}} see yonder Flemish ensign. <b>If</b> <b>luck</b> goes well with us, I shall get a fresh pair of gauntlets for my lord, {{straight}} from Gaunt, the place of gloves." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} crew {{took the}} Susanna to Saint Augustine and joined with Captain Hore (John Hoar) on the pirate ship John and Rebecca. The Susannas ill <b>luck</b> <b>followed</b> them: when Hoar {{and his crew}} called at Baldridges settlement in 1697 to consider retiring, the Malagasay natives began an uprising, {{and a number of}} pirates with their captains - including Hoar and many of his crew (some formerly Wakes) - were killed.|$|R
40|$|Bad <b>luck</b> <b>follows</b> me, Keisha. That’s the thing. I don’t <b>follow</b> bad <b>luck.</b> Bad <b>luck</b> <b>follows</b> me. I don’t {{believe in}} luck. You should. It rules the world. NW, Zadie Smith, p. 275 Hard luck rules {{and so we}} neither deserve {{condemnation}} nor praise for our choices and actions. Although this is the central and deeply revisionary message of Neil Levy’s recent book, he also suggests that the message is not as bleak as it may seem. According to Levy, the hard luck account also ensures {{that there are no}} desert-entail-ing differences between agents and so paves the way for treating everyone fairly and equally (I will have more to say about this in a bit). While the luck objection has been pressed against libertarians for some time (see, e. g. Mele 2006), Levy {{is one of the first}} to develop an account of luck within the free will debate that is systematically employed to undermine a variety of different accounts of free will and moral responsibility, including, libertarianism (Ch. 3) ...|$|R

50|$|Problems on {{the east}} coast {{continued}} to plague Raue as the second event and string of bad <b>luck</b> <b>followed</b> MLRH to England where the event played there was labeled by a team manager and past supporter of MLRH, Michael Payne to be disorganized, chaotic and with the posting of this update, prize monies have yet to be paid. As Payne Stated, Raue simply blew him off. The Pittsburgh event, which has now been rescheduled for the fourth time, remains in the air.|$|R
6000|$|... "Or <b>if</b> <b>luck</b> {{be against}} me, she is {{possibly}} a smart woman, {{that is to}} say, her conversation is a running fire of spiteful remarks {{at the expense of}} every one she knows, and of sneers at the expense of every one she doesn't. I always feel I could make a better woman myself, out of a bottle of vinegar and a penn'orth of mixed pins. Yet it usually takes one about ten minutes to get away from her.|$|R

However, after seven years, things start to change for the worse.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're generous, but it can't be done. Experiences of {{this kind}} are not new to me, and I'm a Jonah, as I warned you. Still, when bad <b>luck</b> <b>follows</b> one everywhere--floods on the Fraser, cattle-sickness, snow coming heavy just when one is finding signs of gold--you know there's no earthly use running away from it, and it's wisest to laugh at fortune and {{stay right where you}} are. Dare say we'll come out on the right side yet; and if we don't, in fifty years it won't make much difference. Now try to look less like guests at a funeral, and talk of {{something}} cheerful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I do mean is this, {{that from}} our love of {{precedent}} and ceremony and old usages, we have retained {{a system which}} contains many of the barbarities of the feudal times, and also many of its lies. We try our culprit {{as we did in}} the old days of the ordeal. <b>If</b> <b>luck</b> will carry him through the hot ploughshares, we let him escape though we know him to be guilty. We give him the advantage of every technicality, and teach him to lie in his own defence, if nature has not sufficiently so taught him already." ...|$|R

50|$|More bad <b>luck</b> <b>follows</b> for Trevor when {{he becomes}} the prime suspect {{for a series of}} thefts at The Queen Vic. Trevor is not guilty and is just unlucky enough to be {{in the wrong place at}} the wrong time. After {{receiving}} a tirade of abuse from Frank and being barred from The Vic, Trevor does some investigating for himself and discovers that the real culprit is Frank's daughter, Janine (Rebecca Michael). After confronting her, she runs away from home in fear. Trevor is beside himself with worry, hysterically blaming himself for the whole ordeal.

5000|$|On 4 March 1992, Pančev {{scored two}} {{beautiful}} goals for Red Star to defeat Panathinaikos 2-0 at the Olympic Stadium in Athens in a European Cup match. The spotlight was on him because upon {{completing the forms}} to gain entry in Greece, he wrote his nationality as Macedonian. This made great havoc among the Greeks, he was detained several hours before being allowed to cross the border. In an interview after the duel he would say, [...] "There is a saying that <b>luck</b> <b>follows</b> the brave. I was happy to score two goals before 80,000 spectators in Athens and Red Star to win 2-0. After that, the earth could open up and I did not mind." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tucker's <b>Luck</b> <b>followed</b> the {{exploits}} of Tucker and his friends, Alan Humphries (George Armstrong) and Tommy Watson (Paul McCarthy), after they had left school and their attempts to find employment and cope {{out there in the}} [...] "real world". Three series were made (although by Series Three, Tommy was gone — his absence explained by his having decided to join the Navy), with several former Grange Hill cast members reprising their roles for the spin-off (such as Linda Slater as Susi MacMahon, Alan's former school girlfriend, in Series One; and Michelle Herbert as Tucker's old class enemy Trisha Yates in the final episode of series three), although the programme never came close to matching the popularity of Grange Hill.|$|R
60|$|His first {{discovery}} was delightful--a wild-dog puppy from the Ysabel bush, being {{taken back to}} Malaita {{by one of the}} Meringe return boys. In age they were the same, but their breeding was different. The wild-dog was what he was, a wild-dog, cringing and sneaking, his ears for ever down, his tail for ever between his legs, for ever apprehending fresh misfortune and ill-treatment to fall on him, for ever fearing and resentful, fending off threatened hurt with lips curling malignantly from his puppy fangs, cringing under a blow, squalling his fear and his pain, and ready always for a treacherous slash <b>if</b> <b>luck</b> and safety favoured.|$|R
60|$|GAYNOR. No, {{your kind}} never realises things till the crash comes--usually when it's too late. She kept on doing her work, I suppose--taking {{care of her}} {{brothers}} and sisters, washing, cooking, sweeping, looking after your comfort--worn out--when {{she should have been}} in bed--and---- (He gets to his feet with a harsh laugh.) But what's the use of talking? The damage is done. We've got to set to work to repair it at once. I'll write to-night to Dr. Stanton of the Hill Farm Sanatorium and find out if he has a vacancy. And <b>if</b> <b>luck</b> is with us we can send her there at once. The sooner the better.|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't it {{a little}} too late for either of us to {{practice}} the somewhat monotonous domestic virtues? You need not be afraid of hurting my feelings, Millicent, by veiling your meaning. But, in the first place, {{at the time you}} transferred your affections to me I had the money, and, in the second, I must either carry out what you call my programme or go down with a crash shortly. <b>If</b> <b>luck</b> favors me the prize I am striving for is, however, worth winning, but things are going most confoundedly badly just now. In fact, I shall be driven into a corner unless you can help me." ...|$|R
