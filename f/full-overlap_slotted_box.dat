40|$|ABSTRACT: Unsteady {{aerodynamic}} {{forces were}} calculated for cross sections such as flat plate, <b>box</b> girder and <b>slotted</b> <b>box</b> girder. Seven methods of CFD were applied. The calculated values were compared with theoretical values or measured values from wind tunnel tests. In {{the case of the}} flat plate and the box girder, the calculated values agree well with the theoretical or measured values. In the case of the <b>slotted</b> <b>box</b> girder, however, the calculated values did not agree well with the measured values. The methods should be improved for them to be applied for <b>slotted</b> <b>box</b> girders...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{feasibility}} study, {{with regards to}} aerodynamic stability, {{about the possibility of}} constructing a suspension bridge with a main span of 3700 m over the Sogne Fjord in Norway. The design wind velocity for the Sogne Bridge is 64. 2 m/s. A preliminary design is conducted to find the approximate dimensions for the bridge models with different cross sections. These bridges are then modeled in Abaqus in order to find the natural frequencies, vibration modes and mass properties. The key to calculating the critical velocity of the models is to include the aerodynamic derivatives of the cross sections. A Matlab program has the aerodynamic derivatives, natural frequencies, vibration modes and mass properties as input. With this information the program is able to calculate the multimode flutter velocity of the models. Also, a response calculation is executed in order to see how the different models behave under serviceability wind velocity. This gives a better picture of which models are most applicable. The results show that to apply a <b>slotted</b> <b>box</b> girder improves the flutter velocity, and all the models with this type of cross-section have a stability limit above the design velocity. For a single box girder, the structural measure of using a mono-cable instead of the traditional two-cable bridge geometry increases the critical wind velocity to above the design velocity. All the models satisfy the serviceability response requirements. </p...|$|R

This paper describes various uncertainty influence quantities that may affect direct voltage-based or correlated E-field radiated emissions tests in most TEM waveguides, and specifically in the GTEM cell. Most TEM-waveguide emissions testing is based on the measurement of EUT total radiated power. To clarify directivity and EUT loading influences, total radiated power and field strengths measured from canonical loop antenna and <b>slotted</b> and raised-lid <b>box</b> EUTs in GTEM cells in the 30 - 2000 MHz frequency range is presented.

The first ball seamlessly blows up a cactus with no apparent issues, and the coyote is eager to try them at work. As luck would have it, the Road Runner is heard, and Wile is quick to lob another ball at him, but just misses, and the ball then drops onto the arm of a cactus, which throws it directly back to its owner. A little agitated, the coyote returns the ball, and this time it is caught by power lines and slung back out of Wile E.'s reach. The ball pops directly back into its original <b>slot</b> in the <b>box</b> of balls as Wile E. arrives on the scene and takes stock.

It was now or never. Putting a strong American inflection into the French which I usually talked with an unmistakable British accent, I catechised the Baron as to the date of the church’s building, its dimensions, and other details which an American tourist would be certain to want to know. Having acquired such information as the Baron was able to impart on short notice, I solemnly placed the two-franc piece in his hand, with the hearty assurance that it was “pour vous,” and turned to go. The Baron was slightly taken aback, but accepted the situation with a good grace.

50|$|In total, twenty-four Tipsy B and Bc {{aircraft}} {{were built}} at Avions Fairey {{before the invasion}} of Belgium by Germany in World War II. About eight had open cockpits (Tipsy B) and the rest were enclosed (Tipsy Bc). The Tipsy {{seems to have been}} mostly nice to fly but, as with other aircraft with pointed wing tips, its low speed behaviour could be unforgiving, dropping a wing at the stall without much warning. During the British production run, some of these issues were addressed.The fourth British aircraft was the first to be modified. To improve the stalling behaviour, it had a strengthened wing with washout at the tips, so that this part of the wing should not stall first, and camber-changing flaps were added to the straight centre section to delay the stall. To meet British airworthiness concerns about control surface flutter, all were mass-balanced. The rudder balance was external, projecting from its leading edge just above the tip of the fin. The elevator was also revised to a single unit with a straight hinge and trailing edge, and the bottom of the rudder slightly cropped to allow it to move. Subsequent British Tipsys included these changes, and from the sixth aircraft onwards also featured fixed letter <b>box</b> <b>slots.</b> In August 1938, during the Certificate of Airworthiness tests at Martlesham Heath, there were concerns about rudder authority, so Tipsy Light Aircraft added 18% to the rudder area, leading to successful certification. At that point, the name of the aircraft changed from Tipsy B to Tipsy Trainer. The ninth aircraft was approved at an increased all up-weight of 1,200 lb (544 kg), and from then on the name was revised to Tipsy Trainer 1.|$|R
