40|$|Published online: 26 Mar 2014 International audienceOne key goal of sewer <b>inspection</b> <b>programmes</b> is {{to target}} {{segments}} {{in the worst}} condition. Despite the development of deterioration models, the influence of available data on models' predictive power has not been studied in depth yet. In this article, numerical experiments have been conducted to answer three main questions: (1) How can the data most probably available within a utility be used to define an effective inspection programme? (2) Can we use an auxiliary variable in order to compensate effects of missing data on <b>inspection</b> <b>programmes?</b> (3) Is it worth to accept a degree of uncertainty within data instead of not having them? In other words, is it preferable to have uncertainty instead of incompleteness within utility database? In order to respond to these questions, we considered an asset stock and then degraded the information by introducing uncertainty, imprecision and incompleteness within, to form a utility's database. The results show that significant improvement of <b>inspection</b> <b>programmes</b> could be achieved by using the most probably available data within utilities. We also show that using the notion of 'district' can provide efficient results when the most informative factor 'age' is not available. Finally, it is shown that having uncertain data is preferable to having incompleteness...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the state-of-the-art of off-line programming (OLP) for co-ordinate measuring machines (CMM's) and explores two {{important aspects of}} OLP systems; automatic generation of <b>inspection</b> <b>programmes,</b> probing points and movements between these, and data transfer from computer aided design (CAD). A method of generating <b>inspection</b> <b>programmes</b> using a 'feature' based definition of component geometry is described. This has been implemented as both free standing code and as a prototype, known as the Inspection Planning Assistant (IPA), which {{is based upon the}} robot simulation software GRASP. Current neutral data exchange formats such as IGES and DMIS are limited in their ability to transfer a toleranced 3 D CAD model to OLP systems. The new standard for the exchange of product model data (STEP ISO 10303) offers the potential to resolve these problems.

40|$|FOREWORD In-service {{inspection}} (ISI) is {{an important}} measure for assurance of equipment integrity and the avoidance of failure and thus a key tool {{in the management of}} nuclear power plant safety and lifetime. Inspection qualification is pursued in most nuclear power countries: the majority of the nuclear power plant operating countries, both developed and developing, have established their qualification infrastructure or {{are in the process of}} establishing it. Considerable experience on technical, organizational, regulatory and economic aspects of inspection qualification has been accumulated. The associated experience with risk informed inspection is rapidly increasing. Risk informed ISI is one of most successful applications of risk informed decision making technology in nuclear power plants. If properly implemented, risk informed in-service <b>inspection</b> <b>programmes</b> can lead to the improvement of plant safety and to the optimization of ISI resources utilization; the latter usually means cost reduction. This TECDOC was prepared within the scope of the IAEA’s programme on Nuclear Power Plant Operating Performance and Life Cycle Management. The publication describes strategies for improving the effectiveness of ISI. The role of in-service inspection in maintaining or improvin...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{contains a}} summary of perceived needs and practices in relation to competency requirements and training programmes for Seveso inspectors of EU Member States and other Seveso countries to support effectiveness of oversight and enforcement of the Seveso Directive on major hazard sites. The information was gathered mainly through a survey of a cross-section of individual Seveso inspectors from various countries and a workshop of representatives of Seveso inspection authorities across Europe. The study found {{that there are no}} standard universally applicable requirements for competency and training of Seveso inspectors. Nonetheless, Seveso <b>inspection</b> <b>programmes</b> generally consider that Seveso inspectors must have some form of basic training and training on the job as a foundation for their work with periodic training to update and diversify their skill sets. This report describes the range of competency requirements, training content and delivery mechanisms offered over the period of study, as experienced by a number of individual Seveso inspectors, and described by inspection authorities of various EU Member States and affiliates.

40|$|Paratuberculosis {{is caused}} by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Calves younger than six months of age are the most {{susceptible}} to MAP infection. Infection is most commonly transmitted by faeces, contaminated milk and faeces-contaminated feed and water. Although eliminating MAP is considered not to begin before 18 months of age, {{it has been shown}} that also young calves can eliminate MAP. Most clinical symptoms (diarrhoea and weight loss) occur between 3 - 6 years of age. The disease ends with the death of the affected animal due to dehydration and cachexia. Subclinically infected adult animals do not show clinical signs of paratuberculosis, but eliminate high quantities of MAP in their faeces. Ziehl-Neelsen staining, cultivation methods, PCR and ELISA test are the most commonly used diagnostic laboratory tests. Paratuberculosis is difficult to diagnose and cure,therefore it is very important to introduce and carry out <b>inspection</b> <b>programmes</b> in MAP positive herds in order to prevent spreading the disease into negative herds.

New Zealand crash data, licensing data and inspection data from the warrant of fitness (WoF) scheme were merged together to evaluate the safety benefits in terms of reduced crash risk and the reductions in safetyrelated vehicle faults associated with the increase from annual to biannual inspections that occur six years after the car’s manufacture date. These were estimated to be respectively 8 % (with 95 % confidence interval 15 % to 0. 4 %) and 13. 5 % (with 95 % CI 12. 8 %- 14. 2 %). The proportion of vehicle faults prevented is likely to be at least maintained over the vehicle age range 7 - 20 years, suggesting that the resultant safety benefit...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and control}} of mycotoxins in feed and food are items {{of great interest to}} researchers, producers, manufacturers and regulatory agencies. In order to implement knowledge of control measures for mycotoxins in the entire food production chain, coordinated <b>inspection</b> <b>programmes</b> aimed to check the presence and concentration of mycotoxins in feedingstuffs are recommended by the Commission of the European Communities. Reliability of measured levels of mycotoxins in feed and food is greatly affected by the collection of representative samples. Because of the heterogeneous distribution of mycotoxins, the variability associated with a mycotoxin test procedure usually depends heavily on the sampling plan. European legislation dealing with sampling plans for mycotoxins in foodstuffs has been recently revised. The aim of the following overview is to discuss the role of sampling in mycotoxin-contaminated feed by considering the evolution of legislation dealing with sampling plans for food. A sampling procedure is a multistage process and consists of three distinct phases: sampling, sample preparation and analysis. The variability associated with each step of a sampling procedure and the aspects related to feedstuffs, matrix/ mycotoxin combination and level of contamination are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Food quality {{problems}} have frequently {{been in the}} news in China leading to growing concerns amongst consumers. Within this context, Geographical Indications (GIs), as an indicator of quality, are becoming increasingly important in the Chinese agrifood market. However, {{in the face of a}} number of GI agrifood scandals reported in the last decade, the effectiveness of contemporary Chinese GI schemes in terms of enhancing agrifood quality is becoming questionable. To discover the underlying reasons for this, the paper first provides an overview of Chinese GI schemes and conceptualises ‘agrifood quality’ using ideas drawn from socio-economic theory and network approaches, with a particular focus on the role of power relationships. It then applies the conceptual framework to case studies examining quality forming processes in three GI networks in Jiangxi Province. The research indicates that the development of Chinese GI networks is driven primarily by the government's intention to increase farmers' and rural incomes, and that the GI schemes examined in this study are characterised by low or basic standards, inappropriate GI issuing procedures and weak government quality <b>inspection</b> <b>programmes.</b> Therefore, the overall conclusion is that the quality of Chinese agrifood products may not be enhanced by GI schemes as currently implemented...|$|E

Supported by European nuclear utilities and managed by the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Petten, the Netherlands, ENIQ was intended to be a network in which the available resources and expertise could be managed at European level. It was also recognised that harmonisation in the field of codes and standards for inspection qualification would furnish major advantages for all parties involved, with the ultimate goal of increasing the safety of European nuclear power plants. More information on the ENIQ network and its activities can be found at [URL] ENIQ¿s work is done by two sub-groups: the Task Group on Qualification (TGQ) focuses on the qualification of in-service inspection (ISI) systems, while Task Group on Risk (TGR) focuses on risk-informed in-service inspection (RI-ISI) issues.
