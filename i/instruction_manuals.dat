5|$|Feth-i Bülend {{was ordered}} in 1867 from the Thames Iron Works, Blackwall Yard in London and was {{laid down in}} May 1868. She was {{launched}} in 1869 and began sea trials in 1870, being commissioned into the Ottoman Navy later that year. Upon completion, Feth-i Bülend and the other ironclads then being built in Britain and France were sent to Crete to assist in stabilizing the island {{in the aftermath of}} the Cretan Revolt of 18661869. During this period, the Ottoman fleet, under Hobart Pasha, remained largely inactive, with training confined to reading translated British <b>instruction</b> <b>manuals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Asar-i Tevfik {{was ordered}} in 1865 by the {{government}} of Egypt as Ibrahimiye and laid down two years later at the French Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée shipyard in La Seyne. The ship was launched in 1868 and completed by 1869 for sea trials. In the meantime, Egypt had transitioned from a state directly ruled by the Ottoman government to the autonomous Khedivate of Egypt, and on 29 August 1868 the Khedivate transferred the ship to the Ottoman Navy. She was commissioned as Asar-i Tevfik in 1870. Upon completion, Asar-i Tevfik and the other ironclads then being built in Britain and France were sent to Crete to assist in stabilizing the island {{in the aftermath of the}} Cretan Revolt of 18661869.

25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war with}} Prussia on 15 July 1870 led to a chaotic mobilization of the French Army. The mitrailleuse batteries faced particularly acute problems. Although on paper they had been organized into proper batteries, at the {{outbreak of}} war the guns were still in storage at Meudon and in the forts of Montrouge, Issy, and Mont-Valerien around Paris. The crews had been designated but {{had not yet been}} assembled. Many had little or no training {{in the use of the}} weapons and so were unaware of its sighting and ranging characteristics. Detailed <b>instruction</b> <b>manuals</b> had been printed in January 1870, but had only been distributed at the very beginning of the hostilities. Such was the secrecy surrounding the weapon that not only did few artillery commanders know how to deploy it effectively, many did not even know that it existed. Marshal MacMahon, commander of the Army of Châlons, claimed that he had never even seen a mitrailleuse until one was wheeled past him at the Battle of Sedan on 2 September 1870, nearly two months after war had been declared.|$|E

The master thesis is based on action research studies with the goal to determine design parameters in how a driver can be supported with an electrical <b>instructions</b> <b>manual.</b> A prototype for Context-Aware Driver Information (CADI) was developed for supporting drivers in car maintenance. CADI is a context-aware mobile <b>instruction</b> <b>manual,</b> executed on a PocketPC.

500|$|During {{his time}} in the office, Arrington {{sponsored}} authors to write academic LDS Church histories. Among the best known works from this [...] "New Mormon History" [...] were two general Church histories, one aimed at LDS Church members, The Story of the Latter-day Saints, and one for interested outsiders, The Mormon Experience: A History of the Latter-day Saints. Arrington also granted liberal access to church archival material to both Mormon and non-Mormon scholars. Arrington continued to professionalize the archives with the systematic cataloging started by Joseph Fielding Smith. This era is sometimes referred to as [...] "Camelot" [...] due to its open and idealistic ethos. The division's output was not subject to the LDS Church's Correlation Program. The Correlation Program edited officially published church materials, like <b>instruction</b> <b>manuals</b> and magazines, to ensure that they presented a consistent message that LDS Church authorities agreed on. Arrington, Bitton, Allen, and Maureen Beecher served as a reading committee for the division's writings in place of formal Correlation approval. Arrington wanted to avoid the Correlation Program, stating that [...] "I do not think we could determine the truth of what had happened in history by having the Quorum of the Twelve vote on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Within a year {{of moving}} to Manchester, Brady was caught with a sack full of lead seals he had stolen {{and was trying to}} smuggle out of the market. He was sent to Strangeways for three months. Because he was still under 18, he was sentenced to two years in borstal for [...] "training". He was sent to Latchmere House in London, and then Hatfield borstal in the West Riding of Yorkshire. After being {{discovered}} drunk on alcohol he had brewed he was moved to the much tougher unit at Hull. Released on 14 November 1957, Brady returned to Manchester, where he took a labouring job, which he hated, and was dismissed from another job in a brewery. Deciding to [...] "better himself", he obtained a set of <b>instruction</b> <b>manuals</b> on book-keeping from a local public library, with which he [...] "astonished" [...] his parents by studying alone in his room for hours. In January 1959, Brady applied for and was offered a clerical job at Millwards, a wholesale chemical distribution company based in Gorton. He was regarded by his colleagues as a quiet, punctual, but short-tempered young man. He read books including Teach Yourself German and Mein Kampf, as well as works on Nazi atrocities. He rode a Tiger Cub motorcycle, which he used to visit the Pennines.|$|E
