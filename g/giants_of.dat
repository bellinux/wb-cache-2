5|$|At {{least four}} of the fifteen stars visible to the unaided eye are orange <b>giants</b> <b>of</b> {{spectral}} class K. The second brightest star in the constellation—at apparent magnitude 4.1—is Zeta Telescopii, an orange subgiant of spectral type K1III-IV.

5|$|Earlier in {{the season}} Commissioner Bud Selig {{expressed}} interest in scheduling a World Series game during daylight hours instead of the evening.

The Philadelphia Eagles and New York <b>Giants</b> <b>of</b> the National Football League (NFL) played across the street from Citizens Bank Park at Lincoln Financial Field on the day of Game4.

Similarly, Game5 was played at Citizens Bank Park on the same day as the Philadelphia Flyers hosted the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL) at the Wachovia Center. The opening faceoff of the hockey game was scheduled for 7p.m. but the NHL moved it to 5p.m. to avoid conflict.|$|E
