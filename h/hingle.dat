In 1951, she moved to Austin, Texas, with her husband, and studied dramatics at the University of Texas at Austin, until her junior year. There {{she worked as a}} nude model for art classes, sold books door to door, and worked as a receptionist of a dance studio. She also joined the Curtain Club, a popular campus theatrical society that featured Tom Jones, Harvey Schmidt, Rip Torn, and Pat <b>Hingle</b> among its members of that time.|$|E

40|$|In 1987, Florida {{anticipated}} the federal Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Program with Project Independence, a statewide welfare-to-work program. It was structured to increase employment among Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) recipients {{as quickly as}} possible, primarily through job search activities. An evaluation was begun in 9 counties randomly selected from among the state's 25 largest in terms of AFDC caseloads; the research sample consisted of more than 18, 000 <b>',ingle</b> parents. The organizational capacity of local programs differed in several important dimensions, including number and characteristics of staff, caseload sizes, service availability and quality, and child care availability.

25|$|The Jolson Story {{had been}} a huge hit in the United Kingdom, and Garrett and husband Larry Parks decided to {{capitalize}} on its popularity by appearing at the London Palladium and then touring the UK with their nightclub act. Its success prompted them {{to return to the}} country three times but the increasing popularity of television eventually led to the decline of music hall entertainment. Garrett was then cast opposite Janet Leigh and Jack Lemmon in My Sister Eileen, a 1955 musical remake of a 1942 film starring Rosalind Russell, when Judy Holliday dropped out of the project due to a contract dispute. The following year she and Parks replaced Holliday and Sydney Chaplin in the Broadway production of Bells Are Ringing during their vacation from the show. Over the next two decades she worked sporadically, appearing on Broadway in two short-lived plays (Beg, Borrow or Steal with Parks and A Girl Could Get Lucky with Pat <b>Hingle)</b> and a musical adaptation of Spoon River Anthology, and making guest appearances on The Dinah Shore Chevy Show, The Lloyd Bridges Show, and The Fugitive.|$|E

500|$|In 1977, he {{directed}} {{and starred in}} The Gauntlet opposite Locke, Pat <b>Hingle,</b> William Prince, Bill McKinney, and Mara Corday. Eastwood portrays a down-and-out cop assigned to escort a prostitute from Las Vegas to Phoenix to testify against the mob. Although a moderate hit with the viewing public, critics had mixed feelings about the film, with many believing it was overly violent. Ebert, in contrast, gave the film three stars and called it [...] "...classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny." [...] The following year, he starred in Every Which Way But Loose in an uncharacteristic offbeat comedy role. He played Philo Beddoe, a trucker and brawler who roams the American West searching for a lost love (Locke) accompanied by his brother (played by Geoffrey Lewis) and an orangutan called Clyde. The film proved surprisingly successful upon its release and became Eastwood's most commercially successful film up to that time. Panned by critics, it ranked high among the box office successes of his career and was the second-highest-grossing film of 1978.|$|E
500|$|Stardom {{brought more}} roles for Eastwood. He signed {{to star in}} the American revisionist western Hang 'Em High (1968), {{featured}} alongside Inger Stevens, Pat <b>Hingle,</b> Dennis Hopper, Ed Begley, Alan Hale, Ben Johnson, Bruce Dern, and James MacArthur, playing a man who takes up a Marshal's badge and seeks revenge as a lawman after being lynched by vigilantes and left for dead. The film earned Eastwood a fee of $400,000 and 25percent of its net box-office takings. Using money earned from the Dollars trilogy, accountant and Eastwood advisor Irving Leonard helped establish Eastwood's own production company, Malpaso Productions, named after Malpaso Creek on Eastwood's property in Monterey County, California. Leonard arranged for Hang 'Em High to be a joint production with United Artists; {{when it opened in}} July 1968, it had the largest opening weekend in United Artists' history. Hang 'Em High was widely praised by critics, including Archer Winsten of the New York Post, who described it as, [...] "a western of quality, courage, danger and excitement." ...|$|E
500|$|Sean Young was {{originally}} cast as Vicki Vale, but {{was injured in}} a horse-riding accident prior to commencement of filming. Young's departure necessitated an urgent search for an actress who, besides being right for the part, could commit to the film at very short notice. Peters suggested Kim Basinger: {{she was able to}} join the production immediately and was cast. As a fan of Michael Gough's work in various Hammer Film Productions, Burton cast Gough as Bruce Wayne's butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Robert Wuhl was cast as reporter Alexander Knox. His character {{was originally}} supposed to die by the Joker's poison gas in the climax, but the filmmakers [...] "liked [...] character so much," [...] Wuhl said, [...] "that they decided to let me live." [...] Burton chose Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent because he wanted to include the villain Two-Face in a future film using the concept of an African-American Two-Face for the black and white concept, but Tommy Lee Jones was later cast in the role for Batman Forever, which disappointed Williams. Nicholson convinced the filmmakers to cast his close friend Tracey Walter as the Joker's henchman, Bob. Kiefer Sutherland was considered as Robin before the character was deleted from the shooting script. The rest of the cast included Pat <b>Hingle</b> as Commissioner Gordon, Jerry Hall as Alicia Hunt, Lee Wallace as Mayor Borg, William Hootkins as Lt. Max Eckhardt, and Jack Palance as crime boss Carl Grissom.|$|E

Wouk was extremely critical of Halsey's handling of the battle at Leyte Gulf, but also said he was too great a builder of naval morale to be retired in disgrace. [...] (Chapter 92) [...] Halsey was portrayed in the 1983 television miniseries adaptation of The Winds of War by Richard X.

2500|$|BBC's Steve Holden called Bennington the [...] "voice of a generation", {{saying his}} voice was arguably Linkin Park's {{greatest}} asset. Jonathan McAloon of The Daily Telegraph commented, [...] "Bennington’s death {{will have an impact}} on many millennials because {{his voice was}} the sound of their millennium". Writing for The Guardian, Ben Beaumont-Thomas noted [...] "Bennington’s decision to sing clearly and openly was, therefore, more radical than he is given credit for, and indeed more socially valuable". The journalist continued to discuss Bennington's impact, commenting, [...] "His cleanly articulated tales of emotional struggle gave millions the sense that someone understood them, and the huge sound of his band around him magnified that sense, moving listeners from the psychic space of their bedrooms into an arena of thousands of people who shared their pain". James <b>Hingle</b> echoed this sentiment, writing for Kerrang! he said that Bennington [...] "was one of the most honest vocalists out there when it came to his mental health". In the same topic, William Goodman from Billboard said Bennington and fellow musicians Chris Cornell and Scott Weiland [...] "helped define a generation of the hard rock sound, who were tied together artistically and personally".|$|E
