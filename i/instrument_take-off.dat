Experimental EPMA measurements made on NIST SRM 481 (AgAu) and 482 (CuAu) alloys, at a range of accelerating potential and <b>instrument</b> <b>take-off</b> angles, represent a formal microanalysis data set that has been used to develop phi(rho z) correction algorithms.

40|$|Monte Carlo (MC) {{modeling}} {{has been}} used extensively to simulate electron scattering and x-ray emission from complex geometries. Here are presented comparisons between MC results and experimental electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA) measurements as well as phi(rhoz) correction algorithms. Experimental EPMA measurements made on NIST SRM 481 (AgAu) and 482 (CuAu) alloys, at a range of accelerating potential and <b>instrument</b> <b>take-off</b> angles, represent a formal microanalysis data set that has been widely used to develop phi(rhoz) correction algorithms. X-ray intensity data produced by MC simulations represents an independent test of both experimental and phi(rhoz) correction algorithms. The alpha-factor method has previously been used to evaluate systematic errors {{in the analysis of}} semiconductor and silicate minerals, and is used here to compare the accuracy of experimental and MC-calculated x-ray data. X-ray intensities calculated by MC are used to generate a-factors using the certificated compositions in the CuAu binary relative to pure Cu and Au standards. MC simulations are obtained using the NIST, WinCasino, and WinXray algorithms; derived x-ray intensities have a built-in atomic number correction, and are further corrected for absorption and characteristic fluorescence using the PAP phi(rhoz) correction algorithm. The Penelope code additionally simulates both characteristic and continuum x-ray fluorescence and thus requires no further correction for use in calculating alpha-factors...|$|E

As the design was improved, he flew the newer variants, including the advanced D-model, specializing in checkout flights [...] "on the sophisticated electronic units which make the jet literally 'automatic'." [...] In early 1960, he successfully completed a 300-mile roundtrip flight with [...] "hands-off" [...] or all on <b>instruments</b> except for <b>take-off</b> and landing.
