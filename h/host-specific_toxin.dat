50|$|Frances Meehan Latterell (December 21, 1920 - November 5, 2008) was an American plant {{pathologist}} whose {{research in the}} late 1940s opened a major new area of inquiry into the physiological basis of plant disease. She was the senior author on a classic 1947 paper showing that the toxin victorin, produced by the pathogenic fungus Helminthosporium victoriae, caused symptoms of Victoria blight of oats, a new disease first described by Latterell and her major professor in 1946. This discovery of a <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxin,</b> as victorin was later named, gave scores of subsequent researchers new model systems for studying plant disease.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{thousands}} of species of plant pathogenic microorganisms, only a small minority {{have the capacity to}} infect a broad range of plant species. Most pathogens instead exhibit a high degree of host-specificity. Non-host plant species are often said to express non-host resistance. The term host resistance is used when a pathogen species can be pathogenic on the host species but certain strains of that plant species resist certain strains of the pathogen species. The causes of host resistance and non-host resistance can overlap. Pathogen host range is determined, among other things, by the presence of appropriate effectors that allow colonization of a particular host. Pathogen host range can change quite suddenly if, for example, the pathogen's capacity to synthesize a <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxin</b> or effector is gained by gene shuffling/mutation, or by horizontal gene transfer.|$|E

40|$|Helminthosporium maydis, race T, {{produces}} four <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins</b> in culture. These {{have been}} designated toxins I, II, III, and IV. A method for isolation and purification {{of the four}} toxins is presented, and the criteria of purity of preparations of toxins I, II, and III are given. Toxins I and II are chemically similar and yield the same molecular ion when subjected to mass spectrometry, while toxin III {{appears to be a}} glycoside of a compound related to toxins I and II. Toxins I, II, and III can be biologically derived from 14 C-mevalonic acid or 14 C-acetate, permitting preparation of 14 C-labeled toxins. Some chemical, spectral, and chromatographic properties of toxins I, II, and III are presented, and these data are discussed relative to the possible structure of the three compounds. In addition, four <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins</b> have been isolated from corn infected with H. maydis (race T).

40|$|We are {{analysing}} {{the wheat}} pathogen Stagonospora nodorum {{in order to}} determine the molecular basis of its pathogenicity. The genome sequence of S. nodorum has been obtained and compared to the tan spot pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis. Combined analyses of genome sequences, specific wheat populations segregating for susceptibility, and pathogen population genetics have revealed a new model of pathogenicity in S. nodorum. In this model, the pathogen expresses at least 4 different <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins</b> (HSTs), each toxin interacting with a different host susceptibility gene. Interaction leads to necrosis which, unlike a classical gene-for-gene system, benefits fungal reproduction. The consequences of this model for disease control will be discussed. The evolutionary history of the toxin genes can be inferred by analysis of the genome sequences and by sampling geographically distinct pathogen populations. We have presented evidence that ToxA has been laterally transferred both into S. nodorum and from S. nodorum into P. tritici-repentis. The fate of the transferred DNA in P. tritici-repentis has been examined, and evidence of gene duplication and gene loss was found. The history of twentieth-century emergence of plant disease is littered with examples of fungi related to S. nodorum and P. tritici-repentis, whose pathogenicity is determined by <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins.</b> The idea that lateral transfer of the HST genes might be a common theme of these twentieth century diseases will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Host-specific</b> <b>toxin</b> {{from the}} rough lemon (Citrus jambhiri Lush) pathotype of Alternaria alternata (ACR toxin) was tested for effects on {{mitochondria}} isolated from several citrus species. The toxin caused uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation {{and changes in}} membrane potential in mitochondria from leaves of the susceptible host (rough lemon); the effects differed from those of carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, a typical protonophore. ACR toxin also inhibited malate oxidation, apparently {{because of lack of}} NAD+ in the matrix. In contrast, the toxin had no effect on mitochondria from citrus species (Dancy tangerine and Emperor mandarin [Citrus reticulata Blanco], and grapefruit [Citrus paradisi Macf. ]) that are not hosts of the fungus. The effects of the toxin on mitochondria from rough lemon are similar to the effects of a <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxin</b> from Helminthosporium maydis (HMT) on mitochondria from T-cytoplasm maize. Both ACR and HMT toxins are highly selective for the respective host plants. HMT toxin and methomyl had no effect (toxic or protective) on the activity of ACR toxin against mitochondria from rough lemon...|$|E

40|$|The Deuteromycetes fungal genus Alternaria {{comprises}} {{of different}} saprophytic {{as well as}} endophytic species and {{is well known for}} its notoriously destructive plant pathogen members. It has been found to have a drastic effect on the members belonging to the plant families such as Cucurbitaceae, Brassicaceae, Solanaceae which are having nutritional as well as economical food value. Majority of the members of Alternaria lack sexuality altogether, although few species have been found to have sexual stage in their life cycles. Several types of genes ranging from protein encoding genes to those involved in signal transduction cascades are found to be responsible for the pathogenesis. Production of <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins</b> (HSTs) is found to be an affirming factor of pathogenesis. Most fungal <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins</b> are metabolites although toxic substances including despipeptides and fucicoccin-like compounds. Genes encoding the biosynthesis of these HSTs are often contained on mostly conditionally dispensable chromosomes. The necrotrophic nature of Alternaria species typically leads to extensive damage of the plant and harvest product, with seedlings seldom surviving an attack. Apart from the role of toxins in Alternaria pathogenesis, few genes and /or gene products have been found to have a propounding effect as a pre-requisite for pathogenicity. For controlling the diseases, numbers of new chemicals are evaluated along with various biological control agents including bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi. Some plants and plant products are also found to be useful in controlling Alternaria infection...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 99 strains of 11 Alternaria species, {{including}} 68 strains of seven fungi known to produce <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins,</b> {{were subjected to}} analysis of {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) in nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Total DNA was digested with XbaI, and the Southern blots were probed with a nuclear rDNA clone of Alternaria kikuchiana. The hybridization gave 17 different RFLPs from the 99 strains. On the basis of these RFLPs, populations of host-specific toxin-producing fungi could not be differentiated from one another nor from nonpathogenic A. alternata. Each population of the toxin-producing fungi carried rDNA variants. Nine different types, named A 1 to A 6 and B 1 to B 3, were detected among the toxin-producing fungi and nonpathogenic A. alternata. All of the populations contained the type A 4 variant, and the other rDNA types were also shared by different toxin-producing fungi and A. alternata. In contrast, Alternaria species that are morphologically distinguishable from A. alternata could be differentiated from A. alternata {{on the basis of the}} rDNA RFLPs. Polymorphisms in rDNA digested with HaeIII and MspI were also evaluated in 61 Alternaria strains. These restriction enzymes produced 31 variations among all of the samples. The seven toxin-producing fungi and nonpathogenic A. alternata could not be resolved by phylogenetic analysis based on the RFLPs, although they could be differentiated from the other Alternaria species studied. These results provide support for the hypothesis that Alternaria fungi known to produce <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins</b> are intraspecific variants of A. alternata specialized in pathogenicity...|$|R
40|$|Alternaria {{species are}} mainly {{saprophytic}} fungi, {{but some are}} plant pathogens. Seven pathotypes of Alternaria alternata use sec-ondary metabolites of <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins</b> as pathogenicity factors. These toxins kill host cells prior to colonization. Genes asso-ciated with toxin synthesis reside on conditionally dispensable chromosomes, supporting the notion that pathogenicity might have been acquired several times by A. alternata. Alternaria brassicicola, however, seems to employ a different mechanism. Evi-dence {{on the use of}} <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins</b> as pathogenicity factors remains tenuous, even after a diligent search aided by full-ge-nome sequencing and efficient reverse-genetics approaches. Similarly, no individual genes encoding lipases or cell wall-degrad-ing enzymes have been identified as strong virulence factors, although these enzymes have been considered important for fungal pathogenesis. This review describes our current understanding of toxins, lipases, and cell wall-degrading enzymes and their roles in the pathogenesis of A. brassicicola compared to those of other pathogenic fungi. It also describes a set of genes that affect pathogenesis in A. brassicicola. They are involved in various cellular functions that are likely important in most organisms and probably indirectly associated with pathogenesis. Deletion or disruption of these genes results in weakly virulent strains that appear {{to be sensitive to the}} defense mechanisms of host plants. Finally, this review discusses the implications of a recent discov-ery of three important transcription factors associated with pathogenesis and the putative downstream genes that they regulate. The bodies of plant-pathogenic fungi consist of growing hyphaeand reproductive structures, although they are barely visible to the naked eye. Some fungi develop sexual spores during their lif...|$|R

One of these was tentatively identified as 2 -amino- 2, 3 -dehydro- 3 -methylpentanoic acid by electrolytic reduction to isoleucine. Additional ninhydrin-reacting substances were produced in low yield and probably represented secondary hydrolysis products of the unstable amino acids.

40|$|A cursory {{glance at}} old {{textbooks}} of plant pathology {{reveals that the}} diseases which are the current scourge of agriculture {{in many parts of}} the world are a different set from those that were prominent 50 or 100 years ago. Why have these new diseases arisen? The traditional explanations subscribe to the “nature abhors a vacuum” principle—that control of one disease creates the condition for the emergence of a replacement—but does little to explain why the new pathogen succeeds. The emergence of a new disease requires a series of conditions and steps, including the enhanced fecundity of the new pathogen, enhanced survival from season to season, and spread around the world. Recently, evidence was obtained that wheat tan spot emerged through a lateral gene transfer event some time prior to 1941. Although there have been sporadic and persistent reports of lateral gene transfer between and into fungal plant pathogens, most examples have been dismissed through incomplete evidence. The completion of whole genome sequences of an increasing number of fungal pathogens no longer allows such proposed cases of lateral gene transfer to be dismissed so easily. How frequent are lateral gene transfers involving fungal plant pathogens, and can this process explain the emergence of many of the new diseases of the recent past? Many of the apparently new diseases are dependant on the expression of <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins.</b> These are enigmatic molecules whose action requires the presence of plant genes with products that specifically encode sensitivity to the toxin and susceptibility to the disease. It is also notable that many new diseases belong to the fungal taxon dothideomycetes. This review explores the coincidence of new diseases, interspecific gene transfer, <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins,</b> and the dothideomycete class...|$|R
40|$|<b>Host-specific</b> <b>toxins</b> from Helminthosporium victoriae (HV) and Periconia circinata (PC) caused gradual {{decreases}} {{in the negative}} electropotentials of single cells of susceptible but not of resistant plants. When tissues were held in a standard nutrient solution, the decrease (depolarization) induced by HV toxin was approximately 50 mv/hr; the decrease induced by PC toxin was even more gradual. Changes in ion efflux were detected before changes in electropotential. In contrast, toxin from H. carbonum caused a rapid but transient increase in negative electropotential of cells. Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, which (like other metabolic inhibitors) blocks electrogenic pumps, caused cell electropotentials to decrease by approximately 50 mv within a few minutes. This suggests that HV and PC toxins do not have direct effects on electrogenic pumps, but do affect passive efflux of ions, or electrically neutral ion exchange systems, across the plasma membrane...|$|R
40|$|<b>Host-specific</b> <b>toxins</b> {{produced}} by Helminthosporium maydis, race T, are measured quantitatively by a chemical assay procedure involving {{reaction of the}} toxins with a sulfuric acidacetic anhydride reagent and {{measurement of the absorbance}} of the product at 330 nm. The assay was shown to measure total toxin concentrations after only limited fractionation of the culture medium. Using the assay it was possible to show that the highest amount of toxin per gram of fungus mycelium occurs early in the growth cycle of H. maydis. Toxins I, II, and V are the predominant toxins at these early times both in culture and in infected corn and wheat varieties. Some chromatographic and spectral properties of toxin V, a previously unreported toxin, are described. Since toxin V appears in culture prior to toxins I, II, III and IV, a precursor-product relationship can be suggested...|$|R

40|$|A {{recent survey}} of {{worldwide}} isolates of Stagonospora nodorum showed that all Australian isolates expressed the <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxin</b> ToxA (Stukenbrock and McDonald 2007).

We therefore postulated that the wheat gene that confers sensitivity to ToxA, Tsn 1, would vary in prevalence in wheat cultivars in use in the two countries. Contrary to expectation, 10 out of 21 Chinese cultivars responded to ToxA as did 26 out of 46 Australian cultivars. The result suggests that ToxA {{has not had a}} determining effect on the survival of wheat cultivars in either country. They also suggest that despite the widespread use of Tsn 1 markers in Australia, sensitive alleles are still commonplace.

40|$|This review {{provides}} an overview of members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters identified in filamentous fungi. The most common function of these membrane proteins is to provide protection against natural toxic compounds present in the environment of fungi, such as antibiotics produced by other microorganisms. In plant pathogenic fungi, these transporters can also be an important determinant of virulence on host plants by providing protection against plant defence compounds or mediating the secretion of <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins.</b> Furthermore, they {{play a critical role in}} determining base-line sensitivity to fungicides and other antimycotic agents. Overexpression of some of these transporters can lead to the development of resistance to chemically-unrelated compounds, a phenomenon described as multidrug resistance (MDR).

It is unstable in dilute acids, yielding ninhydrin-reacting products. Complete acid hydrolysis yields alanine, proline, and three other ninhydrin-reacting components. The infrared spectrum of the toxin reveals an ester band in addition to amide absorption. Its ultraviolet spectrum reveals the presence of unsaturation in the molecule.

Toxin-treated susceptible roots removed nitrate from solution and accumulated it in the tissues {{twice as fast as}} did control roots. Uptake by resistant roots was stimulated also, provided approximately 100 times higher concentrations of toxin were used. Toxin-stimulated nitrate uptake occurred in the presence of tungstate, which eliminates nitrate reductase activity. Toxin did not cause leakage of nitrate from roots under these conditions. Thus, toxin-enhanced nitrate accumulation was caused by increased nitrate uptake rather than by decreased nitrate metabolism or decreased nitrate leakage. The data indicate that toxin increases the rate of nitrate reduction in vivo by increasing the availability of substrate, not by stimulation of enzyme synthesis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Host-specific</b> <b>toxins</b> (HSTs) {{are defined}} as {{pathogen}} effectors that induce toxicity and promote disease only in the host species and only in genotypes of that host expressing a specific and often dominant susceptibility gene. They are a feature of a small but well-studied group of fungal plant pathogens. Classical HST pathogens include species of Cochliobolus, Alternaria and Pyrenophora. Recent {{studies have shown that}} Stagonospora nodorum produces at least four separate HSTs that interact with four of the many quantitative resistance loci found in the host, wheat. Rationalization of fungal phylogenetics has placed these pathogens in the Pleosporales order of the class Dothideomycetes. It is possible that all HST pathogens lie in this order. Strong evidence of the recent lateral gene transfer of the ToxA gene from S. nodorum to Pyrenophora tritici-repentis has been obtained. Hallmarks of lateral gene transfer are present for all the studied HST genes although definitive proof is lacking. We therefore suggest that the Pleosporales pathogens may have a conserved propensity to acquire HST genes by lateral transfer...|$|R
40|$|The {{filamentous}} fungus Alternaria alternata contains seven pathogenic variants (pathotypes), which produce <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins</b> and cause diseases on different plants. Previously, the gene cluster involved in host-specific AK-toxin biosynthesis of the Japanese pear pathotype was isolated, and four genes, named AKT genes, were identified. The AKT homologs {{were also found}} in the strawberry and tangerine pathotypes, which produce AF-toxin and ACT-toxin, respectively. This result is consistent {{with the fact that the}} toxins of these pathotypes share a common 9, 10 -epoxy- 8 -hydroxy- 9 -methyl-decatrienoic acid structural moiety. In this study, three of the AKT homologs (AFT 1 - 1, AFTR- 1, and AFT 3 - 1) were isolated on a single cosmid clone from strain NAF 8 of the strawberry pathotype. In NAF 8, all of the AKT homologs were present in multiple copies on a 1. 05 -Mb chromosome. Transformation-mediated targeting of AFT 1 - 1 and AFT 3 - 1 in NAF 8 produced AF-toxin-minus, nonpathogenic mutants. All of the mutants lacked the 1. 05 -Mb chromosome encoding the AFT genes. This chromosome was not essential for saprophytic growth of this pathogen. Thus, we propose that a conditionally dispensable chromosome controls host-specific pathogenicity of this pathogen...|$|R
40|$|Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, {{the causal}} {{organism}} of the necrotrophic foliar wheat disease tan spot [also known as yellow (leaf) spot in Australia] {{is an important}} disease in Australia and {{in many parts of}} the world. North American isolates of the pathogen have been shown to produce combinations of three <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins,</b> ToxA, ToxB and ToxC. Each toxin interacts with a host sensitivity locus, respectively Tsn 1, Tsc 2 and Tsc 1. The virulence of an isolate is partially correlated with the presence of these toxins and resistance in the host is associated with absence of the sensitivity loci. Breeding for resistance to tan spot can, therefore, be aided by knowledge of the prevalence of the toxin-encoding genes in local pathogen populations. Two of the toxins, A and B, are encoded by known genes and molecular tests for the genes have been developed. We screened a diverse collection of 119 tan spot isolates collected between 1984 and 2008 and from all affected regions of Australia (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia).

At 5 to 30 nanograms per milliliter (≅ 5 nanomolar), toxin significantly inhibited (20 to 40 %) dark CO 2 fixation in susceptible (T) corn slices after either dark or light preincubations of 10 - 20 minutes.

Light preincubation without toxin did not shorten the time required for inhibition of photosynthesis after addition of toxin.

Seeds were then washed thoroughly and incubated on moist paper, or dried and stored for 2 - 3 weeks before germination was attempted. In both cases, germination of susceptible seeds was prevented by previous exposure to toxin for 1 hour or more. Control seeds and treated resistant seeds grew normally. Toxin {{did not affect}} O 2 uptake or loss of carbohydrates from seeds for the first 12 hours of imbibition. After 12 hours, toxin-treated susceptible seeds had higher respiration and lost more carbohydrates than did control seeds. Experiments with embryoless seeds showed that toxin blocked synthesis and secretion of α-amylase by susceptible but not by resistant aleurone cells. Resting aleurone cells were exposed briefly to toxin, then dried and stored until all toxin was gone. Susceptible aleurone cells treated in this way failed to produce α-amylase following exposure to gibberellic acid, while controls and resistant treated aleurone tissues produced amylase. Susceptibility or resistance to toxin appears to be expressed in resting and metabolically active tissues...|$|E
40|$|Brown spot, {{caused by}} Stemphylium vesicarium, is one the most {{important}} pear disease in Europe. The disease is caused by fungal strains producing <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins</b> which {{are responsible for the}} disease symptoms on some pear varieties. It is known that there is a high degree of differentiation in host specificity among the different isolates of S. vesicarium. Pathogenicity and virulence of 78 S. vesicarium strains obtained from pear and other host species were studied by a leaf necrosis assay on 3 pear varieties showing different susceptibility to natural brown spot epidemics. The bioassay was performed using conidial suspensions and autoclaved fungal culture filtrates. Strains of S. vesicarium showed high variability for both progress of necrotic spot appearance and final disease incidence. Four virulence groups were defined using a multivariate data analysis. Group I included 49 strains from pear, which caused severe necrosis on all the varieties. Group II included only 5 strains isolated from pear which caused severe necrosis on ‘Abate Fétel’ and ‘Conference’, as the strains of group I did, but symptoms on ‘William’ were very light. In group III there were 19 strains from pear which showed less severe symptoms on all the varieties. Finally, group IV was formed by the S. vesicarium strains isolated from asparagus, pea, and onion, as well as the un-inoculated test. These fungal strains showed only small sporadic necrosis at the end of incubation...|$|R
40|$|Citrus is {{affected}} by four diseases caused by Alternaria spp. Brown spot of tangerines, leaf spot of rough lemon, postharvest black rot of fruit occur widely in citrus {{areas of the world}} and are caused by different pathotypes of A. alternata. Mancha foliar occurs only on Mexican lime in western Mexico and is caused by A. limicola. Tangerine and rough lemon pathotypes produce <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins</b> that affect membranes and respiration, respectively. Black rot is always associated with wounds and is caused by most citrus-associated isolates of A. alternata that produce endopolygalacturonase. Alternaria brown spot is a serious disease of susceptible tangerines and their hybrids in semi-arid Mediterranean climates as well as in more humid areas. Conidia, produced on lesions on mature and senescent leaves and stems under humid conditions, are dispersed by wind, and infect all juvenile tissues of susceptible cultivars when temperature and leaf wetness conditions are favorable. Commercially acceptable cultivars resistant to brown spot are being developed. Disease severity can be reduced by planting disease-free nursery stock on wider spacings, pruning tree skirts, and reducing irrigation and nitrogen fertilization. However, fungicides such as dithiocarbamates, triazoles, strobilurins, iprodione, or copper fungicides are used in most areas for disease control. A disease-forecasting model, the Alter-Rater, has been developed in Florida to assist in timing fungicide sprays...|$|R
40|$|Since the <b>host-specific</b> <b>toxins</b> of Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici play an {{important}} role in pathogenesis, they potentially could be applied as selective agents in in vitro selection at the cellular level for disease resistance. Prerequisite for this is that sensitivity to the Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici pathotoxins is manifest at the cellular level. To gain insight into cellular effects of AAL-toxins and into the mechanisms of plant insensitivity to AAL-toxins, effects of AAL-toxins on leaves, leaf discs, roots, calli, suspension cells, minicalli and protoplasts of susceptible and resistant tomato genotypes were studied. In leaves of susceptible genotypes, toxins cause severe necrosis, while in leaves of resistant genotypes necrosis was never observed. Inhibition effects of toxins were observed at all other levels in susceptible and resistant genotypes: toxins inhibited shoot induction on leaf discs, root growth and growth of calli, suspension cells and protoplasts. This indicates a cellular site for AAL-toxins. Differences in sensitivity to AAL-toxins between susceptible and resistant genotypes were observed in leaves and roots, but were not observed during shoot induction on leaf discs, in calli, suspension cells and protoplasts. However, differences in sensitivity to AAL-toxins in roots were at least 20 times less than in leaves. Therefore insensitivity seems related to a higher level of tomato plant differentiation and is most pronounced in leaves. ...|$|R
