50|$|An {{electronic}} component is any basic <b>discrete</b> <b>device</b> or physical entity in an electronic system used to affect electrons or their associated fields.

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Table  3 and Fig.  6, {{considering}} the reserve index of the dynamic devices and the economic index of the <b>discrete</b> <b>devices</b> in the control objectives utilizing the historical operation information, the regulating times of the <b>discrete</b> <b>devices</b> are decreased and the dynamic reactive power reserve is increased in control mode II. Moreover, by implementing the differentiated management between the <b>discrete</b> <b>devices</b> and the dynamic devices of the WPPC, the <b>discrete</b> <b>devices</b> can undertake the basis reactive power support and the dynamic devices can compensate the real-time shortfall of the reactive power caused by the wind power fluctuation in control mode II.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{emphasizes}} the educational aspect of <b>discrete</b> <b>devices.</b> The growing complexity of such systems requires both extended {{skills of the}} engineers and extended methods in their education. The details of modern <b>discrete</b> <b>devices</b> are created by computers. Hence, computers must {{be included in the}} education process. Together with an extended educational concept we show in this paper how specialized software supports the educational process.

30|$|The reserve {{index of}} the dynamic devices and the {{economic}} {{index of the}} <b>discrete</b> <b>devices</b> are taken into consideration on the control objectives utilizing the historical operation information.

30|$|Consequently, we {{considered}} methods {{to increase the}} dynamic reactive power capacity of the system, such as deploying additional static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs). There have already been studies assessing the STATCOM capacity required to avoid cascading after (N− 1) faults [4, 5, 6]. However, {{there have been few}} studies on improving the operation schedules of <b>discrete</b> <b>devices,</b> such as shunt capacitors/reactors and on-load tap changers (OLTCs), to maintain a more stable dynamic reactive-power reserve. In fact, the current behavior of <b>discrete</b> <b>devices</b> is far from optimal, so {{it is not surprising that}} voltage violations occur and that there is a lack of dynamic reactive-power reserves. The difficulties that arise due to uncertainties in wind-power generation and the limited availability of <b>discrete</b> <b>devices</b> must be overcome before we can properly solve the problem.|$|R
40|$|Mosfets are {{currently}} being used in {{an increasing number of}} applications, especially battery powered and high frequency systems. In many of these systems several chips must be paralleled to achieve the necessary performance. The chips can either be paralleled as discrete plastic packages, or as chips within a hybrid module. Hybrid modules have the advantage over paralleled <b>discrete</b> <b>devices</b> when more than 5 chips in parallel are required to develop a design. In this type of system the hybrid module will be the smallest, electrically isolating the module will be easiest, thermal management will be the best, and the total system cost will be the lowest. Paralleled <b>discrete</b> <b>devices</b> have the advantage over hybrid modules when only 2 or 3 chips in parallel are required to develop a design. In this type of a system, <b>discrete</b> <b>devices</b> paralleled on a PCB provide the smallest footprint. Also electrical isolation and parasitic inductance are usually not difficult to manage in this size system. Several applications, and their implementations as parallel <b>discrete</b> <b>devices</b> on a PCB and as hybrid modules, are discussed and used to illustrate the tradeoffs between solutions...|$|R
50|$|Blade PCs {{support one}} or more common {{operating}} systems (for instance Microsoft has created a “blade PC” version of their XP and Vista Business operating systems and many Linux distributions are installable). Importantly, these solutions are intended to support one user per <b>discrete</b> <b>device.</b> This is a major difference from server-based computing, which supports multiple users simultaneously using an application hosted on one discrete server (be it a discrete piece of hardware or a discrete virtual machine on a server).|$|E
50|$|While {{pycnometers}} (of any type) {{are recognized}} as density measuring devices {{they are in fact}} devices for measuring volume only. Density is merely calculated as the ratio of mass to volume; mass being invariably measured on a <b>discrete</b> <b>device,</b> usually by weighing. The volume measured in a gas pycnometer is that amount of three-dimensional space which is inaccessible to the gas used, i.e. that volume within the sample chamber from which the gas is excluded. Therefore, the volume measured considering the finest scale of surface roughness will depend on the atomic or molecular size of the gas. Helium therefore is most often prescribed as the measurement gas, not only is it of small size, it is also inert and the most ideal gas.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{limitations}} {{in the number}} of spaceflights and crewmembers in which novel countermeasures can be tested, future development, evaluation and validation of new countermeasures to the effects of skeletal muscle unloading will likely employ variations of these same basic ground-based models. Prospective countermeasures may include pharmacologic and/or dietary interventions, innovative exercise hardware providing improved loading modalities, locomotor training devices, passive exercise devices, and artificial gravity either as an integral component of the spacecraft or as a <b>discrete</b> <b>device</b> contained within it. With respect to the latter, the hemodynamic and metabolic responses to increased loading provided by a human-powered centrifuge have been described recently. [...] Even more recently, an approach to provide both aerobic and resistive exercise by incorporating a cage-like platform into the design has been developed by the same investigator group.|$|E

The primary reasons are cost and customization. Costs are too high for integrated circuit companies to integrate customized high-performance for niche markets. Costs performance trade-offs are met more easily with <b>discrete</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|Automotive alternators {{require a}} voltage {{regulator}} which operates by modulating the small field current to produce a constant voltage at the battery terminals. Early designs (c.1960s-1970s) used a <b>discrete</b> <b>device</b> mounted elsewhere in the vehicle. Intermediate designs (c.1970s-1990s) incorporated the voltage regulator into the alternator housing. Modern designs {{do away with the}} voltage regulator altogether; voltage regulation is now a function of the electronic control unit (ECU). The field current is much smaller than the output current of the alternator; for example, a 70 A alternator may need only 7 A of field current. The field current is supplied to the rotor windings by slip rings. The low current and relatively smooth slip rings ensure greater reliability and longer life than that obtained by a DC generator with its commutator and higher current being passed through its brushes.|$|E
