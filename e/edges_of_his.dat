5|$|Remi {{developed}} {{a love of}} cinema, favouring Winsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur and the films of Charlie Chaplin, Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton; his later work in the comic strip medium displayed an obvious influence from them in style and content. Although not a keen reader, he enjoyed the novels of British and American authors, such as Huckleberry Finn, Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe and The Pickwick Papers, {{as well as the}} novels of Frenchman Alexandre Dumas. Drawing as a hobby, he sketched out scenes from daily life along the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> school books. Some of these illustrations were of German soldiers, because his four years of primary schooling at the Ixelles Municipal School No. 3 coincided with the First World War, during which Brussels was occupied by the German army. In 1919, his secondary education began at the secular Place de Londres in Ixelles, but in 1920 he was moved to Saint-Boniface School, an institution controlled by the archbishop where the teachers were Roman Catholic priests. Remi proved a successful student, being awarded prizes for excellence. He completed his secondary education in July 1925 as the top of his class.|$|E
25|$|John's final {{campaign}} in France {{took place in}} 1378. He planned a 'great expedition' of mounted men in a large armada of ships to land at Brest and take control of Brittany. Not enough ships could be found to transport the horses, and the expedition was tasked with the more limited objective of capturing St. Malo. The English destroyed the shipping in St. Malo harbour and began to assault the town by land on 14 August, but John was soon hampered {{by the size of}} his army, which was unable to forage because French armies under Olivier de Clisson and Bertrand du Guesclin occupied the surrounding countryside, harrying the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> force. In September, the siege was simply abandoned and the army returned ingloriously to England. John of Gaunt received most of the blame for the debâcle.|$|E
25|$|Mickey's eyes, {{as drawn}} in Plane Crazy and The Gallopin' Gaucho, were large and white with black {{outlines}}. In Steamboat Willie, the bottom {{portion of the}} black outlines was removed, although the upper edges still contrasted with his head. Mickey's eyes were later re-imagined as only consisting of the small black dots which were originally his pupils, while what were the upper <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eyes became a hairline. This is evident only when Mickey blinks. Fred Moore later redesigned the eyes to be small white eyes with pupils and gave his face a Caucasian skin tone instead of plain white. This new Mickey first appeared in 1938 {{on the cover of}} a party program, and in animation the following year with the release of The Pointer. Mickey is sometimes given eyebrows as seen in The Simple Things (1953) and in the comic strip, although he does not have eyebrows in his most recent appearances.|$|E

25|$|Mumbai's innings began poorly as Mohit Sharma and Albie Morkel troubled their batsmen with {{straight}} deliveries. Both opening batsmen, Dwayne Smith and Aditya Tare, and Rohit Sharma lost their wickets {{within the first}} four overs for 16 runs. Dinesh Karthik and Ambati Rayudu attempted to build a partnership but also struggled and Karthik was dismissed after they added 36 runs. In came Kieron Pollard in the tenth over and immediately played aggressively. Pollard and Rayudu were able to score more freely against Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja to lift Mumbai to 100 for 4 after 15 overs. The following delivery, Rayudu fell to Dwayne Bravo for 37 runs and Mumbai was left with only Pollard and their bowlers. Harbhajan Singh briefly provided support for Pollard with boundaries coming from the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bat before he fell to Bravo off a mishit. The remaining batsmen only made minimal contributions and most were dismissed by Bravo, who finished with figures of 4 for 42. Despite Pollard getting his third half-century of the season, Mumbai could only achieve a total of 148 for 9.|$|E
500|$|Don Pullen, who bridged {{free and}} {{mainstream}} jazz, [...] "had a technique of rolling his wrists as he improvised—the outside <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hands became scarred from it—to create moving tone clusters," [...] writes critic Ben Ratliff. [...] "Building up from arpeggios, he could create eddies of noise on the keyboard...like concise Cecil Taylor outbursts." [...] In {{the description of}} Joachim Berendt, Pullen [...] "uniquely melodized cluster playing and made it tonal. He phrases impulsively raw clusters {{with his right hand}} and yet embeds them in clear, harmonically functional tonal chords simultaneously played with the left hand." [...] John Medeski employs tone clusters as keyboardist for Medeski, Martin, and Wood, which mixes free jazz elements into its soul jazz/jam band style.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the themes}} found in Illmatic revolve around Nas’s {{experience}} living {{in an environment where}} poverty, violence, and drug use abound. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, residents of Queensbridge experienced intense violence, as the housing development was overrun by the crack epidemic. Illmatic contains imagery inspired by this prevalence of street crime. In [...] "N.Y. State of Mind", Nas details the trap doors, rooftop snipers, street corner lookouts, and drug dealers that pervade his urban [...] Sohail Daulatzai describes this language as [...] "chilling" [...] and suggests that it “harrowingly describes and imagines with such surreal imagery, with so much noir discontent and even more fuck-you ambition, the fragile and tenuous lives of ghetto dwellers…” Author Adam Mansbach interprets Nas's violent aesthetics as a metaphoric device meant to authenticate the rough <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> persona: [...] "Nas's world and worldview are criminal and criminalized. Hence, he uses metaphoric violence as a central trope of his poetic.” Writer and musician Gregory Tate regards this violent imagery as part of a trend towards dark subject matter that came to prevail among East Coast rappers in the hardcore hip hop scene. He writes, “ome of the most memorably dark, depressive but flowing lyrics in hip hop history were written by Nas, Biggie, and members of the Wu-Tang Clan on the death knell of the crack trade.|$|E

2500|$|At [...] {{in height}} and , Forrest was {{physically}} imposing and intimidating, especially {{compared to the}} average height of men at the time.

2500|$|Through his {{membership}} in a local Moose Club, Gacy became aware of a [...] "Jolly Joker" [...] clown club whose members—dressed as clowns—would regularly perform at fundraising events and parades in addition to voluntarily entertaining hospitalized children. By late 1975, Gacy had joined the Jolly Jokers and created his own performance characters: [...] "Pogo the Clown" [...] and [...] "Patches the Clown". Gacy designed his own costumes and taught himself how to apply clown makeup, although some professional clowns noted the sharp corners Gacy painted at the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth are contrary to the rounded borders that professional clowns normally employ, {{so as not to}} scare children. Gacy is known to have performed as Pogo or Patches at numerous local parties, Democratic party functions, charitable events, and at children's hospitals. He is also known to have arrived, dressed in his clowning garb, at a favorite drinking venue named [...] "The Good Luck Lounge" [...] on several occasions with the explanation he had just performed as Pogo and was stopping for a social drink before heading home.|$|E

60|$|There was {{a lantern}} upon the table, {{and he sat}} down beside it. The yellow light shone upon his heavy cheek and the red <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> book. The strong, steady voice rose above the wash of the water.|$|E
60|$|He {{swept the}} mirror a half {{circle in the}} air to flash the tidings abroad in {{sunlight}} now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to set about it otherwise than coolly with the thermometer thirty-five below zero," [...] remarked Fred, beating his hands together, and stamping his feet, while the breath issued from his mouth like dense clouds of steam, and fringed the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hood and the breast of his jumper with hoar-frost.|$|E

60|$|During {{the contact}} of that {{unexpected}} and lingering kiss Mr Verloc, gripping {{with both hands}} the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chair, preserved a hieratic immobility. When the pressure was removed he let go the chair, rose, and went to stand before the fireplace. He turned no longer {{his back to the}} room. With his features swollen and an air of being drugged, he followed his wife’s movements with his eyes.|$|E
60|$|Kama froze {{the skin}} on his cheek-bones, despite {{frequent}} rubbings, and the flesh turned black and sore. Also he slightly froze the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lung-tissues--a dangerous thing, and the basic reason why a man should not unduly exert himself in the open at sixty-five below. But Kama never complained, and Daylight was a furnace of heat, sleeping as warmly under his six pounds of rabbit skins as the other did under twelve pounds.|$|E
60|$|If {{there is}} {{anything}} more embarrassing to a guest than a family row, {{we have yet to}} hear of it. Mike, scarlet to the extreme <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ears, concentrated himself on his plate. Comrade Prebble made a great many remarks, which were probably illuminating, if they could have been understood. Mr Waller looked, astonished, at Mr Richards. Mr Richards, pink but dogged, loosened his collar, but said nothing. Psmith, leaning forward, asked Master Edward Waller his opinion on the Licensing Bill.|$|E

6000|$|We go {{into the}} cottage. It is a small {{building}} with four rooms and a kitchen on the ground floor, but {{in the sitting room}} we come upon an open fireplace,--the first I had ever seen, and in the light of it sits Grandfather McClintock, the glory of the flaming logs gilding the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cloud of bushy white hair. He does not rise to greet us, but smiles and calls out, [...] "Come in! Come in! Draw a cheer. Sit ye down." ...|$|E
60|$|Somehow Peter {{never before}} had {{realized}} how handsome Carol the Meadow Lark was. As he faced Peter, the latter saw a beautiful yellow throat and waistcoat, with a broad black crescent on his breast. There was a yellow line above each eye. His back was of brown with black markings. His sides were whitish, with spats and streaks of black. The outer <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tail were white. Altogether he was really handsome, far handsomer than one would suspect, seeing him at a distance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me! Dear me! Dear me!" [...] cried {{rather a}} plaintive voice. Peter stopped so {{suddenly}} that he all but fell heels over head. Sitting {{on the top}} of a tall, dead, mullein stalk was a very soberly dressed but rather trim little fellow, a very little larger than Bully the English Sparrow. Above, his coat was of a dull olive-brown, while underneath he was of a grayish-white, with faint tinges of yellow in places. His head was dark, and his bill black. The feathers on his head were lifted just enough to make the tiniest kind of crest. His wings and tail were dusky, little bars of white showing very faintly on his wings, while the outer <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tail were distinctly white. He sat with his tail hanging straight down, as if he hadn't strength enough to hold it up.|$|E
