25|$|Revelation is the {{revealing}} or disclosing, {{or making}} something obvious through active or passive communication with God, and can originate directly from God, or through an agent, {{such as an}} angel. One who has experienced such contact is often called a prophet. Christianity considers the Bible as divinely or supernaturally revealed or inspired. Such revelation does not always require the presence of God or an angel. For instance, in the concept called of interior locution by Roman Catholics, supernatural revelation can include just an <b>inner</b> <b>voice</b> heard by the recipient.|$|E

500|$|Annoyed that Peter {{spends more}} time {{watching}} television than with his own family, Lois suggests he teach Meg how to drive. Peter reluctantly agrees, and unwittingly gives Meg a series of bad driving tips, including instructing her to [...] "rev" [...] her engine twice at stop lights and challenge other drivers to a race, which causes her to ultimately fail her driving test. As Peter drives them home from the DMV he notices that a show he wanted to watch is on television in a nearby house. Distracted by the show, he crashes the car into the main cable television transmitter, knocking out reception for the whole entire town of Quahog. Panicking, Peter makes a promise to Meg so that if she takes the blame for knocking down the cable transmitter, she would get a new convertible when she finally gets her licence. Once they arrive home with the transmitter still attached to the car, Lois becomes furious with Peter for placing the blame on his own daughter. Meg, of course, is blamed, {{and is about to}} admit the truth, but then decides to keep quiet, reflecting with an <b>inner</b> <b>voice,</b> a reference to The Wonder Years, at school. This shows an incredible lack of good judgment and morals by Peter. Meanwhile, Stewie, (seeing the opportunity of the dish attached to car), steals the satellite dish in a plan to create a weather control device capable of destroying the world's supply of broccoli, since Lois had forced him to eat the vegetable earlier that day.|$|E

[...] Her religious beliefs were leaning toward atheism when she claimed to hear the voice of God, and [...] "at last he let me see how I did oppose Jesus Christ... and how I did turne in upon a Covenant of works... from which time the Lord did discover to me all sorts of Ministers, and how they taught, and to know what voyce I heard".

2500|$|The Frankfurt School, and {{especially}} Herbert Marcuse, was also {{concerned with how}} people might rebel against or liberate themselves from the character-masks of life in bourgeois society, through asserting themselves authentically as social, political and sexual beings. The Frankfurt School theorists intended to show, that if in bourgeois society things appear other than they really are, this masking is not simply attributable to the disguises of competitive business relationships in the marketplace. It {{is rooted in the}} very psychological make-up, formation and behaviour of individual people. In their adaptation to bourgeois society, they argued, people internalize specific ways of concealing and revealing what they do, repressing some of their impulses and expressing others. If people are dominated, they are not dominated only by forces external to themselves, but by ideas and habits which they have internalized, and accept as being completely [...] "natural". Max Horkheimer puts it as follows: [...] "The principle of domination, based originally on brute force, acquired in the course of time a more spiritual character. The <b>inner</b> <b>voice</b> took the place of the master in issuing commands." ...|$|E

I do not know what this is for, says he, but I see that each part of it is fitted to the rest, I admire the workman in the details of his work, and I am quite certain that all these wheels only work together in this fashion for some common end which I cannot perceive. Let us compare the special ends, the means, the ordered relations of every kind, then let us listen to the <b>inner</b> <b>voice</b> of feeling; what healthy mind can reject its evidence?
