5|$|Ibn Ali was {{strongly}} influenced by Elmo Hope, and his playing was rapid and intense, retaining a sense of rhythm even when his style became increasingly unconventional. Several recordings of his playing may exist, but only one – The Max Roach Trio Featuring the Legendary Hasaan – has been released. Ibn Ali built a reputation in Philadelphia, where he influenced musicians including <b>John</b> <b>Coltrane,</b> but he remained little known elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|By late 1958, Davis {{employed}} one of {{the most}} acclaimed and profitable working bands pursuing the hard bop style. His personnel had become stable: alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, tenor saxophonist <b>John</b> <b>Coltrane,</b> pianist Bill Evans, long-serving bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Jimmy Cobb. His band played a mixture of pop standards and bebop originals by Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, and Tadd Dameron. As with all bebop-based jazz, Davis's groups improvised on the chord changes of a given song. Davis was one of many jazz musicians growing dissatisfied with bebop, and saw its increasingly complex chord changes as hindering creativity.|$|E

5|$|Coltrane for Lovers is a posthumous {{compilation}} album by American {{jazz musician}} <b>John</b> <b>Coltrane,</b> released on January 23, 2001, by Impulse! Records. Its tracks were recorded during December 1961 to April 1963 at engineer Rudy Van Gelder's recording studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. The {{first in the}} Verve for Lovers series by Verve Records, the album contains eleven of Coltrane's romantic ballads recorded during his early years with Impulse! Records. The songs feature Coltrane's classic quartet and collaborations with vocalist Johnny Hartman and pianist Duke Ellington.|$|E
5|$|Hope survived {{being shot}} by police {{as a youth}} to become a New York-based {{musician}} who recorded with several emerging stars in the mid-1950s, including trumpeter Clifford Brown, and saxophonists <b>John</b> <b>Coltrane,</b> Lou Donaldson, Jackie McLean, and Sonny Rollins. A long-term heroin user, Hope had his license to perform in New York's clubs withdrawn after a drug conviction, so he moved to Los Angeles in 1957. He was not happy during his four years on the West Coast, but had some successful collaborations there, including with saxophonist Harold Land.|$|E
5|$|Chris Carter {{also enjoyed}} and found {{inspiration}} in Pink Floyd and Tangerine Dream. Boyd Rice {{was influenced by}} the music of 60's girl groups and tiki culture. Z'EV cited Christopher Tree (Spontaneous Sound), <b>John</b> <b>Coltrane,</b> Miles Davis, Tim Buckley, Jimi Hendrix, and Captain Beefheart, among others together with Tibetan, Balinese, Javanese, Indian, and African music as influential in his artistic life. Cabaret Voltaire cited Roxy Music as their initial forerunners, as well as Kraftwerk's Trans-Europe Express. Cabaret Voltaire also recorded pieces reminiscent of musique concrète and composers such as Morton Subotnick. Nurse with Wound cited a long list of obscure free improvisation and Krautrock as recommended listening. 23 Skidoo borrowed from Fela Kuti and Miles Davis's On the Corner. Many industrial groups, including Einstürzende Neubauten, took inspiration from world music.|$|E

5|$|Coltrane was the Simpsons fourth cat, {{adopted from}} an animal shelter {{shortly after the}} death of Snowball III. Lisa is not certain she wants another cat, but her other one has haunted her and Coltrane name wins her over due to its {{resemblance}} of jazz musician John Coltrane's name. Upon bringing Coltrane home, Lisa decides to play him some of <b>John</b> <b>Coltrane</b> music on her saxophone, but the noise frightens him and he commits suicide by jumping out the window. Coltrane was the Simpsons only cat since Snowball I to have been white, although {{he was the only one}} not to be named Snowball. However, Lisa evidently considers him as part of the Snowball lineage, as she names her next cat Snowball V, implying that Coltrane was Snowball IV.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau {{was born}} on August 23, 1970, in Jacksonville, Florida. His father, Craig Mehldau, was a doctor, and his mother, Annette, was a homemaker. His sister, Leigh Anne, became a social worker. There was always a piano in the house during Mehldau's childhood, and he {{initially}} listened to pop and rock music on the radio. His family moved to West Hartford, Connecticut, when Mehldau was 10. Up to this point he had played mostly simple pop tunes and exercises from books, but the move brought him a new piano teacher, who introduced him to classical music. This new interest lasted for a few years, but {{by the age of}} 14 he was listening more to jazz, including recordings by saxophonist <b>John</b> <b>Coltrane</b> and pianist Oscar Peterson.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Lee Flanagan (March 16, 1930– November 16, 2001) was an American jazz {{pianist and}} composer. He {{grew up in}} Detroit, {{initially}} influenced by such pianists as Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, and Nat King Cole, {{and then by the}} newer bebop musicians. Within months of moving to New York in 1956, he had recorded with Miles Davis and on Sonny Rollins' landmark Saxophone Colossus. Recordings under various leaders, including the historically important Giant Steps of <b>John</b> <b>Coltrane,</b> and The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery, continued well into 1962, when he became vocalist Ella Fitzgerald's full-time accompanist. He worked with Fitzgerald for three years until 1965, and then in 1968 returned to be her pianist and musical director, this time for a decade.|$|E

5|$|Baltimore's early jazz pioneers {{included}} Blanche Calloway, one of {{the first}} female jazz bandleaders in the United States, and sister to jazz legend Cab Calloway. Both the Calloways, like many of Baltimore's prominent black musicians, studied at Frederick Douglass High School with William Llewellyn Wilson, himself a renowned performer and conductor for the first African American symphony in Baltimore. Baltimore was also home to Chick Webb, one of jazz's most heralded drummers, who became a musical star despite being born hunchbacked and crippled at the age of five years. Later Baltimoreans in jazz include Elmer Snowden, and Ethel Ennis. After Pennsylvania Avenue declined in the 1950s, Baltimore's jazz scene changed. The Left Bank Jazz Society, an organization dedicated to promoting live jazz, began holding a weekly series of concerts in 1965, featuring the biggest names in the field, including Duke Ellington and <b>John</b> <b>Coltrane.</b> The tapes from these recordings became legendary within the jazz aficionados, but they did not begin to be released until 2000, due to legal complications.|$|E
5|$|Bowie studied art, {{music and}} design, {{including}} layout and typesetting. After Terry Burns, his half-brother, {{introduced him to}} modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like Charles Mingus and <b>John</b> <b>Coltrane</b> led his mother {{to give him a}} Grafton saxophone in 1961; he was soon receiving lessons from a local musician. Bowie received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and a permanently dilated pupil, which gave a false impression of a change in the iris' colour. Despite their altercation, Underwood and Bowie remained good friends, and Underwood went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums.|$|E
5|$|A star in Stan Kenton's famous {{orchestra}} in the 1940s and 1950s, {{as well as}} that of Woody Herman, also in the 1940s, and {{winner of}} numerous awards, Manne slipped from public view as jazz became less central in popular music. In the 1960s and early 1970s, however, he helped keep jazz alive on the Los Angeles scene as part owner of the nightclub Shelly's Manne-Hole on North Cahuenga Boulevard. There, the house band was Shelly Manne and His Men, which featured some of his favorite sidemen, such as Russ Freeman, Monty Budwig, Richie Kamuca, Conte Candoli, and later Frank Strozier, John Morell, and Mike Wofford, among many other notable West Coast jazz musicians. Also appearing was a roster of jazz stars from different eras and all regions, including Ben Webster, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Les McCann, Bill Evans, <b>John</b> <b>Coltrane,</b> Sonny Stitt, Thelonious Monk, Michel Legrand, Carmen McRae, Milt Jackson, Teddy Edwards, Monty Alexander, Lenny Breau, Miles Davis, and many, many others. Stan Getz was the last to be featured (at a briefly occupied second location at Tetou's restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard), when, late in 1973, Manne was forced to close the club for financial reasons.|$|E

A former home, the <b>John</b> <b>Coltrane</b> House in Philadelphia, was {{designated}} a National Historic Landmark in 1999. His last home, the <b>John</b> <b>Coltrane</b> Home in the Dix Hills district of Huntington, New York, where he resided from 1964 until his death, {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places on June 29, 2007.
