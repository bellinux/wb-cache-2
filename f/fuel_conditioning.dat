30|$|By default, FSim populates {{the fuel}} {{moisture}} content values from the percentile values calculated in FireFamily Plus (Bradshaw and McCormick 2000) and applies those values {{to the entire}} landscape and to all surface fuel models; it does not allow <b>fuel</b> moisture <b>conditioning</b> (adjustment of fine dead fuel moisture content based on aspect, elevation, vegetation cover, and recent weather). On landscapes with significant variability in elevation and canopy cover, using a single value for dead fuel moisture across the whole landscape would tend to underestimate dead fuel moisture at higher elevations and under a forest canopy. Even though <b>fuel</b> moisture <b>conditioning</b> is not available within FSim, {{we were able to}} semi-condition dead fuel moistures because FSim can optionally use fuel moisture values specified for each fuel model separately. We conditioned dead fuel in FlamMap (Finney 2006) so that the landscape mean 1 hr timelag moisture content was approximately equal to the percentile value calculated in FireFamily-Plus, and then calculated the mean moisture content where each fuel model occurs on the landscape. Using this procedure, fuel models typically found at higher elevations and under a forest canopy (e.g., TU 5) were assigned higher dead fuel moisture content values than unsheltered fuel models found at lower elevations (e.g., GR 2 and GS 2).|$|R
40|$|Certain {{internal}} combustion engines, which run on hydrocarbon fuels, experience difficulty upon engine start-up in extreme cold weather. As ambient temperature decreases below the fuel cloud point and beyond, paraffin {{form in the}} fuel and eventually clog the fuel filter causing the engine to fail to start. This problem becomes more pronounced when the engine in question is a Diesel and the fuel utilized is biodiesel. As an alternative fuel source, biodiesel has many advantages; however, its cold weather performance is worse than even conventional diesel fuel. As biodiesel becomes more integrated into the world’s energy usage scenario, one of the systems within a Diesel engine that requires further investigation is its <b>fuel</b> <b>conditioning</b> system. This thesis describes research aimed at {{the development of a}} <b>fuel</b> <b>conditioning</b> system that utilizes several emerging technologies while decreasing the amount of electrical energy required for operation. The system utilizes a eutectic - thermoelectric (E-TE) combination which consists of a eutectic compound based latent heat storage device with adjacent thermoelectric elements to transfer waste heat stored in the eutectic reservoir into the fuel filter, thus diminishing the amount of electrical energy typically required for the <b>fuel</b> <b>conditioning</b> process. Simulations of the E-TE system are conducted while operating within three different modes (start-up, heat storage, and electrical energy generation) depending on fuel and ambient temperature conditions, while a supervisory controller distinguishes between desired operational status. The research activities and findings reported contained herein include development of E-TE system models which each consist of several components. The first of which is a set of control laws, implemented in Simulink, which control system performance using various temperature related variables. The second component is a supervisory control law, implemented in Matlab®, which controls the switching between various modes of operation. With system model developed, the viability of the system is examined...|$|E

40|$|A newly {{fabricated}} polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) {{fuel cell}} usually needs a so-called breakin/conditioning/incubation period to activate it and reach its best performance. Typically, during this activation period the cell performance increases gradually, and then reaches a plateau without further increase. Depending on the membrane electrode assemblies, this process can take hours and even days to complete, which consumes {{a considerable amount}} of hydrogen fuel, leading to a higher operating cost. To provide for accelerated conditioning techniques that can complete the process in a short time period, this paper reviews established conditioning protocols and reported methods to condition PEM single cells and stacks, in an attempt to summarize available information on PEM <b>fuel</b> cell <b>conditioning</b> and the underlying mechanisms.

40|$|The pyrochemical {{conditioning}} of spent {{nuclear fuel}} {{for the purpose of}} final disposal is currently being demonstrated at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). One aspect of this program is to develop a lithium preprocessing stage for the <b>Fuel</b> <b>Conditioning</b> Facility (FCF). Furthermore, a pilot scale of this preprocessing stage is being designed by ANL-W to demonstrate the in situ hot cell capability of this process. In this pilot scale system, fused lithium chloride salt is saturated with molten lithium to form a powerful fluxing compound with a vigorous reducing agent.
