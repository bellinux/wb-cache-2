Children however are exempt from this stage, as they are regarded as innocent and are automatically classed as Muslims (despite religious upbringing). After death they go directly to Heaven, where they are cared for by Abraham.|$|E

25|$|Solar eclipses are {{relatively}} brief events {{that can only}} be viewed <b>in</b> <b>totality</b> along a relatively narrow track. Under the most favorable circumstances, a total solar eclipse can last for 7minutes, 31seconds, and can be viewed along a track that is up to 250km wide. However, the region where a partial eclipse can be observed is much larger. The Moon's umbra will advance eastward at a rate of 1,700km/h, until it no longer intersects the Earth's surface.|$|E
25|$|This was {{an unusual}} East Coast {{outbreak}} both in its sustained intensity and in some of its meteorological specifics. It was noted by Grazulis and other researchers that this outbreak developed {{near the center of}} a large-scale low, in a fashion resembling the 1925 Tri-State tornado. In this outbreak, the damage path was attributed to separate tornadoes, though one storm produced (on an estimated 250+ mile track) a family of 13 large tornadoes, 10 of which produced F3 or F4 damage, which was occasionally connected by swaths of downburst damage. The resulting tornado family, the series of tornadoes <b>in</b> <b>totality</b> is among the longest on record.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the newest}} {{organizational}} structures developed in the 20th century is team and the related concept of team development or team building. In small businesses, the team structure can define the entire organization. Teams can be both horizontal and vertical. While an organization is constituted {{as a set of}} people who synergize individual competencies to achieve newer dimensions, the quality of organizational structure revolves around the competencies of teams <b>in</b> <b>totality.</b> For example, every one of the Whole Foods Market stores, the largest natural-foods grocer in the US developing a focused strategy, is an autonomous profit centre composed of an average of 10 self-managed teams, while team leaders in each store and each region are also a team. Larger bureaucratic organizations can benefit from the flexibility of teams as well. Xerox, Motorola, and DaimlerChrysler are all among the companies that actively use teams to perform tasks.|$|E

500|$|The {{battle of}} Mahidpur between Holkar and the British was fought on 21 December 1817. The charge on the British side {{was led by}} Malcolm himself.

The British East India Company's army lost 800 men but Holkar's force was destroyed. The British East India Company's losses were 800 killed or wounded but Holkar's loss was much larger with about 3,000 killed or wounded. These losses meant Holkar was deprived of any means of rising in arms against the British, and this broke the power of the Holkar dynasty. The battle of Mahidpur proved disastrous for the Maratha fortunes. Henry Durand wrote, [...] "After the battle of Mahidpur not only the Peshwa's but the real influence of the Mahratta States of Holkar and Shinde were dissolved and replaced by British supremacy." [...] Although the power of the Holkar family was broken, the remaining troops remained hostile and a division was retained to disperse them. The ministers made overtures of peace, and on 6 January 1818 the Treaty of Mandeswar was signed; Holkar accepted the British terms <b>in</b> <b>totality.</b> Holkar came under British authority as an independent prince subject to the advice of a British Resident.|$|E

Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India gave the film three out of five stars: [...] "The [...] format of six songs, five fights and loads of entertainment and melodrama makes it impossible to respectably adapt racy Hollywood styled suspense thrillers".

Sify gave the film 2.75 out of five stars: [...] "In 1 Nenokkadine, individual sequences are cool but the same cannot be said if we see it <b>in</b> <b>totality.</b> Apart from Mahesh Babu`s stunning performance, the drive of the film is completely off the track.

[...] Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle gave the film 2.5 out of five stars: [...] "To say it in a line, the film falls short of expectations and disappoints film goers, especially the fans of Mahesh Babu". Kavirayani called Rathnavelu's cinematography its [...] "saving grace", praising the lead pair's performances.

[...] It develops the poet’s thoughts on his relationship with the mass of people living and working in this city until it closes with the poet retiring to his bed. [...] Unlike García Lorca in Poeta en Nueva York or countless other poets, the city is not inhuman, cold, abstract. [...] The emphasis is on the mass of humanity it holds.
