40|$|To {{understand}} the role of hydrated clay minerals in active fault systems, a <b>humidity</b> <b>chamber</b> connected to an X‐ray diffractometer {{was used to determine}} the adsorption of water onto and/or into the crystal structure of smectite. This new type of analysis was carried out under specific temperature and humidity conditions, using powdered clay size fractions (< 2 µm) of rock samples from the San Andreas Fault (USA) and the Nankai Trough (Japan). Pressure cannot be controlled, but does not significantly affect clay swelling at shallow conditions. Air‐dried samples show a discrete smectite phase that swells after traditional ethylene glycolation to an interlayer distance of 1. 5 and 1. 7 nm. Using the <b>humidity</b> <b>chamber,</b> however, the samples show a shorter interlayer distance, between 1. 09 and 1. 54 nm. Based on our analysis, we show that (i) ethylene glycol overestimates the size of the interlayer space, and therefore water content, so is a crude maximum only; (ii) interlayer swelling occurs in smectite clay minerals at all temperatures between 25 and 95 °C; and (iii) particle orientation increases with increasing humidity, indicating a higher mobility of smectite from interlayer hydration. Detailed characterization of the hydration state of smectite under original conditions is critical for understanding of clay‐fluid interaction, the mechanical behavior during fault displacements, and fluid budgets at depth. We propose that <b>humidity</b> <b>chamber</b> experiments should be the new standard procedure to constrain swelling characteristics of natural and synthetic clay minerals.

Five experiments were conducted in the field, in greenhouses, and in <b>humidity</b> <b>chambers.</b> Changes in population size were evaluated in three field plantings, by introducing the bacteria in contamination focal points and observing the weather conditions favoring an outbreak. The dispersion of the bacteria in the field was followed by isolation and Bio-PCR analysis. Two assays were conducted in greenhouses and <b>humidity</b> <b>chambers</b> to evaluate the effect of leaf age on disease expression and the relationship between population level and number of leaf spots. The bacteria multiply intensively when in contact with a compatible host and reach high population sizes, with or without symptoms. The most favorable factor for bacterial multiplication and symptom triggering was water, and its role in the changeover from the epiphytic to the pathogenic phase might be linked to rainfall volume and intensity.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 46 - 47) Permanent press fabrics {{are popular}} {{today because of}} their easy care properties. However, {{it has not been}} verified whether or not this same finish might also act as an antibacterial agent. Therefore, this study investigated the hypothesis that permanent press finishes might stop or curtail bacterial growth on fabrics. Inoculations of two bacteria, E. Coli and B. mega on finished and unfinished fabric samples provided results for a comparative study. Some samples were inoculated and plated immediately; others were inoculated and kept in a <b>humidity</b> <b>chamber</b> for twenty-four hours before plating to simulate storage and climatic conditions; and a third group were inoculated, kept in a <b>humidity</b> <b>chamber</b> for twenty-four hours and then laundered in and according to suggested Launderometer standards. The samples from this last test were then either plated whole or macerated and plated. The Agar Plate Test method (AATCC test standard for detection and evaluation of antibacterial finishes) and the Streak Test method were used for another set of tests. Another segment of the study concerned naturally soiled finished and unfinished fabrics. Small samples of each fabric were sewn in regular clothing, worn one day, and then plated. The permanent press samples that were inoculated and subsequently plated showed little or no growth whereas all the unfinished samples showed considerably increased growth. The permanent press samples that were inoculated and stored for twenty-four hours in a <b>humidity</b> <b>chamber</b> before plating showed no growth while the unfinished samples all exhibited bacterial growth. Of the samples that were inoculated, stored for twenty-four hours in the <b>humidity</b> <b>chamber,</b> washed, and plated whole, all finished samples had no growth but all untreated samples showed growth. Of the washed samples that were macerated, the untreated macerated fibers showed from five to six times more growth than the permanent press samples. The Agar Plate Test and Streak Test both showed that the permanent press samples inhibited bacterial growth whereas the unfinished samples showed no inhibition of growth. On all samples of naturally soiled permanent press fabrics, the majority of samples containing bacterial growth had less growth than the unfinished samples. These results would indicate that the permanent press finish can inhibit some bacterial growth and thus may act concomitantly as an antibacterial finish...|$|E

40|$|Alternaria tagetica {{is capable}} of {{producing}} phytotoxins in vitro. One toxin was identified as zinniol with: bioassays; thin-layer and gas chromatography; staining properties; ultraviolet and mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The identity of the other toxin(s) has not been established. Symptoms similar to those caused by infection developed on detached marigold leaves treated with either of the toxins or synthetic zinniol. The toxins are not host selective. The distribution of zinniol among Alternaria species was studied. Thirty-one isolates of 10 pathogenic Alternaria spp. were tested {{for their ability to}} produce zinniol. Analyses were performed by gas-liquid and thin-layer chromatography. Of the seven pathogenic large-spored, long-beaked species tested A. carthami, A. macrospora, A. porri, A. solani, A. tagetica, and an unnamed isolate from Phaseolus vulgaris pods produced zinniol. A. brassicae, a non-pathogenic isolate of A. zinniae, and three pathogenic species lacking large-spores and long-beaks (A. alternata, A. citri, and A. raphani) did not produce zinniol. The quantity of zinniol produced varied greatly among species, among isolates of a single species, and between trials of the same isolate. All hosts of the Alternaria spp. tested were sensitive to zinniol at 50 to 200 micrograms/ml. Conservation of zinniol in pathogenic large-spored Alternaria spp. may be indicative of its importance in pathogenesis. Light affects the behavior of Alternaria tagetica in vitro and in vivo. In vitro zinniol production occurred only during active fungus growth in the light; in the dark zinniol production occurred primarily after growth stopped. In all filtrates, the quantity of zinniol rapidly declined once zinniol production ceased.
