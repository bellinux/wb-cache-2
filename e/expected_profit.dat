5|$|If {{a player}} is dealt {{a pair of}} eights, the total of 16 is {{considered}} a troublesome hand. In fact, the value 16 {{is said to be}} the worst hand one can have in blackjack. Since sixteen of the other fifty cards have a value of 10 and four have a value of 11, there is a strong chance of getting at least an 18 with either or both split cards. A hand totaling 18 or 19 is much stronger than having a 16. Splitting eights limits one's losses and improves one's hand. Probabilistic research of expected value scenarios shows that by splitting eights one can convert a hand that presents an expected loss to two hands that may present an <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> or a reduced loss, depending on what the dealer is showing. A split pair of eights is expected to win against dealer upcards of 2 through 7 and to lose less against dealer upcards of 8 through ace. If a player hits on a pair of eights, he is expected to lose $52 for a $100 bet. If the player splits the eights, he is expected to lose only $43 for a $100 bet.|$|E
25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} theory {{can be applied}} to all four areas of the marketing mix. Assessments are made by a decision maker on the probabilities of events that determine the profitability of alternative actions where the outcomes are uncertain. Assessments are also made for the profit (utility) for each possible combination of action and event. The decision maker can decide how much research, if any, needs to be conducted in order to investigate the consequences associated with the courses of action under evaluation. This is done before a final decision is made, but {{it should be noted that}} in order to do this costs would be incurred, time used and may overall be unreliable. For each possible action, <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> can be computed, that is a weighted mean of the possible profits, the weights being the probabilities. The decision maker can then choose the action for which the <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> is the highest. The theorem provides a formal reconciliation between judgment expressed quantitatively in the prior distribution and the statistical evidence of the experiment.|$|E

30|$|In {{consideration}} of the equilibrium <b>expected</b> <b>profits</b> of the manufacturers at operational level under different structures and competing intensities, we can examine whether there is any economic incentive for a manufacturer to switch from integrated structure (I) to decentralized structure (D) in an industry where a pure decentralized structure is more profitable than a pure vertically integrated structure. A point which should not be neglected is that the <b>expected</b> <b>profits</b> are not comparably attained from different intensities, but we can only contrast the <b>expected</b> <b>profits</b> in different structures with the same competing intensities.|$|R

25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} analysis {{can also be}} applied to the channel selection process. In order to help provide further information the method can be used that produces results in a profit or loss aspect. Prior information can include costs, <b>expected</b> <b>profit,</b> training expenses and any other costs relevant to the decision as well as managerial experience which can be displayed in a normal distribution. Bayesian decision making under uncertainty lets a marketing manager assess his/her options for channel logistics by computing the most profitable method choice. A number of different costs can be entered into the model that helps to assess the ramifications of change in distribution method. Identifying and quantifying all of the relevant information for this process can be very time consuming and costly if the analysis delays possible future earnings.|$|E
500|$|However, the Permanent Settlement {{was not as}} {{successful}} {{as it had been}} in Bengal. When the Company did not reach the <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> levels, a new system known as the [...] "Village Settlement" [...] was implemented between 1804 and 1814 in the districts of Tinnevely, Trichinopoly, Coimbatore, North Arcot and South Arcot. This involved the leasing of land to the principal cultivators, who in turn leased the land to ryots, or peasant farmers. However, as a village settlement had few differences compared to a permanent settlement, it was eventually discarded. In its place came the [...] "Ryotwari Settlement" [...] implemented by Sir Thomas Munro between 1820 and 1827. According to the new system, land was handed over directly to the ryots who paid their rent directly to the government. The land was assessed and paid revenue fixed by the Government This system had a number of advantages as well as disadvantages for the ryots. In 1833, Lord William Bentinck implemented a new system called the [...] "Mahalwari" [...] or village system under which landlords as well as ryots entered into a contract with the Government.|$|E
500|$|By {{the middle}} of its fiscal year 2008, the company had seen {{significant}} domestic growth {{for the first time}} in several years; for more than a dozen financial quarters, the company showed revenue increases and domestic expansion. During the first half of the calendar year 2008, the company initiated a plan to revitalize its stores with a program to replace or remodel almost all of its North American locations by the beginning of its fiscal year 2009 in July 2008. The renovation plan was credited with helping the company increase same-store sales by as much as 5.4 percent over the previous fiscal year versus its competitors McDonald's and Yum Brand's 3 percent increase, but the total costs of the renovation program affected the company's revenue stream for the final quarters of its 2008 fiscal year. Wall Street analysts had originally projected net income to be approximately 27¢ per share, but the company only reported a 25¢ per share profit. The smaller profit announcement temporarily drove Burger King's stock prices down after the announcement. Despite the lower than <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> and small decline in stock value, Wall Street analysts were upbeat about Burger King's future earnings because it was felt that the renovations would contribute to future profits; one such analyst stated that the renovations would [...] "pay for themselves".|$|E

500|$|Moore {{stated that}} the Dreamcast would need to sell 5 million units in the U.S. {{by the end of}} 2000 in order to remain a viable platform, but Sega {{ultimately}} fell short of this goal with some 3 million units sold. Moreover, Sega's attempts to spur increased Dreamcast sales through lower prices and cash rebates caused escalating financial losses. Instead of an <b>expected</b> <b>profit,</b> for the six months ending September 2000, Sega posted a ¥17.98 billion ($163.11 million) loss, with the company projecting a year-end loss of ¥23.6 billion. This estimate was more than doubled to ¥58.3 billion, and in March 2001, Sega posted a consolidated net loss of ¥51.7 billion ($417.5 million). While the PS2's October 26 U.S. launch was marred by shortages—with only 500,000 of a planned 1 million units shipped due to a manufacturing glitch—this did not benefit the Dreamcast as much as expected, as many disappointed consumers continued to wait for a PS2—while the PSone, a remodeled version of the original PlayStation, was the best-selling console in the U.S. {{at the start of the}} 2000 holiday season. According to Moore, [...] "the PlayStation 2 effect that we were relying upon did not work for us... people will hang on for as long as possible... What effectively happened is the PlayStation 2 lack of availability froze the marketplace". Eventually, Sony and Nintendo held 50 and 35 percent of the US video game market, respectively, while Sega held only 15 percent.

The game was also popular in Italian neighborhoods known as the Italian lottery, and it was known in Cuban communities as bolita ("little ball"). By the early 20th century, the game was associated with poor communities, and could be played for as little as $0.01. The game's attractions to low income and working class bettors were the ability to bet small amounts of money, and that bookies could extend credit to the bettor. In addition, policy winners could avoid paying income tax. Different policy banks would offer different rates, though a payoff of 600 to 1 was typical.
