25|$|The AAGPBL {{operated}} from 1943 to 1954 {{and gave}} over 600 women athletes {{the opportunity to}} play professional baseball and to play it at a level never before attained. The league was conceived by Philip K. Wrigley during World War II. Wrigley, who was in charge both of the Wrigley Company and the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball club, conceived the idea of initiating the <b>innovative</b> <b>project</b> to maintain interest in baseball as the military draft was depleting major-league rosters of first-line players and attendance declined at ballparks around the country. By sending out talent scouts and setting up try-outs in dozens of major cities, Wrigley attracted hundreds of women from all over the United States and Canada who were eager to play in this new professional league. Of these, only 280 were invited to the final tryout at Wrigley Field in Chicago where 60 were chosen to become the first women to ever play professional baseball. League play officially began on May 30, 1943 with the teams Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. Each team was made up of fifteen girls.|$|E

Using the method of comparative analysis {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different models of financing of <b>innovative</b> <b>projects</b> have been studied and the criteria of their expedience for different types of projects and the conditions of their implementation have been formulated. Statistical analysis of the innovation activity of the enterprises processing agricultural products in the Republic of Kazakhstan allowed justifying a conclusion about the need to change the system of financing of <b>innovative</b> <b>projects</b> from the single-investor system to a multi-agent one. The contemporary approaches to financing of <b>innovative</b> <b>projects</b> in the agro-industrial complex of Russia have been analyzed. The importance of integrated <b>innovative</b> agricultural <b>projects</b> has been evaluated in terms of the development of agricultural industries and the economy as a whole.

2500|$|Engineering work {{involved}} a three-year {{commitment from the}} company and incorporated an extensive amount of wind tunnel testing at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The resultant design was a large but aerodynamically [...] "sleek" [...] airliner, incorporating the cockpit in a streamlined glazed [...] "dome".

2500|$|The Netherlands {{has over}} 66 {{wildlife}} crossings (overpasses and ecoducts) {{that have been}} used to protect the endangered European badger, as well as populations of wild boar, red deer, and roe deer. [...] As of 2012, the Veluwe, 1000 square kilometers of woods, heathland and drifting sands, the largest lowland nature area in North Western Europe, contains nine ecoducts, 50 meters wide on average, [...] that are used to shuttle wildlife across highways that transect the Veluwe. [...] The first two ecoducts on the Veluwe were built in 1988 across the A50 when the highway was constructed. Five of the other ecoducts on the Veluwe were built across existing highways, one was built across a two lane provincial road. The two ecoducts across the A50 were used by nearly 5,000 deer and wild boar during a one-year period [...] [...] The Netherlands also boasts the world's longest ecoduct-wildlife overpass called the Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo (sand quarry nature bridge at Crailo) [...] [...] The massive structure, completed in 2006, is 50 m wide and over 800 m long and spans a railway line, business park, river, roadway, and sports complex [...] [...] Monitoring is currently underway to examine the effectiveness of this <b>innovative</b> <b>project</b> combining wildlife protection with urban development.

The Community Intensive Treatment for Youth Program (C.I.T.Y.) was founded in January 1981 by Edward E. Earnest (1943-2005). With the assistance {{and support of the}} Honorable Judge Robert E. Lewis (1927-1993), the city of Gadsden, and the Gadsden City Board of Education, the C.I.T.Y. Program began enrolling students on February 1, 1981. [...] C.I.T.Y. is designed to be a multidimensional program emphasizing habilitation (i.e., equipping at-risk youth on juvenile probation with skills needed {{to meet the demands of}} modern society). [...] Its objectives are: [...] 1. to identify the at-risk youth’s individual strengths and weaknesses, 2. to provide an individualized environment in which the at-risk youth can develop skills, and 3. to alter the natural environment of the at-risk youth so that new acquired skills are nurtured and encouraged. [...] To achieve these objectives, C.I.T.Y. offers academic remediation in reading, math, language; intensive counseling that involves behavior modification, consumer education, and job readiness training. [...] After all objectives have been met, C.I.T.Y. provides GED preparation, return to public school, and placement into technical school, college, job, or military service. [...] In 1983, C.I.T.Y. Program of Etowah County (Gadsden) received the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges Unique and <b>Innovative</b> <b>Project</b> Award. [...] On October 1, 2009, C.I.T.Y.’s name was changed to Special Programming for Achievement Network (S.P.A.N.) and presently functions under the directorship of the Alabama Department of Youth Services.
