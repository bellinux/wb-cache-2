He won 14 NASCAR races in 103 starts in the #29 Holman Moody car from 1965 to 1967. Dick was the hands-down {{favorite}} to win {{rookie of the year}} in 1965, but was ruled ineligible for the award because he was a past champion in IMCA. He was part of the Ford factory team that dominated the season, including the impressive feat of winning the pole position in back to back events at Myrtle Beach and Valdosta, and he nearly won the NASCAR championship in his first full season, settling for second.|$|E
500|$|Flo Rida {{explained}} that he listened to [...] "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)" [...] and similar records growing up {{as a result of}} the varying music genres his seven sisters listened to. Ultimately, his A Aaron Bay-Schuck came up with the idea to sample [...] "You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)" [...] in a song. Bay-Schuck told HitQuarters that he had been listening to a shuffle beat produced by DJ Frank E on a CD of potential beats and had <b>kept</b> <b>hearing</b> in his head the melody of the Dead or Alive song over the top of it. Co-A Mike Caren then brought the sample to the attention of Flo Rida.|$|E

Soon after the aliens hail Enterprise and say, [...] "You will be assimilated, resistance is futile". In response, Archer and Reed board the ship with upgraded pistols, plant explosives, and beam out. Commander Tucker troubleshoots the alien modifications thereby restoring main power to Enterprise. With the transport crippled, Archer realizes the altered crew members are too far gone and orders the transport's destruction. Later, a recovering Phlox informs Archer that while infected he <b>kept</b> <b>hearing</b> a repeating numerical sequence - Earth's coordinates sent somewhere into the Delta Quadrant. Sub-Commander T'Pol states it would take almost 200 years to reach its destination, but Archer remains troubled.|$|E

500|$|Parker said {{following}} the tremendous success of [...] "Mr Hankey, the Christmas Poo", {{much of the}} direct feedback he received for [...] "Damien" [...] was negative.

Parker said, [...] "We <b>kept</b> <b>hearing</b> that word so much. We were like, 'What does that mean, sold out? What did we get and what did we do?'

500|$|In retrospect, Corgan rued the {{decision}} to hire the two percussionists to play alongside Aronoff, instead of having the drummer play along with loops from the album. [...] "That drove Kenny up the wall because Kenny has perfect time and one guy played on top and the other behind. I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he <b>kept</b> <b>hearing</b> things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy," [...] said Corgan in the Adore reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, [...] "he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow {{of what he was}} feeling, so he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd have that same magic as on Aladdin Sane and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style—like honkytonk. I really respect Mike, but to play with him was always challenging; precisely because he is such a supreme musician." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{the initial}} release of Hellig Usvart, a {{publicity}} campaign was launched throughout the black metal community, revolving around Sherlock being credited as [...] "Anonymous". Unsuccessful death-threats {{were given to}} Markus Staiger at Nuclear Blast to reveal {{the identity of the}} anonymous musician who had created the album, although the identity of the musician was later revealed as Jayson Sherlock. Horde as an entity also received death threats for being a Christian band playing black metal. In an interview with Son of Man Records' Erasmus, Sherlock says: [...] "I only ever heard about them [...] second hand. I never personally received any death threats at all, not one. I <b>kept</b> <b>hearing</b> but that was all." [...] Because of the intense, furious anti-satanic themes of [...] "horn crushing" [...] and [...] "goat violence," [...] the album was widely thought to be a parody of the black metal scene. As an evidence of that, on June 6, 1995, the Norwegian newspaper Morgenbladet wrote an article about the phenomenon of Horde, writing: [...] "Horde's album is an abrupt satire of the Norwegian black metal movement." [...] The same article says of Hellig Usvart that [...] "all the obligatory Spinal Tap references are here: [...] Anonymous plays 'Total Apocalyptic Lead Guitar' and 'Cataclysmic Bass Rumblings'. Obviously 'amplified to eleven'." [...] However, Sherlock clears the parody controversy up in a 2006 interview: ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{image from}} his Facebook page depicts Roof wearing a jacket {{decorated}} with two emblems that are popular among American white supremacists: {{the flag of}} the former Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe) and the flag of apartheid-era South Africa. Roof reportedly told friends and neighbors of his plans to kill people, including a plot to attack the College of Charleston, but his claims were not taken seriously. On June 20, a website was discovered called The Last Rhodesian (www.lastrhodesian.com); it had been registered to a [...] "Dylann Roof" [...] on February 9, 2015. The website included what appeared to be an unsigned manifesto containing Roof's opinions of [...] "Blacks", [...] "Jews", [...] "Hispanics" [...] and [...] "East Asians", as well a cache of photos, including an image of Roof posing with a handgun and a Confederate Battle Flag. In this manifesto, Roof says he became [...] "racially aware" [...] {{as a result of the}} 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, writing that because he <b>kept</b> <b>hearing</b> people talk about the incident, he [...] "decided to look him up" [...] and read the Wikipedia article about it. He concluded that George Zimmerman had been in the right, and he was unable to comprehend why the case had gained national attention. He said he then searched for [...] "black on White [...] crime" [...] on Google and found the website of the Council of Conservative Citizens, where he read [...] "pages upon pages" [...] of cases involving black people murdering white people. Roof then writes he has [...] "never been the same since that day".|$|E

Then I fell asleep, but woke with a start, and went to the window for a breath of fresh air. Such a black, breathless night! Nothing to be seen but the twisted, blacker branches; not the faintest stir of leaves, no sound but muffled grunting from the cowhouse, and now and then a faint sigh. I had the queerest feeling of unrest and fear, the last thing to expect on such a night. There is something here that's disturbing; a sort of suppressed struggle. I've never in my life seen anything so irresponsible as this girl, or so uncompromising as the old man; I keep thinking of the way he wiped that violin. It's just as if a spark would set everything in a blaze. There's a menace of tragedy--or--perhaps it's only the heat, and too much of Mother Hopgood's crame....|$|E

Somehow he must manage to see the girl and make her acquaintance. He did not know how it could be contrived, but it could certainly be contrived, and he began to dramatize their meeting on these various terms. It was interesting and it was delightful, and it always came, in its safe impossibility, to his telling her that he loved her, and to her consenting to be his wife. He resolved to take no chance of losing her, but to remain awake, and somehow see her before she could leave the hotel in the morning. The resolution gave him calm; he felt that the affair so far was settled.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHearing aid use and {{satisfaction}} {{can be used}} to analyze the effectiveness of hearing rehabilitation, an issue few explored in Brazilian users. ObjectiveEvaluate hearing aid use dispensed in a publicly-funded health service after one year, the interventions needed and users' satisfaction. MethodProspective observational cross-sectional study. Hearing aid users were invited by telephone to participate in an evaluation of hearing aid use. Results 200 hearing aid users attended the evaluation (47 % of sample loss); 76. 5 % of the subjects were using hearing aids bilaterally, 10. 5 % unilaterally and 13. 0 % none of them; 99. 5 % of users needed some kind of intervention. Users who <b>kept</b> wearing their <b>hearing</b> aids were considered “satisfied”. ConclusionActive search by telephone showed that hearing aid users who attend this publicly-funded health service have difficulties to attend follow-up appointments. Most of the users that came for evaluation <b>kept</b> using their <b>hearing</b> aids; non-use rate was 13 %. Practically all hearing aid users needed some kind of intervention. Despite the high level of satisfaction, those findings did not include users who did not participate in evaluation, which could represent subjects less adhered to the treatment. Results highlighted the need of periodical follow-ups to ensure the effectiveness of auditory rehabilitation...|$|R

5000|$|Sullavan {{suffered}} from the congenital hearing defect otosclerosis that worsened as she aged, making her more and more hearing impaired. Her voice had developed a throatiness because she could hear low tones better than high ones. From early 1957, Sullavan's hearing declined {{so much that she}} was becoming depressed and sleepless and often wandered about all night. She would often go to bed and stay there for days, her only words: [...] "Just let me be, please". Sullavan had <b>kept</b> her <b>hearing</b> problem largely hidden. On January 8, 1960 (one week after Sullavan's death), The New York Post reporter Nancy Seely wrote: [...] "The thunderous applause of a delighted audience—was it only a dim murmur over the years to Margaret Sullavan? Did the poised and confident mien of the beautiful actress mask a sick fear, night after night, that she'd miss an important cue?" [...] In addition to her hearing defect, Sullavan's children, Brooke, and in particular Bridget and Bill, often proved rebellious and contrary. As a result of the divorce from Hayward, the family fell apart. Sullavan felt that Hayward was trying to alienate their children from her. When the children went to California to visit their father they were so spoiled with expensive gifts that, when they returned to their mother in Connecticut, they were deeply discontented with what they saw as a staid lifestyle.|$|R
