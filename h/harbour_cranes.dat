50|$|Between April 2014 and January 2015, an art {{installation}} {{known as}} the Hafenkran or Zürich maritim project was present on the Limmatquai. The installation comprised an old <b>harbour</b> <b>crane</b> from Dresden, together {{with a number of}} bollards and a port horn located on different high-rise buildings in Zürich. The installation proved controversial, and polarized the public and the political establishment of Zürich.|$|R
25|$|In the 1870s, Bristol Docks {{was going}} through a period of {{expansion}} and modernisation in the face of increasing competition from other ports. Iron-hulled ships were becoming larger, cargoes heavier, and there had already been investment in building a railway line along the <b>harbour</b> quay. <b>Crane</b> capacity was limited though – none of the <b>harbour's</b> 17 <b>cranes</b> being able to lift more than 3tons.|$|R
50|$|Bingen (Rhein) Stadt station lies 2 km farther east, {{right across}} from the {{historical}} <b>harbour</b> <b>crane.</b> This station is only important for local transport. Furthermore, {{there is also a}} stop in Bingen-Gaulsheim. The reason that two railway stations arose in Bingen is historical. The main railway station was originally a Prussian border station built by the Rhenish Railway Company on its West Rhine Railway, while the station in town belonged to the Hessian Ludwig Railway.|$|R

50|$|The five cables {{arrived in}} the Port of Vancouver, Washington, USA on June 9 and were shipped to Whistler via train, {{arriving}} on June 16. Vancouver, Washington was used because it owns the largest mobile <b>harbour</b> <b>crane</b> on the West Coast of North America. To handle the 90-tonne reels, a German-made Goldhofer heavy-haulage trailer and tractor made its way from Montreal, QC to Whistler {{to take care of}} the transport from the train yard up the mountain. The Goldhofer trailer has four sections with six axles, each. Each axle has eight wheels. The trailer also features a hydraulic sliding system, which enabled the reels to be unloaded from the railcars in Whistler without a crane. Since there is no crane to lift each reel onto the truck, this trailer features sliding steel plates that essentially scoop the load from the train and set it onto the trailer deck. The five cables were trucked up Blackcomb Mountain for pulling across the valley starting June 19. Their entire 18000 mi journey from Switzerland to the top of Blackcomb Mountain was coordinated by OmniTrans Corporation.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the very}} high traffic the {{container}} terminal is experiencing, the BCTC reached {{an agreement with the}} port authority to utilize the older quays 12, 13, and 14 for handling smaller container ships when quay 16 is occupied. This allows the container terminal to process up to 1,200,000 TEU per year and reduce vessel wait times. Container ships that are processed at these older quays as well as quay 15 have their containers loaded and unloaded by two mobile <b>harbour</b> <b>cranes</b> manufactured by Gottwald Port Technology.|$|E
50|$|Canon's Wharf {{was once}} one of the busiest quays in the docks, with its own branch of the Bristol <b>Harbour</b> Railway, <b>cranes</b> and a goods shed. The area was also the {{location}} of the city gas works. With the decline of industry throughout the 20th century Canon's Marsh was cleared to make way for urban renewal. Due to pollution, however, the gas works remained derelict for several years. The area is now the location of At-Bristol, the South West offices of Lloyds TSB bank, a campus of City of Bristol College and several bars, restaurants, apartment buildings and offices.|$|R
40|$|For the {{operation}} of boom cranes a significant high level of experience is needed to achieve {{a large amount of}} handled containers. Therefore, automation systems with anti-sway abilities for boom cranes were developed to increase the handling rate especially for inexperienced crane operators. In the paper, an optimal control approach is presented as an alternative to feedback control systems. After deriving the nonlinear dynamic model, the anti-sway problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained optimal control problem. The numerical solution method for this optimal control problem is presented. The results are illustrated at measurements for the <b>harbour</b> mobile <b>crane</b> LIEBHERR LHM 400...|$|R
5000|$|Once {{work had}} progressed {{sufficiently}} {{on the support}} structures, a giant [...] "creeper crane" [...] was erected {{on each side of}} the <b>harbour.</b> These <b>cranes</b> were fitted with a cradle, and then used to hoist men and materials into position to allow for erection of the steelwork. To stabilise works while building the arches, tunnels were excavated on each shore with steel cables passed through them and then fixed to the upper sections of each half-arch to stop them collapsing as they extended outwards.Arch construction itself began on 26 October 1928. The southern end of the bridge was worked on ahead of the northern end, to detect any errors and to help with alignment. The cranes would [...] "creep" [...] along the arches as they were constructed, eventually meeting up in the middle. In less than two years, on Tuesday, 19 August 1930, the two halves of the arch touched for the first time. Workers riveted both top and bottom sections of the arch together, and the arch became self-supporting, allowing the support cables to be removed. On 20 August 1930 the joining of the arches was celebrated by flying the flags of Australia and the United Kingdom from the jibs of the creeper cranes.|$|R
50|$|After Eteläsatama was {{assigned}} solely to passenger traffic, the <b>harbour</b> <b>cranes</b> {{and the track}} were dismantled in 1972. When the Finnjet was built, there was a public presentation {{of a plan to}} put the harbour rail to passenger use in a similar way as in Turku, where passenger trains go to the harbour. These plans were not realised, as {{the first part of this}} line was dismantled from the front of the Finnjet terminal in Katajanokka in 1977. The cargo traffic to Katajanokka finally ended on May 1, 1980.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} {{construction}} cranes were invented by the Ancient Greeks and were powered by men or beasts of burden, such as donkeys. These cranes {{were used for}} the construction of tall buildings. Larger cranes were later developed, employing the use of human treadwheels, permitting the lifting of heavier weights. In the High Middle Ages, <b>harbour</b> <b>cranes</b> were introduced to load and unload ships and assist with their construction - some were built into stone towers for extra strength and stability. The earliest cranes were constructed from wood, but cast iron, iron and steel took over with the coming of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
50|$|Stationary <b>harbour</b> <b>cranes</b> are {{considered}} a new development of the Middle Ages; its earliest use being documented for Utrecht in 1244. The typical harbour crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double treadwheels. There were two types: wooden gantry cranes pivoting on a central vertical axle and stone tower cranes which housed the windlass and treadwheels with only the jib arm and roof rotating. These cranes were placed on docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like see-saws, winches and yards. Slewing cranes which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340.|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear dynamic {{interactions}} in <b>harbour</b> quayside <b>cranes</b> {{due to a}} two-to-one internal resonance between the lowest bending mode of the deformable boom and the in-plane pendular mode of the container are investigated. To this end, a three-dimensional model of container cranes accounting for the elastic interaction between the crane boom and the container dynamics is proposed. The container is modelled as a three-dimensional rigid body elastically suspended through hoisting cables from the trolley moving along the crane boom modelled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam. The reduced governing equations of motion are obtained through the Euler-Lagrange equations employing the boom kinetic and stored energies, derived via a Galerkin discretisation based on the mode shapes of the two-span crane boom used as trial functions, and the kinetic and stored energies of the rigid body container and the elastic hoisting cables. First, conditions for the onset of internal resonances between the boom and the container are found. A higher order perturbation treatment of the Taylor expanded equations of motion in the neighbourhood of a two-to-one internal resonance between the lowest boom bending mode and the lowest pendular mode of the container is carried out. Continuation of the fixed points of the modulation equations together with stability analysis yields a rich bifurcation behaviour, which features Hopf bifurcations. It is shown that consideration of higher order terms (cubic nonlinearities) beyond the quadratic geometric and inertia nonlinearities breaks the symmetry of the bifurcation equations, shifts the bifurcation points and the stability ranges, and leads to bifurcations not predicted by the low order analysis...|$|R
40|$|In many tasks {{body parts}} {{have to be}} held against gravity for {{prolonged}} periods of time, often in positions other than the usual upright sitting or standing. Because the object that is worked on with hands and or tools cannot be repositioned or reoriented, the worker must adapt, not seldom leading to awkward postures. Lying on the back or lying half flat/half seated looking upwards is seen in machine maintenance. Lying on the chest, face down is seen in agriculture where workers manually plant, weed or harvest. Prolonged forward-bent sitting or standing, is observed {{in the work of}} <b>harbour</b> and tower <b>crane</b> operators, and of surgeons. In several areas harnesses or other supportive means are applied. We have indications that users perceive discomfort from the supportive means. They may also feel restrained in the movements they need for correct task execution. The available ergonomic literature reveals little or no scientific evidence about supportive measures and their possible adverse effects. In a poster we will present further examples, indicate problems that might arise with types of body support and discuss relevant aspects that should be put into further research and innovative development. Our aim is to initiate an international project on this matter...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{construction}} cranes {{where the}} work speed {{was determined by}} the relatively slow progress of the masons, harbor cranes usually featured double treadwheels to speed up loading. The two treadwheels whose diameter is estimated to be 4 m or larger were attached to each side of the axle and rotated together. Their capacity was 2-3 tons which apparently corresponded to the customary size of marine cargo. Today, according to one survey, fifteen treadwheel harbor cranes from pre-industrial times are still extant throughout Europe. Some <b>harbour</b> <b>cranes</b> were specialised at mounting masts to newly built sailing ships, such as in Danzig, Cologne and Bremen. Beside these stationary cranes, floating cranes which could be flexibly deployed in the whole port basin came into use by the 14th century.|$|E
