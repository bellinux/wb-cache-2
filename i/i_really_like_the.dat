The trio {{performed the}} song later that month {{to promote the}} release of the New Xbox Experience, as part of a set list that included their singles [...] "Push the Button" [...] and [...] "About You Now". They performed [...] "No Can Do" [...] on 18 July 2009 at Ponty’s Big Weekend, which was held at Ynysangharad Park in Pontypridd, Wales, and dedicated the performance to Michael Jackson who died a month earlier. Buchanan named [...] "No Can Do" [...] one of her favourite songs from the Sugababes' career, stating: [...] "I love 'No Can Do' because it's such a different sound for us. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> whole old-school, laid-back sound and it's got a kind of Jackson 5 feel to it which I love." ...|$|E
500|$|Nina was {{initially}} {{meant to be}} a [...] "bad girl", but the writers rewrote the part for Goodrem, and the character became a [...] "painfully shy schoolgirl" [...] who gets a job in the Coffee Shop. The Age described Nina as the [...] "quintessential girl next door". Goodrem described her character as [...] "a quiet, unassuming type of girl", who did not think anything of her amazing gift. When Goodrem was asked if she was similar to Nina, she replied [...] "I think I am in some ways and in some ways I'm not. Nina's very shy, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> character Nina but I think she'd probably walk out of a room and I'd probably chat all day I think that's probably the difference, she'd sneak out of a room and I'd stay!" [...] The BBC agreed with Goodrem and said that Nina would not say [...] "boo to a goose" [...] and would flee if anyone looked her way.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} {{process of}} the album eventually lasted from January to August 2003, with an additional mixing and mastering period lasting until October. Previous Blink-182 sessions were recorded in three months. The band stated that being in a studio longer than three months gave them the luxury of experimenting with different methods of writing, playing, and recording. The band built each song with a minute attention to detail. Hoppus described the studio as a [...] "musical laboratory": over 70 guitars, 30 amps, [...] "30 or 40" [...] different snare drums, up to six drum kits, various keyboards, turntables, and pianos {{were used in the}} album's production, a lot of which came from Finn's personal collection. Barker was responsible for the turntables and a copy of Pink Floyd's The Wall. The group also enlisted the help of James Guthrie, an engineer behind The Wall. The trio also sent The Cure frontman Robert Smith the bed track of [...] "All of This" [...] in hopes he would contribute; Smith makes a guest appearance and recorded his parts in England. The three initially believed their legitimacy would be in question due to the humor-oriented nature of their earlier recordings, to which Smith responded, [...] "Nobody knows what kind of songs you are going to write in the future and nobody knows the full potential of any band. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> music you sent me." [...] The band also collaborated with DJ Shadow and Dan the Automator, and Barker desired to work with The Neptunes. Jerry Finn, who had produced the previous two Blink-182 albums and the Box Car Racer album, returned to produce Blink-182, which would be his final contribution with the band.|$|E

They {{told me to}} go make a version that I would play out in one of my sets versus {{focusing}} on a radio-friendly mix. That was refreshing and I think that being able to fully approach it with doing what was best for the track for club play really made this remix rock.|$|R

2500|$|In the 1999 Swedish film , Floberg {{played the}} role of Claes, one of two {{fishermen}} who rescues Polish Irena, played by Izabella Scorupco, from the water. The two fishermen later gets in trouble, as it turns out that Irena is being chased by members of the russian mafia. This was the fifth time Floberg played in a film directed by Erik Gustavson, who praised him: [...] " [...] is my Robert De Niro. Our fifth film together. It has always gone well". Floberg, on the other hand, dryly commented: [...] "Yes, I got a phone call [...] this time too". In an interview with Verdens Gang, he elaborated on his relationship with Gustavson: [...] "We have a really good understanding. We talk a lot in codes, and save a lot of time. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> way Erik works". Floberg also expressed his satisfaction with playing a [...] "good guy" [...] for once, humorously acknowledging that he is probably considered Norway's [...] "number one movie-psycho". Co-star Scorupco, on the other hand, characterized Floberg as charming, and [...] "easy to fall in love with". In Misery Harbour, a Scandinavian/Canadian collaboration from the same year, Floberg returned to playing a negative character. He received critical acclaim for his depiction of the arrogant literary critic Johan Hoeg, being described as [...] "brilliant", and [...] "taking on the role (...) with razor-sharp spitefulness".|$|E

[...] "T.W.L" [...] was written for Kanjani Eight {{to be used for}} the Shin-chan anime and upon news of hearing that Kitagawa had penned the song for them, there was a mutual excitement among the band. Tadayoshi Ohkura had said, [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> song, T.W.L, that {{was written by}} Yuzu's Kitagawa Yujin.

Shota Yasuda had said, [...] " [...] I don't know the meaning behind the title for T.W.L. I don't know the reason (behind it), hahaha! When I first heard the song, I was able to honestly get it. I understood the lyrics. [...] " [...] He later stated on the DVD making that T.W.L stood for the word [...] "towel".

I only spoke to Carter and that's probably, <b>like,</b> one of <b>the</b> hardest calls I had to make and just talked to him and he was, like, [...] "Well, fuck man, it's a bummer, but it's, like, you gotta do what you gotta do." ...|$|R

Laura Bailey, who {{was the voice of}} Rayne in the BloodRayne games, was asked at her panel at Anime Boston 2007 what her thoughts were on the film adaptation, and said [...] "Oh God, that movie sucked. And that movie was so bad. I saw it on The Movie Channel and I couldn't even get through 20 minutes of it! It was so bad and it was kinda sad that they took that because <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> games." ...|$|R
2500|$|In June 2011, it was {{announced}} that Madjo had joined League One side Stevenage on a free transfer. He signed a one-year contract with the club. Stevenage manager Graham Westley had previously tried to sign Madjo ahead of the 2008–09 season, but the player instead opted to seek a move abroad. On signing for Stevenage, Madjo said [...] "I have met the players at Stevenage, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> team and the way they looked after me when I arrived. I’m really looking forward to the new season and hope to score lots of goals for my new club". In July 2011, Westley stated that the signing of Madjo had been held up by an [...] "administrative hitch", and that there was a delay in transferring his registration — [...] "There are a couple of issues that need sorting out with his former club, but I'm hopeful that will resolve itself in the coming days". Stevenage announced that they had received international clearance for Madjo on 22 July. Madjo was not involved in any of Stevenage's first ten fixtures of the 2011–12 season, although was an unused substitute in a 4–3 defeat to Peterborough United in the League Cup on 9 August 2011. After scoring in a reserve match against Oxford United, Madjo made his first appearance of the season three days later, on 24 September, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 1–0 loss to Carlisle United at Brunton Park.|$|E
2500|$|Upon arrival, Bree {{was shown}} as a polite and sensitive, well trained doctor, sharply {{contrasting}} her sister Brooke (Beth Allen). The character made friends quickly and appeared overly generous. However, as the character developed, {{it was revealed}} she too had a nasty side and {{was a lot more}} similar to Brooke than originally thought. Blampied enjoyed playing the personality change, labelling it as; [...] "making a great descent" [...] and stating; [...] "It's a massive change from how the character arrived and through her relationship with Brooke and Vinnie, it goes haywire. I'm looking forward to the challenge of how to justify those decisions she makes." [...] Bree's manipulative persona was blamed on her [...] "tumultuous upbringing" [...] which saw her be fostered by several families before being adopted at 10. As a result, she suffered from self-consciousness. Blampied enjoyed playing such a complex character, stating: [...] "It's definitely a lot more interesting than always being the nice guy because you do get to say and do some things you would never do and it's the furthest thing from my personal character and demeanor, so it is quite a turnaround." [...] Blampied went on to explain her mixed opinions of Bree: [...] "I obviously don't agree with what she's doing. Sometimes I read the script and go, 'Why are you doing that? There are a hundred easier ways to do that.' I have days where I really don't like Bree and what she's doing." [...] The character has been described as [...] "conniving" [...] and [...] "scheming". Blampied did not at first realise how manipulative Bree was to become and when she realised the extent to which writers were pushing her antagonistic characterisation, she described it as [...] "daunting". However Blampied had been warned, [...] "Someone told me, if you're on Shortland Street, always play your character as if you have a secret – because you will have a secret!" [...] To portray Bree's penultimate breakdown, Blampied researched borderline personality disorder and severe narcissism. Blampied enjoyed how Bree was portrayed in her final scene, stating: [...] "We don't often see Bree's vulnerable side side and when we do she's still being manipulative and deceitful ... <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> way she ends up because {{there is an element of}} real sadness to it ... when she realises how wrong she's been." [...] Blampied cared for her character and hoped for an uneventful future for Bree, [...] "I'd like to see her get well, hold down a job and maybe even get into a relationship. Life is hard for her and always has been. I care about Bree and I know that sounds like a weird thing to say." [...] Describing Bree upon her return, Blampied stated, [...] "She's still mentally very fragile, and her manipulative tendencies are most definitely still at the surface", but affirmed, [...] "she's a lot more aware now though".|$|E

5000|$|Helge {{started playing}} guitar {{at the age}} of 13 and soon became obsessed with the {{instrument}} and music in general. To quote Engelke, [...] "I listened to everything that was around. From Yes to Genesis, from T Rex to Mott the Hoople, from Deep Purple to Led Zeppelin. My favorite band was - and in some concerns still is - Rainbow. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> mixture of heavy rock guitars with strong vocal melodies and powerful drums." [...] The young musician was a fan of both Uli Jon Roth (then Ulrich Roth) and Michael Schenker so his early guitar preferences were the Fender Stratocaster and the Gibson Flying V.|$|R
5000|$|On October 28, 2011, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim {{announced}} Dipoto {{would be}} their next general manager, replacing Tony Reagins. Angels' owner Arte Moreno said that [...] "one {{of the reasons we}} hired Jerry is that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> way he viewed baseball analytics." [...] However, Dipoto and manager Mike Scioscia disagreed regarding the use of analytics in baseball decisions, and a rift developed between the two when Dipoto fired Mickey Hatcher from the role of the team's hitting coach. Despite rumors that the Angels might replace either Dipoto or Scioscia after the 2013 season, Moreno announced that both would return to the Angels for the 2014 season.|$|R
5000|$|Jung Joon-ho took on {{the dual}} role of Myung-su and Hyung-su to further his skills as an actor, and said, [...] "When I read <b>the</b> script, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> story and wanted to star in the film... I begged the {{director}} to choose me". He prepared himself by studying the performances of other actors playing double roles in films, such as Jeon Do-yeon in My Mother, the Mermaid and Park Shin-yang in The Big Swindle. Prior to {{the launch of the}} film, Jung noted that he focused more on the character of Myung-su, feeling that the personality of Hyung-su was expressed less fully than he intended.|$|R

All the girls were sweating and working hard…they all gave 100 % effort and tried very hard (no one gave up). Something new and exciting to do!” (LL-Nov. 1, 2011). Additionally, the youth played lacrosse, went swimming, and skating. The following quotations highlight the youth’s perceptions of the variety of activities: “I <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> games and how sometimes we would go places—Oh <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> swimming activity which was really fun” (Y- 1) and “I liked soccer, racquet hockey—oh and huckle buckle.

5000|$|... "I {{just did}} my best to depict what I thought the film should look <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> idea. <b>I</b> didn't think the film would ever get made. My {{impression}} was it was too expensive. There wouldn't be enough of an audience. It's just too complicated. But George knew {{a lot of things that}} I didn't know." [...] —McQuarrie on Star Wars. Impressed with his work, director and filmmaker George Lucas met with him to discuss his plans for a space-fantasy film. Several years later, in 1975, Lucas commissioned McQuarrie to illustrate several scenes from the script of the film, Star Wars. McQuarrie designed many of the film's characters, including Darth Vader, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO and drew many concepts for the film's sets.|$|R

Says Gahan, [...] "There was loads of names being thrown at us (to produce Depeche Mode's next album after Songs of Faith and Devotion), but in the end we picked (Simenon) because Martin (Gore) and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> Gavin Friday album that he did.

5000|$|Topher Grace as Edwin, {{a doctor}} who {{does not seem to}} belong amongst the group of {{hardened}} killers until he reveals that he is a psychopathic murderer. Grace was dubious about taking the role when he read the script, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> first Predator, but all the sequels haven't been as good. Then when I read this, I thought, 'What Aliens was to Alien, this is to Predator. Because Predator never really got its due; it never really got that sequel." [...] He compared Antal's approach to that of James Cameron, director of Aliens; remaining faithful to the original work but taking the concepts in slightly different directions. Grace performed some of his own stunts, including jumping off a waterfall.|$|R
