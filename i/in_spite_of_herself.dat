25|$|Set in two spaces, one {{of which}} {{represents}} the personal life of Marilyn Monroe (1926-1962) and the other which depicts moments of American political and civic life, the story interweaves the myth and decline of the movie star up to her mysterious death, with accounts of significant past events: the Korean war, the McCarthy era investigations, the prosecution of Wilhelm Reich, and the lectures of Timothy Leary {{on the use of}} psychedelic drugs. Marilyn is seen as an involuntary victim of the mass culture of her time, a figure only superficially serene and optimistic, a heroine <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> whose contradictory personality is represented in twelve scenes, equally distributed in the two acts.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Cynthia {{made her}} {{recording}} début with a rendition of [...] "Those Were the Days", which as produced by McCartney {{had been a}} number one hit for Mary Hopkin in 1968. [...] It failed to chart. Whilst living in Normandy, an exhibition of her drawings and paintings were displayed at Portobello Road's KDK Gallery in 1999. [...] By the 1990s she was appearing at some Beatles conventions, but appeared ambivalent about the practice. [...] At times she maintained she was moving {{on with her life}} and putting her Beatles past behind her and at other times seemed to embrace continued interest in that past as inevitable. The Daily Telegraph said in a 1999 profile, [...] "In essence, she is a suburban woman who – almost <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> – got caught up {{with one of the most}} extraordinary men of modern times. More than 30 years since her marriage to John Lennon ended, she is as entangled as ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing Cordelia's {{relationship}} with Xander, Carpenter says, [...] "A lot of Cordy's conflict, {{and a lot}} of who she is, comes out around Xander. Because she is in love with him <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> or in spite of him. I have my best moments with [...]" [...] However, her character's growing involvement with Buffy and her friends caused the actress some concern; [...] "I wasn't sure how I felt about it, because I didn't want to lose my edge. I didn't want her to be nice; I didn't want her to change because that's who she is." [...] Carpenter's challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia, and she explains, [...] "That's why I enjoy playing her so much. She's got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her? But I [...] not to lose her edge, her honesty." [...] Carpenter claims that Cordelia's [...] "rough edges" [...] made for difficult experiences with fans, who expected her to be snobby like her character. Charisma continually pleaded to get to slay a vampire, which the writers let her do in her final Buffy appearance, [...] "Graduation Day, Part Two".|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> declaring <b>herself</b> as a Porno Actress at that time, her {{films were}} not on sale. Months later she {{appeared}} in the Spanish mainstream film Torrente 3: El Protector, directed by Santiago Segura,.|$|R

25|$|Theodore Schroeder, a free-speech {{lawyer from}} New York with an amateur {{interest}} in psychology, {{became interested in}} Ida Craddock's case a decade after her death. He began researching her life, and collected {{a large amount of}} her letters, diaries, manuscripts, and other printed materials. Although he never met Craddock he speculated that she had taken at least two human lovers, <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> Craddock <b>herself</b> insisting that she had only ever had intercourse with Soph, her spirit husband.|$|R
500|$|The {{producers}} {{were looking}} for someone who had a [...] "Paris Hilton quality" [...] to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. A lot of women auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace. She was written to be a bitch in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. The producers thought it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. They {{came up with the idea}} for them to be unrelated stepsiblings, who have a romantic encounter, which became the twist for their backstory. When Boone is killed at the end of season one, it forces Shannon into a more adult existence on the Island. Grace noted Boone is [...] "the only person that ever really knew and loved Shannon, <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself.</b> Of course, losing him, especially with so much left unsaid and unresolved, will change her irrevocably." [...] This freed her up to develop her relationship with Sayid. Naveen Andrews, who plays Sayid, came up with the idea for Shannon and Sayid relationship. He thought, [...] "What would really shock Middle-America? What if Sayid was to have a relationship with a woman that looked like Miss America? The most unlikely pairing… to come completely from left field." [...] This pairing made Shannon [...] "less flighty... more of a person to be reckoned with." [...] According to Lost producer Carlton Cuse, [...] "The relationships [...] expect on the show are not necessarily the ones that we [...] necessarily are going to give you, but we want to try to find ways in which characters that you don't expect to kind of connect to one another to connect in ways that are kind of surprising." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 2012 interview, Swift {{remarked that}} <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> keeping <b>herself</b> [...] "as educated and {{informed}} as possible", {{she does not}} discuss politics, fearing that it might influence other people. Swift has spent time with the Kennedy family and has spoken of her admiration for Ethel Kennedy. Swift is also a feminist. She has spoken out against LGBT discrimination. Following the 2008 murder of Larry King, she recorded a GLSEN PSA to combat hate crimes. On {{the first anniversary of}} King's death, Swift told Seventeen that her parents taught her [...] "never to judge others based on whom they love, what color their skin is, or their religion". The music video for Swift's anti-bullying song [...] "Mean" [...] deals in part with homophobia in high schools; the video was nominated for an MTV VMA social activism award in 2011. The New York Times believes she is part of [...] "a new wave of young (and mostly straight) women who are providing the soundtrack for a generation of gay fans coming to terms with their identity in a time of turbulent and confusing cultural messages".|$|R
