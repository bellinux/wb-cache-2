50|$|Loss of {{sequences}} {{from human}} chromosome 10q {{has been associated}} with the progression of human cancers. The gene DMBT1 was originally <b>isolated</b> <b>based</b> on its deletion in a medulloblastoma cell line. DMBT1 is expressed with transcripts of 6.0, 7.5, and 8.0 kb in fetal lung and with one transcript of 8.0 kb in adult lung, although the 7.5 kb transcript has not been characterized. The DMBT1 protein is a glycoprotein containing multiple scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains separated by SRCR-interspersed domains (SID). Transcript variant 2 (8.0 kb) has been shown to bind surfactant protein D independently of carbohydrate recognition. This indicates that DMBT1 may not be a classical tumor suppressor gene, but rather {{play a role in the}} interaction of tumor cells and the immune system.|$|E
50|$|The {{nucleoside}} diphosphate (NDP) kinases (EC 2.7.4.6) are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze transfer of gamma-phosphates, via a phosphohistidine intermediate, between nucleoside and dioxynucleoside tri- and diphosphates. The enzymes {{are products of}} the nm23 gene family, which includes NME4. The first nm23 gene, nm23-H1 (NME1), was <b>isolated</b> <b>based</b> on its reduced expression in a highly metastatic murine melanoma cell line and was proposed to be a metastasis suppressing gene. The human equivalent was obtained by cDNA library screening using the murine gene as a probe and found to be homologous to the Drosophila awd gene. A second human gene, nm23-H2 (NME2), encoding a protein 88% identical to nm23-H1, was subsequently isolated. Both genes were localized on 17q21.3 and their gene products were formerly identified as the A and B subunits of NDP kinases. In mammals, functional NDP kinases are heterohexamers of the A and B monomers, which can combine at variable ratios to form different types of hybrids. These enzymes are highly expressed in tumors as compared with normal tissues. In some cell lines and in certain solid tumors, decreased expression of NME1 is associated with increased metastatic potential; moreover, when transfected into very aggressive cell lines, such as human breast carcinoma, NME1 decreased the metastatic potential. A third human gene, DR-nm23 (NME3), was identified and found to share high sequence similarity with the NME1 and NME2 genes. It is highly expressed in blast crisis transition of chronic myeloid leukemia. When overexpressed by transfection, NME3 suppressed granulocyte differentiation and induced apoptosis of myeloid precursor cells.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} study of the optical absorption spectra of DNA bases and base pairs, carried out by means of time dependent density functional theory. The spectra for the <b>isolated</b> <b>bases</b> are compared to available theoretical and experimental data and {{used to assess the}} accuracy of the method {{and the quality of the}} exchange-correlation functional. Our approach turns out to be a reliable tool to describe the response of the nucleobases. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the impact of hydrogen bonding and pi-stacking in the calculated spectra for both Watson-Crick base pairs and Watson-Crick stacked assemblies. We show that the reduction of the UV absorption intensity (hypochromicity) for light polarized along the base-pair plane depends strongly on the type of interaction. For light polarized perpendicular to the basal plane, the hypochromicity effect is reduced, but another characteristic is found, namely a blue shift of the optical spectrum of the base-assembly compared to that of the <b>isolated</b> <b>bases.</b> The use of optical tools as fingerprints for the characterization of the structure (and type of interaction) is extensively discussed...|$|R

30|$|Immunoaffinity {{exploits}} {{interactions between}} antibodies and surface proteins of EVs to isolate EVs. Antibodies specific to surface proteins of EVs (e.g., CD 9, CD 81, CD 63, TSG 101, Alix) {{are linked to}} chemically-modified or protein-coated beads, and capture EVs by binding to these proteins [4, 62, 63]. EVs <b>isolated</b> <b>based</b> on immunoaffinity have different characteristics than those <b>isolated</b> <b>based</b> on size. Size-based separation cannot distinguish among subpopulations of EVs. For example, {{if the goal is}} to distinguish the CD 81 + subpopulation of EVs from the CD 63 + subpopulation, immunoaffinity is recommended [64]. Many studies have discovered EV biogenesis and subpopulations by exploiting the interaction of surface proteins with specific antibodies. Tetraspanin-specific antibodies are common in immunoaffinity [65]; for example, CD 81 is internalized more slowly than CD 9 [66]. ELISA with anti-CD 81 antibody has been used to quantify EGFR level in plasma EVs from lung cancer patients. The EGFR exosomal proteins are possible diagnostic biomarkers in immunoaffinity methods [65].|$|E

The first group (‘Group 1 ’) was composed of area 17 units <b>isolated</b> <b>based</b> on response to a bar with optimal length and orientation. The second group (‘Group 2 ’) was composed of area 17 units <b>isolated</b> <b>based</b> on response to luminance modulation of a uniform surface patch over its RF. The third group (‘Group 3 ’) was composed of area 18 units isolated on the same criteria as Group 2. Left, Single-unit response rate modulation to the border and uniform surface of the Real condition. The response modulation index (‘MI’) was quantified by fitting the peri-stimulus time histogram with a sinusoid, calculating the contrast ratio (max – min) / (max + min), and correcting for bias from differences in spike count (see Hung et al. 2002).   Due to the sinusoidal fit, {{in some cases the}} contrast ratio can exceed 1. Group responses are shown in black. A subset of these units were tested with both ‘Border at RF ’ and ‘Surface at RF ’ conditions (white bars and scatterplot at Right). Error bars indicate s. e. m. The designation of these groups are solely based on selection criteria. The similarity of Group 1 and 2 responses suggests that they may actually comprise a single population despite the difference in selection criteria. Thus, the results of this paper should be interpreted in terms of the context-dependent changes in the properties of neurons as they are stimulated by luminance edges and regions of uniform luminance.

40|$|International audienceAn <b>isolated</b> <b>base</b> {{station is}} a base station having no {{connection}} to a traditional core network. To provide services to users, an <b>isolated</b> <b>base</b> station is co-located with an entity providing the same functionalities as the traditional core network, referred to as Local EPC.

In this work, we tackle the Local EPC placement problem in the network, to determine with which of the base stations the Local EPC must be co-located. We propose a novel centrality metric, flow centrality, which measures the capacity of a node to receive {{the total amount of}} flows in the network. We show that co-locating the Local EPC with the base station having the maximum flow centrality maximizes the total amount of traffic the Local EPC can receive from all base stations, under certain capacity and load distribution constraints.
