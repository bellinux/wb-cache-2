I think <b>everybody</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{be the one who}} got to do it." [...] In an interview with E! Online, actress Marcia Cross jokingly said of the kiss scene, [...] "I'm a little jealous that I'm not involved. What is going on?" [...] Delany said she did not know if the character would become a lesbian permanently, because the story lines change so often in Desperate Housewives, but that series creator Marc Cherry [...] "is interested in playing the complexity of that".
