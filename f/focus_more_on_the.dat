5|$|Ayer, who {{had written}} several police {{procedural}} films previously, wanted the film to <b>focus</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> friendship between partners and honest police work rather than corruption. Gyllenhaal, Peña, and other cast members underwent an intensive training program to prepare for their roles as police officers. Filming took place in Los Angeles in August 2011 with a budget of $7 million.|$|E
5|$|A {{television}} series called The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries ran from 1977 to 1979 on American Broadcasting Company (ABC). It initially starred 24-year-old Pamela Sue Martin as Nancy. For the first season, episodes featuring Nancy alternated with episodes featuring the Hardy Boys. The stories were new stories {{based on the}} original stories, with Nancy solving mysteries with her friends George and Ned. Beginning in the second season, {{the format of the}} series changed to <b>focus</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hardy Boys, with Nancy Drew primarily appearing as a guest star in several crossover story lines; Martin left the series midway through the second season and was replaced by 19-year-old Janet Louise Johnson for the final few episodes. The series continued for a third season as The Hardy Boys Mysteries, dropping Nancy Drew completely, but the series was eventually cancelled midway through the season.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a failed}} bid {{to win the}} 2001 Alberta championship, the team then boycotted the Brier, as {{prominent}} curling teams of the day wanted to <b>focus</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> World Curling Tour, while the Canadian Curling Association scheduled events conflicting with major WCT events. In the meantime, however, Martin still had his sights set on an Olympic championship. The team went to the 2001 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials and finished first after the round robin with a 7–2 win-loss record. That gave the team a bye to the finals, which Martin won by defeating Kerry Burtnyk with a score of 8–7.|$|E

5|$|Gary {{uses the}} novel {{as a vehicle to}} {{denounce}} both racism and the activists supporting African-American rights, including his own ex-wife and Marlon Brando. He also examines whether human responses to situations, including racism, are learned social behavior and whether they can be unlearned. In 1981, it was adapted into the controversial film of the same name, in which director Samuel Fuller made various changes to the novel's story to <b>focus</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dog and present a more pessimistic ending than the original novel. The film's American release after negative press from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) led to concerns of boycotts.|$|E
5|$|ABC aired another series {{featuring}} the Hardy Boys, The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, from 1977 to 1979. The prime time series starred Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy as Frank and Joe Hardy; Pamela Sue Martin and later Janet Louise Johnson played Nancy Drew. During the first season, the series alternated between episodes {{featuring the}} Hardy Boys one week and Nancy Drew the next. The Hardy Boys were cast as young adults (Stevenson and Cassidy were twenty-four and eighteen respectively {{during the filming}} of the first episodes) {{to appeal to a}} prime time television audience. The series featured original plots as well as ones based on Hardy Boys books, among them The Clue of the Screeching Owl, The Disappearing Floor and The Flickering Torch Mystery. The series received an Emmy nomination and featured a number of guest stars, including Kim Cattrall, Ray Milland, Howard Duff, and Ricky Nelson. During the second season, the series format changed to <b>focus</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew appearing mostly in crossover episodes with the brothers; midway through production of the second season, Martin quit and was replaced by Johnson. The series returned for a third season, dropping the Nancy Drew character completely and shortening its title to The Hardy Boys.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{facility}} did attract visitors, local residents' support {{failed to reach}} the numbers expected by the founders. Original projections of 300,000 admissions per year were never met. In October 2006, the museum announced plans to turn galleries into conference rooms, remove most of the museum's focus on art, and lay off 28 of its 85 employees (most of whom were security guards for the art gallery). At the time, Copia had $68 million ($ today) in debt. That year the museum also lowered its original adult admission fee of $12.50 to $5. For three months in 2006, the museum admitted guests free of charge, and attendance and revenue increased. The museum also began hosting weddings and renting its space more frequently {{in order to raise}} revenue. In 2007, the museum altered its theme significantly by removing its focus on food and art, and instead focusing solely on wine. It replaced some of its gardens with vineyards, changed its displays to <b>focus</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> history and aspects of wine and viticulture, and decreased the restaurant's and programs' focus on food.|$|E

5|$|An {{alliance}} between the Iazyges and the Dacians led the Romans to <b>focus</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Danube than the Rhine. This is reflected by {{the placement of the}} Roman legions; During the time of Augustus's rule, there were eight legions stationed along the Rhine, four stationed in Mainz and another four in Cologne. Within a hundred years of Augustus' rule, however, Roman military resources had become centred along the Danube instead of the Rhine, with nine legions stationed along the Danube and only one at the Rhine. However, by the time of Marcus Aurelius, twelve legions were stationed along the Danube. The Romans also built a series of forts along the entire right bank of the Danubefrom Germany {{all the way to the}} Black Seaand in the provinces of Rhaetia, Noricum, and Pannonia the legions constructed bridge-head forts. Later, this system was expanded to the lower Danube, with the key castra of Poetovio, Brigetio, and Carnuntum. The Classis Pannonica and Classis Flavia Moesica were deployed to the right and lower Danube, respectively; however, they had to overcome the mass of whirlpools and cataracts of the Iron Gates.|$|E
5|$|For Halloween II, Zombie {{decided to}} <b>focus</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{connection}} between Laurie and Michael, {{and the idea}} they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. For the characters of Halloween II, it is about change. Zombie {{wanted to look at}} how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to show the connection between Laurie and Michael, and provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1990s archaeological {{research}} at Gedi and other Swahili coastal settlements has intensified. From the 1980s archaeological research increasingly began to <b>focus</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{relationships between the}} coastal communities and their internal development, challenging the original notion {{that the development of}} the Swahili Coast was driven by foreign influence through Indian Ocean trade or by Arab colonists. Another important development in the study of Swahili coastal sites is the increased attention given to remains of structures that were not built of stone. Surveys of the open terrain at Gedi found dense concentrations of mud-thatched dwellings. In 2001, Stephane Pradines from the Institute Francias d'Archeologie Orientale and archaeologists from the National Museum of Kenya conducted a topographical survey of Gedi, which mapped the distribution of neighborhoods in order to investigate the site's urban development. Concurrently, Lynn Koplin conducted surveys of the mud-thatch neighborhoods, focusing on the area between the inner and outer walls. From 2002 to 2003, {{research at}} Gedi continued to focus on urban development prior to the fifteenth century, with focus on a group of coral houses built by social elites in the site's urban core.|$|E

5|$|Starbreeze then {{partnered with}} Electronic Arts for two {{different}} games, one {{was known as}} Project Redlime, while the other was an action-adventure video game set within the Bourne universe. The Bourne game was cancelled {{as a direct result}} of Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass not participating in the fourth Bourne film. Project Redlime had a larger scale than the Bourne game. It was said to be a reinvention of one of Electronic Arts' franchises. The company shifted from a technology-orientated company to <b>focus</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> core gameplay mechanics of their new project. Syndicate was announced in September 2011. The game suffered from a troubled development, with Starbreeze completely reworking the game one year after its initial development. There were also many creative differences between the developer and the publisher, and the two companies suffered from an inharmonious relationship. During the game's development, seven senior members of the company, including Högdahl, left to form their own smaller studio. Some of them formed MachineGames to work on their own original games. With a budget that was less than other typical AAA video games, Syndicate received average reviews and was a commercial failure. Grefberg left the company after the game's completion, and 25 employees were laid off.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary source}} of {{information}} about the reign of Andrianampoinimerina is Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, a Malagasy language book relating the oral history of the Merina kings as collected by a Jesuit missionary, Francois Callet, in the late 19th century. Prior to the eventual release of a French language translation in the 1950s, references to the king in academic and popular writing during the colonial period de-emphasized his role as a conduit of traditional religious power and authority, instead glorifying his administrative practices in an attempt to bring greater credibility to the colonial government as a vehicle for building upon and strengthening the principles of good governance that he introduced. Beginning in the 1970s, historians began to <b>focus</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spiritual aspects of his role as king, and researchers questioned and compared sources in an effort to arrive at a more factual and balanced history of Andrianampoinimerina and his reign.|$|E
