5|$|Male {{students}} and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent the shootings, but Nathalie Provost, one of the survivors, said that she felt that nothing could have been <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the tragedy, and that her fellow students should not feel guilty.|$|E
5|$|Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot choreographed the {{original}} version of Giselle. Perrot and Carlotta Grisi were lovers and, consequently, Perrot designed all of her dances and pantomime. Everyone in the Paris dance world knew that Perrot had created Grisi's dances and Coralli admitted it, but Perrot was given no official credit in the printed materials such as posters and programs. This was most likely <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> Perrot from collecting royalties on the ballet. Perrot liked bold touches and planned several rapid aerial swoops on wires in Act II for Giselle. Grisi was afraid of these swoops, therefore a stage hand {{was brought in to}} test them. He crashed face-first into the scenery and the swoops were dropped.|$|E
5|$|The USB {{standard}} specifies relatively loose tolerances for compliant USB connectors {{to minimize}} physical incompatibilities in connectors from different vendors. To address a weakness present {{in some other}} connector standards, the USB specification also defines limits {{to the size of}} a connecting device in the area around its plug. This was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> a device from blocking adjacent ports due to the size of the cable strain relief mechanism (usually molding integral with the cable outer insulation) at the connector. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable that does.|$|E

5|$|In {{designing}} the levels, Newcomer added platforms {{to the environment}} after the combat was devised. A static game world was chosen over a scrolling world to showcase visual textures applied to the platforms. The hardware could not easily display the textures while scrolling, and the team felt that displaying the whole environment would aid players. The last game world element was a lava pit and a hand reaching out of it to destroy characters {{too close to the}} bottom. Newcomer placed the platforms to optimize Pfutzenrueter's enemy artificial intelligence (AI), which factors attack patterns based partly on platform placements. The knight enemies were designed to exhibit progressively more aggressive behavior. Bounders fly around the environment randomly, occasionally reacting to the protagonist. Hunters seek the player's character in an effort to collide. Shadow Lords fly quickly and closer {{to the top of the}} screen. Pfutzenrueter designed them to fly higher when close to the protagonist to increase the Shadow Lord's chances of victory against the player. The pterodactyl was designed to attack idle players and be difficult to defeat. The only vulnerability was attacking the creature in its open mouth during a specific animation frame. Newcomer and Pfutzenrueter designed the pterodactyl to quickly fly upward at the last moment when approaching a player waiting at the edge of a platform. This was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> an easy defeat of the enemy. When processing the graphics, the game gives priority to the player characters over the enemies. As a result, enemies begin to react more slowly when the number of on-screen sprites increases.|$|E
25|$|On 15 July, Alain Juppé, {{former prime}} {{minister}} of France {{and one of the}} final two candidates to become the Republican candidate for the April–May 2017 presidential election; and Christian Estrosi, former Nice mayor, raised the question of whether more could have been <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the attack.|$|E

25|$|Conductive coating – an ultrathin {{coating of}} {{electrically}} conducting material, deposited either by high vacuum evaporation or by low vacuum sputter coating of the sample.

25|$|For {{more than}} 50 years, there were oil spills {{every year in}} the Niger Delta, with nothing <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> new spills. The {{contamination}} was never cleaned, thereby leaving the water undrinkable, the lands infertile and causing the death of wildlife and aquatic lives. The conditions were compared to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|When John Paul II died, the Camerlengo Eduardo Martínez Somalo {{removed the}} Pope's Ring of the Fisherman from his finger, then {{ceremonial}}ly crushed {{it with the}} ceremonial silver hammer {{in the presence of}} members of the College of Cardinals.

25|$|A {{public viewing}} {{was held on}} June 29, 1844, after which empty coffins {{weighted}} with sandbags were used at the public burial. (This was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> theft or mutilation of the bodies.) The coffins bearing {{the bodies of the}} Smith brothers were initially buried under the unfinished Nauvoo House, then disinterred and deeply reburied under an out-building on the Smith homestead.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{survivors}} arrived in New York, investigations were being planned {{to discover what}} had happened, {{and what could be}} <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> a recurrence.

The United Kingdom recommends against its use for infectious endocarditis prophylaxis. These recommendations do not appear to have changed the rates of infection for infectious endocarditis.|$|E

25|$|A {{compressor}} in stereo linking mode {{applies the}} same amount of gain reduction to both the left and right channels. This is <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> image shifting that can occur if each channel is compressed individually. It becomes noticeable when a loud element that is panned to either edge of the stereo field raises the level of the program to the compressor's threshold, causing its image to shift {{toward the center of the}} stereo field.|$|E
25|$|The locks {{are usually}} manned during the {{cruising}} season from Easter to October and padlocked outside operating hours. This is <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> water shortages due to misuse {{and to ensure}} a balance between those wishing to ascend and descend. There can be lengthy delays at busy times but the actual transit should take approximately 45 minutes to one hour to complete; it is made quicker {{by the fact that}} the locks are narrow beam and the gates are light.|$|E
25|$|Upon a papal death, {{the ring}} {{used to be}} ceremonially {{destroyed}} using a hammer {{in the presence of}} other Cardinals by the Camerlengo. This was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> issuance of forged documents during the interregnum, or sede vacante. Today, the destruction of the ring's device with deep scratches is a symbol of the end of rule of the pope who used to wear that ring. This custom was followed after the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI by applying two deep cuts, {{in the shape of a}} cross, on the signet with a chisel.|$|E

25|$|Eli goes on {{to train}} Samuel. When Samuel hears God {{speaking}} to him, he at first thinks it is Eli; Eli, who doesn't hear God calling Samuel, eventually realizes the truth, and instructs Samuel on how to respond. Samuel is told that God's threat (which isn't elaborated further) {{will be carried out}} on Eli and his family, and that there is nothing that can be <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> it. Eli asks Samuel what he had been told, insisting that he be told the whole truth, and so Samuel does; Eli reacts by saying that God will do as he judges best.|$|E
25|$|A {{national}} {{poll by the}} Angus Reid organization {{released on}} November 25, 2014 revealed that Canadians in general were also split as well on whether the attack and shooting {{was an act of}} terrorism or mental illness. 38% felt that it was the result of mental illness, while 36% felt it was terrorism, with 25% undecided. Asked about what the federal government should do as a result, 54% felt that more initiatives should be <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> radicalization, while 34% favoured harsher punishments. On how to deal with homegrown terrorists, 54% felt that indefinite incarceration only motivated persons to commit crimes, while 46% felt it prevented violent crime.|$|E
25|$|After the 1919–20 season, the NHL {{took back}} the Quebec {{franchise}} {{and sold the}} team to the Abso Pure Ice Company of Hamilton, Ontario. The club was moved to Hamilton for the 1920–21 season and renamed the Hamilton Tigers. This was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the startup of a rival league that was trying to land a club in Hamilton. (see Eddie Livingstone) At the time, the NHL had no teams in the United States and no teams in Western Canada. Hamilton was the fifth-largest {{city in the country}} and third-largest in Central Canada (pop. 114,200) and therefore was considered a vital market. Percy Thompson, a part-owner and manager of the Barton Street Arena, became manager of the team.|$|E
