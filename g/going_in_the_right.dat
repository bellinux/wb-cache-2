500|$|Chicago's bid was {{supported}} by major preliminary corporate commitments, philanthropic efforts by wealthy Chicagoans, promised planning participation by {{a wide range of}} community and government leaders, and the enthusiasm of the citizenry. Local support for the bid on the South Side, particularly in the Washington Park and Woodlawn community areas, was divided. Ben Joravsky, a Chicago Reader columnist, was one of the strongest critics of the Chicago 2016 bid. However, 2007 opinion polls indicated 76 percent public support. [...] In 2009, as the final selection approached, opponents of the bid became vocal even though organizers seemed to be pleased with the bid's progress and presentation. Peter Ueberroth stated, [...] "Chicago is <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction, and we are impressed by that." ...|$|E
500|$|Leonard Boyarsky, art {{director}} of the original Fallout, when asked about Interplay Entertainment's sale of the rights to Bethesda Softworks, said [...] "To be perfectly honest, I was extremely disappointed {{that we did not}} get the chance to make the next Fallout game. This {{has nothing to do with}} Bethesda, it's just that we've always felt that Fallout was ours and it was just a technicality that Interplay happened to own it. It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just sit by and watch. Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction with it or not.".|$|E
500|$|He {{eventually}} {{turned down}} talks with York {{and agreed to}} sign a one-year contract with fellow Conference team Mansfield Town on 19 May. On signing, Smith said [...] "It {{was time for a}} change after not getting as much football as I would have liked. I'm still young, Mansfield are <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction and I'm excited about the new season". He made his debut in the opening match of 2010–11, a 3–1 victory over Forest Green, and was substituted in the 80th minute. Smith scored his first goal for Mansfield in a 4–0 victory over Altrincham on 30 August. A red card in the 61st minute of a 1–0 defeat at Gateshead on 2 October for a high challenge resulted in a three match suspension. He finished the season with 38 appearances and six goals.|$|E

2500|$|A poll in late May 1988 {{found that}} a {{majority}} of voters were not concerned with whether or not a candidate had a controversial member within their family - a reference to Rosenberg's brother Erhard. The poll, conducted by Chapman University's Chapman College Survey group for The Orange County Register, showed Cox leading in the Republican primary with 15 percent to Rosenberg's 13 percent. 57 percent of voters polled were undecided. Of those that were decided, 36 percent supported Cox, while 30 percent supported Rosenberg. [...] "I think the undecideds will break out {{along the lines of the}} people who have already decided," [...] he said. [...] "We'll get the lion's share.

60|$|After partaking {{of bitter}} maté, I thanked my hostess, looked my last into Monica's dark, sorrowful eyes, lifted {{for one moment}} to mine, and kissed little Anita's pathetic face, by so doing filling the child with astonishment and causing {{considerable}} amusement to {{the other members of}} the family. After we had ridden about four miles, keeping nearly parallel with the river, it struck me that we were not <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction--the right one for me, at any rate.

60|$|One {{morning they}} sighted a brig sailing southward, {{but as she}} was of no great size and not <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> {{direction}} to make it probable that she carried a cargo worth their while, they turned westward and ran towards Cuba. Had Captain Bonnet known that his daughter was on the brig which he thus disdained, his mind {{would have been far}} different; but as it was, not knowing anything more than he could see, and not understanding much of that, he kept his westerly course, and on the next day the lookout sighted a good-sized merchantman bearing eastward.|$|E
60|$|Through it all {{the father}} never {{suspected}} the real state of his son's mind. He was too simple to think {{it possible that the}} purpose which Silverbridge had declared to him as they walked together from the Beargarden had already been thrown to the winds.

But, when he saw them together, he concluded that matters were <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction. It was, however, an opinion which he had all to himself.|$|E

Perhaps you will ask me how I could tell which was which on such a night. I answer that it was by the wind.

In this hope he kept steadily advancing, until he found himself in the midst of those rocky fastnesses which divide the waters that flow into the Atlantic from those that flow into the Pacific Ocean. Still the slight crust of snow lay on the ground, and he had no means of knowing whether he was <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction or not.|$|E

60|$|I was not {{positively}} {{sure that}} we were <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction, for my position did not allow me to see very far over the water; but I remembered that when I was standing up in the boat, and made my discovery, the sun {{was just about to}} rise in front of me, while the dark spot on the ocean lay to my left. Judging, therefore, from the present position of the sun, which was not very high, I concluded that we were moving toward the north, and therefore in the right direction. How far off the steamer might be I had no idea, for I was not accustomed to judging distances at sea; but I believed that if we were careful of our strength, and if the ocean continued as smooth as it now was, we might eventually reach the vessel, provided she were yet afloat.|$|E

2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's <b>going</b> on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world <b>right</b> now". Likewise, {{he notes that the}} album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write about stuff that is specific to my life during the time I write an album. And I try to find things that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. And so {{this is one of the}} main things that have been occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves they have a lot of relevance to what's <b>going</b> on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world <b>right</b> now [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. And also I think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented sometimes that I feel like those things are a better representation of what I'm writing about than printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|R
