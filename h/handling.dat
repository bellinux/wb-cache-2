Plastic and fiberglass <b>handles</b> are lightweight, while wood <b>handles</b> are heavy. Metal <b>handles</b> conduct heat away from the hands more readily than other kinds of <b>handles,</b> so they feel colder.|$|R
40|$|Instrumented <b>handles</b> or dynamometers {{are widely}} used to measure hand forces and/or the biodynamic {{response}} of hand-arm system. To study hand-transmitted vibration exposure, six generations of instrument <b>handles</b> were constructed or initially developed by researchers in ECTB/HELD/NIOSH. This presentation provided a summary of these <b>handles.</b> Their basic characteristics, limitations, and usefulness are described, which may help their appropriate applications and further improvements. Six Designs of Instrumented <b>Handles</b> <b>Handle</b> 1 : The conceptual design is recommended in ISO 10819 (1996) 1 for glove test. The grip force is measured by detecting bending strains on a measuring beam in the <b>handle.</b> A special <b>handle</b> fixture was designed to connect the <b>handle</b> to a shaker. Except the screws, the <b>handle</b> and fixture were made from aluminum. <b>Handle</b> 2 : The design {{is based on the}} principle of shear strain measurement. 2 - 3 Both grip and push forces can be measured simultaneously using this <b>handle.</b> This <b>handle</b> was directly designed for a simulated vibrating tool. <b>Handle</b> 3 : This design is basically composed of a <b>handle</b> base, a measuring cap, and two charge-based sensors (Kistler 9212) sandwiched between the base and cap. The <b>handle</b> was also made from aluminum. The fixture for <b>Handle</b> 1 was also used with this <b>handle.</b> This generation of <b>handle</b> has three different <b>handle</b> diameters (30, 40, and 50 mm). 4 <b>Handle</b> 4 : This design is an improvement from <b>Handle</b> 3. The <b>handle</b> fixture was totally redesigned and it was much stiffer than the previous one. The aluminum measuring cap was replaced with a magnesium cap. <b>Handle</b> 5 : The basic structure of this <b>handle</b> is the same as that for <b>Handle</b> 3. However, the piezoelectric sensors were replaced with two strain gage based sensors (Interface SML- 50). <b>Handle</b> 6 : This <b>handle</b> includes two measuring caps, four piezoelectric sensors, and a <b>handle</b> centre base. The <b>handle</b> fixture was the same as that with <b>Handle</b> 4. Methods for <b>Handle</b> Examinations The static and dynamic characterizations were performed using the methods reported by Dong et al. 5 - 6 Results and Discussion <b>Handle</b> 1 : The static force measurement depended on the hand grip location on the <b>handle.</b> Its natural frequency was less than 200 Hz. 5, 6 Because the transmissibility of gloves may not vary significantly with the applied grip force, this <b>handle</b> may be acceptable for glove test. However, the force measurements with this <b>handle</b> may not be reliable. <b>Handle</b> 2 : The static force measured with this <b>handle</b> was insensitive to the hand acting location. However, when the <b>handle</b> was vibrating, the force signals could be totally distorted. For this reason, it was not used for vibration studies...|$|R
50|$|Whenever {{an object}} is created or opened, a {{reference}} to the instance, called a <b>handle,</b> is created. Object Manager indexes the objects both by their names as well as the <b>handles.</b> But, referencing the objects by the <b>handles</b> is faster because the name translation can be skipped. <b>Handles</b> are associated with processes (by making an entry into the process' <b>Handle</b> table that lists the <b>handles</b> it owns), and can be transferred between processes as well. A process must own a <b>handle</b> to an object before using it. A process can own a maximum of 16,000,000 <b>handles</b> at one time. During creation, a process gains <b>handles</b> to a default set of objects. While there exists different types of <b>handles</b> - file <b>handles,</b> event <b>handles</b> and process <b>handles</b> - they only help in identifying the type of the target objects; not in distinguishing the operations that can be performed through them, thus providing consistency to how various object types are <b>handled</b> programmatically. <b>Handle</b> creation and resolution of objects from <b>handles</b> are solely mediated by Object Manager, so no resource usage goes unnoticed by it.|$|R

50|$|Implementation of the <b>Handle</b> System {{consists}} of Local <b>Handle</b> Services, {{each of which}} is made up of one or more sites that provide the servers that store specific <b>handles.</b> The Global <b>Handle</b> Registry is a unique Local <b>Handle</b> Service which stores information on the prefixes (also known as naming authorities) within the <b>Handle</b> System and can be queried to find out where specific <b>handles</b> are stored on other Local <b>Handle</b> Services within this distributed system.|$|R
50|$|The {{interoperable}} {{network of}} distributed <b>handle</b> resolver servers (also {{known as the}} Proxy Server System) are linked through a Global Resolver (which is one logical entity though physically decentralised and mirrored).

The Global <b>Handle</b> Registry maintains and resolves the prefixes of locally maintained <b>handle</b> services. Any local <b>handle</b> service can, therefore, resolve any <b>handle</b> through the Global Resolver.|$|R

5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the crossbar, teams could play without a goalkeeper. The first reference to a goalkeeper appears in the report of the Battle of Bramall Lane in 1862. The position, however, was used as an alternative to sending off a player. Although a recognised position goalkeeper sometimes was also referred to in the rules as the player nearest their own goal (allowing him the luxury of <b>handling</b> the ball). Unlike its FA counterpart Sheffield Rules never restricted <b>handling</b> to one designated player. Despite this by the 1870s teams usually featured a single player in the position.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{shape of}} laparoscopic {{instrument}} <b>handles</b> can cause physical discomfort. This {{problem may be}} ascribed {{to a lack of}} standards for instrument design. In this study, new ergonomic requirements for the design of laparoscopic dissection forceps were created. Three representative <b>handles</b> (a Karl Storz [click-line] scissors <b>handle,</b> an Access Plus scissors <b>handle,</b> and an Aesculap cylindrical <b>handle)</b> currently available on the market were evaluated according to the new list of ergonomic criteria. Materials and Methods: The <b>handles</b> were subjectively (questionnaire) and objectively (video analyses) tested in order to find out whether the new requirements are valid for the evaluation and design of instrument <b>handles.</b> Results: The outcome of the subjective and objective tests matched the predictions by the new criteria list. New criteria were introduced (neutral wrist excursions), and existing general criteria were specified (e. g., a minimal contact area of 10 mm). Significant differences were found among the three <b>handles.</b> The Storz <b>handle</b> met 8 of the 10 requirements, the Access <b>handle</b> met 5, and the Aesculap <b>handle</b> met only 4. Conclusions: The new list of ergonomic requirements is a valid tool to determine the ergonomic value of a <b>handle</b> for laparoscopic dissecting tasks. It gains its strength from its specialized character. Significant differences were found among the three tested <b>handles.</b> Cylindrical <b>handles</b> were inferior to scissors <b>handles.</b> Industrial Design Engineerin...|$|R

5|$|Dirks' work in {{computational}} chemistry involved creating algorithms and computational {{tools for}} the analysis of nucleic acid thermodynamics and nucleic acid structure prediction. Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of nucleic acid design and analysis tools, which generates base pairing probabilities through calculation of the statistical partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable of <b>handling</b> an arbitrary number of interacting strands rather than being limited to one or two. Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently <b>handling</b> certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements this ability for single RNA strands.|$|E
