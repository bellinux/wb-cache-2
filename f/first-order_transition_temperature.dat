40|$|SUMMARY The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to investigate the rheological properties of four com-mercially available gutta perchas for root canal filling. The relaxation modulus [Gr(0) : instantaneous shear modulus] and specific volume of their mate-rials were examined. In addition, the quantity of heat was also studied by differential scanning cal-orimeter. In a lower temperature range than the <b>first-order</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> (melting point), the Gr(0) values of each material were almost identical. A marked decrease of Gr(0) was observed at the melting point, and the range of the <b>first-order</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> at heating was from 42 Æ 0 to 60 Æ 0 C. At higher temperatures than the <b>first-order</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> of each material, a consider-able difference in Gr(0) values was observed. The transition temperatures obtained by the results of the Gr(0), specific volume and quantity of heat agreed with one another. A marked specific volume change was observed at the <b>first-order</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature.</b> The technique using melted gutta percha may not be favourable compared with the conventional lateral condensation technique because melted gutta percha undergoes a large amount of shrinkage during setting...|$|E

For a moderate J 2 /J 1 -value, the model exhibits a first-order transition into an incommensurate multiple-q ordered state where multiple Bragg peaks coexist in the spin structure factor. We show that {{there are two types of}} metastable multiple-q states, a cubic symmetric sextuple-q state and a non-cubic symmetric quadruple-q state. Based on a Monte Carlo simulation, we find that the cubic sextuple-q state appears just below the <b>first-order</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature,</b> while another transition from the cubic sextuple-q state to the non-cubic quadruple-q state occurs at a lower temperature.

40|$|Alkanes {{of medium}} chain length show an unusual wetting {{behavior}} on (salt) water, exhibiting {{a sequence of}} two changes in the wetting state. When deposited on the water surface at low temperatures, the liquid alkane forms discrete droplets that are interconnected only by a molecularly thin film. On increase of the temperature, there occurs a sudden jump of the film thickness and, at this <b>first-order</b> <b>transition,</b> a mesoscopically thick layer of liquid alkane is formed. Heating the system further leads to a divergence of the film thickness in a continuous manner. While the long-range forces between substrate and adsorbate {{are responsible for the}} critical transition, which occurs at the temperature at which the Hamaker constant changes sign, it is primarily the short-range components of the forces that bring about the <b>first-order</b> <b>transition.</b> We calculate the Hamaker constant of the system and show how, within a modified Cahn theory, accurate predictions of the <b>first-order</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperatures</b> can be obtained for n-alkanes (pentane and hexane) on water and even on brine.

40|$|Glass-to-glass and liquid-to-liquid phase {{transitions}} {{are observed}} in bulk and confined water, {{with or without}} applied pressure. They result from the competition of two liquid phases separated by an enthalpy difference depending on temperature. The classical nucleation equation of these phases is completed by this quantity existing at all temperatures, a pressure contribution, and an enthalpy excess. This equation leads to two homogeneous nucleation temperatures in each liquid phase, the first one being the formation temperature of an ordered liquid phase below the melting temperature and the second one corresponding to the overheating temperature. Thermodynamic properties, double glass transition temperatures, sharp enthalpy and volume changes are predicted in agreement with experimental results. The first-order transition line between fragile and strong liquids joins two critical points.

40|$|STATICS A {{one-dimensional}} Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian containig nonlinear {{contributions of}} a two component order parameter is considered. It may be viewd {{as a model}} describing first-order phase transitions from a high temperature parent phase into any of three variants. The structure and energy of the static (as well as traveling) solitary boundaries connecting two different variant phases or parent-variant phases are calculated at all temperatures. Approaching the first- order transition temperature from below, the solitary boundary connecting two variants splits gradually into two parent-variant solitary domain walls of finite width. Their separation, however, diverges at the transition temperature. This temperature is the border point between two topologically different classes of domain walls, which apparently also have different nontrivial time ependence. Below the transition point the solutions are of traveling type, but above the transition temperature they have oscillatory time dependence. Linearized perturbation analysis around the stationary soliton boundaries shows them to be marginally stable below the transition temperature and unstable at the transition temperature. The structure of the lowest energy perturbation modes is also examined. DYNAMICS We present numerical results concerning solitary-antisolitary (SS) collisions for temperatures below the first-order transition point, and the sole existence of oscillatory SS arrays above the first order transition temperature. The rich spectrum of behaviors is governed by coupled nonintegrable and nonlinear wave equations which result from a model Lagrangian for a complex scalar (two-component) field ih one-space dimension, and {{in the presence of}} three fold phase anisotropy in the local potential energy density. This model reduces to the Φ 4 model for a unique temperature. For all temperatures below the first-order transition point and for low, intermediate; and high initial velocities, the SS collisions result in trapped states, alternating sequence of trapping and reflection, and reflection states, respectively. Only for the Φ 4 - temperature and the <b>first-order</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> the spatial characteristics of the trajectories on the order parameter plane persist both statically and dynamically. SS collisions above the Φ 4 - temperature induce chazges in the observable physical properties of the system, whereas below this temperature the SS collisions leave the system's properties unchanged.

Integrating out the part of order parameter (equation of state), we obtained an effective Landau expansion for the free energy written in terms of the order parameter Ψ(m). Using the Maxwell construction we have obtained the phase diagram in the T−H plane for all intervals of the field. The <b>first-order</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> is calculated by the discontinuity of the magnetization at Tc∗(H), on the other hand in the continuous transition the magnetization is null at T=Tc(H).

40|$|A {{description}} of heterogeneous nucleation {{at a single}} defect, followed by {{the evolution of the}} nucleus as it grows in the parent phase background, is given. The theory is based on a nonlinear and nonlocal elastic free energy expansion, and the main assumption in our treatment is that of the interface separating parent and martensitic phases being completely coherent. The nucleating event is simply the response of the parent phase to the stress field of a defect that couples to the order parameter strain describing the transition. At the <b>first-order</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature,</b> around a weak defect, a small strain is produced. Then, after supercooling the system through the bulk transition temper-ature, a martensitic nucleus may appear, and we follow its growth as described by the deterministic dynamics of the elastic field. We show that the growth is going to lead to a twinned product phase due to dynamical energy reasons, viz. minimizing the kinetic energy, in contrast to the static energetics arguments of nonlinear elastic theories. Thus, this evolution of a martensitic embryo provides a simple and natural explanation of file phenomenon of autocatalytic twin formation...|$|E
40|$|We {{focus on}} the Gibbs free energy Δ G for {{nucleating}} a droplet of the stable phase (e. g. solid) inside the metastable parent phase (e. g. liquid), close to the <b>first-order</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature.</b> This quantity {{is central to the}} theory of homogeneous nucleation, since it superintends the nucleation rate. We recently introduced a field theory describing the dependence of Δ G on the droplet volume V, taking into account besides the microscopic fuzziness of the droplet-parent interface, also small fluctuations around the spherical shape whose effect, assuming isotropy, was found to be a characteristic logarithmic term. Here we extend this theory, introducing the effect of anisotropy in the surface tension, and show that in the limit of strong anisotropy Δ G(V) once more develops a term logarithmic on V, now with a prefactor of opposite sign with respect to the isotropic case. Based on this result, we argue that the geometrical shape that large solid nuclei mostly prefer could be inferred from the prefactor of the logarithmic term in the droplet free energy, as determined from the optimization of its near-coexistence profile.

40|$|The van der Waals (vdW) {{theory of}} fluids {{is the first}} and {{simplest}} theory {{that takes into account}} interactions between the particles of a system that result in a phase transition versus temperature. Combined with Maxwell's construction, this mean-field theory predicts the conditions for equilibrium coexistence between the gas and liquid phases and the first-order transition between them. However, important properties of the vdW fluid have not been systematically investigated. Here we report a comprehensive study of these properties. Ambiguities about the physical interpretation of the Boyle temperature and the influence of the vdW molecular interactions on the pressure of the vdW gas are resolved. Thermodynamic variables and properties are formulated in reduced units that allow all properties to be expressed as laws of corresponding states that apply to all vdW fluids. Lekner's parametric solution for the vdW gas-liquid coexistence curve in the pressure-temperature plane and related thermodynamic properties [Am. J. Phys. 50, 161 (1982) ] is explained and significantly extended. Hysteresis in the <b>first-order</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> on heating and cooling is examined and the maximum degrees of superheating and supercooling determined.

The temperature dependences of the isothermal compressibility, thermal expansion coefficient and heat capacity at constant pressure for a range of pressures above, at and below the critical pressure are systematically studied from numerical calculations including their critical behaviors and their discontinuities on crossing the coexistence curve. Joule-Thomson expansion of the vdW gas is investigated in detail and the pressure and temperature conditions for liquifying a vdW gas on passing through the throttle are determined.

40|$|In recent experiments, a {{sequence}} {{of changes in the}} wetting state ("wetting transitions'') has been observed upon increasing the temperature in systems consisting of pentane on pure water and of hexane on brine. In this sequential-wetting scenario, there occurs a <b>first-order</b> <b>transition</b> from a partial-wetting state, in which only a microscopically thin film of adsorbate is present on the substrate, to a "frustrated complete wetting state'' characterized by a mesoscopically, but not yet macroscopically thick wetting film. At higher temperatures, one observes a continuous divergence of the film thickness and finally, at the critical-wetting temperature, the complete-wetting state, featuring a macroscopic film thickness, is reached. This sequence of two transitions is brought about by an interplay of short-range and long-range interactions between substrate and adsorbate. The critical wetting transition is controlled by the long-range forces and is, thus, found by determining where the Hamaker constant, as calculated from a Dzyaloshinskii-Lifshitz-Pitaevskii-type theory, changes sign. The <b>first-order</b> <b>transition</b> involves both short-range and long-range forces and is, therefore, more difficult to locate. While the pentane-water system is well understood in this respect by now, a detailed theoretical description of the hexane-brine system is hampered by the a priori unknown modification of the interactions between substrate and adsorbate upon the addition of salt. In this work, we argue that the short-range interaction (contact energy) between hexane and pure water remains unchanged due to the formation of a depletion layer (a thin "layer'' of pure water which is completely devoid of ions) at the surface of the electrolyte and that the presence of the salt manifests itself only in a modification of the long-range interaction between substrate and adsorbate. In a five-layer calculation considering brine, water, the first layer of adsorbed hexane molecules, liquid hexane, and vapor, we determine the new long-range interaction of brine with the adsorbate across the water layer. According to the recent theory of the excess surface tension of an electrolyte by Levin and Flores-Mena, this water layer is of constant, i. e., salt-concentration independent, thickness delta, with delta being the hydrodynamic radius of the ions in water. Once this radius has been determined, the <b>first-order</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperatures</b> can be calculated from the dielectric properties of the five media.

40|$|Abstract. Hydrogen {{produced}} from the photocatalytic splitting {{of water is}} one of the reliable alternatives to replace the polluting fossil and the radioac-tive nuclear fuels. Here, we provide unequivocal evidence for the existence of blue- and red-shifting O−H covalent bonds within a single water molecule adsorbed on MgO surface as a result of asymmetric displacement polarizabil-ities. The adsorbed H−O−H on MgO gives rise to one weaker H−O bond, while the other O−H covalent bond from the same adsorbed water molecule compensates this effect with a stronger bond. The weaker bond (nearest to the surface), the interlayer tunneling electrons and the silver substrate are shown to be the causes for the smallest dissociative activation energy on MgO monolayer.

Here, we provide unequivocal evidence for the existence of blue- and red-shifting O$-$H covalent bonds within a single water molecule adsorbed on MgO surface as a result of asymmetric displacement polarizabilities. The adsorbed H-O-H on MgO gives rise to one weaker H-O bond, while the other O-H covalent bond from the same adsorbed water molecule compensates this effect with a stronger bond. The weaker bond (nearest to the surface), the interlayer tunneling electrons and the silver substrate are shown to be the causes for the smallest dissociative activation energy on MgO monolayer. The origin that is responsible to initiate the splitting mechanism is proven to be due to the changes in the polarizability of an adsorbed water molecule, which are further supported by the temperature-dependent static dielectric constant measurements for water below the <b>first-order</b> electronic-phase <b>transition</b> <b>temperature.</b> Comment: To be published in PhysChemChemPhy...|$|R
