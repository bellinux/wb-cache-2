5|$|On 20 May 2009, Andreas Mogensen, a {{researcher}} at the Surrey Space Centre, was announced as a new member of the European Astronaut Corps, part of the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> and in doing so, will become the first Danish astronaut.|$|E
5|$|Since 1999, {{the leading}} Hubble {{outreach}} group in Europe {{has been the}} Hubble <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> Information Centre (HEIC). This office was established at the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility in Munich, Germany. HEIC's mission is to fulfill HST outreach and education tasks for the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency.</b> The work is centered on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble results and images. These are often European in origin, and so increase awareness of both ESA's Hubble share (15%) and the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. ESA produces educational material, including a videocast series called Hubblecast designed to share world-class scientific news with the public.|$|E

5|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency,</b> in {{collaboration}} with Roscosmos, launched the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Schiaparelli lander on March 14, 2016. While the Trace Gas Orbiter successfully entered Mars orbit on October 19, 2016, Schiaparelli crashed during its landing attempt.|$|E
5|$|The main {{purposes}} of the mission were to test new safety and repair techniques introduced following the Columbia disaster {{as well as to}} deliver supplies, equipment, and <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA) astronaut Thomas Reiter from Germany to the ISS. The transfer of Reiter to the ISS returned the station to a three crew member staffing level.|$|E
5|$|As 241Am has {{a roughly}} similar {{half-life}} to 238Pu (432.2 years vs. 87 years), {{it has been}} proposed as an active element of radioisotope thermoelectric generators, for example in spacecraft. Although americium produces less heat and electricity – the power yield is 114.7mW/g for 241Am and 6.31mW/g for 243Am (cf. 390mW/g for 238Pu) – and its radiation poses more threat to humans owing to neutron emission, the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> is considering using americium for its space probes.|$|E

5|$|At 4p.m. PDT on May 22, the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> and Italian Space Agency {{arranged}} for a call to Endeavour by Pope Benedict XVI. During his call—prompted by {{the discovery of a}} gash in the Shuttle's fuselage—the Pope extended his blessing to Kelly's wife, Gabrielle Giffords, who had undergone skull surgery earlier in the week. The event marked the first time a Pope spoke to astronauts {{during the course of a}} mission.|$|E
5|$|On 20 {{missions}} (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, {{designed in}} cooperation with the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA). Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock. Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.|$|E

Then, Venus Express by the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA) entered orbit around Venus in April 2006. Equipped with seven scientific instruments, Venus Express provided unprecedented long-term observation of Venus's atmosphere. ESA concluded that mission in December 2014.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland Space Agency, the Swiss Space Office, {{has been}} {{involved}} in various space technologies and programmes. In addition {{it was one of the}} 10 founders of the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> in 1975 and is the seventh largest contributor to the ESA budget. In the private sector, several companies are implicated in the space industry such as Oerlikon Space or Maxon Motors who provide spacecraft structures.|$|E
5|$|The Cassini–Huygens {{spacecraft}} reached Saturn on July 1, 2004, {{and began}} the process of mapping Titan's surface by radar. A joint project of the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA) and NASA, Cassini–Huygens proved a very successful mission. The Cassini probe flew by Titan on October 26, 2004, and took the highest-resolution images ever of Titan's surface, at only , discerning patches {{of light and dark}} that would be invisible to the human eye.|$|E

5|$|TrollSat sees only a {{fraction}} of the business of SvalSat. Troll is used for downloading from the Canadian Space Agency's Radarsat-1 and Radarsat-2, and the private GeoEye-1, WorldView-1 and WorldView-2. It will also be one of thirty ground stations for the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA)'s satellite navigation system Galileo, and is Norway's main contribution to the project. It further serves ESA's Envisat and several National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellites.|$|E
5|$|India, Japan, China, the United States, and the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> each sent lunar orbiters, and {{especially}} ISRO's Chandrayaan-1 {{has contributed to}} confirming the discovery of lunar water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and bound into the lunar regolith. The post-Apollo era has also seen two rover missions: the final Soviet Lunokhod mission in 1973, and China's ongoing Chang'e 3 mission, which deployed its Yutu rover on 14 December 2013. The Moon remains, under the Outer Space Treaty, free to all nations to explore for peaceful purposes.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of space travel gave scientists {{the opportunity to}} study the comet at close quarters, and several probes were launched to do so. The Soviet Vega 1 started returning images of Halley on 4 March 1986, and the first ever of its nucleus, and made its flyby on 6 March, followed by Vega 2 making its flyby on 9 March. On 14 March, the Giotto space probe, launched by the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency,</b> made the closest pass of the comet's nucleus. There were also two Japanese probes, Suisei and Sakigake. The probes were unofficially known as the Halley Armada.|$|E
5|$|The discoveries Cassini {{has made}} at Enceladus have {{prompted}} studies into follow-up mission concepts, including a flyby plume sample-return mission by NASA, a probe flyby (Journey to Enceladus and Titan or JET) to analyze plume contents in-situ, a lander by the German Aerospace Center {{to study the}} habitability potential of its subsurface ocean (Enceladus Explorer), and two astrobiology-oriented mission concepts (the Enceladus Life Finder and Life Investigation For Enceladus). The <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA) is also assessing concepts to send a probe to Enceladus in a mission to be combined with studies of Titan: TandEM (Titan and Enceladus Mission).|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{contract with}} ESRO lasted until 1 July 1974, when their low-Earth orbit program terminated. NTNF proposed closing Tromsø Telemetry Station as the remaining customers {{did not provide}} sufficient revenue to keep operations viable. Norway also declined to join the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA), which resulted in little hope in ESA choosing to cooperate with a Norwegian earth station. NTNF also looked into outright selling the station to ESA, but the offer was turned down. Kongsfjord Telemetry Station was closed in 1974.|$|E
