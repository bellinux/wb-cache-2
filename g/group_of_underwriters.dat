Thereafter there was no great problem in raising the finance but the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>underwriters</b> had certain reservations about the existing management structure in Goffs. As a compromise he agreed to take the job. Thus Irwin replaced Robert Myerscough as managing director of R.J. Goff and Co. Ltd. on 1 January 1975 and oversaw the construction of the world's first purpose built bloodstock sales complex in Kill. The cost of the proposed complex to be built on a 74.6 acre site at Kill - was estimated at £1.8 million as far back as August, 1974. [...] According to Irwin he didn't want merely the most modern and best equipped sales complex, he also wanted a whole new approach to business within the horse industry. He was mortified [...] "that class distinction should still be so rampant. It is difficult for an outsider to learn even how to buy a horse at a sale. Younger people just have to be attracted and to them and to everybody else my door will always be open." ...|$|E
40|$|We examine underpricing, long-run returns, lockup periods, {{and gross}} spreads for penny stock IPOs over the 1990 - 1998 period. We find that penny stock IPOs have higher initial returns than {{ordinary}} IPOs, but significantly worse long-run underperformance. We also find that penny stock IPOs have longer lockup periods and larger gross spreads. To explore {{the effect of}} potential market manipulation, we examine IPOs led by a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>underwriters</b> that were the subject of SEC enforcement actions and/or other penalties. Penny stock issues led by these banks are particularly underpriced and underperform ordinary IPOs led by other underwriters. Copyright (c) 2006 Financial Management Association International. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationships}} between underwriter reputation, underwriter spread, and IPO underpricing. We consider the information content <b>of</b> <b>underwriter</b> spread and find that it conveys information pertinent to IPO quality. Because underwriter spread is endogenous, underpricing and underwriter spread are jointly determined in a simultaneous equation system. Also, we examine the IPO market for evidence of segmentation, and our results suggest some market segmentation. Underwriter spread impacts initial underpricing for a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> medium-reputation <b>underwriters,</b> while underpricing affects <b>underwriter</b> spread for <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> low- and high-reputation underwriters. Consequently, high-risk IPOs may not be priced {{the same way as}} low-risk IPOs. We attribute this finding to regulation, competition, and/or market segmentation.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} examines IPO underpricing {{and long-term}} performance {{to assess the}} use of industry specialization as a differentiation strategy by audit firms and underwriters. Prior studies indicate that prestigious auditors or underwriters (e. g., Big 6 auditors) are associated with IPO underpricing. I extend existing literature by incorporating market share as a refined measure <b>of</b> auditor (<b>underwriter)</b> reputation. In particular, I define a differentiated auditor (underwriter) as the market leader that possesses significantly higher market share than their competitors in the client industry. I hypothesize that the impact <b>of</b> auditor (<b>underwriter)</b> reputation in the IPO setting depends on whether the audit firm (underwriter) has successfully differentiated itself from competitors within client industries. My results show that as audit firm (underwriter) industry market share increases without differentiation, the IPO underpricing increases. It appears that this <b>group</b> <b>of</b> auditors (<b>underwriters)</b> intentionally engages in high-risk IPOs {{in order to gain}} fee advantages. In contrast, differentiated auditors (underwriters) are related to lower IPO underpricing because their reputation assist in reducing information asymmetry between issuers and investors. My study is important because it shows that the benefits previously thought to be attributable to a very large set <b>of</b> auditors and <b>underwriters</b> stems primar...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{cost structure}} comprising of both {{direct and indirect}} costs for 109 IPOs listed on Indian stock markets during the sample time period January 2004 to May 2006, providing benchmark numbers for their further usage. It also makes an attempt to gauge relationship between IPO size and costs and discover cost differentials existing in the indian market {{on the basis of}} industry difference and the type <b>of</b> <b>underwriter</b> hired. This is carried out through the usage of six OLS regression models with size as a numeric independent variable and industry and underwriter acting as dummy independent variables regressed on dependant variables direct and indirect costs individually. The results showcase existence of lower direct costs in indian markets as compared to global developed markets. These direct costs not only seem to hold a negative relationship with the issue size but also vary significantly for different industries. These costs are observed to be lower for clients <b>of</b> foreign <b>underwriters</b> as compared to clients of other types <b>of</b> <b>underwriters.</b> Indirect costs on the other hand are quite high in indian markets as compared to other developed markets and they are well spread across different industries and different types <b>of</b> <b>underwriters.</b> High indirect cost is necessary for any issue to be successful in indian markets irrespective of size of an issue, industry or investment bank hired to manage the issue. Thus total costs incurred in indian markets are higher than developed markets as marginally lower direct costs are compensated by higher than average indirect costs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{an optimal}} underwriter participation model and develops testable hypotheses regarding {{the influence of}} certain factors on the degree <b>of</b> <b>underwriter</b> participation in initial public offerings (IPOs) of common stock. The issue <b>of</b> <b>underwriter</b> participation is important primarily due to the tradeoff between foregone underwriter compensation and underwriting risk reduction. The results of this paper indicate that factors related to the issue, issuing firm, underwriter, and IPO market conditions all are important determinants of the participation decision. Interestingly, the results also show {{that the importance of}} these factors is not consistent across underwriter prestige groups. In particular, factors external to underwriters (e. g., the issuing firm and market characteristics) are more important for explaining nonprestigious underwriter participation, while factors related to underwriters themselves play a more important role for explaining prestigious underwriter participation.

Issuers that state general corporate purposes and recapitalisation motives underperform, have similar investment rates pre- and post-issue, and their leverage tends to increase after the offering. Further, consistent with the certifying role <b>of</b> <b>underwriters,</b> equity issues underwritten by high-quality brokers show no evidence of post-issue abnormal returns, but offerings taken public by low-quality underwriters exhibit negative abnormal performance. Together, our results document the significant role that prospectus information on the intended use of offering proceeds and on the underwriter play in predicting issuers post-offering performance in the UK...|$|R
