5|$|Although {{historically}} the U.S. {{state of}} Connecticut is not typically known to fall casualty to tornadoes, more than 100 of these powerful storms <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> <b>the</b> state in modern history, resulting {{in at least}} 48deaths, 780injuries, and more than $500million in damage. This list of tornadoes in the state is likely incomplete, as official records date back only to 1950 for tornadoes in the United States.|$|E
5|$|From 1953 to 1991, Connecticut {{recorded}} {{an average}} of about 1.3tornadoes per year, ranked 43rd in the United States. Although Connecticut tornadoes are typically weak, isolated events can be violent. Three tornadoes of F4 intensity <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> <b>the</b> state in its history, as well as at least 27 tornadoes of F2 intensity or greater. Outbreaks of three or more tornadoes in a single day occurred in 1786, 1787, 1878, 1973, 1989, 1998, and 2001. The year 1973was particularly active; eight tornadoes occurred on six separate days. The 1878 Wallingford tornado killed at least 29 and likely 34 people in Wallingford, the most by any tornado event in Connecticut history.|$|E

The roads reopened after the lake's waters receded enough to allow Department of Transportation inspectors to check the three bridges over the water.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, Gyeongju has {{followed}} the same trends that <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> <b>the</b> rest of South Korea. Like {{the country as a}} whole, Gyeongju has seen its population age and the size of families shrink. For instance, the mean household size is 2.8 people. Because this has fallen in recent years, there are more households in the city as of 2008 (105,009) than there were in 2003, even though the population has fallen.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, many people assumed Jack Fingleton, the only full-time journalist on either team, was responsible. This belief may <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> <b>the</b> {{course of his}} subsequent career. Fingleton later wrote that Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman and the primary target of Bodyline, was the person who disclosed the story. Bradman always denied this, and continued to blame Fingleton; animosity between the pair continued {{for the rest of}} their lives. Woodfull's earlier public silence on the tactics had been interpreted as approval; the leak was significant in persuading the Australian public that Bodyline was unacceptable.|$|E

5|$|North Carolina is a U.S. state {{located on}} the Atlantic Seaboard in the southeastern United States. Tropical cyclones—storms {{characterized}} by a large low-pressure center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rain—regularly affect the state. According to statistical hurricane research between 1886 and 1996 by the North Carolina State Climatology Office, a tropical cyclone makes landfall along the coastline about once every four years. An estimated 17.5% of all North Atlantic tropical cyclones <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> <b>the</b> state.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare almost {{certainly}} wrote {{the role of}} Hamlet for Richard Burbage. He was the chief tragedian of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, with a capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range. Judging {{by the number of}} reprints, Hamlet appears to have been Shakespeare's fourth most popular play during his lifetime—only Henry IV Part 1, Richard III and Pericles eclipsed it. Shakespeare provides no clear indication of when his play is set; however, as Elizabethan actors performed at the Globe in contemporary dress on minimal sets, this would not <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> <b>the</b> staging.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} tropical cyclone {{to affect the}} area that is now the state of Florida occurred in 1523, when two ships and their crews were lost along the western coastline. A total 159 hurricanes are known to <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> <b>the</b> state prior to 1900, which collectively resulted in at least 6,504 fatalities and monetary damage of over $102million (2017USD). Additionally, at least 109 boats or ships were either driven ashore, wrecked, or damaged due to the storms. A strong hurricane struck northwest Florida on May 28, 1863, and is the earliest landfall during the year known in the US.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} tropical cyclones that affected the U.S. state of Delaware. Since reliable records began, no tropical cyclone has struck the state while maintaining hurricane intensity, and only two storms since 1851 caused hurricane-force winds in the state. The state often experiences the direct effects of landfalling North Atlantic tropical cyclones and from the remnants of some Pacific storms, such as rainfall or strong winds, as well as the effects of storms that remain offshore, such as rip currents or heavy surf. Since 1749, at least 111tropical cyclones, some of which had become extratropical, <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> <b>the</b> state, including 21 which passed over the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{period from}} 2000 {{to the present}} was marked by several devastating North Atlantic hurricanes; , 79 {{tropical}} or subtropical cyclones <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> <b>the</b> U.S. state of Florida. Collectively, cyclones in Florida over that period resulted in over $73 billion in damage (2017USD). Additionally, tropical cyclones in Florida were responsible for 147 direct fatalities and at least 92 indirect ones during the period. Eight cyclones affected the state in both 2003 and 2005, which were the years with the most tropical cyclones impacting the state. Every year included at least one tropical cyclone affecting the state.|$|E
5|$|According to the Bermuda Weather Service, {{the islands}} of Bermuda {{experience}} a damaging tropical cyclone once every six to seven years, on average. Due to the small area of the island chain, landfalls and direct hits are rare. Strictly speaking, only nine landfalls have occurred during years included in the official Atlantic hurricane database, starting in 1851. When hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo struck Bermuda just days apart in October 2014, that season became the first to produce two landfalls. Two damaging storms impacted Bermuda in September 1899, but {{the center of the}} first storm narrowly missed the islands. Tropical cyclones, and their antecedent or remnant weather systems, <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> <b>the</b> territory in all seasons, most frequently in the late summer months. A study of recorded storms from 1609 to 1996 found that direct hits from hurricanes were most common in early September and late October, with an intervening relative lull creating two distinct 'seasons'.|$|E
