40|$|International audienceThe {{simulation}} of acoustic phenomena using urban street scale models requires {{the use of}} a small and powerfull sound sources with a wide frequency bandwidth and omnidirectional radiation. Among different source types able to provide these characteristics, spark discharge in air is an interesting solution. The principle is based on the generation of an electric discharge by applying a high voltage between two electrodes. First the gas becomes electrically conducting, the electric current heats up the gas, causing the formation of an impulsive sound signal. These sources have been also widely used for shock wave propagation, like sonic boom, for which propagation is non linear. However, the behaviour of spark discharges and their acoustic radiation depend greatly on the <b>electrodes</b> <b>gap.</b> As very little investigation has been done of this dependance, this work provides a detailled characterisation of a spark discharge in function of the <b>electrodes</b> <b>gap.</b> Electrical characteristics, repeatability, acoustic characteristics and the limits between linear and non linear propagation domains are studied in function of various <b>electrodes</b> <b>gaps.</b> This experimental study is meant to be a useful resource for experimenters to design a spark discharge adapted to their specific applications...|$|R

An arc in gases near atmospheric pressure is characterized by visible light emission, high current density, and high temperature. An arc is distinguished from a glow discharge partly by the approximately equal effective temperatures of both electrons and positive ions; but in a glow discharge, ions have much less thermal energy than the electrons.|$|E

5000|$|The alloy {{to undergo}} VAR is formed into a {{cylinder}} typically by vacuum induction melting (VIM) or ladle refining (airmelt). This cylinder, {{referred to as}} an electrode is then put into a large cylindrical enclosed crucible and brought to a metallurgical vacuum (...) [...] At {{the bottom of the}} crucible is a small amount of the alloy to be remelted, which the top electrode is brought close to prior to starting the melt. Several kiloamperes of DC current are used to start an arc between the two pieces, and from there, a continuous melt is derived. The crucible (typically made of copper) is surrounded by a water jacket used to cool the melt and control the solidification rate. To prevent arcing between the electrode and the crucible side walls, the diameter of the crucible is larger than that of the electrode.

50|$|In a {{photoconductive}} emitter, {{the optical}} laser pulse (100 femtoseconds or shorter) creates carriers (electron-hole pairs) in a semiconductor material. Effectively, the semiconductor changes abruptly {{from being an}} insulator into being a conductor. This conduction leads to a sudden electric current across a biased antenna patterned on the semiconductor. This changing current emits terahertz radiation, similar to {{what happens in the}} antenna of a radio transmitter.Typically the two antenna electrodes are patterned on a low temperature gallium arsenide (LT-GaAs), semi-insulating gallium arsenide (SI-GaAs), or other semiconductor (such as InP) substrate.In a commonly used scheme, the electrodes are formed into the shape of a simple dipole antenna with a gap of a few micrometers and have a bias voltage up to 40 V between them. The ultrafast (100 fs) laser pulse must have a wavelength that is short enough to excite electrons across the bandgap of the semiconductor substrate. This scheme is suitable for illumination with a Ti:sapphire oscillator laser with pulse energies of about 10 nJ.

In addition to improved insulation, the technology requires better bonding methods between TiB2 and the bulk graphite electrode substrate. Bonding tiles of TiB2 or applying composite coatings each present their own unique challenges, with the high cost and large TiB2 capital cost of the former and the design difficulty of the latter. Composite materials must have each component degrade at the same rate, or the wettability and thermal conductivity of the surface will be lost with active material still remaining deeper within the electrode plate.|$|E

40|$|Pseudospark-sourced {{electron}} beam is a self-focused intense {{electron beam}} which can propagate without any external focusing magnetic field. This electron beam can drive a beam-wave interaction directly or after being post-accelerated. It is especially suitable for terahertz (THz) radiation generation {{due to the}} ability of a pseudospark discharge to produce small size in the micron range and very high current density and bright electron beams. In this paper, a single-gap pseudospark discharge chamber has been built and tested with several <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> separations to explore the dependence of the pseudospark-sourced electron beam current on the discharge voltage and the <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> separation. Experimental results show that the beam pulses have similar pulse width and delay time from the distinct drop of the applied voltage for smaller <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> separations but longer delay time for the largest gap separation used in the experiment. It has been found that the electron beam only starts to occur when the charging voltage is above a certain value, which is defined as the starting voltage of the electron beam.

At the high melting currents (30 to 40 kA) typically used for VAR of segregation insensitive Ti and Zr alloys, process voltage is used {{as an indicator of}} <b>electrode</b> <b>gap,</b> whereas drip-short frequency (or period) is usually used at the lower currents (5 to 8 kA) employed during VAR of superalloys. Modem controllers adjust electrode position or drive velocity to maintain a voltage or drip-short frequency (or period) set-point.
