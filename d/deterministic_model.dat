25|$|Whether people {{naturally}} {{adhere to}} an incompatibilist model {{of free will}} has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive – it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a <b>deterministic</b> <b>model</b> of reality). Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive – it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general. Joshua Knobe and Shaun Nichols have proposed that incompatibilism {{may or may not}} be intuitive, and that it is dependent to some large degree upon the circumstances; whether or not the crime incites an emotional response – for example if it involves harming another human being. They found that belief in free will is a cultural universal, and that the majority of participants said that (a) our universe is indeterministic and (b) moral responsibility is not compatible with determinism.|$|E

The deviations in {{means and standard}} deviations of stochastic and <b>deterministic</b> <b>models</b> are studied considering the saturated hydraulic conductivity and Van Genuchten soil parameter 'n' as random variables. It is shown that the randomness in saturated hydraulic conductivity has a pronounced effect on the deviation in the means of the stochastic and <b>deterministic</b> <b>models</b> whereas the randomness in parameter 'n' has little effect. It is also shown that the cross correlation between the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the parameter 'n' has little effect on the deviations in means of stochastic and <b>deterministic</b> <b>models.</b> However, the cross correlation has significantly reduced the deviations in standard deviation between the stochastic and <b>deterministic</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R

Two projects show that <b>deterministic</b> CPS <b>models</b> with faithful physical realizations are possible and practical. The first project is PRET, which shows that the timing precision of synchronous digital logic can be practically made available at the software level of abstraction.

In any case it must be stressed that this formula is only valid over a limited time period. It is a polynomial expression centred on the J2000 datum, empirically fitted to observational data, not on a <b>deterministic</b> <b>model</b> of the solar system. It is clear that if T gets large enough (far in the future or far in the past), the T² term will dominate and p will go to very large values. In reality, more elaborate calculations on the numerical model of the Solar System show that the precessional constants have a period of about 41,000 years, the same as the obliquity of the ecliptic.

30|$|The goal of <b>deterministic</b> <b>models</b> is to {{represent}} {{the characteristics of a}} specific scenario with high accuracy and to include all basic propagation mechanisms. Consequently, <b>deterministic</b> <b>models</b> are characterized by the need for detailed site-specific information and large computation efforts. Two classes of <b>deterministic</b> <b>models</b> have been reported in literature. Finite-difference time-domain models try to replace Maxwell’s differential equations with finite-difference equations, thus exhibiting a certain degree of abstraction. Geometry models rely on geometric rays that interact with the specified objects and are also referred to as ray-tracing models [59, 60]. Due to the fundamental dependency on site-specific information, it is difficult to draw general conclusions from the attained results.|$|R

40|$|At {{the conference}} on "Energy Systems" that was held in Baden July 17 - 20, 1973, the {{discussion}} regarding models and model-building was, for the most part, limited to <b>deterministic</b> <b>models.</b> Only {{at the end of}} the conference, in the discussion of "risk and reliability problems," was the question of <b>deterministic</b> <b>models</b> versus probabilistic models brought up. The brief discussion that ensued indicated that there exists some hesitancy on the part of model builders in the energy systems area to include probabilities in their models. Such model builders recognize the presence of uncertainty in the situations they are modeling, but they appear to feel uncomfortable about formally representing this uncertainty in terms of probabilities. This uncomfortable feeling may be due to several factors, including a lack of familiarity with probabilistic models, a question about the source of probabilities for probabilistic models, a feeling that <b>deterministic</b> <b>models</b> are perfectly adequate, and a concern that probabilistic models regarding energy systems would be too complex and difficult to handle. Unfortunately, because the question of <b>deterministic</b> <b>models</b> versus probabilistic models arose so late in the conference, adequate time was not available for a full discussion of the question. Of course, a full discussion would require several days with many papers and presentations. Since that is not immediately feasible, this paper represents an attempt to present an overview of some of the issues that are involved in the question of <b>deterministic</b> <b>models</b> versus probabilistic models...|$|R
