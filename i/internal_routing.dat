2500|$|For {{the purpose}} of network management, an IP address {{is divided into two}} logical parts, the network prefix and the host {{identifier}} or rest field. All hosts on a subnetwork have the same network prefix. This routing prefix occupies the most-significant bits of the address. The number of bits allocated within a network to the <b>internal</b> <b>routing</b> prefix may vary between subnets, depending on the network architecture. [...] While in IPv6 the prefix must consist of a set of contiguous 1-bits, in IPv4 this is not enforced, though there is no advantage to using non-contiguous 1-bits. The host part is a unique local identification and is either a host number on the local network or an interface identifier.|$|E

50|$|BIRD {{implements}} an <b>internal</b> <b>routing</b> {{table to}} which the supported protocols connect. Most of these protocols import network routes to this <b>internal</b> <b>routing</b> table and also export network routes from this <b>internal</b> <b>routing</b> table to the given protocol. This way information about network routes is exchanged among different routing protocols.|$|E
50|$|Using the kernel {{protocol}} this <b>internal</b> <b>routing</b> table may {{be connected}} to the actual kernel routing table. This allows BIRD to export network routes from its <b>internal</b> <b>routing</b> table to the kernel routing table and optionally also learn about network routes from the kernel routing table (created externally by the administrator or by other means) and import these routes into its <b>internal</b> <b>routing</b> table.|$|E

Done properly, even heavy serial compression can sound natural in a way not possible with a single compressor. It is most often used to even out erratic vocals and guitars.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{growing number}} of {{applications}} create overlays {{on top of the}} Internet. Several unsolved issues at the network layer can explain this trend to implement network services such as multicast, mobility and security at the application layer. However overlays require some form of <b>internal</b> addressing, <b>routing</b> and naming. Therefore their topologies are usually kept simple but this limits their flexibility and scalability. Our aim is to design an efficient and robust addressing, routing and naming framework for complex overlays. Our only assumption is that they are constrained by the Internet topology. Applications using our framework will be relieved from managing their own overlay topologies. This paper presents our framework in detail as well as some performance results concerning its routing efficiency, its reliability to network dynamics and its naming scalability. I...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{matrices}} play {{a pivotal}} role in the management of an ISP’s network such as various levels of traffic engineering and capacity planning. However, it is unclear how the interaction between the <b>internal</b> traffic <b>routing</b> policies chosen by the ISPs and large-scale content providers, and the ongoing trend of “cloud-computing ” affect the traffic matrices. In this paper, we use network data collected by a Tier- 1 ISP to understand the characteristics of a PoP-level traffic matrix. We also shed light on the role of “routing matrix ” in shaping the characteristics of the traffic matrix. Two of the most important observations in this study are: a) multi-exit prefixes and use of early-exit routing are the major reasons why PoP level traffic for the large ISPs do not follow the gravity model(i. e. proportional distribution based on size) as assumed by previous works, and b) routing plays a fundamental role in shaping the traffic matrix. 1...|$|R
30|$|The BCM {{can be used}} to {{identify}} locations and climatic conditions that generate excess water by quantifying the amount of water available either as runoff generated throughout a basin or as in-place recharge (Flint and Flint 2007). Because of the grid-based, simplified nature of the model, with no <b>internal</b> streamflow <b>routing,</b> long time series for very large areas can be simulated easily. However, if local unimpaired streamflow data are available, estimated recharge and runoff from each grid cell {{can be used to}} calculate basin discharge that can be extrapolated through time for varying climates. In addition, the application of the model across landscapes allows for grid-based comparisons between different areas. Because of the modular and mechanistic approach used by the BCM, it is flexible with respect to incorporating new input data or updating of algorithms should better calculations be derived. All input files necessary to operate the BCM, and the output files resulting from the simulations, are shown in Thorne et al. (2012; Appendix A). A complete list of all input and output variables and definitions is included in Thorne et al. (2012; Appendix B).|$|R
50|$|Redundancy {{can thus}} be {{provided}} by using two such units per surface, and two sets of electrical wires. This is far simpler than the corresponding systems using an external hydraulic supply. Additionally, the EHA has the advantage that it only draws power when it is being moved, the pressure is maintained internally when the motor stops. This can reduce power use on the aircraft by eliminating the constant draw of the hydraulic pumps. EHAs also reduce weight, allow better streamlining due to reduced <b>internal</b> <b>routing</b> of piping, and lower overall weight of the control system.|$|E

A large manufacturer with factories and offices in multiple cities may use a prefix (such as '8') followed by an <b>internal</b> <b>routing</b> code to indicate a city or location, then an individual four- or five-digit extension number at the destination site. A common trunk prefix for an outside line on North American systems is the digit 9, followed by the outside destination number.|$|E

Clustering of devices in MANET could reduce overhead, flooding and collision in communication and make the network topology more stable. The ABC (Artificial Bee Colony) algorithm is a new meta-heuristic population based optimization technique inspired by the intelligent foraging behavior of honeybee swarms. In this paper, a new general framework has been proposed for achieving QoS which provides a cluster based routing and applies Artificial Bee Colony optimization Technique for effective optimal route discovery in MANET. It works {{on the principle of}} collective intelligence and emergence of artificial honey bees. It's application in ad-hoc networks involves swarming agents (honey bees) hopping node to node, analyzing a set of variables exposed by the nodes and provide the optimal path and minimize the routing overhead and also provides QoS guarantees with an ability for minimal end-to-end delay and enhanced scalability...|$|R

This paper secures both public and shared keys routing control, which can be generated on-demand and maintained dynamically.
