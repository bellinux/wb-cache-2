40|$|AbstractWhereas {{integration}} of shape and surround is held to occur through cue-dependent representations, {{we show that}} both cue-invariant and cue-dependent representations are involved. A central hinged plane and larger flanking plane <b>were</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> either binocular disparity or motion. In a ‘within-cue’ condition, shape and surround <b>were</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> the same cue and in a ‘cross-cue’ condition they <b>were</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> a different cue. Observers compared the dihedral angle of the central shape with a constant reference. When the central shape <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> disparity, the surround stimuli invoked a contrast bias in the within-cue condition, but shape assimilation occurred in the cross-cue condition. When the central shape <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> motion there <b>were</b> overall no significant results, but if a contrast bias was observed, {{it was in the}} within-cue condition where integration could occur through cue-dependent representations...|$|R

5|$|The {{extent of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons {{of the solar}} wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind {{is greater than the}} speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring current <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetosphere}} is {{the region}} above the ionosphere that <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> {{the extent of}} the Earth's magnetic field in space.
