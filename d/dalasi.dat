50|$|The <b>dalasi</b> is the {{currency}} of the Gambia. It is subdivided into 100 bututs. The <b>dalasi</b> was adopted in 1971. It replaced the Gambian pound {{at a rate of}} 1 pound = 5 dalasis, i.e., 1 <b>dalasi</b> = 0.2 pound = 4 shillings.|$|E
50|$|The Gambian pound was the {{currency}} of the Gambia between 1965 and 1971. Gambia used the British West African pound until it issued its own currency on October 5, 1964. In 1971, the <b>dalasi</b> replaced the pound {{at a rate of}} 1 pound = 5 <b>dalasi,</b> i.e., 1 <b>dalasi</b> = 4 shillings. One Gambian pound was made up of 20 shillings, each shilling being made up of 12 pence.|$|E
50|$|New 1 <b>dalasi</b> coins were {{introduced}} in 1987, modelled on the 50 pence coin of the United Kingdom. These replaced the larger, round <b>dalasi</b> coins which never saw its widespread use as the lower denominations.|$|E

50|$|The Central Bank of The Gambia {{took over}} assets and {{liabilities}} of The Gambia Currency Board in 1971 and a new decimal currency was introduced to replace the Gambian pound. The new currency was the <b>Dalasi</b> with 1 <b>Dalasi</b> being subdivided into 100 Bututs. Again, the coins were minted by the Royal Mint and the notes were printed by Bradbury Wilkinson & Co. Ltd.|$|E

50|$|In 1998, a new {{coin series}} was introduced, {{in which the}} effigy of Dawda Jawara was dropped and {{replaced}} with the national coat of arms on the obverses. However, older Jawara era coins still commonly circulate as legal tender. The 1 <b>dalasi</b> coin was also downsized in size and weight, {{but none of the}} other coins were changed. Only 25 and 50 bututs and 1 <b>dalasi</b> coins are currently in circulation, they are of the 1998 issue which also included 1, 5 and 10 bututs coins but have since disappeared due to low valuation.|$|E

50|$|In 1971, {{coins in}} {{denominations}} of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 bututs and 1 <b>dalasi</b> were introduced. The 1 and 5 bututs were struck in bronze while the 10 bututs was brass and the 25, 50 bututs and 1 <b>dalasi</b> were cupro-nickel. The reverse designs {{of the three}} higher denominations {{were taken from the}} corresponding denominations of the previous currency (1, 2 and 4 shillings), with the reverse designs for the lower three coins coming from the 6, 1 and 3 pence coins, respectively. All coins of this series depict former president, Sir Dawda Jawara.|$|E
50|$|On December 8, 1720, <b>Dalasi,</b> the Datu of Butig (also {{known as}} Rajah Janatun of Butig), with an armada {{of one hundred}} vessels or “paraws” manned by Sultan sa Kanluran, Miyangaludan and several {{thousand}} Moros, attacked Fort Pilar in Zamboanga. He captured a local Jesuit priest and forced the Spanish government in Manila to give ransom payment {{in exchange for his}} freedom. (Hurley, 1936) But the accuracy of this report by Hurley is in doubt considering the distance of Butig (Lanao del Sur) to the shores of Zamboanga. Furthermore, the Jesuits in Zamboanga were more engaged with the Tausugs of Sulu; and for Datu <b>Dalasi,</b> a Maranao of Lanao, {{to get involved in the}} affairs of the Sulu Sultanate is highly unusual.|$|E

According to the charge sheet brought against him, {{he was accused of}} seditious intention. Media reports of the event cite the attempt by state forces to stifle the media. His arrest and bail (in 200,000 Gambian <b>dalasi,</b> corresponding to about USD 9500) coincided with the conviction and sentencing of Fatou Jaw Manneh, another journalist who was found guilty of a 2005 article.|$|E
50|$|In 1718-1719, it was rebuilt by the Spaniard {{engineer}} Juan Sicarra {{upon the}} orders of Spanish Governor General Fernando Manuel de Bustillo Bustamante y Rueda and was renamed as Real Fuerza de Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Zaragoza (Royal Fort of Our Lady of the Pillar of Zaragoza) {{in honor of the}} patron virgin of Spain, Our Lady of the Pillar. A year after, it was stormed by <b>Dalasi,</b> king of Bulig and 3,000 Moro pirates but they were repulsed. In 1798, the fort was bombarded by British troops, but again it proved robust enough to repel strong military attacks. Fort Pilar was the scene of a mutiny of 70 prisoners in 1872.|$|E
50|$|Banknotes {{currently}} in circulation are 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 dalasis. 1 <b>dalasi</b> notes were issued between 1971 and 1987. Current banknotes were first issued on 27 July 1996, then reprinted in 2001. On 27 July 2006, the Central Bank of the Gambia issued {{a new series}} of notes with images similar to the preceding issues, but with improvements in the design, paper thickness, and security features. Most noticeably, the old white borders have been removed. Furthermore, the 5- and 10-dalasi are coated with a special varnish to extend circulation life. Finally, the security features of the 100-dalasi have been upgraded by the inclusion of a silver foil {{on the front of the}} note with the image of 100 embossed into the foil.|$|E
5000|$|President Dawda Jawara {{established}} {{relations with}} the DPRK in March 1973, having first reassured South Korea that the move - {{in line with the}} country's non-aligned policies - would not interfere with ties to Seoul. A Gambian delegation visited both Koreas later the same year - the tour of DPRK strained the Gambian delegates, who described the [...] "incessant period of political education on the Korean unification problem from the ideological perspective of North Korean officials" [...] they had to go through as tiring. In Joint Communiques signed at the end of both visits, the Gambia expressed its full support for a peaceful reunification of the peninsula without outside involvement. A DPRK mission was subsequently opened in Banjul in July 1975, and the country contributed 203,235 Gambian <b>dalasi</b> towards drought relief.|$|E
40|$|This study employs Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) {{to explore}} the level of {{exchange}} rate volatility in West African Monetary Zone for the period 1980 - 2014. Our empirical findings reveal that the Gambian <b>dalasi</b> experiences the least volatile official exchange rate while the Liberia dollar is the most volatile in the Zone. There is need for government of Gambia and Nigeria to control overshooting dynamics experienced by <b>dalasi</b> and naira. All the countries should exercise monetary and fiscal measures on time to put their exchange rate volatility under check...|$|E
40|$|This paper models the {{exchange}} rate volatility in the Gambian foreign exchange rates data. Financial time series models that combined autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and generalized conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) was explored theoritically and applied to the daily Euro and US dollars (USD) exchange rates against the Gambian <b>Dalasi</b> (GMD) from 2003 through 2013. Based on Akaike information criteria, the ARMA(1, 1) -GARCH(1, 1) and ARMA(2, 1) -GARCH(1, 1) were judged the best fitting models to the Euro/GMD and USD/GMD return series respectively. Our empirical results revealed that {{the distribution of the}} return series was heavy-tailed and volatility was highly persistent in the Gambian foreign exchange market...|$|E
40|$|This study employs {{measures}} of variability and three GARCH models to comparatively explore the behaviour of {{exchange rate volatility}} of the currencies in the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) for the period 1960 M 01 - 2011 M 12. The study selects a sub-sample period of 2000 M 1 to 2011 M 12 to investigate whether central bank intervention decreases volatility of the local currencies per US$. Our findings reveal that the Ghanaian cedi is the most volatile currency in the Zone. Also, we found that leverage effect does exist for Gambian <b>dalasi,</b> while it does not exist for Nigerian naira; but inconclusive for other countries. The impact of central bank intervention on exchange rate volatility is also found to be inconclusive for Ghana, Guinea, and Liberia. However, the impact of central bank intervention on foreign exchange decreases the level of volatility persistence in Gambia and Nigeria, while it increases the level of volatility persistence in Sierra Leone for the period under consideration...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{empirical}} {{assessment of the}} readiness of The Gambia for regional integration and {{is presented in two}} studies. The first is on the optimality of the Sene-Gambia sub-region as a currency area and the second is on trade facilitation effects of the Sene-Gambia Confederation on The Gambian economy. The first study uses three methods to determine the optimality of the Sene-Gambia as a currency area. The first method is a reduced VAR to examine the response of the Senegalese and The Gambian economies to external shocks emanating from France, the United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (USA). The second method is a co-integration analysis on Generalized Purchasing Power Parity (GPPP) to determine the existence of a co-integrating relationship between the exchange rates of the Gambian <b>dalasi</b> and Senegalese CFA franc and their consumer price indices. The third method assesses the similarity between the two economies as countries wishing to form an optimal currency area should not be diametrically different in their economic structure or else the relationship would not be mutually beneficial and the resulting union may not be stable. The results support the optimality of Sene-Gambia as a currency area. Given this optimality, the second study uses an error-corrected gravity model to determine the trade facilitation effects of the Sene-Gambia Confederation on The Gambian economy. It also looks at the significance of financial deepening, a proxy for supply-side constraints, to The Gambian economy. Credit to the private sector measures the level of financial sector deepening in The Gambia. The study finds that the Sene-Gambia Confederation had positive trade facilitation effects for The Gambia and that financial deepening is statistically a significant policy instrument for trade in The Gambia...|$|E
40|$|Rationale for the study: The Maternal Mortality Ratio was {{estimated}} to 690 / 100 000 in 2005. This lies above the average for the other countries with comparable income. (8) To reduce the MMR {{it is vital to}} increase the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel. Currently, there is {{a significant difference in the}} socio economic status of the women who deliver with a skilled attendant, and those who do not. The total user costs may affect the use of health services and in order to improve the women’s access to maternity care, it is essential both to identify what these costs are and to investigate means of reducing the cost for the most vulnerable in the Gambia. Objectives: The objectives were to estimate the total household cost for deliveries in a health facility, to explore to what extent households opt out of institutional delivery services due to high cost, to look into the characteristics of the households that opted out of public delivery services due to cost and to look into the financial strategies of households to cope with health emergencies. Materials and methods: This is a quantitative and observational study with both analytical and exploratory components. The study was conducted in Upper River Division and Central River Division of the Gambia between August and November 2007. Interviews were held of 323 women that had delivered a baby between January to July the same year and that lived in the catchment area of 4 preselected health centres. A total of 17 villages were selected by convenience and all eligible women in the village were interviewed using a structured questionnaire Results: The median total cost when the user fee and transport is included {{was estimated}} at 112 <b>Dalasi.</b> The user fee is about 45 % of this cost and transport is the second major expense at 22 %. Removing the user fee as is now done in the Gambia will thus clearly change the price of utilizing the health facilities for deliveries. ‘Poor’ households frequent the health facilities less than households with a higher consumption capacity. However, only 13 % of home deliveries claimed they did not use the health facility due to cost. Other risk factors for delivering at home were distance, previous experience with perinatal death and low education. More than half of the women that delivered in a health facility did not have cash available when leaving for the facility, and mostly borrowed money to be able to pay – the ‘poorer’ families more than the others. Conclusion: Removing the user fee is a great step towards improving access to maternity services. However, efforts should still be made on getting delivery services ‘closer’ to the population- either by improving the availability of low cost transport or by further decentralizing appropriate obstetric care facilities...|$|E
