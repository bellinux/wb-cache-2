5000|$|Popular tear gases {{include the}} eye {{irritants}} ortho-chlorobenzylidene-malononitrile (CS gas), chloroacetophenone (CN gas), and <b>dibenz</b> (b,f)-1,4-oxazepine (CR gas). Among {{a long list}} of substances, these three have become of greater importance than the others because of their effectiveness and low risks when used. Today, CS has largely replaced CN as the most widely used tear gas internationally.|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} a historical {{background on the}} use of tear gases in war and civilian riot control activity. The classification of chemical compounds used as irritants, and their structure - activity relationship established through different studies has been examined. A review of toxic effects which is different from irritancy of Adamsite, w- chloroacetophenone (CN), o-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS) and <b>Dibenz</b> (b,f), [1, 4] - oxazepine (CR) has been presented...|$|E
40|$|A facile, green {{approach}} for {{the synthesis of}} some new dibenz[1, 4]-diazepine- 1 -one by a three component reaction of Diamine, 1, 3 diketone and aromatic aldehyde using oxalic acid as catalyst in water is described. The products are formed in good yields (92 – 94 %). Newly synthesized <b>dibenz</b> [1, 4]-diazepine- 1 -one analogues were evaluated for the anxiolytic activity by the elevated plus maze method. From the activity data {{it is observed that}} compounds, 4 g, 4 h and 4 k show promising anxiolytic activity...|$|E
40|$|The article {{reports the}} {{application}} of PUF (polyurethane foam) for PAHs sampling in water. The technique {{is found to be}} suitable for the sampling of PAHs and other trace organics in different water samples. The DL(detection limit) for pyrene-d 10 in 1 L water is 26 ng/L when GC/MS is used for analysis. Much lower MDLs can be achieved when HPLC-Fluorescence is used for PAH analysis. The observed MDLs for benzo (k) fluoranthene, benzo (a) pyrene, <b>dibenz</b> (a,h) anthracene and benzo(ghi) perylene in 1 L water are 0. 86, 0. 56, 2. 1, 3. 0 ng/L respectively. HPLC-Fluorescence analysis also gives very litter background interference by PUF. PUF sampling coupled with HPLC-fluorescence analysis is therefore promising method for the measurement of ultratrace levels of PAHs in aquatic environment...|$|E
40|$|Three human {{hepatocyte}} {{cultures have}} been developed from spec-imens of normal human liver, in each case from an infant or child, by coculture with liver epithelial cells from 6 -day-old rat pups in a complex growth medium. In the established cultures hepatocytes predominate and maintain typical hepatocellular morphology by light microscopy and albumin secretion into supematant medium. The activity of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and methoxyreso-rufin 0 -demethylase (MROD) basally and after treatment with poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was measured spectrofluorometncally in cell homogenates from each culture. Very low levels of EROD and MROD activity were found in each culture without induction [EROD: 1. 78 ± 0. 71 (mean ± SE) pmol/min/mg protein; MROD: 1. 33 ± 0. 10 pmol/min/mg protein]. After treatment with 10 MM <b>dibenz</b> (a,h) anthracene x 48 hr, EROD and MROD activities rose approxi-mately 20 - to 50 -fold. When the basal and induced enzyme activitie...|$|E
40|$|Rats {{were exposed}} to a heavy dosage of the sensory {{irritant}} <b>dibenz</b> (b. f.) - 1, 4 oxazepine (CR). No change in the lung surfactant could be detected by the methods used. Electron micrography showed that the ordinary lamellated osmiophilic bodies (LOPBs) and their precursors were unaffected. Bodies containing both mitochondrial cristae and dense osmiophilic whorls (“mitochondrial lamellated bodies”, or MLBs) {{were found in the}} type II cells of some animals up to 15 days after the exposure. These whorls originate from the bounding membranes and cristae; serial sections show that they usually abut on the boundary of the organelle. A large proportion of the mitochondria in any cell may be affected by this process. Unequivocal evidence that the MLBs finally evolve into LOPBs without cristae was not obtained in this series; the ultimate fate of the MLBs and the cells containing them is uncertain. The MLBs may perhaps act as an emergency source of surfactant...|$|E
40|$|Three {{groups of}} 18 animals were exposed {{respectively}} {{to the following}} large doses of <b>dibenz</b> (b. f) - 1 : 4 oxazepine (CR) aerosols, 78, 200, 140, 900 and 161, 300 mg/min/m 3. Animals were killed at intervals from 15 min to 2 days, and the lungs examined macroscopically, by electron microscopy and conventional histology. There were no deaths during or after exposure. Macroscopically the lungs from all rats appeared normal. Microscopically {{there were a few}} areas of mild congestion, haemorrhage and emphysema, but there was little variation between the different groups. Electron micrographs revealed some morphological alteration of the epithelium and endothelium but only occasional changes in the interstitium. The alterations took the form of "ballooning" of the endothelium with isolated foci of swelling and thickening of the epithelium. Interstitial oedema was observed in one animal only which was exposed to the highest concentration. The effects appeared similar in all groups, and are thought to be transient. The results of this investigation suggest that even high doses of CR aerosols cause minimal damage to the lung, and the structural alterations which do occur are believed to be due to the stress to which the animals were subjected during the exposure period...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{based on}} 77 K laser excited fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence quenching, fluorescence line narrowing, and spectroscopic-solvent-accessibility evaluation {{is shown to}} be a highly selective and sensitive approach for identification of different types of DNA adducts from benzo (a) pyrene diol epoxides. The fluorescence experiments of using DNA analog-double helix poly(oligo) nucleotide adducts yielded consistent results. Based upon model compounds, two anti-BPDE-DNA adducts have been identified by FLNS, trans N[superscript] 2 -dG and N[superscript] 6 -dA, which are believed to be of greatly biological-significance in the initiation processes of carcinogenesis.;This study shows that FLNS has sufficient resolution to distinguish the DNA adducts formed from the different BPDE stereoisomers, (+) -, (-) -anti-, and syn-BPDE-DNA adducts. FLNS was successfully applied to characterize the DNA adducts in the liver of English sole exposed to different doses of BaP in vivo. FLNS directly detected for the first time detected a potent carcinogen, (+) -anti-BPDE-DNA adduct, in women 2 ̆ 7 s placental samples. Laser-excited fluorescence spectroscopy also revealed several other adducts in the placental DNA samples. The chemical origins of these adducts can be determined arising from three widespread environmental carcinogens: benzo (a) pyrene, benzo (b) fluoranthene, and <b>dibenz</b> (a,h) anthracene. The metabolic activation of BaP in the woman placenta is mainly through the monooxygenation pathway. In addition, this study reveals that the formation of the major adduct resulting from exposure to BaP in humans and fish is closely associated with the interactions of the co-existing carcinogens. The results {{of this study indicate that}} these carcinogens experience the same metabolic pathways in fish and in the human body, which may support the hypothesis that bottom-feeding fish species may serve as early warning indicators of carcinogenic hazards to man...|$|E
40|$|Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{concentrations}} in dust trapped on {{air conditioning unit}} filters operating in residential and workplace locations in Doha, Qatar were sampled and measured. Fourteen samples were collected and their PAH congener profile were quantified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The {{results showed that the}} medians of ΣPAH 16, which include seven carcinogenic components (ΣPAH 7), were 214. 7 ng g− 1 and 129. 2 ng g− 1 of dust respectively for the residential samples, and 224. 4 ng g− 1 and 137. 9 ng g− 1 respectively for dust samples collected in an office workplace environment. Among all samples, benzo (b) fluoranthene (BBF) and benzo (a) pyrene (BAP) were the dominant congeners in both the residential and workplace samples, representing 18. 2 % and 16. 9 % of the ΣPAH 16, respectively. Factors of correlation were calculated for various PAHs, and showed that lighter molecular weight PAHs have a significant positive correlation with heavier congeners within the residential samples, while workplace samples showed a negative correlation with BAP, Indeno (1, 2, 3 -cd) pyrene (IND), and <b>Dibenz</b> (a,h) anthracene (DBA). Benzo (a) pyrene equivalent (BAPe) was used to assess the risk of human exposure to PAH inhalation. BAPe estimates for residences sampled averaged 0. 019 μg g− 1, with a maximum of 0. 063 μg g− 1 of dust, while workplace estimates averaged at 0. 056 μg g− 1 with a maximum of 0. 148 μg g− 1. Source apportionment assessment indicated that most residential and workplace PAHs samples have a pyrogenic origin with few showing evidence of petrogenic origins. All quantified PAHs concentrations and estimated BAPe in Qatar indoor dust samples are well below reported values elsewhere in the world...|$|E
