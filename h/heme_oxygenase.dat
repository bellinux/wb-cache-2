Enzymes required for heme biosynthesis and degradation pathways are evolutionarily conserved. While heme metabolism has been studied extensively, the expression of heme metabolism enzymes during development has not been described. Here, we report that all heme biosynthases and two <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenases,</b> which initiate <b>heme</b> degradation, are dynamically expressed during Xenopus embryonic development. All heme synthases, with the exception of aminolevulinic acid synthase 2, are maternally expressed. At neurula stage, heme synthases are expressed in the developing neural tissue and in migrating neural crest cells. At the swimming tadpole stage, expression of heme synthases can be detected in multiple lineages, including eyes, neural crest cells, developing central nervous system, ventral blood island, pronephron, and pronephric tubule. Similar to <b>heme</b> synthases, <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenases</b> are expressed maternally. Zygotic expression of <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenases</b> is mainly restricted to the developing neural and neural crest lineages. Unlike <b>heme</b> synthases, <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenases</b> are not expressed in the ventral blood island and are expressed at a very low level in the pronephron and pronephric tubule. This indicates that heme metabolism may play important roles during development...|$|R

Heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), the inducible form of HOs, can be upregulated by a variety of harmful stimuli in most cell types [14, 15].

25|$|DNA {{microarray}} {{studies done}} on different fish species exposed to low-oxygen conditions {{have shown that}} at the genetic level fish respond to hypoxia by changing the expression of genes involved in oxygen transport, ATP production, and protein synthesis. In the liver of mudsuckers exposed to hypoxia there were changes in the expression of genes involved in heme metabolism such as hemopexin, <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenase</b> 1, and ferritin. Changes in the sequestration and metabolism of iron may suggest hypoxia induced erythropoiesis and increased demand for hemoglobin synthesis, leading to increased oxygen uptake and transport. Increased expression of myoglobin, which is normally only found in muscle tissue, has also been observed after hypoxia exposure in the gills of zebrafish and in non-muscle tissue of the common carp suggesting increased oxygen transport throughout fish tissues.|$|E

Following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993, as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as anti-inflammatories, vasodilators, and promoters of neovascular growth. Clinical trials of small amounts of carbon monoxide as a drug are ongoing. Too much carbon monoxide causes carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E
500|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} has {{a higher}} diffusion coefficient compared to oxygen and the only enzyme {{in the human body}} that produces carbon monoxide is <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenase</b> which is located in all cells and breaks down heme. Under normal conditions carbon monoxide levels in the plasma are approximately 0 mmHg because it {{has a higher}} diffusion coefficient and the body easily gets rid of any CO made. [...] When CO is not ventilated it binds to hemoglobin, which is the principal oxygen-carrying compound in blood; this produces a compound known as carboxyhemoglobin. The traditional belief is that carbon monoxide toxicity arises from the formation of carboxyhemoglobin, which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and inhibits the transport, delivery, and utilization of oxygen by the body. The affinity between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide is approximately 230 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen so hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen.|$|E

This effect arose due {{to the ability of}} CO to bind to mitochondria (presumably at complex IV of the electron transport chain) and so cause electron leak, which resulted in increased production of reactive oxygen species. These modulated the channel's activity through interactions with three cysteine residues in the cytosolic C-terminus of the channel's major, pore-forming subunit.

To understand better the relationship between this distinct structural characteristic and the functional properties of IsdI, spectroscopic, electrochemical, and crystallographic results are reported that provide evidence that this heme ruffling is essential to the catalytic activity of the protein and eliminates the need for the water cluster in the distal heme pocket that is essential for the activity of classical <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenases.</b> The lack of heme orientational disorder in 1 H-NMR spectra of the protein argues that the catalytic formation of β- and δ-biliverdin in nearly equal yield results from the ability of the protein to attack opposite sides of the heme ring rather than from binding of the heme substrate in two alternative orientations...|$|R
2500|$|The {{biotransformation}} {{of arsenic}} for excretion is primarily done through the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Under normal conditions the Nrf2 {{is bound to}} Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1) in its inactive form. With the uptake of arsenic within cells and the subsequent reactions that result {{in the production of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS), the Nrf2 unbinds and becomes active. Keap1 has reactive thiol moieties that bind ROS or electrophilic arsenic species such as monomethylted arsenic (III) and induces the release of Nrf2 which then travels through the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The Nrf2 then activates antioxidant responsive element (ARE) as well as electrophilic responsive element (EpRE) both of which contribute in the increase of antioxidant proteins. Of particular note in these antioxidant proteins is <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenase</b> 1 (...) , NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and γ-glutamylcysteine synthase (γGCS) which work in conjunction to reduce the oxidative species such as hydrogen peroxide to decrease the oxidative stress upon the cell. The increase in γGCS causes an increased production of aresnite triglutathionine (As(SG)3) an important adduct that is taken up by either multidrug associated protein 1 or 2 (MRP1 or MRP2) which removes the arsenic out of the cell and into bile for excretion. It should be noted that this adduct can also decompose back into inorganic arsenic.|$|E

CO suppresses circadian transcription by attenuating CLOCK– BMAL 1 binding to target promoters. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of CO-producing <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenases</b> abrogates normal daily cycles in mammalian cells and Drosophila.

This ‘next generation’ of HO inhibitors offers a number of desirable characteristics, including isozyme selectivity, negligible effects on HO protein expression, and physicochemical properties favourable for in vivo distribution.

30|$|Heme {{commonly}} {{serves as}} the prosthetic group for hemoproteins, such as hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochromes and nitric oxide synthase. These hemoproteins are involved in oxygen transport, oxidative catalysis and electron transport (Rae and Goff, 1998; Brown et al., 2004; Pamplona et al., 2007; Girvan and Munro, 2013). In addition, heme is important for systemic iron homeostasis in mammals, as it is present in many normal dietary sources (Pamplona et al., 2007). A number of heme transporters (FLVCR, ABCG 2 /BCRP, ABCB 6, ABCB 7 and ABCB 10, PCFT/HCP 1, HRG- 1 and HRG- 4) and heme-binding transcription factors (Bach 1, NPAS 2 and Rev-erb) are reportedly involved in heme metabolism and regulation (Severance and Hamza, 2009; Yang et al., 2008). Many hemes are enzymatically degraded by their degradation systems, such as <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenases</b> (HO, including HO- 1, 2, and 3) and microsomal cytochrome P 450 reductase.

5000|$|The {{chemical}} group that ZnPP belongs to {{is similar to}} free heme which is a natural substrate of <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenase.</b> ZnPP {{is known as a}} competitive inhibitor of <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenase.</b> <b>Heme</b> <b>oxygenase</b> is a cytoprotective enzyme that copes with oxidative stress on a cell and shows higher expression in cancerous tissues. ZnPP suppression of <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenase</b> reduces cell viability of cancer cells and increases cytotoxicity in cancer cells. ZnPP works in combination with anticancer drugs to increase cytotoxicity greatly in some cases; results in one study have shown a five-fold increase in treatment efficacy. ZnPP has been shown to have a major role in inhibiting tumor growth especially solid tumors. Tumors from brain cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell cancer, oral squamous cell cancer, and leukemia all show a susceptibility to ZnPP due to increase expression of <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenase.</b> The inhibition of <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenase</b> leads to an increase of reactive oxidative species in the cell which sensitizes the cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Increased reactive oxidative species can cause apoptosis in cancer cells and reduce drug resistance when exposed to ZnPP due to loss of the <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenase</b> coping mechanism. The combination of these two therapies is highly effective in treating cancer in experiments thus far, and is a possible new method for overcoming drug resistance. The reduced coping ability of tissues treated with ZnPP also increases radiosensitivity. Cells treated with ZnPP and radiation as opposed to simply one of the two are less viable and more likely to stay in G1 phase of the cell cycle, rather than progress to the G2 phase. ZnPP and radiation combination therapy shows more apoptosis than the same amount of radiation displaying that ZnPP puts stress on cancerous tissue. ZnPP have been injected in a number of trials on solid tumors, but can be utilized more broadly when effectively delivered to cancer cells and not healthy cells. A targeted delivery system is need to fully exploit the uses of ZnPP as a therapeutic agent and <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenase</b> inhibitor due to the potential side effects of free ZnPP on healthy tissue.

However ZnPP have been encapsulated in nanoparticles with specialized coating for drug delivery inside the body. ZnPP did not show any reduce inhibitory potential on <b>heme</b> <b>oxygenase</b> when loaded into nanoparticles. Similarly ZnPP loaded into nanoparticles has a higher cytotoxicity than free ZnPP after two days due to a more favorable release rate as well as better biodistribution and internalization. The possible negative effects on major organs were not seen and blood distribution is more desirable in ZnPP loaded nanoparticles than free ZnPP.

The HO system acts as potent antioxidants, protects endothelial cells from apoptosis, is involved in regulating vascular tone, attenuates inflammatory response in the vessel wall, and participates in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Endothelial integrity and activity are thought to occupy the central position in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular disease risk conditions converge in the contribution to oxidative stress. The oxidative stress leads to endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell dysfunction with increases in vessel tone, cell growth, and gene expression that create a pro-thrombotic/pro-inflammatory environment.

In benign endometriosis, autoxidation and Fenton reaction of hemoglobin from the ferrous Fe 2 + (oxyhemoglobin) state to the ferric Fe 3 + (methemoglobin) state lead to production of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as 				O 2 - and OH∙.
