5|$|Antibodies are glycoproteins {{belonging}} to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may {{be attached to the}} antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific <b>Fc</b> <b>Receptor</b> (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, IgE is responsible for an allergic response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release. IgE's Fab paratope binds to allergic antigen, for example house dust mite particles, while its Fc region binds to <b>Fc</b> <b>receptor</b> ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.|$|E
5|$|Those {{cells that}} {{recognize}} coated pathogens have Fc receptors, which, {{as the name}} suggests, interact with the Fc region of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies. The engagement of a particular antibody with the <b>Fc</b> <b>receptor</b> on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will phagocytose, mast cells and neutrophils will degranulate, natural killer cells will release cytokines and cytotoxic molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe. The activation of natural killer cells by antibodies initiates a cytotoxic mechanism known as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) – this process may explain the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies used in biological therapies against cancer. The Fc receptors are isotype-specific, which gives greater flexibility to the immune system, invoking only the appropriate immune mechanisms for distinct pathogens.|$|E
25|$|In the blood, IgA {{interacts with}} an <b>Fc</b> <b>receptor</b> called FcαRI (or CD89), which is {{expressed}} on immune effector cells, to initiate inflammatory reactions. Ligation of FcαRI by IgA containing immune complexes causes antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), degranulation of eosinophils and basophils, phagocytosis by monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, and triggering of respiratory burst activity by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether <b>receptors</b> for IgG (<b>Fc</b> <b>receptors),</b> as identified by different methods, are found on identical human lymphocyte subpopulations, {{and the relationship}} of <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> to surface immunoglobulin (SIg) and receptor for complement (C'). <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> were identified by two rosetting techniques (antibody-sensitized human erythrocytes, HuEA, or sheep erythrocytes, ShEA) and two immunofluorescent techniques (heat-aggregated IgG of human origin, HuAgg, or of guinea-pig origin, GPAgg) ...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{patients}} with {{moderate to severe}} atopic dermatitis had increased levels of IgE in the blood and a reduced level of T cells with <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> for IgG (Tγ). After pronase and trypsin digestion of <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors,</b> cultured T cells regenerated the <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors,</b> but preserved the difference between patients and controls. Neuraminidase treatment increased the Tγ-cell level in both patients and controls. Serum from {{patients with}} atopic dermatitis could not reduce the Tγ-cell expression in the controls. With regard to <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors,</b> no qualitative difference was observed between patients and controls, but a genuine quantitative difference accounts for the observed reduction of Tγ cells in blood...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of whether human peripheral B lymphocytes have <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> was examined directly by double-label immunofluorescent techniques utilizing assays for detection of <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors,</b> surface immunoglobulin, and complement <b>receptors.</b> <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> were detected by indirect immunofluorescence after incubation with soluble antigen-antibody complexes. Complement receptors were detected by the binding of fluoresceinated bacteria coated with complement. It was demonstrated that most surface immunoglobulin-bearing, complement-receptor positive lymphocytes did not bind soluble antigen-antibody complexes. Conversely, most cells which readily bound soluble complexes did not have surface immunoglobulin or complement receptors. Therefore, most peripheral B lymphocytes do not have easily detectable <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> and most <b>Fc</b> receptor-bearing lymphocytes do not have B cell markers...|$|R
25|$|Once the {{generalized}} abnormal immune response has become established which may take {{several years before}} any symptoms occur, plasma cells derived from B lymphocytes produce rheumatoid factors and ACPA of the IgG and IgM classes in large quantities. These activate macrophages through <b>Fc</b> <b>receptor</b> and complement binding, {{which is part of}} the intense inflammation in RA. Binding of an autoreactive antibody to the Fc receptors is mediated through the antibody's N-glycans, which are altered to promote inflammation in people with RA.|$|E
25|$|Antibody-dependent cell-mediated {{cytotoxicity}} (ADCC) requires {{antibodies to}} bind to target cell surfaces. Antibodies are formed of a binding region (Fab) and the Fc region {{that can be}} detected by immune system cells via their Fc surface receptors. Fc receptors are found on many immune system cells, including natural killer cells. When natural killer cells encounter antibody-coated cells, the latter's Fc regions interact with their Fc receptors, releasing perforin and granzyme B to kill the tumor cell. Examples include Rituximab, Ofatumumab and Alemtuzumab. Antibodies under development have altered Fc regions that have higher affinity for {{a specific type of}} <b>Fc</b> <b>receptor,</b> FcγRIIIA, which can dramatically increase effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} stages of allergy, a type I {{hypersensitivity}} reaction against an allergen encountered {{for the first time and}} presented by a professional antigen-presenting cell causes a response in a type of immune cell called a TH2 lymphocyte, which belongs to a subset of T cells that produce a cytokine called interleukin-4 (IL-4). These TH2 cells interact with other lymphocytes called B cells, whose role is production of antibodies. Coupled with signals provided by IL-4, this interaction stimulates the B cell to begin production of a large amount of a particular type of antibody known as IgE. Secreted IgE circulates in the blood and binds to an IgE-specific receptor (a kind of <b>Fc</b> <b>receptor</b> called FcεRI) on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called mast cells and basophils, which are both involved in the acute inflammatory response. The IgE-coated cells, at this stage, are sensitized to the allergen.|$|E
2500|$|IgE primes the IgE-mediated {{allergic}} response by binding to <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> {{found on the}} surface of mast cells and basophils. <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> are also found on eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages and platelets in humans.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} causing {{deposition of}} {{circulating immune complexes}} is largely unknown. The possible role of tissue IgG <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> in immune complex localization has been evaluated using IgG coated ox RBC (ox erythrocyte antisera [EA]) as indicator particles. Cryostat tissue sections of normal human synovium, skin, kidney, choroid plexus, lung and uveal tract were examined {{for the presence of}} IgG <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors,</b> with human spleen used as a positive control. Ox EA were shown to bind to splenic red pulp. This binding could be almost completely blocked by heat aggregated human IgG. In none of the other normal tissues examined were IgG <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> demonstrated. To investigate the possibility that inflamed tissues express <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors,</b> biopsy specimens of rheumatoid synovium and skin demonstrating vasculitis were studied. No ox EA binding to these tissues was noted. We concluded that IgG <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> are probably not present in tissues that are targets for immune complex deposition and are therefore unlikely {{to play a role in}} this process...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of surface immunoglobulin-positive lymph node cells possess <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> detectable by a rosette technique. The movement of surface immunoglobulin to form caps does {{not alter the}} distribution of <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors,</b> although <b>Fc</b> rosette-forming indicator cells collect over the immunoglobulin cap under capping conditions...|$|R
2500|$|The {{effect of}} {{glucocorticoids}} on <b>Fc</b> <b>receptor</b> expression in immune cells is complicated. [...] Dexamethasone decreases IFN-gamma simulated Fc gamma RI expression in neutrophils while conversely causing {{an increase in}} monocytes. Glucocorticoids may also decrease the expression of Fc receptors in macrophages, but the evidence supporting this regulation in earlier studies has been questioned. The effect of <b>Fc</b> <b>receptor</b> expression in macrophages is important since {{it is necessary for}} the phagocytosis of opsonised cells. [...] This is because Fc receptors bind antibodies attached to cells targeted for destruction by macrophages.|$|E
2500|$|Platelet {{activation}} begins {{seconds after}} adhesion occurs. It is triggered [...] when collagen from the subendothelium binds with its receptors on the platelet. GPVI {{is associated with}} the <b>Fc</b> <b>receptor</b> gamma chain and leads via the activation of a tyrosine kinase cascade finally to the activation of PLC-gamma2 PLCG2 and more calcium release.|$|E
5000|$|The {{neonatal}} <b>Fc</b> <b>receptor</b> is an <b>Fc</b> <b>receptor</b> {{which is}} similar in structure to the MHC class I molecule and also associates with beta-2-microglobulin. It was first discovered in rodents as a unique receptor capable of transporting IgG from mother's milk across the epithelium of newborn rodent's gut into the newborn's bloodstream. [...] Further studies revealed a similar receptor in humans, leading to the naming as a neonatal <b>Fc</b> <b>receptor.</b> In humans, however, it {{is found in the}} placenta to help facilitate transport of mother's IgG to the growing fetus and it has also been shown {{to play a role in}} monitoring IgG turnover. Neonatal <b>Fc</b> <b>receptor</b> expression is up-regulated by the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, and down-regulated by IFN-γ.|$|E
40|$|Six {{different}} {{immune complex}} test {{systems for the}} detection of IgG <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> were applied to the study of various human lymphocyte populations. The extent of binding varied widely according to the system and the cell type employed. Two systems bound preferentially to a high proportion of B lymphocytes from peripheral blood or tonsils, one of which bound with only a very few T cells. In contrast, four other test systems which bound well with the <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> on T lymphocytes gave weaker reactions with <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> on B cells. The reactivity of <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> on null or third population lymphocytes was {{similar to that of the}} Fc-positive T cells. Pronase digestion experiments showed a graded selective loss of reactivity with the different Fc reagents. No one system was optimal for all of the lymphocyte populations, although aggregated IgG exhibited the broadest spectrum of reactivity. A pronounced effect of temperature was evident on the binding reactions, and native IgG showed strong binding at 4 degrees C, particularly to the <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> on T cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{characterized}} the cytotoxic capabilities of human T lymphocyte subpopulations against human {{red blood cells}} (HRBC) and autologous lymphoid cells in an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay. T cells bearing <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> for immunoglobulin IgG (TG) were capable of lysis of antibody-coated HRBC and autologous lymphoid cells while T cells with surface <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> for IgM (TM) displayed no ADCC activity TG-cell mediated ADCC could be inhibited by blockage of surface <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> following treatment with aggregated Ig. Null cells and low-affinity E-rosette forming cells were also capable of similar ADCC activity against these targets...|$|R

40|$|Nylon-fibre non-adherent cells {{isolated}} from human peripheral blood, release their <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> for IgG upon culture in vitro in medium containing 0 - 2 % foetal calf serum. The majority of Fc+ nylon-fibre non-adherent cells was reconstituted using supernates from different cell populations of human peripheral blood. The best reconstituting activity was {{detected in the}} supernates from glass-adherent cells, or unfractionated Lymphoprep cells, while those obtained from nylon-fibre non-adherent cells gave variable results sometimes containing no activity at all. It was shown that reconstitution was achieved by the uptake of <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> present in the supernate which inhibited Fc rosette formation. Inhibition was also achieved with supernates from peripheral blood cells of a patient with monocytic leukaemia. Only autologous but not allogeneic cell supernates could reconstitute <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors.</b> This suggests that the reconstitution of <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> on peripheral blood Fc-IgG lymphocytes by monocytic cells is under genetic control...|$|R
40|$|Summary. -Fc-receptor-bearing cells forming EA rosettes with antibody-coated human {{erythrocytes}} (Ripley) {{were studied}} in cell suspensions and in purified preparations of mononuclear cells (MC) from 20 human malignant tumours. The EA rosettes were studied in preparations made by cytocentrifugation and the rosette-forming cells identified by their nonspecific-esterase activity and phagocytic capacity. <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> {{were found on}} 16 + 20 % of all cells in the primary cell suspensions. Significantly more tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes had detectable <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> (33 + 18 %) than did peripheral-blood lymphocytes in cancer patients (19 + 8 %) and normal control subjects (14 + 6 %). There was a significant correlation between the proportion of lymphocytes lacking T and B markers (null cells) {{and the proportion of}} lymphocytes with <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors.</b> <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> were also found on most tumour-infiltrating macrophages, on some T lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells and on a smaller percentage of the tumour cells...|$|R
40|$|Ia (Ir associated) antigens and <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> have {{previously}} {{been shown to}} be associated on the murine B-lymphocyte surface (1). Pretreatment of lymphocytes with anti-Ia antibodies, as well as Fab fragments thereof, specifically inhibited the binding of complexed Ig to B lymphocytes. In contrast, antibodies against the K and D regions of the H- 2 complex did not produce such inhibition. This observation has been confirmed in the mouse (2, 3), and similar observations have been made in both man (4) and the rat (5). One laboratory was unable to demonstrate a specific association (6). Recent experiments (7 - 9) have shown that Ia antigens and <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> on B lymphocytes are probably not identical, but rather appear to be closely associated with each other on the B-lymphocyte membrane. This conclusion is based on the observation that capping of <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> does not appear to alter the distribution or detectability of most Ia antigens (7 - 9) and certain lymphoid cell lines have been identified which bear ~'Ia-like " antigens but not detectable <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> (10). Although more difficult to detect, both <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> (11 - 13) and Ia antigens (14 - 17) appear to be present on at least a subpopulation ofT lymphocytes in both the thymus and spleen of mice. The experiments reported here provide evidence that Ia antigens are also specifically associated with the <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> of some of these T lymphocytes...|$|R

50|$|When IgG molecules, {{specific}} for {{a certain}} antigen or surface component, bind to the pathogen with their Fab region (fragment antigen binding region), their Fc regions point outwards, in direct reach of phagocytes. Phagocytes bind those Fc regions with their <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors.</b> Many low affinity interactions are formed between receptor and antibody that work together to tightly bind the antibody-coated microbe. The low individual affinity prevents <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> from binding antibodies {{in the absence of}} antigen, and therefore reduces the chance of immune cell activation in the absence of infection. This also prevents agglutination (clotting) of phagocytes by antibody when there is no antigen. After a pathogen has been bound, interactions between the Fc region of the antibody and the <b>Fc</b> <b>receptors</b> of the phagocyte results in the initiation of phagocytosis. The pathogen becomes engulfed by the phagocyte by an active process involving the binding and releasing of the <b>Fc</b> region/Fc <b>receptor</b> complex, until the cell membrane of the phagocyte completely encloses the pathogen.|$|R
