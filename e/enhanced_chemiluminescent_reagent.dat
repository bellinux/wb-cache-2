40|$|Summary This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} a method to measure mRNA in small samples of human tissue by the polymerase chain reaction with a nonradioactive label. In this method RNA is reverse-transcribed {{in the presence of a}} control RNA, and subsequently amplified by the polymerase chain reaction during which a nonradioactive label (digoxigenin- 1 1 dUTP) is incorporated. Gel blotting and immunological detection of digoxigenin followed by a chemiluminescent reaction provide an intense signal on film. This allows the detection and quantitation of 3 -hydroxy- 3 methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase mRNA in 12 ng of RNA. We demonstrate that this is a sensitive and reproducible method, and that quantitation is linear with respect to the amount of mRNA present. The application of this method to the measurement of low density lipoprotein receptor and 3 -hydroxy- 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase mRNA levels in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human liver biopsy samples is discussed.

The required instrumentation is limited as no external light source is needed. Also, the technique opens perspectives for increasing detection sensitivity in miniaturized flowing streams. On the other hand, several drawbacks still limit full application, eg dependence of the emission signal upon a number of environmental factors forcing the analyst to make a compromise between separating and measuring conditions, a lack of selectivity in specific cases, the critical detection of the signal at strictly defined periods, especially in the case of sharp emission vs time profiles...|$|R

40|$|Four {{different}} {{serological tests}} for detection of banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) in banana sap are compared: (i) a triple-antibody sandwich ELISA for BBTV, utilising anti-BBTV polyclonal antibodies for virus capture, and anti-BBTV monoclonal antibodies, alkaline phosphatase-labelled sheep anti-mouse antibodies, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate for detection (ELISA-NPP); (ii) an alternative enzyme-substrate system for ELISA involving an amplification step (Ampak(TM) enzyme amplification kit) (ELISA-A); (iii) a colorimetric dot immunobinding assay (DIBA-C), {{in which the}} enzyme-substrate system was alkaline phosphatase and nitroblue tetrazolium/ 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl-phosphate; (iv) an <b>enhanced</b> <b>chemiluminescent</b> form (DIBA-ECL), in which the enzyme-substrate system was horseradish peroxidase and luminol. For both DIBA-C and DIBA-ECL, maximum sensitivity was obtained by pre-coating the nitrocellulose membrane with anti-BBTV polyclonal antibodies, by using 0. 05 M sodium carbonate (pH 9. 6) as the coating buffer, and by clarifying the sap by centrifugation and extraction with chloroform or dichloromethane. Treatment of the sap before centrifugation by snap-freezing at - 70 degrees C, or heating at either 30 or 50 degrees C for 10 min, {{had no effect on}} sensitivity; heating at 70 degrees C for 10 min eliminated antigenicity. ELISA-NPP, ELISA-A, and DIBA-ECL had equivalent sensitivity, but DIBA-C was up to 8 -fold less sensitive than the former 3 assays. ELISA-NPP was adjudged to be the best compromise between sensitivity, cost and completion time...|$|R
40|$|A {{chemiluminescence}} (CL) {{detection method}} for {{the determination of}} sulfite using the reaction of Ru(bipy) 32 + (bipy = 2, 2 A-bipyridyl) –SO 322 –KBrO 3 is described. The concentration of sulfite {{is proportional to the}} CL intensity in the range 2. 5 3 1028 – 9. 5 3 1025 mol l 21. The limit of detection is 3. 8 3 1029 mol l 21 and the relative standard deviation is 4. 6 % for 5 3 1025 mol l 21 sulfite solution with nine repeated measurements. This method was successfully applied to the determination of sulfite in sugar and sulfur dioxide in air by using triethanolamine as the absorbent material. The determinations of sulfite and sulfur dioxide are very important because of their use as food preservatives to prevent oxidation and bacterial growth and a reducing agent in bleaching, they also show potential toxicity as pollutants in the atmosphere. Many methods are available for their determina-tion, such as spectrophotometry, 1, 2 potentiometry, 3, 4 coulo-metry, 5 gas chromatography–chemiluminescence (CL), 6 HPLC–fluorescence detection 7 and ion chromatography. 8 How-ever, each has some drawbacks, such as lack of sensitivity, selectivity or simplicity. CL has been used for the determination of sulfite because of its high sensitivity and simplicity. The CL was produced by sulfite as follows: sulfite can be oxidized by copper(ii) 9 in an alkaline solution, and reacts with the <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>reagent</b> luminol. 10 In an acidic solution it can be oxidized by potassium permanganate 11 or cerium(iv). 12 The light-emission intensity can be enhanced by the presence of some compounds, e. g., riboflavin for reaction with permanga-nate 13, 14 and cerium(iv), 15 flavin mononucleotide for reaction with permanganate 16 and 3 -cyclohexylaminopropanesulfonic acid (CAPS) for reaction with permanganate 14, 17 and cer-ium(iv), 18 steroids for reaction with potassium bromate 19 and sodium cyclamate for reaction with cerium(iv). 20 The kinetics and mechanism of sulfite oxidation were as follows: 9, 2...|$|R
40|$|The low {{affinity}} IgE receptor Fc epsilon RII (CD 23) {{is important}} in several aspects of T and B cell function. In this study serum levels of soluble CD 23 (sCD 23) were measured in three groups: 26 female patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 21 females with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and 25 normal healthy females. The concentration of sCD 23 was determined using an <b>enhanced</b> <b>chemiluminescent</b> sandwich ELISA developed in this laboratory. Increased levels of sCD 23 were observed in pSS and in SLE patients compared with controls (median 23. 0 versus 8. 6, P less than 0. 0002 and 18. 1 versus 8. 6, P less than 0. 002 respectively). While the median level of sCD 23 {{was found to be}} higher in pSS than in SLE the difference was not statistically significant. Patients with SLE and pSS on glucocorticoid treatment had significantly lower levels of sCD 23 than patients not on this treatment (median 28. 9 versus 14. 4, P less than 0. 05). Amongst the control patients sCD 23 was inexplicably lower in the female members relative to the males (median 8. 5 versus 12. 3, P less than 0. 05). Although serum IgG and IgA levels were significantly elevated in pSS and SLE patients relative to controls there was no direct correlation between sCD 23 and the serum levels of these immunoglobulins. We conclude that B cell hyperactivity which occurs in both pSS and SLE is associated with raised levels of sCD 23...|$|R
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{is divided into two}} parts; the first is the {{synthesis}} of a ‘switch-on’ fluorophore to measure cell viability, and the second is the development of a fluorescent detection method for protein−peptide affinity assays applied in the identification of protein-protein inhibitors. Tetrazolium salts are often used in cytotoxicity assays as indicators of cell viability as they are reduced to deeply coloured formazans exclusively in healthy cells. However, measuring the absorbance of the formazan is prone to bias from other coloured species in the cell media, requires solubilisation and can be difficult to quantify. A preferable method of detection is direct fluorescence as it is easily quantified, more sensitive and would ideally remove the need to solubilise the insoluble dye. The aim of this project was to synthesise a tetrazolium salt that could be reduced to a soluble fluorescent formazan in healthy cells as an indicator of cell viability. A number of fluorescent formazans were synthesised by incorporation of a fluorophore. The corresponding tetrazolium salts were non-fluorescent and could be reduced to the formazan in vitro. Several formazans were synthesised to attempt to increase the emission wavelength and intensity to overcome cellular autofluorescence. Protein-protein interactions have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases but until recently were considered undruggable. However, peptides have emerged as ideal compounds for targeting the large and relatively featureless protein interfaces. Work focussed on the discovery of peptide inhibitors for the E 3 ubiquitin ligase stationary-phase kinase associated protein (Skp 2). Potential peptide inhibitors were identified using CelluSpot synthesis and array technology to screen peptide libraries. Qualitative analysis of the protein affinity assay results by <b>enhanced</b> <b>chemiluminescent</b> detection was found to be misleading, and so a quantifiable and more sensitive fluorescent detection method was developed...|$|R
