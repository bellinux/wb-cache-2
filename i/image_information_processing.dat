40|$|OVERVIEW: As the {{functionality}} of AV equipment improves and {{the number}} of TV broadcast channels increases, the era in which we “can’t pick and can’t watch ” our preferred programs is approaching. In addressing this problem, Hitachi has developed an “intelligent user interface”—which uses “multimodal dialog control ” to help users (i. e. viewers) operate home AV equipment by means of spoken dialog. Integrating speech information processing, <b>image</b> <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> and a TV program recommender based on viewing-history analysis, this multimodal dialog control can partake in dialog with the viewer. Without the need for keyword entry, the TV program recommender automatically analyzes the viewer’s program preferences from their past viewing history, and then selects, recommends, and records certain programs according to the analysis results. Utilizing voice information processing, this intelligent user interface can operate AV devices via spoken dialog very close to everyday conversation. It can also distinguish different viewers by facial image recognition and automatically change the offered services (such as the TV program recommender) to match the preferences of whoever is in front of the TV...|$|E
40|$|We posit a new {{paradigm}} for <b>image</b> <b>information</b> <b>processing.</b> For the last 25 years, this task was usually approached {{in the frame of}} Treisman's two-stage paradigm [1]. The latter supposes an unsupervised, bottom-up directed process of preliminary information pieces gathering at the lower processing stages and a supervised, top-down directed process of information pieces binding and grouping at the higher stages. It is acknowledged that these sub-processes interact and intervene between them in a tricky and a complicated manner. Notwithstanding the prevalence of this paradigm in biological and computer vision, we nevertheless propose to replace it with a new one, which we would like to designate as a two-part paradigm. In it, information contained in an image is initially extracted in an independent top-down manner by one part of the system, and then it is examined and interpreted by another, separate system part. We argue that the {{new paradigm}} seems to be more plausible than its forerunner. We provide evidence from human attention vision studies and insights of Kolmogorov's complexity theory to support our arguments. We also provide some reasons in favor of separate image interpretation issues.

40|$|Understanding {{the meaning}} behind visual data is {{increasingly}} {{important as the}} quantity of digital images in circulation explodes, and as computing {{in general and the}} Internet in specific shifts quickly towards an increasingly visual presentation of data. However, the remarkable amount of variance inside categories (e. g. different kinds of chairs) combined with the occurrence of similarity between categories (e. g. similar breeds of cats and dogs) makes this problem incredibly difficult to solve. In particular, the semantic segmentation of images into contiguous regions of similar interpretation combines the difficulties of object recognition and image segmentation to result in a problem of great complexity, yet great reward. This thesis proposes a novel {{solution to the problem of}} semantic segmentation, and explores its application to image search and retrieval.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an efficient approach for human face recognition based on blood perfusion data from infra-red face images. Blood perfusion data {{are characterized by}} the regional blood flow in human tissue and therefore do not depend entirely on surrounding temperature. These data bear a great potential for deriving discriminating facial thermogram for better classification and recognition of face images in comparison to optical image data. Blood perfusion data are related to distribution of blood vessels under the face skin. A distribution of blood vessels are unique for each person and {{as a set of}} extracted minutiae points from a blood perfusion data of a human face should be unique for that face. There may be several such minutiae point sets for a single face but all of these correspond to that particular face only. Entire face image is partitioned into equal blocks and the total number of minutiae points from each block is computed to construct final vector. Therefore, the size of the feature vectors is found to be same as total number of blocks considered. For classification, a five layer feed-forward backpropagation neural network has been used. A number of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed face recognition system with varying block sizes. Experiments have been performed on the database created at our own laboratory. The maximum success of 91. 47 % recognition has been achieved with block size 8 X 8.

Future’s visual surveillance systems for outdoor (including security) applications will require mission platforms that are autonomous, asynchronous, adaptive and highly sensitive in complex, time-varying and possibly hostile environments. One fundamental problem in autonomous surveillance systems is how to detect multiple targets, sense and percept the world/environment in extreme outdoor conditions in which the presence of dust, fog, rain, changing illumination can dramatically degrade conventional stereo and laser sensing. Thus, radar-based imaging in autonomous surveillance systems has attracted extensive research attention in recent years since radar also allows for multiple targets detection within a single beam, whereas other range sensors are limited to one target return per emission. The main challenge arising from radar-based autonomous visual surveillance systems is always linked to radar <b>image</b> <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> and utilization, i. e., how to quickly and efficiently extract and analyse the information of interest for multiple targets from consecutive images acquired by radar imaging sensors. In this talk, a visual attention model-based algorithm is proposed to detect multiple targets from SAR (synthetic aperture radar) images. The algorithm extends the well-known Itti model according to the requirements of multiple target detection in SAR images. It locates salient regions in SAR images and reduces false alarms significantly by using an efficient top-down process. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by using real SAR images with 20 vehicle targets.

In this talk, we firstly present a novel neurobiologically-inspired approach to road extraction from radar images. The proposed approach is based on the neurobiological mechanism in which simple cells in primary visual cortex are believed to extract local contour information from a visual scene. The CORF (Combination of Receptive Fields) computational model is used in the proposed approach to road extraction from radar images. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the numerical experimental results obtained from using several SAR(synthetic aperture radar) images are provided. Secondly, a visual attention model-based algorithm is proposed to detect vehicles from SAR (synthetic aperture radar) images. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by using real SAR images with 20 vehicle targets. Finally, an algorithm based on kernel fisher discriminant analysis (KFDA) for vehicle detection and recognition in SAR images is presented. We obtain image samples with a dual-window approach and extract features of the inner and outer window samples using KFDA. An improved KFDA-IMED (Image Euclidean Distance) strategy is employed to obtain the projection in known sample space and combine with a support vector machine (SVM) to recognize vehicles effectively. The performance of this new method is validated with the MSTAR (moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition) database.
