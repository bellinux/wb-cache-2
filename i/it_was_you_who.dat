He had persuaded Darius to let him travel to Ionia by promising to make the Ionians end their revolt. However, Herodotus leaves us in no doubt that his real aim was simply to escape his quasi-captivity in Persia. When he arrived in Sardis, Artaphernes directly accused him of fomenting the rebellion with Aristagoras: [...] "I will tell you, Histiaeus, {{the truth of this}} business: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> stitched this shoe, and Aristagoras who put it on." [...] Histiaeus fled that night to Chios and eventually made his way back to Miletus. However, having just got rid of one tyrant, the Milesians were in no mood to receive Histiaeus back. He therefore went to Mytilene in Lesbos and persuaded the Lesbians to give him eight triremes. He set sail for Byzantium with all those who would follow him. There he established himself, seizing all ships that attempted to sail through the Bosporus, unless they agreed to serve him.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for [...] "Volcano" [...] {{are written}} from the {{perspective}} of a younger Bono addressing his modern-day self; he said, [...] "It's this young guy going, 'The fuck happened to you?'" [...] The Edge composed the song's bass intro. [...] "Raised by Wolves" [...] is about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, which killed 33 people but were narrowly avoided by Bono that day. The song is written {{from the perspective}} of Andy Rowen (brother of Bono's childhood friend Guggi), whose presence at the bombings would later drive him into heroin addiction, a subject also addressed in U2's 1984 song [...] "Bad". [...] "Cedarwood Road" [...] reminisces about the street in Dublin on which Bono lived during his youth. The cherry blossom tree referenced in the lyrics was from the Rowen family garden. [...] "Sleep Like a Baby Tonight", written about a pedophile priest, was described by Qs Tom Doyle as featuring [...] "deceptively lullaby-like... synth pulses" [...] reminiscent of Kraftwerk. Their album The Man-Machine was gifted by Bono to Ali when they were dating as teenagers and is name-checked in [...] "Iris (Hold Me Close)" [...] in the line, [...] "But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> made me your man/Machine". [...] "This Is Where You Can Reach Me Now" [...] takes musical cues from one of the group's childhood inspirations, the Clash. According to the liner notes, the song is dedicated to the Clash's guitarist/vocalist Joe Strummer. The closing track, [...] "The Troubles", was described by Bono as [...] "an uncomfortable song about domestic violence".|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} written to his sister Josephine, however, Pasternak {{recalled}} the words of his friend Ekaterina Krashennikova upon reading Doctor Zhivago. She had said, [...] "Don't forget yourself {{to the point of}} believing that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> wrote this work. It was the Russian people and their sufferings who created it. Thank God for having expressed it through your pen." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Theodoret, {{when the}} emperor tried {{to enter a}} Milanese church, where Ambrose was about to {{celebrate}} a mass, the bishop stopped him and rebuked {{him for what he}} had done. And because the emperor “had been brought up according to divine words and understood well that some affairs are handled by priests, others by emperors”, he could do nothing but return [...] "weeping and sighing" [...] to the palace. Eight months had passed and Theodosius still sat in the palace, moaning and sobbing. His magister officiorum Rufinus, who [...] "used great freedom of speech due to the familiarity with the emperor", noticed this behaviour, approached and asked him why he was weeping. Having been told, he volunteered to see the bishop and ask him to reconsider. Theodosius hesitantly agreed and even chose to follow Rufinus from a distance. Ambrose was not restrained at all when negotiating with Rufinus, scolding him and even accusing him of complicity in the massacre: [...] "Rufinus, you are as impudent as a dog, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> advised the emperor such a bloodshed." [...] When the emperor showed up, Ambrose at first remained stubborn and changed his mind only after Theodosius promised to promulgate a law, which in cases of death sentences would introduce a thirty-day lag before the execution.|$|E
2500|$|... "You {{have heard}} the order, and I must confess are in a pretty {{condition}} to obey it. I will have to return it with the endorsement upon the back that 'the First Maryland refuses to meet the enemy', despite being given orders by General Jackson. Before this day I was proud to call myself a Marylander, but now, God knows, I would rather be known as anything else. Shame on you to bring this stigma upon the fair name of your native state - to cause the finger of scorn to be pointed at those who confided to your keeping their most sacred trust - their honor {{and that of the}} glorious Old State. Marylanders you call yourselves - profane not that hallowed name again, for it is not yours. What Marylander ever before threw down his arms and deserted his colors {{in the presence of the}} enemy, and those arms, and those colors too, placed in your hands by a woman? Never before has one single blot defaced her honored history. Could it be possible to conceive a crime more atrocious, an outrage more damnable? Go home and publish to the world your infamy. Boast of it when you meet your fathers and mothers, brothers, sisters and sweethearts. Tell them <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>you</b> <b>who,</b> when brought face to face with the enemy, proved yourselves recreants, and acknowledged yourselves to be cowards. Tell them this, and see if you are not spurned from their presence like some loathsome leper, and despised, detested, nay abhorred, by those whose confidence you have so shamefully betrayed; you will wander over the face of the earth with the brand of 'coward', 'traitor', indelibly imprinted on your foreheards, and in the end sink into a dishonored grave, unwept for, uncared for, leaving behind as a heritage to your posterity the scorn and contempt of every honest man and virtuous woman in the land." ...|$|E
