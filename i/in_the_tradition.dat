5|$|In {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, Scotland's rapidly {{expanding}} economy and population resulted in the laying out of numerous new towns and remodelled settlements, resulting in a need for new churches to support the local residents.

The builder, Alexander Stevens, probably also designed the steeple of St Cuthbert's Church (1789–90). At Fochabers, from 1776 John Baxter redesigned the village on a grid plan, with a central square focused on Bellie Church (1795–97), still following <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> of Gibbs, with a tetrastyle portico and steeple.|$|E
