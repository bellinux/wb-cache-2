2500|$|From 1936 to 1941, Dyson was a Scholar at Winchester College, {{where his}} father was Director of Music. On 25 July 1943, he entered the Operational Research Section (ORS) of the Royal Air Force’s Bomber Command, [...] where he {{developed}} analytical methods to help the Royal Air Force bomb German targets during the Second World War. After the war, Dyson was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a BA degree in mathematics. [...] From 1946 to 1949, he was a Fellow of his college, occupying rooms just below those of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, who resigned his professorship in 1947. In 1947, he published two papers in number theory. Friends and colleagues describe Dyson as shy and self-effacing, with a contrarian streak that his friends find refreshing but his intellectual opponents find exasperating. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> when consensus is forming like ice hardening on a lake, Dyson will do his best to chip at the ice", Steven Weinberg said of him.

5000|$|The introduction, [...] "Everlasting Dream", is an {{instrumental}} piece. Composer CMJK {{said he was}} inspired by a phrase he used in creating the song, which was “No rain, no rainbow … If it doesn't rain (heartache), you won't see a rainbow (beauty and happiness).” Lyrics were written for the song, but were removed in the final piece. [...] "We Wish" [...] is an uptempo pop rock song. [...] "We Wish" [...] was the original title for the album, but Hamasaki felt that it didn't work well. The third track [...] "Real Me", which is the first song to feature English-language phrases, is an string-based R&B song that was compared to the work of American recording artist Aaliyah. The lyrics to [...] "Real Me" [...] deal with feminism and female empowerment. [...] "Free & Easy" [...] incorporates instrumentations of horns and flutes, utilizing a soft and “airy” sound. [...] "Heartplace" [...] is an electronic rock song. The original version was straightforward hard rock sounds, but when Hamasaki added English lyrics, she felt it needed to be re-composed.

After the “magical” instrumental [...] "Taskinillusion", the ninth track [...] "Everywhere Nowhere" [...] is inspired by uptempo 80s-inspired dance-rock music. The lyrical content deals with social activity. The tenth track [...] "July 1st" [...] is a “summery” dance-pop song.

Today consumers act more pro-environmentally, {{as in the past}} decades they have changed their behaviour. We all recognise that the development of different types of media, especially the Internet and social media, has generated a different approach from societies and traders towards the individual consumer. In this research, we have established that the Internet, social media and TV have at the moment the largest influence on consumers’ environmental behaviour, {{due to the fact that}} {{companies and}} marketers are targeting at the same time different target groups of consumers.

In order to open these areas of life as fields of experience in the first person, we must see them as areas where a work of self constitution is required. Foucault’s lesson in his last courses is crucial in order to equip us with the instruments to visualize the work needed and to acknowledge the state of the present condition, torn between the traditional religious framework and the privileged access to life granted to scientific technology, which both contribute to remove from view the social possibilities of self constitution. ...|$|E
40|$|The process-dissociation {{procedure}} {{was used to}} investigate conscious and unconscious influences of memory for object location. In two experiments, subjects worked with drawings of household objects and rooms of a house depicted on a computer monitor to simulate placing objects in various locations. Memory for object locations was tested by having subjects search for those objects. A double dissociation was obtained between estimates of conscious and unconscious influences of memory computed from equations that assumed independence between these two influences: Age-related {{differences were found in}} the estimate of conscious influences, but not in the estimate of unconscious influences, whereas manipulation of habit strength affected the unconscious estimate, but not the conscious estimate. These results were closely fit by a multinomial model assuming independence between conscious and unconscious influences of memory. When we search for an object that we earlier placed in a particular location, our efforts are influenced by some form or forms of memory that include representations of the various episodes involving our interactions with that object.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} two sociotechnical {{systems that}} are centered around two very different kinds of technological artifacts: bridges and disposable diapers. I use these examples to explore a topic {{which has been a}} long-standing interest of mine, which is how to reconcile a social constructivist view of technological innovation with ideas about technological determinism. Partisans of both these perspectives often paint them as mutually exclusive, but I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> this is really not the case. This has in part been influenced by my experience as a sociologist, working with engineers and designers who seem to experience technology more in terms of the constraints it imposes than as an infinitely flexible creative medium. I think the comparison I present here is very suggestive about some of the constraints that may frequently limit the direction of technological change. I should say, at this point, I don’t regard what I’m about to say as an airtight argument, but rather a somewhat provisional attempt to work through some of the ideas this comparison brings up – so I welcome any input.

40|$|In Istria, between 1870 and 1914, the Croatian {{movement}} {{worked closely}} with the Slovenian national movement creating a political power opposing Italian culture, which resulted in a provisional truce and after this an inconclusive coup in fundamental requests such as the right to the equal usage of Croatian and Slovenian languages in public offices which actually did nothing to improve relationships between these two opposing sides. In 1914 Istria seemed nationally divided between the Croatian-Slovenian block and Italians regardless of the presence of social/social-democratic parties and Christian-social parties and numerous legitimists of the Emperor. Political rivalry till 1914, within the communities, the local Diet and elections for the Viennese Parliament, showed that the Croatian nation in Istria had existed and had asserted itself.

40|$|When two {{scenes are}} {{alternately}} displayed, {{separated by a}} mask, even large, repeated changes between the scenes often go unnoticed for surprisingly long durations. Change blindness of this sort is attenuated at “centres of interest ” in the scenes, however, supporting a theory of change blindness in which attention is necessary to perceive such changes (Rensink, O’Regan, & Clark, 1997). Prob-lems with this measure of attentional selection—via verbally described “centres of interest”—are discussed, including worries about describability and explana-tory impotence. Other forms of attentional selection, not subject to these prob-lems, are employed in a “flicker ” experiment to test the attention-based theory of change detection. Attenuated change blindness is observed at attended items when attentional selection is realized via involuntary exogenous capture of visual attention—to late-onset items and colour singletons—even when these manipulations are uncorrelated with the loci of the changes, and are thus irrele-vant to the change detection task. These demonstrations ground the atten-tion-based theory of change blindness in a type of attentional selection which is understood more rigorously than are “centres of interest”. At the same time, these results have important implications concerning the nature of exogenous attentional capture. It often seems, {{from the perspective of}} vision science, that our perceptual sys-tems work too well. They provide us with extremely strong intuitions about how perception works—about how and when we represent visual scenes—which often turn out to be misleading.
