An improvement {{in the understanding of}} ship behaviour after damage will increase chances of recovery of the vessel and safety for the ship crew and cargo, with corresponding benefits to the maritime environment. Whilst {{a number of studies have}} investigated static behaviour of damaged ships with permeability previous research at forward speed considers the <b>damaged</b> <b>compartment</b> to be empty. Novel aspects of this research include the study of a variety of permeabilities and internal arrangements of the <b>damaged</b> <b>compartment</b> for a ship moving in waves. Results from experiments carried out in a towing tank using a segmented ship model show that permeability appears to have a large effect on the pitch and heave motion responses when the vessel is travelling at forward speed, with reduced effect for a stationary ship. Furthermore, results indicate that internal arrangement of compartments has less effect than compartment permeability on the damaged ship responses. Finally, the influence of damaged orifice size on the motion responses is investigated and the results show that at forward speed the responses are significantly affected and that they are largest for the minimum orifice size tested<br/...|$|E

40|$|When {{a vessel}} is damaged, {{seawater}} floods into the damaged compartments and subsequently influences {{the motion of}} the vessel. Furthermore, the vessel’s behaviour affects the floodwater motion. In this paper, a Navier–Stokes (NS) solver with a free surface capturing technique, i. e., the volume of fluid (VOF) method, was developed to numerically simulate water flooding into a damaged vessel. To verify the developed solver, a 2 -Danda 3 D dam break problems were tested. The numerical results coincide well with the experimental results and with the published numerical results. Additionally, it was used to solve the problems of linear and non-linear liquid sloshing in a hexahedral tank.

40|$|The {{processes}} of marine salvage require firstly the uprighting of the capsized ship, essentially bringing the deck to point up. Analysis and computation are the keys {{for the success}} {{in the application of}} the design schemes. Up to date, there are few researches on calculation methods for uprighting process of capsized ships at China and abroad. Researches about the effect of flooding quantity and the variation of the longitudinal strength during the uprighting process of capsized and damaged ships are even rarer. In this paper, hydromechanical equations to describe the effect of flooding are established and a calculation method for the longitudinal strength is introduced with reference to the hydrostatic theory for ships. Three typical uprighting processes are summarized according to the methods of treatment of <b>damaged</b> <b>compartment.</b> The stability of the inverted ship is calculated and analyzed using the General Hydrostatics software(GHS).

40|$|The {{survivability}} of damaged {{ro-ro vessels}} is investigated by motion simulations in irregular seaways. The simulation combines nonlinear equations for roll and surge motions with a linear treatment of heave, pitch, sway, and yaw, using the strip method. The rate of inflow and outflow of water through the damage openings is estimated form {{the motions of}} the internal and the external water surface relative to the openings, so that the volume of water in each <b>damaged</b> <b>compartment</b> and on the vehicle deck is corrected at each time step. Special {{emphasis was placed on}} simulating realistically the motion of water on deck. For three ships, and with different subdivisions on the ro-ro deck, damage positions, trims and drafts, the limit between safe and unsafe damaged metacentric heights is determined by performing the simulation with different KG values. The simulation method was comprehensively validated by comparison with model tests. A series of parameter investigations was carried out, including damaged freeboard, damage location, vehicle deck subdivisions, sheer of vehicle deck, down-flooding, transient flooding, encounter angle of seaway and speed of ship, with the view to identifying the more significant parameters influencing the survivability of a damaged ro-ro ship.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{research on}} damage stability and unsinkability. The result {{of it is}} a valuable source of knowledge of behaving a ship while flooding its compartments. In the paper, a short description of accidents and damages of Polish warships taking place in 1985 - 2004 is presented. The time when compartments are flooded (tf) and stability parameters are one of the key elements which have influence on a rescue action. The knowledge of the time mentioned and a metacentric height (GM) are very important for a commanding officer making decisions while damage of the ship. To provide the information about the time tf a new method was designed. Firstly, volume of <b>damaged</b> <b>compartments</b> was calculated. To estimate a real quantity of the water, the permeability of flooding compartment ȝ is used. Permeability of the main engine and auxiliary power plant was estimated on the basis of preliminary research presented in the paper. Its value, shown in the article, is dependent on the water level inside compartments. The metacentric height (GM), while flooding process of <b>damage</b> <b>compartments,</b> was calculated in the next step. On the basic of the built computer program, a simulation of the flooding process and value of metacentric height (GM) of the damaged main engine and auxiliary power plant ship’s type 888 was shown. The developed method was tested experimentally and results of the tests are presented in the paper. The results of the experiments can be a base to define general rules to make proper decisions during the process of damage control...|$|R

Instead of using counter-flooding to minimise the list, her crew attempted to correct the list by using coal and oil from the starboard bunkers first. The list caused the generators supplying power to the main battery turrets to flood, hampering the gun crews, particularly as shells were transferred from the magazines to the turrets. The blast from the torpedo was so powerful that forty watertight <b>compartments</b> were <b>damaged,</b> though the torpedo bulkhead localised most of the damage and the more badly <b>damaged</b> <b>compartments</b> were sufficiently shored up.

40|$|In the European project ""Surfacing System for Ship Recovery"" (SuSy), gas {{inflated}} balloons are envisaged to be {{used for}} providing reserve buoyancy to damaged ships for the purpose of preventing ship capsizing and/or sinking, along with lifting wreckages from the seabed. The external application of a SuSy device on an Aframax Tanker that has been structurally compromised is studied, using the finite element method and following the IACS CSR rules for Tankers. A damage condition is assessed, where the middle compartment is compromised on the starboard side and the Tanker is heeling. The damage condition is simulated using a three compartment finite element model along with a simulated damage on the middle compartment. The residual hull girder strength is evaluated and compared to the undamaged case. Subsequently reserve buoyancy is introduced on the damaged side of the Tanker, in terms of attached balloons on the outer hull of the vessel, for the purpose of bringing the ship to an upright position. The effect of the forces exerted from the attached balloons on the vessel is studied, considering global ship strength. The global ship strength is evaluated considering the most suitable areas for attaching the balloons aimed at lowering the stress peaks that appear on the <b>damaged</b> <b>compartment</b> of the vessel. © 2011 : The Royal Institution of Naval Architects...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: At the {{beginning}} of this century, unprecedented interest in the concept of using less invasive approaches for the treatment of knee degenerative diseases was ignited. Initial interest in this approach was about navigated and non-navigated knee reconstruction using small implants and conventional total knee arthroplasty. Methods: To this end, a review of the published literature relating to less invasive compartmental arthroplasty of the knee using computer-based alignment techniques and on soft tissue-dedicated small implants is presented. The authors present and compare their personal results using these techniques with those reported in the current literature. These involved the use of a shorter incision and an emphasis sparing. However, nowadays most surgeons look at compartmental knee resurfacing with the use of small implants as the new customized approach for younger and higher-demand patients. The aim {{of this paper is to}} stimulate further debate. Results: Since {{the beginning}} of 2000, computer-assisted surgery has been applied to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and later to compartmental knee arthroplasty. Recent studies in the literature have reported better implant survivorship for younger patients using navigation in TKA at longer-term follow-up. Only one published report was identified showing superior clinical outcomes at short-term follow-up using computer-assisted technology compared with conventional alignment techniques in small implant surgery. No studies were found in the literature that demonstrated similar clinical advantages with navigated small implants at long-term follow-up. Two published meta-analyses were identified reporting better implant and limb alignment and no increase in complications using a navigated unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. However, neither meta-analysis showed superior clinical outcomes or survivorship with the navigated techniques. Conclusion: In conclusion, we can assert that replacing just the <b>damaged</b> <b>compartment</b> and preserving the normal biomechanics will require not only new implant designs but also new technologies allowing the surgeon to make extremely precise adjustments to implant alignment and providing continuous feedback during surgery.

30|$|The damage {{observed}} to wall, ceiling and content surfaces is {{an artifact of}} the fire dynamics for that fire. Identifying {{the cause of the}} damage is {{complicated by the fact that}} the investigator has to use evidence after the event, such as the location and magnitude of <b>damage,</b> <b>compartment</b> geometry, ventilation openings and the position and number of fuels as a means to identify the range of initial conditions that may have influenced how the fire developed. Because of this, the problem of using fire damage to determine how the fire developed is considered an inverse problem. Other areas of science regularly deal with inverse problems typically through extensive mathematical study. However, most inverse problems are approached by first establishing direct solutions for well-posed problems. Therefore, the approach of this step is to leverage what science currently exists to assist with validating the current list of direct solutions for fire pattern generation and identifying characteristics that may exist and how they may vary with the changing fire dynamics. The direct solutions currently listed for causes of fire patterns include, plume-generated patterns, hot gas layer-generated patterns, ventilation-generated patterns and suppression-generated patterns (NFPA 2014).|$|R

She reached Bremerton, Washington, on December 22 for full repairs, completed on February 20, 1944. The error in judgment concerning opening fire at night was never repeated, as thereafter gun crews were ordered to open fire anytime the ship came under attack. Following this attack, the ship was reported as sunk by Japan's Tokyo Rose, the first of several such assertions.|$|R

Later a finite element model considering the initial design was built in Patran software and refined in LS-DYNA software to simulate ship collision. Collision simulations were conducted by using LS-DYNA in order to investigate the structural response of the pylon.
