40|$|The article’s aim is {{to conduct}} a {{comparative}} cross-section analysis of the innovative behaviour of the German manufacturing industry. The peculiarities of the food industry are tested in a combined analysis based on both <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> Linear and logistic regressions are used to investigate {{the differences between the}} food industry and other branches of the manufacturing industry. In comparison to other branches, the food industry has lower research & development (R&D) expenditures whereas the import of research from more technology intensive sectors is high. Most of the released new products are improvements and imitations. Market novelties are rare. The development time for new products is relatively short compared to other industries, on average 8. 5 months. A major part of innovations are imitated rapidly by competing firms, therefore the first mover advantages are low. Due to the low newness of innovations, marketing activities (e. g. advertising, labelling) are more important for new product introductions than in other industries. The regression analysis for the input indicators measured by the innovation intensity shows that the innovative behaviour of food companies significantly deviates from other manufacturing sectors. However, the logistic regression analysis of the <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> doesn’t confirm these results. The dummy variable of the food companies has no significant impact on the <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> Firms in the food industry might embark on imitation and product modification strategies. Therefore, they realize an average innovation output without spending {{the same amount of money}} as the other industries. In addition, it can be confirmed that small enterprises of the German manufacturing industry have a higher innovation activity in terms of both innovation <b>input</b> and <b>output.</b> The impact of business expectations on <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> is significantly positive. An international orientation measured by the ratio of exports to firm sales leads to a higher probability of introducing new products and novelties.

40|$|Patent {{citation}} analysis {{is considered a}} useful tool for identifying emerging technologies. However, the outcomes of previous methods are likely to reveal no more than current key technologies, since they can only be performed at later stages of technology development due to the time required for patents to be cited (or fail to be cited). This study proposes a machine learning approach to identifying emerging technologies at early stages using multiple patent indicators that can be defined immediately after the relevant patents are issued. For this, first, a total of 18 <b>input</b> and 3 <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> are extracted from the United States Patent and Trademark Office database. Second, a feed-forward multilayer neural network is employed to capture the complex nonlinear relationships between <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> in a time period of interest.

In this paper, the performance of the Swedish national innovation system is analyzed using exactly the same data as those employed by the Innovation Union Scoreboard for the years 2014 and 2015. We argue that the Summary Innovation Index provided by the Innovation UnionScoreboard is highly misleading. Instead of merely calculating this Summary Innovation Index, the individual indicators that constitute this composite innovation indicator need to be analyzed in much greater depth in order to reach a correct measure of the performance of innovation systems.

40|$|According to the Innovation Union Scoreboard, {{published}} by the European Commission every year, Sweden has been, and still is, an innovation leader within the EU {{and one of the}} most innovative countries in Europe. In the Innovation Union Scoreboard 2014 (European Union, 2014 : 5), Sweden has the top position (ranked number 1) of all EU 28 Member States in what is called “EU Member States’ Innovation Performance”. In the ranking there are 10 countries between Sweden and the EU average. This analysis is based on the rankingprovided by one single composite indicator (SII or Summary Innovation Index), based on 25 separate indicators. In this paper we argue that the SII provided by the Innovation Union Scoreboard is highly misleading. The data (the 25 separate indicators) that constitute this composite innovation indicator need to be analyzed much more in depth in order to reach a correct measure of the performance of an innovation system. We argue that <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> need to be considered separately and measured individually and as two groups of indicators. Thereafter we compare the <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> with one another (as is normally done in productivity and efficiency measurements). The outcome of this is a relevant and better measure of innovation performance. In this paper, the performance of the Swedish national innovation system is analyzed by using exactly the same data as is used by the Innovation Union Scoreboard 2014. We analyze the relative position of Sweden regarding both <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>indicators,</b> concluding that Sweden’s position as an innovation leader within the EU must be reconsidered. A theoretical background and reasons for selecting the indicators used is given and a new position regarding Sweden’s innovation performance compared to the other countries is calculated. Our findings show, that Sweden remains in a high position for the innovation input indicators, ranked number 1. However, with regard to innovation output, Sweden is ranked number 10. In other words, about a third of all European Union 28 Member States have a higher innovation output than Sweden. To estimate the efficiency or productivity of the Swedish innovation system, <b>inputs</b> and <b>outputs</b> must be related to each other. When doing so, we reach the conclusion that Sweden is ranked number 24 of EU 28 Member States. This finding is then discussed and we also discuss which countries would be relevant for Sweden to compare (benchmark) its innovation system with. The conclusion is that Sweden, based on our calculations, can certainly not be seen as an innovation leader in Europe.

By analysing similar relationships for younger firms, we are able to make a quite strong case about causation. We estimate these regional spillovers using the Literature Based Innovation <b>Output</b> <b>indicator</b> by screening two successive volumes of 43 specialist trade journals for product announcements. <b>Output</b> <b>indicators</b> for innovativeness - except for patents, which have well-known disadvantages as an indicator - are not often used in the relevant literature, partly because they are not readily available.

40|$|This paper employs both {{descriptive}} and comparative approaches to discuss {{science and technology}} (S&T) development in Arab countries in the Gulf and Mediterranean regions. Throughout the paper we use the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s definition of S&T indicators (OECD, 1997). From this research we find that neither the Gulf nor the Mediterranean countries investigated possess sufficient human or financial resources to promote S&T performance. We show that {{the low level of}} resources devoted to S&T development together with inadequate economic structures mean that the Gulf and Mediterranean Arab countries lag behind the world’s advanced and leading developing countries in terms of S&T <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> In both regions, most of the research, development and S&T activities occur within public and academic sectors, with only a very small contribution from the private sector. When comparing S&T indicators between the two Arab regions we find that despite the high standard of economic development in the Gulf countries, as measured by gross domestic product per capita and the human development index, it is the Mediterranean countries that perform better in most of the S&T <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> Furthermore, we show that there is very limited scientific cooperation within and between the Gulf and Mediterranean countries as well as between them and other Arab countries. In contrast, three Arab countries from the Mediterranean region – Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia – show active scientific cooperation with the international community, especially the OECD and France in particular. This implies that social proximity (sharing similar religion, language, culture, etc.) does not help regional scientific cooperation within the Arab world; it is geographical proximity to Europe that motivates these countries’ international scientific cooperationS&T indicators, input-output indicators, Arab Gulf countries, Arab Mediterranean countries. ...|$|R
