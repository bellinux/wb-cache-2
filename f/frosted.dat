5|$|Tiger {{are also}} mascots for various sports teams around the world. Tony the Tiger is a famous mascot for Kellogg's breakfast cereal <b>Frosted</b> Flakes. The Esso (Exxon) brand of petrol was advertised from 1969 onwards with the slogan 'put a tiger in your tank', and a tiger mascot; more than 2.5 million {{synthetic}} tiger tails {{were sold to}} motorists, who tied them to their petrol tank caps.|$|E
5|$|Film noir is {{also known}} for its use of low-angle, wide-angle, and skewed, or Dutch angle shots. Other devices of {{disorientation}} relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected {{in one or more}} mirrors, shots through curved or <b>frosted</b> glass or other distorting objects (such as during the strangulation scene in Strangers on a Train), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. Night-for-night shooting, as opposed to the Hollywood norm of day-for-night, was often employed. From the mid-1940s forward, location shooting became increasingly frequent in noir.|$|E

50|$|The {{three main}} types of ground <b>frost</b> are {{radiation}} <b>frost</b> (hoar <b>frost),</b> advection <b>frost</b> (advection hoar <b>frost)</b> and evaporation <b>frost.</b> The latter {{is a rare}} type which occurs when surface moisture evaporates into drier air causing its temperature at the surface to fall at or under the freezing point of water. Rime (both soft and hard) is technically not a type of ground <b>frost.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Undiscovered Country was {{released}} on VHS and in widescreen and pan and scan formats on Laserdisc in June 1992; the release added {{a few minutes of}} new footage to the film. Because of a trend in supermarket video sales and rentals, Paramount offered rebates for the home video release of The Undiscovered Country through boxes of Kellogg's <b>Frosted</b> Mini-Wheats. The Laserdisc version of the film was the tenth highest-selling video during 1992. The home video cut was later released for the film's 1999 DVD debut.|$|E
5|$|The first California Diamond Jubilee half dollar struck {{was given}} to the Memorial Museum in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. The die used for the initial strikings was {{specially}} treated to produce a <b>frosted</b> or cameo effect, which wore down after the first approximately 75 strikings, according to Swiatek in his later volume on commemoratives. Numismatist Kevin Flynn suggests that the first 100 pieces exhibit these special surfaces, and that this was done at Rossi's request for presentation to VIPs. One piece is known without a mint mark; this was most likely a trial piece, prepared and owned by Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock and later sold from his estate.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the crashed plane, in which Hank discovers a dead pilot and the $4.4 million in cash, was filmed on a soundstage. A second plane, designed to have <b>frosted</b> windows, was attached to a gimbal, about five feet off the ground. To match the interior with footage shot in Wisconsin, the art department built a set with real trees and a painted backdrop. To depict Hank being attacked by a flock of crows inside the plane, puppets were used to attack Paxton as he appeared on screen, while two live crows were used to attack an animatronic replica of the actor. A separate soundstage was used to create two sets depicting the interiors of the Mitchell home, where Hank and his wife Sarah (Fonda) reside. The first set was the main floor an exterior entrance way, and the second was created for the upstairs bedrooms. Principal photography concluded on March 13, 1998, after 55 days of filming.|$|E

5|$|The Albany Pine Bush {{is home to}} {{hundreds}} of species of Lepidoptera (moths), including over 40 Noctuidae considered to be pine barrens specialists. The most well-known species in the area is the Karner blue (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), discovered in the 1940s and named by the author Vladimir Nabokov. The butterfly {{is now on the}} Endangered Species List. Once found in large numbers throughout the grassy openings of the pine barrens, it is today extremely rare and found in a handful of sites. Attempts to reintroduce the butterfly focus on the food and host plant for its larvae – the wild blue lupine, which needs frequent forest fires to maintain its habitat. Other regionally rare butterflies include the dusted skipper (Atrytonopsis hianna), Henry's elfin (Incisalia henrici), <b>frosted</b> elfin (Incisalia irus), and Edward's hairstreak (Satyrium edwardsii). The inland barrens buck moth (Hemileuca maia) is a state-listed special concern animal; and other rare moths include the broad-lined catopyrrha (Catopyrrha coloraria), several noctuid moths (Apharetra purpurea, Chaetaglaea cerata, Chytonix sensilis, Macrochilo bivittata, and Zanclognatha martha), bird dropping moth (Cerma cora), and a geometrid moth (Itame). The Albarufan dagger moth was last seen in the Pine Bush in 1983 and is presumed locally extinct.|$|E

40|$|One-dimensional <b>frost</b> {{growth and}} {{densification}} in laminar flow over flat surfaces has been theoretically investigated. Improved representations of <b>frost</b> density and effective thermal conductivity applicable {{to a wide}} range of <b>frost</b> circumstances have been incorporated. The validity of the proposed model considering heat and mass diffusion in the <b>frost</b> layer is tested by a comparison of the predictions with data from various investigators for <b>frost</b> parameters including <b>frost</b> thickness, <b>frost</b> surface temperature, <b>frost</b> density and heat flux. The test conditions cover a range of wall temperature, air humidity ratio, air velocity, and air temperature, and the effect of these variables on the <b>frost</b> parameters has been exemplified. Satisfactory agreement is achieved between the model predictions and the various test data considered. The prevailing uncertainties concerning the role air velocity and air temperature on <b>frost</b> development have been elucidated. It is concluded that that for flat surfaces increases in air velocity have no appreciable effect on <b>frost</b> thickness but contribute to significant <b>frost</b> densification, while increase in air temperatures results in a slight increase the <b>frost</b> thickness and appreciable <b>frost</b> densification...|$|R

The phase change, the initiation of <b>frost</b> formation and the different shapes of <b>frost</b> crystal at various time stages are described. It is proved {{from the present study}} that the main factors that affect <b>frost</b> formation in natural convection are plate temperature, air humidity and air temperature. In order to explain the <b>frost</b> thickness difference under various conditions, a <b>frost</b> thickness growth driving force is defined and compared with the experimental results. Hydrophobic surfaces are used to release <b>frost</b> formation on cold surfaces and the results show that these surfaces can retard the formation and growth of <b>frost</b> significantly...|$|R
