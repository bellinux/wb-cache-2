The dating and understanding of the various phases of activity in the temples is not easy. The main problem <b>found</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the sites themselves are evolutionary in nature, in that each successive temple brought with it further refinement to architectural development.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} much {{scholarly}} discussion {{of the reasons for}} Daniel's refusal of the king's ration. The explanation perhaps most commonly <b>found</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Daniel and his friends wished to avoid breaking the Jewish religious laws regarding ritual slaughter (the kosher laws); alternatively, they may have wished to avoid meat and wine as these, unlike vegetables and water, were regularly used in offerings to gods (in this case, the gods of Babylon). In either case, the theological point being made is that the Jewish youths are remaining loyal to the God of Israel while still serving the foreign king.|$|E

In an interview with MTV News, the frontman explained that he was inspired by the will to document the personal changes experienced by the band and its audience. [...] "Most of the interviews", Leto explained, [...] "I did myself, so they're really intimate. It's me, it's them, and it's the camera.

Every single person has a moment in their life, something that they've found a solution for, a story to tell.

500|$|Rathbun's 1992 arrest {{caught the}} {{attention}} of her friend Donald Abrams, clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and a physician at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH). He was in Amsterdam attending an AIDS conference when he learned of Rathbun's arrest by way of CNN. [...] Rick Doblin of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies read about Rathbun's arrest in the newspaper. [...] He {{sent a letter to the}} AIDS program at SFGH proposing that [...] "Brownie Mary's institution" [...] should consider conducting clinical trials of cannabis on the wasting syndrome in AIDS patients. Inspired by Rathbun's arrest, Abrams and Doblin collaborated to develop a protocol to test the effects of cannabis on appetite and body weight. Five years later, after two of their proposed studies were rejected by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), their third research protocol, [...] "Short-Term Effects of Cannabinoids in Patients with HIV-1 Infection", was finally approved in 1997. [...] The study was funded with $978,000 from the National Institutes of Health with cannabis supplied by NIDA., DEA. : [...] "The results of that study were extremely promising and I think very surprising to NIDA in that we, one of the common concerns that NIDA had put forth was that we know that marijuana hurts the immune system, how could you possibly talk about using marijuana with people who are immuno-compromised? [...] And what Dr. Abrams <b>found</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> marijuana did not hurt the immune system, did not increase viral load, did not negatively interact with the protease inhibitors and actually did facilitate, increase caloric intake as well as weight gain, and also oral THC was included in this study as well as a placebo." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Disney Channel's {{most popular}} and {{successful}} original shows, Kim Possible remains the project for which Schooley and McCorkle are best known. Few anticipated Kim Possible would become as successful as it ultimately did, proving popular among {{both male and female}} audiences. Explaining Kim Possibles universal appeal, the creators said, [...] "Whenever there's an action complement to a show, boys get excited, and when Kim does her martial arts and when she's doing one of these incredible stunts, boys love to watch it ... And {{one of the things that}} we’ve always <b>found</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> boys of any age ... love humour and characters that are a little goofy, sort of silly and weird. When we tested it, the kids were like: 'Oh, Ron's stupid funny' and that became sort of a buzz phrase." [...] Ron's role helped maintain a strong male audience throughout the series. Kim Possible was greeted with a level of enthusiasm that had not been experienced since the Disney Afternoon Lineup, becoming Disney Channel's most successful post-1990s show. Disney Channel Worldwide President Rich Ross extolled Kim Possible as a [...] "stand-out" [...] among both the network's live-action and animated catalogue. The series maintains [...] "legions" [...] of devoted fans. A poll conducted by Disney Channel revealed that Kim Possible viewers voted for Season 3's [...] "Emotion Sickness" [...] as their favorite episode of the series. Entertainment Weekly ranked Kim Possible fourth on its list of the 25 greatest Disney Channel Original Series, calling it an [...] "animated gem". Kim Possible was placed at number nine on TV Guides ranking of [...] "The Best Disney Channel Shows". MTV ranked Kim Possible 13th in its article [...] "15 Disney Channel Series We Wish We Could Watch Again". The theme song [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] became so popular among fans of both the show and Milian herself that several of them proceeded to download it as their own cell phone ringtones.|$|E

2500|$|One {{factor that}} shows {{insignificant}} differences {{between male and}} female aggression is in sports. In sports, the rate of aggression in both contact and non-contact sports is relatively equal. Since the establishment of Title IX, female sports have increased in competitiveness and importance, which could contribute to the evening of aggression and the [...] "need to win" [...] attitude between both genders. Among sex differences found in adult sports were that females have a higher scale of indirect hostility while men have a higher scale of assault. Another difference <b>found</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> men have up to 20 times higher levels of testosterone than women.|$|E
2500|$|The Wii Zapper is a gun shell {{accessory}} for the Wii Remote. As {{shown in}} the image, the shell receives both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and contains a trigger that actuates the Wii Remote's B button; all other buttons are still accessible while the remote and Nunchuk are in the shell. The name is {{a reference to the}} NES Zapper light gun for the Nintendo Entertainment System. According to an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, the idea of a Zapper-type expansion formed when the Wii Remote was first created. He expressed that [...] "What we <b>found</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the reason we wanted to have a Zapper is when you hold a Wii Remote, it can be difficult for some people to keep a steady hand. And holding your arm out like that can get your arm somewhat tired." [...] The Zapper is useful for most games primarily involving gun-style weapons, such as light gun shooters, first-person shooters, and third-person shooters.|$|E
