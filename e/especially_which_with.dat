50|$|Density {{altitude}} is {{an important}} factor in skydiving, and one that can be difficult to judge properly even for experienced skydivers. In addition to the general change in wing efficiency common for all aviation, skydiving has additional considerations. There is an increased risk due to the high mobility of jumpers (who will often travel to a drop zone with a completely different density altitude than they are used to, without being made consciously aware of it by the routine of calibrating to QNH/QFE). Another factor is the higher susceptibility to hypoxia at high density altitudes, <b>which,</b> <b>especially</b> combined <b>with</b> the unexpected higher free fall rate, can create dangerous situations and accidents. Parachutes at higher altitudes fly more aggressively, making their effective area lower, which is more demanding for the pilot's skill and can be especially dangerous for high-performance landings, which require accurate estimates and have a low margin of error before they become dangerous.|$|R

40|$|Episodic {{hemorrhage}} is not {{a typical}} symptom of anaphylactic reaction to insect stings. Cases of reactions to honeybee (HB) sting or venom immunotherapy in which the uterus is the main target organ are very rare. Hemorrhage can be induced by HB venom components, <b>especially</b> melittin, <b>which</b> interfere <b>with</b> complement cleavage and bradykinin release. Both mechanisms are directly or indirectly associated with coagulation, thrombolysis, hemolysis, and smooth muscle tone. Induction of episodic hemorrhage through pathway destabilization in a defective bradykinin system or vulnerable organ may not be compensated by appropriate regulatory mechanisms. The pathological role of effectors is generally offset by the interaction of various regulatory systems, and the probability of hemorrhage is minimized thanks to this compensatory capability. In endometrial bleeding, the uterus becomes more vulnerable {{as a result of}} postmenstrual vascular fragility and additional induction of anaphylaxis-related uterine contractions. Episodic hemorrhage, especially metrorrhagia, as a consequence of HB venom activity may be suspected by an allergologist, but not by a physician. Melittin-free or recombinant allergens of HB venom, as well as modulators of the biochemical systems involved, could help to reduce the likelihood of hemorrhage.
