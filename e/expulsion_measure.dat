40|$|The {{independence}} of Paraguay, which {{started as a}} revolution against the power of Buenos Aires, {{the capital city of}} the viceroyalty of la Plata, did not produce any thoughts against native exploitation, and neither did it have relevant indigenous leaders or demands, although demographically speaking the indo-mestizo presence was higher than in the Banda Oriental. Paraguayan revolutionaries’ stance in relation to the indigenous population was conditioned in the first place by the strategic position of Jesuit Missions, and soon after by the policies applied by Dr. Gaspar de Francia, who after an early egalitarian impulse which favoured the gradual creation of a new unity, implemented integration and <b>expulsion</b> <b>measures</b> similar to those used during colonial times. The suppression in 1848 of the communal systems of the Guaraní people by Carlos Antonio López culminated a strategic integration within a «Paraguayan» identity. This decisive step in the shaping of the Paraguayan nation-state was completed by constructing Paraguay’s past as a Guaraní nation, thus establishing the starting point for all future Creole accounts of the nation. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of international migration in Africa poses a challenge. The continent has 56 countries or areas, 53 {{of which are}} independent states. The possibilities of international population exchanges between such {{a large number of}} units are ample. Furthermore, the dynamics of international migration movements in Africa continues to be coloured by the continent’s history of colonisation where the colonial powers imposed arbitrary borders that often divided people belonging to the same tribal or ethnic group. In addition, the need for labour to exploit the agricultural and mineral deposits of the colonies led to the forced movement of workers from one corner of a colony to another or even between colonial enclaves governed by different outside powers. These practices were {{at the root of the}} migrant worker recruitment programmes developed under formal agreements between newly independent countries after the period of colonial rule came to an end. However, as time elapsed and the economic situation of labour-receiving countries deteriorated or as the prices of the commodities they produced fluctuated in the world markets, the labour-receiving countries have often resorted to <b>expulsion</b> <b>measures</b> to reduce their foreign labour force in times of economic stringency.

40|$|The {{adoption}} in June 2008 by the European Parliament of the Directive on Return consolidates {{the process of}} involution that human rights have been suffering in the EU since the fear of illegal immigration has developed deep roots in its institutions. While {{the laws of the}} eighties regarding foreigners already contained rules governing detention and expulsion, it is not until Directive 2001 / 40 /EC that the communitarian policy focused on illegal immigration and the expulsion of migrants begins to take shape. The return measures are, as the European Commission said, “a cornerstone of immigration policy in the EU”. Since then, the barbarism of the internment and detention centres, the erosion of rights, the exclusion and criminalization of foreign migrants, have become the battle flag of the associations defending human rights. The erosion that these laws and <b>expulsion</b> <b>measures</b> are causing to the rights and freedoms and to the Constitutional State and its institutions is immense. The decline and erosion in the rights and freedoms is so great that one can no longer talk about Constitutional States in the EU, but rather about administrative machineries for the internment and deportation, and in this way, about “expelling States”(1), where foreign people are treated as “semi-persons” (2) and even as “non-persons”(3). ...|$|R
40|$|Utrecht University {{researchers}} dr. Hanneke van Eijken LL. M and Pauline Phoa, LL. M {{have prepared}} a general report {{which provides a}} comparative and critical overview of the exercise of so-called core EU citizenship rights in selected Member States (Belgium, Denmark, France, Hungary, the Netherlands and Spain). 1 Core EU citizenship rights include access to and loss of nationality (and thereby also the acquisition and loss of the EU citizenship status), the right to reside in a host Member State and in the Member State of nationality, the right to family reunification in a Member State for EU citizens, the right to free movement of EU citizens and the derogations to those rights: <b>expulsion</b> <b>measures</b> and abuse situations. Rules on nationality fall, in principle within the exclusive scope of competence of Member States. However, {{on the one hand}} the access to MS nationality opens up EU citizenship to TCN, or has consequences for migrated EU citizens and their children. On the other hand, the CJEU decision in the case of Rottmann (C- 135 / 08) has made clear that the loss of Member State nationality may bring nationality laws within the scope of EU law, as it may also affect a person’s status as EU citizen. “Under international law, it is for each Member State, having due regard to Community law, to lay down the conditions for the acquisition and loss of nationality” (par. 10). Nowadays it is clear that Member States {{have to take into account}} the outer limits of EU law in their competence to regulate nationality laws. The description of the nationality laws in the reported Member States do not always reflect an awareness on the side of the national authorities of the consequences EU citizenship rights for their nationality law. The EU citizenship right to freedom of movement and the right to reside in another Member State have been established in primary and secondary EU law for a while now, and the implementation of these rights into formal national law seem to be relatively unproblematic in most Member States. However, the answers to the questionnaire show that there is a significant gap between formal law and the actual operationalization of these rights in day-to-day (administrative and judicial) practice. Certain key concepts of EU citizenship rights, such as “sufficient resources”, are subject to differing interpretations in the different Member States, which is undesirable from the perspective of coherence and uniformity of EU law. Connected to the general EU citizenship right to free movement and residence, are the rights to family reunification, either with family members holding the nationality of another Member States, or with third country national family members. Such family members may have – under certain conditions – a right of free movement and/or residence that is derived from their EU citizen family member’s core EU citizenship rights. In this area of law, the national reports again show that there are disparities between Member States in the judicial interpretation and/or administrative application of concepts such as “dependent family member”, and “genuine relationship”, which may form obstacles to a full use of the opportunities that EU law offers. The EU Treaties and EU secondary legislation allow for certain derogations or limitations to the core EU citizenship rights of free movement and residence. Member States may take <b>expulsion</b> <b>measures</b> and measures preventing or punishing abuse of EU rights, under certain conditions. The national reports show that there are interpretive difficulties on these topics, and that there is a growing tendency to connect having insufficient resources with unlawful residence...|$|R
40|$|The {{expulsion}} of aliens in Belgium {{is a topic}} that must be studied in {{the larger context of}} immigration policy and the legal status of aliens. In the nineteenth century, the Belgian law on this subject was vague. A provisional law was enacted in 1835, during a period disrupted by conflict with The Netherlands. This law was renewed until 1897 when it became permanent. The regulations issued by the Minister of Justice and the administrative jurisprudence were used to compensate the uncertainty surrounding the provisional law. Consequently, the aliens' fate often depended on the discretionary power of the administrator of the "Sûreté publique", the principal actor in this matter. The "Sûreté publique", and in particular the "Police des étrangers" department, was seconded by the municipal police, by the "gendarmerie" and and its foreign equivalents. This collaboration sometimes had mixed results, but also resulted in quite outstanding information networks. When classifying expelled aliens using Sûreté statistics, one notes that a large majority of cases have to do with vagrancy, followed by crimes and misdemeanours and political reasons. This distribution reflects the objectives of Belgian immigration policy: ensuring public order and protecting national economic and political interests. During the 19 th century this policy shifted between severity and flexibility and depended on international events or economic conjuncture. The period beginning with the Independence and ending in the early 1850 's was characterised by security measures, because of the conflict with The Netherlands, the bad economic conjuncture and the French revolution of 1848, causing an influx of French outlaws of the Second Empire. From 1853, when the situation in France calmed down, to the Commune (1871), the political and economic situation was stable and the state's intervention was limited. From 1871 to 1914, the number of <b>expulsion</b> <b>measures</b> grew due to the Commune and the new recession. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Even when cooled {{through its}} {{transition}} {{temperature in the}} presence of an external magnetic field, a superconductor can expel nearly all external magnetic flux. This Letter presents an experimental study to identify the parameters that most strongly influence flux trapping in high purity niobium during cooldown. This is critical to the operation of superconducting radiofrequency cavities, in which trapped flux degrades the quality factor and therefore cryogenic efficiency. Flux <b>expulsion</b> was <b>measured</b> on a large survey of 1. 3 GHz cavities prepared in various ways. It is shown that both spatial thermal gradient and high temperature treatment are critical to expelling external magnetic fields, while surface treatment has minimal effect. For the first time, it is shown that a cavity can be converted from poor expulsion behavior to strong expulsion behavior after furnace treatment, resulting in a substantial improvement in quality factor. Future plans are described to build on this result in order to optimize treatment for future cavities. Comment: 5 page...|$|R
40|$|Many cnidarians contain endosymbiotic zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium sp.). These algae {{translocate}} photosynthetic {{products to}} their host. However, in high light conditions the algae may produce {{reactive oxygen species}} which can damage the host, potentially triggering algal expulsion.

In this study, algal <b>expulsion</b> was <b>measured</b> in the symbiotic sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. When the anemones were exposed to high light and high oxygen treatments, their algal density remained constant but their algal expulsion increased. Many of the expelled algae were dead, suggesting that the host may expel algae which have been damaged by reactive oxygen species. To determine if the host preferentially expels dividing algae, samples of algae that had been either expelled or artificially isolated from the host were incubated for various time periods. The mitotic index of the expelled algae initially dropped but began to increase during incubation, suggesting that the host may preferentially expel recently-divided algae. The mitotic index of the artificially isolated algae also appeared to increase during incubation, suggesting that the host may limit algal growth in hospite. ...|$|R
