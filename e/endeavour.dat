Together, the two pirate ships destroy the <b>Endeavour,</b> with a stunned Beckett going down with the ship while his navy retreats, demoralized {{by the loss of}} both the <b>Endeavour</b> and their commander in Beckett. With Will now forever bound to escort souls lost at sea to the next world, he and Elizabeth bid farewell to each other on the beach of an abandoned island. Will departs on the Dutchman, leaving Elizabeth pregnant and with the chest containing his heart.|$|E

5|$|<b>Endeavour</b> then resumed her course northward and {{parallel}} to the reef, the crew looking for a safe harbour in which to make repairs. On 13 June, the ship came to a broad watercourse that Cook named the <b>Endeavour</b> River. Cook attempted to enter the river mouth, but strong winds and rain prevented <b>Endeavour</b> from crossing the bar until the morning of 17 June. She grounded briefly on a sand spit but was refloated an hour later and warped into the river proper by early afternoon. The ship was promptly beached on the southern bank and careened to make repairs to the hull. Torn sails and rigging were also replaced and the hull scraped free of barnacles.|$|E

50|$|Mission {{managers}} extended <b>Endeavour's</b> {{flight to}} a duration of 12 days to allow <b>Endeavour's</b> crew {{to assist with}} additional maintenance tasks on the station, including work on a treadmill and replacing a failed compressor {{in one of the}} air conditioners in the Zvezda Service Module.|$|R
5|$|HMS <b>Endeavour,</b> {{also known}} as HM Bark <b>Endeavour,</b> was a British Royal Navy {{research}} vessel that Lieutenant James Cook commanded on his first voyage of discovery, to Australia and New Zealand, from 1769 to 1771.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the search for}} the remains of the ship herself, there was considerable Australian interest in locating relics of the ship's south Pacific voyage. In 1886, the Working Men's Progress Association of Cooktown sought to recover the sixcannons thrown overboard when <b>Endeavour</b> grounded on the Great Barrier Reef. A £300 reward was offered for anyone who could locate and recover the guns, but searches that year and the next were fruitless and the money went unclaimed. Remains of equipment left at <b>Endeavour</b> River were discovered in around 1900, and in 1913 the crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an <b>Endeavour</b> cannon from shallow water near the Reef.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 1771, <b>Endeavour</b> {{rounded the}} Cape of Good Hope and made port in Cape Town two days later. Those still sick were taken ashore for treatment. The ship {{remained}} in port {{for four weeks}} awaiting {{the recovery of the}} crew and undergoing minor repairs to her masts. On 15 April, the sick were brought back on board along with ten recruits from Cape Town, and <b>Endeavour</b> resumed her homeward voyage. The English mainland was sighted on 10 July and <b>Endeavour</b> entered the port of Dover two days later.|$|E
50|$|On Flight Day 4, Bob Cabana fired <b>Endeavour’s</b> rockets {{several times}} to {{maneuver}} the shuttle within Canadarm’s reach of the Zarya FGB. At 6:47 pm EST, Currie grappled Zarya. Later, at 9:07 pm EST, Cabana fired <b>Endeavour’s</b> downward jets to bring the two modules together.|$|R

5|$|STS-108 <b>Endeavour</b> {{visited the}} ISS, {{delivering}} over three tons of equipment, supplies, {{and a fresh}} crew to the orbiting outpost. The hatches were opened between <b>Endeavour</b> and the ISS Destiny Laboratory on December 7, enabling the ten crew members to greet one another. The Expedition 3 crew officially ended their 117-day residency on board the International Space Station on December 8 as their custom Soyuz seat-liners were transferred to <b>Endeavour</b> for the return trip home. The transfer of the Expedition 4 seat-liners to the Soyuz return vehicle attached to the station marked the official exchange of crews.|$|E

5|$|The second voyage was {{to reduce}} the {{garrison}} and replace HM Sloop Hound, John Burr Commander, with a smaller vessel, namely the 36-ton shallop Penguin, commander Samuel Clayton. She was a collapsible vessel and was no sooner built than taken apart, and the pieces were stowed in <b>Endeavour.</b> <b>Endeavour</b> sailed in November with Hugh Kirkland as the sailing master, and additionally the crew of Penguin, and four ship's carpenters whose job was to reassemble Penguin on arrival, which was 28 January 1773. On 17 April <b>Endeavour</b> and Hound sailed for England with their crew. One of Penguin's crew was Bernard Penrose who wrote an account. Samuel Clayton also wrote an account.|$|E

5|$|After riding {{at anchor}} for two weeks, <b>Endeavour</b> was heaved {{out of the}} water on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with shipworms, which {{required}} careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull. Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day <b>Endeavour</b> weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|In October 1769, <b>Endeavour</b> {{reached the}} {{coastline}} of New Zealand, {{becoming the first}} European vessel to do so since Abel Tasman's Heemskerck in 1642. Unfamiliar with such ships, the Māori people at Cook's first landing point in Poverty Bay thought the ship was a floating island, or a gigantic bird from their mythical homeland of Hawaiki. <b>Endeavour</b> spent {{the next six months}} sailing close to shore, while Cook mapped the coastline and concluded that New Zealand comprised two large islands and was not the hoped-for Terra Australis. In March 1770, the longboat from <b>Endeavour</b> carried Cook ashore to allow him to formally proclaim British sovereignty over New Zealand. On his return, <b>Endeavour</b> resumed her voyage westward, her crew sighting the east coast of Australia on 19 April. On 29 April, she became the first European vessel to make landfall on the east coast of Australia, when Cook landed one of the ship's boats on the southern shore of what is now known as Botany Bay, New South Wales.|$|E
