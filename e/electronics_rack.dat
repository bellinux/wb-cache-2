The influence of heat sources such as lighting fixtures, <b>electronics</b> <b>racks,</b> and pre-amplifier modules (PAMs) on the operational performance of the laser guide beam tubes and optical alignment hardware in the NE laser bays were investigated with experiments and numerical models. In particular, empirical heat transfer data was used to establish representative and meaningful boundary conditions and also serve as bench marks for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Numerical models, constructed with a commercial CFD code, were developed to investigate the extent of thermal plumes and radiation heat transfer from the heat sources. From these studies, several design modifications were recommended including reducing the size of all fluorescent lights in the NIF laser bays to single 32 W bulb fixtures, maintaining minimum separation distances between light fixtures/electronics racks and beam transport hardware, adding motion sensors in areas of the laser bay to control light fixture operation during maintenance procedures, properly cooling all <b>electronics</b> <b>racks</b> with air-water heat exchangers with heat losses greater than 25 W/rack to the M 1 laser bay, ensuring that the <b>electronics</b> <b>racks</b> are not overcooked and thus maintain their surface temperatures to within a few degrees centigrade of the mean air temperature, and insulating the electronic bays and optical support structures on the PAMs...|$|R

40|$|The Small Sample calorimeter, {{also known}} as the New Concepts calorimeter, has {{undergone}} testing in the transfer of the calorimeter operations to Los Alamos National Laboratory from EG&G Mound Applied Technology (Mound), Miamisburg, Ohio, in September 1996. The design of the calorimeter incorporated several new concepts, thus the name New Concepts. The normal water bath was replaced with a small self-contained bath and control that used a thermal electric cooling/heating device to supply the control for the bath temperature. This change replaces the large refrigeration unit that has been used in the past, thus reducing the weight and the power required to operate the system. The design was done to allow the complete calorimeter system to be contained in a single <b>electronics</b> <b>rack.</b> With the new electronics package, this change would allow the unit to use a short <b>electronics</b> <b>rack</b> with a laptop computer and make the complete system transportable. By reducing the amount of water in the bath, the control and size of the bath could also be reduced. By making the bath self-contained and sealed, there would be no need to replace water or supply de-ionized water for the system. This change would remove some of the concerns about using a water bath in certain situations. The water would be about 5 gal. or less {{depending on the size of}} the calorimeter. The present system is a 5 in. diameter sample chamber system which can accept most older material now in storage. It will not handle the new 3013 size container as built but could be easily designed for that size. There is also a new sensor design that takes less wire and can eliminate the constant current source used in past Mound calorimeter designs. With the new digital voltmeters, the complete system could be run from a single meter with the ability to monitor bath and room as well as the calorimeter operating voltages for electrical heater runs.

40|$|Introduction Today, {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} in the use of hadrontherapy as an advanced radiotherapy technique. Hadrontherapy is considered a promising tool for cancer treatment, given its high radiobiological effectiveness and high accuracy of dose deposition due to the physical properties of hadrons. However, new radiation modalities of dose delivery and on-line beam monitoring play crucial roles in a successful treatment. In hadrontherapy, through interactions between the primary beam and patient’s tissue, secondary neutrons are produced. Materials and Methods This study, by using FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations, assessed the level of secondary neutron radiation, produced during patient treatment. In addition,  the evaluation included secondary neutron radiation, which was produced while hitting the on-line detectors of beam delivery system by the Italian National Center for Hadrontherapy (CNAO). This study assessed the effects of secondary neutron radiation on an <b>electronics</b> <b>rack</b> (including a data acquisition system, a power supply, and a gas system) and a nozzle, where two monitoring boxes (each one consisting of two or three parallel plate ionization chambers) were installed. Results The resulting neutron energy spectra and radiation doses were used to determine the life performance and the probability of damage to these devices. Findings showed that by using carbon ions of 400 MeV/u, the fluence rate of secondary neutrons will be approximately 3. 4 × 1010 n/cm 2 in a year. Conclusion This value is lower than the experimental threshold, which is responsible for less than 1 % of changes in electrical characteristics, and would cause no single event upsets...|$|E
40|$|To {{minimize}} accelerating column {{damage caused}} by uncontrolled energy release during arc-downs, it is desirable to minimize the available stored electrical energy. For the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) H{sup {minus}} ion sources, the stored energy includes, {{in addition to the}} charge in the power supply output capacitance, the charge on the <b>electronics</b> <b>racks.</b> They are supported and insulated from ground by PVC pipe and have a capacitance to ground of approximately 900 pf. In 1988 (LANSCE) personnel designed a high-voltage current source using a low-stored-energy power supply and planar triode with the goal of eliminating uncontrolled release of charge stored in the power supply. Construction and testing were performed intermittently as resources permitted until 1993. When work on the Short Pulse Spallation Source (SPSS) started on the LANSCE Ion Source Test Stand (ISTS) it was recognized that a higher current power supply would be needed and work resumed on the regulator circuitry. A 120 kV power supply having low output capacitance, and a planar triode have been used to supply 40 mA, 120 Hz, 12 % duty-factor current for the ISTS beam. The triode`s cathode current is controlled by circuitry operating both at power-supply voltage level and at ground level via a fiber optic link.

40|$|NNC 04 CB 35 CThe {{probability}} of a fire occurring in space vehicles and facilities is amplified by the amounts of electrical equipment used. Additionally, the lack of egress for space personnel and irreplaceable resources used aboard space vehicles and facilities require a rapid response of a suppression system and quick extinguishment. Current experimental means that exist to gather data in space vehicles and facilities are limited by both size of the experiment and cost. Thus, more economical solutions must be considered. The aim {{of this research was}} to develop a reliable and inexpensive methodology for the prediction of flame extinction and suppression in any three-dimensional environment. This project was split into two parts. Part one included the identification and validation of a computational model for the prediction of gas dispersion. Part two involved the development of an analytical parameter for predicting flame extinction. For model validation, an experimental apparatus was constructed. The experimental apparatus was one-eighth of the volume of <b>electronics</b> <b>racks</b> found aboard typical space facilities. The experimental apparatus allowed for the addition of parallel plates to increase the complexity of the geometry. Data acquisition consisted of gas concentration measurements through planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) of nitrogen dioxide and velocity field measurements through particle image velocimetry (PIV). A theoretical framework for a generalized Damköhler number for the prediction of local flame extinction was also developed. Based on complexities in this parameter, the computational code FLUENT was determined to be the ideal means for predicting this quantity. The concentration and velocity field measurements provided validation data for the modelling analysis. Comparison of the modelling analysis with experimental data demonstrated that the FLUENT code adequately predicted the transport of gas to a remote location. The 5 FLUENT code was also used to predict gas transport at microgravity conditions. The model demonstrated that buoyancy decreases the time to achieve higher gas concentrations between the parallel plates. As an example of the use of this methodology for a combustion scenario, the model was used to predict flame extinction in a blow-off case (i. e., rapid increase in strain rate) and localized flame extinction (i. e., flame shrinking) in a low-strain dilution case with carbon dioxide over time. The model predictions demonstrated the potential of this methodology with a Damköhler number for the prediction of extinction in three-dimensional environments...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{facilities}} are inherently noisy places. Try {{as one might}} to eliminate it, there {{always seems to be}} some residual low frequency electronic hum that works its way into low level analog signals, such as calorimetry into analog-to-digital converters (ADC). At the Fermilab Wide Band Lab, the predominant noise (between experimental hall and counting room, and between <b>electronics</b> <b>racks</b> within experimental hall and within counting room) consists of a combination of 60 Hz plus 180 Hz adding together with equal amplitudes and identical phase. The noise contributions at these low frequencies are easily removed by capacitor-coupling or isolation transformers. This approach works well for most detector systems. However, for the highest rate analog detector systems, e. g. the calorimeters within the beam stops for the electron (RESH- 0), positron (POSH-O), and photon (BGM) beams for E- 831 lFOCUS, these AC couplers introduce unacceptable signal distortion and rate-dependent analog baseline shifts. The residual 60 / 180 Hz hum, between these detectors and their ADCS, is typically on the order of 10 revolt peak-to-peak at the Wide Band Laboratory, which drastically smears the pedestal spectra and constitutes the major contribution to the resolution for these detector systems. The author, rather than continue to beat his head against the wall in trying to eliminate all this noise, implemented a simple 60 Hz analog clock ramp which was read into an ADC channel simultaneously as part of the data event record and which indicated the instantaneous phase relative to the 60 Hz AC power at Wide Band Laboratory. The pedestal was then monitored and parameterized as a function of this phase. During analysis, the digitized analog system had its phase-dependent pedestal subtracted, thereby substantially reducing the low-frequency pedestal noise. The 60 Hz analog clock circuit is a simple saw-tooth ramp generator. It is packaged in two NIM modules to provide additional isolation between the 120 VAC and 6 VAC and the output ramp. The 74121 Schmitt-trigger one-shot multi-vibrator fires at approximately 1 / 3 of the (positive) amplitude of the clipped 6 VAC, providing a 4 y-see TTL reset pulse at this specific phase of the AC line voltage. No additional phase-locking or missing cycle compensation was included. The 4 p-see pulse was used to reset the charging capacitor via the 75452 switch. The 741 op amp provided buffering and offset adjustment, producing the desired sawtooth ramp from {minus} 30 revolt to {minus} 90 revolt into the 50 ohm input of the ADC. The analog ramp, along with the half-rectified 6 VAC phase is shown in Figure 2. Although the analog ramp is fairly linear, for off-line correction of pedestal noise, the only requirement is that there be a one-to-one correspondence between the analog ramp and the phase of the line power...|$|R
