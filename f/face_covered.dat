40|$|A {{large amount}} of wool on the <b>face</b> (<b>face</b> <b>cover)</b> of Merino sheep has been {{regarded}} as a fault by Australian sheep breeders {{as it has been}} associated with poor reproduction rates. Fail & Dun (1956) and Drinan & Dun (1967) reported that the degree of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> was negatively correlated with fertility, but Young, Turner & Dolling (1963) found no evidence of a genetic association. In a review of these factors, Turner & Young (1969) commented that degree of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> had been related to reduced reproduction rates in various breeds of sheep in Australia, New Zealand and the United States but not in the Soviet Union. The degree of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> of individual ewes changes with season, and during pregnancy and lactation, with pregnant and lactating ewes showing less <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> than their non-pregnant contemporaries in the same flock (Mullaney, 1965). Physiological status of the ewe could therefore influence phenotypic assessment and {{may have contributed to the}} conflict of opinion on the importance of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> as a criterion of selection. In the course of experiments on diluents for ram semen involving the artificial insemination (AI) of fine-wool Merinos (Saxony strain), we were able to make observations on semen production and factors associated with oestrus and fertility, and relate these to the degree of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> of ewes and rams.

5|$|Punk {{continued}} to show messianic traits, frequently giving sermons including during the annual Royal Rumble match {{as well as}} during an Elimination Chamber match at both of the eponymous pay-per-views. In the Chamber match, he was eliminated by Rey Mysterio, whom he had feuding with leading into the PPV. Tensions escalated as Mysterio prevented him from winning a Money in the Bank qualifying match, causing Punk to interrupt Mysterio's celebration of his daughter's ninth birthday. Mysterio challenged Punk to a Street Fight at WrestleMania XXVI but lost to Gallows. Punk added the stipulation that if Rey lost, he would join the Society. At WrestleMania, Punk lost to Mysterio sparking a rematch at Extreme Rules where Punk would have to shave his head, like his disciples, if he lost. Punk won this match after interference from a fourth member of the Society who kept his <b>face</b> <b>covered.</b> At Over The Limit, a third and final match was booked with both stipulations reactivated.

25|$|During {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} upon his {{exit from the}} treatment center in 1955, Lugosi stated {{that he was about}} to go to work on a new Ed Wood film, The Ghoul Goes West.

With Lugosi in his famed Dracula cape, Wood shot impromptu test footage, with no storyline in mind, in front of Tor Johnson's home, a suburban graveyard and in front of Lugosi's apartment building on Carlton Way. This footage ended up in Plan 9 from Outer Space, which was mostly filmed after Lugosi's death. Wood hired Tom Mason, his wife's chiropractor, to double for Lugosi in additional shots.

40|$|With {{respect to}} a given plane graph, G, a <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> {{is defined as a}} set of faces whose {{boundaries}} collectively contain every vertex in G. It is known that, when k is fixed, finding a cover of size k (if indeed any exist) can be accomplished in polynomial time.

A major goal has been to reduce the time required for branching, which is the most computationally-intensive aspect of fixed-parameter tractable methods.

40|$|The {{parameterized}} {{complexity of}} the <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> problem is considered. The input to this problem is a plane graph G with n vertices. The question asked is whether, for a given parameter value k, there exists a set of k or fewer faces whose boundaries collectively cover (contain) every vertex in G. Early attempts achieved run times of O∗(k 12) or worse, by reducing the problem into a special form of dominating set, namely red–blue dominating set, restricted to planar graphs. Here, we consider a direct approach, where some surgical operation is performed on the graph at each branching decision. This paper builds on previous work {{of the authors and}} employs a structure theorem of Aksionov et al., with a detailed case analysis, to produce a <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> algorithm that runs in O(k 4. 6056 +n 2) time. We also point to the tight connections with red–blue dominating set on planar graphs via the annotated version of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> that we consider in our search tree algorithm. Hence, we get both a O(k 4. 6056 +n 2) time algorithm for solving red–blue dominating set on planar graphs and a polynomial time algorithm for producing a linear kernel for annotated <b>face</b> <b>cover.</b> PublishedN/...|$|R
