5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> custody in which, {{rather than having}} the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in attachment theory, infants {{need to develop}} a relationship with a primary caregiver to achieve normal social and emotional development. A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to language development, joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> attention involving smiling at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in infants. Early joint attention abilities account for differences in social and emotional abilities in later life.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{mechanical}} behavior <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> in the castellated portal frame of light-weight steel under static loads, a static loads experiment has been performed for these new joints in this paper. The experiment members include four castellated joints and one solid-web <b>joint</b> <b>of</b> original steel, considering three vary parameters which are connection <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints,</b> joint region with setting stiffener and {{the distance from the}} center <b>of</b> hole to <b>joint</b> region. Experiment shows: the stiffness <b>of</b> castellated <b>joints</b> is higher than the one <b>of</b> solid-web <b>joint.</b> The parameters have a great influence on the mechanical behavior <b>of</b> <b>joints,</b> except the connection <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R
500|$|There {{are some}} {{inherent}} benefits to {{this form of}} custody arrangement. One main benefit of having joint legal custody is that the parents are legal equals, which means that both parents influence important decisions in the child's upbringing, which leads to less animosity and negativity between the parents, along with encouraging both parents to be proactive in the child's upbringing. A second benefit of having joint legal custody is that the parents exhibit a feeling of well being knowing they are working together in making decisions based on what their child's/children's needs are. This <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> custody enables parents to focus solely on the children, {{with the emphasis on}} {{the health and well-being of}} the child/children. [...] By doing so, this has the potential to reverse some of the emotional effects on the children in the long-run. [...] Another benefit of joint legal custody is that it fosters an environment in which the parents of the child have some form of a means of communication in which open dialogue can lead to ensuring a safe, nurturing environment for the child.|$|E

[...] In June 2010, the Indian Air Force planned to receive 50 of the single-seat [...] "Russian version" [...] before receiving the two-seat FGFA. [...] Then in an October 2012 interview the Chief of Air Staff of India, NAK Browne, said that the IAF will purchase 144 of the single-seat FGFA. To reduce development costs and timelines, the IAF plans to begin induction of the FGFA in 2020.|$|E
2500|$|The {{secondary}} assembly was {{the actual}} SHRIMP {{component of the}} weapon. The weapon, like most contemporary weapons at that time, bore the same code-name as the secondary. The secondary was situated in the cylindrical end of the device, where its end was locked to the radiation case by a type of mortise and tenon joint. The hohlraum at its cylindrical end had an internal projection, which nested the secondary and had better structural strength to support the secondary's assembly, which had most of the device's mass. A visualisation to {{this is that the}} joint looked much like a cap (the secondary) fitted in a cone (the projection of the radiation case). Any other supporting structure would cause radiation transfer blockade and complex vibrational behavior. With this <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint,</b> the secondary and the hohlraum behaved as a single mass sharing common eigenvalues (eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes). The other end of the radiation case was shaped like a parabola to focus the radiation emitted by the fission device. The secondary assembly was an elongated truncated cone. From its front part to its aft section it was steeply tapered. Tapering was used for two reasons. First, radiation drops sharply by distance, as a function divided by the square of the distance, and radiation coupling is relatively poor. This made the use of a higher mass of the then scarce fusion fuel in the rear end of the secondary assembly inefficient and the whole device wasteful. This was also the reason why the lower-enriched slugs of fusion fuel were placed far aft of the fuel capsule. Second, as the primary could not illuminate the whole surface of the hohlraum, in part due to the large axial length of the secondary, relatively small solid angles would be effective to compress the secondary, leading to poor radiation focusing. By tapering, the hohlraum acted in a form of a quasi-parabola in its aft section without having to machine the radiation case to a parabola at both ends, amplifying the radiation focusing and enabling a streamlined production line, as it was cheaper, faster and easier to manufacture the radiation case with only one parabolic end. The tapering in this design was much steeper than its cousins, the RUNT, and the ALARM CLOCK devices. SHRIMP's tapering apparently made the whole secondary assembly resemble the body of a shrimp. The secondary's length is defined by the two pairs of dark-colored diagnostic hot spot pipes attached to the middle and left section of the device. These pipe sections [...] in diameter by [...] long were butt-welded end-to-end to the ballistic case leading out {{to the top of the}} shot cab. They would carry the initial reaction's light up to the array of 12 mirror towers built in an arc on the artificial [...] shot island created for the event. From those pipes, mirrors would reflect early bomb light from the bomb casing to a series of remote high-speed cameras, so that Los Alamos could determine both the simultaneity of the design (i.e. the time interval between primary's firing and secondary's ignition) and the thermonuclear burn rate in these two crucial areas of the secondary device.|$|E

In {{order to understand the}} origins <b>of</b> musical <b>joint</b> action, we propose a model in which entrainment is linked to dual mechanisms (motor resonance and action simulation), which in turn support musical behavior (imitation and complementary joint action). To illustrate this model, we consider two generic <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> musical behavior: chorusing and turn-taking. We explore how these common behaviors can be founded on entrainment capacities established early in human development, specifically during musical interactions between infants and their caregivers. If the roots of entrainment are found in early musical interactions which are practiced from childhood into adulthood, then we propose that the rehearsal of advanced musical ensemble skills can be considered to be a refined, mimetic <b>form</b> <b>of</b> temporal and affective entrainment whose evolution begins in infancy...|$|R
