5000|$|The current {{bridge is}} of the Burr Truss design, which was {{patented}} by Theodore Burr, brother of U.S. Vice President Aaron Burr, in 1817. [...] The bridge spans a length of 204 ft across the river, making the bridge the longest still-standing covered bridge in Virginia. [...] Two stone abutments, which extend ten feet below the riverbed, support the bridge {{on the sides of}} the river. The rock used in the abutments was gathered from local quarries. The bridge consists of two arches on each side spanning the length of the bridge and joining the abutments 8 ft below the top of the abutments' stone construction. The arches are constructed of three sections each of 7 in by 15 in timbers bolted together. The vertical truss supports and horizontal roof supports are composed of 8 in by 10 in lumber. The <b>diagonal</b> <b>truss</b> supports are 7 in by 9 in timbers. Originally, the floor supports consisted of two 7 in by 12 in beams along the length of the bridge and 4 in by 14 in beams supporting the roadway running from side to side.

40|$|Abstract. A {{procedure}} {{derived from}} truss model {{was established to}} predict rapidly the failure mode of a reinforced concrete column in the design stage. Failure mode of an RC column can be classified as either shear or flexural failure. In general, an RC column can be {{assumed to be a}} beam-column member subjected to combined axial, flexural, and shear forces. It is difficulty to predict its overall failure behavior without a priori knowledge. Thus in this paper, the shear capacity is isolated independently from the complex behavior of a column based on the concept of well known truss model. The shear capacity can be viewed as the contribution of <b>diagonal</b> <b>truss</b> of a truss model while the longitudinal truss modeled the combined axial-flexural behavior. The obtained shear capacity using the proposed method can be compared with flexural capacity obtained from pushover analysis to predict whether shear failure or flexural failure will occur during cyclic test of an RC column. Five cyclic test results were compared to the predicted analytical results. All five failure modes are successfully predicted using the proposed procedure...|$|E

40|$|Various {{automotive}} lifts use four cantilevered arms {{to elevate}} and support vehicles on adapter pads positioned on their free ends. These arms, when raised, {{are supposed to}} be restrained against rotation in a horizontal plane. When restrained, the arms provide a robust structural system for resisting horizontal workplace forces that tend to slide vehicles off the pads. The arms maintain the horizontal locations of the adapters by developing bending and axial planar resistance. If, on the other hand, the arms are free to pivot through sloth or poor design, their structural behavior is dramatically transformed. The planar bending resistance of the arms completely disappears and they become direct stress <b>diagonal</b> <b>truss</b> members; the vehicle itself unwittingly becomes the truss ’ tension chord. The appearance of the fixed and pivoting systems is the same; however, the truss action magnifies the horizontal forces acting on the adapter pads increasing the slip probability. Indeed, depending on the orientation of the pivoting swing arms, any finite horizontal force applied to a vehicle may lead to an unbounded tangential “slide-out ” force. This is, of course, a theoretical possibility, not a practical reality...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} investigation into the behaviour of precast hybrid FRP-concrete, two-panel truss girders under static loading are presented. The investigation {{is part of a}} comprehensive research program on the development of a corrosion-free system for short and medium span bridges. The truss girders consist of pretensioned concrete chords connected by vertical and <b>diagonal</b> <b>truss</b> elements made of glass FRP tubes filled with concrete. The truss elements are reinforced and connected to the top and bottom chords by means of long double-headed steel or glass FRP bars. The top and bottom chords are also reinforced with glass FRP stirrups and double-headed longitudinal bars. This new system is expected to reduce the initial and maintenance costs and enhance the durability of bridges, and thus, extend their useful life. Moreover, by replacing the solid concrete web of traditional precast I-girders with the truss elements, the weight of the structure is significantly reduced, and thus, longer spans can be achieved and the number of supporting piers and size of the substructure can be reduced. The main objective of the research presented herein was to examine the efficiency of the FRP in comparison to steel reinforcement. The work included fabricating and testing three large-scale two-panel truss girders with an overall depth of 1. 32 m and length of 2. 83 m. The test parameters included the type and amount of reinforcement. The girders were tested under monotonic loading up to failure.

40|$|The {{stresses}} induced in {{a structure}} by a seismic action {{have a low}} probability of occurrence and their magnitude is such that the structure is forced beyond the ultimate limit state. The effective standards in Portugal, {{and the ones that}} will be effective shortly, consider the possibility of a seismic action in all the territory, fact that has been neglect by designers and authorities in the last years. This new standard, Eurocode 8, Design of structures for earthquake resistance, defines new standards for infill walls, imposing the use of reinforcement but failing to give detailed information besides the type of reinforcement. Furthermore, the structural designer is the responsible for these non-structural elements. Therefore, with the goal of contributing to the creation of simple design rules for these infills, a shaking table test program of reinforced concrete frame buildings with infill walls, reinforced and unreinforced, will be carried out. Predeceasing these tests, different numerical simulations of the buildings were carried out, with two main objectives: i) understand the behavior of the structure when subjected to a seismic action, in order to more accurately define the experimental program; ii) using different computational programs and numerical elements to perform static non-linear analyses, assess the capability of a commercial Finite Element Method (FEM) software, SAP 2000, to simulate infill walls by means of a diagonal strut, comparing it to a more generic and powerful tool, DIANA. With SAP 2000, the analyses were done with and without infills, and these were simulated using diagonal strut bar elements. In all models, hinges with concentrated non linear relations (axial force, bending moment or both, depending on the element) were assigned to the bar elements. With DIANA, the same static non-linear analysis were made, simulating the infill walls by means of a regular mesh, {{as an alternative to the}} <b>diagonal</b> <b>truss</b> elements of the previous analysis. Non-linearity was implemented using a total strain crack model. After analysing the obtained results, using bar elements on SAP 2000 and DIANA led to similar results, regardless to the presence of infill walls simulated as diagonal struts. The failure modes were not affected by the use of different elements to simulate the infill although, to better analyse this phenomenon, a FEM mesh with a constitutive law that more accurately considers the shear failure should be used...|$|E

In particular, the proposed formulation is based on the extension of existing formulations for the prediction of the resistance of steel dowels to the case of inclined steel bars loaded against concrete, accounting for the following effects: lateral and top confinement, mechanical non-linearity of materials, length of the plastic hinge arising in the steel bar and influence of moment-shear-axial force interaction effect. The accuracy of the model is verified with the available experimental data collected from the technical literature and with FE results obtained from a parametric analysis carried out by the same authors in a previous work...|$|R
