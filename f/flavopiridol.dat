40|$|AbstractThe {{synthetic}} flavone <b>flavopiridol</b> can be cytostatic or cytotoxic to mammalian cells, {{depending on}} the concentration of the drug and the duration of exposure. It {{has been shown to}} inhibit the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family of cell cycle regulatory enzymes. However, the existence of additional potential targets for drug action remains a matter of interest to define. To identify cellular targets, <b>flavopiridol</b> was immobilized. CDKs, particularly CDK 4, bound weakly to immobilized <b>flavopiridol</b> when ATP was absent but not in its presence. Two proteins with molecular weights of 40 kDa and 120 kDa had high affinities to the immobilized <b>flavopiridol</b> independent of the presence of ATP. They were present in all cell lines analyzed: cervical (HeLa), prostate and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines. A 60 -kDa protein, which was present only in NSCLC cells and bound similarly well to immobilized <b>flavopiridol,</b> was identified as cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase class 1 (ALDH- 1). The level of this protein correlated with the resistance of NSCLC cell lines to cytotoxicity caused by 500 nM <b>flavopiridol</b> but not higher <b>flavopiridol</b> concentrations. Despite binding to ALDH- 1, there was no inhibition of dehydrogenase activity by <b>flavopiridol</b> concentrations as high as 20 μM and <b>flavopiridol</b> was not metabolized by ALDH- 1. The results suggest that high cellular levels of ALDH- 1 may reduce cytotoxicity of <b>flavopiridol</b> and contribute to relative resistance to the drug.

As such, we explored the potentiation of doxorubicin by <b>flavopiridol</b> in sarcoma, in vitro and in vivo, and conducted a phase I trial of <b>flavopiridol</b> with doxorubicin in patients with advanced sarcomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sarcoma cell lines and xenografts were treated with <b>flavopiridol</b> alone and in combination with doxorubicin. In the phase I study, doxorubicin and <b>flavopiridol</b> were administered on two <b>flavopiridol</b> schedules; a 1 -hour bolus and split dosing as a 30 -minute bolus followed by a 4 -hour infusion. RESULTS: Preclinically, <b>flavopiridol</b> potentiated doxorubicin. In vivo, doxorubicin administered 1 hour before <b>flavopiridol</b> was more active than doxorubicin alone. Clinically, 31 patients were enrolled on protocol and <b>flavopiridol</b> was escalated to target dose in two schedules (90 mg/m(2) bolus; 50 mg/m(2) bolus + 40 mg/m(2) infusion) both in combination with doxorubicin (60 mg/m(2)). Dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenia, leukopenia, and febrile neutropenia but no maximum tolerated dose was defined. <b>Flavopiridol</b> pharmacokinetics showed increasing C(max) with increasing dose.

40|$|Abstract Background Rhabdoid Tumors (RTs) {{are highly}} {{aggressive}} pediatric malignancies with poor prognosis.

Our previous studies indicated that targeting the cyclin/cdk pathway is a novel therapeutic strategy for RTs and that a pan-cdk inhibitor, <b>flavopiridol,</b> inhibits RT growth. Since the toxicities and narrow window of activity associated with <b>flavopiridol</b> may limit its clinical use, we tested the effect of combining <b>flavopiridol</b> with 4 -hydroxy-Tamoxifen (4 OH-Tam) {{in order to reduce}} the concentration of <b>flavopiridol</b> needed for inhibition of RTs. Methods The effects of <b>flavopiridol,</b> 4 OH-Tam, and their combination on RT cell cycle regulation and apoptosis were assessed by: i) cell survival assays, ii) FACS analysis, iii) caspase activity assays, and iv) immunoblot analysis. Furthermore, the role of p 53 in flavopiridol- and 4 OH-Tam-mediated induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was characterized using RNA interference (siRNA) analysis. The effect of p 53 on flavopiridol-mediated induction of caspases 2, 3, 8 and 9 was also determined. Results We found that the combination of <b>flavopiridol</b> and 4 OH-Tam potently inhibited the growth of RT cells. Low nanomolar concentrations of <b>flavopiridol</b> induced G 2 arrest, which was correlated to down-modulation of cyclin B 1 and up-regulation of p 53. Addition of 4 OH-Tam did not affect flavopiridol-mediated G 2 arrest, but enhanced caspase 3, 7 -mediated apoptosis induced by the drug. Abrogation of p 53 by siRNA abolished flavopiridol-induced G 2 arrest, but enhanced flavopiridol- (but not 4 OH-Tam-) mediated apoptosis, by enhancing caspase 2 and 3 activities. Conclusions Combining <b>flavopiridol</b> with 4 OH-Tam potently inhibited the growth of RT cells by increasing the ability of either drug alone to induce caspases 2 and 3 thereby causing apoptosis. The potency of <b>flavopiridol</b> was enhanced by abrogation of p 53.

40|$|Summary The multidrug {{resistance}} protein 1 (MRP 1) is an ATP-dependent transport protein for organic anions, {{as well as}} neutral or positively charged anticancer agents.

A new specific monoclonal antibody against MRP 1 (MIB 6) inhibits the (iso) flavonoid-induced ATPase activity of plasma membrane vesicles prepared from the MRP 1 overexpressing cell line GLC /ADR.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Flavopiridol,</b> a small {{molecule}} pan-cyclin inhibitor, {{has been}} shown to enhance the radiation response of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. The clinical utility of <b>flavopiridol,</b> however, is limited by toxicity, previously attributed to pleiotropic inhibitory effects on several targets affecting multiple signal transduction pathways. Here we utilized zebrafish embryos to investigate radiosensitizing effects of <b>flavopiridol</b> in normal tissues. Methods and Materials: Zebrafish embryos at the 1 - 4 cell stage were treated with 500 nM <b>flavopiridol</b> or injected with 0. 5 pmol antisense hydroxylprolyl-phosphono nucleic acid oligomers to reduce cyclin D 1 expression, then subjected to ionizing radiation (IR) or no radiation. Results: Flavopiridol-treated embryos demonstrated a 2 -fold increase in mortality following exposure to 40 Gy by 96 hours post fertilization (hpf) and developed distinct radiation-induced defects in midline development (curly-up phenotype) at higher rates when compared to embryos receiving IR only. Cyclin D 1 -deficient embryos had virtually identical IR sensitivity profiles when compared to embryos treated with <b>flavopiridol.</b> This was particularly evident for the IR-induced curly-up phenotype, which was greatly exacerbated by both flavopriridol and cyclin D 1 downregulation. Conclusions: Treatment of zebrafish embryos with <b>flavopiridol</b> enhanced radiation sensitivity of zebrafish embryos to a degree that was very similar to that associated with downregulation of cyclin D 1 expression.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Flavopiridol</b> is a {{cyclin-dependent kinase}} inhibitor. It has shown an {{antitumor}} effect against several cancers. In the present study, the radiation-sensitizing effect of flavopir-idol {{was investigated in}} an esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line, Eca 109. The growth inhibitory rate of Eca 109 with <b>flavopiridol</b> was determined using the MTT and the radio-sensitizing rate using clonogenic survival assays.

The proteins cyclin D 1, ERK/pERK, caspase- 3, Bax and Bcl- 2 were detected using western blot analysis to elucidate the mechanism of the radiosensitization effect. MTT assay showed that <b>flavopiridol</b> inhibited the survival rate of Eca 109 cells and the effect was dose-depen-dent. Its IC 50 was 193. 3 nmol/l. The result of the clonogenic survival revealed that <b>flavopiridol</b> enhanced the radiosensi-tivity of Eca 109 cells and the sensitization enhancement ratio (SER) was 1. 194 at 0. 2 xIC 50.

In this study we show that <b>flavopiridol,</b> a synthetic flavonoid currently studied in phase 1 trials for its anti-proliferative characteristics, interacts with MRP 1 in a potent way. <b>Flavopiridol,</b> {{as well as other}} (iso) flavonoids stimulate the ATPase activity of MRP 1 in a dose-dependent way at low micromolar concentrations. A new specific monoclonal antibody against MRP 1 (MIB 6) inhibits the (iso) flavonoid-induced ATPase activity of plasma membrane vesicles prepared from the MRP 1 overexpressing cell line GLC 4 /ADR. The accumulation of daunorubicin in GLC 4 /ADR cells is increased by <b>flavopiridol</b> and by other non-glycosylated (iso) flavonoids that interact with MRP 1 ATPase activity. However, <b>flavopiridol</b> is the only tested compound that affects the daunorubicin accumulation when present at concentrations below 1 μM. Glycosylated (iso) flavonoids do not affect MRP 1 -mediated transport or ATPase activity. Finally, MRP 1 overexpressing and transfected cells are resistant to <b>flavopiridol,</b> but not to other (iso) flavonoids tested.

A pharmacologically derived “hybrid” schedule (30 -minute bolus followed by 4 -hour infusion) of <b>flavopiridol</b> was more effective than bolus administration in refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Our phase 1 trial “hybrid FLAM” in 55 adults with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias began at a total <b>flavopiridol</b> dose of 50 mg/m 2 per day 3 times (20 -mg/m 2 bolus, 30 -mg/m 2 infusion). Dose-limiting toxicity occurred at level 6 (30 -mg/m 2 bolus, 70 -mg/m 2 infusion) with tumor lysis, hyperbilirubinemia, and mucositis. Death occurred in 5 patients (9 %). Complete remission occurred in 22 (40 %) across all doses. Overall and disease-free survivals for complete remission patients are more than 60 % at more than 2 years.

40|$|<b>Flavopiridol</b> {{is active}} against chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) cells in vitro and {{in the treatment of}} advanced stage disease, but the mechanisms of these actions remain unclear. Originally developed as a general cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, <b>flavopiridol</b> is a potent transcriptional suppressor through the inhibition of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb; CDK 9 /cyclin T). P-TEFb phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II to promote transcriptional elongation. Because most CLL cells are not actively cycling, and their viability is dependent upon the continuous expression of antiapoptotic proteins, we hypothesized that <b>flavopiridol</b> induces apoptosis in CLL cells through the transcriptional down-regulation of such proteins. This study demonstrated that <b>flavopiridol</b> inhibited the phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA polymerase II in primary CLL cells and reduced RNA synthesis. This was associated with a decline of the transcripts and the levels of short-lived antiapoptotic proteins such as myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl- 1), and resulted in the induction of apoptosis. The B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl- 2) protein level remained stable, although its mRNA was consistently reduced, suggesting that the outcome of transcriptional inhibition by <b>flavopiridol</b> is governed by the intrinsic stability of the individual transcripts and proteins. The dependence of CLL-cell survival on short-lived oncoproteins may provide the biochemical basis for the therapeutic index in response to <b>flavopiridol.</b> (Blood. 2005; 106 : 2513 - 2519...|$|E

40|$|<b>Flavopiridol</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to induce apoptosis in lym-phoid cell lines via downregulation of bcl- 2. The in vitro activity of <b>flavopiridol</b> against human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and potential mechanisms of action for inducing cytotoxicity were studied. The in vitro viability of mononuclear cells from CLL patients (n 5 11) was reduced by 50 % at 4 hours, 24 hours, and 4 days at a <b>flavopiridol</b> concentration of 1. 15 mmol/L (95 % confidence interval [CI] 60. 31), 0. 18 mmol/L (95 % CI 60. 04), and 0. 16 mmol/L (95 % CI 60. 04), respectively. Loss of viability in human CLL cells correlated with early induction of apoptosis.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) to the cellular uptake of <b>flavopiridol</b> {{was investigated in}} OATP 1 B 1 -, OATP 1 B 3 - and OATP 2 B 1 -expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Uptake of <b>flavopiridol</b> into these cells showed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with much higher transport capacity for OATP 1 B 3 compared to OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 2 B 1 (Vmax/Km, 33. 9 vs. 8. 84 and 2. 41  µl/mg/min, respectively). The predominant role of OATPs was further supported by a dramatic inhibition of <b>flavopiridol</b> uptake {{in the presence of}} the OATP substrate rifampicin. Uptake of <b>flavopiridol</b> by OATPs also seems to be an important determinant in breast cancer cells. The much higher mRNA level for OATP 1 B 1 found in wild-type compared to ZR- 75 - 1 OATP 1 B 1 knockdown cells correlated with higher <b>flavopiridol</b> initial uptake leading to 4. 6 -fold decreased IC 50 values in the cytotoxicity assay (IC 50, 1. 45 vs. 6. 64  µM). Cell cycle profile also showed a clear incidence for a stronger cell cycle arrest in the G 2 /M phase for ZR- 75 - 1 wild-type cells compared to OATP 1 B 1 knockdown cells, further indicating an active uptake via OATP 1 B 1. In conclusion, our results revealed OATP 1 B 1, OATP 1 B 3 and OATP 2 B 1 as uptake transporters for <b>flavopiridol</b> in cancer cells, which may also apply in patients during cancer therapy...|$|E
40|$|An den beiden Ovarialkarzinomzelllinien SKOV- 3 und BG 1 wurden neben dem bereits in der Therapie etablierten Carboplatin die Proteasomen-Inhibitoren Bortezomib und MG- 115 und der CDK-Inhibitor <b>Flavopiridol</b> mittels Durchflusszytometrie auf ihre {{antiproliferative}} Wirkung untersucht. Dabei konnte im Rahmen der Zellzyklusanalyse und des Annexin-V-Assays für alle vier Medikamente eine zeit- und konzentrationsabhängige antiproliferative Wirkung nachgewiesen werden. Da die Signaltransduktionswege der Apoptose mögliche Angriffpunkte in der modernen Tumortherapie darstellen, wurden aus den beiden Hauptsignalwegen exemplarisch Proteine ausgewählt, deren Detektion mittels Western Blot über eine mögliche Aktivierung durch die Medikamente Auskunft geben soll. Während bei beiden Zelllinien die zeit- und konzentrationsabhängige Apoptoseinduktion über den extrinsischen Weg durch Bortezomib nachgewiesen werden kann, gelingt dies nach Inkubation mit <b>Flavopiridol</b> lediglich bei den BG 1 -Zellen. Neben der Wirkung der Reinsubstanzen auf die Ovarialkarzinomzelllinien wurde der Frage nach einem möglichen Synergismus von <b>Flavopiridol</b> und den Proteasomeninhibitoren in Kombination mit Carboplatin nachgegangen. Dabei zeigt nur die Kombination von <b>Flavopiridol</b> mit Carboplatin konzentrationsabhängig eine signifikant synergistische antiproliferative Wirkung. Nach simultaner Behandlung mit Bortezomib und Carboplatin lässt sich bei der SKOV- 3 -Zelllinie, sowohl durchflusszytometrisch als auch im Western Blot, sogar ein deutlich antagonistischer Effekt dokumentieren. Als Schaltstelle vieler Signaltransduktionswege in der Zelle bietet die Interaktion mit dem NFκB-Protein einen viel versprechenden Ansatz in der Entwicklung neuer Strategien der Tumortherapie. Mittels ELISA wurde deshalb dessen Aktivität im Zytosol beider Karzinomzelllinien nach Inkubation mit den vier Substanzen untersucht. Während sich bei den BG 1 -Zellen eine Zunahme der NfĸB-Aktivität sowohl durch Carboplatin als Reinsubstanz, wie auch in Kombination mit <b>Flavopiridol</b> und den beiden Proteasomen-Inhibitoren abzeichnet, kommt es bei den SKOV- 3 -Zellen lediglich durch <b>Flavopiridol</b> zu einer signifikanten Modulation des Aktivitätslevels. Auch nach Kombination mit Carboplatin zeigt nur jener mit <b>Flavopiridol</b> inkubierte SKOV- 3 -Ansatz einen signifikanten Synergismus durch den Zusatz des Platinderivats. In {{this study}} we examined the antiproliferating effect of carboplatin, which is already established in ovarian carcinomas as the first line therapy, {{as well as the}} proteasome-inhibitors bortezomib, MG- 115 and the CDK-inhibitor <b>flavopiridol</b> using ovarian carcinoma cell lines like SKOV- 3 and BG 1. Cell cycle-analysis and apoptosis-assay show time- and dose-dependent antiproliferating effect for all four drugs. Signal transduction pathways of apoptosis are potential working points in modern tumour-therapy. Exemplary proteins from both main pathways of apoptosis were selected, whose detection in western blot provides information on the potential activation of the apoptosis cascade. While both cell lines show a time- and dose-dependend induction of apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway after treatment with bortezomib, the effectiveness of <b>flavopiridol</b> can only be established for BG 1 -cells. Apart from effects of pure substances on tumour cells potential synergies of <b>flavopiridol</b> and proteasome-inhibitors with carboplatin were analysed. While for BG 1 -cells a significant dose-dependent synergistic antiproliferating effect after incubation with both flavopridol and carboplatin was detected, the SKOV- 3 -cellline only showed a tendency of increasing apoptosis without any correlate in western blot analysis. After simultaneous treatment with bortezomib and carboplatin an antagonistic effect on SKOV- 3 -cells by means of flowcytometry as well as western blot analysis can be demonstrated. Flowcytometry detected only an additive effect of a combined application of bortezomib with carboplatin on modulation of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis in BG 1 -cells. As a switchpoint of many signal transduction pathways in cells, the interaction with NFκB seems to provide a promising approach for the development of new strategies in tumour therapy. Via ELISA, we investigated the activity of the NFκB-protein in cytoplasma of ovarian cancer cell lines after incubation with carboplatin, flavopridol and proteasome inhibitors. While both single agent carboplatin as well as a combination of carboplatin with <b>flavopiridol</b> and proteasome-inhibitors in BG 1 -cells lead to increasing activity of NfĸB, only the treatment with <b>flavopiridol</b> showed a significant modulation for the case of SKOV- 3 -cells.

40|$|Background The loss of {{cell cycle}} {{regulation}} due to abnormal function of cyclin-dependent kinases(cdk) occurs in tumors {{and leads to}} genetic instability of chemotherapy-resistant cells. In this study, we investigated {{the effect of the}} cdk inhibitor <b>flavopiridol</b> in anaplastic large cell lymphomas, in which unrestrained proliferation depends on NPM-ALK tyrosine kinase activity. Design and Methods Effects of <b>flavopiridol</b> were examined in ALK-positive and -negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells by means of immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses to assess cdk expression and activity, quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to measure drug-induced changes in transcription, and FACS analyses to monitor changes in proliferation and survival. Results Treatment with <b>flavopiridol</b> resulted in growth inhibition of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells, along with accumulation of subG 1 cells and disappearance of S phase without cell cycle arrest. Consistent with <b>flavopiridol</b> activity, phosphorylation at cdk 2, cdk 4, cdk 9 sites on RB and RNA polymerase II was inhibited. This correlated with induction of cell death through rapid mitochondrial damage, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins and transcripts. Notably, <b>flavopiridol</b> was less active in ALK-positive cells, as apoptosis was observed at higher concentrations and later time points, and resistance to treatment was observed in cells maintaining NPM-ALK signaling. NPM-ALK inhibition affected proliferation but not survival of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells, whereas it resulted in a dramatic increase in apoptosis when combined with <b>flavopiridol.</b> Conclusions This work provides the first demonstration that targeting cdk is effective against anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells, and proves the critical role of NPM-ALK in the regulation of responsiveness of tumor cells with cdk dysregulation...|$|E
40|$|Angiogenesis is a {{critical}} step required for sustained tumor growth and tumor progression. The stimulation of endothelial cells by cytokines secreted by tumor cells such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces their proliferation and migration. This is a prominent feature of high-grade gliomas. The secretion of VEGF is greatly upregulated under conditions of hypoxia because of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - 1 α, which controls the expression of many genes, allowing rapid adaptation of cells to their hypoxic microenvironment. <b>Flavopiridol,</b> a novel cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, has been attributed with antiangiogenic properties in some cancer cell lines by its ability to inhibit VEGF production. Here, we show that <b>flavopiridol</b> treatment of human U 87 MG and T 98 G glioma cell lines decreases hypoxia-mediated HIF- 1 α expression, VEGF secretion, and tumor cell migration. These in vitro results correlate with reduced vascularity of intracranial syngeneic GL 261 gliomas from animals treated with <b>flavopiridol.</b> In addition, we show that <b>flavopiridol</b> downregulates HIF- 1 α expression {{in the presence of}} a proteasome inhibitor, an agent that normally results in the accumulation and overexpression of HIF- 1 α. The potential to downregulate HIF- 1 α expression with <b>flavopiridol</b> treatment in combination with a proteasome inhibitor makes this an extremely attractive anticancer treatment strategy for tumors with high angiogenic activity, such as gliomas...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{administration}} of <b>flavopiridol</b> in advanced-stage {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} (CLL) {{is often associated with}} early biochemical evidence of tumor cell lysis. Previous work using other cell types showed that <b>flavopiridol</b> impacts mitochondria, and in CLL cells <b>flavopiridol</b> down-regulates the mitochondrial protein Mcl- 1. We therefore investigated mitochondrial structure and function in flavopiridol-treated CLL patient cells and in the lymphoblastic cell line 697 using concentrations and times at which tumor lysis is observed in treated patients. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization was detected in flavopiridol-treated CLL cells by 6 hours, well before the onset of cell death. Flavopiridol-induced mitochondrial depolarization was not blocked by caspase inhibitors or by the calcium chelator EGTA, but was reduced by Bcl- 2 overexpression. Intracellular calcium mobilization was noted at early time points using fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, electron paramagnetic resonance oximetry showed a gradual but significant reduction in cellular oxygen consumption rate by 6 hours, corresponding with ultrastructural mitochondrial damage detected by electron microscopy. These observations suggest that in CLL and 697 cells, <b>flavopiridol</b> mediates its cytotoxic effects via induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition and changes in intracellular calcium...|$|E
40|$|Cancer cells {{appear to}} depend heavily on antiapoptotic {{proteins}} for survival and so targeted inhibition of these proteins has therapeutic potential. One innovative {{strategy is to}} inhibit the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) responsible for the regulation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). In our study, we investigated the detailed cellular mechanism of a novel small-molecule CDK inhibitor (CDKI- 71) in cancer cell lines, primary leukemia cells, normal B - & T- cells, and embryonic lung fibroblasts and compared the cellular and molecular responses to the clinical CDK inhibitor, <b>flavopiridol.</b> Like <b>flavopiridol,</b> CDKI- 71 displayed potent cytotoxicity and caspase-dependent apoptosis induction that were {{closely associated with the}} inhibition of RNAPII phosphorylation at serine- 2. This was caused by effective targeting of cyclinT–CDK 9 and resulted in the downstream inhibition of Mcl- 1. No correlation between apoptosis and inhibition of cell-cycle CDKs 1 and 2 was observed. CDKI- 71 showed a 10 -fold increase in potency in tumor cell lines when compared to MRC- 5 human fibroblast cells. Significantly, CDKI- 71 also demonstrated potent anti-chronic lymphocytic leukemia activity with minimal toxicity in normal B- and T-cells. In contrast, <b>flavopiridol</b> showed little selectivity between cancer and normal cells. Here, we provide the first cell-based evidence that <b>flavopiridol</b> induces DNA double-strand breaks: a fact which may explain why <b>flavopiridol</b> has such a narrow therapeutic window in preclinical and clinical settings. Taken together, our data provide a rationale for the development of selective CDK inhibitors as therapeutic agents and CDKI- 71 represents a promising lead in this context...|$|E
