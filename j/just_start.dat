500|$|Very {{little of}} the design from Freelance Police was carried over into Save the World; LucasArts still held onto the assets created for use in Freelance Police, and Telltale was wary of using similar design patterns. While Ferguson and Purcell had both been {{involved}} with the canceled LucasArts project, Grossman had not. The team decided to <b>just</b> <b>start</b> from fresh, and pursue a different treatment of the game's subject. Purcell himself wanted to ensure that the game conveyed the [...] "gritty" [...] feel of the original comics—something he felt was lacking from the LucasArts renditions of the franchise. Grossman stated that [...] "we wanted {{to get a little bit}} more of that dirt on the streets, and the paper cups and people being mean and nasty". This [...] "gritty" [...] feeling also influenced artistic design. For instance, on Purcell's suggestion, the sky was changed from blue to yellow in the street outside Sam and Max's office, instantly making the environment feel [...] "filthy and disgusting".|$|E
500|$|Killer7 {{received}} divisive {{reviews and}} sparked debates about depictions {{of sex and}} violence in video games {{and the status of}} video games as art. James Mielke of 1UP.com likened the game's high-contrast art style to noir and neo-noir film such as Se7en. He found that despite poor pacing and stilted gameplay, the [...] "quirky scripting and edgy plot" [...] were strong draws, and called Killer7 one of [...] "most artfully designed footnotes in gaming history". Edge magazine's reviewers echoed this sentiment and predicted that the game would [...] " [...] for future creative leeway", crediting the director with an unwavering artistic vision. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed was keenly aware of the game's limited appeal, calling it [...] "a concept game, an arthouse game, a simple game, an often beautiful game, but most certainly never an everyman's game". Yahtzee Croshaw of The Escapist commends the game for [...] "showing exactly what can be done when you flaunt all established convention and <b>just</b> <b>start</b> exploring what can really be done with gaming as an art form".|$|E

The {{production}} was handled by Timberlake, Beyoncé, Dean, Jordy [...] "Boots" [...] Asher as well as Mosley, Harmon and Wane under their stage names Timbaland, J-Roc and Key Wane respectively. [...] "Partition" [...] was conceived as a two-part song, {{the first part of}} which is called [...] "Yoncé". The latter's original drumbeat was created by Timberlake on a bucket. Mike Dean then added the dropping 808's lead synths, claps and strings. Beyoncé described the sound that he created as [...] "organic" [...] and said, [...] "It reminded me of being in middle school during the lunch breaks, when you <b>just</b> <b>start</b> free-styling." [...] The trio decided to keep the buckets as Beyoncé wanted an organic production. Then The-Dream started writing some of the lyrics including, [...] "Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor". Beyoncé found it awkward at the beginning but she soon loved the phrase, which lead to the birth of her new alter ego, Yoncé. The singer revealed that she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] after she recorded [...] "Partition" [...] because of its overtly sexual lyrics. Speaking about how {{the other part of the}} song materialized, Beyoncé said: ...|$|E
500|$|Early in {{the writing}} process, Donegan created guitar riffs. The rest of the band then listened to the riffs, and wrote {{the rest of the}} music, with the riffs being the base. As Donegan commented, [...] "The writing process is... pretty much the same since the beginning... of this band. It's always been riffs; {{something}} musically that I'll come up with [...]" [...] Wengren commented, [...] "We're always tossing around riffs and beats, but it isn't really until we get home and we are able to clear our minds, decompress for a little bit, and then hit it, especially Danny and I, and <b>just</b> <b>start</b> throwing the riffs and the beats out, that the music starts to finally come to life." [...] Bassist John Moyer left the studio during the recording process, due to his wife being pregnant. Donegan and Wengren sent him demos through e-mail, and he continued to write bass lines for the songs from his home studio. Regarding electronics on the album, Donegan said, [...] "When the basic guitar, bass, [...] drums were being laid down, at first I didn't really see a whole lot of room for some of the electronics, but as the songs were starting to develop, I was just in that frame of mind to try and toy around with some of the electronics." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of the album's {{songs were}} {{recorded}} by Saadiq with his live band, which included drummer Lemar Carter, bassist Calvin Turner, and guitarist Rob Bacon. Bacon, {{who had played}} with Saadiq since 2002, said of their grittier approach to guitar, [...] "I have relative pitch, as opposed to perfect pitch, so there'd be times when I'd spend 15 or 20 minutes tuning my instrument. Then he'd come in and pick up his guitar and <b>just</b> <b>start</b> playing it however it was left the day before. On one of the tracks I had to play over all this stuff {{that was out of}} tune. Raphael was like, 'That's what makes it funky!'". Musical guests such as vocalist Yukimi Nagano, keyboardist Larry Dunn, bass player Larry Graham, keyboardist Amp Fiddler, and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph also contributed to the album's recording sessions, with Saadiq selecting their parts for certain tracks. The song [...] "Go to Hell" [...] was conceived from one of Amp Fiddler's Mellotron ideas. Saadiq recorded a duet with Graham called [...] "The Perfect Storm", included as a hidden track on the album: [...] "I played bass, but I put my bass down [...] The first day I tried to play bass for him, I couldn't even play. I froze three times. He's my all-time idol!".|$|E

500|$|... "Rockstar 101" [...] {{received}} mixed {{responses from}} music critics. Brian Linder for IGN praised the song, writing that it [...] "actually works" [...] despite sounding disjointed at first. Emily Tartanella of PopMatters defined [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] as a [...] "brilliant bit of bravado" [...] during her review of Rated R, while Ailbhe Malone for NME wrote that Rihanna sings with [...] "swagger" [...] on the track, which {{was something that}} she has Hova to thank for. Jon Pareles for The New York Times simply highlighted {{a line from the}} song, [...] "I never play the victim". Neil McCormick for The Daily Telegraph thought that [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] {{was one of the few}} songs on the album to retain the [...] "vaguest leftover hints of her warm Caribbean vocal flavouring". Ann Powers for the Los Angeles Times was critical of Slash's inclusion on the song, and she described it as an [...] "afterthought". Powers wrote [...] "she can definitely get by without that ultimate rock phallic symbol", a reference to Slash. Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombell felt that [...] "Rockstar 101, alike [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "The Last Song", were [...] "instantly-dated missteps from a bygone era when a Slash feature was cool". He further wrote that [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] and [...] "G4L" [...] were [...] "harder to justify considering their mindless boasts and torpid production". The song was met with a negative review from The Guardians Alex Petridis, who wrote [...] "At one extreme, the resemblance of 'Umbrella's chorus to that of a stadium rock ballad seems to have encouraged Rihanna to cut out the middle-man and <b>just</b> <b>start</b> making stadium rock: cue the awful widdly-woo guitars of 'Rockstar 101' and 'Fire Bomb.|$|E

[...] In 1994, the band began a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster, which lasted for three years and limited the band's ability to tour in the United States. During the mid-1990s, Vedder faced what he called a [...] "pretty intense stalker problem".Vedder would refer to the issue in the song [...] "Lukin" [...] from No Code.|$|E
