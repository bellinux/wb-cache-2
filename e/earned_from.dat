5|$|In total, 757,813,744 dollars dated 1979 {{were struck}} for {{circulation}} at the Philadelphia, Denver and San Francisco Mints.

Due to its persistent unpopularity, production of Anthony dollars for circulation was suspended, and 9,742,000 1981 dollars were struck across all three Mints exclusively for sale to collectors; this mintage {{marked the end of}} production. At the close of production, the Treasury encountered a dilemma: the Mint struck a large number of dollars in anticipation of great public demand, resulting in a surplus of 520,000,000 coins in 1981. Melting the coins was impractical; the cost of manufacture was approximately 2 cents, and the 98 cents <b>earned</b> <b>from</b> seignorage was applied to the national debt. Had the coins been melted, their seignorage would {{have been added to the}} debt. Accordingly, the coins were placed in government storage, to be dispensed as needed.|$|E
