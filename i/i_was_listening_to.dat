25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light {{classical}} guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

[...] "Something that 20 or 30 years from now, parents could play for their kids and say, 'This is what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> when I was your age. Check it out, it’s still fucking cool.' We {{wanted to make a}} record you could pass down. There’s a lot of music out now that doesn’t feel like that." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> {{the radio}} and heard 'Genius of Love', and I hadn't heard it in a long time. It {{reminded}} me of growing up and listening to {{the radio and}} that feeling the song gave me seemed to go with the melody and basic idea I had for [...] "Fantasy." [...] I initially told Dave about the idea, and we did it. We called up the Tom Tom Club and they were really into it.|$|E

500|$|The album {{features}} vocal appearances by Timberlake, Timbaland, Pharrell Williams and Kanye West. It features {{production by}} Madonna, Timbaland, Timberlake, The Neptunes and Nate [...] "Danja" [...] Hills. Previously, Madonna {{had worked with}} relatively unknown producers like William Orbit, Mirwais Ahmadzaï and Stuart Price. However, for Hard Candy Madonna decided to collaborate with producers and artists who were already well-known. Talking to MTV, Madonna explained her decision to collaborate with well-known producers: [...] "Because they're good, and I like their shit. [...] I mean, I don't like to repeat myself, and I was sitting around thinking, 'What music do I love right now?' And it was actually [...] record FutureSex/LoveSounds. [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> it obsessively." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We had {{the song}} pitched {{to us and}} {{originally}} it wasn’t a duet. The more <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the thing and learning the song, I realized it set itself {{up to be a}} duet if we wanted to go that route. When I called my producer about it he asked who I wanted to sing it with me and I said Kelly Clarkson, but I didn’t think we’d be able to get her. I’ve always been a big fan of hers. I love her voice and I love her style. Long story short, we got her a copy of the song and she loved it. As soon as she started singing, it became obvious {{it was going to be}} great." ...|$|E
500|$|Harvey {{has said}} of her time with Automatic Dlamini: [...] "I ended up not singing very much but I was just happy {{to learn how to}} play the guitar. I wrote a lot during the time I was with them but my first songs were crap. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> a lot of Irish folk music at the time, so the songs were folky and full of penny {{whistles}} and stuff. It was ages before I felt ready to perform my own songs in front of other people." [...] She also credits Parish for teaching her how to perform in front of audiences, saying [...] "after the experience with John's band and seeing him perform I found it was enormously helpful to me as a performer to engage with people in the audience, and I probably did learn that from him, amongst other things." ...|$|E

25|$|Erasmus said of Colet, “When I <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> Colet {{it seems}} <b>to</b> me that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> Plato himself.” Erasmus likely portrayed Colet {{to show that}} one could be highly {{critical}} of the Church while still a loyal priest. His depiction of Colet was partly a depiction of himself.|$|R
6000|$|... --If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> your {{esthetic}} philosophy give me {{at least}} another cigarette. I don't care about it. I don't even care about women. Damn you and damn everything. I want a job of five hundred a year. You can't get me one.|$|R
500|$|The other {{material}} on Eat a Peach comes from live recordings. Dowd later said, [...] "When we recorded At Fillmore East, {{we ended up}} with almost a whole other album's worth of good material, and we used [...] tracks on Eat a Peach. Again, there was no overdubbing". Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's {{not going to be any}} more from him". He was particularly proud of his mixing work on the album, but was angry because he did not receive credit, only a [...] "special thanks." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock and rap rock by professional reviewers. Shinoda described the album's sound as a 1990s style of rock record: [...] "It's a Rock record; [...] "it's loud and it's Rock, but not in the sense of what you've heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk–thrash". He described the [...] "weak" [...] status of modern rock in the music industry as an inspiration in recording a heavier rock album; to try to bring the sound of the 1990s back to the forefront. Shinoda criticized the modern state of alternative radio, stating [...] "There’s so much stuff that sounds like HAIM or CHVRCHES or Vampire Weekend that I’m full. The thing I’m hungry for is not that. I turn on the rock station in L.A. and it sounds like Disney commercial music.” This led to a response from CHVRCHES, with their lead singer Lauren Mayberry calling Shinoda's comment [...] "a pointless dig." [...] Bennington agreed with Shinoda's comments, as he said, [...] "The bands <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> when I was growing up were all doing really innovative shit—Jane’s Addiction, Alice in Chains, Nirvana... Bands like the Refreshments and the Rembrandts, that music fucking angers me to this day. And the same thing is happening now, where there’s all this stuff that feels like the soundtrack to 'Friends' or 'The Wizards of Waverly Place.'” ...|$|E
2500|$|Punk band Dropkick Murphys {{covered the}} song for their 2017 album 11 Short Stories of Pain & Glory. Vocalist/bassist Ken Casey {{said in a}} December 2016 {{interview}} discussing the reason behind their version. [...] "As you may know, opiate overdoses are an epidemic in America now particularly in (the Boston) area. I've been to thirty wakes in two years, three this week, one being my cousin, Al's lost a brother in law. It's hit home close to us. I was leaving one of the wakes and this song came on and as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the lyrics it summed up exactly how I was feeling. Sad, but knowing there is hope. You never have to be alone. I hope you our version".|$|E
5000|$|The song {{received}} many positive reviews; Entertainment Weekly said about Lambert [...] "She's not Priscilla. She's Elvis."

2500|$|In 2005, Phoenix {{starred in}} the James Mangold {{directed}} film Walk the Line, a Johnny Cash biopic, after Cash himself approved of Phoenix. All of Cash's vocal tracks in the film and on the accompanying soundtrack are played and sung by Phoenix. The film was released on November 18, 2005, eventually grossing $186 million. Phoenix's performance received rave reviews from critics and it inspired film critic Roger Ebert to write, [...] "Knowing Johnny Cash's albums more or less by heart, I closed my eyes {{to focus on the}} soundtrack and decided that, yes, that was the voice of Johnny Cash <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to.</b> The closing credits make it clear it's Joaquin Phoenix doing the singing, and I was gob-smacked". For his portrayal of [...] Johnny Cash, Phoenix was nominated for his second Academy Award, in the category of Best Actor as well as the BAFTA Award for Best Actor, Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role. He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media for the film's soundtrack. Earlier that year, he narrated Earthlings (2005), a documentary about the investigation of animal abuse in factory farms, pet mills and for scientific research. He was awarded the Humanitarian Award at the San Diego Film Festival in 2005, for his work and contribution to Earthlings.|$|E
