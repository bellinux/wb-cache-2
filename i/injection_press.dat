40|$|Nowadays most {{industries}} do not integrate product, {{process and}} energy data. Costs due to energy consumption are often considered externalities and energy efficiency is not deemed a relevant performance criterion. In energy-intensive processes, as injection moulding, the specific energy consumption, embedded inside the same products, {{depends on the}} machine–product combinations. Multi-objective scheduling, including the energy data acquired from shop floor and allocation criteria, is a valuable approach to improve energy efficiency. This paper presents the extension of a commercial detailed scheduling support system developed within a regional Italian project aiming at providing tools to manufacturing industry for improving energy efficiency. The project designed a monitoring system developed by instrumenting <b>injection</b> moulding <b>presses</b> to acquire the energy consumption for each product–machine combination. The commercial scheduling system was extended by implementing a multi-objective metaheuristic scheduling approach. The experimental assessment of the proposed approach involved a major producer of plastic dispensers. The extended algorithm simultaneously optimizes the total weighted tardiness, the total setup and the energy consumption costs. The obtained results, produced for a real test case {{and a set of}} random generated instances, show the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} CO 2 laser incising under five drying methods on drying characteristics of Sugi lumber, the squares (120  mm ×  120  mm) of Sugi lumber with length of 650  mm were used. A half of samples were incised by CO 2 laser with incising density of 2, 500  holes/m 2. Five types of drying methods were used: microwave drying, steam injection drying, and three combinations of microwave heating and steam injection drying. Steam injection drying was conducted by injecting superheated steam of 120  °C through a perforated plate heated to 140  °C of an <b>injection</b> <b>press.</b> Microwave was irradiated {{with the power of}} 3  kW at frequency of 2.45  GHz. The results indicated that incising helps heat through a specimen and thus the whole temperature raised rapidly, which was up to threefolds compared to that of no-incised one. Incised specimens dried by a combination of microwave heating for 1  h and steam injection showed the highest drying rate, which was up to 5.3  %/h. Incising and microwave heating contributed positively to dry lumber under more uniform distribution of moisture content and to reduce surface and internal checks. Incised specimen dried by microwave showed the most uniform distribution of moisture content without surface and internal checks.|$|E

Those were the following: (1) steam injections drying, (2) microwave drying, (3) combination of microwave heating up to 100  °C and steam injection drying, (4) combination of microwave heating for 1  h and steam injection drying, and (5) combination of microwave heating for 2  h and steam injection drying. Two specimens {{were used for}} each drying method. Steam injection drying was conducted by injecting superheated steam of 120  °C through the perforated plate of 140  °C with steam <b>injection</b> <b>press</b> (Kitagawa Seiki Co. Ltd; VH 2 - 1449). Pressure of the inside chamber was kept at 50  kPa above atmospheric pressure. Specimens were tightly stacked without sticker or mesh to reduce steam leaking.

Temperature and pressures were recorded by the sensors inserted in the centre point of the specimens, at an interval of 10  s. Pressure in a specimen {{was measured by the}} transducers connected to data logger through a stainless steel tube whose inside diameter is 0.5  mm.

40|$|International audienceShear and extensional {{properties}} {{of a commercial}} short glass fiber reinforced polypropylene were carefully investigated using commercial rheometers and a novel on-line rheometer. This on-line slit rheometer, installed on an <b>injection</b> molding <b>press,</b> {{has been designed to}} measure the steady shear viscosity, the first normal stress difference, and the apparent extensional viscosity of polymer melts and composites for high strain rates up to 10 (5) s(- 1) in shear and 200 s(- 1) in extension. Our results show that the steady-state viscosity measurements using the on-line rheometer are in excellent agreement with those obtained using commercial rheometers. The steady-state and the complex viscosities of the composites were found to be fairly close to that of the matrix, but the Cox-Merz rule was not verified for the composites at high rates. The elasticity of the composites was found to be equal to that of the polypropylene matrix. The apparent extensional viscosity was obtained from the pressure drop in the planar converging die of the slit rheometer using the analyses proposed by Cogswell [1] and Binding [2]. The extensional viscosity of the polypropylene was found to be much larger than the shear viscosity at low strain rates with a Trouton ratio of about 40 that decreased rapidly with increasing strain rate down to the value of 4 at 200 s(- 1). The extensional viscosity of the composites was also found to be close to that of the matrix, with values 35 and 5 % larger for the 30 and 10 wt% reinforced polypropylenes, respectively.

40|$|The Using of {{lightweight}} structures {{is a big}} {{trend for}} reducing fuel consumption and CO² emissions especially in the transport sector. Metal plastic hybrid structures are an efficient solution to use the best material at every place. The current states of the art for the manufacturing of metal plastic composites are three technologies: the insert technology, the outsert technology and the metal plastic hybrid technology. In all technologies the metal parts were produced separately from the plastic parts. The injection moulding process is only used for forming the plastic parts and for joining. This process chains are very long. At the Fraunhofer IWU new process combinations are under development. The aim {{is a combination of}} metal forming and injection moulding in one die and one process. One part should be produced with every stroke of the press. In a first step deep drawing, injection molding and media based forming with the plastic melt have been successfully merged in one tool and one process. It was possible to integrate the injection moulding process in a deep drawing machine. In the next step hydroforming with gas and injection molding could be combined successfully. For this process combination the hydroforming process is integrated in an <b>injection</b> moulding <b>press.</b> Different surface structures of the metal pipes, such as sandblasting, knurling and laser structuring, were systematically tested regarding to their properties as an adhesion promoter. The goal is to establish a purely mechanical connection between the hydroformed metal component and the injection moulded component from glass fibre reinforced plastic instead of the previously often used chemical bonding agents, such as Vestamelt.

Beside the implementation of lightweight materials such as Ultra-High Strength Steel, Aluminum, Magnesium or Fiber Reinforced Polymers there is an upcoming request of Hybrid Materials. Metal Plastic Hybrid Structures are an efficient solution to use the right material at the right place in design space. State of the art regarding production technologies for hybrid structures is that metal components are produced separately in conventional forming processes. These parts are engaged in the molding die and the core injection molding process is only responsible for shaping plastic ingredient and joining. Such process chains are complex and extensive. The paper shows a new approach of the process combination of conventionally metal forming technologies and the {{application of}} the fluid plastic from molding process as a forming media in the meaning of hydroforming. By this the aim is a process combination of metal forming and injection molding in one die and one process step to produce high complex hybrid metal-plastic components in an high efficient way.

By this the plastic melt is also used as forming media in the meaning of hyfroforming and it was successfully merged in one tool and one process. The second development step increased the complexity to a combination of gas forming and an injection molding for tubes and closed profiles.
