30|$|Desander hydrocyclones {{are used}} to provide {{reliable}} and efficient separation of sand and solid particles from water, condensate flows, and gas streams. They {{have proven to be}} a valuable part of many oil and gas production facilities in the petroleum industry. The desander cyclones are pressure-driven separators that require a pressure drop across the unit to cause separation of the solids from the bulk phase (water, oil, gas, etc.). It is typical to collect the solids in a closed underflow container or vessel, and periodically dump these solids. <b>Desanded</b> water/oil/gas in the central core section reverses direction and is forced out through the central vortex finder towards the overflow {{at the top of the}} cyclone (Process Group Pty Ltd. 2012).|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental engineeringThe {{production}} of petroleum resources includes co-producing water. This water contains oil products {{and needs to}} be treated before discharge to sea or re-injection into the reservoir. The amount of produced water increases with the age of a field, as does often the amount of solids. The pressure of the reservoirs will decrease with time. The primary equipment for treating produced water is the hydro cyclone. It’s operated with a lower limit with regards to oil droplet size of ~ 10 μm although smaller oil droplets have been experienced to separate. The hydro cyclone requires a certain differential pressure to perform at its maximum efficiency, and it is sensitive to solids. To protect the hydro cyclone a <b>desanding</b> cyclone could be installed upstream the hydro cyclone. A pump is often used to pressurize the water if necessary. The effect that this equipment has on the oil-water separation is a topic being discussed in the industry. The development in the industry, with increasing the life lengths of the fields and the need for development in areas of more stringent requirements, will benefit more knowledge regarding the effect of pumps and <b>desanding</b> cyclones on the oil- water separation. This thesis deals with these issues and presents the knowledge that exists with regards to pumps and <b>desanding</b> cyclones and their effect on oil droplet coalescence and break-up. This research has been done through contacts with suppliers, literature studies and evaluation of available test data related to this equipment. The literature survey and contacts with pump suppliers reveal that little work has been done to identify any effect of the pumps on the oil droplets. Both the literature survey and the suppliers agree that the eccentric screw pump generates the least droplet break-up, and that the centrifugal pump creates more shearing than other pump types. The offshore tests of centrifugal pumps and twin screw pumps indicate that the twin screw pump is gentler to the oil droplets than the centrifugal pump. While the tests of the centrifugal pumps indicate that increasing differential pressure increases droplet break-up, the twin screw pumps do not show such correlation. This indicates that the twin screw pump is more suitable, with regards to oil droplet sizes, for boosting the produced water to a hydro cyclone. The literature survey and the contacts with the <b>desanding</b> cyclone suppliers reveal that little work has been done to identify any effect of the <b>desanding</b> cyclone on the oil droplets. The experience of the suppliers is that the <b>desanding</b> cyclone gives coalescence, while the one revealed test show that the <b>desanding</b> cyclone isn’t damaging to the downstream separation. The offshore tests indicate that the <b>desanding</b> cyclone create coalescence or an insignificantly degree of break up and will not damage the oil removal performance of the downstream equipment...|$|R
50|$|Sedimentation is a {{major issue}} for Sungai Bertam and Sungai Telom due to {{uncontrolled}} clearing of land. A check dam has been constructed upstream of the main reservoir on Sungai Bertam. The check dam is able {{to reduce the amount}} of sediment entering the reservoir and prolonging the reservoir life. A <b>desanding</b> system has been constructed at the intake of Sungai Telom for the same purpose.|$|R
50|$|Raw {{starch milk}} is {{purified}} in the refining process. This involves {{the removal of}} small fibers from the starch milk and then the removal of juice water and starch milk condensation. For this purpose, the screens and hydrocyclones are commonly used. Hydrocyclones due to the low output (approximately 0.3 cubic meter per hour) are connected in parallel and works as multihydrocyclones. For the starch milk <b>desanding</b> bihydrocyclones are used. In order to prevent enzymatic darkening of potato juice the chemical refining of starch is carried out using sulfurous acid. Refined starch milk has a density of about 22° Be, which is about 38% of starch.|$|R
50|$|Fortescue’s first minesite Cloudbreak {{currently}} mines 40 {{million tonnes}} of iron ore a year. The horizontal {{nature of the}} deposits at Cloudbreak called for a new mining approach to those used at other mines which operate on vertical deposits of ore. Overburden removal is done using conventional blast, truck and shovel methods while specially designed surface miners cut and load the ore into trucks for transport to the run of mine stockpiles.Screening, crushing and <b>desand</b> plants at the Cloudbreak ore processing facility prepare and refine the product before the ore is stockpiled ahead of transport to port. The train loadout facility at Cloudbreak is capable of feeding 16,000 tonnes of ore per hour on the 2.7 kilometre long trains ready for the journey along the 256 kilometre heavy haul railway to the facilities at Herb Elliott Port.|$|R
40|$|Chevron (formerly Unocal) Thailand {{has been}} {{producing}} {{natural gas and}} crude oil in the Gulf of Thailand since 1981. Co-produced water is contaminated with hydrocarbons, mercury and arsenic. Where feasible, Unocal Thailand pursued a philosophy which entails re-injecting produced water back into the rock formations from whence it originated. Currently, over 50, 000 bwpd are injected in two fields in legacy Unocal’s contract area. Re-injection of all produced water is projected to be implemented by year-end 2007. Overboard discharge limits for produced water are 40 mg/L TPH, 10 ppb Hg and 250 ppb As. Characterization of the produced water has shown that hydrocarbons are present as stabilized emulsions, mercury is primarily present in the elemental form, Hg, and arsenic is present as As 3 +. A patented process was developed several years ago to remove these contaminants from produced water prior to overboard discharge. The process consists of a three-phase separator to remove gas and condensate. Water leaves {{the bottom of the}} separator and passes through <b>desanding</b> and deoiling hydrocyclones. The water then enters the chemical treatment process. In the chemical treatment process, an oxidant (NaOCl), ferric ions and a flocculent are sequentially added to the wastewater t...|$|R
40|$|Many {{developing}} countries do {{not focus on}} land use planning in hydropower development. As a result hydropower projects are not sustainable. The aim {{of the study is}} to analyze the cause and effects of land use planning in hydropower development. The primary and secondary data were collected in a case study site at the Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project (UTHEP) in Dolakha district of Nepal. Household questionnaire, key informants ‟ interviews and field observation were conducted to collect primary data while the relevant documents such as detailed feasibility report, property valuation report and spatial data (cadastral data, image etc.) were also collected for the study. The primary and secondary data reveals that Land use changes involved in the UTHEP implementation is basically due to the permanent and temporary land acquisition for project structures, facilities and reservoir area. The total land acquired for various project components like access road, powerhouse, <b>desanding</b> basin, reservoir as well as construction borrow pits and quarries, temporary and permanent work camps and construction of access road is estimated to be 182 ha. The secondary data reveals that 66 ha are allocated in agricultural land, 78 ha in forest land and 38 ha in the barren and cliff land. The results from secondary data and interviews confirm that UTHEP has planned to distribute 10 % share to the residents of Dolakha district to promote local level investment. Finally, the study finds that land use plannin...|$|R
40|$|The liquid {{carried by}} the {{combined}} drain system mainly contains water, heavy liquid hydrocarbons and mixed light end hydrocarbon gas (VOC) /Acid Gas (e. g. H 2 S mixture). The liquid was routed to a small horizontal pressure vessel to flash-off trapped gas and carryover oil is skimmed in an open sump downstream of the vessel. Increased flow rate to the close drain flash system has decreased the retention time and thus results in adequate flashing of lighter hydrocarbons and acid gas from the closed drain influent coming into the old vessel. This has created a potential environment and safety hazard for the people working around that vessel when the flashing of residual hydrocarbon and acid gas occurs in the sump, which is open to atmosphere. The mitigation of the problem involved designing a large horizontal tank with a heating coil and oil separation chamber, which can provide adequate retention time for the VOC/acid gas to flash off from the influent liquid. The oil chamber will collect hydrocarbon-oil after the de-emulsification process. Mechanical agitation, by using the <b>desanding</b> nozzle, prevents accumulation of sand {{at the bottom of}} the vessel. The project aims at the prevention of the carryover oil with outlet water into the biological process reactor downstream of the new tank. The accumulated oil is analyzed. The oil sample contains species similar to light crude oil. Economic analysis is performed to estimate the revenue obtained from the disposal of spent oil to a third party carrier...|$|R
40|$|Identified as an {{important}} issue for marginal fields, the removal of sand from hydrocarbon fluids has been investigated. A review of existing sand separation equipment has recognized {{a need for a}} new separator which will satisfy the design and performance requirements necessary for protecting offshore processing equipment. This thesis details the work and analysis undertaken which has contributed towards the design and development of a new offshore gas/solid separator. A critique of different separation techniques has identified axial flow cyclone (AFC) separators as a suitable separator design for offshore <b>desanding</b> applications. After reviewing existing models which simulate the performance of AFC separators a simple classification table has been developed. Using the conclusions of this review as a starting platform, a methodology for developing a new computational fluid dynamics (CFD) performance model for the new separator was proposed. Experimental work undertaken at the CALtec laboratories and the BG plc (formerly British Gas Research and Technology) Low Thornley test facilities are presented. The results obtained have been used to analysis the performance of difference separator internal designs. In addition, the results have been used to evaluate the robustness of existing AFC performance models and validate the new CFD model. For the investigated operational duties, the new CFD model has been shown to consistently under-predict the collection efficiency, whereas the other AFC models over-predict. From a design point of view, a model which under-predicts the overall collection efficiency will result in the over-design of the separator for a particular operating duty. Therefore, the use of such a model will ensure the design of a separator which will offer greater than expected levels of protection of downstream equipment from erosion wear...|$|R
50|$|Under {{orders from}} Major Ullube Ishikawa, Domon and his {{childhood}} friend and mechanic Rain Mikamura travel {{from country to}} country, challenging each one's Gundam while searching for clues to the whereabouts of Kyoji and the Dark Gundam. Domon's initial matches with Neo America's Chibodee Crocket, Neo France's George <b>DeSand,</b> Neo China's Sai Sai Ci, and Neo Russia's Argo Gulskii end in draws, gaining mutual respect among the fighters. As they encounter Gundam pilots who had {{come in contact with}} the Dark Gundam, Domon and Rain learn of its unique cellular properties to regenerate, multiply, and evolve by infecting organic matter and causing violent behavior in living things. The duo then journey to Neo Tokyo, a city decimated by the Dark Gundam's army of mobile weapons. Domon reunites with his esteemed martial arts instructor Master Asia, who is also the champion of the last Gundam Fight, the former King of Hearts, and one-time leader of an elite group of Gundam fighters called the Shuffle Alliance. After Domon and Rain help the city's survivors defend their last outpost in Shinjuku, Master Asia reveals himself as a servant of the Dark Gundam, having also gained control over Chibodee, George, Sai Sai Ci, and Argo using Dark Gundam (DG) cells. The four remaining members of the Shuffle Alliance intervene and vow to destroy their previous leader for his crimes. Ultimately, the Alliance members offer their lives in purging the DG cells from Domon's four comrades and bestow each of them with a Shuffle Alliance crest as their successors. Kyoji and the enormous Dark Gundam eventually appear from beneath the ground of Shinjuku, but shortly thereafter vanish alongside Master Asia. As the Shuffle Alliance trains in the Guiana Highlands for the Gundam Fight finals, Master Asia and the Dark Gundam reappear. With the help of his friends and a new ally in Neo Germany's masked warrior Schwarz Bruder, Domon defeats the Dark Gundam. When the Shining Gundam becomes incapacitated during the battle, Domon desperately manages to activate a newly acquired Burning Gundam, escape Master Asia, and make his way to the finals set in Neo Hong Kong.|$|R
