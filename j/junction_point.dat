5|$|Holliday {{junctions}} with a nick, {{or break}} {{in one of}} the strands, at the <b>junction</b> <b>point</b> adopt a perpendicular orientation, and always prefer the stacking conformer that places the nick on a crossover strand rather than a helical strand.|$|E
5|$|The two {{possible}} stacked forms differ in which pairs {{of the arms}} are stacked with each other; {{which of the two}} dominates is highly dependent on the base sequences nearest to the junction. Some sequences result in an equilibrium between the two conformers, while others strongly prefer a single conformer. In particular, junctions containing the sequence A-CC bridging the <b>junction</b> <b>point</b> appear to strongly prefer the conformer that allows a hydrogen bond to form between the second cytosine and one of the phosphates at the <b>junction</b> <b>point.</b> While most studies have focused on the identities of the four bases nearest to the junction on each arm, it is evident that bases farther out can also affect the observed stacking conformations.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{algorithm}} for constructing contours from image data {{by means of}} a G 1 conic A-spline is presented. A conic A-spline is a piecewise smooth chain of connected real quadratic algebraic curves meeting G 1 at the <b>junction</b> <b>points.</b> Once the contour of the image data has been extracted, the algorithm computes the breakpoints of the conic A-spline, i. e the <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> for the conic curves make up the curve. Inflection points are also added to the set of <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> of the A-spline. Tangent lines at the <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> are computed using a weighted least square linear fit instead of the classical divided difference techniques. The conic A-spline interpolates the <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> along with the tangent directions and least-squares approximates the given data between <b>junction</b> <b>points.</b> We discuss and compare our experience with the approaches reported in the recent literature. Additionally, we propose some improvements.

5|$|Development of System Shock 2 {{began in}} 1997 when Looking Glass Studios {{approached}} Irrational Games {{with an idea}} to co-develop a new game. The development team were fans of System Shock and sought to create a similar game. Early story ideas were similar to the novella Heart of Darkness. In an early draft, the player was tasked with assassinating an insane commander on a starship. The original title of the game, according to its pitch document, was <b>Junction</b> <b>Point.</b> The philosophy of the design was to continue to develop {{the concept of a}} dungeon crawler, like , in a science fiction setting, the basis for System Shock. However, the press mistook System Shock to be closer to a Doom clone which was cited for poor financial success of System Shock. With <b>Junction</b> <b>Point,</b> the goal was to add in significant role-playing elements and a persistent storyline as to distance the game from Doom.|$|E
5|$|Reading {{is a major}} <b>junction</b> <b>point</b> of the National Rail system, {{and hence}} Reading station is a major {{transfer}} point and terminus. In a project that finished in 2015, Reading station was redeveloped {{at a cost of}} £850m, with grade separation of some conflicting traffic flows, and extra platforms, to relieve severe congestion at this station. Railway lines link Reading to both Paddington and Waterloo stations in London. Other stations in the Reading area are Reading West, Tilehurst and Earley. Green Park railway station is planned on the Reading to Basingstoke Line to serve Green Park Business Park.|$|E
5|$|The Holliday {{junctions}} in {{homologous recombination}} are between identical or nearly identical sequences, {{leading to a}} symmetric arrangement of sequences around the central junction. This allows a branch migration process to occur where the strands move through the <b>junction</b> <b>point.</b> Cleavage, or resolution, of the Holliday junction can occur in two ways. Cleavage of the original set of strands leads to two molecules that may show gene conversion but not chromosomal crossover, while cleavage of the other set of two strands causes the resulting recombinant molecules to show crossover. All products, regardless of cleavage, are heteroduplexes {{in the region of}} Holliday junction migration.|$|E

5|$|Elstow first {{formed in}} the area known as Lakeview. Administrative affairs were handled from 1905 to 1909 by the Local Improvement District #17-A3 and then by rural {{municipality}} Blucher No. 343. The station of Fountain was on the rail line and Provincial Highway 14 in 1907. Lanigan received steel in 1907. Lanigan was a CPR <b>junction</b> <b>point</b> and five rail lines served the area from Lanigan, as well as Provincial highway 14 (the Yellowhead) and Hwy 20. Humboldt and Watson were served to the north, and Nokomis to the south {{as well as the}} main Saskatoon Winnipeg line. The rail came to Wynyard in 1909, and three years later the area incorporated as a town. Wynyard was the CPR divisional point.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, {{nationalism}} {{had been}} largely absent in officers of the Austro-Hungarian Army, but this changed during the war, {{and by the end}} of the war, the propaganda of the Entente had combined with wider aspirations to encourage nationalist sentiment. In some cases, this resulted in mutiny among units of the Austro-Hungarian Army in the last months of the war. The states that would succeed Austria-Hungary were approved by the Allies on 28 October 1918, and the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary was dissolved three days later. Many new nation states emerged in the territory formerly belonging to the realm, as nationalist movements called for greater autonomy or full independence. The Duchy of Styria was divided between the new states of German-Austria and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, but the exact line of the new border was unclear. In November 1918, Mikl had returned to his hometown of Radkersburg, an important railway <b>junction</b> <b>point,</b> which was of economic importance to both sides. The Slovenes occupied the city on 1 December 1918. In 1919, Mikl served as adjutant in the 1st Battalion of the Volkswehr militia, which used arms provided by the provincial government of Carinthia to make an unsuccessful attempt to recapture Radkersburg from forces of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to ensure it remained part of German-Austria. The provincial government of Styria, which had not supported these actions, subsequently issued a warrant ordering Mikl's arrest for treason. Despite his failure, his actions were very important in demonstrating to those negotiating the final border that towns along the northern bank of the Mura river were German. When the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye was signed later in 1919, Radkersburg was retained within what became the First Austrian Republic.|$|E

Construction took nearly 32 years, and the western part, from Stratford, was operated as the Toko Branch in 1902.

25|$|The main German thrust in {{the sector}} {{came at the}} <b>junction</b> <b>point</b> between the 5th Army and its {{neighbour}} to the south, the 6th Army, and both the 5th and 6th Armies committed their mechanised forces quickly to try to stem the gap, but without success. The Commander Southwestern Front, Mikhail Kirponos, decided to halt this with an attack into the flank of Panzer Group 1 using all the available mobile forces – five mechanised corps. This was unsuccessful {{in the face of}} the thrusting German advance, lack of coordination from the various Soviet formations, acute shortage of equipment and spares, and lack of proper equipment, especially radio sets. Meanwhile General M.I. Potapov, now commanding the 5th Army, was ordered on 29 June to make another attack on Panzer Group 1’s flank from the woods of Klevany. Amid these efforts, Kirponos managed to withdraw most of his Front to a new line almost on the old Soviet/Polish border, and prevented the Germans from rupturing the Soviet defensive line.|$|E
25|$|Support of UNIX-style {{symbolic}} links. Previous Windows versions had {{support for}} a type of cross-volume reparse points known as junction points and hard links. However, junction points could be created only for directories and stored absolute paths, whereas hardlinks could be created for files but were not cross-volume. NTFS symbolic links can be created for any object and are cross-volume, cross-host (work over UNC paths), and store relative paths. However, the cross-host functionality of symbolic links does not work over the network with previous versions of Windows or other operating systems, only with computers running Windows Vista or a later Windows operating system. Symbolic links can be created, modified and deleted using the Mklink utility which is included with Windows Vista. Microsoft has published some developer documentation on symbolic links in the MSDN documentation. In addition, Windows Explorer is now symbolic link-aware and deleting a symbolic link from Explorer just deletes the link itself and not the target object. Explorer also shows the symbolic link target in the object's properties and shows a shortcut icon overlay on a <b>junction</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

50|$|Geometrical {{models of}} nucleic acids {{are used to}} predict {{tertiary}} structure. This is important because designed nucleic acid complexes usually contain multiple <b>junction</b> <b>points,</b> which introduces geometric constraints to the system. These constraints stem from {{the basic structure of}} nucleic acids, mainly that the double helix formed by nucleic acid duplexes has a fixed helicity of about 10.4 base pairs per turn, and is relatively stiff. Because of these constraints, the nucleic acid complexes are sensitive to the relative orientation of the major and minor grooves at <b>junction</b> <b>points.</b> Geometrical modeling can detect strain stemming from misalignments in the structure, which can then be corrected by the designer.|$|R
500|$|After Looking Glass Technologies and Origin Systems {{released}} [...] in January 1993, producer Warren Spector {{began to}} plan Troubleshooter, {{the game that}} would become Deus Ex. Spector found himself burnt out on fantasy and science fiction settings and hoped to make a game set in the real world. In his 1994 proposal, he described the concept as [...] "Underworld-style first-person action" [...] in a real world setting with [...] "big-budget, nonstop action". Spector later commented that Origin {{did not have the}} interest, nor Looking Glass the funding, to produce the game. He eventually left Origin for Looking Glass and continued to develop the game's concept, but his project <b>Junction</b> <b>Point,</b> which was inspired by ideas from Troubleshooter, was canceled. After Spector and his team were laid off from Looking Glass, John Romero of Ion Storm offered him the chance to make his [...] "dream game" [...] without any restrictions. Spector quickly joined the company.|$|E
500|$|The {{complexes}} {{constructed in}} structural DNA nanotechnology use topologically branched nucleic acid structures containing junctions. (In contrast, most biological DNA exists as an unbranched double helix.) One {{of the simplest}} branched structures is a four-arm junction that consists of four individual DNA strands, portions of which are complementary in a specific pattern. Unlike in natural Holliday junctions, each arm in the artificial immobile four-arm junction has a different base sequence, causing the <b>junction</b> <b>point</b> to be fixed at a certain position. [...] Multiple junctions can be combined in the same complex, {{such as in the}} widely used double-crossover (DX) structural motif, which contains two parallel double helical domains with individual strands crossing between the domains at two crossover points. Each crossover point is, topologically, a four-arm junction, but is constrained to one orientation, in contrast to the flexible single four-arm junction, providing a rigidity that makes the DX motif suitable as a structural building block for larger DNA complexes.|$|E
500|$|In his 1994 {{proposal}} to Origin, {{he described the}} concept as [...] "Underworld-style first-person action" [...] in a real world setting with [...] "big-budget, nonstop action" [...] starring an ex-cop [...] "security specialist". He described the project as [...] "high" [...] risk for its [...] "technological unknowns" [...] as [...] "probably the toughest project on his wish list". It failed to get to production. He later left Origin for Looking Glass Technologies near {{the time that they}} were producing , but kept the idea in mind. For Thief, he tried to suggest buffing the character more so that the player could opt to fight through levels instead of sneaking, the original intent of the game, but the team didn't take to these ideas. He continued to change his character and game system plans for Troubleshooter, though the game he then called <b>Junction</b> <b>Point</b> did not reach production at Looking Glass. Spector wrote that the timing was not yet ripe because the business teams were not interested, the technology was not yet feasible, he did not have an interested team or the resources to make one, and that publishers did not want a [...] "first-person, cross-genre game". Spector, himself, was also tired of unrealistic fantasy and alien settings. Frustrated at Looking Glass, Spector sought employment elsewhere and was nearly about to sign a contract with Electronic Arts, when John Romero of Ion Storm approached him. When Romero offered him a chance to make his [...] "dream game" [...] without any restrictions, Spector was immediately on board.|$|E

The most common features on triangulated surfaces are ridges and valleys which are in-teresting for matching, segmentation, smooth-ing, non-photo-realistic rendering and many other tasks.

For this purpose a vector field on the surface, based on the detected features, is computed.
