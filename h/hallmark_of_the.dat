5|$|Militant {{action was}} not a <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{movements}} in Wales and Welsh members, who more often identified themselves as suffragists, sought Parliamentary and public support through political and peaceful means. In 1918, across the United Kingdom, women {{over the age of}} 30 gained the right to vote, followed by the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 which saw women gain the same rights to vote as men.|$|E
5|$|More broadly, one <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1950s was the {{beginning}} of European integration—a fundamental by-product of the Cold War that Truman and Eisenhower promoted politically, economically, and militarily, but which later administrations viewed ambivalently, fearful that an independent Europe would forge a separate détente with the Soviet Union, which would use this to exacerbate Western disunity.|$|E
5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the windows are all asymmetrical in nature, a <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arts and Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the Arts and Crafts movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E

5|$|Artificial ruins, {{built to}} {{resemble}} remnants of historic edifices, {{were also a}} <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins in {{that they were not}} part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E
5|$|Desmond Llewelyn as Q: The head of Q-Branch, he {{supplies}} 007 with {{a modified}} Aston Martin DB5. Hamilton told Llewelyn to inject humour into the character, thus beginning the friendly antagonism between Q and Bond {{that became a}} <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series. He had already appeared in the previous Bond film From Russia With Love and, {{with the exception of}} Live and Let Die, would continue to play Q in the next 16 Bond films.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Antillean {{music can}} be {{characterized}} by the prominence of the Carnival celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), {{and the importance of}} calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, the prominence of Indian-influenced styles is a <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn's Labor Day Carnival features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.|$|E

5|$|The victim, as {{presented}} by Goya, is as anonymous as his killers. His entreaty is addressed not to God {{in the manner}} of traditional painting, but to an unheeding and impersonal firing squad. He is not granted the heroism of individuality, but is merely part of a continuum of victims. Beneath him lies a bloody and disfigured corpse; behind and around him are others who will soon share the same fate. Here, for the first time, according to biographer Fred Licht, nobility in individual martyrdom is replaced by futility and irrelevance, the victimization of mass murder, and anonymity as a <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern condition.|$|E
5|$|A <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{curriculum}} {{in the earliest}} days was study organized around major themes—trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects—that built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s—the Maypole dance by the fifth group {{dates back to the}} beginning of the Cottage School.|$|E
5|$|Contested between 9 and 19 March 1995, the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships is the <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> venue, and {{the only}} major world {{championship}} to be contested in Northern Ontario. The Nordic combined individual took place on 9 March, and was won by Fred Børre Lundberg ahead of Jari Mantila. The following day saw Japan win ahead of Norway and Finland in the Nordic combined team event. In ski jumping, the individual normal hill event took place on 12 March, which saw a double Japanese victory with Takanobu Okabe winning ahead of Hiroya Saito. The team event in the large hill on 16 March saw Finland win ahead of Germany and Japan. In the large hill individual event on 18 March, Tommy Ingebrigtsen set a new hill record and won ahead of Andreas Goldberger.|$|E

5|$|The rise of Macedon, {{from a small}} kingdom at the {{periphery}} of classical Greek affairs to one which came to dominate the entire Hellenic world (and beyond), occurred {{in the span of}} just 25 years, between 359 and 336 BC. This ascendancy is largely attributable to the personality and policies of Philip II (r. 359–336 BC). In addition to utilising effective diplomacy and marriage alliances to achieve his political aims, Philip II was also responsible for reforming the ancient Macedonian army into an effective fighting force. The Macedonian phalanx became the <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Macedonian army during his reign and the subsequent Hellenistic period. His army and engineers also made extensive use of siege engines.|$|E
5|$|To further {{provide the}} fair and {{balanced}} view of the topic, script editor Karen Wilson furthered her research by consulting with a Muslim advisor throughout the scripting and filming stages, as well as consulting the Muslims who played extras in the episode. Although Wilson does not usually talk to cast members beforehand, {{it was the first}} time she became aware of the research and advice behind a storyline, and felt that the advice she was given was useful in staging the scenes. It was also based on real life instances, something that Brenton considered a <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series, as many episodes are based on such events. News stories detailing similar instances to the plot came out sometime after the episode's broadcast, and the producers believed it justified the episode. The ending was written to be melancholic, in which there were no winners.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate {{back and forth from the}} doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E

5000|$|Common {{themes in}} the series are betting, gender-specific differences, and Atze Schröder's drive for profit. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series, above all, is that almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{characters}} speak [...] "Ruhrdeutsch".|$|R
25|$|Notable sweets of {{the city}} are Trigona, Roxakia and Armenovil. A stereotypical Thessalonian coffee drink is Frappé coffee. Frappé was invented in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair in 1957 and has since spread {{throughout}} Greece and Cyprus to become a <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek coffee culture.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{condition}} is a sunken {{appearance of the}} sternum. The most common form is a cup-shaped concavity, involving {{the lower end of}} the sternum; also a broader concavity involving the upper costal cartilages is possible. The lower-most ribs may protrude ("flared ribs"). Pectus excavatum defects may be symmetric or asymmetric.|$|E
25|$|In {{one of the}} gables was a <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station's architects, a {{bargeboard}} {{with the}} scroll-sawn word FREIGHT. Aesthetically, it reflects the Stick style common {{in the period of}} its construction, with its well-integrated forms and flamboyant detailing leaving the building's singular function apparent. The battens provide vertical scale and the window trim the horizontal.|$|E
50|$|By 800 BCE, <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tlatilco culture fade {{from the}} archaeological record. By 700 BCE, Cuicuilco {{had become the}} largest and most dynamic city in <b>the</b> Valley <b>of</b> Mexico, eclipsing Tlatilco and Tlapacoya.|$|R
