5|$|Robert Eddison as the Grail Knight: The {{guardian}} of the Grail who <b>drank</b> <b>from</b> the cup of Christ during the Crusades and is immortal {{as long as he}} stays within the temple. Eddison was a stage and television veteran only appearing once before in film (a supporting role in Peter Ustinov's 1948 comedy Vice Versa). Glover recalled Eddison was excited and nervous for his film debut, often asking if he had performed correctly. Laurence Olivier was originally considered to play the Grail Knight, but he was too ill and died the same year in which the film was released.|$|E

Inferring that Spike bit and <b>drank</b> <b>from</b> Anya, Xander pummels him ferociously until Anya wakes and stops him; excited that he fought to defend her, Anya gestures that they should go have sex.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} resumed at 14:00. Weil {{worked the}} final control rod while Fermi carefully monitored the neutron activity. Fermi {{announced that the}} pile had gone critical (reached a self-sustaining reaction) at 15:25. Fermi switched the scale on the recorder to accommodate the rapidly increasing electrical current from the boron trifluoride detector. He wanted to test the control circuits, but after 28 minutes, the alarm bells went off to notify everyone that the neutron flux had passed the preset safety level, and he ordered Zinn to release the zip. The reaction rapidly halted. The pile had run for about 4.5 minutes at about 0.5 watts. Wigner opened a bottle of Chianti, which they <b>drank</b> <b>from</b> paper cups.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the word}} ardo today {{exclusively}} means [...] "wine", the original meaning {{seems to have}} been [...] "fermented drink". This is evidenced by the recorded form mahatsarno [...] "wine"; mahats meaning [...] "grape" [...] so literally [...] "fermented <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> grapes". Thus the original meaning of the related sagardo and garagardo [...] "beer" [...] must have been [...] "fermented <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> apples" [...] and [...] "fermented <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> barley" [...] (garagar [...] "barley").|$|R
5|$|The {{ascent of}} Dhruva Dharavarsha's third son, Govinda III, {{to the throne}} heralded an era of success like never before. There is {{uncertainty}} about {{the location of the}} early capital of the Rashtrakutas at this time. During his rule there was a three way conflict between the Rashtrakutas, the Palas and the Pratiharas for control over the Gangetic plains. Describing his victories over the Pratihara Emperor Nagabhatta II and the Pala Emperor Dharmapala, the Sanjan inscription states the horses of Govinda III <b>drank</b> <b>from</b> the icy waters of the Himalayan streams and his war elephants tasted the sacred waters of the Ganges. His military exploits have been compared to those of Alexander the Great and Arjuna of Mahabharata. Having conquered Kannauj, he travelled south, took firm hold over Gujarat, Kosala (Kaushal), Gangavadi, humbled the Pallavas of Kanchi, installed a ruler of his choice in Vengi and received two statues as an act of submission from the king of Ceylon (one statue of the king and another of his minister). The Cholas, the Pandyas and the Cheras all paid him tribute. As one historian puts it, the drums of the Deccan were heard from the Himalayan caves to the shores of the Malabar. The Rashtrakutas empire now spread over the areas from Cape Comorin to Kannauj and from Banaras to Bharuch.|$|E

5000|$|Desperately, {{the girl}} begs her brother not to <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> the spring, lest he {{transform}} into a tiger and tear her to pieces. So they continue on their way, {{but when they}} come to the second spring the girl hears it say, [...] "Whoever <b>drinks</b> <b>from</b> me will become a wolf". Again, she desperately tries to prevent her brother from drinking from it. Reluctantly, he eventually agrees to her pleas but insists he <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> the next spring they encounter. And so they arrive at the third spring, and the girl overhears the rushing water cry, [...] "Whoever <b>drinks</b> <b>from</b> me will become a deer". But it is too late, because her brother has already drunk from it, and changes into a deer.|$|R

25|$|The rise of Taliban {{insurgency}} in Pakistan {{has been an}} influential and increasing factor in the persecution of and discrimination against religious minorities in Pakistan, such as Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, and other minorities. Hindu minorities living {{under the influence of}} the Taliban in Swat, Pakistan, were forced to wear red headgear such as turbans as a symbol of dhimmi. In July 2010, around 60 members of the minority Hindus in Karachi were attacked and ethnically cleansed following an incident when a Hindu youth <b>drank</b> <b>from</b> a water tap near an Islamic mosque. In January 2014, in an attack on a temple, the guard was gunned down.|$|E
25|$|At the 1993 Indianapolis 500, winner Emerson Fittipaldi, {{who owned}} and {{operated}} an orange grove, notoriously drank orange juice instead of milk during the televised winner's interview. He eventually relented and also <b>drank</b> <b>from</b> the milk bottle later in the post-race ceremonies after the broadcast was over, but the public relations damage had already been done. The snub led to Fittipaldi being booed at the next ChampCar race, the Milwaukee Mile, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the heart of dairy country, and by some, {{as late as the}} 2008 Indianapolis 500 in which he drove the pace car. In the 2016 Indianapolis 500, as a promotion, the track gave out commemorative bottles of milk to 100,000 attendees to toast the winner with milk after the race.|$|E
25|$|There {{have long}} been tales of hauntings at The Grotto, mainly {{relating}} to a smuggler named John the Jibber who was reputedly murdered by his fellow criminals after selling information to HM Customs. It is {{said that he was}} hung in a barrel in a cave close to the present lift shaft and left to starve. Until the pub was sold by Vaux, it was said that the landlord would leave out a special tankard of ale each night after closing and, in the morning, it would be empty. Local DJ and TV presenter, Alan Robson <b>drank</b> <b>from</b> the tankard during one of his live Metro Radio shows, allegedly sparking off a series of supernatural phenomena that eventually forced the then landlord to quit. This included flying ashtrays smashing against the wall and flooding in the cellar after all the beer taps were inexplicably turned on. Unfortunately the original tankard was lost during refurbishment. A replacement is on display, but is no longer filled up each night for the ghost. The pub was also the venue for a uktv investigation in 2001, where paranormal researchers claimed to have identified at least seven different spirits.|$|E

25|$|Among the Horseman's Word {{group in}} Angus, {{initiation}} ceremonies typically {{took place at}} night, preferably {{at the time of}} the full moon, in an isolated barn, byre, stable, or steading. An individual known as the High Horseman would be seated in this space, holding a cloven goat's hoof in his hand; he would preside over the ceremony. The apprentice was then stripped to the waste and blindfolded, and spun around by his fellows in order to disorient him before being brought into the ceremonial space and made to stand before the High Horseman. The High Horseman asked a series of set questions of his fellows at which they responded with a series of set answers. Turning to the initiate, who I made to kneel and has his blindfold removed, the High Horseman then commanded the newcomer to provide vows to keep to the group's secrets. This achieved, all those assembled then recited the Horseman's Creed, which reminded them of the punishments that should befall them should they break their vows. Following the ceremony, a ceilidh was held in which toasts were made and the assembled horsemen <b>drank</b> <b>from</b> whisky that the apprentice had been required to bring with him.|$|E
25|$|Wallach and Eastwood flew to Madrid {{together}} and between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing. Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally <b>drank</b> <b>from</b> {{a bottle of}} acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring {{the safety of his}} actors during dangerous scenes. For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back. The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where he and Mario Brega—who are chained together—jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.|$|E

500|$|During the credits, {{there is}} a final cut scene between Amelia and an Old Coot first {{introduced}} earlier in the campaign. At first, his comments regarding how her family must be proud of her seem out of place—then he makes {{a reference to the}} Circle and how she was able to defeat them in only one lifetime, hinting that he is indeed the original Morgan Black. [...] As the Old Coot walks away, his voice grows deeper with a more exaggerated Scottish accent, further supporting this idea. [...] It appears he has lived longer than the average person because he <b>drank</b> <b>from</b> the Fountain of Youth after Act I. Amelia then asks what he just said, he replies with a knowing, [...] "Don't miss your train," [...] and then he walks away.|$|E
500|$|The {{area which}} is now Tunbridge Wells {{was part of the}} parish of Speldhurst for {{hundreds}} of years, but the origin of the town as it is today, however, came in the seventeenth century. In 1606 Dudley, Lord North, a courtier to James I who was staying at a hunting lodge in Eridge {{in the hope that the}} country air might improve his ailing constitution, discovered a chalybeate spring. He <b>drank</b> <b>from</b> the spring and, when his health improved, he became convinced that it had healing properties. He persuaded his rich friends in London to try it, and by the time Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of King Charles I, visited in 1630 it had established itself as a spa retreat. By 1636 it had become so popular that two houses were built next to the spring to cater for the visitors, one for the ladies and one for the gentlemen, and in 1664 Lord Muskerry, Lord of the Manor, enclosed it with a triangular stone wall, and built a hall [...] "to shelter the dippers in wet weather." ...|$|E
500|$|A legend {{associated}} {{with the history of}} this beer relates to the Benedictine monk named Bernard of Wąbrzeźno. [...] Around 1603, he arrived from the Benedictine monastery in Lubiń to find the residents starving and the town's wells depleted. [...] The brewery was the primary source of income for the city and the hospital. [...] Bernard prayed for the wells and a new source of water suddenly filled the Old Market well. [...] Legends claimed that the newly refilled well had the ability to make whoever <b>drank</b> <b>from</b> it healthy again, and the beer that was produced from the water was far superior to any of the beer the brewers had been able to produce before. [...] The well became a municipal treasure and was given credit for the commercial success of the breweries over the centuries to follow. [...] For over 200 years after the event, the residents of Grodzisk would make an annual procession to Bernard's monastery to bring a keg of the beer that they made from the well as a show of gratitude.|$|E
