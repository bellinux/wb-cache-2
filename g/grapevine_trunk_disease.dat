40|$|Three major <b>grapevine</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>diseases,</b> esca, botryosphaeria dieback and eutypa dieback, pose {{important}} economic problems for vineyards worldwide, and currently, no efficient treatment {{is available to}} control these diseases. The different fungi associated with <b>grapevine</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>diseases</b> can be isolated in the necrotic wood, {{but not in the}} symptomatic leaves. Other factors seem to be responsible for the foliar symptoms and may represent the link between wood and foliar symptoms. One hypothesis is that the extracellular compounds produced by the fungi associated with <b>grapevine</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>diseases</b> are responsible for pathogenicity. In the present work, we used Vitis vinifera cv. Chardonnay cells to test the aggressiveness of total extracellular compounds produced by Diplodia seriata and Neofusicoccum parvum, two causal agents associated with botryosphaeria dieback. Additionally, the toxicity of purified mellein, a characteristic toxin present in the extracellular compounds of Botryosphaeriaceae, was assessed. Our results show that the total extracellular compounds produced by N. parvum induce more necrosis on Chardonnay calli and induce a different defence gene expression pattern than those of D. seriata. Mellein was produced by both fungi in amounts proportional to its aggressiveness. However, when purified mellein was added to the culture medium of calli, only a delayed necrosis and a lower-level expression of defence genes were observed. Extracellular compounds seem {{to be involved in the}} pathogenicity of the fungi associated with botryosphaeria dieback. However, the doses of mellein used in this study are 100 times higher than those found in the liquid fungal cultures: therefore, the possible function of this toxin is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Esca and Petri disease, two of {{the most}} {{important}} fungal <b>trunk</b> <b>diseases</b> of <b>grapevine,</b> are responsible for significant losses by causing premature decline and dieback in vineyards worldwide. The Portuguese Dão wine region is no exception. Local winegrowers’ knowledge on <b>Grapevine</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Diseases</b> (GTD) in general and of esca and Petri disease in particular is incomplete. The real scope of those problems has been based largely on individual perceptions rather than on a methodical evaluation of the situation. In order to get a full picture of the diseases impact, a leaflet with color pictures was produced and issued to winegrowers, accompanied by a simple questionnaire. The results of this survey represent a first indication of the extent of <b>grapevine</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>diseases</b> in the Dão wine region, specifically its economic impact and relevance to the local wine industry. In conjunction with the survey, several samples of wood collected from esca and Petri disease symptomatic vines, identified during the survey throughout the entire region, were processed and a collection of isolates of Phaeomoniella chlamydospora obtained. To determine the intra-specific variability among these isolates, morphological, cultural and molecular characteristics were evaluated.

Herein, a proteome comparison of the brown striped wood from Botryosphaeria dieback-affected standing vines cultivar 'Chardonnay', 'Gewurztraminer' and 'Mourvèdre' was performed. The transcript analysis for 15 targeted genes and the quantification of both total phenolics and specific stilbenes were also performed. Several pathogenesis-related proteins and members of the antioxidant system were more abundant in the brown striped wood of the three cultivars, whereas other defense-related proteins were less abundant. Additionally, total phenolics and some specific stilbenes were more accumulated in the brown striped wood. Strongest differences among the cultivars concerned especially proteins of the primary metabolism, which looked to be particularly impaired in the brown striped wood of 'Chardonnay'. Low abundance of some proteins involved in defense response probably contributes to make global response insufficient to avoid the symptom development. The differential susceptibility of the three grapevine cultivars could be linked to the diverse expression of various proteins involved in defense response, stress tolerance and metabolism...|$|E

40|$|In Chile, {{there are}} {{approximately}} 182, 000 ha planted with grapevines (Vitis vinífera L.), extending over 1, 500 km along a north-south axis through diverse weather and soil conditions. In the last 40 years, <b>trunk</b> <b>diseases</b> have been recognized as important factors that affect the production of table grapes and wine grapes in Chile. <b>Trunk</b> <b>diseases</b> {{are known to be}} an economically important problem in grapevine production areas in the world, considerably reducing the productive and life of vineyards (13). Esca disease, Petri disease, Botryosphaeria dieback and Eutypa dieback, collectively known as <b>trunk</b> <b>diseases,</b> are the predominant <b>diseases</b> that affect <b>grapevine</b> <b>trunks</b> (4, 13). Dead arm (Phomopsis vitícola) was recognized as an important problem in the 1960 s in Chile (15). In addition, Petri disease and Botryosphaeria dieback have been reported in Chile lately (1, 3, 8, 9). The aerial symptoms observed in <b>grapevines</b> affected with <b>trunk</b> <b>diseases</b> include decline, shortened internodes, stunted growth, and deformed, chlorotic or necrotic leaves. The interna! symptoms are characterized by the presence of cankers that are mainly formed by a brown to black discoloration of the xylem tissue (black wood streaking in longitudinal sections), brown, hard decay (Vshaped) or black discoloration with brown, hard decay and white to yellowish soft decay in the woody tissues (4, 10, 13). Brown to black wood streaking are the interna! symptoms that are most prevalently observed in <b>grapevine</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>diseases</b> (4, 10). Severa! filamentous fungi, including species of Botryosphaeriaceae, Diatrypaceae, Phaeoacremonium., Phaeomoniella (Pa.) chlamydospora and such lignicolous basidiomycetes as Fomitiporia spp. and lnocutis spp., are associated with <b>grapevine</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>diseases</b> worldwide (4, 5, 1 O, 13). Although Pa. chlamydospora has been described as one of the majar pathogens causing <b>trunk</b> <b>diseases</b> of <b>grapevines</b> in ltaly (1 O), Diatrypaceae and Botryosphaeriaceae species are the principal fungal pathogens associated with <b>trunk</b> <b>diseases</b> in Australia and California (4, 12, 13).

The aim of this work was to develop a simple model system to reproduce the foliar symptoms caused by D. seriata and N. parvum to better characterize fungal pathogenicity and determine the mechanisms involved in symptom development. Green stems of grafted grapevine cuttings cv.

Three months after inoculation, the lesions associated with N. parvum were larger than those associated with D. seriata. Similarly, eight months after inoculation the percentage of plants showing foliar symptoms was greater in the N. parvum treatments than in the D. seriata treatments. During the emergence of foliar symptoms, plant stress-related responses were modulated in green stems and leaves, especially a down-regulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein (fascAGP) and an up-regulation of stilbene synthase (STS) with an accumulation of phenolics.

Moreover the pathogens are detectable not only from the symptomatic, but also from the asymptomatic plants. There is very limited information about the occurrence of the GTD pathogens. Control of GTD is problematic, as no grapevine cultivar is known to be resistant to GTD and there are no highly effective treatments available. The aims of our research were to evaluate the incidence of <b>Grapevine</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Diseases</b> in Tokaj Wine region and the isolation and identification of the GTD pathogens and other endophytes from the symptomatic woody tissues. Our previous results in a one year survey in the Tokaj Wine Region indicated the presence of the GTD pathogen Diplodia seriata, Diaporthe eres, and Botryosphaeria stevensii in the vineyards. Other endophytic fungi (Alternaria sp., Bionectria sp., Aspergillus sp., Epicoccum sp., Fusarium sp., Phoma sp., Pheniophora sp., Trichoderma sp.) also could be identified. In a two year survey, where a total of more than 10. 000 trunks were monitored in five vineyards of the Tokaj Wine Region, the rate of the diseased dead vines recorded in 2014 was lower compared to the number of dead vines recorded in 2013, which was an extremely dry and warm year. Differences between the isolated endophytic microbes were found comparing isolated endophytes from GTD symptomatic and asymptomatic plants...|$|R
