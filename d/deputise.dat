5|$|The {{class was}} {{gradually}} superseded on top link expresses during the 1940s by {{growing numbers of}} Bulleid Pacifics, although throughout the 1950s they were frequently called upon during peak periods or to <b>deputise</b> for failures. The rebuilding of the Pacifics in the late 1950s and their subsequent increased reliability rendered the Lord Nelson surplus to operational requirements, and they were gradually phased out of service. The entire class was withdrawn during 1961 and 1962.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} said of Hannah de Rothschild that she {{grew up with a}} good sense and {{presence}} of mind, enabling her to <b>deputise</b> for her mother on grand social occasions at Mentmore and in London. This gave her confidence and the experience to be the perfect political wife. Marriage to her altered Rosebery's status, too: while his wife acquired Christian respectability and a title, Rosebery moved from being one of many wealthy and capable young noblemen to being one with unfathomable riches. This, coupled with his good looks, appealed to the public's imagination and gave him glamour.|$|E
5|$|After {{its season}} in London the company {{performed}} in Vienna, Budapest, Prague and Berlin. The tour was successful, artistically and financially, {{but was not}} without untoward incident. A planned visit to St Petersburg had to be cancelled because the Narodny Dom theatre burned down, and in Vienna the Philharmonic was unequal to the difficulties of the score of Petrushka. The illustrious orchestra revolted at the rehearsal for the first performance, refusing to play for Monteux; only an intervention by Diaghilev restored the rehearsal, {{by the end of}} which Monteux was applauded and Stravinsky given an ovation. In the middle of the tour Monteux was briefly summoned back to Paris by the Concerts Colonne, which had the contractual right to recall him, to <b>deputise</b> for Pierné; his own deputy, Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht, took temporary musical charge of the Ballets Russes.|$|E

5|$|With Krul {{back for}} the 2008–09 season and Given back to full fitness, it was the turn of Forster to go on loan. He was loaned out to Stockport County on 2 October 2008, to <b>deputise</b> for regular goalkeeper Owain Fôn Williams while he was away on {{international}} duty with Wales. Forster started his first match for Stockport on 7 October in the Football League Trophy second round, where they lost 1–0 away to Bury. He started his first league match for Stockport on 11 October, where his team drew 1–1 away to Southend United. He returned to Newcastle on 1 November, after completing his loan stint at Stockport playing six league matches and keeping three clean sheets.|$|E
25|$|James was {{originally}} selected as second wicketkeeper, but {{made such a}} strong impression that he played in almost every match; only in some minor matches did Lowry <b>deputise</b> for James as wicketkeeper. Of the 14 regulars, only Bernau, Cunningham, Dacre and Oliver did not go on to play Test cricket; of the irregulars, Blundell came closest to Test cricket, representing New Zealand against MCC on an unofficial tour in 1935–36.|$|E
25|$|On 13 September 2015, Corbyn {{unveiled}} his Shadow Cabinet. He appointed {{his leadership}} campaign manager and long-standing political ally John McDonnell as Shadow Chancellor, leadership opponent Andy Burnham as Shadow Home Secretary, and Angela Eagle as Shadow First Secretary of State to <b>deputise</b> {{for him in}} the House of Commons. Corbyn promoted a number of female backbench MPs to Shadow Cabinet roles, including Diane Abbott, Heidi Alexander and Lisa Nandy, making his the first Shadow Cabinet with more women than men, although the most senior roles went to men.|$|E

25|$|Roper {{immediately}} {{became a}} regular for the Gunners, playing 40 times and scoring ten goals in 1947–48, as Arsenal won the First Division. He {{switched to the}} left wing in 1949–50 but was displaced by Denis Compton in Arsenal's FA Cup-winning side of 1950. He regained his place the following season, and {{continued to be a}} near ever-present for Arsenal for the next five. He played in Arsenal's 1952 FA Cup Final defeat to Newcastle United, although in that match he was forced to <b>deputise</b> for full back Walley Barnes after Barnes was stretchered off with an injury.|$|E
25|$|Jack Phillipps, {{the tour}} manager, played in one minor match against Durham (not then first-class). Reid, a lively fast bowler {{as well as}} a batsman, was used as the second wicketkeeper and had to <b>deputise</b> in the fourth Test for Mooney, who was unfit. Of the 15 players, 13 {{appeared}} in the Test matches. The exceptions were Burke, who had played his only Test match in the game against Australia in 1945-46, and Hayes, who was injured for much of this tour but became a regular player for New Zealand across much of the 1950s, touring England again in 1958. Cave, Reid and Sutcliffe also toured with the 1958 side.|$|E
25|$|On 23 September 2013, England {{announced}} a 17-man touring {{party for the}} Ashes series. Former Ireland international bowler Boyd Rankin, New Zealand-born all-rounder Ben Stokes and Zimbabwe-born batsman Gary Ballance all received call-ups despite being uncapped for England in Tests, while opening batsman Michael Carberry, spin bowler Monty Panesar and seamer Chris Tremlett were also included. Among those who missed out were opening batsman Nick Compton, spin bowler James Tredwell and seamers Graham Onions, who helped Durham win the championship, and Tim Bresnan, although Bresnan was suffering from a back injury and still travelled with the squad to Australia. Matt Prior was the only specialist wicket-keeper in the side; Jonny Bairstow was designated to <b>deputise</b> for him.|$|E

25|$|Disappointingly, {{the fifth}} Test was a one-sided affair. Australia won the toss and chose to bat on a well-watered pitch. And then tumbled to 99 for 9. Fred Spofforth, however, {{partially}} rescued {{them with a}} half-century when batting at number 11, and the Aussies ended on 163. Arthur Shrewsbury then became the first England captain to score a century as England put on 386. During Australia's second innings, Tom Garrett, one of the home players, had to <b>deputise</b> for umpire Hodges when Hodges refused to stand after tea {{on the third day}} because of England's complaints about his decisions. However, England were well on top, and Australia were dismissed for 125, with George McShane, who had stood as an umpire in the fourth Test, left stranded on 5 not out. England had won the series 3–2.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} series as captain, against South Africa, Stewart scored an {{outstanding}} 164 {{in the third}} Test at Old Trafford to salvage a draw, a result which eventually enabled England to overturn a 1–0 deficit to win the series 2–1. Nonetheless, failures against Australia and in the 1999 cricket World Cup saw him sacked from the captaincy {{to be replaced by}} Hussain. During his captaincy, he had the unusual distinction of simultaneously captaining the side, opening the batting and keeping wicket. He continued to <b>deputise</b> occasionally as captain of England's one-day side, and became the second international captain to concede a match in 2001, after a pitch invasion during a One Day International against Pakistan rendered the continuation of play impossible. He continued as an England player for five more seasons, and became only the fourth player to score a century in his 100th Test, scoring 105 against the West Indies at Old Trafford in 2000.|$|E

[...] No-one was injured, but the incident resulted in the withdrawal of all Merchant Navy class locomotives from service whilst the cause was ascertained. [...] An examination of other class members showed that the fracture, caused by metal fatigue, was a common fault. [...] To cover the motive power shortage caused by the mass withdrawal of thirty locomotives, classes from other British Railways regions were drafted in to <b>deputise.</b> The incident resulted in a redesign and replacement of the crank axle.|$|E
500|$|Sealey was not fit in {{time for}} the final, so Harford {{selected}} Andy Dibble to <b>deputise</b> in only his sixth game of the season. Mal Donaghy passed a fitness test and partnered Steve Foster in defence, while Rob Johnson was preferred as left back to Ashley Grimes. Hill and Preece came back into the side in midfield, and Brian Stein played behind Harford and Kingsley Black. As expected for Arsenal, Graham paired Caesar with Adams in central defence, and Davis returned to the first eleven after his short illness. Up front, Smith was positioned alongside Groves. Harford set his team up in a 4–3–3 formation, whereas Graham went for the traditional [...] 4–4–2 system: a four-man defence (comprising two centre-backs and left and right full-backs), four midfielders (two in the centre, and one on each wing) and two centre-forwards.|$|E
500|$|Clive Carey, who {{had been}} in Australia during the war, was brought back to replace Joan Cross and rebuild the company. The critic Philip Hope-Wallace wrote in 1946 that Carey had begun to make a difference, but that Sadler's Wells needed [...] "a big heave to get out of mediocrity". In the same year, The Times Literary Supplement asked whether the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells {{companies}} would stick to their old bases, [...] "or shall they boldly embrace the ideal of a National Theatre and a National Opera in English?" [...] Carey left in 1947, replaced in January 1948 by a triumvirate of James Robertson as musical director, Michael Mudie as his assistant conductor and Norman Tucker in charge of administration. From October 1948, Tucker was given sole control. Mudie became ill, and the young Charles Mackerras was appointed to <b>deputise</b> for him.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} process of out of hours care {{provided}} by general practitioners from patients' own practices and by commercial <b>deputising</b> services. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Four urban areas in Manchester, Salford, Stockport, and Leicester. SUBJECTS: 2152 patients who requested out of hours care, and 49 practice doctors and 183 <b>deputising</b> doctors (61 % local principals) who responded to those requests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response to call, time to visit, prescribing, and hospital admissions. RESULTS: 1046 calls were dealt with by practice doctors and 1106 by <b>deputising</b> doctors. Practice doctors {{were more likely to}} give telephone advice (20. 2 % v 0. 72 % of calls) and to visit more quickly than <b>deputising</b> doctors (median delay 35 minutes v 52 minutes). Practice doctors were less likely than <b>deputising</b> doctors to issue a prescription (56. 1 % v 63. 2 % of patients) or to prescribe an antibiotic (43. 7 % v 61. 3 % of prescriptions issued) and more likely to prescribe genetic drugs (58. 4 % v 32. 1 % of drugs prescribed), cheaper drugs (mean cost per prescription pounds 3. 28 v pounds 5. 04), and drugs in a predefined out of hours formulary (49. 8 % v 41. 1 % of drugs prescribed). There {{was no significant difference in}} the number of hospital admissions. CONCLUSIONS: By contrast with practice doctors, <b>deputising</b> doctors providing out of hours care less readily give telephone advice, take longer to visit at home, and have patterns of prescribing that may be less discriminating...|$|R

500|$|After {{modification}} by Maunsell, the S15 {{class was}} regarded by locomotive crews as an excellent goods engine {{best known for}} working heavy night express goods trains between Exeter, Southampton and Nine Elms. The S15s were also very capable passenger engines, being able to <b>deputise</b> in situations {{where there was a}} shortage of passenger locomotives during peak holiday periods. Both Urie and Maunsell S15s spent most of their working lives on the Southern Railway's Western section, although they were sometimes used on inter-regional freights. In order to increase maintenance efficiency, all Urie S15 locomotives (which had the lower boiler pressure) were concentrated at the Southern Railway's London freight depot at Feltham. This yard also featured the Maunsell S15s, which were allocated to Exmouth Junction, Hither Green and Salisbury, demonstrating the [...] "go anywhere" [...] nature of the class. Despite the design being only a year newer, the S15s outlasted their N15 King Arthur class counterparts because of their dual freight/passenger abilities, though they were retired between 1962 and 1966 as part of the British Railways Modernisation Plan. Maunsell S15 number 30837 became the final member of the class in operation, returning to Feltham in January 1966 to work a farewell rail tour.|$|E
500|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century there were no {{permanent}} salaried orchestras in London. The main orchestras were those of Covent Garden, the Philharmonic Society and the Queen's Hall; their proprietors engaged players individually for each concert or for a season. As there were competing demands for the services of the finest players it was an accepted practice that, even though under contract to play for a concert, a player was at liberty to accept a better-paid engagement if it were offered. He would then engage another player to <b>deputise</b> at him for the original concert and the rehearsals for it. The treasurer of the Philharmonic Society described the system thus: [...] "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away." [...] There was much competition for good orchestral players, with well-paid engagements offered by more than fifty music halls, by pit bands in West End musical comedies, and by grand hotels and restaurants which maintained orchestras.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{the death}} of John of Gaunt on 3 February 1399, his son Henry Bolingbroke became the Duke of Lancaster, but Richard II moved quickly to strip him of his patrimony. Bolingbroke {{resolved}} to return to England from Paris to claim the restoration of his family estates and in July 1399 he disembarked at Ravenspur. Henry le Despenser reacted to these events by standing loyally by Richard. On 2 July he commissioned three vicars-general to <b>deputise</b> for him whilst he was absent from the diocese and by 10 July he had reached St. Albans with reinforcements for the Duke of York's army. There he joined up with York and they travelled to join the king as he returned from Ireland, whilst Bolingbroke moved south towards Bristol to intercept Richard's supporters. [...] Despenser was with York at Berkeley Castle {{when he came to}} terms with Bolingbroke at the end of July, but the bishop refused to submit and was arrested and briefly imprisoned. On 30 September Bolingbroke was proclaimed king in London, an event that Despenser may have witnessed. The bishop attended the first parliament of the new reign on 6 October 1399, in which it was agreed that King Richard should be imprisoned. After this time Despenser's influence in his diocese seems to have diminished, power having shifted to Sir Thomas Erpingham.|$|E
