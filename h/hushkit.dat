40|$|On May 4, 2000, the EU {{enacted the}} {{so-called}} ’hushkit regulation ‘ with the stated aim of reducing aircraft noise levels by significantly curbing {{the use of}} hushkitted (i. e. muffled) or re-engined older-generation jet aeroplanes at Community airports. The USA, however, home of both the entire <b>hushkit</b> industry {{and the vast majority}} of the operators and owners of the potentially affected aircraft, immediately demanded the regulation’s repeal, denouncing its purely protectionist intent and effects and threatening the EU with retaliatory action. After a lengthy political and legal controversy the EU, in October 2001, gave in and withdrew the legislation. In this paper we evaluate the late ’hushkit regulation ‘ from three different perspectives – environmental policy, trade policy and rent-seeking potential – to determine its respective merits and demerits. i Table of contents Abstract [...] i Table of contents [...] i...|$|E
40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{aircraft noise}} regulations {{as they relate}} to <b>hushkits,</b> which is a combination of strategies designed to reduce aircraft noise. These strategies can include new technologies, redesigned engine enclosures, replacement engine components, entirely new engines, or a combination of any of the above. This report dicusses the new EU regulation limiting <b>hushkitted</b> commercial jet aircraft in the EU, the United States' response to this regulation, and the effect this could have on international air travel relations...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{aircraft}} {{equipped with}} high-bypass turbofan engines {{are able to}} comply with contemporary aviation noise abatement laws and ICAO regulations. Hush kits are used on the many older freight and passenger aircraft still in service, such as the Boeing 727 and 737-200, Douglas DC-8 and DC-9, and Tupolev Tu-154. While <b>hushkits</b> are normally found on older aircraft, small business jets and other aircraft {{too small to be}} fitted with large, high bypass turbofan engines will be manufactured with <b>hushkits</b> installed, a more economical way to meet noise restrictions than expensive engine or design changes.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s several {{airlines}} approached McDonnell Douglas for noise reduction {{modifications to the}} DC-8 but nothing was done. Third parties had developed aftermarket <b>hushkits</b> {{but there was no}} real move to keep the DC-8 in service. Finally, in 1975, General Electric began discussions with major airlines with a view to fitting the new and vastly quieter Franco-American CFM56 engine to both DC-8s and 707s. MDC remained reluctant but eventually came on board in the late 1970s and helped develop the Series 70.|$|R
2500|$|In 2013, the FAA {{modified}} 14 CFR part 91 {{rules to}} prohibit {{the operation of}} jets weighing 75,000 pounds or less that are not stage 3 noise compliant after December 31, 2015. [...] The Learjet 23 is listed explicitly in Federal Register [...] [...] Any Learjet 23s {{that have not been}} modified by installing Stage 3 noise compliant engines or have not had [...] "hushkits" [...] installed for non-compliant engines will not be permitted to fly in the contiguous 48 states after December 31, 2015, and the rule points out that appropriate <b>hushkits</b> are not currently available for the Learjet 23. 14 CFR §91.883 Special flight authorizations for jet airplanes weighing 75,000 pounds or less - lists special flight authorizations that may be granted for operation after December 31, 2015.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of sound levels, engine {{operation}} is of greatest impact with respect to mobile sources such as automobiles and trucks. Engine noise is a particularly large component of mobile source noise for vehicles operating at lower speeds, where aerodynamic and tire noise is less significant. Generally speaking, petrol and diesel engines emit less noise than turboshafts of equivalent power output; electric motors very often emit less noise than their fossil fuel-powered equivalents. Thrust-outputting engines, such as turbofans, turbojets and rockets emit {{the greatest amount of}} noise because their method of producing thrust {{is directly related to the}} production of sound.Various methods have been devised to reduce noise. Petrol and diesel engines are fitted with mufflers (silencers); newer turbofans often have outsized fans (the so-called high-bypass technology) in order to reduce the proportion of noisy, hot exhaust from the integrated turboshaft in the exhaust stream, and <b>hushkits</b> exist for older, low-bypass turbofans. No known methods exist for reducing the noise output of rockets without a corresponding reduction in thrust.|$|R
