40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that the {{assumptions}} of the neoclassical and wage efficiency models do not adequately explain the governance structure of <b>employment</b> <b>relationships.</b> Trust may be a constituent element of at least some <b>employment</b> <b>relationships,</b> e. g, those of child minders. According to the tradition of research in social science, trust is established by gifts. It is argued that in <b>employment</b> <b>relationships</b> in which both employer and employee have a gain and damage potential, gifts will be used to establish a trust relationship. This argument helps to produce new hypotheses about wages and allocation in <b>employment</b> <b>relationships.</b> The model is elaborated for the <b>employment</b> <b>relationships</b> of child minders. It is shown that it is not only job and human capital characteristics that determine wages, but also the financial resources of the parents (or employers). In addition, more personal means of exchange are used to establish trust relationships. It is concluded that the trust argument helps to explain different governance structures in <b>employment</b> <b>relationships...</b>|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} argued that 'new economy' jobs {{are less likely}} to use {{traditional}} <b>employment</b> <b>relationships,</b> and more likely to rely on 'alternative' or 'contingent' work. When we look at new economy jobs classified on the basis of employment in high-tech industries, we do not find greater use of contingent or alternative <b>employment</b> <b>relationships.</b> However, when we classify new economy workers based on residence in high-tech cities, contingent and alternative <b>employment</b> <b>relationships</b> are more common, even after accounting for the faster employment growth in these cities. Finally, defining 'new economy' more literally to be those industries with the fastest growth yields the most striking differences, as workers in the fastest-growing industries {{are much more likely to}} be in contingent or alternative <b>employment</b> <b>relationships,</b> with a large share of this difference driven by employment in the fast-growing construction and personnel supply services industries where employment is perhaps 'intrinsically' contingent or alternative. While subject to numerous qualifications, the combined evidence gives some support to the hypothesis that the new economy may entail a possibly significant and long-lasting increase in contingent and alternative <b>employment</b> <b>relationships.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|This {{raises the}} {{question}} why does an employer ever do {{more than it is}} legally obliged to do ? One theory seeking to explain this behaviour is that employment {{is an example of a}} relational contract, based upon a relationship of trust between the parties.

The High Court has long held there is a distinction between the <b>employment</b> <b>relationship</b> and the contract of employment.|$|E

40|$|This article {{critically}} analyses intersubjective negotiation in {{the context}} of small firm <b>employment</b> <b>relationships.</b> These <b>employment</b> <b>relationships</b> are generally acknowledged as ad hoc, contested and negotiated, producing mutual adjustment between owner-managers and employees. We present detailed qualitative empirical material from three small professional service firms and argue that explicit instances of formal or informal negotiation cannot be understood as discrete events disassociated from ongoing, everyday intersubjective negotiations. The negotiation of <b>employment</b> <b>relationships,</b> especially in ambiguity-intensive small professional service firms, frequently draws on the perception of other actors’ value or interests rather than on any direct engagement with them. This intersubjective guesswork underlying mutual adjustment is potentially dysfunctional as outcomes can arise that satisfy neither owner-manager nor employee interests. We suggest that understanding <b>employment</b> <b>relationships</b> in small professional service firms requires greater focus on individuals’ perceptions {{and the ways in which}} their relative positions are structured in intersubjective mutual (mis) recognition...|$|R

25|$|A {{law passed}} in January 1974, {{designed}} to protect members of the supervisory boards of companies who are undergoing training, was aimed at ensuring that the representatives of young workers and youthful members of works councils still undergoing training could perform their duties with greater independence and without fear of disadvantageous consequences for their future careers. On request, workers' representatives on completion of their training courses had to have an <b>employment</b> <b>relationship</b> of unlimited duration. In the field of transport, the Municipal Transportation Finance Law of 1971 established federal guidelines for subsidies to municipal governments, while the Federal Transport Plan of 1973 provided a framework for all transport, including public transport.

25|$|In Australia the <b>employment</b> <b>relationship</b> {{involves}} {{a degree of}} trust and confidence, particularly for a corporate employer that can only act through its employees. An employer may summarily dismiss an employee who destroys that trust and confidence. An employer may seek to entice or motivate its employees in the expectation of receiving a bonus payment or promises of fair treatment. Statute, regulation and industrial awards may provide the “means by which employees may be protected from abuses of power by the employer, and provides means of redress to employees who are aggrieved by some conduct of the employer” In some instances however the availability of redress may be less certain, for example a bonus payment made {{be left to the}} discretion of the employer, or the promises of fair treatment may be contained solely in policies of the employer. The employee trusts that the employer will deliver on that expectation or promise. The question arising in Mr Barker's case was whether the expectation or promise in the Bank's policies were legally enforceable.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{implied term}} of an {{employment}} contract {{that may be}} broken is mutual trust and confidence. In Johnson v Unisys Ltd the House of Lords held by 4 to 1 that damages for breach of mutual trust and confidence {{at the point of}} dismissal should not exceed the statutory limit on unfair dismissal claims, because otherwise the statutory limits would be undermined. This limit was £74,200 in 2013, though the median award was merely £4,560. This meant a computer worker who developed a psychiatric illness following a wrongful dismissal procedure could not claim his total economic losses, which would have amounted to £400,000 in damages. However, if the breach occurs while the <b>employment</b> <b>relationship</b> subsists, that limit is inapplicable. So in Eastwood v Magnox Electric plc, a school teacher who also suffered psychiatric injury, but as a result of harassment and victimisation while he still worked, could claim for a full measure of damages for the breach of mutual trust and confidence. In any event the limit is merely implied and depends on construction of the contract, so that it may be opted out of by express words providing for a higher sum, for example, by expressly providing for a disciplinary procedure. A notable absence of an implied term at common law historically (i.e. before the development of mutual trust and confidence) was that an employer would have to give any good reasons for a dismissal. This was recommended to be changed in the Donovan Report 1968, and it launched the present system of unfair dismissal.|$|E
40|$|Long-term <b>employment</b> <b>relationships</b> {{have long}} been an {{important}} feature {{of the labor market}} in the United States. However, increased international competition and the wave of corporate downsizing in the 1990 s raised concerns that long-term <b>employment</b> <b>relationships</b> in the United States were disappearing. I present evidence in this study, based on data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 1973 - 2006, that long-term <b>employment</b> <b>relationships</b> have, in fact, become much less common for men in the private sector. Mirroring this decline in tenure and long-term <b>employment</b> <b>relationships,</b> there has been an increase in “churning ” (defined as the proportion of workers in jobs with less than one year of tenure) for males in the private sector as they enter their thirties and later. In contrast, women have seen no systematic change in job durations or the incidence of longterm <b>employment</b> <b>relationships</b> in the private sector. There has been an increase in job durations and the incidence of long-term <b>employment</b> <b>relationships</b> in the public sector, with the increase more pronounced for women. I conclude that 1) the structure of jobs in the private sector has moved away from long-term relationships, 2) this decline has been offset for females by their increased attachment to the labor force, and 3) the public sector has been less susceptible to the competitive forces that are likely causing the changes in the private sector. It seems clear that more recent cohorts of workers are less likely than their parents to have a career characterized by a “life-time ” job with a single employer...|$|R

25|$|Labour law in {{its modern}} form is {{primarily}} a creation {{of the last three}} decades of the 20th century. However, as a system of regulating the <b>employment</b> <b>relationship,</b> labour law has existed since people worked. In feudal England, the first significant labour laws followed the Black Death. Given the shortage of workers and consequent price rises the Ordinance of Labourers 1349 and the Statute of Labourers 1351 attempted to suppress sources of wage inflation by banning workers organisation, creating offences for any able-bodied person that did not work, and fixing wages at pre-plague levels. Ultimately this led to the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, which was in turn suppressed and followed up with the Statute of Cambridge 1388, which banned workers from moving around the country. Yet conditions were improving as serfdom was breaking down. One sign {{was the beginning of the}} more enlightened Truck Acts, dating from 1464, that required that workers be paid in cash and not kind. In 1772 slavery was declared to be illegal in R v Knowles, ex parte Somersett, and the subsequent Slave Trade Act 1807 and Slavery Abolition Act 1833 enforced prohibition throughout the British Empire. The turn into the 19th century coincided with the start of the massive boom in production. Gradually people's relationship to their employers moved from one of status - formal subordination and deference - to contract whereby people were formally free to choose their work. However, freedom of contract did not, as the economist Adam Smith observed, change a worker's factual dependency on employers.|$|E

2500|$|At-will {{employment}} {{is a term}} used in U.S. labor law for contractual relationships in which an employee can be dismissed by an employer for any reason (that is, without having to establish [...] "just cause" [...] for termination), and without warning.

2500|$|Some {{state and}} federal laws presume workers who {{are not covered by}} a {{collective}} bargaining agreement or an individual employment agreement have [...] "at-will employment". This is a policy that employees' may be dismissed without notice and for no stated reason. However {{state and federal}} laws prohibiting discrimination or protecting the right to organize or engage in whistleblowing activities modify that rule by providing that discharge or other forms of discrimination are illegal if undertaken on grounds specifically prohibited by law. An <b>employment</b> <b>relationship</b> could be terminated by either party at any time without a reason. Starting in 1941, a series of laws prohibited certain discriminatory firings. That is, in most states, absent an express contractual provision to the contrary, an employer can still fire an employee for no or any reason, {{as long as it is}} not a reason in violation of public policy.|$|E
2500|$|The implied-contract {{theory to}} {{circumvent}} at-will employment {{must be treated}} with caution. [...] In 2006, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Matagorda County Hospital District v. Burwell held that a provision in an employee handbook stating that dismissal may be for cause, and requiring employee records to specify the reason for termination, did not modify an employee's at-will employment. The New York Court of Appeals, that state’s highest court, also rejected the implied-contract theory to circumvent employment at will. [...] In Anthony Lobosco, Appellant v. New York Telephone Company/NYNEX, Respondent, the court restated the prevailing rule that an employee could not maintain an action for wrongful discharge where state law recognized neither the tort of wrongful discharge, nor exceptions for firings that violate public policy, and an employee's explicit employee handbook disclaimer preserved the at-will <b>employment</b> <b>relationship.</b> [...] And in the same 2000 decision mentioned above, the Supreme Court of California held that the length of an employee's long and successful service, standing alone, is not evidence {{in and of itself}} of an implied-in-fact contract not to terminate except for cause.|$|E
2500|$|Contracts between {{employees}} and employers (mostly corporations) usually begin an <b>employment</b> <b>relationship,</b> but {{are often not}} enough for a decent livelihood. Because individuals lack bargaining power, especially against wealthy corporations, labor law creates rights that override unjust market outcomes. Historically, the law rigidly enforced property rights and [...] "freedom of contract" [...] on any terms, even if this was inefficient, exploitative and unjust. In the early 20th century, as more people favored the introduction of democratically determined economic and social rights over rights of property and contract in unequal markets, {{state and federal governments}} introduced law reform. First, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 created a minimum wage (now $7.25 at federal level, higher in 28 states) and overtime pay of one and a half times. Second, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 creates very limited rights to take unpaid leave. In practice, good employment contracts improve on these minimums. Third, while there is no right to an occupational pension or other benefits, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ensures employers guarantee those benefits if they are promised. Fourth, the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1970 demands a safe system of work, backed by professional inspectors. Individual states are often empowered to go beyond the federal minimum, and function as laboratories of democracy in social and economic rights, where they have not been constrained by the US Supreme Court.|$|E
