She reveals that her mother didn't like her, since she thought that she had sex with her father. She realizes that Mary Jane is just like her mother, in that neither one of them listens to her. Her mother refused to believe Rowena when she told her she didn't have sex with her father. Then, she remembers that she left Mary Jane home alone, so she leaves. Unfortunately she had dropped an {{unfinished}} cigarette <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ashtray,</b> and an open window blows it over, resulting in a fire. The neighbors (Fritzi Burr and Warren Munson) spot the fire in time and call 9-1-1. Mary Jane is taken to the hospital to check on smoke inhalation, and Rowena is arrested for child endangerment. When Mary Jane arrives at the hospital, Dr. Buccieri calls Dr. Helgerson and informs him of what happened. This time, he becomes more involved, ordering a set of full-skeletal x-rays. Dr. Buccieri tries again to talk to Mary Jane, who has become mute, giving her a china doll and tells the child how, when she was young, she used to talk to her doll about her abusive parents.

Michael becomes furious of Dean's interruption and confronts him just as Castiel (Misha Collins) and Bobby (Jim Beaver) arrive. Castiel throws a Molotov cocktail of Holy Oil on Michael, forcing him to temporarily vanish. Lucifer, outraged at Castiel's action, blows him up with a snap of his fingers. In a last ditch effort, Bobby shoots Lucifer to distract him from Dean. Annoyed, Lucifer snaps Bobby's neck. Dean repeatedly appeals to Sam to overpower Lucifer, who responds by severely beating him until he is barely conscious. However, as he presses Dean {{against the side of the}} Impala, ready to deliver another blow, he pauses as he catches sight of a plastic army man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ashtray</b> of one of its doors. This triggers memories of Sam's childhood and various warm moments with Dean, which allow Sam to finally overpower Lucifer. He then opens the cage with the Horsemen's rings, when Michael suddenly returns. He says that he will not let it end the way Sam wants it to and charges at him. Sam, now in control, pulls Michael with him into the cage and the portal closes. Castiel then reappears and tells Dean he was resurrected by God and promoted.

5000|$|The video, {{which had}} {{moderate}} rotation on MTV (as {{opposed to the}} band's singles from their Business as Usual album), told a satirical story of the outbreak of a war between the Eastern and Western blocs. The beginning of the video shows the five band members dressed as children playing [...] "soldiers" [...] and being invited into an officer's tent by an American officer, inside of which are many allied officers of various services drinking and partying. The video then shows four adult men whom are working each as a businessman, a road worker, an anti war protester and a doctor.

We then see them walking through a burnt out forest and come across an elderly man, who beats {{one of the soldiers}} with an umbrella, one of the soldiers takes aim but upon realizing what is happening lowers his weapon. The latter of the video is mostly set in an underground bunker or [...] "War Room" [...] similar to the NORAD facility of Cheyenne Mountain, and the band seemed to engage in a semi-retelling of the 1964 black comedy Dr. Strangelove.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{an explanation}} and {{a solution to}} the increasing problem that cigarette butts cause <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets of Copenhagen. Research shows that over three billion cigarette butts are tossed on <b>the</b> ground <b>in</b> Denmark every year. This makes cigarette butts the most tossed type of litter with 43 percent. We cooperated with the Copenhagen Municipality and the waste collectors throughout the entire project, to obtain the knowledge that they possessed and to evaluate the results we obtained from our ongoing observations. Furthermore the Copenhagen Municipality recommended focusing on cigarette butts at bus stops as they are the hardest hit places, to which we agreed. We used structuralized quantitative observations containing qualitative aspects to obtain data from the smokersâ different kinds of behavior at bus stops. The results indicated that approximately 1 in 10 smokers would toss their cigarette butt in a trashcan or an <b>ashtray.</b> <b>The</b> results also allowed us to divide the different kinds of smokers into four categories, so-called archetypes. We made new observations to find which archetype was the most dominant. This proved to be âthe unconsciousâ smoker, which represented over 80 percent of the observed smokers. Our focus was primarily directed towards reducing the amount of cigarette butts tossed on the ground by âthe unconsciousâ smokers. In order to do so, we analyzed their behavior and determined which characteristics they had in common. We used the theory of nudge presented by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein as our primary theory and as the most important element in our project. We decided {{to make use of the}} libertarian paternalistic nudge â a nudge that while allowing you to choose freely, tries to lead you towards the option that is best for you. Acquainted with the ways of doing a libertarian paternalistic nudge and the common characteristics of âthe unconsciousâ smoker, we began constructing and testing prototypes of <b>ashtrays.</b> <b>The</b> first prototype resulted in an increase from 11 percent to 65 percent of total cigarette butts tossed therein. In order to pinpoint the nudging characteristics we had to create a second prototype. This prototype had some key elements changed which led us to the hypothesis that the prototype would generate a different result. The result, however, turned out to vary by only one percent from our observation of the first prototype. This led us to the conclusion that the actual nudge is not caused as much by the appearance and features of <b>the</b> <b>ashtray,</b> as it is the placement and the fact that it is a thing of its own and not physically connected to a trashcan. Although the visual appeal of <b>the</b> <b>ashtray</b> is less important than we originally thought, we can conclude that the aesthetics are greatly important <b>in</b> <b>the</b> noticeability and therefore effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>ashtray...</b>|$|R

2500|$|In July 1975, a {{base model}} called the 2CV SpÃ©cial was {{introduced}} with the 435cc engine.

40|$|This project {{concerns}} {{an explanation}} of the problem of cigarette butts lying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets of Copenhagen. By using elements of the theory of nudging we have designed an ashtray ment to pledge smokers not to throw their butt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets. The design is a response to a design competition published by the municipality of Copenhagen, as an attempt to be <b>the</b> cleanest capital <b>in</b> Europe by <b>the</b> year 2015. The core of the design presentation is in cooperation with private firms, who have obligated themselves to donate money to charity. The amount of money will be dependent on the number of cigarette butts collected. We have used the theory of nudging by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein to create a playful tone around the taboo subject of littering. This theory presents some guidelines to give people a friendly push <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most optimal direction within the topics: Health, wealth and happiness. To gain a deeper understanding to the fundamental ideas of nudging, we have used Langdon Winners theory of artefacts as a social, cultural and political player as an opponent to Thaler and Sunsteins arguments in order to debate the theory of nudging. The Cradle-to-cradle principle is a vision of complete restoration of materials, so new material expansion is limited to the very minimum. We have used cradle-to-cradle in our design, which is built out of durable materials in order to minimize the need to restore <b>the</b> <b>ashtray.</b> <b>The</b> materials we wanted to use to create <b>the</b> <b>ashtray</b> are also possible to gain out of recycled materials. We used observations of <b>the</b> urban life <b>in</b> Copenhagen to determine which part of the city would be optimal to place <b>the</b> astray; later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process we observed this chosen space, and the present crowd that constituted our audience. We set up an interview with a select group of people we invited that fit the demographic of our audience. This group discussed our design, our visions for the project and their general understanding of cigarette butts, littering and smoking. As a result of this research process, we discovered that the problem of cigarette butts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street is not contingent on <b>the</b> lack of <b>ashtrays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city: rather, <b>the</b> number of <b>ashtrays</b> should be sufficient if the smokersâ attention is concentrated on locating them. Furthermore, we found that a change of the smokers mentality about littering is the main issue behind the problem. An efficient place to start is to inform smokers of the resources spent on cleaning litter as well as the negative effect that cigarette butts have on the city environment: aesthetically and as a detriment to oneâs health. Our research confirmed our hypothesis that designing an welcoming ashtray as part of Copenhagenâs campaign {{is the best way to}} address the problem. Since the campaign âStÃ¸t med dit skodâ, tries to enlighten the public of the problem of throwing cigarette butts and hoping this knowledge will change many smokers behavior. In conclusion we found that the possibility to âdonateâ your cigarette butt to help collect donation to charity, is a strong motivation that would help many smokers to change their habits...|$|R

25|$|The 1978 {{model year}} VAM Pacers gained new hood and grille designs, which in Mexico {{were just a}} {{facelift}} {{due to the lack}} of a V8 engine. The only technical difference of the year was the replacement of the Holley 2300 carburetor in favor of a Motorcraft 2150 unit with a built-in altitude compensator despite having a slightly lower flow. This took away a small amount of power but allowed easier passing of emission certification and was more reliable in changing altitudes. New standard features included a hood light, a speedometer in both kilometers and miles per hour, door panels including a vertical stripe pattern over their top edges, a different AM/FM radio model, a new flat-faced luxury steering wheel design with an AMC logo, and new seat designs. The heater was improved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of air vents appearing to the left of the instrument cluster, the center of the dashboard above <b>the</b> <b>ashtray</b> and over <b>the</b> top right corner of the glovebox door regardless of the presence of the air conditioning system.
