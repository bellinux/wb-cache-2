40|$|Raw laser {{scanning}} data are captured and supplied as 3 D points. These point data require an appropriate interpolation function {{to be applied}} to them in order to represent a continuous height surface. Many software packages require that points be interpolated onto a regular grid, in order that the resultant surfaces can be displayed as a Digital Surface Model (DSM). Such interpolation procedures introduce error across the surface, and these errors will be accommodated by any subsequent analysis on the DSM, such as image segmentation or feature extraction. Whilst it is generally understood that interpolation introduces error, there is a paucity of information regarding the characteristics of the errors created using different methodologies.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{interferometric}} capabilities of current and future SAR systems, like ENVISAT, RADARSAT- 2, etc. The authors introduce a technique to obtain interferometric surveys by combining two images, coming from any SAR mode, together with a <b>digital</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>mode</b> (DEM). The DEM is exploited during the interferogram generation to provide, at one time, effective noise removal and compensation for the topographic-dependent fringes. The final product is a 'differential' (topography-compensated) interferogram {{to be used for}} monitoring over landslides, upswelling, etc. An innovative technique is also discussed to estimate local coherence maps, to be used for classification and change detection. Such a technique exploits windows whose shapes and sizes adapt locally to the target features, to attain at one time the highest resolution and the best statistical confidence.

Rapid industrialization and urbanization has resulted in extensive changes in land use, including the tidal flat reclamation and harbor construction. For the analysis of the morphological changes of the Dachan Bay, multi-temporal Landsat images have been digitized by using the integrated RS and GIS technique, and the <b>digital</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>modes</b> in different years were set up in combination with topographical and nautical data. From the change analysis, it can be concluded that the sea area of the Dachan Bay decreases to 6. 0 km 2, by 87. 6 % between 1907 a and 2011 a due to the large-scale tidal flat reclamation, and the maximum downcutting depth of the seabed in the entrance area is over 10 m mainly caused by extensive harbor construction. Based on the research of the morphological change in recent decades, it is suggested that the human activities have become one of the major factors affecting the morphological processes of the Dachan Bay...|$|R
40|$|The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) acquires hydrographic data {{around the}} coasts of the US and its territories using {{in-house}} surveys and contracting resources. Hydrographic data are primarily collected using sonar systems, while a small percent is acquired via Airborne Lidar Bathymetry (ALB) for nearshore areas. NOAA has an ongoing requirement, as per the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act of 1947, to survey nearshore areas {{as part of its}} coastal mapping activities, including updating nautical charts, creating hydrodynamic models and supporting coastal planning and habitat mapping. NOAA has initiated a project to investigate the potential use of ALB data from non-hydrographic survey programmes (i. e., programmes designed to support objectives other than nautical charting and with specifications and requirements that differ from those of NOAA hydrographic surveys) in order {{to increase the amount of}} data available to meet these nearshore mapping requirements. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN evaluation of ALB data from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) National Coastal Mapping Program (NCMP) for use by NOAA’s Offi ce of Coast Survey (OCS). Th ese NCMP datasets were evaluated through a statistical comparison to bathymetric surfaces derived from hydrographic NOAA surveys.

40|$|Due to the SAR 1 {{geometry}} imaging, SAR images include geometric distortions {{that would}} be erroneous image information and the images should be geometrically calibrated. As the radar systems are side looking, geometric distortion such as shadow, foreshortening and layover are occurred. To compensate these geometric distortions, information about sensor position, imaging geometry and target altitude from ellipsoid should be available. In this paper, a method for geometric calibration of SAR images is proposed. The method uses Range-Doppler equations. In this method, for the image georeferencing, the DEM 2 of SRTM with 30 m pixel size is used and also exact ephemeris data of the sensor is required. In the algorithm proposed in this paper, first digital elevation model transmit to range and azimuth direction. By applying this process, errors caused by topography such as foreshortening and layover are removed in the transferred DEM. Then, {{the position of the}} corners on original image is found base on the transferred DEM. Next, original image registered to transfer DEM by 8 parameters projective transformation. The output is the georeferenced image that its geometric distortions are removed. The advantage of the method described in this article {{is that it does not}} require any control point as well as the need to attitude and rotational parameters of the sensor. Since the ground range resolution of used images are about 30 m, the geocoded images using the method described in this paper have an accuracy about 20 m (subpixel) in planimetry and about 30 m in altimetry. 1 Synthetic Aperture Radar 2 <b>Digital</b> <b>Elevation</b> <b>Mode...</b>|$|E
40|$|Wide climatic {{variability}} is characteristic for {{large parts of}} China including events of extreme anomalies. This paper presents a time series covering the period 1958 to 1988 for monthly temperature and precipitation in China for a 5 x 5 km grid cell size. Monthly station histories (265 for temperature and 310 for rainfall), long-term averages of mean monthly temperature and rainfall on a 5 km grid, and a <b>digital</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>mode</b> (DEM) are the input data used to build the time series data base. Individual station anomalies in terms of deviation from the 31 -year average were calculated and interpolated throughout China using the Mollifier interpolation technique. It uses a statistical approach to non-parametric interpolation. As a result data is available for monthly anomaly surfaces for all the years. By linking these to the long-term average grid maps we derive a time series of temperature and rainfall for China. Maps were produced for anomalies, and for absolute temperature and precipitation in each year between 1958 and 1988. Along with maps indicating variability at the stations, others have been completed based on the interpolated time series. Due to surface smoothing of the interpolation the variability of the interpolated time series is usually lower than the one based upon station observations. Temperature variability is quite low during the summer half. Anomalies are mostly less than 2 C in nearly all of China. During the winter months the anomaly increases up to 6 C with the highest variability in modern China and on the plateau. the pattern of monthly anomalies is stable in that relatively large areas show the same trend of deviation. Variability of rainfall shows large differences in spatial and temporal terms. Rainfall variability is highest during winter when rainfall is low. Especially the monthly data offer a comprehensive insight into seasonal differences in regional rainfall variability. In northern China's agricultural productive areas variability is high during the spring months, decreases in summer and increases as of September. In the middle and lower reaches of the Changjiang river basin variability is high in July and August amounting {{to as much as}} over 50 %. Variability is relatively low in Southwest China, which includes the fertile Sichuan basin. Also in China's northeastern agricultural areas variability is relatively low during the growing season. From a policy point of view it is also of interest to aggregate the data for certain geographic regions. Results for provinces and major watersheds are presented. The interpolated surfaces are validated by comparing them with the station observations available in this study. Anomaly surfaces validation is determined by the interpolation error. There is a good fit for temperature anomaly surfaces compared to observed station anomalies. Because of the high spatial variability of rainfall anomalies including the possibility of extreme events in selected stations, interpolated anomalies are usually reduced during the interpolation. The temperature and rainfall time series validation is, in addition by the interpolation error, influenced by the differences in the 31 -year average observed at the stations and the average presented in the long-term average grids to which the anomaly surfaces are linked. ...|$|E
