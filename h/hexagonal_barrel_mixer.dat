50|$|The Whitworth rifle {{was arguably}} the first {{long-range}} sniper rifle in the world. Designed by Sir Joseph Whitworth, a prominent British engineer, it used twisted <b>hexagonal</b> <b>barrels</b> instead of traditional round rifled barrels, {{which meant that}} the projectile {{did not have to}} bite into grooves as was done with conventional rifling. His rifle was far more accurate than the Pattern 1853 Enfield, which had shown some weaknesses during the recent Crimean War. At trials in 1857, which tested the accuracy and range of both weapons, Whitworth's design outperformed the Enfield {{at a rate of about}} three to one. Also, the Whitworth rifle was able to hit the target at a range of 2,000 yards, whereas the Enfield could only manage it at a distance of 1,400 yards.|$|R

50|$|The {{principle}} of the polygonal barrel was proposed in 1853 by Sir Joseph Whitworth, a prominent British engineer and entrepreneur. Whitworth experimented with cannons using twisted <b>hexagonal</b> <b>barrels</b> instead of traditional round rifled barrels, which was patented in 1854. In 1856, this concept was demonstrated {{in a series of}} experiments using brass howitzers. The British military, however, rejected Whitworth's polygonal rifled designs. Whitworth believed that polygonal rifling could be used to create a more accurate rifled musket to replace the Pattern 1853 Enfield. During the American Civil War, Whitworth's polygonal rifled Whitworth rifle was successfully used by the Confederate States Army Whitworth Sharpshooters. The Whitworth rifle is often called the 'sharpshooter' because of its accuracy compared to other rifled muskets of its era (far surpassing the Sharps), and {{is considered one of the}} earliest examples of a sniper rifle. The last common rifles to use polygonal rifling were the Lee-Metford rifle, named after the Metford rifling, and the Arisaka rifles designed by Col. Arisaka. The switch to cordite from black powder proved too much for the shallow rifling in the relatively soft barrels of the Metford, and the Lee-Metford became the Lee-Enfield when the Metford rifling was dropped. However, Arisakas were manufactured until the surrender of the Imperial Japanese Army in 1945; it has been proven that Arisaka rifling was more durable, and the accuracy of many captured rifles can attest to this.|$|R
40|$|The Saltstone Production Facility has a 10 -inch Readco-Kurimoto {{continuous}} mixer that mixes the premix dry feeds and low-level waste salt solution to make fresh (uncured) saltstone. Inspection of the mixer in January 2013 showed significant wear on the third, {{fourth and fifth}} paddle pairs after the conveying augers. A 2 -inch Readco-Kurimoto {{continuous mixer}} {{was used to test}} alternate paddle configurations for use in the 10 -inch mixer to decrease the wear rate on the paddles. Two wear tests were conducted to investigate a method of reducing wear on the mixer paddles. The first test (wear test 2 a) had a paddle configuration similar to the currently installed 10 -inch mixer in the SPF. This test established baseline wear. The second test (wear test 2 b) had a reconfigured paddle arrangement that replaced the flat paddles with helical paddles for paddle pairs 2 � 6 and aligned paddle pair 1 with the augers. The intent of the reconfiguration was to more effectively convey the partially wetted dry feeds through the transition region and into the liquid feed where paddle wear is reduced due to dry feeds and salt solution being mixed at the intended water to premix ratio. The design of the helical paddles provides conveyance through the transition region to the liquid feed inlet. The alignment with the auger is aimed to provide a smoother transition (minimizing the discontinuity between the auger and paddle pair 1) into the downstream paddles. A soft metal with low wear resistance (6000 series aluminum) was used for the wear testing paddles to determine wear patterns while minimizing run time and maximizing wear rate. For the two paddle configurations tested using the scaled 2 -inch Readco-Kurimoto continuous mixer, with the first six paddles after the augers replaced by the wear paddles and the remaining paddles were stainless steel. Since the 10 -inch SPF mixer is designed with the liquid inlet centered over paddle pairs 5 and 6, the scaled 2 -inch mixer was configured the same way. The wear rate from wear test 2 a was approximately double the wear rate from wear test 2 b for paddle pairs 4 and 5. For both configurations, there was little or no wear on paddle pairs 1, 2, 3 and 6 based on mass change, indicating that the un-wetted and fully wetted premix materials cause less wear than the partially wetted premix. Additionally, inspection of the wear surface of the paddles showed more deformation on the flat paddles than the helical paddles which was consistent with the wear rates. Aligning of the auger discharge flight with paddle pair 1 resulted in a lower wear rate paddle pair 1 rather than having them misaligned with the feed augers. During the paddle wear tests, polishing wear was observed on the inside <b>barrel</b> of the <b>mixer.</b> The polishing wear is evident on the upper housing clamshell and the lower housing clamshell primarily at paddle pairs 4 and 5, which is the transition region of the mixer. Wear on the <b>mixer</b> <b>barrel</b> increases the space between the paddles and the barrel, resulting in increased grout build up on the <b>barrel.</b> Since the <b>mixer</b> <b>barrel</b> cannot be reconfigured or replaced in the SPF, the method for mitigating wear on the barrel is to move the more viscous grout through the transition region as quickly as possible. In addition, the location of the liquid inlet does not allow for sufficient cleaning of the mixer since residual grout remains on paddle pairs 1 � 4. As the paddles continue to wear and the self-cleaning capability of the paddles is lost, the lack of sufficient flushing would aid in grout build up between the barrel and the paddles which could eventually lead to decreased throughput capacity of the dry feeds. Changing the paddle configuration from flat to helical resulted in no change to the rheological properties of the grout mixture. Both tests produced a grout that is within the processing range of the SPF. Based on the results of this testing, it is recommended for the currently installed SPF mixer that paddle pairs 1 through 6 be helical rather than flat, with the paddle pair 1 aligned with the feed augers in order to minimize the wear occurring in the SPF mixer. Based on the results of this testing, it is recommended that the mixer be inspected and critical measurements be taken whenever the SPF processing schedule allows in order to establish a wear rate of the 10 -inch mixer paddles. 5 Based on these measurements, the lifetime of paddles in the transition region can be established in order to set up a maintenance schedule for the mixer. Since replacing the entire mixer is very expensive and time intensive, replacing the worn paddles after a specific time period would allow for planned shutdowns as well as process optimization such that the mixer throughput is not compromised. In addition, further testing should be performed to determine an alternate liquid inlet location to better flush the mixer of residual grout at the end of processing. Sufficiently cleaning the mixer will help eliminate another potential source of wear. Another potential method for reducing the wear rate in the mixer is to reduce the mixer speed without affecting the throughput capacity. Since wear rate is a function of impact velocity of the grout and mixing paddles, testing could be done using the 2 -inch mixer determine the optimum mixer speed to reduce wear but not adversely impact facility operations (e. g. throughput capacity and grout properties) ...|$|R
40|$|Hot mix asphalt {{recycling}} {{has become}} common practice {{all over the}} world since the 1970 s because of the crisis in oil prices. In the Netherlands, hot recycling has advanced {{to such an extent that}} in most of the mixtures more than 50 % of reclaimed asphalt (RA) is allowed. These mixtures with such a high RA content are produced in a batch plant to which a parallel drum is attached. In this drum RA is pre-heated to approximately 130 °C. Since 2007 another hot mix recycling techniques became available in which RA is mixed in cold and moist condition in contrary to conventional methods. It is a so called double <b>barrel</b> drum <b>mixer.</b> In this method virgin aggregates are superheated in the inner drum and mixed with cool and moist RA and fines and virgin bitumen in the outer drum. In both cases, double drum and partial heating methods, the virgin aggregates have to be pre-heated to higher temperatures than with mixtures without RA in order to achieve a mixing temperature of around 170 °C. Dependent on RA amount, moisture, pre-heating, etc. in the batch plant the virgin aggregates have to be pre-heated to around 300 ° C and in the double barrel drum to around 500 °C. These high temperatures have led to concerns about the quality of the produced mixtures. Since 2008, a new Dutch specification system for asphalt mixtures is in place in line with the European standards (EN 13108 series). The new regulation gives contractors freedom to select their own material such as bitumen grade and the amount of recycling; however, in return it makes them responsible for the quality of the mixture. The mixture should fulfill the requirement of fundamental performance characteristics of the mixtures such as resistance to fatigue and permanent deformation. In this research two major questions have been investigated. One of the questions is whether these high temperatures have a negative effect on the bituminous binder, while the other important question is whether the RA binder will blend totally with the virgin binder that is added. The focus of this research was on four objectives. The first objective was to develop a laboratory mixing method to simulate the real recycling process in the field. The second objective was to assess the effect of the double barrel drum on the mixture quality in comparison with conventional batch plant. Third, it was aimed to measure the blending degree between two binders. And finally, to increase the understanding of the mechanism behind blending RA binders with virgin bitumen, with focus on their micro structure. To cover all research topics, this dissertation is organized in two parts in which the first part is devoted to laboratory and field mixture evaluation while the second part is presenting the exploratory research on the fundamental aspects of blending. Research in part 1 is conducted in two phases, laboratory simulation and field experimentation. The conventional partial warming recycling method (PW) the upgraded double drum mixing method (UPG) were simulated in the lab and the quality of mixtures were compared with the standard mixing method (SM) in the lab at different RA content and different moisture content. This research showed that higher percentages of RA results in higher stiffness and lower fatigue life. However in the UPG method with 4 % moisture and 60 % RA, the mixture became remarkably lower in stiffness and durable against fatigue. This might be because of the lack of blending or the effect of foaming of bitumen. It was concluded that the UPG method could not effectively be simulated in the lab. In the next experimental phase of the study, three identical mixtures were produced with 50 % RA and 4. 3 % bitumen. One mixture was produced in a batch plant (BB) while the second one was mixed using a double drum mixer by the same contractor (A). The third mixture was produced in the laboratory (L) using a lab pugmill mixer. The comparison between three mixtures shows that mixture L has a higher stiffness than A and BB. Mixture BB has as slightly higher stiffness than A. Furthermore, mixture A has the lowest stiffness which is most probably due to the system of cold and moist RA feeding into the double drum system. Besides the 4 PB fatigue and stiffness test, monotonic uniaxial tension (UT) and compression (UC) tests were performed to be used in material modeling and to determine a fatigue endurance limit. The limit value of the stress ratio parameter (Rlimit) was determined which is useful in the determination of the endurance limit in a three-dimensional state. It shows that different mixing methods lead to different endurance limits. It turns out that the plant produced mixture has a higher endurance limit than the laboratory mixture. In this research an infrared thermography method was used in every material preparation stage. The temperature homogeneity of the mixtures in the lab and in the field was investigated. It proved to be a useful method in visualizing the temperature exchange during mixing and compaction. In Part 2, the effect of superheating aggregates is studied by simulating RA and real aggregates with glass beads and artificial aged binder. The stage extraction method was evaluated in this research with respect to size and shape of aggregates. The blending and diffusion mechanism between old and new bitumen is studied at the microstructure level by means of Nano indention and Nano-CT scanning. The morphology of different types of bitumen was detectable by these techniques; however the blending zone couldn’t be characterized. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
