5|$|Letcher {{enrolled}} in Joshua Fry's private academy near Danville, Kentucky, faring better under Fry's instruction {{than he had}} in the common schools, and gained a sound education. Following his <b>instruction</b> <b>at</b> Fry's academy, he returned to his father's brickyard, where tradition holds that he helped build the state's first governor's mansion alongside future governor Thomas Metcalfe. He then read law in the office of Humphrey Marshall, was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in Lancaster, Kentucky. He briefly served as a judge advocate in Colonel John Allen's volunteer militia during the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September 1940, Foskett {{enlisted in}} the Royal Australian Air Force for service during the Second World War. Accepted for flight {{training}} under the Empire Air Training Scheme, he received his initial flight <b>instruction</b> <b>at</b> No.2 Initial Training School, Bradfield Park. Completing this course on 9 November, Foskett was advanced to leading aircraftman and posted to No.2 Embarkation Depot. On 10 December, he embarked from Sydney bound for Africa.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneous {{multithreading}} (of which Intel's Hyper-Threading is {{the best}} known) was an early form of pseudo-multi-coreism. A processor capable of simultaneous multithreading includes multiple execution units in the same processing unit—that is it has a superscalar architecture—and can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from multiple threads. Temporal multithreading {{on the other hand}} includes a single execution unit in the same processing unit and can issue one <b>instruction</b> <b>at</b> a time from multiple threads.|$|E

5|$|Even as a boy, Frank {{had wanted}} to become a pilot. World War II had begun on 1 September 1939 and he volunteered for {{military}} service in the Luftwaffe. Following his basic military training, he took flying <b>instruction</b> <b>at</b> the pilot school in Zeltweg. Here he qualified to fly the Bücker Bü 131, Bü 133 and Bü 181, the Klemm Kl 35, the Arado Ar 66, Ar 68 and Ar 96, the Focke-Wulf Fw 58, and the Junkers W 34 and Junkers Ju 52. In October 1940 he transferred to Nachtjagdschule 1 (1st Night Fighter School) at Schleißheim near Munich, formerly the Zerstörerschule 1 (ZS 1—1st Destroyer School). There he specialized as a night fighter pilot in the 2nd Squadron under the command of Staffelkapitän (squadron leader) Oberleutnant (First Lieutenant) Günther Specht.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{maintains}} {{close ties}} to the industrial world. Many of these connections are made through Georgia Tech's cooperative education and internship programs. Georgia Tech's Division of Professional Practice (DoPP), established in 1912 as the Georgia Institute of Technology Cooperative Division, operates the largest and fourth-oldest cooperative education program in the United States, and is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Cooperative Education. The DoPP is charged with providing opportunities for students to gain real-world employment experience through four programs, each targeting a different body of students. The Undergraduate Cooperative Education Program is a five-year program in which undergraduate students alternate between semesters of formal <b>instruction</b> <b>at</b> Georgia Tech and semesters of full-time employment with their employers.|$|E

5|$|Hancock {{was born}} on 31May 1907 in Perth, Western Australia, and educated at Hale School in Wembley Downs. He was the elder cousin of future mining magnate Lang Hancock. Val Hancock entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1925 and {{graduated}} as senior cadet in 1928, earning the Sword of Honour. His preferred career path in the military was engineering, {{and it was only}} when he found that there was no vacancy in his corps of choice, and that he had instead been earmarked for the artillery, that he put his name forward for transfer to the Royal Australian Air Force. He enlisted in the RAAF on 1February 1929, and undertook flying <b>instruction</b> <b>at</b> RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, later that year.|$|E
5|$|Hubbard's career {{included}} {{a number of}} routine assignments including: assistant paymaster for the submarine tender USS Rainbow in 1918; supply officer for the aircraft tender USS Aroostook (1919-1920) (during Hubbard's assignment to Aroostook she provided support to the historic NC-4 transatlantic flight); assistant supply officer for the battleship USS Oklahoma (1921-1923); under <b>instruction</b> <b>at</b> the School of Application of the Bureau of Supply and Accounts in Washington, D.C. (1923-1924); disbursing officer at the Puget Sound Navy Yard (1924-1927); officer {{in charge of the}} commissary at Naval Station Guam (1927-1929); disbursing officer Naval Hospital, Washington, D.C. (1927-1929); assistant supply officer, Puget Sound Navy Yard (1935-1938); and supply officer of the cruiser USS Astoria (1938-1941).|$|E
5|$|In {{later years}} Warner said he regretted his {{decision}} to leave Stanford for Temple, and left because of concern about the school's changing funding priorities. The university leadership was planning to make Stanford primarily a graduate school; because {{of an increase in}} the number of junior colleges in California, the administration saw less need for undergraduate <b>instruction</b> <b>at</b> Stanford. Because fewer students were admitted, higher grade requirements for incoming students made admission more difficult and student athletes began enrolling at USC and California instead of Stanford. Warner soon realized that he had made the wrong decision; due to the economic effects of the Great Depression, the number of applicants to Stanford decreased significantly and athletes were again admitted. Temple upset the Florida Gators, coached by future Temple coach Josh Cody, 20–12 in Warner's last game.|$|E

5|$|Malley {{joined the}} Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 12October 1915. He {{departed}} Melbourne for Egypt as a gunner with reinforcements of the 1st Field Artillery Brigade aboard HMAT Wandilla on 9November. In March 1916, he was posted to the Western Front in France, and joined his unit in May. The 1st Brigade {{took part in}} the Battles of Pozières and Mouquet Farm in July and August 1916. Malley transferred to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) as a mechanic in April 1917, before undertaking flying <b>instruction</b> <b>at</b> the Oxford University air school.

5|$|No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit (No.2 OCU) is {{a fighter}} {{training}} {{unit of the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Located at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, the unit trains pilots to operate the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, conducts refresher courses for pilots returning to the type, and trains future Hornet instructors. Pilots new to the Hornet enter No.2OCU after first qualifying to fly fast jets at No.79 Squadron and undertaking initial fighter combat <b>instruction</b> <b>at</b> No.76 Squadron. Once qualified on the F/A-18, they are posted to one of No.81 Wing's operational Hornet units, No.3 Squadron, No.75 Squadron or No.77 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1964, the Tri-partite Evaluation Squadron (TES) {{was formed}} at RAF West Raynham, staffed by a diverse mix of {{military}} test pilots from Britain, the United States and West Germany. The personnel comprising the squadron were highly experienced pilots; prior to flying the Kestrel, each received a week's ground training at Bristol's in-house facility and a week's ground <b>instruction</b> <b>at</b> Dunsford {{prior to a}} three-hour flight conversion instructed by Bill Bedford. The purpose of the squadron was to evaluate the suitability of V/STOL aircraft for field operations, compare competing styles and methods of taking off/landing, develop normal flight operating procedures, perform instrument flight assessments, conduct night flight operations, and explore jet-borne maneuvering throughout the Kestrel's flight envelope.|$|E

Airflite was engaged to provide maintenance. On 18November, an instructor was killed when he fell into a Randwick street from a Tiger Moth performing a slow roll after his safety harness broke; {{neither he nor his}} student, who though badly shaken was able to land the plane, were wearing parachutes. One Tiger Moth landed on top of another on 27December; both planes were badly damaged but no-one was killed.|$|E
5|$|The son of Archibald and Maud Turnbull, Peter Turnbull {{was born}} on 9February 1917 in Armidale, New South Wales. After leaving school with an Intermediate Certificate, he was {{employed}} as an electrician in Glen Innes, where his family owned property. In 1938, Turnbull enlisted in the 12/24th Light Horse Regiment, a militia unit. He joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as an air cadet on 16January 1939, and underwent <b>instruction</b> <b>at</b> No.1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria. Graduating on 20October 1939, he was commissioned a pilot officer and assigned to No.3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron, which operated Hawker Demons out of RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales. He was promoted to flying officer on 20April 1940, and posted to the Middle East with his unit on 15July, disembarking at Suez, Egypt, the following month.|$|E
