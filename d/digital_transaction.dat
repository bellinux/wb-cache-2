Offine e-cash systems make it possible for the customer to pay the e-coin to the merchant without any involvement of bank. In online schemes, we require the involvement of the bank. The two most fundamental security features associated with offine scheme is the anonymity and the double spending detection. The proposed scheme maintains both the above features along with unforgeability.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{personal}} identifiable information that people distribute over different online services has grown rapidly and considerably {{over the last}} decades. This has led to increased probabilities for identity theft, profiling and linkability attacks, which can in turn not only result in a threat to people’s personal dignity, finances, and many other aspects of their lives, but also to societies in general. Methods and tools for securing people’s online activities and protecting their privacy on the Internet, so called Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs), are being designed and developed. However, these technologies are often seen by ordinary users as complicated and disruptive of their primary tasks.   In this licentiate thesis, I investigate the usability aspects of three main privacy and security enhancing mechanisms. These mechanisms have the goal of helping and encouraging users to protect their privacy on the Internet as they engage {{in some of the}} steps necessary to complete a <b>digital</b> <b>transaction.</b> The three mechanisms, which have been investigated within the scope of different research projects, comprise of (1) graphical visualizations of service providers’ privacy policies and user-friendly management and matching of users’ privacy preferences “on the fly”, (2) methods for helping users create appropriate mental models of the data minimization property of anonymous credentials, and (3) employing touch-screen biometrics as a method to authenticate users into mobile devices and verify their identities during a <b>digital</b> <b>transaction.</b>   Results from these investigations suggest that these mechanisms can make digital transactions privacy-friendly and secure {{while at the same time}} delivering convenience and usability for ordinary users...|$|E

30|$|There are {{at least}} two basic types of digital platform, of which there are also {{numerous}} hybrid combinations (Evans and Gawer 2016). The first kind, a transaction platform, facilitates exchanges by otherwise fragmented groups of consumers and/or firms. A paradigm example is eBay, which allows huge numbers of individual sellers and buyers located anywhere in the world to find one another with an ease that was previously unimaginable. While digitization has enabled transaction platforms in a growing range of industries, this transactional type of platform is not entirely new. For example, the credit card industry has long provided a viable payment option that merchants will accept, that banks will join by issuing cards and processing transactions, and that cardholders find of value. However, the newer <b>digital</b> <b>transaction</b> platforms present an unprecedented opportunity to accumulate and leverage the knowledge voluntarily shared by its users (Brousseau and Penard 2007).|$|E
40|$|Today <b>digital</b> <b>transaction</b> {{watermarking}} is {{a widely}} accepted mechanism in multimedia security. Copies of one work are distributed with individual watermarks. One major threat on transaction watermarking are collusion attacks. Multiple individualized copies of the work are mixed to produce a counterfeited or undetectable watermark. As a countermeasure so-called collusion secure fingerprint codes have been introduced. These are mathematical codes resistant against collusion attacks, even allowing to identify the attackers involved. The important challenge is to provide fingerprints which are highly reliable and, at the same time, sufficiently compact to be embedded as a watermark according to the payload limit. Approaches that generate probabilistic codewords provide theoretical results for t he average fingerprint. Though, in practice, false alarms only occur at by chance disadvantageously generated fingerprints. This work shows how a correlated generation process can manage these disadvantageously generated fingerprints so as to bound the number of false alarms. This allows us to generate shorter fingerprints while keeping the same security level...|$|E
