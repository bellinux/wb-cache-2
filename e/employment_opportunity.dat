40|$|Title: Comparison of <b>Employment</b> <b>opportunities</b> for {{graduates}} of Physical Education and Sports Programs {{in the job}} market of the Czech Republic Objective: Our study explored the differences in <b>employment</b> <b>opportunities</b> for {{graduates of}} specific faculties. Our aim was to compare <b>employment</b> <b>opportunities</b> of graduates from pedagogical and physical education faculties investigated from various points of view. Methods: Grant GACR 406 / 052670 provided for the sending of 4330 questionnaires (DSTVS) with 17 questions and 1855 were returned answered. We compared study data to create an analysis of <b>Employment</b> <b>opportunities</b> for graduates of Physical Education (PE) and Sports Programs from pedagogical and physical education faculties. Conclusions: The Results confirmed our working hypothesis to a great extent. Analysis showed that the majority of graduates work in schools (55, 1 %), and the next largest group are outside the physical education field (28, 4 %). A majority of them are satisfied in their chosen profession. They have a predominantly positive view of their PE studies.

5|$|Green {{worked as}} a solo {{practitioner}} until March 1952, when he entered into a partnership with Harvey Schmidt. The firm was known as Schmidt and Green until 1954, when Doris M. Harris and A. Leon Higginbotham joined as partners. In 1955 J. Austin Norris, a prominent African-American political figure, joined the firm, which was then known as Norris, Schmidt, Green, Harris, & Higginbotham. The firm was the first African-American law firm in Philadelphia. The firm, which never numbered {{more than a dozen}} lawyers at a given time, produced four federal judges; Higginbotham, Green, and Herbert Hutton all served on the District Court (Higginbotham was later elevated to the Third Circuit), and William Hall was the first African American appointed as a federal magistrate judge.

In the 1980s, working with Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters on audio tape that Robert transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and became a best-seller. The publication of the book brought {{a new wave of}} protest about Feynman's attitude toward women. There had been protests over his alleged sexism in 1968, and again in 1972. It did not help that Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired as Caltech's first female professor in 1969, was refused tenure in 1974. She filed suit with the Equal <b>Employment</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Commission, which ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman's colleagues were surprised that he took her side. He had gotten to know her, and both liked and admired her.|$|E
