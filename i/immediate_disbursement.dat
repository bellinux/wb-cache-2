40|$|Carefully {{categorized}} postmortem human {{brains are}} crucial for research. The lack of generally accepted methods for processing human postmortem brains for research persists. Thus, brain banking is essential; however, it cannot be achieved {{at the cost}} of the teaching mission of the academic institution by routing brains away from residency programs, particularly when the autopsy rate is steadily decreasing. A consensus must be reached whereby a brain can be utilizable for diagnosis, research, and teaching. The best diagnostic categorization possible must be secured and the yield of samples for basic investigation maximized. This report focuses on integrated, novel methods currently applied at the New York Brain Bank, Columbia University, New York, which are designed to reach accurate neuropathological diagnosis, optimize the yield of samples, and process fresh-frozen samples suitable {{for a wide range of}} modern investigations. The brains donated for research are processed as soon as possible after death. The prosector must have a good command of the neuroanatomy, neuropathology, and the protocol. One half of each brain is immersed in formalin for performing the thorough neuropathologic evaluation, which is combined with the teaching task. The contralateral half is extensively dissected at the fresh state. The anatomical origin of each sample is recorded using the map of Brodmann for the cortical samples. The samples are frozen at − 160 °C, barcode labeled, and ready for <b>immediate</b> <b>disbursement</b> once categorized diagnostically. A rigorous organization of freezer space, coupled to an electronic tracking system with its attached software, fosters efficient access for retrieval within minutes of any specific frozen samples in storage. This report describes how this achievement is feasible with emphasis on the actual processing of brains donated for research...|$|E

40|$|Summary {{report of}} {{the annual meeting of}} the CGIAR, October 28 to November 1, 1985 in Washington, DC, S. Shahid Husain presiding. The report {{contains}} a few main points of the discussion at a two-day seminar on the impact study, and in Annex II a list of presenters. It was decided to publish the impact study report (see Science and Food, 1988). Center presentations were omitted. The CGIAR Secretariat Science Adviser, Donald Plucknett, presented an overview (Annex IV). Former World Bank President Robert McNamara delivered the first Sir John Crawford Memorial Lecture. The TAC Chairman reported on TAC 37 and 38. In discussing a CDC paper on nutritional concerns in international agricultural research, he encouraged centers to monitor the work of other international organizations in this field. The Chairman of the CBC discussed the roles and membership of boards. The Chairman of the CDC reported on several issues. The Group heard a financial report covering the stabilization mechanism, the special activities account, the finance and budget study, and fund raising. It approved center programs for 1986. The Group spent a full day discussing the TAC paper on strategies and priorities. The CGIAR Chairman appointed a task force on strategic planning to meld the impact study and the priorities paper. After considering the report of its committee on the IBPGR, with active FAO participation, the Group decided that the IBPGR could not function effectively without changes in its status. It strongly urged that such changes be made within the framework of the FAO. Discussion of WARDA focussed on the failure of member states to pay their contributions. The Group supported research on rice production in West Africa, approved the WARDA budget for 1986 for <b>immediate</b> <b>disbursements</b> only, and decided to review WARDA actions at the next meeting. Other annexes are the list of participants, and the Chairman's opening addres...|$|R
