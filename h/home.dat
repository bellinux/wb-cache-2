Elements of the regiment and the 99th Brigade secured the national border in the area. The 1st Guards Brigade advanced towards Kordun, as the Karlovac Corps reoriented its main axis of attack. The 110th <b>Home</b> Guard Regiment and elements of the 104th Brigade reached a largely deserted Vojnić in early afternoon, followed by the 1st Guards Brigade, the 143rd <b>Home</b> Guard Brigade and the 137th <b>Home</b> Guard Regiment.

5|$|A <b>home</b> run {{is a hit}} {{in which}} the player reaches <b>home</b> plate, and scores a run on the same play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this occurs when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory. However, it can occur on a ball hit to the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park <b>home</b> run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, {{and may not be}} fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in <b>home</b> runs is Barry Bonds, who hit 73 <b>home</b> runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds never hit for the cycle. The highest on the list to do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 <b>home</b> runs as of January 16, 2017), who hit for the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E

5|$|As {{the complex}} was being built, and their current <b>home</b> at Yankee Stadium was being renovated, {{they would be}} without a <b>home</b> for three years. Their final full season at Yankee Stadium was 1972. After playing their first two games there in 1973, the Giants played {{the rest of their}} <b>home</b> games in 1973, as well as all of their <b>home</b> games in 1974, at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut. This was done out of a desire to have their own <b>home</b> field, as opposed to having to share Shea Stadium with the Jets. However, between access problems, {{neighborhood}} issues, the fact that the Yale Bowl was not ideally suited for pro football (the stadium did not have lights, nor does it have lights today), the age of the stadium (it was built in 1914) and the lack of modern amenities, the Giants reconsidered their decision and ultimately agreed to share Shea Stadium with the Jets for the 1975 season. The Giants left Yale Bowl after losing all seven <b>home</b> games played at Yale in the 1974 season and compiling a <b>home</b> record of 1–11 over that two-year stretch.|$|E
5|$|Davis's 50th <b>home</b> {{run of the}} season, {{which he}} hit on September 13, tied him with Brady Anderson for the Orioles record of most <b>home</b> runs in a single season. He also became only the third player in MLB history, after Babe Ruth (New York Yankees, 1921) and Albert Belle (Cleveland Indians, 1995), to hit 50 <b>home</b> runs and 40 doubles in a single season. He hit his 51st <b>home</b> run on September 17, setting a new Orioles single season record. This was also his 92nd extra-base hit of the season, again tying Anderson for a {{franchise}} record. He later surpassed that by hitting his first triple of the season against Alex Cobb on September 21 in a 51 loss to Tampa Bay. Davis broke another Orioles record on September 27 with his 28th <b>home</b> run of the season hit at his <b>home</b> park of Camden Yards, surpassing Frank Robinson's record of 27 <b>home</b> runs hit at Memorial Stadium in 1966.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} game of the season, Davis hit his 200th career <b>home</b> run in an Orioles uniform, making him the eighth Oriole in {{franchise}} history to do so. On May 16, {{in a game against}} the Tigers, Davis went 3-5 with three runs scored, four RBIs, two walks, a double and two <b>home</b> runs, including the game winning <b>home</b> run in the 13th inning of the 13-11 victory. Davis became just the 2nd player in MLB history to hit two <b>home</b> runs in the 12th inning or later of a game, joining Matt Adams of the Cardinals. Davis also became the first Orioles player with multiple extra-inning <b>home</b> runs during a single game since Mike Young on May 28, 1987. His four RBIs also moved him past former teammate Brian Roberts for 21st all-time in franchise history. On May 18, Davis hit his 250th career <b>home</b> run (208th as an Oriole). He became the 221st player in MLB history to reach 250 career <b>home</b> runs. He also collected his 738th career hit as an Oriole, moving him into 50th all-time in franchise history. On May 24, he tied Brady Anderson for 7th in franchise history with his 209th career <b>home</b> run as an Oriole.|$|E

This has since been beaten on several occasions. However, since 2011, the majority of <b>home</b> games have been played at the smaller Cardiff City Stadium, the <b>home</b> of Cardiff City.|$|E
