5|$|Vegetables can {{be eaten}} either raw or cooked and play an {{important}} role in human nutrition, being mostly low <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and carbohydrates, but high in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables, five or more portions a day often being recommended.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pig meat is high {{in protein}} and low <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and cholesterol, and is {{described}} as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken. The animal may be served fried (chactado or frito), broiled (asado), or roasted (al horno), and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee. Ecuadorians commonly consume sopa or locro de cuy, a soup dish. Pachamanca or huatia, a process similar to barbecueing, is also popular, and is usually served with corn beer (chicha) in traditional settings.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} known to be toxic to goats; a study {{published}} in the early 1980s revealed that 11 out of 12 goats died after 1 to 40 days of daily oral dosing of Tephrosia apollinea shoots (fresh or dried), and that they displayed adverse reactions to ingesting it such as dyspnoea, weakness of the limbs and joints causing instability in movement, changes <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> composition, catarrhal enteritis, and hemorrhage in the heart, lungs, and intestinal mucosa. Rotenoids extracted from the seeds of the plant also caused complete mortality in Aphis craccivora, when applied at a concentration of 0.1% for 48 hours.|$|E

5|$|When Fat Tony {{finds out}} the Principal Skinner is giving Bart {{detention}} after school, the mobsters go to confront Skinner. The next day, Principal Skinner is missing and {{is presumed to}} have been murdered. Bart has a nightmare of Principal Skinner's ghost and his own execution on the chair. He rushes to confront Fat Tony at the bar. When the police burst <b>in,</b> <b>Fat</b> Tony blames Principal Skinner's disappearance on Bart, who is put on trial. During the trial, Fat Tony, Legs, and Louie lie to the court, saying that Bart is Principal Skinner's murderer {{and the leader of}} the Springfield Mafia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the {{tradition}} of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses are left in the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore {{it is not uncommon for}} bodies to be covered <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.|$|E
5|$|Nursing lasts six {{to eight}} months in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, with the mother {{beginning}} to offer bits of prey at one to two months. The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal nipples is rich <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than {{to that of other}} mustelids. A pup, with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and diving for several weeks before it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored starfish and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at {{six to eight}} months, but a mother may be forced to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it; at the other extreme, a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winter– by one estimate, only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced mothers have the highest survival rates.|$|E

5|$|Obesity {{is mostly}} {{preventable}} {{through a combination}} of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be used, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or length of the intestines, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.|$|E
5|$|Prized as an {{ingredient}} in various foods, B.edulis is an edible mushroom held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto. The mushroom is low <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and digestible carbohydrates, {{and high in}} protein, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Although it is sold commercially, {{it is very difficult}} to cultivate. Available fresh in autumn in Central, Southern and Northern Europe, it is most often dried, packaged and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. B.edulis is one of the few fungi sold pickled. The fungus also produces a variety of organic compounds with a diverse spectrum of biological activity, including the steroid derivative ergosterol, a sugar binding protein, antiviral compounds, antioxidants, and phytochelatins, which give the organism resistance to toxic heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|The Hanford Site is {{a mostly}} {{decommissioned}} nuclear production complex {{operated by the}} United States federal government on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington. The site has been known by many names, including: Hanford Project, Hanford Works, Hanford Engineer Works and Hanford Nuclear Reservation. Established in 1943 {{as part of the}} Manhattan Project in Hanford, south-central Washington, the site was home to the B Reactor, the first full-scale plutonium production reactor in the world. Plutonium manufactured at the site was used in the first nuclear bomb, tested at the Trinity site, and <b>in</b> <b>Fat</b> Man, the bomb detonated over Nagasaki, Japan.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} the activation of various insulin signaling molecules <b>in</b> human <b>fat</b> <b>in</b> vivo and compared signaling reactions in visceral and subcutaneous fat depots. Paired abdominal omental and subcutaneous fat biopsies {{were obtained from}} nonobese subjects with normal insulin sensitivity under basal conditions and 6 and 30 min following administration of intravenous insulin. Insulin receptor phosphorylation was more intense and rapid and insulin receptor protein content was greater in omental than in subcutaneous adipose tissue (P < 0. 05). Insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt also occurred {{to a greater extent}} and earlier in omental than <b>in</b> subcutaneous <b>fat</b> (P < 0. 05) in the absence of significant changes in Akt protein content. Accordingly, phosphorylation of the Akt substrate glycogen synthase kinase- 3 was more responsive to insulin stimulation <b>in</b> omental <b>fat.</b> Protein content of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) - 1 / 2 was threefold higher in omental than <b>in</b> subcutaneous <b>fat</b> (P < 0. 05), and ERK phosphorylation showed an early 6 -min peak <b>in</b> omental <b>fat,</b> <b>in</b> contrast with a more gradual increase observed <b>in</b> subcutaneous <b>fat.</b> <b>In</b> conclusion, the adipocyte insulin signaling system of omental fat shows greater and earlier responses to insulin than that of subcutaneous fat. These findings may contribute to explain the biological diversity of the two fat depots. © 2006 by the American Diabetes Association...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{diagrammatic}} {{illustration of}} the process of lipolysis (<b>in</b> a <b>fat</b> cell) induced by high epinephrine and low insulin levels in the blood. Epinephrine binds to a beta-adrenergic receptor in the cell wall of the adipocyte, which causes cAMP to be generated inside the cell. The cAMP activates a protein kinase, which phosphorylates and thus, in turn, activates a hormone-sensitive lipase <b>in</b> the <b>fat</b> cell. This lipase cleaves free fatty acids from their attachment to glycerol <b>in</b> the <b>fat</b> stored <b>in</b> the <b>fat</b> droplet of the adipocyte. The free fatty acids and glycerol are then released into the blood.|$|R
5|$|The company {{introduced}} its first broiled chicken sandwich, the BK Broiler, in 1990. The sandwich included a dill-ranch mayonnaise and was {{served on a}}n oat-bran roll. In 1998, BK reformulated the BK Broiler into a larger, more male-oriented sandwich: a larger chicken patty with mayonnaise served on a Whopper bun. In 2002, BK changed {{the name of the}} sandwich to Chicken Whopper and added a smaller Chicken Whopper Jr. sandwich. The company replaced the Chicken Whopper line with another broiled sandwich line in 2003, the BK Baguette line. The chicken sandwich, served on a fresh cooked baguette roll, and came in several varieties, all of which were topped with a series of ingredients that were low <b>in</b> <b>fat.</b> They were sold in the United States at one time, but are now sold only in the European market. The failed Baguette line was replaced in North America with the current grilled chicken iteration, the TenderGrill sandwich.|$|E
5|$|The first dish {{known to}} have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, a number of West African peoples had traditions of {{seasoned}} fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. Prior to the Second World War, fried chicken was often very expensive and was only enjoyed on special occasions. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, however, fried chicken has been mass-produced and the price of the dish has gone down significantly.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in human nutrition. Most are low <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanisms}} controlling fat depot-specific metabolism {{are poorly}} understood. During starvation of mice, downregulation of lipogenic genes, suppression of fatty acid synthesis, {{and increases in}} lipid oxidation were all more pronounced in epididymal than <b>in</b> subcutaneous <b>fat.</b> <b>In</b> epididymal <b>fat,</b> relatively strong upregulation of uncoupling protein 2 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase genes was found. In mice maintained both at 20 and 30 °C, AMP-activated protein kinase was activated in epididymal but did not change <b>in</b> subcutaneous <b>fat.</b> Our results suggest that AMPK may {{have a role in}} the different response of various fat depots to starvation...|$|R

25|$|Another set of {{significant}} physical changes during puberty happen in bodily distribution {{of fat and}} muscle. This process is different for females and males. Before puberty, there are nearly no sex differences <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and muscle distribution; during puberty, boys grow muscle much faster than girls, although both sexes experience rapid muscle development. In contrast, though both sexes experience an increase in body fat, the increase is much more significant for girls. Frequently, the increase <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> for girls happens in their years just before puberty. The ratio between muscle and fat among post-pubertal boys is around three to one, while for girls it is about five to four. This may help explain sex differences in athletic performance.|$|E
