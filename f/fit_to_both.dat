An analytic expression of the rf excitation lineshape is derived, which in general contains a bound-free component and a bound-bound component.

40|$|Hidden Markov {{models are}} often applied in {{quantitative}} finance {{to capture the}} stylised facts of financial returns. They are usually discrete-time models {{and the number of}} states rarely exceeds two because of the quadratic {{increase in the number of}} parameters with the number of states. This paper presents an extension to continuous time where it is possible to increase the number of states with a linear rather than quadratic growth in the number of parameters. The possibility of increasing the number of states leads to a better <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> the distributional and temporal properties of daily returns...|$|E

The {{results show that the}} models in question provide reasonable <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> option prices and returns data in the in-sample estimation period. This contrasts previous findings where stochastic volatility paths are found to be too smooth relative to the option implied dynamics. While the models perform well during the high volatility estimation period, they tend to overprice long dated contracts out-of-sample. This evidence points towards a too simplistic specification of the mean dynamics of volatility...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{determine}} whether EEG spikes are predictable, time series of EEG spike intervals were generated from subdural and depth electrode recordings from four patients.

Linear and nonlinear models were <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> types of data.
