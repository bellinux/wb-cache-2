5000|$|Moth was {{dispatched}} to the Middle East (Mesopotamia area) in 1916. In 1919, she was {{dispatched to}} the White Sea, and by 1920 she had been reassigned to the China Station. Her edited logbooks and maps of her journeys for 1919 and 1920 can be viewed at naval-history.net. In December 1941 she {{became a member of}} the Far East fleet with [...] at Hong Kong. On 8 December 1941, Moth and Cicala were in port during an air raid by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. Cicala was sunk on 21 <b>December.</b> <b>Moth</b> was in the dock for repairs, but with the fall of the city to the Japanese imminent, Moth was scuttled on 12 December. The destroyer [...] was also in port and was captured by the Japanese Army. Thracian was placed on duty as Patrol boat No.101 in October 1942.|$|E

Eggs are {{typically}} laid in spiral clusters on oak twigs. In Louisiana, particularly {{in cities such as}} Baton Rouge or New Orleans, where use of live oaks as street trees is extensive, the caterpillars can become a significant nuisance for humans. The caterpillars of this moth can also be found in some areas of Virginia, such as the Goshen Scout Reservation, where they are infamous for stinging people going to a summer camp in the area.|$|R
40|$|Monitoring of {{chickpea}} pod-borer, Helicoverpa armigera (Hb.) and its acvities throughtout {{the year}} was studied by installing pheromone traps at Pulses Research Center, Ishurdi, Pabna during January 2004 to <b>December</b> 2006. Pod-borer <b>moth</b> catching in pheromone traps was started between 3 rd weeks of January to 2 nd weeks of February depending on the climatic conditions of the year. Catching of moths was increased gradually and reached its pesk {{in the month of}} April then gradually decreased and diminished to zero in the last week of July and ultimately remained zero upto December. Integrated Pest Management Programme against chickpea pod-borer should be initiated from mid-January to manage this pest population very effectively...|$|R
2500|$|After the {{completion}} of Alexander the Great, Burton had high hopes for a favourable reception of the [...] "intelligent epic", {{and went back to}} complete his next assignment for Fox, Jean Negulesco's The Rains of Ranchipur (1955). In this remake of Fox's own 1939 film The Rains Came, Burton played a Hindu doctor, Rama Safti, who falls in love with Lady Edwina Esketh (Lana Turner), an invitee of the Maharani of the fictional town of Ranchipur. Burton faced the same troubles with playing character roles as before with Belch. The Rains of Ranchipur released on 16 <b>December</b> 1955, three <b>moths</b> before Alexander the Great rolled out in 28 March 1956. Contrary to Burton's expectations, both the films were critical and commercial failures, and he rued his decision to act in them. Time magazine critic derided The Rains of Ranchipur and even went as far as to say Richard was hardly noticeable in the film. A. H. Weiler of The New York Times, however, called Burton's rendering of Alexander [...] "serious and impassioned".|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Prince of Players, Burton met {{director}} Robert Rossen, who was well-known at the time for his Academy Award-winning film, All the King's Men (1949). Rossen planned to cast Burton in Alexander the Great (1956) as the eponymous character. Burton accepted Rossen's offer after the director reassured him he had been studying the Macedonian king for two years to make sure the film was historically accurate. Burton was loaned by Fox to the film's production company United Artists, which paid him a fee of $100,000. Alexander the Great was made mostly in Spain during February 1955 and July 1955 on a budget of $6 million. The film reunited Burton with Bloom and it was also the first film he made with her. Bloom played the role of Barsine, the daughter of Artabazos II of Phrygia, and one of Alexander's three wives. Fredric March, Danielle Darrieux, Stanley Baker, Michael Hordern and William Squire were respectively cast as Philip II of Macedon, Olympias, Attalus, Demosthenes and Aeschines.After the completion of Alexander the Great, Burton had high hopes for a favourable reception of the [...] "intelligent epic", and went back to complete his next assignment for Fox, Jean Negulesco's The Rains of Ranchipur (1955).
