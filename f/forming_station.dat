50|$|For {{several years}} now, at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), a {{pressure}} or high pressure (thermo)forming process {{is used to}} fabricate film microchips for capillary electrophoresis (CE) 3-5 and for three-dimensional cell cultivation 6-8. The process {{is derived from the}} macroscopic trapped sheet forming process 2. This is a simple variation of vacuum or pressure forming without prestretching, i.e. a single stage forming, into a female mould with heating of the plastic sheet using a contact heating plate inside the <b>forming</b> <b>station.</b> The forming air is supplied via through holes in the heating plate. Still in a laboratory scale process, diverse thermoplastic films also from biodegradable polymers such as polycaprolactone (PCL) with thicknesses typically between 20 and 100 µm are thermoformed. This is performed with gas pressures up to 5 MPa into mechanically micromachined cavities of plate shaped micromoulds from brass.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of thermoforming, a plastic film or sheet is unwound from the reel and guided though a {{pre-heating}} station on the blister line. The temperature of the pre-heating plates (upper and lower plates) is such that the plastic will soften and become pliable. The warm plastic will then arrive in a <b>forming</b> <b>station</b> where a large pressure (4 to 8 bar) will form the blister cavity into a negative mold. The mold is cooled such that the plastic becomes rigid again and maintains its shape when removed from the mold. In case of difficult shapes, the warm film will be physically pushed down partially into the cavity by a [...] "plug-assist" [...] feature. Plug-assist results in a blister cavity with more uniform wall distribution and is typically used when the cavity size and shape is larger than a small tablets and capsules.|$|E

40|$|Oriented {{structural}} board (OSB) is a wood-based material {{made from}} wood particles {{with a certain}} size and shape: The "natural" stiffness of the strands together with their size and orientation is utilized to produce boards with a low glue content but with a good MOE (modulus of elasticity). Strand geometry, influenced by the flaking process, and strand orientation and homogeneity during mat forming are crucial quantities which determine the board quality. Wilhelm-Klauditz-Institut (WKI) already reported on automatic strand geometry measurement and assessment (see Asian Timber March/April 2005) and detection of density variations in the board using thermography (see Asian Timber Nov(Dec 2005).

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{calibrate}} seismic stations {{to improve the}} monitoring of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is partially limited by the availability of seismic events with known locations and source properties. To confidently extrapolate from these events to aseismic regions, and to properly account for discontinuities in seismic properties requires accurate geophysical models. This paper lays out a preliminary, first-order, regionalization of the Middle East and North African (MENA) region. The model specifies boundaries and velocity structures based on the geology and tectonics of the region, previously published studies, and empirical data observations by the LLNL group. This model is a starting point {{and is expected to}} be improved and refined by comparisons with ongoing tomography efforts and the collection of new data. We anticipate that this model and its successors will prove useful as a background model in the process of <b>forming</b> <b>station</b> calibration maps based on intelligent interpolation techniques such as kriging.

This report {{is designed to be}} used in combination with that earlier paper. The reader is referred to Sweeney and Walter (1998) for all details, including definitions, references, uses, shortcomings, etc., of the regionalization process. In this report we will discuss only those regions in which we have changed the boundaries or velocity structure from that given by the original paper. The paper by Sweeney and Walter (1998) drew on a variety of sources to estimate a preliminary, first-order regionalization of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), providing regional boundaries and velocity models within each region. The model attempts to properly account for major structural discontinuities and significant crustal thickness and velocity variations on a gross scale. The model can be used to extrapolate sparse calibration data within a distinct geophysical region. This model can also serve as a background model in the process of <b>forming</b> <b>station</b> calibration maps using intelligent interpolation techniques such as kriging, extending the calibration into aseismic areas. Such station maps can greatly improve the ability to locate and identify seismic events, which in turn improves the ability to seismically monitor for underground nuclear testing. The original model from Sweeney and Walter (1998) was digitized to a 1 {sup o} resolution, for simplicity we will hereafter refer to this model as MENA 1. 0. The new model described here has also been digitized to a 1 {sup o} resolution and will be referred to as MENA 1. 1 throughout this report...|$|E
40|$|With the {{steadily}} {{increase in}} demand for roll formed products due to their application for fields such as automotive, construction, architecture, etc., roll forming companies are challenge with rising customer demands. Companies are struggling to bring a product through from design to manufacture at improved rates, whilst achieving tighter tolerances. The roll forming process may also induce undesirable forming defects such as twist, distortion and straightness problems. Traditionally these issues would be resolved through an empirical approach which heavily relies on the designer's expertise and intuition. This approach can increase undesired development costs due to materials wasted and time delayed. Over the years, numerical simulations have been deployed to try and geometrically validate these defects and ultimately reduce the development phase of a product. The designer has the capability to virtually investigate changes in specific parameters without the risk of expensive tooling costs. The industry partner of this project, Hadley Group, Birmingham, implement Belleville washers into the roll tool configuration. The purpose of these washers is to apply pressure to the strip during roll forming in order to drive material through each <b>forming</b> <b>station.</b> They are also used to adjust {{the gap between the}} top and bottom forming rolls, since the incoming material gauge can vary by the nominal tolerance values from coil to coil. For the purpose of this paper, an investigation is carried out focusing on an individual parameter within the finite element analysis (FEA) of the cold roll forming process, i. e. the 'unknown' spring acting on the top roll during the forming process due to the implementation of Belleville washers in the pillar set up. The work explained in this paper shows the eects of the pressure applied to the forming process on the geometric attributes of the section being formed. The outcome will determine the viability of this parameter, which may ultimately require the numerical design methodology of roll formed products to be amended accordingly...|$|E
40|$|As its {{production}} increased tenfold {{in the last}} ten years in Europe, OSB represents today more than a simple alternative to plywood. While it could be now considered as a well-established wood-based panel, oriented strand boards do not yet achieve optimal properties. Proof of this are the technological developments being carried out intensively in RTD for every process step, from flaking until pressing. This paper deals in two first parts with possibilities of assessing crucial parameters such as strand size and orientation using innovative off-line and on-line methods. The latter are based on image processing and were developed at the Fraunhofer insitute, Wilhelm-Klauditz-Institute for Wood Research (WKI) for answering both industrial and laboratory needs in matter of optimization of structure. Particular attention was paid to the statistical characterization of a batch of strands: It was shown that main dimensions of a population of strands are mostly lognormally distributed and then may be described using a small set of suitable indices. Numerous batches were analysed and the influence of climatic and processing parameters on post-disintegration was investigated. For industrial applications, an on-line mat quality assessment system ready for use between the <b>forming</b> <b>station</b> and the press was developed. To illustrate possibilities of structure optimization, results of investigations of strengthening of OSB with strands of optimal geometry will be presented. Thanks to additions of small quantities of veneer strips, the so-called "uniform strands", the bending properties of panels were highly increased. Advantages could be taken of that statement by saving on adhesive amounts so as to reach properties required by norms, or by putting on the market a strengthened OSB. The surface evenness that affects the suitability of OSB regarding painting and coating was also assessed using a measuring technique based on fringe-projection and image processing. The quantitative analysis shows how uniform strands close pores on surface and make the product more appropriate to coating...|$|E

40|$|Three-Dimensional Printing (3 DPTM) is a rapid-manufacturing process {{originally}} developed at MIT for building parts directly from CAD-generated models. Parts are fabricated in "slices" {{by creating a}} complete layer of powder and then selectively joining powder particles with a polymer binder deposited using a moving printhead. Traditional 3 DPTM builds layers by spreading dry powder and prints binder using a rastering scheme with a continuous-jet printhead. For smaller parts and greater accuracy, {{a variation on the}} process called slurry 3 DPTM (s 3 DPTM) uses raster-built slurry layers and a vector-printing scheme with a drop on demand (DoD) printhead. This here thesis presents efforts to improve core technology in both dry-powder 3 DPTM and slurry 3 DPTM. One of the most critical steps in s 3 DPTM is the building of the slurry layers. To avoid intra- and interlayer defects the slurry layer must be rastered at high deposition rates to promote line merging and better layer quality. The difficulty lies in the design of a machine capable of oscillating the slurry nozzle at the required frequencies. Fortunately, such a design was completed and the machine built as part of a collaborative effort with TDK Japan to build an s 3 DPTM machine for manufacturing small parts. The design uses a reciprocating countermass strategy to recycle mechanical energy and eliminate troublesome vibrations. A general overview of this slurry layer <b>forming</b> <b>station</b> (LFS) is given, along with an in-depth treatment of several components, including the forcers, centering system, and interface software. And speaking of rastering, dry-powder 3 DPTM relies on this strategy for printing binder, just as the LFS uses a raster method to build powder layers. Beginning with observations made during the design of the LFS, the fluid-handling system was redesigned to improve binder droplet stream stability during the carriage traverse and turnaround. The improvement was made possible by repositioning a smaller version of the "Clamshell" constant pressure vessel used to set the fluid flow rate to the printhead carriage itself and using a closed-loop control system to maintain a constant fluid level in the Clamshell. Drawings, parts lists, schematic diagrams, and assembly instructions are included for building additional fluid control systems. by David C. Ables. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{quality of}} OSB (oriented strand boards) is mainly {{determined}} by three process steps: flaking, mat forming, and pressing. Strand geometry, {{influenced by the}} flaking process, strand orientation and homogeneity during mat forming, and the surface evenness are crucial properties which determine the board quality. Fraunhofer WKI in Braunschweig developed off-line and on-line evaluation methods based on image processing, thermography, and optical 3 D measurement. Strand orientation during the mat forming process can be monitored using image processing: A camera continuously acquires gray-value images of {{a part of the}} mat surface moving from the mat <b>forming</b> <b>station</b> towards the press. After a transformation of the image into the spatial frequency domain (via FFT) and the application of an algorithm suitable for segmentation of the strands in the top layer one can derive indices for the mat quality: The deviation of the orientation angles of the strands from the production direction, an index for the quality of orientation, and an index for the size distribution of the strands. The software using these methods is ready for integration into statistical process control concepts. As a matter of fact the geometry of the strands influences the quality of the OSB, and here in particular the strength properties. Another software for statistic laboratory analyses of the strand geometry was developed allowing the evaluation of size and outline parameters. Thus, for example, the post-disintegration and smoothing of the particle shapes by the drying process could be verified. Thermography transforms the temperature distribution on a surface into gray-value images (thermograms). Thermal images of boards leaving the press reflect the local density distribution of the board. Therefore, thermographic inspection of the boards after leaving the press may be a novel technique for on-line density monitoring. One surface property of OSB is the evenness (or roughness) characterized by the frequency of small gaps (typically some millimeters wide and not deeper than one millimeter) appearing in the surface near crossing strands. For laboratory purposes a measuring technique based on fringe-projection and image processing has been tested to evaluate different surface qualities. As a result, the OSB surface can be visualized as a topographic map together with statistics on amount and size of gaps. Most of the measuring techniques presented here have already been tested in the industry or under comparable conditions. They are ready for implementation to close some gaps in process measurement technology...|$|E
