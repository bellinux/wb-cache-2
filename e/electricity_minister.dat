40|$|The Dutch {{regulatory}} process for setting the first X-Factors in the electricity distribution sector has gone badly wrong. During two-and-a-half years four different X-Factors were {{published by the}} regulator. These X-Factors fluctuated wildly. We demonstrate that Dutch electricity consumers will pay at least € 300 mln. more over three years for the distribution of electricity than might otherwise have been the case. We estimate that benefits for companies in terms of extra revenue from lowered X-Factors amounts to 3 ~ 5 percent of total asset value. We provide {{a history of the}} {{regulatory process}} and analyse the impact of the different X-Factors on the final bills of consumers.

The Comptroller and Auditor General of India report had stated that the deal Vijayan had struck as <b>electricity</b> <b>minister</b> in 1998 with Lavalin, a Canadian firm, for the repair of three generators, had cost the state exchequer a staggering Rs 375 crores.

There are also reports that the CAG did not report any losses to state exchequer, but that the project did not yield commensurate gains. On 21 January 2009, CBI filed a progress report on the investigation in the Kerala high court. Pinarayi Vijayan had been named as the 9th accused in the case. CPI(M) backed Pinarayi saying that the CBI move was [...] "politically motivated". Party viewed the implication of Pinarayi in the case is to settle scores with the CPM after the party withdrew its support to the UPA government. The CPM led Kerala Government decided not to let Vijayan to be prosecuted in the case. Over-ruling the cabinet recommendation, the Governor allowed CBI to prosecute Vijayan based on prima facie evidence. Though CPI(M) called Governor's move un-constitutional, then Kerala Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan said there is nothing surprising or wrong in Governor's decision. On 5 November 2013, the CBI special court discharged Pinarayi Vijayan and the others accused {{from the list of}} accused in the SNC-Lavalin Case. The court has allowed a plea made by Pinarayi Vijayan asking his name to be removed from the list of accused in the case.
