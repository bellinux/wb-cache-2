The study found that sensory nerve conduction velocity (SCV) could objectively provide a good indicator for assessment of the human response to changes in indoor operative temperatures in a naturally ventilated situation. The results showed that with the changes in the indoor operative temperatures, the changing trend in the nerve conduction velocity was basically the same as that of the skin temperature at the sensory nerve measuring segment (Tskin(scv)). There was good coherent consistency among the factors: <b>indoor</b> <b>operative</b> <b>temperature,</b> SCV and Tskin(scv) in a certain <b>indoor</b> <b>operative</b> <b>temperature</b> range.

The combined research methods of this study involved firstly the field measurement and monitoring work on the existing office space at the Development and Property Management Office, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM). It was to acquire the actual indoor data and provide data for verification of Ecotect simulation program. Secondly, the modelling and simulating of the existing office building in Ecotect so as to evaluate the <b>indoor</b> <b>operative</b> <b>temperature</b> and indoor comfort condition of the office space. The final stage was conducting the parametric study to investigate indoor thermal condition in response to the passive cooling strategies (i. e. changing wall material and night cooling). The study showed that the verification of simulated and measured results indicates a good agreement with discrepancy value less than 10 % and can be considered acceptable as suggested by many researchers. It was also found that by changing to high thermal mass wall material could improve building’s thermal performance index and reduced peak <b>indoor</b> <b>operative</b> <b>temperature</b> about 1 °C. Indoor comfort condition in the office space during the office hours was improved about 22 % (on the ground floor) and 30 % (on the first floor). The results also demonstrated that night cooling compensate the drawback of high thermal mass material and reduced the <b>indoor</b> <b>operative</b> <b>temperature</b> in the early hour of office hours. High thermal mass wall material offers a high potential alternative wall material construction in providing better indoor environmental condition during the day particularly in office building...|$|E

40|$|It is {{possible}} to evaluate the energy demand {{as well as the}} parameters related to indoor thermal comfort through building energy simulation tools. Since energy demand for heating and cooling is directly affected by the required level of thermal comfort, the investigation of the mutual relationship between thermal comfort and energy demand (and therefore operating costs) is of the foremost importance both to define the benchmarks for energy service contracts and to calibrate the energy labelling according to European Directive 2002 / 92 /CE. The connection between indoor thermal comfort conditions and energy demand for both heating and cooling has been analyzed in this work with reference to a set of validation tests (office buildings) derived from a European draft standard. Once a range of required acceptable <b>indoor</b> <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures</b> had been fixed in accordance with Fanger's theory (e. g. 0. 5 < PMV < 0. 5), the effective hourly comfort conditions and the energy consumptions were estimated through dynamic simulations.

40|$|In {{building}} energy simulation, indoor {{thermal comfort}} condition, energy use and equipment size are typically calculated {{based on the}} assumption that the clothing insulation is equal to a constant value of 0. 5 clo during the cooling season and 1. 0 clo during heating season. The assumption is not reflected in practice and thus it may lead to errors. In reality, occupants frequently adjust their clothing depending on the thermal conditions, as opposed to the assumption of constant clothing values above, indicating that the clothing insulation variation should be captured in building simulation software to obtain more reliable and accurate results. In this study, the impact of three newly developed dynamic clothing insulation models on the building simulation is quantitatively assessed using the detailed whole-building energy simulation program, EnergyPlus version 6. 0. The results showed that when the HVAC is controlled based on indoor temperature the dynamic clothing models do not affect <b>indoor</b> <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures,</b> energy consumption and equipment sizing. When the HVAC is controlled based on the PMV model the use of a fixed clothing insulation during the cooling (0. 5 clo) and heating (1. 0 clo) season leads to the incorrect estimation of the <b>indoor</b> <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures,</b> energy consumption and equipment sizing. The dynamic clothing models significantly (p< 0. 0001) improve the ability of energy simulation tools to assess thermal comfort.

40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{determine}} potential vernacular passive cooling strategies for improving thermal comfort of modern urban houses in hot-humid climate of Malaysia. Field measurements were carried out in two traditional timber Malay houses and two traditional masonry Chinese shophouses to investigate their indoor thermal environments and passive cooling techniques. The results of the former showed that the indoor air temperatures were higher than the outdoor air temperatures by 1 °C during daytime under open window conditions and 2 °C at night under closed window conditions on average. The results of the latter revealed that indoor air temperatures adjacent to small courtyards were lower than immediate outdoors by up to 5 - 6 °C during daytime; at night, the indoor air temperatures maintained values similar to the outdoors. The small courtyards were effective to enhance night ventilation and nocturnal radiant cooling in the high mass shophouses.

While the entire state of Jordan faces serious shortages in energy sources, significant growth in both industrial investment and constructions is noticed {{in the last few years}} particularly in Amman. This includes construction of both apartment and office buildings using a relatively new construction systems/elements. In Amman, for instance, Double-skin facades (DSF) have recently been introduced to a few buildings. However, there are no noticeable studies showing how it will work under the climate of Amman. Literature from similar climates indicates that while DSF is expected to perform well in winter, summer overheating is a major problem in hot regions due to large glazed surfaces facing excessive direct solar gains that coincide with high ambient temperatures. Thus, it is highly important to investigate the operational performance of this relatively new system in such a climate before it is widely applied due to its advantages as a promising passive technology. This study aims to investigate the thermal performance of DSF integrated into office buildings in Amman. Intended work was conducted using TAS tool and based on Amman’s weather file. Results showed that integration of DSF into multi-storeys office buildings would generally increase <b>indoor</b> <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures</b> for both conditions. While this would lead to significant overheating in summer times, indoor thermal comfort would almost be achieved in winter with a slight possibility of overheating during peak hours.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate vernacular passive cooling techniques and their potential application for improving indoor thermal comfort of naturally ventilated, modern brick terraced houses in Malaysia. Field measurement was conducted in two traditional timber Malay houses and two traditional masonry Chinese shophouses to examine their indoor thermal environments. The results of the former showed that the indoor air temperatures were higher than the outdoor air temperatures by 1 °C during daytime under open window conditions and 2 °C at night under closed window conditions on average. The emphasis was on reducing the temperature of the outdoor air before entering the lightweight house for bodily cooling by cross ventilation. The outdoor air temperature at the Malay house sites was lower than that of the terraced house site by 1. 7 °C on average. The results of the latter revealed that indoor air temperatures in rooms that were adjacent to small internal courtyards were lower than the immediate outdoors by about 5 °C on average at the peak period.

40|$|School {{buildings}} {{are among the}} most important building types that integrate significant aspects of sustainability research: building performance, energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality and the benefits of a healthy and productive environment. Providing thermal comfort in classrooms is an obvious necessity because students spend up to one-third of the day in school. Elevated air temperature is a common problem in most school classrooms during periods of increased thermal load; however, it could lead to a reduction in children’s schoolwork performance. In addition, school {{buildings are}} major energy consumers due to significant demands for heating and cooling to provide acceptable thermal comfort conditions. Thermal comfort studies and widely used standards have largely concentrated on research with adults. It is argued here that a re-examination of current approaches to thermal comfort for children could inform improved design of school buildings and thereby optimize conditions for students’ performance. To examine the thermal perceptions of children in naturally ventilated classrooms, three sets of field experiments were conducted in primary schools in Shiraz, Iran. The field work procedures consisted of thermal comfort surveys designed for the target age group and concurrent measurements of indoor and outdoor environmental variables. The analysis of the results addresses children’s thermal perception, gender differences, the relationship between children’s indoor comfort temperature and outdoor climate, and adaptive behaviour in classrooms. It is shown that the PMV-PPD model underestimates children’s actual thermal sensation and the percentage dissatisfied in the investigated classrooms. Moreover, the sampled children feel comfortable at lower temperatures than predicted by the ASHRAE Adaptive model during the warm season. The analysis suggests that children may be slightly less sensitive to indoor temperature change but less tolerant to high temperatures than adults. Overall, it appears that children have a warmer thermal sensation than would be expected based on adult-based models and that they require cooler <b>indoor</b> <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures</b> to achieve thermal comfort in the classroom. The results imply that the thermal comfort models given in the standards do not accurately address children’s thermal sensation in the classroom, and they highlight a lack of comprehensive understanding of children’s thermal perception, including metabolism and other physiological factors...|$|R

Literature review [...] 3. Methods [...] 4. Results and discussion [...] 5. Conclusions [...] Appendices. Given contemporaneous concerns of climate change and increasing fossil fuel prices, architects and building designers are exploring mixed-mode (MM) ventilation {{as a way of}} combining the best features of air-conditioned (AC) and naturally-ventilated (NV) buildings. MM or ‘hybrid’ buildings utilise a ‘free-running’ NV mode whenever outdoor weather conditions are considered favourable, but revert to mechanical systems for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning when external conditions are deemed less favourable for occupants. This thesis explores how occupant expectations and environmental attitudes may influence thermal comfort and occupant satisfaction {{within the context of the}} indoor thermal environment. In doing so, it evaluates the potential for climate change mitigation in NV and MM buildings through occupant behavioural adaptations. Two academic office buildings with different ventilation strategies (i. e. MM and NV) from a university in Sydney, Australia were used as case studies for this research. Post-occupancy evaluations (POEs) supplemented with the 15 -item New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) questionnaire, measuring strength of endorsement (from low to high) of an ecological worldview, were conducted in both buildings to examine how environmental attitudes caninfluence occupants’ tolerance of the indoor environmental performance of green buildings. Parallel thermal comfort studies, along with continuous indoor and outdoor climate measurements, were also conducted to investigate the differences in occupant satisfaction and comfort perceptions between each building and between the POE and comfort questionnaires. The POE ‘forgiveness factor’ attempts to quantify the users’ tolerance of a building’s environmental conditions by taking into account the user’s scores for thermal, acoustic and visual comfort. This study found a possible association between environmental beliefs and occupants’ forgiveness factor, which suggests that despite having less-than-ideal thermal conditions, occupants with higher NEP scores were more tolerant of their building’s shortcomings compared to occupants with lower NEP scores. Analyses of subjects’ thermal sensation within the MM building indicated that observed comfort votes (Actual Mean Vote – AMV) measured in AC mode were congruent to those predicted using the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) equation. During NV mode, however, observed AMV values did not conform to the PMV values, suggesting that occupants were more adaptive to <b>indoor</b> <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures</b> during NV mode as opposed to when the building was in AC mode. In comparison, whilst occupants experienced significantly warmer <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures</b> in the NV building, observed thermal sensations were also found to differ from the predicted values, suggesting adaptive behaviours of the occupants. Thermal satisfaction and acceptability, along with participant comments and anecdotal evidence from each building, were analysed to investigate the effectiveness of POE methods in evaluating building performance. Results from this study suggest occupants can and do use POE as a vehicle for complaint about general workplace issues, unrelated to their building. This thesis underscores the importance of occupant expectations and attitudes within the indoor thermal environment. Each study highlights significant differences between occupants’ thermal responses under different indoor environmental conditions, suggesting people’s environmental attitudes and expectations affect their perception of comfort and satisfaction within MM and NV buildings. Furthermore, the complexity of thermal perception and the inadequacy of static models to describe occupant comfort in MM buildings are discussed in the context of whether such design approaches fall within the scope of international adaptive comfort standards. This research provides evidence to support extending the psychological dimensions of thermal comfort and building performance studies to account for the contextual influences at play in green buildings, such as environmental attitudes, expectations and personal control.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{environmental}} and individual factors on thermal sensation in airconditioned office environments were analysed for two large, fully compatible thermal comfort field studies in contrasting Australian climates. In the hot – humid location of Townsville, 836 office workers were surveyed; 935 workers participated in hot – arid Kalgoorlie-Boulder. Overall perceived work area temperature and measured <b>indoor</b> <b>operative</b> <b>temperature</b> correlated moderately with thermal sensation for Townsville (T) subjects but only perceived temperature correlated with Kalgoorlie-Boulder (KB) sensation. Multiple regression analyses confirmed that indoor climatic variables (including Predicted Mean Vote) contributed to actual thermal sensation vote (24 % T; 15 % KB), with operative temperature having more of an effect in T than in KB. Subsequent analyses of individual characteristics showed no linear contributions to thermal sensation. The remaining variances {{were significantly related to}} perceived work area temperature (7 % additional explained variance in T; 12 % in KB). Mann – Whitney analyses (after correction for climatic variables) showed that T subjects with higher job satisfaction had thermal sensations closer to ‘neutral’. Males, healthier subjects, non-smokers, respondents with earlier survey times and underweight occupants had lower median thermal sensations in KB. Townsville occupants appeared more adapted to their outdoor climatic conditions than Kalgoorlie-Boulder respondents, perhaps due to limited home air-conditioning. Further research into non-thermal impacts on gender-related thermal acceptability is suggested. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Though {{uncertainties}} of input variables may have significant implications on building simulations, {{they are quite}} often not identified, quantified, or included in building simulations results. This paper considers climatic deterministic, uncertainty, and sensitivity analysis {{through a series of}} simulations using the CIBSE UKCIP 02 future weather years, CIBSE TM 48 for design summer years (DSYs), and the latest CIBSE TM 49 DSY future weather data which incorporates the UKCP 09 projections to evaluate the variance and the impact of differing London future weather files on <b>indoor</b> <b>operative</b> <b>temperature</b> of a detached dwelling in the United Kingdom using the CIBSE TM 52 overheating criteria. The work analyses the variability of comparable weather data set to identify the most influential weather parameters that contribute to thermal comfort implications for these dwellings. The choice of these weather files is to ascertain their differences, as their development is underpinned by different climatic projections. The overall pattern of the variability of the UKCIP 02 and UKCP 09 Heathrow weather data sets under Monte Carlo sensitivity consideration {{do not seem to be}} very different from each other. The deterministic results show that the operative temperatures of the UKCIP 02 are slightly higher than those of UKCP 09, with the UKCP 09 having a narrow range of operative temperatures. The Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis quantified and affirmed the dry bulb and radiant temperatures as the most influential weather parameters that affect thermal comfort on dwellings...|$|E
40|$|The European {{standard}} EN 15251 specifies {{design criteria}} for dimensioning of building systems. In detail, it proposes that the adaptive comfort model is used, at first, for dimensioning passive means; but, if <b>indoor</b> <b>operative</b> <b>temperature</b> {{does not meet}} the chosen long-term adaptive comfort criterion in the “cooling season”, the design would include a mechanical cooling system. In this case, the reference design criteria are provided accordingly the Fanger comfort model. However, there is a discontinuity by switching from the adaptive to the Fanger model, since the best building variant, according to the former, may not coincide with the optimal according to the latter. In this paper, an optimization procedure to support the design of a comfort-optimized net zero energy building is proposed. It uses an optimization engine (GenOpt) for driving a dynamic simulation engine (EnergyPlus) towards those building variants that minimize, at first, two seasonal long-term discomfort indices based on an adaptive model; and if indoor conditions do not meet the adaptive comfort limits or analyst’s expectations, it minimizes two seasonal long-term discomfort indices based on the Fanger model. The calculation of such indices has been introduced in EnergyPlus via the Energy Management System module, by writing computer codes in the EnergyPlus Reference Language. The used long-term discomfort indices proved to provide similar ranking capabilities of building variants, even if they are based on different comfort models, and the proposed procedure meets the two- step procedure suggested by EN 15251 without generating significant discontinuities...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of natural ventilation and cooling due to stack effects was investigated for large spaces with high ceilings. Different opening area ratios {{with respect to}} floor area were studied. Parameters of stack effects that consider floor heights were analyzed. Performance of natural ventilation was evaluated with cooling effects and indoor air quality for different months of the year. Three cities in northern, middle and southern Taiwan were used to represent typical subtropical weather types. It was found that opening ratio above 0. 9 ％ is sufficient to provide fresh air to meet IAQ requirement. Two different temperature control strategies, fixed <b>indoor</b> <b>temperature</b> (FIT) and <b>operative</b> <b>indoor</b> <b>temperature</b> (OIT) were proposed and studied. A sensible cooling potential, fpc, was proposed. Different levels of fpc, namely, strong, medium, weak and not available were {{used to evaluate the}} number of days for which natural cooling, hybrid ventilation, mechanical air conditioning are to be applied to satisfy the cooling requirement. The research results presented can be used in the design of openings for large spaces, and also the airconditioning control strategies for different seasons of the year...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} internal {{building envelope}} retrofitting of multi-storey, multi-owner residential buildings. The main {{question is how}} does the additional insulation placed {{on the inner side}} of the building envelope affect its thermal inertia. Among other reasons, thermal inertia is important in increasing human comfort in the space, avoiding overheating in summer, and managing solar gains. Inside insulation can alter this behaviour, and the aim is to understand the positive and negative consequences of such an intervention. The work assesses insulating materials and components integrated in the internal side of the retrofitted buildings in the summer periods. The scope of work addresses warm temperate climate with dry and warm summers, abbreviated as ‘Csb’ according to Koppen climate classification, and which is represented in the city of Milan, Italy. The alternatives assessed consider lightweight as well as massive building envelopes. To that aim, simulations are carried out {{in order to understand the}} variance in the thermal behaviour of the envelope, corresponding to the change in insulation placement on the building envelope (inside, outside or without). Analytical assessment is performed in order to include air and surface temperatures and internal heat loads. The results show that, under the conditions of this study, both internal and external insulation are beneficial in terms of surface, <b>indoor</b> air and <b>operative</b> <b>temperatures</b> in summertime. With insulation placed outside, the higher thermal capacity increases instead the comfort conditions, measured in discomfort degree hours (DDH) ...|$|R
