The proximate composition, chemical and sensory properties as affected by the processing method and variety were evaluated. The proximate composition of the ‘abacha’ (on dry basis) showed moisture content range of 9. 53 – 10. 48 %, protein 1. 07 – 1. 66 %, ash 2. 06 – 2. 56 %, fibre 1. 72 – 1. 95, fat 0. 39 – 0. 58 % and carbohydrate content of 83. 59 – 85. 05 %. The chemical composition of the wet ‘abacha’ slices showed pH of 5. 60 – 5. 80, total titratable acidity (TTA) of 0. 047 – 0. 063, and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) value of 7. 80 – 10. 41 mg/ 100 g. Generally, the TTA of the ‘abacha’ samples was not significantly (p> 0. 05) affected by the method of processing ‘abacha’ and the variety used. Drying the wet ‘abacha’ reduced the pH to 5. 20 – 5. 30, increased the TTA to 0. 213 – 0. 230 % and further reduced the HCN content to 7. 32 – 8. 63 mg/ 100 g. The HCN of all the ‘abacha’ samples processed from <b>dried</b> <b>chips</b> were significantly (p< 0. 05) lower than the HCN of ‘abacha’ processed from fresh cassava root {{in some of the}} varieties. The lower sensory scores for ‘abacha’ made from <b>dried</b> <b>chips</b> shows that they were inferior to the ones from fresh cassava, although they were also accepted by the consumers.

The aim of this project was therefore to determine the productivity of two harvesting and processing systems for wood-chips as a joint-product of round wood in Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) forests affected by bark beetles. Two systems with different sorting criteria were studied: processing of sawlogs, pulpwood and wood-chips (System A) in comparison to the process¬ing of only sawlogs and wood-chips (System B). In System A, the energy wood was chipped with a chipper mounted on a forwarder that was working directly in the stand. In System B, the material to be chipped was previously concentrated along the forest road with a forwarder, and a chipper mounted on a truck was used for chipping.

The effect of superheated steam temperature (115, 130, and 145 ? C) and convective heat transfer coefficient (100 and 160 W/m? ?C) on the drying rate of potato chips and on the product quality properties such as shrinkage, density, porosity, microstructure, color, texture, and nutrition loss was investigated. Furthermore, superheated steam impingement dried potato chips (130 and 145 ? C, h = 100 W/m? ?C) were compared to air dried (same conditions), commercial, and fried potato chips. During superheated steam impingement drying, temperature and convective heat transfer coefficient had a significant effect on the drying rate. Potato chips dried at higher drying temperature and convective heat transfer coefficient showed lower shrinkage, lower bulk density, higher porosity, larger pores, and darker color when compared to chips dried at lower temperatures and convective heat transfer coefficient. They presented lower values of hardness and lower vitamin C content. A higher rate of evaporation during the falling rate period was obtained when superheated steam was used as compared to air impingement drying.

Drying exerted a pronounced influence on the strength properties of UF-bonded boards of pine flakes.

The present study sourced for PPD tolerance from different genetic resources available within a cassava germplasm. Six hundred and twelve cassava accessions within International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) -Ibadan germplasm were evaluated 2, 4, 6, and 8 days after harvest (DAH) for PPD and rate of PPD per day (PPD d– 1) over the evaluation dates. Sixteen cassava genotypes that had mean PPD d– 1 of 0. 0 % d– 1 were classified as non-deteriorators (NoDs) with possible delayed-PPD trait and nine genotypes with mean PPD d– 1 ≥ 70 % d– 1 as extra-super fast deteriorators (xSPDs) with possible early-PPD trait. The PPD was more pronounced at the proximal end of a root than at the middle and distal regions. Polyploid genotypes showed higher PPD tolerance than diploids but local varieties were more susceptible to PPD than the improved varieties. The study suggests that polyploidy could be an additional genetic resource for PPD tolerance in cassava. In addition, the knowledge of PPD status of a cassava germplasm allows its proper utilization.
