50|$|Polypodium appalachianum is a fern species {{native to}} eastern North America. Sometimes called the Appalachian polypody or Appalachian rockcap fern, {{it is very}} similar in {{appearance}} to Polypodium virginianum. For years, P. virginianum -- long considered a variety of the British Polypodium vulgare -- was recognized as having cryptic races, with diploid, triploid, and tetraploid representatives. Since the triploid specimens bore abortive spores, it was apparently the hybrid between the diploid and tetraploid groups. In 1991, it was resolved {{that the type of}} P. virginianum was the tetraploid series, and that it is an allotetraploid species of hybrid origin, with the diploid species as one parent. The diploid species was then named P. appalachianum. The other parent of P. virginianum was found to be Polypodium sibiricum. The tetraploid of <b>hybrid</b> <b>derivation</b> tolerates warmer climates than either parent.|$|E

In this paper, we introduce several <b>hybrid</b> <b>derivation</b> modes of CD grammar systems and characterize via this internal hybridization (i. e., all grammars of a CD grammar system {{work in the same}} mode) several external hybridizations (i. e., grammars of one CD grammar system may work in different modes) investigated by Mitrana and Paun. When studying internal versus external hybridizations involving the so-called t-mode of derivation, we obtain cases when internally hybrid systems are strictly more respectively less powerful than their externally hybrid counterparts.

40|$|We {{introduce}} several internally <b>hybrid</b> <b>derivation</b> {{modes of}} cooperating distributed (CD) grammar systems. External hybridizations were investigated by Mitrana and Paun: For example, some {{components of a}} CD grammar system, when enabled, have to work {{as long as possible}} { they work in the so-called t-mode {, and some others, when enabled, perform at least k derivation steps { this is the so-called k-mode. On the other hand, in an internally hybrid grammar system combining the t- and k-mode { we denote this combination by (t^ k) { each component, when enabled, has to work as long as possible, yet performing at least k derivation steps. In this paper, among other things, we show that such externally hybrid CD grammar systems with components working in the t-mode and the k-mode, can be characterized by CD grammar systems with all components working in the (t^ k) - mode, and these can be characterized by recurrent programmed grammars with appearance checking, or, as well, by ET 0 L s [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} logical derivation algorithms {{that can}} be applied to inversion of polynomially computable discrete functions. The proposed approach is {{based on the fact that}} it is possible to or-ganize DPLL derivation on a small subset of variables appeared in a CNF which encodes the algorithm computing the function. The exper-imental results showed that arrays of conflict clauses generated by this mode of derivation, as a rule, have efficient ROBDD representations. This fact is the departing point of development of a <b>hybrid</b> DPLL+ROBDD <b>derivation</b> strategy: derivation techniques for ROBDD representations of conflict databases are the same as those ones in common DPLL (vari-able assignments and unit propagation). In addition, compact ROBDD representations of the conflict databases can be shared effectively in a distributed computing environment. ...|$|R
40|$|A general {{formulation}} of the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation for stochastic hybrid systems is presented, {{within the framework of}} Generalized Stochastic Hybrid Systems (GSHS). The FPK equation describes the time evolution of the probability law of the <b>hybrid</b> state. Our <b>derivation</b> is based on the concept of mean jump intensity, which is related to both the usual stochastic intensity (in the case of spontaneous jumps) and the notion of probability current (in the case of forced jumps).

40|$|AbstractWe {{continue}} our research on <b>hybrid</b> <b>derivation</b> modes of cooperating distributed (CD) grammar systems started in (Fernau et al., Proc. 3 rd Internat. Conf. Developments in Language Theory, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 1997, pp. 261 – 272; Theoret. Comput. Sci. 259 (2001) 405). Here, {{we focus on}} (hybrid) systems with context-free components working in a hybrid t- and Δk-mode, Δ∈{⩽,=}. We prove that CD grammar systems working in the mode (t∧= 1), which means that each component cannot perform more than one derivation step in a row, characterize the context-free programmed languages with finite index. Moreover, we show that additional external hybridization of this mode with, e. g., the = 1 -mode (or = 2 -mode, respectively) leads to a characterization of the context-free ordered languages (or the context-free programmed languages with appearance checking, respectively). In particular, hybrid CD grammar systems with classical and internally hybrid modes have universal computational power, a result which is unknown for hybrid CD grammar systems whose components work only in classical modes, since such systems are computationally equivalent to recurrent programmed grammars with appearance checking, as shown in (Theoret. Computer. Sci. 259 (2001) 405). Furthermore, we obtain a characterization of ordered languages {{within the framework of}} CD grammar systems...|$|E

40|$|Hybrid functionals {{serve as}} a {{powerful}} practical tool in different fields of computational physics and quantum chemistry. On the other hand, their applicability for the case of correlated d and f orbitals is still questionable and needs more considerations. In this article we formulate the on-site occupation dependent exchange correlation energy and effective potential of hybrid functionals for localized states and connect them to the on-site correction term of the DFT+ U method. The resultant formula indicates that the screening of the onsite electron repulsion is governed by {{the ratio of the}} exact exchange in <b>hybrid</b> functionals. Our <b>derivation</b> provides a theoretical justification for adding a DFT+ U-like on-site potential in hybrid-DFT calculations to resolve issues caused by overscreening of localized states. The resulting scheme, hybrid DFT+ V-w, is tested for chromium impurity in wurtzite AlN and vanadium impurity in 4 H-SiC, which are paradigm examples of systems with different degrees of localization between host and impurity orbitals.
