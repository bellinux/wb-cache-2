Each psychiatrist <b>gives</b> <b>one</b> of possibly five diagnoses to each patient. These are compiled into a matrix, and Fleiss' kappa can be computed from this matrix (see example below) to show the degree of agreement between the psychiatrists above the level of agreement expected by chance.|$|E

The animals purr a relaxing trill that the crew find soothing. Klingons, however, find tribbles annoying, and the feeling is mutual: tribbles hiss and shriek whenever they are near Klingons.|$|E

Shreyas Talpade proves that (his previous film), Iqbal was no accident and Gul Panag <b>gives</b> <b>one</b> of the most convincing portrayals of her career. But, it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows your breath away. Her journey from joyous subjugation — where she is content to dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in-laws — to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecology of}} global carbon budgets <b>gives</b> <b>one</b> {{example of the}} linkage between {{biodiversity}} and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth's oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year. There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth's history, regulated {{to a large extent}} by the ecology of the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic outgassing, the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500ppm.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Mahavidya Bagalamukhi, Matangi is {{the other}} Mahavidya, whose worship is {{primarily}} prescribed to acquire supernatural powers. A hymn in the Maha-bhagavata Purana asks her grace to control one's foes, while the Tantrasara says that recitation of her mantra, meditation on her form and her ritual worship <b>gives</b> <b>one</b> to the power to control people and make them attracted to oneself. Her devotees, especially Tantric sadhakas, are regarded to have transcend the pollution by offering her left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) and thus overcome their ego. Worship of Matangi is described to allow her devotee to face the forbidden and transcend pollution, leading him to salvation or allowing him to gain supernatural powers for worldly goals. The Purashcharyarnava describes pleasing the goddess would result in her answering all the devotee's queries by whispering in her ear.|$|E

He buys a replacement, but the original is found shortly afterwards. He <b>gives</b> <b>one</b> to Joey, repairing their friendship. Ross (David Schwimmer) continues to seek forgiveness from Rachel after insulting her in a previous episode, but she tells him that they as a couple will never happen. Monica's parents bring boxes of her possessions to her apartment, and she finds a video of her and Rachel getting ready for their senior prom.|$|E
5|$|Noether's paper, Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains, 1921), is the {{foundation}} of general commutative ring theory, and <b>gives</b> <b>one</b> of the first general definitions of a commutative ring. Before her paper, most results in commutative algebra were restricted to special examples of commutative rings, such as polynomial rings over fields or rings of algebraic integers. Noether proved that in a ring which satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals, every ideal is finitely generated. In 1943, French mathematician Claude Chevalley coined the term, Noetherian ring, to describe this property. A major result in Noether's 1921 paper is the Lasker–Noether theorem, which extends Lasker's theorem on the primary decomposition of ideals of polynomial rings to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem {{can be viewed as a}} generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that any positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers, and that this decomposition is unique.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} PvP modes in Vainglory: Standard, {{in which the}} whole map is available, Battle Royale, in which {{progression}} is faster and the battle is limited only to the lane, and Blitz, in which players must gain the most number of points or reach the 15 point score cap in 5 minutes by taking down turrets and killing off Crystal Sentries or the Gold Miner which gives three points each, or by killing other players which <b>gives</b> <b>one</b> point. If a Blitz match were to ever be tied by the 5 minute mark, then {{the first team to}} score the first point in overtime wins. Players can play ranked Standard games to increase their in-game ranking, or casual Standard games, in which their rank is not affected. In the game client, ranked play duration is listed as 25 minutes, whereas casual play is 20 minutes.|$|E

Breach of fiduciary duty may occur in insider trading, when an insider or a related party makes trades in a corporation's securities based on material non-public information obtained during the performance of the insider's duties at the corporation. Breach of fiduciary duty by a lawyer with regard to a client, if negligent, may be a form of legal malpractice; if intentional, it may be remedied in equity.|$|E

25|$|Khobragade {{was subject}} to {{prosecution}} {{at the time of}} her arrest because she had only consular immunity (which <b>gives</b> <b>one</b> immunity from prosecution only for acts committed in connection with official duties) and not the more extensive diplomatic immunity. After her arrest, the Indian government moved Khobragade to the Indian's mission to the United Nations, upgrading her status and conferring diplomatic immunity on her; as a result, the federal indictment against Khobragade was dismissed in March 2014, although the door was left open to refiling of charges. A new indictment was filed against Khobragade, but by that point she had left the country. (In an effort to resolve the dispute, the U.S. State Department had told Khobragade to leave the country).|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} is usually a digital rectal examination, to examine {{the tone of the}} {{sphincter}} and to determine if preparation has been adequate. The endoscope is then passed through the anus up the rectum, the colon (sigmoid, descending, transverse and ascending colon, the cecum), and ultimately the terminal ileum. The endoscope has a movable tip and multiple channels for instrumentation, air, suction and light. The bowel is occasionally insufflated with air to maximize visibility (a procedure which <b>gives</b> <b>one</b> the false sensation of needing to take a bowel movement). Biopsies are frequently taken for histology. Additionally in a procedure known as chromoendoscopy, a contrast-dye (such as Indigo carmine) may be sprayed via the endoscope onto the bowel wall to help visualise any abnormalities in the mucosal morphology. A Cochrane review updated in 2016 found strong evidence that chromoscopy enhances the detection of cancerous tumours in the colon and rectum.|$|E
25|$|In {{a review}} of the book, Irwin M. Berg, a lawyer and friend of the Kaifeng Jewish community, claims Weisz never figured the many {{religious}} documents—Torah, Haggadah, prayer books, etc.—into his thesis and only relied on the stelae themselves. Such documents can be roughly dated from their physical and scribal characteristics. Even though he refers to Persian words utilized in the stelae, Weisz did not include a study on when the Judeo-Persian language of the liturgical documents first came into use in his thesis. Judeo-Persian first developed in Central Asia during the 8th century, well after the author supposes the Jews first entered China. Berg questions the historical reliability of the three stone inscriptions themselves. He <b>gives</b> <b>one</b> anachronistic example where the Jews claim it was an emperor of the Ming Dynasty who bequeathed the land used to build their first synagogue in 1163 during the Song Dynasty.|$|E
