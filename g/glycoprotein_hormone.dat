500|$|During May's Giro d'Italia, Sylvain Georges tested {{positive}} for the vasodilator heptaminol, after the seventh stage; his positive test was the second by a rider from the [...] squad {{in the space of a}} year, after Steve Houanard {{tested positive}} for the <b>glycoprotein</b> <b>hormone</b> erythropoietin (EPO) in an out-of-competition test in September 2012. Since the team was a member of the Mouvement pour un cyclisme crédible union, a second positive test meant that, according to the union's regulations, they had to stop racing for eight days. The team voluntarily withdrew from the Dauphiné, avoiding a financial penalty which could have been incurred by the team for failing to compete in a World Tour event, against UCI regulations. As a result, the peloton was reduced to the following twenty-two teams.|$|E

After receiving notification of his rider's positive test, team manager Angelo Citracca stated that Di Luca had been sacked– after less than a month with the squad– and that they were launching legal proceedings against Di Luca. Di Luca– who had previously served a fifteen-month suspension after testing positive for continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) at the 2009 Giro d'Italia– himself expressed his [...] "surprise" [...] at the positive test, while race director Michele Acquarone angrily chastised Di Luca at a press conference, describing him as [...] "stupid".|$|E
