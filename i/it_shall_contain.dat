60|$|SOCIALISM {{has been}} {{advocated}} {{by most of}} its champions chiefly {{as a means of}} increasing the welfare of the wage earning classes, and more particularly their material welfare. It has seemed accordingly, to some men whose aims are not material, as if it has nothing to offer toward the general advancement of civilization in the way of art and thought. Some of its advocates, moreover--and among these Marx must be included--have written, no doubt not deliberately, as if with the Socialist revolution the millennium would have arrived, {{and there would be no}} need of further progress for the human race. I do not know whether our age is more restless than that which preceded it, or whether it has merely become more impregnated with the idea of evolution, but, for whatever reason, we have grown incapable of believing in a state of static perfection, and we demand, of any social system, which is to have our approval, that <b>it</b> <b>shall</b> <b>contain</b> within itself a stimulus and opportunity for progress toward something still better. The doubts thus raised by Socialist writers make it necessary to inquire whether Socialism would in fact be hostile to art and science, and whether it would be likely to produce a stereotyped society in which progress would become difficult and slow.|$|E
6000|$|... {{from which}} sober sense is not {{sufficiently}} distinguishable. This verse and a half, {{and the one}} 'so unaffected, so composed a mind,' are characteristic, and the expression is true to nature; but they are, if I may take the liberty of saying it, the only parts of the epitaph which have this merit. Minute criticism is in its nature irksome, and as commonly practiced in books and conversation, is both irksome and injurious. Yet every mind must occasionally be exercised in this discipline, else it cannot learn the art of bringing words rigorously to the test of thoughts; and these again to a comparison with things, their archetypes, contemplated first in themselves, and secondly in relation to each other; in all which processes the mind must be skilful, otherwise it will be perpetually imposed upon. In the next couplet the word conquest, is applied {{in a manner that}} would have been displeasing even from its triteness in a copy of complimentary verses to a fashionable Beauty; but to talk of making conquests in an epitaph is not to be endured. 'No arts essayed, but not to be admired,'--are words expressing that she had recourse to artifices to conceal her amiable and admirable qualities; and the context implies that there was a merit in this; which surely no sane mind would allow. But the meaning of the Author, simply and honestly given, was nothing more than that she shunned admiration, probably with a more apprehensive modesty than was common; and more than this would have been inconsistent with the praise bestowed upon her--that she had an unaffected mind. This couplet is further objectionable, because the sense of love and peaceful admiration which such a character naturally inspires, is disturbed by an oblique and ill-timed stroke of satire. She is not praised so much as others are blamed, and is degraded by the Author in thus being made a covert or stalking-horse for gratifying a propensity the most abhorrent from her own nature--'Passion and pride were to her soul unknown.' It cannot be meant that she had no passions, but that they were moderate and kept in subordination to her reason; but the thought is not here expressed; nor is it clear that a conviction in the understanding that 'virtue only is our own,' though it might suppress her pride, would be itself competent to govern or abate many other affections and passions to which our frail nature is, and ought in various degrees, to be subject. In fact, the Author appears to have had no precise notion of his own meaning. If she was 'good without pretence,' it seems unnecessary to say that she was not proud. Dr. Johnson, making an exception of the verse, 'Convinced that virtue only is our own,' praises this epitaph for 'containing nothing taken from common places.' Now in fact, as may be deduced from the principles of this discourse, it is not only no fault but a primary requisite in an epitaph that <b>it</b> <b>shall</b> <b>contain</b> thoughts and feelings which are in their substance common-place, and even trite. It is grounded upon the universal intellectual property of man,--sensations which all men have felt and feel in some degree daily and hourly;--truths whose very interest and importance have caused them to be unattended to, as things which could take care of themselves. But it is required that these truths should be instinctively ejaculated or should rise irresistibly from circumstances; in a word that they should be uttered in such connection as shall make it felt that they are not adopted, not spoken by rote, but perceived in their whole compass with the freshness and clearness of an original intuition. The Writer must introduce the truth with such accompaniment as shall imply that he has mounted to the sources of things, penetrated the dark cavern from which the river that murmurs in every one's ear has flowed from generation to generation. The line 'Virtue only is our own,'--is objectionable, not from the common-placeness of the truth, but from the vapid manner in which it is conveyed. A similar sentiment is expressed with appropriate dignity in an epitaph by Chiabrera, where he makes the Archbishop of Albino say of himself, that he was ...|$|E

40|$|A Sponson bush {{belonging}} to an aircraft was forwarded to this laboratory for metallurgical analysis. It was requested {{to identify the}} specification of the material used by OEM. This exercise was taken up for indigenization of the component fabrication. After the necessary laboratory tests, {{it was found that}} the Sponson bush supplied by OEM was made of a precipitation hardenable martensite grade stainless steel. The chemical composition of the bush material was found to be similar to steels of specification MSRR 6647 or BSEM 548 or CUSTOM 450 (ASTM specification XM- 25). Analysis of the raw material (procured from the local vendor) conformed to the above specifications in terms of chemical composition. Microstructural study, however, showed that the raw material contained higher amount of delta ferrite (4 - 5 %) in comparison to that in the Sponson bush (delta ferrite not detectable). Heat treatment schedule to be adopted for achieving the strength level equivalent to that of the Sponson bush was determined through laboratory experiments, which is provided in this report. In summary, the raw material procured from the local vendor can be used as substitute for fabrication of the Sponson bush. However, it must be ascertained that the raw material is of premium aircraft-quality conforming to AMS 2300 0 r MAM 2300. The material shall be procured in solution annealed condition and <b>it</b> <b>shall</b> <b>contain</b> not more than 2 % delta ferrite in the microstructure...|$|E
40|$|From the {{equivalence}} principle, {{one gets}} {{the strength of the}} gravitational effect of a mass M on the metric at position r from it. It is proportional to the dimensionless parameter β^ 2 = 2 GM/rc^ 2, which normally is << 1. Here G is the gravitational constant, M the mass of the gravitating body, r the position of the metric from the gravitating body and c the speed of light. The seeable universe is the sphere, with center at the observer, having a size such that <b>it</b> <b>shall</b> <b>contain</b> all light emitted within it. For this to occur one can impose that the gravitational effect on the velocity of light at r is zero for the radial component, and non zero for the tangential one. Light is then trapped. The condition is given by the equality R_g = 2 GM/c^ 2, where R_g represents the radius of the seeable universe. It is the gravitational radius of the mass M. The result has been presented elsewhere as the condition for the universe to be treated as a black hole. According to present observations, for the case of our universe taken as flat (k = 0), and the equation of state as p = - ρ c^ 2, we prove here from the Einstein's cosmological equations that the universe is expanding in an accelerated way as t^ 2, a constant acceleration as has been observed. This implies that the gravitational radius of the universe (at the event horizon) expands as t^ 2. Taking c as constant, observing the galaxies deep in space this means deep in time as ct, linear. Then, far away galaxies from the observer that we see today will disappear in time as they get out of the distance ct that is < R_g. The accelerated expanding vacuum will drag them out of sight. This may be a valid test for the present ideas in cosmology. Previous calculations are here halved by our results. Comment: 15 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

40|$|Cities {{and urban}} regions {{especially}} in the West German agglomerations are characterised by an unbroken dynamic development, connected with changes in land use from undeveloped land into settlement areas and traffic zones up to the rural districts far from the cities. Environmental loads, e. g. negative environmental effects on air quality and noise, and adverse affects on valuable habitats are negative consequences of the growing of urban regions. On the other hand, cities and urban regions shall contribute to a sustainable spatial development as agreed to in the Agenda 21 and prescribed by the Regional Planning Law and the Federal Building Code. In order to turn the spatial development of cities and urban regions towards a sustainable spatial development, adequate planning and management instruments are required. The Directive of the European Union on {{the assessment of the}} effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment contains a framework, how the member states will have to take into consideration environmental aspects while drawing up or complementing certain plans and programmes. An environmental assessment shall be carried out for plans and programmes, which are likely to have significant environmental effects, e. g. for town and country planning and land use planning, and which set the framework for future development for projects submitted to an environmental impact assessment. The environmental assessment shall take into consideration reasonable alternatives including the zero-alternative. <b>It</b> <b>shall</b> <b>contain</b> a "screening" (necessity-check), a "scoping" (agreement on the scope of investigations), an "environmental report" and consultations of the public. The environmental report shall contain the analyse and evaluation of likely significant positive and negative effects on biodiversity, population and human health, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, cultural heritage including architectural and archaeological heritage. The Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply the Directive up to 2004. The discussion on the implementation of the EU Directive is in full swing. In Germany, each drawing up of a new land use plan or regional plan will require an environmental assessment. In the case of changes or amendments of those plans, it will depend a. o. on the extent and amount of environmental effects of the plan, whether an environmental assessment has to be carried out or not. Whether and how an environmental assessment can be integrated into spatial planning, and whether the landscape plans already carry out environmental assessments or have to be developed further is under discussion controversially. Further questions are e. g. how the subjects of the assessment shall be defined in detail, how results of the environmental assessment can be monitored, how the environmental assessment can be integrated into the planning procedures without taking many financial and personal resources, and how and at which extent the public shall be consulted. The lecture will focus on how the Directive can be realised by spatial and landscape planning, especially which methodical questions spatial and landscape planning will have to solve in order to implement an environmental assessment for plans and programmes according to the EU Directive. ...|$|E
