40|$|AbstractThe {{corrosion}} {{rate of the}} weathering steel is considerably {{lower than that of}} the standard carbon steel. In spite of this, possible effects of corrosion losses on reliable service of the structure throughout the designed service life should be considered when designing the structures. In practice, the effects of the expected corrosion losses are typically eliminated by <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowances</b> which are added to the thickness of the element calculated in static analyses. This paper introduces a new method used for calculation of <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowances.</b> The application of the procedure for calculation of <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowances</b> is explained using example of a bridge structure...|$|R

5000|$|A chain segment may be {{oversized}} {{so that at}} the end of its useful {{service life}} (around 20 years), the corroded chain is still above the minimum diameter required to meet the minimum break strength. This is called a <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> and accounts for the steel molecules lost through oxidation, erosion and wear, and Microbially Influenced Corrosion.|$|R
50|$|The {{selection}} of the materials from which the autoclave is fabricated turns entirely upon the application. For steam autoclaves, carbon steel is used, but a <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> {{is added to the}} calculated thickness. This accommodates the rusting that occurs with repeated cycles of exposure to steam, water, and air. Implicit in this is the need to monitor the loss of metal and decommission the vessel when excessive thickness loss has occurred.|$|R
40|$|The Liner is a {{composite}} sandwich construction using multiple layers of Owens Corning Advantex <b>extra</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistant fiberglass, forming a complex unidirectional reinforced structure. This construction achives an unmatched strenght permitting a thinner wall and therefore less reduction of the original diameter. The ring stiffness is very important. The unique design of the Liner gives a very high E-Moduls performance of 10. 000 MPa which is unmatched by any other liner on the market. The longitudial reinforcement ensures complete stability troughout the length and prevent any elongation caused by the installation process. The Liner is constructed using <b>extra</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistant fiberglass. The inside of the liner {{is covered with a}} polyester veil rich of resin, forming a very smooth and glass-hard surface. In Combination with the unique post-curing at 110 °C, a very high resistance to abrasion and chemicals is achieved...|$|R
50|$|Design {{involves}} parameters such as maximum safe {{operating pressure}} and temperature, safety factor, <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> and minimum design temperature (for brittle fracture). Construction is tested using nondestructive testing, such as ultrasonic testing, radiography, and pressure tests. Hydrostatic tests use water, but pneumatic tests use air or another gas. Hydrostatic testing is preferred, {{because it is}} a safer method, as much less energy is released if a fracture occurs during the test (water does not rapidly increase its volume when rapid depressurization occurs, unlike gases like air, which fail explosively).|$|R
40|$|Evaporators in big MSF-plants have {{traditionally}} been made of mild steel which should be cor-rosion resistant enough to cope with an environment of de-aerated seawater. However, experiences have proven that the environment is not always free of oxygen and corrosion has frequently occurred, especially during shut-down periods. One consequence is that a <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> has to be added and yet, protective layers in form of epoxy coatings and metallic linings are applied. Another alternative is to use solid stainless steel of the evaporator vessels. This paper will discuss {{the possibility of using}} two grades of ferritic-austenitic, or duplex, stainless steel for evaporators...|$|R

Samples of ESF invert concrete that have been crushed, or left intact but fractured, and that have been subjected to hydrothermal alteration will be used {{to determine}} the effect of cementitious materials on transport of radionuclides.

40|$|Abstract- The {{safety factor}} of a {{pressure}} vessel {{is related to}} both the tensile stress and yield strength for material allowance. ASME code section VIII has fully covered these two on the construction code for pressure vessel. This code section addressed mandatory and non-mandatory appendixes requirement, specific prohibition, vessel materials, design, fabrication, examination, inspection, testing, certification, and pressure relief. Mechanical design of a horizontal pressure vessel based on this standard had been done incorporating PV ELITE software. Analyses were carried out on head, shell, nozzle and saddle. The input parameters are type of material, pressure, temperature, diameter, and <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance.</b> Analysis performed the calculations of internal and external pressure, weight of the element, allowable stresses, vessel longitudinal stress check, nozzle check and saddle check...|$|R
40|$|Internal {{corrosion}} {{of carbon}} steel pipelines {{is a major}} problem encountered in water service. In terms of prediction of the remaining lifetime for water pipelines based on the <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance,</b> the three main approaches are corrosion modelling, corrosion inhibitor availability, and corrosion monitoring. In this study we used two theoretical corrosion models, CASSANDRA and NORSOK M- 506 of quite different origin in order to predict uniform corrosivity of hot aquifers in eight different pipelines. Because of the varying calculation criteria for the different models, these can give very different corrosion rate predictions for the same data input. This is especially true under conditions where the formation of protective films may occur, such as at elevated temperatures. The evaluation of models was conducted by comparison using weight-loss coupons and three corrosion inhibitors were obtained from commercial suppliers. The tests were performed during the 60 -day period. Even though inhibitors’ efficiencies of 98 % had been achieved in laboratory testing, inhibitors’ availabilities of 85 % have been used due to logistics problems and other issues. The results, given in mmpy, i. e. millimeter per year, are very consistent with NORSOK M- 506 prediction. This is presumably because the model considers the effect of the formation of a passive iron carbonate film at temperatures above 80 °C and significant reduction in corrosion rate. Corrosion inhibitor A showed a better performance than inhibitors B and C in all cases but the target corrosion rates of less than 0. 1 mmpy were achieved for all inhibitors. The chemical type of corrosion inhibitor A is based on quaternary amines mixed with methanol, isopropyl alcohol, xylene and ethylbenzene. Based on the obtained results the carbon steel lifetime of 30 years, provided proper inhibitors are present and 3 mm <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance,</b> can be achieved for hot aquifers service with presented water compositions...|$|R
40|$|Process {{safety is}} a task of {{preventing}} leaks. Leak prevention is critical because pressure vessels and piping assets in chemical plants are fabricated from materials which have limited corrosion resistance. When corrosive compounds are processed in these assets, they may suffer degradation over time due to thinning, cracking, or loss of their material properties. This problem is partially controlled by applying a safety margin known called a <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance.</b> The <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> is determined by predicting the asset?s expected corrosion rate and its service life. However, this fixed safety margin does not consider the inherent uncertainty in an individual asset?s degradation rate due to variability in the material?s corrosion resistance, the operating parameters of the process, and the inspection techniques {{used to measure the}} progression of corrosion damage over time. Consequently, deterministic analysis is not capable of precisely estimating an asset?s safe operating life during its design stage. One of the most likely areas for leakage to occur in process equipment is at the flange connections that join assets together. Risk analyses for planning inspections of fixed equipment and piping usually treat flanges as components of their parent asset. This thesis focuses on methods to improve prediction and control of corrosion and leakage at flange connections in particular. Flange connection seal tightness can be monitored through vibration-based Non-Destruction Testing (NDT). The data gathered from this monitoring can be used to update risk models for flange connection leakage. Hierarchical Bayesian Network methods of modeling risk are demonstrated in this thesis to be capable of predicting probability of seal failure based on the mean and variance of failure rates in a population of flange connections. This allows for prediction of the probabilities based on corrosion and leak events in the plant. The results of inspection techniques are used as inputs to this risk model, enabling probabilistic decision-making...|$|R
40|$|Oxidation and {{atmospheric}} corrosion {{data suggest that}} addition of Cr provides the greatest improvement in oxidation resistance. Cr-bearing cast irons are resistant to chloride environments and solutions containing strongly oxidizing constituents. Weathering steels, including high content and at least 0. 04 % Cu, appear to provide adequate resistance to oxidation under temperate conditions. However, data from long-term, high-temperature oxidation studies on weathering steels were not available. From the literature, {{it appears that the}} low alloy steels, plain carbon steels, cast steels, and cast irons con-ode at similar rates in an aqueous environment. Alloys containing more than 12 % Cr or 36 % Ni corrode at a lower rate than plain carbon steels, but pitting may be worse. Short term tests indicate that an alloy of 9 Cr- 1 Mo may result in increased corrosion resistance, however long term data are not available. Austenitic cast irons show the best corrosion resistance. A ranking of total corrosion performance of the materials from most corrosion resistant to least corrosion resistant is: Austenitic Cast Iron; 12 % Cr = 36 % Ni = 9 Cr- 1 Mo; Carbon Steel = Low Alloy Steels; and Cast Iron. Since the materials to be employed in the Advanced Conceptual Design (ACD) waste package are considered to be <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> materials, the austenitic cast irons, high Cr steels, high Ni steels and the high Cr-Mo steels should not be considered as candidates for the outer containment barrier. Based upon the oxidation and corrosion data available for carbon steels, low alloy steels, and cast irons, a suitable list of candidate materials for a <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> outer barrier for an ACD waste package could include, A 516, 2. 25 %Cr [...] 1 %Mo Steel, and A 27...|$|R

Corrosion rates may be described by a Weibull distribution function. Mean, standard deviation and maximum values of corrosion rates for structural members are obtained based on the entire population of the database.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{activity}} is to assess the long-term corrosion properties of metallic materials under consideration for fabricating waste package containers. Three classes of metals are to be assessed: corrosion resistant, intermediate corrosion resistant, and <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance.</b> <b>Corrosion</b> properties to be evaluated are general, pitting and crevice corrosion, stress-corrosion cracking, and galvanic corrosion. The performance of these materials will be investigated under conditions that are considered relevant to the potential emplacement site. Testing in four aqueous solutions, and vapor phases above them, and at two temperatures are planned for this activity. (The environmental conditions, test metals, and matrix are described in detail in Section 3. 0.) The purpose and objective of this activity is to obtain the kinetic and mechanistic information on degradation of metallic alloys currently being considered for waste package containers.

25|$|Accelerated {{low-water}} corrosion (ALWC) is {{a particularly}} aggressive form of MIC that affects steel piles in seawater near the low water tide mark. It is characterized by an orange sludge, which smells of hydrogen sulfide when treated with acid. Corrosion rates can be very high and design <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowances</b> can soon be exceeded leading to premature failure of the steel pile. Piles that have been coated and have cathodic protection installed {{at the time of}} construction are not susceptible to ALWC. For unprotected piles, sacrificial anodes can be installed locally to the affected areas to inhibit the corrosion or a complete retrofitted sacrificial anode system can be installed. Affected areas can also be treated using cathodic protection, using either sacrificial anodes or applying current to an inert anode to produce a calcareous deposit, which will help shield the metal from further attack.|$|R

40|$|A key {{component}} of the Engineered Barrier System (EBS) being designed for containment of spent-fuel and high-level waste at the proposed geological repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada is a two-layer canister. In this particular design,the inner barrier is made of a corrosion resistant material (CRM) such as Alloy 625 and C- 22, while the outer barrier is made of a <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> material (CAM) such as carbon steel or Monel 400. Initially, the containers will be hot and dry due to the heat generated by radioactive decay. However, the temperature will eventually drop to levels where both humid air and aqueous phase corrosion will be possible. As the outer barrier is penetrated, uniform corrosion of the CRM will be possible of exfoliated areas. The possibility of crevice formation between the CAM and CRM will also exist. In the case of either Alloy 625 or C- 22, a crevice will have to form before significant penetration of the CRM can occur. Crevice corrosion of the CRMs has been well documented...|$|R
40|$|Material {{selection}} {{is one of}} the important steps in designing of oil production units. The reason is that this step affects on two important parameters: cost and effective design. The main concern of this study is the material selection for all important equipment like: flow lines, separators, tanks and others for an Iranian oil field which now is developing and it's construction is going on right now. The plant produces 50000 BOPD whereas the final treatment plant will produce about 165000 BOPD. The crude oil is sour and has high pressure (140 MPa) and temperature (about 100 C). The crude contains some corrosive elements like H 2 S, CO 2 and water, of fluid coming from oil wells. For this reason the references that are used for this purpose are mainly NACE and API standards.

40|$|Wrought {{and cast}} {{low-carbon}} steel are candidate {{materials for the}} thick (e. g. 10 cm) outer barrier of nuclear waste packages being considered {{for use in the}} potential geological repository at Yucca Mountain. Dry oxidation is possible at the moderately elevated temperatures expected at the container surface (323 - 533 K or 50 - 260 C). Numerical predictions of dry oxidation damage were made based on experimental data for iron and low-carbon steel and parabolic oxidation theory. The Forward Euler method was implemented to integrate the parabolic rate law for arbitrary, complex temperature histories. Assuming growth of a defect-free, adherent oxide, the surface penetration of a low-carbon steel barrier following 5000 years of exposure to a severe, but repository-relevant, temperature history is predicted to be only about 0. 127 mm, less than 0. 13 % of the expected container thickness of 10 cm. Allowing the oxide to spall upon reaching a critical thickness increases the predicted metal penetration values, but degradation is still computed to be negligible. Thus, dry oxidation is not expected to significantly degrade the performance of thick, <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> barriers constructed of low-carbon steel...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPipeline {{material}} with internal cladding or liner of corrosion resistant material {{has become more}} customary in the later years {{as a replacement for}} carbon steel with high <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> due to the high corrosivity of unprocessed hydrocarbons. Clad material however, offer new challenges in the fracture assessment methodology due to inhomogeneous material, where the backing steel usually is low alloy carbon steel of 415 or 450 MPa yield stress and the clad layer basically has a significantly lower yield stress. In addition, the weld metal mechanical properties may only be partly overmatching compared to the base material. For operational conditions where the local material utilization exceeds the elastic limit, commonly used assessment methods based on analytical fracture models such as BS 7910 might be inadequate for clad pipelines, and more detailed finite element modeling must be performed. This paper addresses the relevant load scenarios for a clad steel pipeline installed by S-lay. A dedicated finite element program, LINKpipe has been used for the analyses to verify the acceptance criteria for defects in the girth welds. Input data for the analyses are taken from the detailed pipeline design calculations and material testing of the actual welding procedures of girth welds...|$|R
40|$|A long-term-testing facility, the Integrated Corrosion Facility (I. C. F.), {{is being}} {{developed}} to investigate the corrosion behavior of candidate construction materials for high-level-radioactive waste packages for the potential repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Corrosion phenomena will be characterized in environments considered possible under various scenarios of water contact with the waste packages. The testing of the materials will be conducted both in the liquid and high humidity vapor phases at 60 and 90 {degrees}C. Three classes of materials with different degrees of corrosion resistance will be investigated in order to encompass the various design configurations of waste packages.

A sufficient number of specimens will be emplaced in the test environments so that some can be removed and characterized periodically. The corrosion phenomena to be characterized are general, localized, galvanic, and stress corrosion cracking. The long-term data obtained from this study will be used in corrosion mechanism modeling, performance assessment, and waste package design. Three classes of materials are under consideration.

40|$|Independent {{of thermal}} loading scenarios, the waste {{packages}} at the proposed repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada {{will be exposed}} to environmental conditions of temperatures below 100 C {{with a range of}} possible relative humidities. Under high relative humidities, the formation of thin water films on the metal surfaces will occur. Previous work at ambient conditions has shown that on susceptible metals, the water-film-covered metal has an enhanced corrosion rate relative to the dry oxidation of the metal. The transition relative humidity where oxidation changes from dry oxidation to aqueous electrochemical corrosion is called the critical relative humidity. Determination of this transition is important in estimating the performance of the candidate materials (especially <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> materials), because of the marked increase in degradation rate above the critical relative humidity, typically 10 - 10 {sup 2 } times This activity is concerned with short term measurements of corrosion and oxidation rates using a high sensitivity microbalance. The experimental work will determine the critical humidity level for candidate metals under a variety of conditions. From the literature, the critical humidity level typically are around 70 % relative humidity, but this level is affected by the metal, gas composition, temperature, and the presence of contaminants on the surface, particularly contaminants that are deliquescent.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} factors impacting the performance of waste package container materials under repository relevant conditions is the thermal environment. This environment will be affected by the areal power density of the repository, which is dictated by facility design, and the dominant heat transfer mechanism at the site. The near-field environment will evolve as radioactive decay decreases the thermal output of each waste package. Recent calculations (Buscheck and Nitao, 1994) have addressed the importance of thermal loading conditions on waste package performance at the Yucca Mountain site. If a relatively low repository thermal loading design is employed, the temperature and relative humidity near the waste package may significantly affect the degradation of <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> barriers due to moist air oxidation and radiolytically enhanced corrosion.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} the Double-Shell Tank Thermal and Operating Loads Analysis (TaLA) combined with the Seismic Analysis. This combined analysis provides a thorough, defensible, and documented analysis that will {{become a part of the}} overall analysis of record for the Hanford double-shell tanks (DSTs). The bases of the analytical work presented herein are two ANSYS{reg_sign} finite element models that were developed to represent a bounding-case tank. The TaLA model includes the effects of temperature on material properties, creep, concrete cracking, and various waste and annulus pressure-loading conditions. The seismic model considers the interaction of the tanks with the surrounding soil including a range of soil properties, and the effects of the waste contents during a seismic event. The structural evaluations completed with the representative tank models do not reveal any structural deficiencies with the integrity of the DSTs. The analyses represent 60 years of use, which extends well beyond the current date. In addition, the temperature loads imposed on the model are significantly more severe than any service to date or proposed for the future. Bounding material properties were also selected to provide the most severe combinations. While the focus of the analyses was a bounding-case tank, it was necessary during various evaluations to conduct tank-specific analyses. The primary tank buckling evaluation was carried out on a tank-specific basis because of the sensitivity to waste height, specific gravity, tank wall thickness, and primary tank vapor space vacuum limit. For this analysis, the occurrence of maximum tank vacuum was classified as a service level C, emergency load condition. The only area of potential concern in the analysis was with the buckling evaluation of the AP tank, which showed the current limit on demand of l 2 -inch water gauge vacuum to exceed the allowable of 10. 4 inches. This determination was based on analysis at the design waste temperature of 350 F and the full 60 -year <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> on the tank wall of 0. 060 inch. However, analysis at a more realistic temperature of 250 F or <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> of 0. 025 inch results in an acceptable demand/capacity ratio according to the ASME code criteria. Thus, buckling of the primary tank is judged to be unlikely for the current lack of corrosion in the tanks, and the expectation that the maximum waste temperature will not exceed 210 F. The reinforced concrete structure was evaluated as specified by the American Concrete Institute (ACI) code requirements for nuclear safety-related structures (ACI- 349). The demand was demonstrated to be lower than the capacity at all locations. Revision 1 is being issued to document changes to the anchor bolt evaluation.

40|$|The Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project is {{concerned}} with the corrosion resistance of candidate engineered waste package materials. A variety of waste package designs have been proposed for US and Canadian High Level Nuclear Waste Repositories. A common feature of each design is the possibility of utilizing a corrosion resistant material such as a nickel-based super alloy or titanium-based alloy. A suitable corrosion resistant material may provide (a) kinetic immunity if the combination of repository environmental conditions and alloy resistance assure both: (i) a passive condition with negligible chance of localized corrosion stabilization, as well as (ii) low enough passive dissolution rates to insure conventional <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> over geological times, (b) a second form of ''corrosion allowance,'' if it can be scientifically demonstrated that a mechanism for stifling (i. e., death) of localized corrosion propagation occurs well before waste canisters are penetrated, or (c) such a low probability of initiation and continued propagation that a tolerably low degree of penetration occurs. Unfortunately, a large database on the crevice corrosion properties of alloy 22 does not exist in comparison to alloy 625. Alloy screening tests in oxidizing acids containing FeCl 3 indicate that alloy 22 is more resistant to crevice corrosion than 625 as indicated by critical pit and crevice temperatures.

Ceramic coatings deposited with high-velocity oxyfuels (HVOF� s) have exhibited a porosity of only 2 % at a thickness of 0. 15 cm. The primary goal of this document {{is to provide a}} detailed description of an abstracted process-level model for Total System Performance Assessment (TSPA) that has been developed to account for the inhibition of corrosion by protective ceramic coatings. A second goal was to address as many of the issues raised during a recent peer review as possible (direct reaction of liquid water with carbon steel, stress corrosion cracking of the ceramic coating, bending stresses in coatings of finite thickness, limitations of simple correction factors, etc.). During the periods of dry oxidation (T 2 100 °C) and humid-air corrosion (T I 100 °C & RH 80 %), it is assumed that the overall mass transfer resistance governing the corrosion rate is due to the combined resistance of ceramic coating & interfacial corrosion products. Two porosity models (simple cylinder & cylinder-sphere chain) are considered in estimation of the mass transfer resistance of the ceramic coating. It is evident that substantial impedance to 02 transport is encountered if pores are filled with liquid water. It may be possible to use a sealant to eliminate porosity. Spallation (rupture) of the ceramic coating is assumed to occur if the stress introduced by the expanding corrosion products at the ceramic- CAM interface exceeds fracture stress. Since this model does not account for the possibility of corrosion products filling pores, it is believe to be very conservative. In such a case, the corrosion product would not spread across the ceramic-CAM interface and no spallation would occur. Thus, the coating would be expected to last indefinitely...|$|R

The cost of building, manning, operating, maintaining and repairing a ship throughout its life is borne by society at large through market mechanisms. Gratsos and Zachariadis (2005) had investigated through a cost/benefit analysis how the average annual cost of ship transport varies with the corrosion additions elected at the design stage. The results of that paper clearly indicated that ships built with sufficient <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowances,</b> truly adequate for the ship's design life, have a lower life cycle cost per annum {{despite the fact that}} such ships would carry a slightly smaller quantity of cargo. Furthermore the safety and environmental benefits due to the reduced repairs and extended lifetime of such ships were briefly discussed. The debate of how ""robust"" a ship should be was also transferred to IMO in the context of Goal Based Standards following a submission by Japan which stated that the increased steel weight of a more robust ship will result in increased CO 2 emissions due to a reduced cargo carrying capacity. Greece replied by submitting a summary of the aforementioned paper and preliminary estimations on Life cycle CO 2 emissions disputing the Japanese contentions. However, taking onboard the challenge, an update is provided in the present paper, using the final Common Structural Rules (CSR) of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) bulk carrier corrosion margins and taking into account the major environmental implications of the heavier ship scantlings for two bulk carrier size brackets, Panamax and Handymax. The results show that the more robust ships would produce less CO 2 emissions over their lifetime. © 2010 : The Royal Institution of Naval Architects...|$|R
40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The electrochemistry of lead dioxide has been studied using the techniques of linear sweep voltammetry, potentiostatic pulse experiments and a. c. impedance measurements. A morphological examination was also carried out using the technique of scanning electron microscopy. The formation of lead dioxide was investigated on both the flat lead/lead alloy electrode and the porous electrode which was produced by oxidation of a standard automotive positive paste on a lead/lead alloy base. The electrochemistry of the pure lead electrode (both flat and porous) was investigated and the effect on this of various alloy additions was observed. The alloys used, all of potential industrial importance, were lead-antimony, lead-bismuth, lead-calcium-tin and lead-calcium-tin-bismuth at various levels of bismuth addition. An a. c. study of Pb-Ca-Sn-Mg-Al is also included. The effect of antimony addition to lead has been isolated as {{the production of a}} secondary oxidation layer. This provides an explanation for the superior active material retention of antimony containing grids in the lead-acid battery, the relatively large material development with the antimonial alloy giving rise to a more mechanically sound function between grid and paste. The formation of this <b>extra</b> <b>corrosion</b> layer on antimonial lead may also explain the high degree of top bar corrosion which occurs in the oxygen region of the battery. The commercial significance of bismuth as a grid alloying ingredient has been highlighted and'a useful bismuth concentration range determined for both lead and lead-calcium-tin alloys...|$|R
40|$|Pipelines are an {{essential}} part of the oil and gas industry as they are the main means of transportation. As the offshore technology advances, subsea pipelines are being operated in more demanding environments. For the pipelines to operate efficiently, they have to be carefully designed. One of the main threats to the integrity of the pipeline is corrosion, which has caused many failures. Corrosion in subsea pipelines has different forms and understanding their mechanisms is an important step in inhibiting them and decreasing their rate of occurrence. As corrosion is unavoidable, it is beneficial to be able to calculate the corrosion rate and the <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance.</b> By obtaining the results of the corrosion rate it becomes clearer which type of group of steel to consider for the fabrication of the pipeline. Different types of steels are used in the manufacturing of subsea pipelines. A part of this report focuses on explain the numbering systems and classification of the steels as they are divided into groups and subgroups. The chemical composition is the main character that separates them from each other, which is why the steel types perform differently when introduced to different corrosive environments. Within the commercial steel types, carbon steel is an attractive option to use for subsea pipelines. However, it is not always possible to use it due to the highly corrosive nature of the reservoirs. In that case corrosion resistant alloys are considered, as they posses higher corrosion resistance than conventional steel. One of the critical stages of pipeline design is the material selection process. Three projects with different parameters are presented as case studies. A simplified process of identifying wether carbon steel and certain corrosion resistant alloys are qualified for use in those projects is demonstrated. The process is based on corrosion rate calculations and continues to compare the different mechanical and corrosion resistance properties of corrosion resistant alloys...|$|R
40|$|Radioactive supernate, salt, and/or sludge wastes (i. e., {{high level}} wastes) are {{confined}} in 49 underground storage tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The waste is transported between tanks {{within and between}} the F and H area tank farms and other facilities on site via underground and {{a limited number of}} aboveground transfer lines. The Department of Energy - Savannah River Operations Office (DOE-SR) performed a comprehensive assessment of the structural integrity program for the Tank Farm waste transfer system at the SRS. This document addresses the following issues raised during the DOE assessment: (1) Inspections of failed or replaced transfer lines indicated that the wall thickness of some core and jacket piping is less than nominal; (2) No <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowance</b> is utilized in the transfer line structural qualification calculations. No basis for neglecting corrosion was provided in the calculations; (3) Wall loss due to erosion is not addressed in the transfer line structural qualification calculations; and (4) No basis is provided for neglecting intergranular stress corrosion cracking in the transfer line structural qualification calculations. The common theme in most of these issues is the need to assess the potential for occurrence of material degradation of the transfer line piping. The approach used to resolve these issues involved: (1) Review the design and specifications utilized to construct and fabricate the piping system; (2) Review degradation mechanisms for stainless steel and carbon steel and determine their relevance to the transfer line piping; (3) Review the transfer piping inspection data; (4) Life estimation calculations for the transfer lines; and (5) A Fitness-For-Service evaluation for one of the transfer line jackets. The evaluation concluded that the transfer line system piping has performed well for over fifty years. Although there have been instances of failures of the stainless steel core pipe during off-normal service, no significant degradation is anticipated during normal operations for the planned service life. General corrosion of stainless steel in high level waste environments was shown to be insignificant (i. e., little or no wall loss is expected for a time on the order of 180 years or more). Erosion is also not expected to limit the life of the pipes due to the low usage of the transfer lines and low fluid velocity during transfers. Quality controls on the material (e. g., corrosion evaluation testing) and procedures/specifications that limit contact with chloride bearing materials or liquids minimize the potential for the occurrence of stress corrosion cracking of the core pipe. General corrosion of the carbon steel jacket is not expected to be significant for a reasonable intended service life (e. g., on the order of 170 years). However, the carbon steel jackets are expected to continue to fail in local areas due to pitting corrosion. Life prediction estimates project that {{a significant increase in the}} number of jacket failures (i. e., through-wall penetrations) may occur after an additional 30 to 60 years of service life (i. e., between 2035 and 2065). A Fitness-For-Service evaluation was performed for a recently inspected jacket that showed evidence of pitting within a locally thinned area. The evaluation concluded that the line is still able to perform its intended function and can remain in service...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} corrosion studies, {{carbon steels}} and the alloy Ti 99. 8 -Pd {{were identified as}} promising materials for heat-generating nuclear waste containers that could act as a barrier for immobilization of radionuclides in a rock-salt repository. For this reason, these materials are subject to more detailed investigations. In the present study, the long-term corrosion behaviour of three preselected carbon steels has been investigated in the liquid and vapor phase of disposal relevant brines at 150 C- 170 C without radiation and {{in the presence of}} a gamma radiation field. Stress corrosion cracking studies (SCC) were also performed on the steels in an MgCl_ 2 -rich brine at 25 C- 170 C and slow strain rates of 10 "-" 4 - 10 "-" 7 s"-" 1. In addition to these laboratory-scale experiments, long-term in-situ experiments on Fe-base alloys, Ti 99. 8 -Pd and Hastelloy C 4 were performed in the Asse salt mine. Both metal sheets and tubes of these materials with selected container manufacturing characteristics (e. g. sealing technique, corrosion protection of steel with either Ti 99. 8 -Pd or Hastelloy C 4) were examined in rock salt and rock salt plus brine at 32 C- 200 C. Both in the liquid and in the vapor phase of the brines the steels investigated (unalloyed TStE 355 steel, low-alloyed TStE 460 and 15 MnNi 6. 3 steels) are resistant to pitting corrosion. The liquid-phase corrosion rates (36 - 71 #mu#m/a in NaCl-rich brine, 65 - 203 #mu#m/a in MgCl_ 2 -rich brines) are significantly higher than the vapor-phase corrosion rate (10 #mu#m/a), but they imply acceptable <b>corrosion</b> <b>allowances</b> for thick-walled containers. The gamma dose rate of 10 Gy/h and the submerged arc welding (SAW) do not accelerate the corrosion rates of the steels in NaCl-rich brine. In MgCl_ 2 -rich brines, the corrosion rates in the irradiated environment are a factor of about 1. 5 higher than in the unirradiated system. (orig. /MM) Bisherige Korrosionuntersuchungen ergaben, dass Kohlenstoffstaehle und die Legierung Ti 99. 8 -Pd aussichtsreiche Materialien fuer langzeitbestaendige Behaelter zur Endlagerung von waermeerzeugenden Abfaellen in Steinsalzformationen sind. Deshalb werden diese Werkstoffe detailliert untersucht. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde das Langzeit-Korrosionsverhalten von drei ausgewaehlten Staehlen in der Fluessig- und in der Dampfphase von endlagerrelevanten Salzloesungen bei 150 C- 170 C mit und ohne Gammastrahlenfeld untersucht. Darueber hinaus wurde die Bestaendigkeit der Staehle gegenueber Spannungsrisskorrosion (SpRK) in einer MgCl_ 2 -reichen Loesung bei 25 C- 170 C und langsamen Dehnungsraten von 10 "-" 4 - 10 "-" 7 s"-" 1 geprueft. Zusaetzlich zu den oben genannten Laborexperimenten wurden auch In-Situ-Experimente an Eisenbasislegierungen, Ti 99. 8 -Pd und Hastelloy C 4 im Salzbergwerk Asse durchgefuehrt. Neben Metallblechen wurden auch Rohrabschnitte aus diesen Materialien, versehen mit ausgewaehlten Herstellungsmerkmalen fuer Behaelter (z. B. Verschlusstechnik, Korrosionsschutz von Stahl durch Ti 99. 8 -Pd oder Hastelloy C 4), in Steinsalz bzw. Steinsalz plus Loesung bei T= 32 C- 200 C geprueft. Sowohl in der Fluessig- als auch in der Dampfphase der Loesungen sind die untersuchten Staehle (unlegierter Stahl TStE 355, niedriglegierte Staehle TStE 460 und 15 MnNi 6. 3) bestaendig gegenueber Lochkorrosion. In der Fluessigphase sind die linearen Korrosionsraten (36 - 71 #mu#m/a in der NaCl-reichen Loesung bzw. 65 - 203 #mu#m/a in den MgCl_ 2 -reichen Loesungen) deutlich hoeher als in der Dampfphase (10 #mu#m/a), jedoch fuehren die Werte zu technisch akzeptablen Behaelterkorrosionszuschlaegen. Ein Gammastrahlenfeld von 10 Gy/h und das Unterpulverschweissen fuehren zu keiner Erhoehung der Korrosionsraten der Staehle in der NaCl-reichen Loesung bei 150 C.
