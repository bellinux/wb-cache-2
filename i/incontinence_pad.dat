5000|$|An <b>incontinence</b> <b>pad</b> is a small, {{impermeable}} multi-layered {{sheet with}} high absorbency {{that is used}} in the incontinence and health-care industries as a precaution against urinary incontinence. It is generally made of cotton if washable or paper if disposable. The term may be used to refer to what are also known as [...] "incontinence diapers" [...] or [...] "incontinence nappies". Incontinence pads are usually placed in an undergarment or on a bed or chair under a person. Incontinence pads are manufactured in light and heavy grades which offer a range of absorbencies, often referred to as a 'working capacity', which refers to the true absorbency an <b>incontinence</b> <b>pad</b> offers when in use. These sorts of pads can come as panty-liners, inserts, pads or even available as replacement underwear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper reviews methods {{available}} for mapping {{the distribution of}} uid in <b>incontinence</b> <b>pad</b> materials to assist with evaluating existing products and developing new ones, and to provide data for building and validating predictive models. Specically, the following technologies are con-sidered and their strengths and limitations described: discrete sensors based on conductance, tempera-ture or optical measurements, optical imaging, gravimetric methods, X-ray imaging and magnetic resonance imaging. It is suggested that the ideal method would enable uid distribution to be mapped in three dimensions with good spatial and time resolution in single materials and composite structures of simple and complex geometries under static and dynamic mechanical loading. It would also allow liquid to be mapped in products when worn by users. It is concluded that, although each existing method meets some of these requirements, and each requirement is met, at least reasonably well, {{by at least one}} method, improved techniques are needed. The particular need for methods that can provide some measurement of liquid saturation within absorbent products, both in the laboratory and in real use, is highlighted. In many cases, simple methods used appropriately are sucient to elicit the important aspects of liquid transport and storage within absorbent products...|$|E
40|$|Friction is {{important}} {{across a wide}} range of applications. In particular, in health care, friction is thought to be the cause of some pressure ulcers in largely immobile patients, and abrasion due to friction contributes to the deterioration of skin health in <b>incontinence</b> <b>pad</b> users, especially in the presence of liquid. Some of these frictional forces are due to stress in materials wrapped around curved anatomical surfaces, which are often complicated shapes. The little work to date that has considered friction arising by this mechanism has assumed very simplified geometries (prisms, or even cylinders), which have enabled coefficients of friction to be extracted from laboratory tests on arms, but which are certainly not applicable to, for example, the diaper region. This work describes the development of a much more general mathematical model for friction between a draped, stressed sheet and the substrate, relating geometry, material mechanical properties and stress for essentially any convex surface. A general, wide, class of frictional interfaces is described (which includes those which obey Amontons ’ law), and the model is presented in differential form for a generic member of this class. Finally, an analytical solution is developed for convex, instantaneously rigid substrates isomorphic to the plane draped with a low-density sheet exhibiting no Poisson contraction, a fair approximation to some anatomical situations. The solution is explicitly calculated for a general prism and a general cone, producing expressions consistent with previous published models and with limited new experimental data. 1...|$|E

Patients and Methods: Twenty-one women, mean age 47. 4 years, with urodynamically diagnosed intrinsic sphincter deficiency were enrolled. They were assessed preoperatively by physical examination, QoL (King's Health Questionnaire), Stamey grading of <b>incontinence,</b> <b>pad</b> usage, 1 -hour pad-weight test, and urodynamic testing. Patients underwent periurethral injection of MIS under local anesthesia. After 24 -month follow-up, six patients were discharged from the group, and the remaining 15 patients were reassessed by means of objective and subjective parameters at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months after last treatment. Results: Patients' QoL improved in all domains throughout the study. The overall subjective success rate was 80 %. At 60 months, pad usage was reduced from a mean of 3. 5 /day to 0. 9 /day, and the 1 -hour pad weight decreased from 53. 8 to 5. 9 g. Valsalva leak-point pressure testing demonstrated a 73. 3 % rate of cure/improvement. There was no significant statistical difference assessed by Stamey grading and objective cure at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months of follow-up. The data showed a stable overall outcome from 6 to 60 months. Conclusion: The MIS produced promising long-term subjective and objective outcomes, as well as long-lasting improvements in QoL.

Methods: The data were obtained from the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice (DNSGP- 2). The {{aim of this}} survey was to give representative information on morbidity in the Dutch population, use of health services at patient level, health determinants and socio-demographic characteristics. Odds ratios, confidence intervals and p-values were calculated using the SAS-procedure PROC GLIMMIX (a multi logistic model). Results: Only 11. 6 % of all patients of 25 years and older with urinary incontinence was referred to a physiotherapist, 2. 4 % to a gynaecologist and 2. 9 % to an urologist. Besides, the number of female patients referred drops significantly after 60 years of age. In contrast, the number of <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads</b> prescribed increases significantly. Gender of the GP has no influence on prescription or referrals. Male patients were significantly less referred than female patients. Conclusion: We conclude that instead of prescribing <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads</b> the GP should refer more elderly patients to a physiotherapist. There is sufficient evidence that pelvic floor muscle training and bladder training work.

Patients and Methods: Twenty-one consecutive women {{with a mean age of}} 47. 4 years and a mean body mass index 26. 16 kg/m(2) having urodynamically diagnosed intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) were enrolled. Patients were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively by physical examination, Stamey grading of <b>incontinence,</b> <b>pad</b> usage, pad weight test, and urodynamic measurements. Quality of life was assessed by the King's Health Questionnaire. Patients underwent transurethral injection of the MIS under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis. The mean volume injected was 6. 3 mL. The data presented are based on 24 -month follow-up from the last injection, and the patients were considered their own controls. Results: Patient QoL improved in all domains. Ten patients (47 %) considered themselves cured; three (14. 3 %) thought they were improved, and eight (38. 1 %) believed the procedure had failed. According to the subjective surgeon Stamey grading, 8 patients (38. 1 %) were considered cured, 5 (23. 8 %) improved, and 8 (38. 1 %) failed. Daily pad usage was reduced from a mean of 4. 38 to 1. 47. According to the pad weight test, 12 patients (57. 1 %) were dry and two (9. 5 %) improved, while in 7 (33. 3 %), MIS failed. Urodynamic testing demonstrated 10 patients (50 %) dry and 5 (25 %) improved. Conclusion: The MIS proved to have an outcome acceptable to patients and surgeons at 24 -month follow-up.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundMirabegron, a first-in-class {{selective}} oral β 3 -adrenoceptor agonist, {{has similar}} efficacy to most antimuscarinic agents {{and a lower}} incidence of dry mouth in patients with overactive bladder (OAB). ObjectivesTo evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mirabegron 50 mg compared with oral antimuscarinic agents in adults with OAB from a UK National Health Service perspective. MethodsA Markov model including health states for symptom severity, treatment status, and adverse events was developed. Cycle length was 1 month, and the time horizon was 5 years. Antimuscarinic comparators were tolterodine extended release, solifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin extended release and immediate release (IR), darifenacin, and trospium chloride modified release. Transition probabilities for symptom severity levels and adverse events were estimated from a mirabegron trial and a mixed treatment comparison. Estimates for other inputs were obtained from published literature or expert opinion. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and total health care costs, including costs of drug acquisition, physician visits, <b>incontinence</b> <b>pad</b> use, and botox injections, were modeled. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. ResultsBase-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from £ 367 (vs. solifenacin 10 mg) to £ 15, 593 (vs. oxybutynin IR 10 mg) per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £ 20, 000 /QALY gained, the probability of mirabegron 50 mg being cost-effective ranged from 70. 2 % versus oxybutynin IR 10 mg to 97. 8 % versus darifenacin 15 mg. A limitation of our analysis is the uncertainty {{due to the lack}} of direct comparisons of mirabegron with other agents; a mixed treatment comparison using rigorous methodology provided the data for the analysis, but the studies involved showed heterogeneity. ConclusionsMirabegron 50 mg appears to be cost-effective compared with standard oral antimuscarinic agents for the treatment of adults with OAB from a UK National Health Service perspective...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND:Neurogenic {{detrusor}} overactivity (NDO) {{leads to}} impaired health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQoL), productivity, and greater healthcare resource burden. The humanistic and economic burden may be more apparent in NDO patients with urinary incontinence (UI). The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the HRQoL, productivity, and health resource use (HRU) between continent and incontinent NDO patients. METHODS:A retrospective database analysis was conducted using the Adelphi Overactive Bladder (OAB) /UI Disease Specific Programme, a multi-national, cross-sectional survey reported from both patients' and physicians' perspectives. The population for this analysis included NDO patients with or without UI. General and disease-specific HRQoL were assessed using the EuroQoL- 5 D (EQ- 5 D), Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaire (I-QOL), and the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q). Productivity and daily activity impairment were measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire. HRU indicators included OAB-related surgery, OAB-related hospitalizations, <b>incontinence</b> <b>pad</b> usage, switching anticholinergics used for OAB due to inadequate response or adverse effects, and OAB-related physician visits. Bivariate analyses, multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses and published minimal clinically important differences (MCID) were used to assess relationships between incontinent status and the aforementioned outcome measures. RESULTS:A total of 324 NDO patients with or without urinary incontinence were included, averaging 54 years of age (SD 16), of whom 43. 8 percent were male. Bivariate analyses detected no significant relationship between incontinent status and HRU variables. Regression analyses revealed that incontinent patients had clinically and statistically lower disease-specific HRQoL and greater impairment in daily activities as compared to continent patients. On average, incontinent patients scored 10 points lower on the I-QOL total score, 9 points lower on the OAB-q HRQoL score, 15 points higher on OAB-q symptom severity, and experienced 8. 2 percent higher activity impairment due to their bladder condition (all p < 0. 001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to provide insight into the {{referral}} pattern of newly diagnosed patients with urinary incontinence in general practice and into the prescription of medication and <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads</b> by general practitioners (GPs). We also examined the influence of gender and age of patient/GP on these patterns. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice. We used registered new episodes for urinary incontinence of patients of 25 years and older in the year 2001 and examined the initial management. RESULTS: Twelve per cent of the patients were referred to a physiotherapist, 2. 4 % to a gynaecologist and 2. 9 % to a urologist. Medication was prescribed to 9. 8 % and 12. 7 % received <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads.</b> The number of female patients referred decreased significantly after 60 years of age and the number of <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads</b> and medication prescribed was higher in this age patient group. Gender of the GP did not influence the prescription or referral rate. Male patients were significantly less frequently referred than female patients. CONCLUSION: The lower referral rate and higher prescription rate of <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads</b> and medication at older age indicate that GPs are not sufficiently aware of the benefits of pelvic floor muscle training and bladder training at older age. We did not find an influence of gender of the GP on management of urinary incontinence, unlike previous research.

Sixty-one outpatient clinics in Europe, Israel, and Turkey. Seven hundred ninety-four individuals aged 65 and older (47 % male) with OAB symptoms for 3 months or longer, mean of eight or more micturitions {{and three or more}} urgency episodes per 24 hours, at least some moderate problems on Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 20 or greater. Participants were randomized to fesoterodine or placebo for 12 weeks, with stratification according to age (> 75 vs ≤ 75) and dosing time (morning vs evening). Participants receiving fesoterodine started on 4 mg and could increase to 8 mg at week 4 or 8 and de-escalate to 4 mg at week 8 (sham escalation for placebo). Changes from baseline in bladder-diary variables (primary endpoint, urgency episodes) and patient-reported outcomes including OAB Questionnaire, Treatment Benefit Scale (TBS), PPBC, Urgency Perception Scale (UPS), and OAB Satisfaction Questionnaire (OAB-S); all observed or reported adverse events. By week 8, 64 % of fesoterodine-treated and 71 % of placebo-treated participants opted for dose escalation. At week 12, the fesoterodine group had statistically significantly greater improvement than the placebo group in urgency episodes, micturitions, nocturnal micturitions, <b>incontinence</b> <b>pad</b> use, and OAB Questionnaire scores but not urgency urinary incontinence episodes. Responder rates on TBS, PPBC, UPS, and OAB-S were statistically significantly higher with fesoterodine.

40|$|PURPOSE: The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) among nursing home–based <b>incontinence</b> <b>pad</b> users varies between pad designs. A second aim was to examine the utility of a simple method for reporting skin health problems in which healthcare assistants were asked to record basic observational data at each pad change. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, multiple crossover, observational, exploratory. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Twenty-one men and 57 women using absorbent continence products to contain urinary and/or fecal incontinence were recruited from 10 nursing homes in London and the south of England. METHODS: A day-time variant and a night-time variant of each of the 4 main disposable pad designs on the market for moderate/heavy incontinence were tested: (1) insert pads with stretch pants; (2) 1 -piece all-in-one diapers; (3) pull-up pants; and (4) belted/T-shape diapers. All pad variants for day-time use had an absorption capacity of 1900 mL ± 20 % (measured using ISO 11948 - 1 International Standards Organization) while the capacity of night-time variants was 2400 mL ± 20 %. Each resident used each of the 4 pad designs (day-time and night-time variants) for 2 weeks and the order of testing was randomized by nursing home. Skin health data were collected using 2 methods in parallel. Method 1 comprised visual observation by researchers (1 observation per pad design; 4 observations in total over 8 weeks). In method 2, healthcare assistants logged observational data on skin health at every pad change for the 8 weeks. The primary outcome variable was severity of the most severe skin problem noted by the researcher for each resident, and for each pad design (method 1). Descriptive data on skin care methods used in the nursing homes were also collected using short questionnaires and researcher observation. RESULTS: No significant differences in the severity or incidence of skin problems were found between observations using the 4 pad designs. However, a wide range of skin conditions was recorded that made classification difficult; the skin was often marked with creases from absorbent products, temporary marks, and pink/purple discoloration. We observed few cases of the severe erythema, rashes, and vesicles that are commonly used descriptors in previous skin tools. Nevertheless, the collected data reflect an abundance of skin problems that were difficult to categorize neatly. Researcher observations (method 1) showed that nearly all the residents (96 %) had at least 1 IAD skin problem recorded over the 8 -week period and 64 % of residents had at least 1 problem that was rated as maximum severity. Healthcare assistants logged skin problems on 6. 1 % of pad changes. The discrepancy between researcher and healthcare assistant data appears to be largely due to healthcare assistants sometimes discounting low-grade IAD as normal for that population. CONCLUSION: Incontinence-associated dermatitis is common among nursing home residents who use incontinence pads, and it is often severe. No evidence was found that any design of pad was more likely than any others to be associated with skin problems. The method devised to enable healthcare assistants to record basic observational data on skin health in the diaper area at each pad change (Method 2) proved simple to use but still resulted in substantial underreporting of IAD, suggesting that further work is needed to develop a tool that more successfully encourages them to log and treat IAD problems...|$|E

40|$|Many {{elderly people}} {{entering}} residential or nursing care are already incontinent to some degree, relying on <b>incontinence</b> <b>pads</b> {{to deal with}} the consequences.
