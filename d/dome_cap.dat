50|$|For {{swimming}} competition, different swimmers {{use different}} types of caps. The most common being made of silicone. cap. When at a swim meet, a coach will normally provide the swimmer with a latex cap with the club logo. As one gets into more serious swimming, the use of dome caps may come into play. A <b>dome</b> <b>cap</b> is a swimming cap that is very tight and has internal structure to ensure that your head is completely smooth. This is done to decrease drag that lumps of hair sticking up in a normal cap may cause. Therefore, dome caps become very popular {{when it comes to}} very large national swimming meets.|$|E
50|$|The {{octagonal}} {{shape of}} this 18th-century tower mill is distinctly unusual; {{there are only}} two or three such towers in the UK. The tower has three storeys. There are two fireplaces on the ground floor (some mills only had one, and others none at all) and a properly framed staircase leads to the 'stone floor', i.e. the first floor, where the mill stones are set. The original curved <b>dome</b> <b>cap</b> was copper clad and has been described as being 'picturesque without being elegant'.There were originally four sails (which turned clockwise rather than the more usual anti-clock) but for a time the windmill operated on two sails only. These were of the 'common' type with a wooden frame rigged with canvas which could be set according to the state of the wind and the amount of work the miller had to do. The canvas used was similar to that used on Thames barges.|$|E

40|$|Petrographic and SEM {{study of}} flu vial-deltaic {{sections}} of the Woodbine Group in the East Texas Basin indicates that authigenic mineral suites are controlled, in part, {{by the presence of}} organic-rich matrix. During early, precompaction diagenesis, organic matter supplied the metabolic fuel required by sulfate-reducing bacteria to reduce sulfate in depositional waters ultimately to pyrite. With burial the sulfate supply was ultimately exhausted, and bicarbonate activity thereafter controlled the precipitation of siderite and Fe-calcite. Matrix material supplied the components and reaction sites for the most import ant porosity-occluding reaction: kaolinite [...] 3 ̆e Fe,M g chlorite. Matrix physically inhibited the growth of quartz overgrowths, yet, through compaction and as a product of the above reaction, provided a supply of silica for quartz cementation. Dissolution of salt <b>dome</b> <b>cap</b> rock has played a minor role in the cementation of the Woodbine in the East Texas Basin. Pore-filling calcite, barite, and pyrite were observed in the Woodbine where the Woodbine is in direct hydraulic communication with salt <b>dome</b> <b>cap</b> rock. In the deep, central portion of the basin Na-Cl brine resulting from salt-dome dissolution is evolving toward a Na-Ca(Mg) -Cl brine. The evolution of the brine chemistry {{may be the result of}} cation exchange on clay minerals, albitization of plagioclase feldspars, or the dissolution of magnesium - and calcium- chloride-rich phases. The present study could not confirm any of these reactions. WATEQF was used to calculate mineral-saturation states in Woodbine waters. Program output appears to represent accurately in situ individual mineral-saturation states at measured pH, as confirmed by petrographic and SEM identification of authigenic minerals. Relative stability between mineral pairs can be tested with thermodynamically-derived activity diagrams for the mineral pairs...|$|E

50|$|The {{direct cause}} of the heat is that, under high pressure, the air {{subsides}} (sinks) toward the surface. This sinking air acts as a <b>dome</b> <b>capping</b> the atmosphere. This cap helps to trap heat instead of allowing it to lift. Without the lift {{there is little or}} no convection and therefore little or no convective clouds (cumulus clouds) with minimal chances for rain. The end result is a continual build-up of heat at the surface resulting in drought conditions over wide areas.|$|R

50|$|Summertime weather {{patterns}} are generally slower to change than in winter. As a result, this upper level high pressure also moves slowly. Under high pressure, the air subsides (sinks) toward the surface, warming and drying adiabatically. This warmer sinking air creates {{a high level}} inversion {{that acts as a}} <b>dome</b> <b>capping</b> the atmosphere, inhibiting convection, thereby trapping high humidity warm air below it. Typically, convection is present along the periphery of the cap where the pressure becomes less. This peripheral convection, however, can add to the high pressure dome by ventilating the upper level outflow of the thunderstorms into it. The end result is a continual build-up of heat at the surface that people experience as a heat wave.|$|R

40|$|Crystal {{fabric and}} texture data are {{presented}} from ten ice cores that have previously been drilled along an approximate flow line {{extending from the}} summit of Law <b>Dome</b> ice <b>cap</b> to Cape Folger, East Antarctica. Our interest in these data is their interpretation in terms of stress patterns within the ice cap, {{and in particular the}} detection of the depths at which the stress changes from predominantly near-vertical compression to predominantly near-horizontal simple shear zones. This transition potentially marks an increase in flow rate, from a factor of ～ 3 in the compression zone to ～ 10 in the shear zone, compared to deformation of the initially isotropic ice that accumulates at the surface.
