40|$|AbstractGsMTx 4, a gating {{modifier}} peptide {{acting on}} cationic mechanosensitive channels, {{has a positive}} charge (+ 5 e) due to six Lys residues. The peptide {{does not have a}} stereospecific binding site on the channel but acts from the boundary lipids within a Debye length of the pore probably by changing local stress. To gain insight into how these Lys residues interact with membranes, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of Lys to Glu mutants in parallel with our experimental work. In silico, K 15 E had higher affinity for 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine bilayers than wild-type (WT) peptide or any other mutant tested, and showed deeper penetration than WT, a finding consistent with the experimental data. Experimentally, the inhibitory activities of K 15 E and K 25 E were most compromised, whereas K 8 E and K 28 E inhibitory activities remained similar to WT peptide. Binding of WT in an interfacial mode did not influence membrane thickness. With interfacial binding, the direction of the dipole moments of K 15 E and K 25 E was predicted to differ from WT, whereas those of K 8 E and K 28 E oriented similarly to that of WT. These results support a model in which binding of GsMTx 4 to the membrane acts like an immersible wedge that serves as a membrane <b>expansion</b> <b>buffer</b> reducing local stress and thus inhibiting channel activity. In simulations, membrane-bound WT attracted other WT peptides to form aggregates. This may account for the positive cooperativity observed in the ion channel experiments. The Lys residues seem to fine-tune the depth of membrane binding, the tilt angle, and the dipole moments...|$|E
30|$|Chiang Mai was {{the capital}} of Lan Na kingdom. It found in 1296, {{historic}} area of Chiang Mai has plentiful of historic contents from being the center of converging, merging and conflict in geo-politic aspects. After defeated Haripunchai (Lamphun), Phraya Mengrai established ‘Vieng Khum Kham’ then ‘Vieng Chiang Mai’, respectively (Ongsakul 2010). Firstly, Vieng Khum Kham influence by Lamphun capital of Haripunchai kingdom, somehow, it relocated to Chiang Mai due to natural and geography suitability. Unlike other cities in Phraya Mengrai dynasty, Chiang Mai appointed to be Lan Na capital from the start (The 9 th Infantry division 2006; Forbes and Henley 2012). To create the capital city, a new concept of the city need to be included, by that time, founders of Chiang Mai and Sukhothai was consulted to establish and lay concept of city shape that indicates as a symbolic and spiritual center of Lan Na kingdom (Guntang 1990; Tansukanun and Duangthima 2013). Location of Chiang Mai situates on fertile lowland in the mountain-river basin. Chiang Mai location also substantial retreat from the river due to protection from flooding and <b>expansion</b> <b>buffer.</b> Chiang Mai historic area has the significantly geometric square shape where eastern direction adjacent to the main river, western direction adjacent to the mountain that creates a natural wall to protect the city from invaders. Notice by its shape, it highly influences by Sukhothai geometric shape which also shows respects to east–west direction. Moreover, in Buddhism concept of ‘Traiphum’, Chiang Mai zoning determination divide into hierarchy usage to separate land use depend on residents’ social status. From this significant separation, it shows adopted the idea of ‘Traiphum’ suitable to emphasize capital city and simultaneously provide the semi-god status of ruler dynastic through sacred boundary (Jumsai 2008). However, during counter-colonial and pre-modernization of Thailand by centralization policy, some important spaces in historic area replaced by central government offices or quarters such as city hall, post office, city court and even jailhouse (Jarernmuang and Apavajaruta 1986). This movement, still, shows its evident in the recent day, therefore, religious spaces such as temples was immune from replacement due to its religious status and mostly situated in the same location since established period.|$|E

40|$|A burst {{compression}} and expansion technique is described for asynchronously interconnecting variable-data-rate users with cost-efficient ground terminals in a satellite-switched, time-division-multiple-access (SS/TDMA) network. Compression and <b>expansion</b> <b>buffers</b> in each ground terminal convert between lower rate, asynchronous, continuous-user data streams and higher-rate TDMA bursts synchronized with the satellite-switched timing.

A continuous range of data rates from kilobits per second to that approaching the modulator burst rate (hundreds of megabits per second) can be accommodated. The technique was developed for use in the NASA Lewis Research Center System Integration, Test, and Evaluation (SITE) facility. Some key features of the technique have also been implemented in the ground terminals developed at NASA Lewis for use in on-orbit evaluation of the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) high burst rate (HBR) system...|$|R

Abstract – Mechanisms of conductor fracture and generation of nanosized metal particles at electric explosion (EEC) are discussed. It was determined that fracture of polycrystalline conductors with crystallite size less than 100 nm at fast input of electromagnetic energy occurs in consequence of its localization in area of intercrystalline boundaries.

The majority of studies on Chinese urbanization have been focused on coastal areas, while with less attention given to urban centers in the west. Chengdu, western China, however is undergoing significant urban growth due to rapid economic development and demographic growth. This research examines urban expansion in Chengdu based on remotely sensed data, urban <b>expansion</b> model, <b>buffer</b> analysis of geographic information system (GIS) and quadrant orientation analysis. Driving forces of urban expansion are also examined based on principle component analysis (PCA). Results indicate that the urbanized area {{increased by more than}} 17 times, up to 1910. 2 km 2 from 1978 to 2010, the urban expansion rate and intensity increased significantly and exhibited the spatiotemporal heterogeneity. We found that urban expansion patterns changed from patch infilling to patch margin expansion, and the expansion direction is primarily toward the northwest, west and southwest. The results suggest an obvious trend of urban expansion in Chengdu witnessed in coastal cities of China.

50|$|There {{were four}} main motivations for the Soviet {{invasion}} in Afghanistan in 1979. First, the Soviets strategic importance of Afghanistan for security measures. Throughout Russian history, Russia {{has always been}} wary of neighboring countries and keeps their borders safe through <b>expansion,</b> or obtaining <b>buffer</b> states. The second reason was, the possibility of disrupting anti-Soviet nations, such as America and China. The third reason for invasion was to spread Marxist-Leninist revolutionary ideals. Lastly, the Soviets invaded for raw materials and inexpensive manufactured goods. These factors led to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Around this time, the Soviets were also having success in other Middle Eastern areas, such as the Horn of Arabia and {{in the southern part}} of the Arabian Peninsula. The Soviet Union took almost universal condemnation after this invasion.|$|R

40|$|Analysis {{of urban}} {{distribution}} and its expansion using remote sensing data has received increasing {{attention in the}} past three decades, but little research has examined spatial patterns of urban distribution and <b>expansion</b> with <b>buffer</b> zones in different directions. This research selected Hangzhou metropolis as a case study to analyze spatial patterns and dynamic changes based on time-series urban impervious surface area (ISA) datasets. ISA was developed from Landsat imagery between 1991 and 2014 using a hybrid approach consisting of linear spectral mixture analysis, decision tree classifiers, and post-processing. The spatial patterns of ISA distribution and its dynamic changes in eight directions—east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, north, and northeast—at the temporal scale were analyzed with a buffer zone-based approach. This research indicated that ISA can be extracted from Landsat imagery with both producer and user accuracies of over 90 %. ISA in Hangzhou metropolis increased from 146 km 2 in 1991 to 868 km 2 in 2014. Annual ISA growth rates were between 15. 6 km 2 and 48. 8 km 2 with the lowest growth rate in 1994 – 2000 and the highest growth rate in 2005 – 2010. Urban ISA increase before 2000 was mainly due to infilling within the urban landscape, and, after 2005, due to urban expansion in the urban-rural interfaces. Urban expansion in this study area has different characteristics in various directions that are influenced by topographic factors and urban development policies...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} {{comprehensive}} theoretical framework for describing {{the dynamics of}} a single trapped ion interacting with a neutral buffer gas, thus extending our previous studies on buffer-gas cooling of ions beyond the critical mass ratio [B.

By transforming the collisional processes into a frame, where the ion's micromotion is assigned to the buffer gas atoms, our model allows one to investigate the influence of non-homogeneous buffer gas configurations as well as higher multipole orders of the radio-frequency trap in great detail. Depending on the neutral-to-ion mass ratio, three regimes of sympathetic cooling are identified which are characterized by {{the form of the}} ion's energy distribution in equilibrium.

40|$|The {{effects of}} medium pH on cell {{expansion}} and tracheary element (TE) differentiation were investigated in differentiating mesophyll suspension cultures of Zinnia elegans L. In unbuffered cultures initially adjusted to pH 5. 5, the medium pH fluctuated reproducibly, decreasing about 1 unit {{prior to the}} onset of TE differentiation and then increasing when the initiation of new Tes was complete. Elimination of large pH fluctuations by buffering the culture medium with 20 mM 2 -(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid altered both cell expansion and TE differentiation, whereas altering the starting pH of unbuffered culture medium {{had no effect on}} either process. Cell <b>expansion</b> in <b>buffered</b> cultures was pH dependent with an optimum of 5. 5 to 6. 0. The direction of cell expansion was also pH dependent in buffered cultures. Cells elongated at pH 5. 5 to 6. 0, whereas isodiametric cell expansion was predominant at pH 6. 5 to 7. 0. The onset of TE differentiation was delayed when the pH was buffered higher or lower than 5. 0. However, TEs eventually appeared in cultures buffered at pH 6. 5 to 7. 0, indicating that a decrease in pH to 5. 0 is not necessary for differentiation. Very large TEs with secondary cell wall thickenings resembling metaxylem differentiated in cultures buffered at pH 5. 5 to 6. 0, which also showed the greatest cell expansion. The correlation between cell expansion and delayed differentiation of large, metaxylem-like TEs may indicate a link between the regulatory mechanisms controlling cell expansion and TE differentiation...|$|R

The effects of composition {{in the bond}} coat and feedstock purity for the buffer layer on its lifetime performance were also examined. To overcome the drawbacks of Yb-Gd-Y-based material with inferior thermal durability due to poor mechanical properties and low coefficient of thermal <b>expansion,</b> a <b>buffer</b> layer {{was introduced in the}} Yb-Gd-Y-based TBC systems. In FCTF tests, the TBCs with the buffer layer showed a longer lifetime performance than those without the buffer layer, showing the longest thermal durability in the TBC with the Co-Ni-based bond coat and the buffer layer of regular purity. In JETS tests, the TBC with the Ni-based bond coat and the buffer layer of high purity showed a sound condition after 2000 cycles, showing better thermal durability for TBC with the Co-Ni-based bond coat rather than that with the Ni-based bond coat in the single layer coating without the buffer layer. The buffer layer effectively enhanced the thermal durability in slow temperature change (in the FCTF test), while the bond-coat composition and the feedstock purity for the buffer layer were found to be important factor to improve the thermal durability of the TBC in fast temperature change (in the JEET test). Finally, these research findings allow us to control the structure, composition, and feedstock purity in TBC system for improving the thermal durability in cyclic thermal environments...|$|R

50|$|In an Advanced Primer Ignition Blowback design {{such as the}} MK 108, {{this problem}} is {{prevented}} by using a longer chamber, which allows the cartridge {{to enter into the}} chamber a small distance past the breech face. When the trigger is pressed, the bolt is moved forward by <b>expansion</b> of the <b>buffer</b> spring. It chambers the cartridge, but instead of coming to rest against the breech face, it follows the case a small distance into the chamber. A cartridge case with a rebated rim is used, so that the extractor claw can hook over the rim and still fit within the chamber. Primer ignition is timed so that the bolt is still moving forward when the propellant is ignited. The expanding gases from the fired round stop the forward motion of the bolt, then reverse its motion, expelling it from the chamber, along with the spent cartridge case, which, as the bolt moves rearward, strikes the ejector, throwing it from the mechanism. The heavy bolt continues rearward, compressing the buffer spring, which then expands, pushing the bolt forward again, picking up a fresh cartridge from the magazine (or belt in a belt-fed weapon) and chambering it. This cycle of events continues until the trigger is released. Before this sequence of events occurs, the projectile has already left the muzzle, allowing the propellant gas to escape, reducing the chamber pressure to a safe level.|$|R
40|$|I {{review the}} problem of motion for small bodies in general relativity, with an {{emphasis}} on developing a self-consistent treatment of the gravitational self-force. An analysis of the various derivations extant in the literature leads me to formulate an asymptotic expansion in which the metric is expanded while a representative worldline is held fixed. I discuss the utility of this expansion for both exact point particles and asymptotically small bodies, contrasting it with a regular expansion in which both the metric and the worldline are expanded. Based on these preliminary analyses, I present a general method of deriving self-consistent equations of motion for arbitrarily structured (sufficiently compact) small bodies. My method utilizes two expansions: an inner expansion that keeps the size of the body fixed, and an outer expansion that lets the body shrink while holding its worldline fixed. By imposing the Lorenz gauge, I express the global solution to the Einstein equation in the outer expansion in terms of an integral over a worldtube of small radius surrounding the body. Appropriate boundary data on the tube are determined from a local-in-space <b>expansion</b> in a <b>buffer</b> region where both the inner and outer expansions are valid. This buffer-region expansion also results in an expression for the self-force in terms of irreducible pieces of the metric perturbation on the worldline. Based on the global solution, these pieces of the perturbation can be written in terms of a tail integral over the body’s past history. This approach can be applied at any order to obtain a self-consistent approximation that is valid on long time scales, both near and far from the small body. I conclude by discussing possible extensions of my method and comparing it to alternative approaches...|$|R
40|$|This report summarises the set-up, {{operation}} and observations {{from the first}} 2890 days (7. 9 years) of the large scale gas injection test (Lasgit) experiment conducted at the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory. During this time the bentonite buffer has been artificially hydrated and has given new insight into {{the evolution of the}} buffer. Three gas injection tests have been conducted during the duration of Lasgit. The first two tests were conducted in the lower array of injection filters at FL 903. Both of these tests showed similar behaviour with a well-defined pressure peak; spontaneous negative transient; evidence of dynamic behaviour and unstable gas pathways; asymptote close to stress. The results were remarkably qualitatively similar to the laboratory test results. However, the high gas entry pressures seen in the laboratory were not seen in Lasgit as stress state is much lower due to non-complete hydration of the <b>buffer</b> and the <b>expansion</b> of the <b>buffer</b> to fill construction voids. The third gas test was conducted in an upper array filter (FU 910). The response at the time of gas peak pressure was subtly dissimilar to that seen at FL 903 with two peak pressures. Lasgit has confirmed the coupling between gas, stress and pore-water pressure for flow before and after major gas entry at the field scale. All observations suggest mechanisms of pathway propagation and dilatancy predominate. In all three gas tests the propagation was through localised features and the general movement direction was towards the bottom of the deposition hole {{in the direction of the}} prevailing stress gradient. The injection tests have shown that the interface between barriers is a key part of the system. Gas appears to have exited the deposition hole in Gas test 2, but failed to find a way out during Gas test 3; where gas continued to migrate along the canister/buffer interface. Throughout the history of Lasgit parts of the system have been artificially and naturally hydrated. Hydraulic results, from controlled and uncontrolled events, show that the buffer continues to mature and has yet to reach full maturation. Hydration of the clay is progressing well but sections of bentonite remain in suction and in hydraulic disequilibrium...|$|R
