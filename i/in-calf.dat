40|$|Although {{the effect}} of animal and diet factors on enteric methane (CH 4) {{emissions}} from confined cattle has been extensively examined, less data is available regarding CH 4 emissions from grazing young cattle. A study was undertaken to evaluate {{the effect of}} the physiological state of Holstein-Friesian heifers on their enteric CH 4 emissions while grazing a perennial ryegrass sward. Two experiments were conducted: Experiment 1 ran from May 2011 for 11 weeks and Experiment 2 ran from August 2011 for 10 weeks. In each experiment, Holstein-Friesian heifers were divided into three treatment groups (12 animals/group) consisting of calves, yearling heifers, and <b>in-calf</b> heifers (average ages: 8. 5, 14. 5, and 20. 5 months, respectively). Methane emissions were estimated for each animal in the final week of each experiment using the sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique. Dry matter (DM) intake was estimated using the calculated metabolizable energy (ME) requirement divided by the ME concentration in the grazed grass. As expected, live weight increased with increasing animal age (P < 0. 001); however, {{there was no difference in}} live weight gain among the three groups in Experiment 1, although in Experiment 2, this variable decreased with increasing animal age (P < 0. 001). In Experiment 1, yearling heifers had the highest CH 4 emissions (g·d− 1) and <b>in-calf</b> heifers produced more than calves (P < 0. 001). When expressed as CH 4 emissions per unit of live weight, DM intake, and gross energy (GE) intake, yearling heifers had higher emission rates than calves and <b>in-calf</b> heifers (P < 0. 001). However, the effects on CH 4 emissions were different in Experiment 2, in which CH 4 emissions (g·d− 1) increased linearly with increasing animal age (P < 0. 001), although the difference between yearling and <b>in-calf</b> heifers was not significant. The CH 4 /live weight ratio was lower in <b>in-calf</b> heifers than in the other two groups (P < 0. 001), while CH 4 energy output as a proportion of GE intake was lower in calves than in yearling and <b>in-calf</b> heifers (P < 0. 05). All data were then pooled and used to develop prediction equations for CH 4 emissions. All relationships are significant (P < 0. 001), with R 2 values ranging from 0. 630 to 0. 682. These models indicate that CH 4 emissions could be increased by 0. 252  g·d− 1 with an increase of 1  kg live weight or by 14. 9  g·d− 1 with an increase of 1  kg·d− 1 of DM intake; or, the CH 4 energy output could be increased by 0. 046  MJ·d− 1 with an increase of 1  MJ·d− 1 of GE intake. These results provide an alternative approach for estimating CH 4 emissions from grazing dairy heifers when actual CH 4 emission data are not available...|$|E

40|$|Cows dairy {{reproduction}} and its level of efficiency are main topics of interest of our breeders. Constant downward trend of important reproduction indicators, often reaching critical values, is becoming main problem of many agricultural plants aligned to beef-raising. The higher attention to beef-raising is needed {{especially in the}} foothill areas and in regions with harder conditions (LFA areas). Beef-raising is not aimed to fulfil only a production, it also stands for unsubstituable reproduction functions. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate reproduction indicators in three different breedings in the five year range 2002 - 2006 (such as insemination interval, intersemination interval, servis cycle, insemination index, parturition interval and pregnancy percentage after first insemination) on the chosen dairycows. According the level the individual breedings were compared (Rychnov nad Malsi, Vlci Jamy, Tesov) testing the CESTR runt. In Rychnov nad Malsi, where the runt CESTR and HOLSTYN are breeded, the differences between these runts reproduction indicators were evaluated. The level of milk efficiency, the methods of beef-raising, month of calving and order of lactation were taken into account. The length of SP is unsatisfactory in all breedings. The average SP in the whole period under observation were in Rychnov nad Malsi 125, 2 days (CESTR), in Vlci Jamy 123, 5 days and in Tesov 125, 7 days.

40|$|The general aim of {{the present}} work was to compare dairy {{performance}} and some reproductive parameters of Holstein-Friesian (HF) cows imported from Sweden as an <b>in-calf</b> heifers, and their age mates in Poland. The animals were kept freely on the deep litter on the farm owned by Agro-company “Witkowo” and feeding was based on TMR (total mixed ration) system during whole year. All ration’s ingredients (bulky feed, concentrate, miscellaneous additives) were mixed and fed as all-mash. The feed ration depended from the physiological condition of a cow and it was composed of corn and grass ensilage, mash concentrate, crushed corn meal, brewer’s grains and beet pulp. Cows imported from Sweden as <b>in-calf</b> heifers obtained higher milk, fat and protein yield in both lactations comparing to home cows. Significant statistical differences were observed for kg of milk, kg of protein, for FCM (P< 0. 01) and for kg of fat (P< 0. 05) in 2 nd lactation. Fat and protein content in milk was in average higher for home cows (P< 0. 01). Big differences (P< 0. 01) were observed in SBT (proportion of protein to fat content) and RTB (difference between concentration of fat and protein) at imported cows in 2 nd lactation.

Cows with low milk protein percent had a different calving pattern from those with higher milk protein percent. Whereas 92. 5 % of cows in the high milk protein quartile had calved at least 3 weeks at mating start date, only 84. 3 % in the low milk protein quartile had calved by the same date. The mean 3 -week submission rate and 6 -week <b>in-calf</b> rate were lower (P 0. 05) between quartile of milk protein percent.

40|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} that the productivity of New Zealand beef herds has improved over time. Data from the NZ Meat and Wool Board’s Economic Service (2006) suggest that the average national calving percentage has declined over the last two decades. During the same period cattle carcass weights have increased but so too has the average cow live-weight which has resulted in increased maintenance costs of the cow herds. It is unclear whether production efficiency in the industry has improved or declined over time. The aim of this research was to develop means of improving productivity in commercial beef herds through practical methods of performance recording. The objectives were firstly to establish current management practices in commercial herds and secondly to develop an objective system for cow selection and culling which would have practical application in commercial herds. 	 Beef management survey Ninety two commercial beef producers with more than 100 breeding cows from the greater Canterbury region of New Zealand were surveyed. Pasture control was the main reason given for owning a beef herd. Size and conformation were the main selection criteria for choosing replacement heifers and bulls. Over 80 % of herds retained their own heifers as replacements and > 60 % mated yearling heifers to first calve at two years of age. Fertility was poor in the surveyed herds. <b>In-calf</b> rates at pregnancy testing averaged 88 % for maiden heifers, 92 % for rising second calvers and 93 % for mixed age (m. a.) cows.

Reproductive management of dairy herds in New Zealand: Attitudes, priorities and constraints perceived by farmers managing seasonal-calving, pasture-based herds in four regions. New Zealand Veterinary Journal, 59 (1), 28 - 39. doi: 10. 1080 / 00480169. 2011. 547167 Dairy herd reproductive performance is purportedly in decline in New Zealand and internationally. The aetiology is multifactorial and complex {{and a broad}} range of hypotheses for this decline have been proposed, including cow and herd factors. An effective dairy industry needs optimal reproductive performance to maintain cattle welfare and a competitive advantage in the international marketplace. Six key herd-level management factors were identified as being associated with the reproductive performance in Australian seasonal-calving pasture-based dairy herds. A reproductive extension programme was built around these findings designed to enable farmers to improve reproductive performance on farm (InCalf). In 2008, the New Zealand dairy industry adapted InCalf for New Zealand conditions and made it available to dairy farmers and rural professionals. Coinciding with this programme development, the New Zealand dairy industry also set a national target of a herd-level average of 78 % of cows pregnant by day 42 of the seasonal breeding period (6 week <b>in-calf</b> rate) by 2016. The last benchmarking of reproductive performance in the New Zealand dairy herd was undertaken in 1999 - 2000 and the first aim of this thesis was to estimate the current national-level for reproductive performance. Secondly, the effectiveness of farmer participation in the InCalf extension programme was quantified using a randomised controlled study. This study found a 67 % mean 6 week <b>in-calf</b> rate over both 2009 / 10 and 2010 / 11 study years amongst those herds allocated to a control group, reflecting similar findings to the previous benchmarking study. Although this finding suggests that overall reproductive performance has remained similar over the decade, conception to first mating (first service conception rate) has declined by 5 % to 48 % while the rate of breeding in the first 21 days of mating (3 week submission rate) has remained similar at 81 % suggesting that the submission rate in the second 21 days of breeding has improved to account for the decline in first service conception rate. Change in behaviour in key management factors is needed in order to improve 6 week <b>in-calf</b> rate. Baseline interviews with farmers found general satisfaction with reproductive performance. This is a potential barrier to improvement, since dissatisfaction is needed to create the tension for change hypothesised to drive behavioural change. This randomised controlled study found that farmer participation in regional InCalf extension programmes resulted in an average 2 % improvement in reproductive performance during the year of the intervention over herds where farmers did not participate (p = 0. 05). The greatest effect was seen in the lowest performing herds and these should become the focus of future extension. Herds participating in the InCalf extension programme had a significant improvement in heifer live-weight, premating mean body condition score and oestrus detection over herds that did not participate (p < 0. 05). No significant difference was found in the distribution of calvings, anoestrous cow management or bull management. Improvements in the InCalf programme to achieve behaviour change for those management factors where the current InCalf has not proved effective may lift performance and further work is needed to evaluate the extent of the effect of participation on attitude change. The industry must now decide if this is sufficient improvement in reproductive performance to invest further in this model of extension and whether to improve it using the recommendations from this thesis...|$|E
30|$|The {{recurrence}} of spontaneous abortion by pregnant heifers within 3  weeks of {{arrival at the}} feedlots has been noted by some farmers as a rationale for presenting their pregnant heifers for slaughter. The disruptive bulling behaviour being recognised was implicated by other farmers for slaughtering pregnant cows by Gregory and Grandlin (2007). The occurrence of bulling amounting to 11 % during the peak period in autumn and winter has always left the victimized <b>in-calf</b> cows ill {{as a result of}} unwanted mounting by the buller steers. The exhibition of buller syndrome by the bulling steers usually influences some cattle farmers in the USA to cull their injured pregnant cows. The depressions in the beef market in the United State of America have sometimes compelled farmers as well to offer 1 – 3 % of their pregnant heifers for slaughter and retain fewer heifers on their farms as breeding replacements (Gregory and Grandin 2007). It was reported that a total of 28.29 % of cows in their third trimester of pregnancy were culled because of infertility, 21.8 % for mastitis and 15.8 % as a result of old age (Singleton 1996; Ernst 2009).|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} breeding index (EBI) {{was launched}} in November 2000 as the selection tool for {{the realization of the}} Irish dairy breeding objective.

The economic values applied in 2001 were derived using the ‘Moorepark Dairy Systems Model ’ (Shalloo et al., 2004) using costs and prices that were current at the time.

The heifer rearing scheme included free advice on calf rearing, drugs, acaricides, minerals and subsidised concentrates for 30 months. The farmers in the coconut growing area integrate dairying with their plantation, they sell their milk to the main processors.

40|$|Many {{automated}} {{systems for}} detecting ovulating cows in dairy herds require decisions when designing algorithms and selecting cutpoints {{that require a}} compromise between diagnostic sensitivity (probability of classifying an ovulating cow as ovulating) and diagnostic specificity [daily probability of not classifying a non-ovulating cow (whether open or pregnant but not yet diagnosed as pregnant) as ovulating]. Because sensitivity must be moderately high, this compromise often results in specificity below 100 %. However, little is understood {{about the effects of}} reduced specificity on herd reproductive performance. A stochastic model was developed that simulates the reproductive process in a year-round calving dairy herd to assess effects of changes in specificity at various combinations of sensitivity and conception rate (proportion of inseminations resulting in pregnancy) on herd reproductive measures of economic importance. The model included effects of inseminations in pregnant cows on probability of conceptus loss, and variation in the interval from conceptus loss to next ovulation (i. e. the next opportunity to reconceive). Using moderate assumptions of the probability of conceptus loss following insemination in pregnant cows, reductions in specificity from 99. 9 to 99. 5, 99, 98 and 97 %, resulted in decreases in mean 100 day <b>in-calf</b> rate (100 DICR; the proportion of cows with a positive pregnancy diagnosis to an insemination on or before 100 days since calving) of 1. 2, 3. 3, 6. 8 and 9. 7 percentage points, respectively. These same reductions in Sp resulted in increases in mean 200 day not <b>in-calf</b> rate (200 DNICR; the proportion of cows with negative pregnancy diagnosis results to all inseminations on or before 200 days since calving) of 0. 5, 1. 6, 3. 6 and 6 percentage points, and increases in mean number of inseminations per calving (Insems/Calving; the total number of inseminations in the herd divided by the number of cows that recalved) by factors of 1. 2, 1. 5, 2. 1 and 2. 8, respectively. The relationship between specificity for detecting ovulating cows and the 100 DICR, 200 DNICR and Insems/Calving was sensitive to changes in the probability of conceptus loss following inseminations in pregnant cows. However, even with conservative assumptions, specificity still had important effects on 100 DICR and 200 DNICR. Varying parameters for the interval from conceptus loss to next ovulation had little effect on the relationships between specificity and these measures. These results demonstrate that specificity is an important consideration when designing algorithms and selecting cutpoints in automated systems for detecting ovulating cows. Low specificity not only increases Insems/Calving but also prolongs intervals from calving to the establishment of a sustained pregnancy resulting in substantial reductions in 100 DICR and increases in 200 DNICR. This model could assist when determining economically optimal combinations of ovulation detection sensitivity and specificity when developing automated systems for selecting ovulating cows in commercial herds. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Recommendations for oestrus {{synchronisation}} of dairy heifers using progesterone-containing intravaginal devices suggest re-insertion of used devices 16 days after first insemination {{for a period}} of 5 days to allow a second opportunity for artificial insemination. Controlled studies on the effectiveness of re-using intravaginal devices to synchronise returns to oestrus in non-pregnant dairy heifers are lacking. A clinical trial was conducted involving 750 Friesian heifers in 13 herds. After an initial synchronisation programme, the used intravaginal devices were re-inserted 14 or 16 days after first insemination into half of the heifers in each herd {{for a period of}} 5 days. After the first synchronisation programme, 47. 5 % of heifers remained non-pregnant. Re-insertion of used intravaginal devices for 5 days significantly increased the number of non-pregnant heifers detected in oestrus and inseminated by 48 hours after device removal compared to heifers in which devices were not re-inserted (45. 2 % v. 27. 3 %, p < 0. 05, in herds where intravaginal devices were re-inserted on day 14; 48. 8 % v. 13. 6 %, p < 0. 05, in herds where intravaginal devices were re-inserted on day 16). Re-insertion at 14 or 16 days after first insemination was equally effective in increasing visible returns to service. However, the number of non-pregnant heifers synchronised for a second round of artificial insemination was less than expected. Conception rate to the re-synchronised oestrus was unaffected by the treatment. It is concluded that the additional procedures of CIDR re-insertion, removal, tailpainting and insemination involved in there-synchrony programme, and the relatively low <b>in-calf</b> rate to the re-synchronised round of insemination, reduced the potential benefits of re-synchronisation.

Methods Serum samples, collected from cows and youngstock from 103 dairy cattle herds, were analyzed for antibodies against BHV- 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), and Mycoplasma bovis. A questionnaire was used to collect data concerning herd management factors and reproductive performance, as well as the occurrence of clinical signs of respiratory disease in the last two years, as evaluated by the veterinarian or farm manager. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and logistic regression analysis were performed to identify and quantify the risk factors. Results A low to moderate prevalence (1 - 49 %) of BRSV antibodies among youngstock was associated with a high occurrence of respiratory disease (OR = 6. 2, p = 0. 010) in cows and <b>in-calf</b> heifers. Employees of the farm may participate in the spread of such disease. Larger herd size, loose-housing of cows, housing youngstock separately from cows until pregnancy, and purchasing new animals were factors possibly related to a high occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms in pregnant heifers and cows. The highest risk of abortions (> 1. 3 %) and increased insemination index (number of inseminations per pregnancy) (> 1. 9) occurred in herds with a moderate prevalence of BHV- 1 antibodies (1 - 49 %) in cows. Conclusions BHV- 1 was not associated with acute respiratory disease in adult dairy cattle, however was significantly related to reproductive performance. BRSV possesses the main role in respiratory disease complex in adult dairy cattle. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUrine patches {{deposited}} by grazing cattle represent ‘hot-spots’ of {{very high}} nitrogen (N) loading from which environmentally important losses of N may occur (ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions, nitrate leaching). Information on the quantities of N deposited to grazed pastures as urine, the spatial and temporal distribution of urine patches and how these {{may be influenced by}} pasture management practices is limited. The objectives of this study were to assess the potential of recently developed urine sensors for providing data on urination behaviour by grazing cattle and relate this to measurements of ammonia emissions from the grazed paddocks. A total of six trials were conducted across two sites; two on a 1 ha paddock at Easter Bush near Edinburgh using beef cattle (c. 630 kg live weight) and four on a 0. 5 ha paddock at North Wyke in Devon using <b>in-calf</b> dairy heifers (c. 450 kg live weight). Laboratory calibrations were conducted to provide sensor-specific functions for urine volume and N concentration. The quantity and quality of data from the urine sensors improved with successive trials through modifications to the method of attachment to the cow. The number of urination events per animal per day was greater for the dairy heifers, with a mean value of 11. 6 (se 0. 70) compared with 7. 6 (se 0. 76) for the beef cattle. Volume per urination event (mean 1. 8, range 0. 4 – 6. 4 L) and urine N concentration (range 0. 6 – 31. 5 gL− 1, excluding outliers) were similar for the two groups of cattle. Ammonia emission measurements were unsuccessful in most of the trials. The urine sensors have potential to provide useful information on urine N deposition by grazing cattle but suggested improvements including making the sensors lighter, designing a better method of attachment to the cow and including a more reliable location sensor...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate reproductive performance of Ethiopian Boran cows at Abernosa ranch in the production of Boron x Holstein-Friesian Ft crossbred dairy heifers for distribution to smallholder farmers. Performance data from the ranch between 1993 and 2001 was used for this study. The results show delayed age at first conception (53. 9 months) and long'calving interval (534. 3 days), with average breeding efficiency of 44. 6 %, average calving rate of 72 % and heifer production efficiency of only 38 %. The pre and post weaning calf mortality rates were 17. 3 and 2. 9 %, respectively. These led to a very low average cost recovery on in calf heifer production of only 14. 6 %. Based on the average herd productivity parameters determined in this study, it was calculated that this rate of cost recovery could be improved three fold to 42. 8 % by introducing such realistic management interventions as replacement of old and unproductive cows with average performing ones, enforcing a clearly defined breeding practice, managing open cows and heifers separately for better beat detection, supplementary feeding and timely mating, and full utilization of the available resources for the key output of the ranch - <b>in-calf</b> crossbred heifers. Furthermore, between 1994 and 2000, annually on average 20 % of the crossbred heifers were culled for health difficulties, physical injury and unknown reasons. If this rather high culling rate could be reduced by half through separate and proper management of heifers, the number of available heifers for mating could be increased by 15. 4 %, and with this, also the number of in calf heifers available for distribution. Overall, it was noted that the production of in calf crossbred heifers in the ranch has been very inefficient. It was therefore recommended that alternative ways of producing crossbred heifers such as contract production with smallholder farmers or commercial farmers and direct production of crossbred heifers in the hands of smallholder farmers who own suitable indigenous cows should be considered for more economical production of crossbred heifers...|$|E
40|$|Blood {{and milk}} {{parameters}} other than ketones {{have been used}} extensively to monitor the risk of negative energy balance (NEB) and reproductive inefficiency in dairy cows. However, few such {{studies have been conducted}} in New Zealand. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the benefits of using milk parameters as a monitoring tool in addition to blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) to better predict risk of submission within three weeks of planned start of mating (PSM). A prospective study was conducted in 135 dairy cows from five different pasture-fed, spring-calving commercial dairy farms in Manawatu district of New Zealand from July to November, 2014. Blood samples were analyzed for NEFA and BHB, both pre-calving (up to 2 weeks before expected calving date) and post-calving (2 weeks after calving). Fat, protein, lactose, BHB, and urea concentrations were measured in milk samples taken 2 weeks post-calving, repeating approximately at 4 week intervals until 6 weeks after PSM. The reproductive outcome variable tested was whether or not the cows were inseminated in the first 3 weeks of PSM. NEB was seen in 57 / 135 cows pre-calving (based on blood NEFA [BN 1] ≥ 0. 4 mmol/L) and 47 / 135 cows post-calving (based on blood BHB [BB 2] ≥ 1. 2 mmol/L) giving 95 % confidence interval, while 21. 5 % of the cows showed negative reproductive outcome. Strong correlations between milk components values meant that of the 20 milk component tests, data from only 10 were included in the logistic regression. Milk BHB sampled in the second month after calving (B 2) was the only near significant variable in the final logistic regression model (p = 0. 061) with the mean values for cows submitted in the first 3 weeks of the breeding season being 0. 05 mmol/L, and for cows which were not submitted 0. 09 mmol/L. Overall, this study could not provide any evidence on advantage of adding milk parameters to blood information in improving the accuracy in predicting 3 -week submission rate. However, the relatively low power of this study and limited negative outcomes suggest this need to be confirmed by taking more animals and choosing other reproductive outcome such as 3 -week or 6 -week <b>in-calf</b> rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine time budgets, blood urea content, total protein and body condition score as adaptive responses to seasonal dynamics by breeding Nguni cows and heifers reared on a sweetveld. Twenty four clinically healthy Nguni cows and heifers were selected for the study. The animals were grouped according to their parities namely: Parity 1 (n= 5), Parity 2 (n= 5), Parity 3 - 6 (old cows) (n= 9) and <b>in-calf</b> heifers (n= 5). Two separate experiments were conducted and running concurrently. In the first experiment time budgets (time spent walking, grazing, lying down, drinking water and browsing) of the cows and heifers were monitored for two consecutive days once a month, while in the second experiment blood samples were collected from the coccygeal vein once a month during weighing. Body condition scores were also determined during weighing times. Heifers maintained significantly (p 0. 05) of both blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (7. 5 ± 0. 39 mmol/l) and TP (80. 7 ± 1. 19 g/l) in November. All the animals had the least BUN levels in January (1. 93 ± 0. 18 mmol/l) while the highest total protein (TP) (82. 1 ± 1. 08 g/l) was recorded in February. All the animals showed distinct (p 0. 05) in most behavioural attributes in the cool-wet season. Heifers spent significantly (p 0. 05) body condition scores, amount of time spent browsing and drinking water. On the other hand, heifers (14. 7 ± 1. 50 %) and first parity cows (13. 9 ± 1. 50 %) traded-off most (p< 0, 05) of their time walking during the cool-dry season. Similarly heifers spent more time browsing (6. 4 ± 0. 62 %) forage plants (p< 0. 05) than all the cows during the cool-wet season. Grazing (r = 0. 17) and standing (r = - 0. 18) were correlated (p< 0. 05) with all the behavioural attributes measured in this environment. It was concluded that seasonal dynamics in trade-off behaviour through time budgeting, maintenance of BUN and TP were necessary for the Nguni cows and heifers to maintain their body condition scores within a narrow range throughout the four seasons...|$|E
40|$|In the seasonal, pastoral-based dairy {{system of}} New Zealand, it is {{important}} for herds to achieve consistently high reproductive performance. A large amount of research has been conducted into the adverse effects of high temperatures on the fertility of dairy cows. However, similar studies quantifying the effects of cold conditions in grazing systems have not been carried out. In New Zealand, farmers regularly blame the weather for low submission rates and conception to artificial insemination. This is because cows that appear to be cycling well, prior to the planned start of mating (PSM), then appear to stop cycling during the mating season, commonly in conjunction with adverse weather conditions, such as exposure to short or extended periods of cold, wet and windy conditions. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of cold, wet and windy conditions on the reproductive performance of dairy cows, in order to support or refute this farmer perception. Calving, mating, lactation and pedigree records were provided by CRV Ambreed for the 2013 season, as well as calving records for the 2014 calving period, for 6664 cows from 20 herds throughout New Zealand. Climatic variables for the same time period were obtained from NIWA and used to calculate a cold stress index, which was analysed against the reproductive performance of each herd. The mean 21 -day submission rate (SR 21) of all 6664 cows was 77 % and the mean 21 -day <b>in-calf</b> rate (21 d-ICR) was 45 %. The average cold stress index (CSI) during the mating period was 967. 4 kJm- 2 h- 1. The results from this study showed that there was a linear and quadratic effect of CSI on both SR 21 and 21 d-ICR, with an increase as the conditions began to cool, followed by a decrease in both submission and conception rates as the CSI reach levels above 1000 kJm- 2 h- 1. This pattern may indicate a survival mechanism which allows the cows to produce more heat, but once CSI levels reach around 1000 kJm- 2 h- 1, cows are no longer able to maintain body temperature and sustain production, and fertility suffers. Further investigations should focus on the specific threshold level for the decline of SR 21 and 21 d-ICR, as well as the length of exposure and mechanisms which cause the decline in submission rates and conception rates...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the establishment and}} Development of the first indigenous cattle breed improvement endeavors in Ethiopia at the Adami Tulu and Abernossa Cattle Multiplication and Improvement Center, in the Rift Valley. It is intended to analyse and document {{the activities of the}} center and use the experiences of the center over the last three decades as a springboard for future livestock breed improvement efforts in the country. The center commenced its activities in October 1960 with an establishment herd of 351 Borana cows and 12 Borana bulls purchased from Borana and Arrero Awrajas of the then Sidamo Administration Region in southern Ethiopia. The Adami Tulu part of the ranch was the first to be established on an area of 1534 ha. The Abernossa ranch, located about 12 km south west of Adami Tulu ranch, was established in 1962 on an area of : 1240 ha. The major objective of this activity was to improve the Borana cattle and also to introduce modern cattle breeding and production system in the country. Activities were expanded to include a crossbreeding programme with Holstein Friesian cattle to produce <b>in-calf</b> crossbred heifers for distribution to farmers interested in dairy Development. Subsequently, the Borana selection and improvement programme was re-located at the Didi Tura ranch in Borana country and the center was restructured to focus on crossbred heifer production only. In its 35 years of existence, the center's activities have gone through a number of expansion and contraction, and accordingly genetic progress and retrogress in the breed improvement efforts. A major destruction and damage occurred on the ranch in 1991 when there was a change in government. Infrastructure was destroyed, records were burnt and animals were either slaughtered or looted. Subsequently, about half of the land area was given back to the local community by popular demand and the ranch was confined to the eastern part with approximately 2, 000 ha. New stock (heifers) was purchased from the Borana country and restocking and improvement activities recommenced. Currently, the ranch manages about 2, 000 heads of breeder cows and still produces crossbred heifers. Over the years, the ranch had made significant genetic improvement on the Borana cattle through performance evaluation and selection. However, the attempt to undertake such farfetched and long-term programme has been repeatedly hampered by the local community demanding their land rights. A participatory genetic improvement programmes that benefit local communities and the nation coupled with appropriate education and awareness creation in the community should have been designed to ensure full participation and support by the community for such long-term genetic improvement programmes...|$|E
40|$|Visual {{detection}} of standing oestrus {{has been the}} traditional method of selecting cows for AI. However, over time, the display of oestrous behaviour has decreased and labour costs and herd sizes have increased, making visual {{detection of}} oestrous behaviour less practical. Thus demand for new and automated systems for selecting cows for AI has increased world-wide. This thesis aims to improve the current knowledge of systems for selecting cattle for AI and their performance under conditions typical in the Australian production environment and identify requirements and opportunities for future systems. Many proposed automated systems for detecting ovulating cows suffer from {{a high proportion of}} false positive indications. However, {{little is known about the}} effects of inseminations following a false positive attention on primary measures of reproductive performance. A stochastic model was developed that simulates the reproductive process in a year-round calving dairy herd to assess effects of changes in specificity at various combinations of sensitivity and conception rate on herd reproductive measures of economic importance. The model is to the best of my knowledge the first computer model of herd reproductive performance to include specificity for detecting ovulating cows as a variable input and include a risk of conceptus loss following artificial inseminations in pregnant cows, and a distribution for the interval from a conceptus loss to next ovulation. The simulations showed that reductions in specificity for detecting ovulating cows not only increased the number of inseminations per calving but also prolonged the intervals from calving to establishment of a sustained pregnancy. This was seen as decreases in the 100 day <b>in-calf</b> rate (the proportion of cows with a positive pregnancy diagnosis to an insemination on or before 100 days since calving), and increases in the 200 day not <b>in-calf</b> rate (the proportion of cows with negative pregnancy diagnosis results to all inseminations on or before 200 days since calving – cows with a high chance of being culled for reproductive failure). Thus specificity of ovulation detection should be an important consideration when designing algorithms and selecting cutpoints in automated systems for detecting ovulating cows. In addition the model developed could be useful when determining optimal combinations of ovulation detection sensitivity and specificity when developing automated systems for selecting cows for AI. A controlled trial was conducted to determine whether a single measurement of vaginal electrical resistance using a commercially available probe (Ovatec® probe), can discriminate between dioestrus and oestrus in a group of beef heifers which had been treated to synchronise oestrus. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting oestrus heifers was determined at different diagnostic cutpoints. Single measurements of vaginal electrical resistance using the Ovatec® probe were found to be highly discriminatory between oestrus and dioestrus and lower values of vaginal electrical resistance at the time of AI were associated with an increased chance of conception when oestrus status was unknown. In a subsequent study the temporal changes in vaginal electrical resistance relative to time of ovulation using the same probe was determined in dairy cattle. The mean vaginal electrical resistance of all cows studied varied with time from ovulation but no conclusion was able to be made regarding the ability to predict time of ovulation in individual animals. A prospective observational study was conducted to evaluate and compare the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of a neck mounted 2 -hourly activity meter system for detecting ovulating cows using 5 different activity alert algorithms in two paddock-based dairy herds with different animal environments and breeding systems. Concurrently, a second prospective observational study was conducted to assess the distribution of intervals from onset and end of increased activity to time of ovulation in a paddock-based pasture-fed dairy herd. The studies showed that monitoring cow activity with neck-mounted 2 -hourly activity meters in paddock-based dairy cows in two diverse management systems can detect a high proportion of cows about to ovulate and provide a good indication of when ovulation is likely to occur. However, the specificities and positive predictive values using the algorithms assessed may be lower than desirable. Finally, a prospective observational study was conducted to assess the potential for improving pregnancy rates to AI if the time of ovulation could be predicted with more certainty. The variations in AI to ovulation interval and the proportions of inseminations resulting in pregnancy for different AI to ovulation intervals were observed on two Australian commercial dairy farms with different reproductive management practices. There was substantial variation in the intervals from AI to ovulation within and between the two study herds and the AI to ovulation interval was associated with significant differences in pregnancy rate. In addition, the most frequent AI to ovulation interval observed in the study did not correspond to the interval with the highest observed pregnancy rate. Thus it is possible pregnancy rates may be improved with methods that allow better insemination timing relative to ovulation. In the same study cows on one of the farms were fitted with neck mounted 2 -hourly activity meters. The interval from onset of increased cow activity to time of AI was associated with pregnancy rates, suggesting that activity monitoring may be useful for identifying the optimal time to inseminate. This thesis demonstrates that inseminations after a false positive attention can have substantial negative effects on economically important measures of herd reproductive performance. It indicates that vaginal electrical resistance monitoring has the potential to be used for selecting cows for AI if this parameter can be monitored in a practical way and that 2 -hourly activity monitoring can detect a high proportion of ovulating cows and provide a useful indication of when ovulation will occur in paddock based dairy herds. This thesis also indicates that improving methods of selecting cows for AI to allow better insemination timing relative to ovulation could potentially increase pregnancy rates in some herds. Finally, this thesis provides a foundation on which to form subsequent studies to aid the development of improved systems for selecting cows for AI...|$|E
40|$|Data {{collected}} between 1977 and 1985 on reproductive {{and growth}} traits of Borana cattle and their crosses with Friesian, were analysed using the least-squares procedure. The animals were maintained for beef and <b>in-calf</b> dairy heifer {{production at the}} Abernossa Cattle Breeding and Improvement Ranch of the Ministry of Agriculture. The result of the analysis showed that {{the mean number of}} services per conception for first pregnancy was 1. 701. The difference among the breed groups was not significant but both year and season of conception had significant influence. Heifers, which conceived during the small rainy and dry seasons, required 0. 16 and 0. 21 more services, respectively, than those conceiving during the big rainy season. Age at first calving (AFC) averaged 31. 5, 32. 7, 45. 2 and 46. 8 months for F 1, 3 / 4 Friesian, Boran mated to Boran bulls and artificially inseminated Boran heifers, respectively. Year of birth had a significant effect on AFC of all mating groups except on that of artificially inseminated Boran heifers. Season of birth had significant effect on AFC of Fl heifers only. The mean values for calving interval (CI) were 465, 552, 525 and 437 days respectively for Boran cows mated to Boran bulls, Boran cows mated to Friesian bulls, Boran cows artificially inseminated and Fl cows artificially inseminated. Year of calving had a significant effect on CI of all cow mating groups but influence of season was significant on Boran cows mated to Boran bulls and Boran cows artificially inseminated only. Parity had signficant influence on CI of all Boran dams, but not on F 1 dams. The preweaning mortality rate was 4. 0 % and 2. 9 % for Borana and Fl cross calves, respectively. Parity of dam, sex of calf and the interaction between breed group of calf and year of birth were significant. The total mortality rate up to first calving age for pure Boran cattle was estimated to be 11. 5 %. Based on this a cow in Boran Breeding unit needed 2. 27 calvings to produce a heifer calf that could in turn calve in the herd. Thus, 37 percent of the females born were required as herd replacements, and the generation interval was 6. 6 years. Mean body weight of Boran, Fl and 3 / 4 Friesian cross calves was 25. 17 kg, 25. 39 kg and 25. 73 kg at birth and 157. 5 kg, 176. 7 kg and 179. 9 kg at weaning, respectively. All factors included in the analysis and their interaction had a significant effect on both parameters {{with the exception of the}} effect of season of birth and its interaction with breed group on birth weight. Weights of Boran calves at one-, two- and three-years of age were 179 kg, 269 kg and 338 kg, respectively. Sex and year of birth had significant effect on weights at these three stages. Season of birth had a significant effect on the two-year weight while the effect of parity of dam was significant on the one-year weight only. Estimated heritability values of 0. 32, 0. 24, 0. 43, 0. 29 and 0. 24 for birth, weaning, one-year, two-year and three-year weights of Boran cattle suggest that body weight increase of 0. 11. 1. 1, 2. 8, 3. 1 and 2. 4 kg per year could be achieved through selection at the respective ages. Cow productivity index of 127 kg and 122 kg of an eight-month old weaner calf per cow per year was estimated for Boran cows weaning Boran and F 1 calves, respectively. Cow productivity of all cows was significantly influenced by year of calving and parity of dam. Boran cows producing F 1 calves were more productive when calving during the small rainy season than those calving during the other seasons...|$|E
40|$|An {{expert system}} for {{investigating}} the reproductive performance of seasonally calving dairy herds (DairyFIX) {{was designed and}} developed. The system uses information retrieved from an on-farm information system (DairyMAN) to identify the primary causes of reduced performance and make recommendations for further action. The current performance of DairyMAN user herds and a sample of herds from the National Dairy Database were initially measured. Realistic targets for each performance indicator were then calculated using this information. The associations and interactions between the performance and diagnostic indicators used in DairyMAN were more clearly defined using multivariate statistical analyses and path models. Additional information {{was obtained from the}} literature for incorporation into the DairyFIX system. The reproductive performance studies covered one complete year (1993 / 94 season) and were limited to spring calving seasonal herds which are typical of the New Zealand dairy industry. Such herds are managed so that all cows calve on a synchronous annual cycle {{as close as possible to}} the "ideal" calving date in that location. A typical aim is to have calvings spread over 6 to 8 weeks with a narrow spread being strongly favoured. The herd planned start of calving (PSC) date defines the beginning of this optimal period of calving and the planned start of mating (PSM) the first day of mating that must be used to achieve the desired calving pattern. Expert system development is introduced in Chapter 1 with some historical information that supports the use of on-farm information systems. The concepts and design methods used for developing expert systems are then reviewed in brief. Examples are provided to illustrate the different levels of sophistication that can be used for developing expert systems. These demonstrate that relatively simple designs are often the most successful. Examples including Bovid and Dairy Expert are discussed in detail. The methods used to monitor seasonally calving dairy herds are then reviewed with an emphasis on the main performance and diagnostic indicators used in DairyMAN. These include the four and eight week calving rates, 21 day submission rates, non-return and conceptions rates and four and eight week <b>in-calf</b> rates. Empty rates can be considered the final definitive measure of performance by many dairy farmers, but the difficulties with interpreting this figure are presented. The limited mating period in seasonally calving dairy herds means that the assessment of heat detection is difficult and often inaccurate. For this reason several alternative methods for assessing heat detection efficiency and accuracy are discussed in detail. A detailed description is given in Chapter 2 of herd and individual cow performance for DairyMAN user herds and the National Dairy Database sample. These data show that the reproductive performance of New Zealand herds is often below that previously reported. Calving rates are on average above industry targets, but only with a significant level of calving induction. Removal of inductions for welfare and marketing reasons will have a significant effect on the performance of many herds. Submission rates are the earliest available measures of performance during a mating season. New Zealand herds do not, on average, achieve the necessary targets. All measures of heat detection efficiency, although imprecise, show this is not a major problem with about 6 % of heats missed. This has a negative effect on submission rates. Detection efficiency is an important issue for some individual herds as the consequences of poor heat detection are dramatic. The performance levels suggest that nutritional anoestrus and the effects of a spread calving pattern are the major causes of low submission rates. Conception rates of less than 60 % are reported. These are below those often suggested as typical for New Zealand herds. Much of the previous data has been taken from small study groups that may not adequately represent all herds. The common use of non-return rates may have created expectations that cannot be achieved in average herds as these are an optimistic measure of performance. Health events such as lameness are only reported for reference. Only limited health data is recorded although DairyMAN provides the flexibility to records such data. The variability in the type and degree of recording of these data is identified as a significant problem that limits the use of the available records. Some of the health events and especially lameness may have a large effect on the reproductive performance of many herds. Path models are developed in chapter 3 as an essential prerequisite to the development of the DairyFIX expert system. The models statistically confirm most of the relationships that have been previously considered important when evaluating herd reproductive performance. A number of factors including herd size and breed are shown to be associated with differing calving rates. The four week calving rate is shown to have strong indirect effects on submission rates, conception rates and herd <b>in-calf</b> rates. As such, it is one of the most important variables in seasonal herds. The importance of submission rates and conception rates is confirmed. Daily per cow milk production is shown to be a useful indicator of submission rates as both of these variables are directly influenced by nutrition. The models identify some limitations with using non-return rates as measures of conception. These generally give optimistic results that do not accurately reflect true performance. Such problems are compounded if reasonably accurate measures of heat detection cannot be obtained in herds with a very restricted mating period. Although the interactions between the performance and diagnostic indicators are largely understood from previous work this is the first time they have been brought together in statistically verified path models. The use of an on-farm information system (DairyMAN) was shown to be associated with improved herd performance including daily per cow milk yield and reproductive outcomes. DairyMAN user herds had cows of the same breed and genetic capacity. So DairyMAN users were able to produce more milk with animals of equivalent genetic merit, indicating that users achieved better management of the herd through improved attention to managerial details. This was associated with their adoption of DairyMAN, but not shown by this study to be a direct consequence of it. These findings are important because there is very little information confirming that on-farm information systems or central databases give true performance gains. This is despite the historical recognition of these systems and the rapid expansion in recent years. Justifying the use of more sophisticated tools such as an expert system would be more difficult if gains were not being achieved with the current technology. Calving induction was shown to be associated with some negative effects on milk yield and reproductive outcome. The New Zealand dairy industry does not currently favour the use of this management tool, but the impact any changes in management practices would have need to be evaluated with consideration of these effects. Calving induction is typically not used as recommended in New Zealand as many of the treatments are done too late to provide sufficient economic gains through increased lactation length and increasing the number of days from calving to the planned start of mating. Regional differences in performance were identified. DairyMAN user herds in the Manawatu had inferior conception rates while herds in the Taranaki had superior reproductive performance. These observed differences suggest a need to further identify causes of these differences, if performance is to be improved in some regions. The performance of individual cows and groups was examined in detail and statistical models developed for use in DairyFIX. Breed, lactation number, days calved at the start of mating and some health events were all shown to have an important impact on performance. The inferior performance of lactation 1 and 2 groups is having a large effect on performance. Cows in lactation 3 and 4 generally have the best performance with some reduction for aged cows. These aged cows do not dramatically affect overall herd performance because they are only a small proportion of most herds Jersey cows tended to show superior calving and submission rates. A number of complex models were developed for herds that pregnancy test and those that use non-return as the measure of conception. DairyFIX was developed to achieve two primary objectives. The first was to simplify the epidemiological approach to investigating herd reproductive problems. The system automates procedures that would otherwise be followed using DairyMAN and uses a graphical diagnostic interface to achieve this. DairyFIX quickly focuses on the important aspects of any performance deficit and reduces the time required to investigate a herd problem. Although DairyMAN is a comprehensive software package, users have difficulties due to its complexity and may invest a considerable amount of time exploring the program rather than focusing on the task required. The second objective of this project was to make expertise available for the user when examining herd performance. This required the use of the more sophisticated aspects of an expert system including the development of a "knowledge base" of information. DairyFIX consists of three sections. The first simply evaluates performance and determines if any problems exist. The second part considers the effect of the major components of performance such as the calving pattern and heat detection so that the primary causes of poor performance are identified. This section uses the statistical models previously developed to estimate expected performance. The third part of DairyFIX consists of several specific interrogation procedures for each area of poor performance. This section is not necessarily required for an operational system as the user can otherwise be referred to the appropriate reports in DairyMAN. Another module within DairyFIX was designed to assess the expected performance of a herd in subsequent seasons given a predicted herd profile. The models used for this purpose are similar to those that retrospectively evaluate performance. DairyFIX simplifies the investigative task and identifies the major causes of poor reproductive performance. It is anticipated that this tool will allow more dairy farmers and veterinarians to make effective use of DairyMAN while reducing the investment in time that is currently required...|$|E
