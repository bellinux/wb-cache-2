40|$|The present {{investigation}} reports the preparation and microstructural characterization of ultrafine CsCl crystallites using combined cryogenic and room temperature (RT) mechanical milling. The milling has been performed in evacuated WC vials under <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> <b>argon</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> The low temperature milling has been utilized {{as an effective}} means of rapid fracturing of the CsCl crystallites. This was followed by RT milling for different time durations. The final crystallite size obtained is 10 +/- 6 nm for sample cryo-milled for 11 h and subsequently RT milled for 35 h. The experimental findings indicate the strong effect of duration of cryo-milling on the final size of the crystallites. The prolonged room temperature milling leads to increase of the crystallite size due to deformation-induced sintering. The results have been discussed in the light of currently available literature.

All samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction, specific heat, and DC magnetization measurements. The crystals were also studied using the X-ray Laue technique and scanning electron microscopy. Increasing the Pr content for the Pr_ 2 +xZr_ 2 -xO_ 7 -x/ 2 powders enlarged the lattice parameter, and resulted in systematic changes in magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Stoichiometric and high quality single crystals of Pr_ 2 Zr_ 2 O_ 7 were grown using the optical floating zone technique under a <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> static <b>argon</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> to avoid inclusions of Pr^ 4 + and limit Pr vaporization. Increasing the growth speed was found to significantly reduce Pr vaporization for better control of stoichiometry. Scanning electron microscopy provided direct evidence of spinodal decomposition during growth that is controllable via rotation rate. An intermediate rotation rate of 3 - 6 rpm was found to produce the best microstructure. The magnetic susceptibility of crystals grown at rates from 1 - 20 mm/hr revealed changes that were consistent with Pr vaporization. Further, we report indications of local off-centering of Pr^ 3 + ions from the ideal pyrochlore sites, similar to what is known for the trivalent cation in Bi_ 2 Ti_ 2 O_ 7 and La_ 2 Zr_ 2 O_ 7.

The oxidation behaviors of the ball-milled LiH under different atmospheres are also studied and compared with those without ball milling. It is shown that no oxidation of LiH occurs under a high-purity argon atmosphere. However, oxidation of LiH takes place when the argon atmosphere contains some H 2 O and O 2 impurities. At temperatures higher than ∼ 55 °C, oxidation of LiH proceeds via the reaction of LiH + 1 / 4 O 2) 1 / 2 Li 2 O + 1 / 2 H 2, whereas at room temperature oxidation of LiH is likely caused by the simultaneous reactions of LiH + H 2 O) LiOH + H 2 and LiH + 1 / 2 O 2) LiOH. The oxidation behavior of LiH in ambient air with a 27 % relative humidity can be well described by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation. Furthermore, the ball-milled LiH oxidizes faster than the unmilled one, which is due to the finer particle size and larger surface area of the ball-milled powder. I...|$|E

The ceramic/metal systems together were preheated at about 600 C {{and then the}} temperatures were increased to the test maximum temperature, which exceeded 1800 C, in an <b>atmosphere</b> of <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> <b>argon.</b> Metal samples were placed onto ceramic substrates, and the system was heated to elevated temperatures past the melting point of the metallic specimen. After a short stay at the peak temperature, the system was cooled to room temperature and examined. The chemical changes across the interface and other microstructural developments were analyzed with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). This paper reports {{on the condition of}} the interfaces in the different systems studied and describes possible mechanisms influencing the microstructure...|$|R
40|$|Plasma-enhanced {{chemical}} vapor deposition {{has been}} used to synthesize diamond-like carbon (DLC) thin films. <b>High</b> <b>purity</b> <b>argon</b> and methane gases were used as precursors for the fabrication of the DLC films. The influence of plasma pretreatment on the growth of the DLC films has been studied by subjecting one of the substrates to plasma pretreatment prior to deposition of the DLC films, while maintaining the other substrate as the control. The structural properties of the DLC films have been characterized using atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The film grown on the pretreated substrate shows a more uniform coating as compared to the film grown on non-pretreated silicon substrate. The results are discussed based on diffusivity of carbon on silicon and the effect of the plasma pretreatment. Argon ion, AFM, diamond-like carbon, plasma pretreatment, Raman spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{fusion power}} is {{considered}} an ideal energy for the future due to abundant, green and safety. Wetting properties between the liquid metal and the structural materials in the liquid blanket of the fusion reactor related to the heat exchange efficiency and the irradiated plasma resistance, and {{directly related to the}} service life of the reactor structural materials. This article describes the wetting angle measurement experimental procedure of liquid lead-bismuth (PbBi) at reduced activation ferritic/martensitic steel (RAFM steel) surface based on the high-temperature static sessile drop method under the protection of <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> <b>argon,</b> including the images enhancement processing obtained by CCD camera, using ellipse fitting method to calculate the wetting angle, and were measured at 350 - 600 °C. The experimental results show that the wetting angles of liquid PbBi and RAFM steel are greater than 140 °, non-wetting...|$|R
40|$|The {{densification}} {{behavior of}} WC composites based on iron aluminide binder was investigated using laser scanning confocal mi¬croscopy (LSCM). Doped Fe 60 Al 40 alloys with boron levels ranging from 0 to 0. 1 wt% {{were used as}} the aluminide binders. The aluminide binders were prepared using controlled atmosphere ring grinding and then blended with WC powder. The composite powder compacted in an alumina crucible and held in a platinum holder in the confocal microscope. The temperature increased from ambient temperature up to 1500 °C under <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> <b>argon.</b> The presence of boron was found to facilitate compaction of the composites and improve the wetting between WC and FeAl binder during liquid phase sintering. Increasing the amount of boron in the binder resulted in the melting of binder at lower temperature and increasing of the compacting of the intermetallic tungsten carbide composites...|$|R
30|$|In the {{sputtering}} process, surface atoms or molecules {{are removed}} from a solid cathode (target) by bombarding the target with positive ions from an inert gas discharge and deposited on the nearby substrate to form a thin layer. In the present study, substrates were pumped down in a vacuum chamber to the prescribed process pressure of 3.0 [*]×[*] 10 −[*] 3  Pa. Prior to the coating process, the target was pre-sputtered for 10  min in order to remove any pollutants. The bracket (as substrate) and TiO 2 with 99.99 % purity (as a target) {{were placed in the}} magnetron sputtering chamber. <b>High</b> <b>purity</b> <b>argon</b> was used as the ambient gas. The attachment side of the brackets was not sputtered. The sputtering was conducted for 4  h, the brackets were cooled to room temperature and, subsequently, annealed in nitrogen gas at 450  °C for 2  h.|$|R
