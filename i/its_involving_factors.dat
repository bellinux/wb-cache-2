I'm introducing three different points of view in the theoretical part, how can this issue be seen. First of them, the nursing view (leagal definition of profession), second one is the psychological view (the field of professional identity and <b>its</b> <b>involving</b> <b>factors)</b> and the third view is a social-psychological view (gender and its meaning for nursing profession). In the empiric part I'm presenting two case studies of common attendants, which results mainly from semistructured interviews with common attendants, their subordinate, superiors and sociometric important persons. Data gained from the interviews were consequently completed with data from sociometrie and observation. Key words: nursing, identity, working group, nurse, gende...|$|E
40|$|The plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Ochrobactrum lupini KUDC 1013 {{elicited}} induced systemic resistance (ISR) {{in tobacco}} against soft rot disease caused by Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. We investigated of <b>its</b> <b>factors</b> <b>involved</b> in ISR elicitation. To characterize the ISR determinants, KUDC 1013 cell suspension, heat-treated cells, supernatant from a culture medium, crude bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagella were tested for their ISR activities. Both LPS and flagella from KUDC 1013 were effective in ISR elicitation. Crude cell free supernatant elicited ISR and factors {{with the highest}} ISR activity were retained in the n-butanol fraction. Analysis of the ISR-active fraction revealed the metabolites, phenylacetic acid (PAA), 1 -hexadecene and linoleic acid (LA), as elicitors of ISR. Treatment of tobacco with these compounds significantly decreased the soft rot disease symptoms. This is the first report on the ISR determinants by plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) KUDC 1013 and identifying PAA, 1 -hexadecene and LA as ISR-related compounds. This study shows that KUDC 1013 has a great potential as biological control agent because of <b>its</b> multiple <b>factors</b> <b>involved</b> in induction of systemic resistance against phytopathogens...|$|R

40|$|In {{reference}} to two articles previously {{published in the}} annals of telecommunications journal from; which we will quote a summary in the following paragraph, this paper provides a study of the parametric sensitivity of the transmission lines general model. Indeed, we know that the modeling project of a shielded line subject to current disruption, in any position of <b>its</b> length, <b>involves</b> several <b>factors.</b> Some of these factors have a major influence on the assessment of parasitic tensions; others have lesser importance. So, it is necessary to identify the effect produced on the result by each of them to perform a parametric study.

40|$|Immunofluorescence {{microscopy}} {{revealed the}} presence of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A) on microtubules in neuronal and nonneuronal cells. Interphase and mitotic spindle microtubules, as well as centrosomes, were all labeled with antibodies against individual PP 2 A subunits, showing that the AB alpha C holoenzyme is associated with microtubules. Biochemical analysis showed that PP 2 A could be reversibly bound to microtubules in vitro and that approximately 75 % of the PP 2 A in cytosolic extracts could interact with microtubules. The activity of microtubule-associated PP 2 A was differentially regulated during the cell cycle. Enzymatic activity was high during S phase and intermediate during G 1, while the activity in G 2 and M was 20 -fold lower than during S phase. The amount of microtubule-bound PP 2 A remained constant throughout the cell cycle, implying that cell cycle regulation of <b>its</b> enzymatic activity <b>involves</b> <b>factors</b> other than microtubules. These results raise the possibility that PP 2 A regulates cell cycle-dependent microtubule functions, such as karyokinesis and membrane transport...|$|R

40|$|Contract cheating' has {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} form of academic dishonesty. It involves students contracting out their coursework to writers in order to submit the purchased assignments as their own work, usually via the internet. This form of cheating involves epistemic and ethical problems that are continuous with older forms of cheating, but which it also casts in a new form. It is a concern to educators because {{it is very difficult to}} detect, because it is arguably more fraudulent than some other forms of plagiarism, and because it appears to be connected to a range of systemic problems within modern higher education. This paper provides an overview of the information and literature thus far available on the topic, including its definition, the problems it <b>involves,</b> <b>its</b> causal <b>factors,</b> and the ways in which educators might respond. We argue that while contract cheating is a concern, some of the suggested responses are themselves problematic, and that best practice responses to the issue should avoid moral panic and remain focussed on supporting honest students and good academic practice. 18 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Study ahead, aims at {{examination}} of applicability of multi criteria evaluation in land suitability analysis. In recent years, multiple criteria decision making {{models have been}} entered {{in the field of}} ecological land evaluation studies significantly. Among the important features of multiple criteria decision-making system can be named <b>its</b> <b>involving</b> with various <b>factors</b> weight, or quantifying experts’ opinions in decision-making models. In this study, a region with an extent of 7181 ha was selected in Dohezar Basin (located on northern part of Iran) in which the land capability was evaluated for tourism land use using multi criteria evaluation. All criteria were weighed using experts’ opinion and relevant standards and ultimately areas were selected as suitable places for tourism which have the highest suitability. Compared with the traditional model in which some important factors is ignored due to its limited ability in simultaneous consideration of all effective criteria as well as poor integration and weighting, can be easily inferred that such a model can not be held accountable in watershed decision-making levels, especially in small and complex physiographic conditions. In multiple criteria evaluation methods, all the indicators after forming the decision matrix and weighting process, were integrated and classified based on the rating received for tourism potentiality, and the suitability map for the tourism land use was prepared. The results of this approach, while consistent with the existing conditions, also has made possible the appropriate decision making to allocate the land to different land uses...|$|R

The large number of <b>involved</b> <b>factors</b> makes certain analyses which are usually conducted on the {{simulation models}} prohibitive or impractical. These analyses may include building predictive metamodels, finding the optimum factor settings for the simulated system, and etc. Factor Screening experiments are intended to examine all or some of the <b>involved</b> <b>factors</b> to identify those with significant effect on a selected response (output). The identified important factors can then be used in subsequent analyses. This thesis is focused on factor screening methods with promising performance on simulation models from the medical decision making community with a relatively large number of factors. Two groups of factor screening methods are addressed: classical designs which are generally used for physical systems, and recent designs which have been exclusively developed for simulation models.
