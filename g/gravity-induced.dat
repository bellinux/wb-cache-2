50|$|Additionally, {{the time}} of {{polymerization}} of a gel may directly affect the peak-elution times of separated metalloproteins in the electropherogram due to the compression and dilatation of the gels and their pores with the longer incubation times (see figure Electropherogram, cf. section Reproducibility and recovery). In order to ensure maximum reproducibility in gel pore size and to obtain a fully polymerized and non-restrictive large pore gel for a PAGE run, the polyacrylamide gel is polymerized for a time period of 69 hr at room temperature (RT). The exothermic heat generated by the polymerization processes is dissipated constantly while the temperature may rise rapidly to over 75 °C in the first minutes, after which it falls slowly. After 69 hr the gel has room temperature, and thus, is in its lowest energy state because the chemical reactions in these processes are terminated. As a result, the prepared gel is homogeneous (in terms of homogeneous distribution of cross-linksthroughout the gel sample), inherently stable and free of monomers or radicals. Fresh polyacrylamide gels are further hydrophilic, electrically neutral and do not bind proteins. Therefore, the hydrolysis of the polyacrylamide gels in the usual basic and acidic buffers (pH 4 to 10) has no essential effects on the protein separation process (cf. section Principle). Molecular sieving due to <b>gravity-induced</b> compression of the gel can be excluded for same reasons. In a medium without molecular sieving properties a high-resolution can be expected.|$|E

Newcomen's engine appears to have been based on Papin's experiments carried out 30 years earlier, and employed a piston and cylinder, one end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston. Steam just above atmospheric pressure (all that the boiler could stand) was introduced into {{the lower half of the}} cylinder beneath the piston during the <b>gravity-induced</b> upstroke; the steam was then condensed by a jet of cold water injected into the steam space to produce a partial vacuum; the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the vacuum on either side of the piston displaced it downwards into the cylinder, raising the opposite end of a rocking beam to which was attached a gang of gravity-actuated reciprocating force pumps housed in the mineshaft. The engine's downward power stroke raised the pump, priming it and preparing the pumping stroke. At first the phases were controlled by hand, but within ten years an escapement mechanism had been devised worked by of a vertical plug tree suspended from the rocking beam which rendered the engine self-acting.|$|E

This paper investigates the hypothesis that intravertebral (within the bone) rotation in idiopathic scoliosis is caused by growth in the presence of <b>gravity-induced</b> torsions. Three dimensional spinal curvature was measured for a small group of idiopathic scoliosis patients using standing radiographs, and equations of static equilibrium were used to calculate <b>gravity-induced</b> torsion profiles along the length of each spine. Intravertebral rotations were then measured for the same patients using Aaro & Dahlborn’s technique with reformatted computed tomography images. Torsion curves were compared with rotation measurements to see whether <b>gravity-induced</b> torsion is a likely contributor to intravertebral rotation in scoliosis. Results showed <b>gravity-induced</b> torques as high as 7. 5 Nm acting on the spines of idiopathic scoliosis patients due to static body weight in the standing position, and maximum intravertebral rotations (for a single vertebra) of approximately 7 .

Summary of Background Data. Vertebral rotation is {{an important aspect of}} spinal deformity in idiopathic scoliosis, associated with ribcage asymmetry. Although both lateral curvature and rotation seem to increase together in progressive scoliosis, the mechanisms driving vertebral rotation are not clearly established and it is not known whether lateral curvature precedes rotation, or vice versa. Methods. Three-dimensional spinal curvature was measured for a small group of idiopathic scoliosis patients using standing radiographs, and equations of static equilibrium were used to calculate <b>gravity-induced</b> torque profiles along the length of each spine because of head, neck, and torso weight. Vertebral rotations were then measured for the same patients using Aaro and Dahlborn's technique with reformatted computed tomography images. The <b>gravity-induced</b> torque curves were compared with rotation measurements to see whether <b>gravity-induced</b> torque is a likely contributor to intravertebral rotation in scoliosis. Results. <b>Gravity-induced</b> torques as high as 7. 5 Nm act on the spines of idiopathic scoliosis patients because of body weight in the standing position, and maximum intravertebral rotations (for a single vertebra) are approximately 4 degrees. There is a statistically significant relationship between <b>gravity-induced</b> torque and intravertebral rotation in the scoliotic spine. Conclusion. <b>Gravity-induced</b> torque is a likely cause of intravertebral rotation in progressive idiopathic scoliosis. Because the spine must be curved in 3 -dimensions (out of plane) to produce such torques, vertebral rotation would be expected to occur subsequent to an initial lateral deviation, suggesting that lateral curvature precedes vertebral rotation in progressive idiopathic scoliosis...|$|E

The effects of <b>gravity-induced</b> convection on deposit structure and kinetic behavior of metal electrodeposition were studied. It was found that copper powders and copper foils were easily electrodeposited by inhibiting and enhancing <b>gravity-induced</b> convection, respectively. Current efficiency was also increased from 31. 5 % to 92. 7 % due to enhancing <b>gravity-induced</b> convection. Double logarithm relationships between limiting current density (id) and gravity coefficient (G) for both copper and nickel electrodeposition were obtained at various metal ion concentrations. It was confirmed that diffusion coefficient was about 2. 25 - 3. 47 x 10 (- 6) cm(2) s(- 1) and almost independent on gravity acceleration. However, diffusion layer thickness of copper electrodeposition in 0. 01 M CuSO 4 solution was only 0. 82 x 10 (- 2) cm under G value of 354 due to larger flow velocity, and was much lower than that under normal gravity condition (3. 41 x 10 (- 2) cm).

For this purpose, we examined the downward movement of starch-filled chloroplast gravisensors, differential changes in inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) levels, transport of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) and gravitropic curvature. Upon gravistimulation, the ratio for IAA levels in lower halves versus those in upper halves (L/U) increased from 1. 0 at 0 [*]h and reached a maximum value of 1. 45 at 8 [*]h. When shoots were grown in the dark for 10 [*]d, to deplete starch in the chloroplast, the <b>gravity-induced</b> L/U of IAA was reduced to 1. 0. N -naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA), both auxin transport inhibitors, significantly reduced the amount of gravitropic curvature and <b>gravity-induced</b> lateral IAA transport, but did not reduce the <b>gravity-induced</b> late change in the L/U ratio of IP 3 levels. U 73122, a specific phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, decreased <b>gravity-induced</b> curvature. Because U 73122 reduced the ratio of L/U of IAA imposed by gravistimulation, it is clear that IAA transport is correlated with changes in IP 3 levels upon gravistimulation.

When electrostatic repulsion is significant, particles can flocculate into either a primary or secondary minimum (as described by DLVO theory), or remain dispersed.

The dominantly carbonate composition of the rocks outcropping along the slope, the occurrence of a main spring fed by a regional karst aquifer and the interaction of <b>gravity-induced</b> deformations with buildings and infrastructures resting on the slope or located at its base make the investigated case extremely interesting and reflective of phenomena that are common in similar geological-hydrogeological conditions.
