5|$|A Fistful of Dollars {{proved a}} {{landmark}} {{in the development}} of spaghetti Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re-hired to star in For a Few Dollars More (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to For a Few Dollars More and the final film of the trilogy (The <b>Good,</b> <b>the</b> Bad and the Ugly) were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.|$|E
5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature of the gift, Norton saved the cigar, keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years later, when the school was {{shutting}} its doors for <b>good,</b> <b>the</b> alumni thought it would be a fitting gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E

40|$|We {{solve for}} the optimal {{mechanism}} for selling two <b>goods</b> when <b>the</b> buyer’s demand characteristics are unobservable. In {{the case of}} substitutable <b>goods,</b> <b>the</b> seller has an incentive to offer lotteries over goods in order to charge the buyers with large differences in the valuations a higher price for obtaining their desired good with certainty. However, the seller also has a countervailing incentive to make the allocation of <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> among <b>the</b> participating buyers more efficient {{in order to increase}} the overall demand. In the case when the buyer can consume both <b>goods,</b> <b>the</b> seller has an incentive to underprovide one of <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> in order to charge the buyers with large valuations a higher price for the bundle of both <b>goods.</b> As in <b>the</b> case of substitutable <b>goods,</b> <b>the</b> seller also has a countervailing incentive to lower the price of the bundle in order to increase the overall demand. ...|$|R
5|$|After five {{straight}} championship wins in the AAFC and NFL, the Browns appeared poised to bring another trophy home in 1951. The team finished {{the regular season}} with 11 wins and a single loss {{in the first game}} of the season. Cleveland faced the Rams on December 23 in a rematch of the previous year's title game. The score was deadlocked 17–17 in the final period, but a 73-yard touchdown pass by Rams quarterback Norm van Brocklin to wide receiver Tom Fears broke the tie and gave Los Angeles the lead for <b>good.</b> <b>The</b> 24–17 loss was the Browns' first in a championship game.|$|E
5|$|Before the First World War, the Spanish Army {{bought a}} Schneider-Brillié in 1909 {{to be used}} in Melilla, where armed {{conflict}} with local tribes was going on. This was a French bus platform that was fitted with an armoured body, to be used as troop transport. Although it was big, slow and its performance was not <b>good,</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Army learned the value of armored vehicles and bought a second one. Spanish Army officers appreciated the advantages of using advanced weapons technology in the Colonial War in Spanish Morocco and followed First World War advances.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria's {{relationship}} with its neighbours since 1990 {{has generally been}} <b>good.</b> <b>The</b> country also {{plays an important role}} in promoting regional security. Bulgaria has an active tripartite economic and diplomatic collaboration with Romania and Greece, maintains strong relations with EU members, the United States, and Russia, and continues to improve its traditionally good ties with China and Vietnam. The HIV trial in Libya, which followed after the imprisonment of several Bulgarian nurses in Benghazi in 1998, had a significant impact on relations between Bulgaria, the European Union, and Libya. It resulted in the release of the nurses by Muammar Gaddafi's government, which was granted a contract to receive a nuclear reactor and weapons supplies from France in exchange.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos are {{versatile}} feeders {{and consume}} {{a range of}} mainly vegetable food items. Seeds form {{a large part of}} the diet of all species; these are opened with their large and powerful bills. The galahs, corellas and some of the black cockatoos feed primarily on the ground; others feed mostly in trees. The ground-feeding species tend to forage in flocks, which form tight, squabbling groups where seeds are concentrated and dispersed lines where food is more sparsely distributed; they also prefer open areas where visibility is <b>good.</b> <b>The</b> western and long-billed corellas have elongated bills to excavate tubers and roots and the Major Mitchell's cockatoo walks in a circle around the doublegree (Emex australis) to twist out and remove the underground parts.|$|E
5|$|Curtin {{replied to}} Churchill and Roosevelt on 8 December, and again {{stressed}} the need to return the 9th Division to Australia {{as soon as possible}} to make <b>good</b> <b>the</b> Army's losses to tropical diseases and prepare for future offensives in the Pacific. In his message he agreed to leave the division's heavy equipment in the Middle East, and requested only that it travel with items necessary to quickly re-enter combat in the South West Pacific. No further debate took place, and on 15 December Churchill informed Curtin that shipping would be made available in late January to transport the division and a small portion of its equipment to Australia.|$|E

5|$|Following the missed field goal, Virginia Tech's offense {{took over}} at their 27-yard line, the spot {{from which the}} kick had been missed.

After a pass from Taylor fell incomplete, he completed his next two attempts for a total gain of 19yards and a first down. Virginia Tech then committed a five-yard false start penalty, pushing the Hokies back to the Cincinnati 26-yard line. With time running out in the quarter, however, Virginia Tech running back Josh Oglesby made <b>good</b> <b>the</b> penalty with a 13-yard run to the Cincinnati 23-yard line.

5|$|On {{the other}} side, {{there were still}} huge numbers of Roman Catholics. Some conformed, bending with the times, hoping {{that there would be}} a fresh reverse. Vestments were still hidden, golden candlesticks bequeathed, chalices kept. The Mass was still celebrated in some places {{alongside}} the new Communion service but was more difficult than before. Both Roman Catholic priests and laity lived a double life, apparently conforming, but avoiding taking the oath of conformity. Only as time passed did recusancy—refusal to attend Protestant services—became more common. Jesuits and seminary priests, trained in Douai and Rome to make <b>good</b> <b>the</b> losses of English priests, encouraged this.|$|E
5|$|Paltrow's guest {{appearance}} attracted positive commentary, but the episode's sub-plots {{were less}} well received. Aly Semigran of MTV, Robert Canning of IGN and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack all deemed the episode {{one of the}} best of the season. Time James Poniewozik felt that it was a relatively subdued, mediocre episode, and Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club found it to be an improvement on the previous two episodes, if not genuinely <b>good.</b> <b>The</b> National Alliance on Mental Illness criticized the episode for its depiction of bipolar disorder. Paltrow won the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance.|$|E
5|$|Swifts as {{a family}} have smaller egg {{clutches}} and much longer and more variable incubation and fledging times than passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling tubenoses in these developmental factors. Young birds reach a maximum weight heavier than their parents; they can cope with not being fed {{for long periods of}} time, and delay their feather growth when undernourished. Swifts and seabirds have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful. These adaptations mean that when conditions are <b>good,</b> <b>the</b> survival rate is very high. One large Yellow Sea colony had hatching success of 73.5%, with 63.6% of the chicks fledging. The average productivity was 1.24fledged young per pair per year.|$|E
