5|$|I {{called to}} him to turn hard opposite, so I could {{sandwich}} the Red fighters, but in his standard-rate bomber turn he got hit. I saw {{the whole thing and}} ordered him to dive and bail out immediately. To my intense relief <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> leave the aircraft and his parachute blossom. I was happy to get this Airacobra, but I was mad at myself for not harkening to my intuition not to fly with Günther Capito.|$|E
5|$|We {{took off}} from the {{concrete}} runway in Leck, Kirchner (Fhj.Fw Günther Kirchner) stayed 30 metres behind me on my right side as usual;... We climbed up to about 200 metres, when suddenly two Thunderbolts appeared behind us and instantly shot down Günther Kirchner's plane. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> jettison canopy and catapult but his parachute did not deploy. I was very lucky that the Thunderbolts did not press on with another attack.|$|E
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E

5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E

In the end, I think he found comfort in knowing that what he did saved some airmen's lives, and that was worth more to him than four stars.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{everybody}} pays him homage. I nearly blow my top. I {{can still}} hear {{the way he was}} whistled when he rode. I think of the organisers of the Tour, who shortened the time trial to make him lose. His home town of Rouen organises commemorations but, me, I haven't forgotten that it was in Antwerp that he made his farewell appearance. More than once, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> crying in his hotel room after suffering the spitting and insults of spectators. People said he was cold, a calculator, a dilettante. The truth is that Jacques was a monster of courage. In the mountains, he suffered as though he was damned. He wasn't a climber. But with bluffing, with guts, he tore them to shreds (il les a tous couillonnés).|$|E

25|$|Just as I {{was pushing}} {{one of our}} men back into the ranks <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> fall at my feet from a sabre slash. I turned round instantly– to see English cavalry forcing their way into our midst and hacking us to pieces. Just as it is difficult, if not impossible, for the best cavalry to break into {{infantry}} who are formed into squares and who defend themselves with coolness and daring, so {{it is true that}} once the ranks have been penetrated, then resistance is useless and nothing remains for the cavalry to do but to slaughter at almost no risk to themselves. This what happened, in vain our poor fellows stood up and stretched out their arms; they could not reach far enough to bayonet these cavalrymen mounted on powerful horses, and the few shots fired in chaotic melee were just as fatal to our own men as to the English. And so we found ourselves defenceless against a relentless enemy who, in the intoxication of battle, sabred even our drummers and fifers without mercy.|$|E
500|$|Collaborator John Fleming said of {{him that}} [...] "At home, he {{occasionally}} put a live goldfish in his mouth to get attention – <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> do it twice.

500|$|Though as a {{minor league}} prospect, analysts derided his {{defensive}} potential, with one calling him [...] "terrible", he progressively improved. Late in 2013, Sandberg commented on his defensive improvement: [...] "I see tremendous progress on his footwork out there, his reads on balls, his quickness, his reacting to the hops and getting the hop he wants. It looks like he's really worked on his glove play, just using the glove along with his strong accurate arm. It's a very true ball that he throws over there. It's got a lot on it. I've {{seen a lot of}} improving developments since <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> in mid-February. He's come a long way." ...|$|E
500|$|Miles Morales {{was created}} by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli. Bendis' {{thoughts}} about the character, {{and the way he}} looked in his first appearance, were heavily influenced by African American actor Donald Glover's appearance in Spider-Man pajamas in [...] "Anthropology 101", the second season premiere of the television comedy series Community. This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man. Bendis said of Glover, [...] "He looked fantastic! <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> in the costume and thought, 'I would like to read that book.' So I was glad I was writing that book." ...|$|E
500|$|Although they {{initially}} parted on {{good terms}} when Taylor retired in May 1982, the relationship was finally damaged permanently after a dispute over the transfer in May 1983 of John Robertson from Forest to Derby, where Taylor was now managing. Clough was apparently angered that Taylor did not inform him about the deal. Clough attacked Taylor in a tabloid article on 3 July 1983 as being a [...] "rattlesnake", [...] "a snake-in-the-grass" [...] and said that [...] "We pass {{each other on the}} A52 going to work on most days of the week.

[...] She confirmed that the incident further inspired [...] "Swine", saying, [...] "I wrote a song called 'Swine'; the song is about rape. The song is about demoralization.

500|$|McKinley's most {{controversial}} Cabinet appointment {{was that of}} John Sherman as Secretary of State. Sherman had an outstanding reputation but old age was fast reducing his abilities. [...] McKinley needed to have Hanna appointed to the Senate so Senator Sherman was moved up. [...] Sherman's mental faculties were decaying even in 1896; this was widely spoken of in political circles, but McKinley {{did not believe the}} rumors. Nevertheless, McKinley sent his cousin, William McKinley Osborne, to have dinner with the 73-year-old senator; he reported back that Sherman seemed as lucid as ever. McKinley wrote once the appointment was announced, [...] "the stories regarding Senator Sherman's 'mental decay' are without foundation... When <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> last I was convinced both of his perfect health, physically and mentally, and that the prospects of life were remarkably good." ...|$|E

He said he had used up his bad luck." [...] In February 1943, the Associated Press ran a feature story about Gedeon's war service under the headline: [...] "Gedeon Will Return to Baseball If War Doesn’t Last Too Long." [...] Gedeon was quoted in the article as saying [...] "he hopes to pick up after the war where he left off." [...] He added that [...] "it's a matter of time."
