40|$|PURPOSE: In Burkina Faso, {{gold ore}} {{is one of}} the main sources of income for an {{important}} part of the active population. Artisan gold miners use mercury in the extraction, a toxic metal whose human health risks are well known. The aim of the present study was to assess mercury exposure as well as to understand the exposure determinants of gold miners in Burkinabe small-scale mines. METHODS: The examined gold miners' population on the different selected gold mining sites was composed by persons who were directly and indirectly related to gold mining activities. But measurement of urinary mercury was performed on workers most susceptible to be exposed to mercury. Thus, occupational exposure to mercury was evaluated among ninety-three workers belonging to eight different gold mining sites spread in six regions of Burkina Faso. Among others, work-related exposure determinants were taken into account for each person during urine sampling as for example amalgamating or heating mercury. All participants were medically examined by a local medical team in order to identify possible symptoms related to the toxic effect of mercury. RESULTS: Mercury levels were high, showing that 69 % of the measurements exceeded the ACGIH (American Conference of Industrial Hygienists) biological exposure indice (BEI) of 35 µg per g of creatinine (µg/g-Cr) (prior to shift) while 16 % even exceeded 350 µg/g-Cr. Basically, unspecific but also specific symptoms related to mercury toxicity could be underlined among the persons who were directly related to gold mining activities. Only one-third among the studied subpopulation reported about less than three symptoms possibly associated to mercury exposure and nearly half of them suffered from at least five of these symptoms. Ore washers were more involved in the direct <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> while gold dealers in the final gold recovery activities. These differences may explain the overexposure observed in gold dealers and indicate that the refining process is the major source of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This study attests that mercury exposure still is an issue of concern. North-South collaborations should encourage knowledge exchange between developing and developed countries, for a cleaner artisanal gold mining process and thus for reducing human health and environmental hazards due to mercury use...|$|E

We examined the disposition of Hg 2 + in Mrp 22 / 2 mice and assessed the transport of mercuric conjugates in inside-out membrane vesicles containing human MRP 4.

The effect of Hg 2 + exposure on renal GSH levels was also assessed in these mice. Our data suggest that MRP 2, but not MRP 4, is involved in proximal tubular export of Hg 2 +. In addition, GSH levels are greater in Mrp 22 / 2 mice and exposure to Hg 2 + reduced renal levels of GSH.

40|$|Background and Aim: Dental Amalgam is {{a common}} {{restorative}} material for posterior teeth. Because of Hg content {{in the composition of}} amalgam, during the <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> material, <b>mercury</b> may release as vapor in the environment. Excess amount <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> vapor can cause serious health problems in dental personnel. The aim of this investigation was to determine mercury vapor concentration in working environment of dentists in Tehran. Materials and Methods: 211 dental clinics were participated in this cross-sectional study. The clinics were randomly selected from different regions of Tehran (north, center, south, east and west). The dentists were asked to complete a questionnaire including items on demographic characteristics such as age, sex and work history, method <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> amalgam, environmental characteristics and general health conditions. Environmental measurements <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> vapor in dentists’ offices were done by mercury absorption tubes (Hydrar) and personal pumps (SKC, 222 - 3, England) as suggested in NIOSH method. Analysis of air samples was done by atomic absorption spectrophotometery (cold vapor). The data were analyzed by non-parametric tests (Kruskall Wallis, Mann-Whitney and Kendall). P< 0. 05 as the level of significance. Results: The mean mercury vapor concentration in dentists’ offices was 8. 39 (± 9. 68) µg/m³. There was no significant relationship between the urine <b>mercury</b> <b>of</b> dentists (3. 107 ± 3. 95) and the air Hg vapor concentration of their offices. Using precapsulated amalgam showed significantly less Hg vapor than bulk amalgam (P= 0. 034). Also the surface area of working room and air Hg vapor (P= 0. 009) had a significant relationship (P= 0. 009 r= 0. 81). There was not any significant correlation between mercury vapor and other factors such as working hours per day and working days per week, squeezing of triturated amalgam or not, storage medium of set amalgam (water or fixer solution), mercury storage method and type of ventilation. Conclusion: The concentration <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> vapor in dental offices' environment was lower than threshold limit value.
