5|$|A segment with Raven {{took place}} where he demanded {{to be placed in}} the main event for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Larry Zbyszko disagreed, {{resulting}} in Raven attacking him before security pulled Raven off. Rhino then came out and stated that he <b>deserved</b> <b>the</b> title shot more than Raven.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} 2008 Olympics, Crawford competed against Martina {{again in a}} meet in Zurich, Switzerland. At a hotel {{during the course of}} the meet, Crawford left the silver medal for Martina, believing that Martina <b>deserved</b> <b>the</b> medal more than he.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversial}} Peace Prize {{was that}} awarded to Barack Obama in 2009. Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as President of the United States, {{but the actual}} evaluation occurred over the next eight months. Obama himself stated {{that he did not}} feel deserving of the award, or worthy of the company it would place him in. Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama <b>deserved</b> <b>the</b> award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.|$|E

5|$|Cinderella teams TnC Gaming and Digital Chaos, {{who were}} both {{projected}} to finish {{near the bottom}} of the final standings, exceeded expectations, with the latter eventually reaching the Grand Finals, finishing as the tournament's runner-up. Game one of the upper bracket series between Evil Geniuses and EHOME was thought by Patrick Hancock of Destructoid to be more exciting than any traditional sporting match he had ever seen, with him comparing moments during the game to famous American football plays such as the Helmet Catch. Seattle KCPQ reporter Kaci Aitchison, who co-hosted the event, thought that due to the International's large prize pools and production values, eSports had become a true spectator sport which <b>deserved</b> <b>the</b> same level of respect of traditional sports.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, three of the Bruins' best forwards decided to join the Royal Canadian Air Force midway through the 1941–42 season. These three forwards made up the Kraut Line, {{one of the best}} lines in the NHL. Despite missing three of their best players, the Bruins managed to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals the next season. In the finals, they were eliminated by the Red Wings, four games to none. Due to his play in the regular season, Brimsek was again named to the NHL Second All-Star Team. However, it was popular opinion at the time that Brimsek <b>deserved</b> <b>the</b> spot on the First All-Star Team over Johnny Mowers, including Mowers' own coach and general manager, Jack Adams.|$|E
5|$|Kasab's {{trial began}} on 6 May 2009. He {{initially}} pleaded not guilty, but later admitted his guilt on 20 July 2009. He initially apologised {{for the attacks}} and claimed that he <b>deserved</b> <b>the</b> death penalty for his crimes, but later retracted these claims, {{saying that he had}} been tortured by police to force his confession, and that he had been arrested while roaming the beach. The court had accepted his plea, but {{due to the lack of}} completeness within his admittance, the judge had deemed that many of the 86 charges were not addressed and therefore the trial continued.|$|E

5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein {{was well aware of}} the Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter he sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men <b>deserved</b> <b>the</b> watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter was the only time that Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|Tan {{and four}} blind friends auditioned for the inaugural season of Project SuperStar, but only he was {{accepted}} as a contestant. Throughout the competition, there was extensive debate over whether viewers were voting for him out of sympathy and whether a blind man who could not dance <b>deserved</b> <b>the</b> title. Further controversy arose when his home address was posted online and fans offered him sex services. Nevertheless, he emerged as the male champion and entered the grand final against female champion Kelly Poon. The judges gave Poon more favourable reviews, but Tan garnered 64% of the 533,000 telephone votes. Both finalists also released limited edition singles; Tan's cover of 童话 (Fairytale) by Michael Wong sold 12,239 copies, while Poon's cover of 遗失的美好 (Lost Goodness) by Angela Chang sold 11,319 copies. Thus Tan became the grand champion and was awarded a recording contract with Play Music (later acquired by Warner Music).|$|E
5|$|On 1 October 1938 Zaolzie was annexed by Poland {{following}} the Munich Conference. The Polish Army, commanded by General Władysław Bortnowski, annexed {{an area of}} 801.5km² (309.5mi²) {{with a population of}} 227,399. The Polish side argued that Poles in Zaolzie <b>deserved</b> <b>the</b> same rights as Germans in the Munich Agreement. The vast majority of the local Polish population enthusiastically welcomed the change, seeing it as a liberation and a form of historical justice. But they quickly changed their mood. The new Polish authorities appointed people from Poland to various positions from which Czechs had been dismissed. The Polish language became the sole official language. Rapid Polonization followed. Czech organizations were dismantled and their activity was prohibited. Czech education ceased to exist. About 35,000 Czechs emigrated to Czechoslovakia by choice or forcibly. The behaviour of the new Polish authorities was different but similar in nature to that of the Czech authorities before 1938. Two political factions appeared: socialists (the opposition) and rightists (loyal to the new authorities). Leftist politicians and sympathizers were discriminated against and often dismissed from their jobs. The Polish political system was artificially implemented in Zaolzie. Local Polish people continued to feel like second-class citizens and a majority of them were dissatisfied with the situation after October 1938. Zaolzie remained a part of Poland for only eleven months.|$|E

5|$|The Polish side {{argued that}} Poles in Zaolzie <b>deserved</b> <b>the</b> same ethnic rights and freedom as the Sudeten Germans under the Munich Agreement. The vast {{majority}} of the local Polish population enthusiastically welcomed the change, seeing it as a liberation and a form of historical justice, but they quickly changed their mood. The new Polish authorities appointed people from Poland to various key positions from which locals were fired. The Polish language became the sole official language. Using Czech (or German) by Czechs (or Germans) in public was prohibited and Czechs and Germans were being forced to leave the annexed area or become subject to Polonization. Rapid Polonization policies then followed in all parts of public and private life. Czech organizations were dismantled and their activity was prohibited. The Roman Catholic parishes in the area belonged either to the Archdiocese of Breslau (Archbishop Bertram) or to the Archdiocese of Olomouc (Archbishop Leopold Prečan), respectively, both traditionally comprising cross-border diocesan territories in Czechoslovakia and Germany. When the Polish government demanded after its takeover that the parishes there be disentangled from these two archdioceses, the Holy See complied. Pope Pius XI, former nuncio to Poland, subjected the Catholic parishes in Zaolzie to an apostolic administration under Stanisław Adamski, Bishop of Katowice.|$|E
