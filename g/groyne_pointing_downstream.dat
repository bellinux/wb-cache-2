40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the refrigerated wind tunnel at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, Langley Field, Va., to determine a suitable method for preventing the formation of ice on the vents of airplane gasoline tanks. Tests were made {{on a variety of}} vent forms arranged {{in a number of different}} orientations relative to the direction of the air stream. Both the size of the tube and its orientation were found to be of great importance. Small tubes, under equal circumstances, were found to freeze over far more rapidly than large ones. Tubes <b>pointing</b> <b>downstream,</b> or shielded in other ways, appear to be perfectly immune against this hazard. A tube 3 / 4 inch in diameter with the opening <b>pointing</b> <b>downstream</b> is finally recommended as being the safest choice of gas tank vent...|$|R

50|$|Although {{there was}} a {{crossing}} at Over recorded in the Domesday Book, this famous bridge was built by Thomas Telford between 1825 and 1828, to carry traffic east-west.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Price Creek {{was a clear}} stream until it arrived at the Johnson Colliery, where mine water and waste water was drained into it.

50|$|The Webbs Creek Ferry {{is one of}} two cable ferry {{crossings}} at Wisemans Ferry, {{the other}} being the eponymous Wisemans Ferry, which crosses the Hawkesbury River to a <b>point</b> <b>downstream</b> of the confluence with the Macdonald River. Two other such ferries cross the Hawkesbury River proper, these being the Sackville Ferry and the Lower Portland Ferry, whilst a fifth ferry, the Berowra Waters Ferry, crosses a side-arm of the river.|$|R
50|$|At various <b>points</b> <b>downstream,</b> {{the rivers}} flow {{together}} and then separate again, often leading to flooding and water damage. Since the Edo period, much {{work has been done}} to plan dykes and other structures that will help control the rivers. In the late part of the 19th century, rulers of the Satsuma domain worked with the Dutch engineer Johannis de Rijke to help with flood control of the area.|$|R
50|$|Through Oklahoma and Arkansas, dams artificially deepen and {{widen the}} river to build it into a {{commercial}}ly navigable body of water. From {{the mouth of the}} Verdigris, to the <b>point</b> <b>downstream</b> where the McClellan-Kerr system moves over to the White River near Arkansas Post in far eastern Arkansas, the Arkansas sustains commercial barge traffic and offers passenger and recreational use through what is often little more than a series of reservoirs.|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} a history of the {{attempts}} to control the encroachment of salinity from San Francisco Bay into the Delta of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers from 1920 to the present.

500|$|The {{headwaters}} of Leggetts Creek are {{outside of the}} Lackawanna Valley. At Providence, the creek flowed directly southeast prior to the glacial period, reaching the Lackawanna River approximately [...] downstream of its current location. However, the course now flows to the east instead. The old course of the creek has been build over. There is a ledge on the north bank of Leggetts Creek in its lower reaches. The creek makes a sharp eastward bend around Providence. From this <b>point</b> <b>downstream</b> to its mouth, it flows through a rocky channel that contains a thick covering of till on its upper walls.|$|R
50|$|Easily {{accessible}} {{from the}} boat launch at the Tangle Lakes campground near the Denali Highway and at many <b>points</b> <b>downstream</b> along the Richardson Highway, the river can be floated in sections that vary in difficulty from Class I (easy) to Class V (extremely difficult) on the International Scale of River Difficulty and may require portages. The upstream stretches include four lakes and their Class II (medium) connecting channels. About 2 mi downstream of the last lake, the river enters a canyon and flows over unrunnable waterfalls. A 0.5 mi portage leads to a 2 mi stretch of Class III (difficult) rapids.|$|R
50|$|Consider a pipe {{containing}} a flowing fluid. When a valve is either fully or partially closed at some <b>point</b> <b>downstream,</b> the fluid {{will continue to}} flow at the original velocity. In order to counteract {{the momentum of the}} fluid, the pressure will rise significantly (pressure surge) just upstream of the control valve and may result in damage to the pipe system. If a surge chamber is connected to the pipeline just upstream of the valve, on valve closure, the fluid, instead of being stopped suddenly by the valve, will flow upwards into the chamber, hence reducing the surge pressures experienced in the pipeline.|$|R
40|$|The {{thickness}} growth {{characteristics of}} flowing lava are investigated using a heat balance model and a two-dimensional model for flow of a Bingham plastic fluid down an inclined plane. It is found that yield strength plays {{a crucial role}} in the thickening of a lava flow of given flow rate. To illustrate this <b>point,</b> <b>downstream</b> thickness profiles and yield strength distributions were calculated for flows with mass flow rates of 10, 000 and 100, 000 kg/m-sec. Higher flow rates led to slow cooling rates which resulted in slow rate of increase of yield strength and thus greater flow lengths...|$|R

Minimisation of the blow-up at injection by tuning independently the Twiss parameters (a,b), the dispersion D and the dispersion derivative D' is therefore mandatory. The optics of the transfer line between the PS and SPS machines was modelled and matched using the program package MAD. Tuning knobs were developed using a singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm.
