5|$|Stealth {{is based}} on {{limiting}} the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding behind an object, the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, {{and as long as}} Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can also look through <b>keyholes</b> to gain insight into closed rooms. Sneaking up behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or dead bodies can be moved and hidden.|$|E
5|$|Enemy {{detection}} {{works on}} line-of-sight, with players {{being able to}} use cover or high areas out of enemies' cones of vision to stay undetected. Darkness can aid the player in staying hidden, {{but it is only}} effective at a distance. Enemy alert meters and musical cues let the player know if they've been spotted. Noise will cause enemies to go to investigate, including noise made by broken bottles or the player striking a sword against the wall; this may be used deliberately to lure guards into traps or disrupt their patrol route. Players can look through <b>keyholes</b> to help them survey a room before entering, and can lean to look from cover without fully exposing themselves. The player is now able to be detected if they peer out from behind a wall for too long, a feature not seen in Dishonored. To avoid detection, the player may choke people out or have their throat slit. Bodies can be carried away and concealed. Alarms can be disabled to assure that enemies are not alerted to the player's presence. Walls of Light, barriers powered by wind or whale oil, are subject to have their power turned off or be rewired so that only enemies are killed by going through them. Whale oil canisters explode on harsh impact, and can be thrown at enemies to that end.|$|E

40|$|<b>Keyhole</b> {{plasma arc}} welding {{achieves}} much deeper penetration than do all other existing arc welding processes. Because {{of its ability to}} penetrate thicker material, the control of the <b>keyhole</b> in {{plasma arc welding}} becomes critical. From an analysis of the physical process, a sensor to detect the state of the <b>keyhole</b> for <b>keyhole</b> process control has been proposed and developed. This sensor measures the electrical effect of the plasma cloud generated during <b>keyhole</b> plasma arc welding. It is found that the plasma cloud, which rapidly decreases to zero upon establishment of the fully penetrated <b>keyhole,</b> can be used to detect the state of the <b>keyhole</b> reliably.

40|$|AbstractDuring <b>keyhole</b> {{welding with}} lasers a surplus {{pressure}} has to act at the <b>keyhole</b> front which drives the molten material around the <b>keyhole.</b> Depending on the travel speed and <b>keyhole</b> diameter, its value can reach several bar and may, therefore, represent {{a significant contribution}} to the pressure balance in the <b>keyhole.</b> As a consequence, an effect also on its stability must be expected therefrom. On the basis of simplified, yet physically reasonable estimations, the pressure balance in the <b>keyhole</b> for a wide parameter range of travel speed and <b>keyhole</b> diameter is inspected in detail. By comparing the magnitude of dynamic pressure of the melt flow at the <b>keyholeâ€˜s</b> side to the other contributions to <b>keyhole</b> pressure, i. e. ambient pressure and closing pressure due to surface tension, different parameter regimes can be identified where a <b>keyhole</b> with a stable geometry can exist and where not.

40|$|Camera {{observations}} of the full penetration <b>keyhole</b> laser welding process show that the <b>keyhole</b> shape is elongated under certain welding conditions. Under these unfavourable circumstances, the welding process is susceptible to holes in the weld bead. Existing models of the pressure balance at the <b>keyhole</b> wall cannot explain this <b>keyhole</b> elongation. In this paper a new model is presented, accounting for the doubly curved shape of the <b>keyhole</b> wall. In this model, the surface tension pressure has one term that tends to close the <b>keyhole</b> and another term that tries to open it. Model calculations show that when the <b>keyhole</b> diameter is of the same order as the sheet thickness, the latter part can become dominant, causing the <b>keyhole</b> to elongate. Experiments on thin aluminium (AA 5182) and mild steel (DC 04) sheets verify these model calculations. As the <b>keyhole</b> radius depends on the radius of the focused laser spot, it was found for both materials that {{the ratio of the}} spot radius and the sheet thickness must be above a critical value to prevent <b>keyhole</b> elongation. These critical radii are 0. 25 for AA 5182 and 0. 4 for DC 04, respectively. Furthermore, differences in appearance of the weld bead between the circular and the elongated <b>keyhole</b> welds could be explained by this model...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The dynamic <b>keyhole</b> is a newMRimage {{reconstruction}} {{method for}} thoracic and abdominal MR imaging. To date, this method {{has not been}} investigated with cancer patient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The goal {{of this study was}} to assess the dynamic <b>keyhole</b> method for the task of lung tumor localization using cine-MR images reconstructed in the presence of respiratory motion. Methods: The dynamic <b>keyhole</b> method utilizes a previously acquired a library of peripheral k-space datasets at similar displacement and phase (where phase is simply used to determine whether the breathing is inhale to exhale or exhale to inhale) respiratory bins in conjunction with central k-space datasets (<b>keyhole)</b> acquired. External respiratory signals drive the process of sorting, matching, and combining the two k-space streams for each respiratory bin, thereby achieving faster image acquisition without substantial motion artifacts. This study was the first that investigates the impact of k-space undersampling on lung tumor motion and area assessment across clinically available techniques (zero-filling and conventional <b>keyhole).</b> In this study, the dynamic <b>keyhole,</b> conventional <b>keyhole</b> and zero-filling methods were compared to full k-space dataset acquisition by quantifying (1) the <b>keyhole</b> size required for central k-space datasets for constant image quality across sixty four cine-MRI datasets from nine lung cancer patients, (2) the intensity difference between the original and reconstructed images in a constant <b>keyhole</b> size, and (3) the accuracy of tumor motion and area directly measured by tumor autocontouring. Results: For constant image quality, the dynamic <b>keyhole</b> method, conventional <b>keyhole,</b> and zerofilling methods required 22 %, 34 %, and 49 % of the <b>keyhole</b> size (P < 0. 0001), respectively, compared to the full k-space image acquisition method. Compared to the conventional <b>keyhole</b> and zero-filling reconstructed images with the <b>keyhole</b> size utilized in the dynamic <b>keyhole</b> method, an average intensity difference of the dynamic <b>keyhole</b> reconstructed images (P < 0. 0001) was minimal, and resulted in the accuracy of tumor motion within 99. 6 % (P < 0. 0001) and the accuracy of tumor area within 98. 0 % (P < 0. 0001) for lung tumor monitoring applications. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the dynamic <b>keyhole</b> method is a promising technique for clinical applications such as image-guided radiation therapy requiring the MR monitoring of thoracic tumors. Based on the results from this study, the dynamic <b>keyhole</b> method could increase the imaging frequency by up to a factor of five compared with full k-space methods for real-time lung tumor MRI...|$|R

Octavianus cannot kill enemies, {{he can only}} knock them out by hitting them from behind with objects such as vases, choking them with ropes or placing banana peels in front of them. Once he has done so, he often has to drag their body into hiding to make sure other enemies don't find it. Other ways to avoid enemies are by hiding in large pots, or by stealing clothes and impersonating guards or other people. During these levels, there is an alert gauge which appears when Octavianus is spotted by an enemy. The gauge gradually empties over time if {{he is out of}} sight, and once it is completely empty, enemies stop looking for him. Octavianus can also distract enemies by throwing items such as stones and by whistling. Even if Octavianus is disguised, enemies can become suspicious of him if he does anything unusual, such as running, standing still for no reason, or trying to open locked doors. Often, enemies will stop him and question him. The player will be presented with a series of choices to try to assuage the guards' suspicions.

Using systematically obtained <b>keyhole</b> data, how the <b>keyhole</b> dynamically responds to an incident laser beam was studied by defining several key factors, such as <b>keyhole</b> expansion factor, <b>keyhole</b> motion range factor, average aperture diameters, mass loss fraction and melt pool volume size.

When the beam irradiates on the front <b>keyhole</b> wall, the zinc evaporation region between the two sheets can be directly heated by the beam, and the zinc vapor pressure can become extremely large, and therefore the melt pool is severely disturbed. The <b>keyhole</b> bottom aperture diameter and the <b>keyhole</b> expansion factor for the bottom aperture were both largely proportional to the mass loss for both zinc-coated and uncoated steels. Zero-gap laser welding of zinc-coated steels can be indeed successful and a theoretical basis is presented. close...|$|R

40|$|In <b>keyhole</b> {{fiber laser}} welding processes, the weld pool {{behavior}} and <b>keyhole</b> dynamics {{are essential to}} determining welding quality. To observe and control the welding process, the accurate extraction of the weld pool boundary {{as well as the}} width is required. In addition, because of the cause-and-effect relationship between the welding defects and stability of the <b>keyhole,</b> which is primarily determined by <b>keyhole</b> geometry during the welding process, the stability of <b>keyhole</b> needs to be considered as well. ^ The first part of this thesis presents a weld pool edge detection technique based on an off axial green illumination laser and a coaxial image capturing system that consists of a CMOS camera and optic filters. According to the difference of image quality, a complete developed edge detection algorithm is proposed based on the local maximum gradient of grayness searching approach and linear interpolation. The extracted weld pool geometry and the width are validated by the actual welding width measurement and predictions by a numerical multi-phase model. ^ As for the <b>keyhole</b> dynamics, three essential attributes to describe the simplified three-dimensional <b>keyhole</b> shape include <b>keyhole</b> size, penetration depth and <b>keyhole</b> inclination angle. However, when using traditional measurement techniques, it is very challenging to take in-process measurements of penetration depth and inclination angle, even if the <b>keyhole</b> size can be detected by using a visual monitoring system. To realize the on-line estimation of <b>keyhole</b> dynamics and welding defects, a data-based radial basis function neural network state observer is adopted for estimating penetration depth and inclination angle in the transient state when welding parameters change suddenly. First, a static neural network is trained in advance to establish a correlation between the welding parameters and unobservable <b>keyhole</b> geometry. The dynamic state observer is trained based on the transient welding conditions predicted by a numerical model and then used to estimate the time-varying <b>keyhole</b> geometery. Meanwhile, the coaxial monitoring system is used to observe the <b>keyhole</b> shape from the top side in real time, which not only provides input to the neural network but also indicates the potential welding porosities. The predicted results are validated by experimental data performed by welding with stainless steel 304 and magnesium alloy AZ 31 B. ...|$|R
