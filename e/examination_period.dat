A new approach to further decreasing the number of student conflicts by allowing some exams to be split into multiple <b>examination</b> <b>periods</b> is also studied. ...|$|R

However, examinations of practical components, project work, in-plant training programs, etc. may be held before the semester-end <b>examination</b> <b>period</b> as decided by the department.|$|E

The online survey is opened to students from mid-semester {{to the end of the}} semester (beyond the <b>examinations</b> <b>period).</b> From the control and test groups, eleven and nine students filled the online survey in 2014 / 15 and 2015 / 16 respectively.|$|R
