50|$|The {{drum motor}} concept was first {{recorded}} in 1928 {{but was not}} realised until the early 1950s {{when it was first}} produced specifically for conveyor belt applications. The idea was to produce a compact, <b>totally</b> <b>enclosed</b> single component drive unit with high efficiency and lower frictional losses than a conventional geared motor. The new design was quick and easy to install, required no maintenance and because of its <b>totally</b> <b>enclosed</b> IP66 sealed design would be unaffected by dust, dirt grease or water. Today you see many examples of drum motor applications in airport check-in conveyors and security machines, supermarket checkstands, food processing conveyors and weighing equipment. Reversible drum motors are also used for roller shutter doors.|$|R
