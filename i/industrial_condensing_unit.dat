40|$|AbstractThe use of air-conditioning, {{the largest}} energy demand for {{buildings}} in the tropics, is increasing as regional population and affluence grow. The majority of installed systems are split type air-conditioners. While the performance of new equipment is much better, {{the influence of the}} microclimate where the <b>condensing</b> <b>units</b> are installed is often overlooked. Several studies have used CFD simulations to analyse the stack effect, a buoyancy-driven airflow induced by heat rejected from <b>condensing</b> <b>units.</b> This leads to higher on-coil temperatures, deteriorating the performance of the air-conditioners. We present the first field measurements from a 24 -storey building in Singapore. A network of wireless temperature sensors measured the temperature around the stack of <b>condensing</b> <b>units.</b> We found that the temperatures in the void space increased continuously along the height of the building by 10 – 13 °C, showing a significant stack effect from the rejected heat from <b>condensing</b> <b>units.</b> We also found that hot air gets stuck behind louvres, built as aesthetic barriers, which increases the temperature another 9 °C. Temperatures of around 50 °C at the inlet of the <b>condensing</b> <b>units</b> for floors 10 and above are the combined result, reducing the unit efficiency by 32 % compared to the undisturbed design case. This significant effect is completely neglected in building design and performance evaluation, and only with an integrated design process can truly efficient solutions be realised...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Recessed spaces outside {{high-rise}} {{residential buildings}} of public-type in Hong Kong often contain {{a large number}} of <b>condenser</b> <b>units</b> of window-type air-conditioners that during summer reject heat into this space at the same time. For four <b>condenser</b> <b>units</b> per story, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code is used to predict temperature and flow fields inside the recessed spaces that differ in heights and condenser-unit locations. The results show that a powerful rising hot air stream and one vortex pair are formed in the space near to its corner wall. In addition, the results show that <b>condenser</b> <b>units</b> will suffer more when they are placed inside the taller recessed space, and at locations higher at this space and nearer to its corner wall. Then, these units would draw less air at an elevated temperature, and therefore become less energy efficient and de-rated in output capacity and sometime have interrupted operation. However, the <b>condenser</b> <b>units</b> at lower levels may benefit because they will draw more air at nearly environmental temperature. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|A <b>condenser</b> <b>unit</b> used {{in central}} air {{conditioning}} systems typically has a heat exchanger section to cool down and condense incoming refrigerant vapor into liquid, a compressor to raise {{the pressure of the}} refrigerant and move it along, and a fan for blowing outside air through the heat exchanger section to cool the refrigerant inside. A typical configuration of such a <b>condenser</b> <b>unit</b> is as follows: The heat exchanger section wraps around the sides of the unit with the compressor inside. In this heat exchanger section, the refrigerant goes through multiple tube passes, which are surrounded by heat transfer fins through which cooling air can move from outside to inside the unit. There is a motorized fan inside the <b>condenser</b> <b>unit</b> near the top, which is covered by some grating to keep any objects from accidentally falling inside on the fan. The fan is used to blow the outside cooling air in through the heat exchange section at the sides and out the top through the grating. These <b>condenser</b> <b>units</b> are located {{on the outside of the}} building they are trying to cool, with tubing between the unit and building, one for vapor refrigerant entering and another for liquid refrigerant leaving the unit.

40|$|The use of {{split-type}} air-conditioners in {{new apartment}} buildings becomes popular in Hong Kong.
