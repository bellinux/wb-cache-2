40|$|Software is {{a unique}} process that draws on {{socially}} structured domain-knowledge as its central resource. This clarifies the importance of information and design in an informational environment, as well as signals the impact of <b>digital</b> <b>architectures</b> in structuring new patterns of social interaction. These informational patterns are embedded in software both technically and through the development process, resulting in a strong cohesion between production, product and industry structures. Software increasingly is a central, but hidden factor within the global environment structuring production practices, embedded in products and shaping social interactions. Many of the central conflicts, assumptions and patterns in information societies are directly linked to software’s informational practice or highlighted first through software focused debates. Ignoring such patterns directly limits our understanding {{and analysis of the}} broader social transformations in the global environment. Failing to recognize these processes limits the space for social debate, policy and action around the establishment and evolution of these new <b>digital</b> <b>architectures</b> at the locus of their development...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{a review}} of the major {{evolution}} steps of mobile transmitter architectures is summarized. We pro-pose a classification and discuss about improvements and evolutions towards the full-digital solutions. This discussion is mandatory while the cognitive-radio concept implies the design of new structures for multi-radio front-ends. Technologi-cal process improvements, for example CMOS for high frequency, opens new possible solutions thanks to digitally based buildings blocks and functions. The conception of fully <b>digital</b> <b>architectures</b> is discussed in that idea. Our work in this domain is presented as a contribution in the study of transmitter architecture for multi-radio. Two ways are explored: (1) improvements of analog and digitized <b>architectures,</b> and (2) <b>digital</b> <b>architectures.</b> We present, in these two fields, a state of the art of published works and patents [US 20130051440 A 1], [US 20130084816 A 1], [US 20120320957 A 1]. The Multi-radio context drives us to redefine the important figures of merit for the architecture design, as seen in recent publications and patents such as [US 20130049854 A 1], [US 20130009710 A 1], [US 8432219], [EP 2541781 A 1]. The traditional effi-ciency/linearity trade-off has to be considered with a mandatory frequency flexibility and power control ability, defined here as “power scale-ability”. These constraints made the conception of fully <b>digital</b> <b>architectures</b> attractive, thanks to the flexibility of digital systems. The first part of this paper will present the challenges of designing transmitter architectures for cellular and wireless local/extended area networks (WLAN and WIMAX for example), under the hypothesis of no...|$|R
