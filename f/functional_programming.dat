The model records the computation of a <b>functional</b> <b>program</b> in a graph which can be utilised for various purposes such as algorithmic debugging. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} to prove the correctness of algorithmic debugging for <b>functional</b> <b>programs</b> based on the model. Although algorithmic debugging for <b>functional</b> <b>programs</b> is implemented in several tracers such as Hat, the correctness has not been formally proved before. The difficulty of the proof is to find a suitable induction principle and a more general induction hypothesis. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFinitely typed <b>functional</b> <b>programs</b> are {{naturally}} classified by their levels. This syntactic classification of <b>functional</b> <b>programs</b> {{corresponds to a}} semantical classification: the higher the level of <b>functional</b> <b>programs,</b> the more functions they can compute. We call FL the language of finitely typed <b>functional</b> <b>programs.</b> The halting problem on finite interpretations is elementary recursive for every FL program, i. e. for every FL program P there is an elementary recursive procedure to decide for every finite interpretation I whether P halts on I. The well-known programming language ML is essentially FL, augmented with the polymorphic let-in constructor. We show that ML computes the same class of functions as FL. As a consequence...|$|R

40|$|To {{prove the}} {{termination}} of a <b>functional</b> <b>program</b> {{there has to be}} a well-founded ordering such that the arguments in each recursive call are smaller than the corresponding inputs. In this paper we present a procedure for automated termination proofs of <b>functional</b> <b>programs.</b> In contrast to previously presented methods a suited well-founded ordering does not have to be fixed in advance by the user, but can be synthesized automatically. For that purpose we use approaches developed in the area of term rewriting systems for the automated generation of suited well-founded term orderings. But unfortunately term orderings cannot be directly used for termination proofs of <b>functional</b> <b>programs</b> which call other algorithms in the arguments of their recursive calls. The reason is that while for {{the termination of}} term rewriting systems orderings between terms are needed, for <b>functional</b> <b>programs</b> we need orderings between objects of algebraic data types. Our method solves this problem and enables term orderings to be used for termination proofs of <b>functional</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a fully automatic technique for verifying properties of higher-order <b>functional</b> <b>programs.</b> <b>Functional</b> <b>programs</b> are modelled with term rewriting systems and tree automata {{are used to}} model reachable program states. From a tree automaton representing the initial state, {{it is possible to}} define a completion algorithm on tree automata for approximating the output set of the program to verify. We define a subclass of higher-order <b>functional</b> <b>programs</b> for which the completion is guaranteed to terminate. Furthermore, since precision of the completion is fixed by a set of equations, we also propose an algorithm to automatically generate sets of equations by iterative refinement. We present some experiments showing that the resulting verification technique is complementary and extends several state-of-the-art model-checking approaches for higher-order <b>functional</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{deforestation}} of a <b>functional</b> <b>program</b> is {{a transformation}} which {{gets rid of}} intermediate data structures constructions that appear when two functions are composed. The descriptional composition, initially introduced by Ganzinger and Giegerich, is a deforestation method dedicated to the composition of two attribute grammars. This article presents a new functional deforestation technique, called symbolic composition, based on the descriptional composition mechanism, but extending it. An automatic translation from a <b>functional</b> <b>program</b> into an equivalent attribute grammar allows symbolic composition to be applied, and then {{the result can be}} translated back into a <b>functional</b> <b>program</b> (for instance, using the Jonhsson's transformation).

40|$|The {{correlation}} between test coverage and test effectiveness {{is important to}} justify the use of coverage in practice. Existing results on imperative programs mostly show that test coverage predicates effectiveness.

We also consider two types of effectiveness: raw effectiveness and normalized effectiveness. Our results are twofold. (1) In general the findings on imperative programs still hold on <b>functional</b> <b>programs,</b> warranting the use of coverage in practice.
