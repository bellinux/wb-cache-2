5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The <b>igniters</b> are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E

5|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{and fuel}} preburners are welded to the hot-gas manifold. The fuel and oxidizer enter the preburners and are mixed so that efficient combustion can occur. The augmented spark igniter {{is a small}} combination chamber located {{in the center of}} the injector of each preburner. The two dual-redundant spark <b>igniters,</b> which are activated by the engine controller, are used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each preburner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is then self-sustaining. The preburners produce the fuel-rich hot gases that pass through the turbines to generate the power needed to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The oxidizer preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPOTP and to the oxidizer preburner pump. The fuel preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPFTP.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>igniters</b> in {{gas turbine}} {{applications}} are electrical spark <b>igniters,</b> similar to automotive spark plugs. The igniter {{needs to be}} in the combustion zone where the fuel and air are already mixed, but it needs to be far enough upstream so that it is not damaged by the combustion itself. Once the combustion is initially started by the igniter, it is self-sustaining and the igniter is no longer used. In can-annular and annular combustors (see Types of combustors below), the flame can propagate from one combustion zone to another, so <b>igniters</b> are not needed at each one. In some systems ignition-assist techniques are used. One such method is oxygen injection, where oxygen is fed to the ignition area, helping the fuel easily combust. This is particularly useful in some aircraft applications where the engine may have to restart at high altitude.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Micro-electro-mechanical system(MEMS) have {{recently}} seen their {{field of application}} extended to military. This is mainly {{due to the fact}} that MEMS technologies present a great to reduce the mass, cost, power consumption, while improving the reliability, performance and smartness. Application of MEMS technology, the micropyrotechnic <b>igniter</b> are produced. The principle is based on the integration of lead styphnate(LTNR) material within a micropyrotechnic <b>igniter,</b> which is produced by MEMS with 3 by 3 micro-igniter. Each <b>igniter</b> contains three parts(the <b>igniter</b> chip, silicon chamber, lead styphnate). One import point is the optimization of the <b>igniter</b> process obtaining Ni-Cr bridges with about 13 Ω, which is triggered by electrical power delivered to LTNR. The resistance of Ni-Cr bridges is used to sense the temperature on the LTNR which is in contact. The other one point is the optimization of silicon chamber process obtaining incorporate configuration of micropyrotechnic <b>igniter.</b> The ignition performance of micropyrotechnic <b>igniter</b> array are tested with ignition voltage less than 13 V.

40|$|Wireless <b>igniter</b> system (namely WISys in this research) is {{a modern}} type <b>igniter</b> system, which {{utilizes}} the concept of radio frequency (RF) communication between a transmitting device and a receiving device and also the usage of a specified designated <b>igniter.</b> This type of <b>igniter</b> system is now becoming the main focus in most rocketry industries, especially for small scale solid rocket motor (SRM). The main purpose of using a wireless <b>igniter</b> system is because it can provide secure feeling when conducting experiment and testing, {{especially when it comes}} to the matter of explosive materials. The main components that a wireless <b>igniter</b> system must have include a transmitter, a receiver and an <b>igniter.</b> In this research, both the transmitter and receiver were designed to be function able at various ranges and the maximum communication range must reach up to 100 meters. Therefore, selection for wireless communication module is very significant and here the XBee-S 1 Starter Kit from Cytron Technologies was used as the main wireless communication module. With its ability to communicate with another XBee-S 1 Starter Kit as far as 100 meters range and simplicity of performing configuration and synchronisation, the XBee-S 1 Starter Kit module is simply the best choice, especially for those who are unfamiliar with radio frequency communication. Moreover, the power supply for the ignition must be at least 12 V so that there is sufficient heating energy to ignite the pyrolant contained inside the <b>igniter</b> within 3 to 5 seconds. For a good <b>igniter,</b> the <b>igniter</b> must possess good characteristics, such as made from stainless steel, sustainable material, high melting point, able to withstand very high pressure and temperature, high resistance to rust, small size and portable, light weight and tough. So, <b>igniter</b> with these characteristics will be able to store enough pressure inside the combustion or primary chamber to achieve complete combustion of the pyrolant before it is forced out from the <b>igniter</b> into the thrust chamber of rocket motor to burn the propellant grains. As a conclusion, with high pressure inside the primary chamber the velocity inside the chamber would be low. Hence, the burning rate of the pyrolant would also be slower. With this condition achieved, the pyrolant inside the <b>igniter</b> could be burnt completely...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} {{and testing of}} an oxygen/methane torch ignition system {{as well as the}} evaluation process of the system are presented with the purpose of characterizing the properties and performance of methane as a fuel in a propulsion system. The experimental approach to this dissertation entails the {{development and}} testing of a swirl torch <b>igniter</b> under conditions that may be seen when feeding propellant from the main storage tanks: combinations of gaseous and liquid oxygen and methane. The experimental goal of this dissertation is to display the range of operability of the <b>igniter</b> technology presented leading to stable and consistent ignition. The interest on liquid oxygen/Methane as a propellant combination for rocket engine propulsion has been boosted due to recent developments in commercial space exploration, along with a desire to decrease the cost of space exploration technologies. Torch <b>igniter</b> requirements were met in this test campaign however issues with oxidizer condition were observed in {{the second phase of the}} torch <b>igniter</b> test campaign. The torch <b>igniter</b> design modification mitigated the issues encountered in the previous design iterations of the torch <b>igniter.</b> A total of 310 test runs were conducted in the torch <b>igniter</b> developmental test campaign. Steady state ignition was achieved in 276 out of 310 tests. Gas/gas propellants had a 100 % ignition rate while liquid/liquid propellants had a 66 % ignition rate. The propellant quality was plotted with the saturation curve to quantify the condition of the propellant that was fed to both successful and unsuccessful test runs. The objectives of this dissertation were successfully met as the swirl torch <b>igniter</b> was proven to resist and operate reliably in a rigorous duty cycle test.

2500|$|The first {{element is}} a {{fountain}} {{in the shape}} of a five-pointed star, [...] in height and set on the northern end of the site. The fountain is clad in a nearly black granite known as St. John's Black. Water in the basin overflows the sides of the fountain, and is collected in a small trough at the base of the structure. In the center of the fountain is an eternal flame. Jets below the surface of the water generate bubbles of natural gas, which rise to the surface.

2500|$|The third revised {{design was}} {{presented}} to the Commission of Fine Arts on July 17, 2008. Two firms had been hired by the memorial planners to assist the design team: Fluidity Design Consultants, which helped with the design of the star-shaped fountain; and Cloud Gehshan Associates, which worked on the glass panels and artworks. The first major change to the memorial design involved the star-shaped basin, which no longer overflowed into the triangular reflecting pool. Now the fountain overflowed itself, with water passing down its sides into a trough {{at the base of the}} structure. The overflow was designed to be a quiet one. The basin's underlying stone was no longer black granite, but the same grey granite as the rest of the plaza. The height of the star-shaped basin was also raised to [...] above the plaza, to make it a more visible and dramatic part of the memorial's design. (The height of the fountain permitted someone in a wheelchair to see the flame, but was also high enough to discourage a person from climbing into the water and approaching the flame.) The fountain was designed to be turned off in winter, although the basin would not be drained. A sensor system would detect if anyone climbed into the fountain's basin, and turn off the flame as a protective measure. The nature of the eternal flame had also been further refined. The new plan called for five stones to protrude slightly above the water. Just out of sight below the surface of the water, jets would allow natural gas to bubble to the surface. As the bubbles broke the surface, <b>igniters</b> hidden in the stones would cause the gas to burst into a [...] high flame. Sensors would adjust the flow of gas and the operation of the <b>igniters</b> to accommodate weather (such as wind or rain).|$|E
