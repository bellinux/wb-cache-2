2500|$|Differences {{between the}} North American Camry and the Scepter were few. While the North American {{versions}} received a revised V6 engine (1MZ-FE) in 1993, the Scepter {{used the same}} 3VZ-FE V6 over the entire model cycle. The Scepter headlamps were a wraparound design (1992–1994 models), utilising a dual-filament bulb along with integrated fog lights. Unlike the North American Camry, the 1992–1994 model taillamps did not include red reflectors or side markers. The Scepter also included an updated climate control unit with an LCD display in some models. Other differences include the [...] "Scepter" [...] trunk garnish, <b>fender</b> <b>marker</b> lights, some options, and interior trim.|$|E
50|$|The Soul Hamstar Edition, {{introduced}} in 2011, featured body colored bumpers, rear sport spoiler, black 18-inch wheels, black <b>fender</b> vents w/side <b>marker</b> repeater, rear bumper applique, matte alloy fuel door, hamstar exterior graphics, black leather seating, heated seats, hamstar edition floor mats, smart key push button starting, automatic climate control, fog lights, and leather {{steering wheel and}} shift knob.|$|R
5000|$|... 1968 models had {{reshaped}} {{front and}} rear loop-type bumpers that encased the vehicle's (recessed crosshatch) grille and tail lamps, respectively. Hidden wiper arms were also new. Federally mandated side marker lights were of an inverted trapezoidal shape on the lower leading edges of the front <b>fenders.</b> Rear <b>marker</b> lights were circular. The interior was restyled and, unlike the 1966-67 models, shared its instrument panel with the other full-size Buick models. Shoulder belts for front outboard occupants were made standard on all cars built from January 1, 1968. There were very few mechanical changes in 1968, but the transmission lost its variable pitch torque converter. A tilt steering wheel was standard. Sales set another new record in 1968, as 49,284 units were sold.|$|R
5000|$|At the rear, ribbed {{rectangular}} taillights were mounted inboard the Ambassadors rearward-thrusting rear <b>fenders.</b> Square ribbed <b>marker</b> {{lights of}} similar height were mounted at {{the trailing edge of}} each fender side. The deck lid had {{a slightly higher}} lift over. The base and DPL models had no decorative panel connecting the taillights while the top-line SST versions featured a panel painted red to match the taillights. Station wagons saw vertical wraparound taillights replacing the previous [...] "hooded" [...] units, which were not visible from the side. The 1969 AMC Ambassador was a smooth, powerful, well-proportioned sedan that did not look like anything else on the road.|$|R
5000|$|The {{downturn}} of the Mexican economy {{early in}} 1982 {{and a government}} decree banning the importation of [...] "luxury" [...] automotive accessories hit the country's auto industry. The 1982 VAM Gremlin returned as a slightly consolidated model. Both trim levels incorporated amber front parking lights and the AMC square pattern grille design {{that was used in}} U.S. domestic Eagle models. The base model incorporated chromed headlight bezels with blacked out internal areas while the X model were completely blacked out as also was the hood trim molding. The 258 CID L I6 was upgraded {{for the first time since}} 1976, receiving a higher 8.5:1 compression ratio and net output of [...] at 4000 rpm. The base model was similar to the prior year's except for new side trim and front end design. The X model saw the return of side decals the form of four thin stripes starting at the base of the B-pillar trim molding running all the way to the front edge of the <b>fenders</b> near the <b>marker</b> lights. A new silver [...] "GX" [...] decal appeared between the rear window and the right side tail light. The sports steering wheel was replaced by the base design. The model was available with a three-speed automatic transmission with the AMX/GT's console-type shifter and the rear differential remained at 3.07:1 as previously used with the four-speed manual.|$|R

The model was restricted to a three-speed automatic transmission with the novelty of the AMX/GT's console-type shifter boot and the rear differential changed to a [...] 3.07:1 ratio as used the year before with the now-unavailable four-speed manual.|$|R
