25|$|Tattooing {{involves}} {{the placement of}} pigment into the skin's dermis, the layer of <b>dermal</b> <b>tissue</b> underlying the epidermis. After initial injection, pigment is dispersed throughout a homogenized damaged layer down through the epidermis and upper dermis, in both of which the presence of foreign material activates the immune system's phagocytes to engulf the pigment particles. As healing proceeds, the damaged epidermis flakes away (eliminating surface pigment) while deeper in the skin granulation tissue forms, which is later converted to connective tissue by collagen growth. This mends the upper dermis, where pigment remains trapped within fibroblasts, ultimately concentrating in a layer just below the dermis/epidermis boundary. Its presence there is stable, {{but in the long}} term (decades) the pigment tends to migrate deeper into the dermis, accounting for the degraded detail of old tattoos.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Photosensitivity {{in animals}} {{is defined as}} a severe {{dermatitis}} that results from a heightened reactivity of skin cells and associated <b>dermal</b> <b>tissues</b> upon their exposure to sunlight, following ingestion or contact with UV reactive secondary plant products. Photosensitivity occurs in animal cells as a reaction that is mediated by a light absorbing molecule, specifically in this case a plant-produced metabolite that is heterocyclic or polyphenolic. In sensitive animals, this reaction is most severe in non-pigmented skin which has the least protection from UV or visible light exposure. Photosensitization in a biological system such as the epidermis is an oxidative or other chemical change in a molecule in response to light-induced excitation of endogenous or exogenously-delivered molecules within the tissue. Photo-oxidation can also occur in the plant itself, resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species, free radical damage and eventual DNA degradation. Similar cellular changes occur in affected herbivores and are associated with an accumulation of photodynamic molecules in the affected <b>dermal</b> <b>tissues</b> or circulatory system of the herbivore.

5000|$|Scarring during healing {{can create}} both {{physical}} and psychological problems, and is a significant clinical burden {{which is why the}} scar free healing concept is of interest. Some of the problems in scar healing lie in the physical outcome of the process: for example when collagen is abnormally organised in scar tissue. In scars the collagen is arranged in parallel bundles of the collagen fibres whilst healthy scar free tissue has a [...] "basket weave" [...] structure (Figure 1). The difference in collagen arrangement along with a lack of difference in the <b>dermal</b> <b>tissue</b> when healing has taken place with or without scarring is indicative of regenerative failure of normal skin. Severe scarring resulting from these collagen deposits is known as hypertrophic scarring and is of great concern worldwide with an incidence ranging from 32-72%.|$|E

Six treatments were conducted on a 7- to 10-day interval to determine whether antioxidant levels could be increased in the skin and skin quality improved with this technique. Results of this study demonstrated that hydradermabraded skin possessed increased epidermal and papillary dermal thickness as well as greater antioxidant levels.

50|$|Upon {{microbial}} infection, PMNs {{move out}} from the bloodstream through the vessels’ endothelial layer, {{to the site of}} the infected tissue (<b>dermal</b> <b>tissue</b> after fly bite). They immediately initiate the first immune response and phagocytize the invader by recognition of foreign and activating surfaces on the parasite. Activated PMN secrete chemokines, IL-8 particularly, to attract further granulocytes and stimulate phagocytosis. Further, L. major increases the secretion of IL-8 by PMNs. This mechanism is observed during infection with other obligate intracellular parasites, as well. For microbes like these, multiple intracellular survival mechanisms exist. Surprisingly, the coinjection of apoptotic and viable pathogens causes by far a more fulminate course of disease than injection of only viable parasites. When the anti-inflammatory signal phosphatidylserine usually found on apoptotic cells, is exposed on the surface of dead parasites, L. major switches off the oxidative burst, thereby preventing killing and degradation of the viable pathogen.|$|E

On the dorsal surface of young monitors, there are a series of yellow spots with dark transverse bars connecting them. As they mature, the ground colour becomes light brown or grey, and dark spots give them a speckled appearance.

The nares can be closed at will, especially to keep away debris or water. The scales of the skin are rougher in patches and on the sides, they have minute pits, especially well distributed in males. These scales with micropores have glandular structures in the underlying <b>dermal</b> <b>tissue</b> and produce a secretion which may be a pheromone-like substance. Like other varanids, Bengal monitors have a forked tongue that is protruded in the manner of snakes. The function is mainly sensory, and is not very involved in the transport of food down the throat.
