40|$|Flow {{distribution}} chambers are devices {{commonly used}} by the water industry to distribute flows in water and sewage treatment plants. These have simple designs, and are required to operate over a range of volumetric flowrates. Many chambers surveyed (Herbath and Wong, 1997 b) were found to perform poorly. They suffered from flow mal-distribution, where the flow was not distributed according to design. The {{most common cause of}} flow mal-distribution was hypothesised to be due to the presence of a pipe bend below the chamber (Herbath and Wong, 1997 a, 1997 b). Therefore, an experimental and numerical study of the flow within a <b>distribution</b> <b>chamber</b> was conducted in this thesis to prove this hypothesis. A novel large-scale model (1 : 13) of a typical <b>distribution</b> <b>chamber</b> was constructed. This allowed the collection of high quality and novel velocity and turbulence measurements near the free surface using hot film anemometry. The free surface location was measured using a vernier point gauge while the flow distribution between the outlets was metered by orifice plates. Records of the flow patterns were also kept. The experimental results showed that flow mal-distribution did not occur as expected since the model <b>distribution</b> <b>chamber</b> was designed with a long length of straight inlet pipe, to eliminate the suspected cause of flow mal-distribution. Novel velocity and water surface data were also collected in the experiments, which contributed towards the small body of knowledge in this area of research into flow distribution. CFD models of the physical model were created and solved using a commercial CFD code, CFX 4. 1, developed by CFX International of AEA Technology. Steady state and transient two- and three-dimensional calculations of the symmetrical chamber were carried out {{in the course of the}} study. A novel adaptation of the existing code was made in obtaining solutions to the numerical models. A new solution strategy was made and refined in this stage of the research using the two-dimensional representation of the <b>distribution</b> <b>chamber,</b> for reasons of reduced computational time. Differencing schemes, surface sharpening, mass residuals, mesh refinement and different turbulence models were investigated during model refinement. The accuracies of the calculated results were determined by comparison with experimental results. It was found that the 3 D model, incorporating the RNG k-c model, without surface sharpening, and using the Van Leer differencing scheme, gave good quantitative agreement with the experimental velocities, free surface location and flow distribution. The 2 D results gave qualitatively good predictions. Quantitatively, the results were over-predicted which was due, to dimensional effects. The volume of the 2 D model was reduced from the 3 D model, while the inlet velocity was made the same. This replicated the momentum effects near the free surface that were the governing causes of flow mal-distribution. Nevertheless, this approach was much more practical in terms of computational effort. More importantly, the correct trends for flow mal-distribution could be predicted accurately. Therefore, the next stage of the research used the 2 D model developed and validated here. This part of the research involved the novel adaptation of the existing symmetrical 2 D results for investigating the asymmetric effects of pipe bends. Three different approaches for modelling the asymmetric effects of a pipe bend were investigated. The first, and the most simplistic, was to incline the incoming flow at an angle to the vertical. The second was to calculate the velocities and turbulence at the outlet of a simple 2 D pipe bend, separate from the chamber. These calculated variables were then input into the chamber, to build up a picture of the asymmetric flow, iteratively. The third, and the most accurate method, was to couple the bend to the chamber. It was found that only the third method was capable of accurately representing the conditions within the chamber. Two different pipe bend. lengths were examined using the third approach. The distances chosen were typical of the bend distances found in some treatment plants. The results. from both simulations produced large flow mal-distribution and asymmetric flows within the chamber. A value of 10 % difference between the flows from the two outlets was taken to be the maximum limit for mal-distribution. However, values of 44. 5 % and 22. 8 % were obtained for the larger pipe distance and short pipe distance respectively. Novel remediation strategies using numerical techniques were used to determine the most effective means of improving the flow distribution. The first, used a vertical flow splitter, placed directly above the chamber inlet. Although it altered the path of the jet, it was felt that it would be ineffective for all situations. Although the magnitude of the asymmetry was improved with the use of the splitter, the improvement was insufficient to warrant its recommendation. The other device tested was a horizontal plate located at a certain distance from the chamber inlet. For the longer bend case, a separation distance equivalent to two inlet hydraulic diameters was sufficient to deflect the jet, and reduced the magnitude of the flow asymmetry to around 2 %. When the same plate location was used for the shorter bend case, the efficiency of the plate was reduced. Although there was an improvement in the distribution, the magnitude of the asymmetry was greater than 10 %. The plate was subsequently lowered by half a hydraulic diameter. This gave a large improvement to the effectiveness of the plate, and the resulting asymmetry was reduced to 7. 31 %. The horizontal plate was considered more promising since its function was to deflect and reduce the peak velocities of the jet. With the reduction in velocities, the magnitudes of the nonlinear terms in the Navier-Stokes equations are reduced. The solution to the equations would be more likely to be symmetrical...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Fine {{particle}} processing {{has long}} been a challenge in the minerals processing industry. Ores often have to be ground to less than 100 μm in size in order to liberate the valuable components. Even in the coal industry, where there is minimal comminution, a considerable fraction of the run-of-mine coal is less than 100 μm in size. Hence, {{it can be difficult to}} efficiently recover these fine particles using existing beneficiation methods, such as flotation. In the past few decades, there has been on-going effort focussed on developing methods to separate finer particles in an efficient way, with an increasing interest in approaches that involve dry particles. This Thesis is concerned with the potential for achieving selective separations through contacting particles with water drops. More specifically, the objective was to achieve selective capture of the hydrophilic particles via the water phase, leaving the hydrophobic particles in a dry state. Two different approaches were investigated through the establishment of novel experimental systems. The first approach involved a system consisting of falling water drops passing through a gas-suspension of particles. Conceptually, this approach is the opposite of conventional flotation. A gaseous dispersion of particles was used instead of a water based dispersion of particles, and a system of falling water drops was used instead of a system of rising air bubbles. Thus the particles travelled horizontally with the airflow, colliding with drops via the gas side of the gas-liquid interface of the falling drops. The hydrophobic particles either adhered at the surface or were deflected, while the hydrophilic particles were engulfed completely, settling through to the base of the drop. Ideally the hydrophobic particles passed through the collection zone, reporting in a dry form. Thus, in the context of the coal industry, a high calorific dry product should be generated. Due to the low viscosity of air compared to water, the collision efficiency of the particles with the water drops should increase significantly compared to conventional flotation. Thus viscous forces become far less significant, allowing the inertial forces to dominate, even for ultrafine particles. Energy consumption should then be much lower. A new laboratory-scale experimental system was then designed and set up to further investigate this approach. The development of this facility represented a major outcome of the study, the goal being to control the steady flow of the particles and the drops to achieve reproducible and meaningful data sets. A number of design modifications were needed to achieve these requirements. The experimental system consisted of a feed column, water <b>distribution</b> <b>chamber</b> mounted over a collision chamber, underflow collection system, and dry particle cyclone stage. The airflow was driven by an air suction pump. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles covering a broad size range (8 - 116 μm) and spherical and irregular shapes were used in the experimental program to investigate the selective collection efficiency of this system. Results, expressed in terms of the recovery to underflow, were found to be highly reproducible, to within 3 %. A simple mathematical model was also developed to describe the interception of the particles with the water drops. Particles were assumed to be collected if there was any overlap in the trajectories of the particles and the drops. In one version, the particle velocity was assumed to be much higher than the falling speed of the drops, while in a second version the particle velocity was assumed to be much smaller than the drop speed. These models were then validated using the Discrete Element Method, demonstrating the accuracy of the model in these two extremes. Moreover, the DEM approach allowed intermediate, less extreme, conditions to be examined. Thus the modelling approach provided an appreciation of the principle parameters governing the interception, most notably the water flux, droplet diameter, and active length of the collection zone. Clearly, the model did not consider the subtle effects associated with the particle-drop adhesion, dynamic wetting, disengagement from the fluid streamlines, and particle shape effects. These more subtle effects were manifested through the experimental work. The recovery of the particles in the underflow was calculated relative to the total feed that passed through the experimental system. There was a linear dependence between the particle recovery in the underflow and the water flux, with a slope dependent on the relative selectivity between the different particle species. The analysis was examined using a water flux of up to 0. 0167 m 3 /(m 2 s). The results agreed well with the analytical and DEM models within the aforementioned water flux range. With the second approach, electrostatic formation of liquid marbles was investigated as an alternative mechanism for collecting hydrophilic glass ballotini particles into a water drop. In these experiments curious electrostatic phenomena were observed, resulting in the formation of particle agglomerates. Fine hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles on a charged substrate were seen to intermittently jump across a gap of several millimetres to penetrate the surface of a hanging water drop. The substrate was wrapped in Teflon (PTFE) tape, which provided an ideal substrate for frictional charging. Within around 300 milliseconds, the drop filled up like a 'sack of marbles'. Charge and volume data analysis of these experiments revealed that there is a tendency of the particles to jump to the drop intermittently in sudden 'cascades' or 'avalanches', rather than through gradual and incremental transfer as the substrate was moved toward the hanging drop. Although the distance between the substrate and the drop was important in affecting particle lift, the substrate speed had relatively little effect on the onset of the particle ‘avalanche’. This interesting phenomenon was also observed using different organic liquids such as glycerine and hexane. Overall, it was apparent that a limited selectivity between hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles can be achieved through direct interaction between a gaseous dispersion of the particles and a system of water drops. However, the level of selectivity was deemed to be insufficient for justifying the development of a successful industrial separation. The data sets generated from this work can be useful in any follow-up work in improving our understanding of the precise particle-drop interception, and final interaction. Electrostatic forces were clearly powerful across significant distances, and offered the potential for developing innovative methods for processing fine, dry particles. This approach may also prove useful in the formation of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic liquid marbles...|$|E

Colonies excavate and occupy a new nest about once a year, and doing so requires that they have information about the depth below ground.

Colonies essentially built a replicate of the just-vacated nest (although details differed), and they did so in less than a week. The reason for nest relocation is not apparent.

To test this hypothesis, the carbon dioxide gradient of colonies that were just beginning to excavate a new nest was eliminated by boring 6 vent holes around the forming nest, allowing the soil CO 2 to diffuse into the atmosphere and eliminating the gradient. Sadly, neither the nest architecture nor the vertical ant distribution of vented nests differed from either unvented control or from their own vacated nest.

This chapter focuses on the design and characterization of environmental chambers, including: (1) radiation conditions; (2) chamber mixing state; (3) chemical blank experiments; (4) free radical generation (principally the hydroxyl (OH) radical); (5) high-versus-low-NO conditions that govern the nature of VOC oxidation chemistry; (6) deposition of particles onto chamber walls; (7) deposition of organic vapors onto chamber walls; and (8) determination of the yield of SOA. Comparison of the design and behavior of the different types of reactor is addressed in detail. The performance of the differential mobility analyzer (DMA), the prime instrument for measuring aerosol size <b>distributions</b> in <b>chambers,</b> is addressed...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{airborne}} particle counting sensor (LAPCS), based on light scattering of particle, is specially used in clean environment monitoring. LAPCS samples {{the air by}} a pump, and uses a laser illuminating the sampled air in the chamber, then counts {{the total number of}} scattering signal and its amplitude distribution, which can characterize the number of particles and size distribution. The structure of air-flow-path in LAPCS directly influences the flow of sampling air, the particle trajectories and velocity <b>distribution</b> in <b>chamber</b> that will influence the performance of LAPCS. In this paper, a finite element arithmetic based on Ansys Fluent 14 software environment was developed to simulate the air flow and particle flow in LAPCS. Based on numerical calculations, velocity distribution of airflow and particle trajectories in chamber of LAPCS with different nozzles are presented intuitively. A few particles probably are disturbed outside the air-flow path and pass the photosensitive area many times, which can make the LAPCS iteration count. The results can provide a theoretical basis for optimizing design of the LAPCS...|$|R
