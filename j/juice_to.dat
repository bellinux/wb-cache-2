5|$|Arak is a Levantine {{alcoholic}} spirit (~40–63% Alc. Vol./~80–126 proof) {{from the}} anis drinks family, common in Israel {{and throughout the}} Middle East. It is a clear, colorless, unsweetened anise-flavored distilled alcoholic drink (also labeled as an Apéritif). It is often served neat or mixed with ice and water, which creates a reaction turning the liquor a milky-white colour. It is sometimes also mixed with grapefruit <b>juice</b> <b>to</b> create a cocktail known as 'Arak eshkoliyyot', literally 'Arak grapefruit'.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{appear in}} {{folklore}} and traditional medicine around the world. Some cultures associate millipede activity with coming rains. In the Yoruba culture of Nigeria, millipedes {{are used in}} pregnancy and business rituals, and crushed millipedes are used to treat fever, whitlow, and convulsion in children. In Zambia, smashed millipede pulp is used to treat wounds, and the Bafia people of Cameroon use millipede <b>juice</b> <b>to</b> treat earache. In certain Himalayan Bhotiya tribes, dry millipede smoke is used to treat haemorrhoids. Native people in Malaysia use millipede secretions in poison-tipped arrows. The secretions of Spirobolus bungii have been observed to inhibit division of human cancer cells. The only recorded usage of millipedes as food by humans comes from the Bobo people of Burkina Faso, who consume boiled, dried millipedes in tomato sauce.|$|E

25|$|The Bellini {{consists}} of puréed white peaches and Prosecco, an Italian sparkling wine. Marinating fresh peaches in wine is an Italian tradition.

25|$|The {{provisional}} tolerable {{daily intake}} (PTDI) for patulin was set at 0.43µg/kg bw by the FDA based on a NOAEL of 0.3mg/kg bw per week.

However, the concentration in children 1–2 years old would be 3 {{times higher than the}} PDTI. Hence, an action limit of 50µg/kg was set.|$|E

Wolf spiders have since been exonerated—they never caused illness.|$|E
25|$|Wine is an {{integral}} part of Jewish laws and traditions. The Kiddush is a blessing recited over wine or grape <b>juice</b> <b>to</b> sanctify the Shabbat.

In the Tabernacle and in the Temple in Jerusalem, the libation of wine was part of the sacrificial service. Note that this does not mean that wine is a symbol of blood, a common misconception that contributes to the Christian myth of the blood libel.|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this research were to increase vitality of white shrimp postlarvae during adaptation time to salinity decrease {{with the addition of}} papaya <b>juice,</b> and <b>to</b> assess the physical and chemical properties of water during their adaptation. The research was conducted in October 2011 at the Laboratory of Aquaculture, Aquaculture Study Program, Faculty of Agriculture, Sriwijaya University. The research used a completely randomized design in order to evaluate the effect of a various papaya juice concentration. The concentrations used were without papaya juice addition (P 0), addition of papaya <b>juice</b> equivalent <b>to</b> 15 ppm K+ (P 1), addition of papaya <b>juice</b> equivalent <b>to</b> 30 ppm K+ (P 2), addition of papaya <b>juice</b> equivalent <b>to</b> 45 ppm K+ (P 3), and addition of papaya <b>juice</b> equivalent <b>to</b> 60 ppm K+ (P 4). Each treatment was repeated 3 times. The results of this current study showed that the addition of papaya <b>juice</b> equivalent <b>to</b> 15 ppm (P 1) in media that used to decrease salinity was concluded as the best treatment, and gave the survival rate of 65. 56 %, glucose level of 156. 67 mg. dL- 1 and oxygen consumption rate of 4. 807 mg O 2. g- 1. hour- 1.

25|$|Southern Thailand {{has its own}} sour curry, {{which is}} locally called kaeng som, but {{in the rest of}} Thailand is called kaeng lueang ("yellow curry") or kaeng som phak tai ("southern Thai kaeng som") to {{differentiate}} it from the central Thai kaeng som. It differs from the central Thai dish through its use of tamarind paste, assam fruit (som kaek) and lime <b>juice</b> <b>to</b> achieve the sourness, turmeric, which gives it a yellow color, garlic, shallots. The main characteristics of the southern variant is the use of turmeric and that it very spicy, sour and salty.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Harden and William Young {{along with}} Nick Sheppard determined, {{in a second}} experiment, that a {{heat-sensitive}} high-molecular-weight subcellular fraction (the enzymes) and a heat-insensitive low-molecular-weight cytoplasm fraction (ADP, ATP and NAD+ and other cofactors) are required together for fermentation to proceed. This experiment begun by observing that dialyzed (purified) yeast juice could not ferment or even create a sugar phosphate. This mixture was rescued {{with the addition of}} undialyzed yeast extract that had been boiled. Boiling the yeast extract renders all proteins inactive (as it denatures them). The ability of boiled extract plus dialyzed <b>juice</b> <b>to</b> complete fermentation suggests that the cofactors were non-protein in character.|$|E
25|$|Screw press- Grapes {{are loaded}} into an input where a large helical screw {{transfers}} the grape across perforated cylinder {{that allows the}} release <b>juice</b> <b>to</b> escape. As screw moves further down, the cake pomace is subjected to increasing pressure. While the advantage is the high throughput, the harsh pressing and lots of movement causes substantial tearing and grinding of the grape skins and seeds. This causes more minerals (such as potassium, which can affect pH), tannins and natural gums to be extracted into the juice. As much as 4% v/v of the pressed juice from a screw press could be suspended solids that {{may need to be}} treated by clarification and fining agents to be stable and filterable.|$|E
