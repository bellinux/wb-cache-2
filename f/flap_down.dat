25|$|During the dermal closure, the nipple-areola {{complex is}} {{transposed}} {{to its new}} locale, {{as determined by the}} skin pedicle. To create the curvilinear scar, the deep dermal closure is accomplished by rotating the lateral <b>flap</b> <b>down</b> and then medially. The deep dermis is approximated (joined) with sutures, in a simple, interrupted fashion. The key suture is emplaced at the junction where the apex of the vertical incision meets the nipple-areola complex—because it is the skin area of the breast subject to the greatest tension(s). The subcutaneous dermal closure is effected with interrupted sutures. As required, the final adjustments before suturing the skin closed, might include either micro-liposuction or additional de-epithelialization. After the dermal closure, a suture is emplaced to achieve the continuous approximation of the nipple-areola complex to the adjacent skin edge, and to the lower skin incisions.|$|E
500|$|On 17 September 1950 {{a pair of}} Grumman F9F-2 Panthers {{launched}} from the deck of [...] Philippine Sea. VF-112 Ensign Edward D. Jackson Jr. was leading a section [...] dispatched to strafe an airfield near North Korea's capital, Pyongyang. Flying on his wing was Ensign Dayl E. Crow. The airfield {{turned out to be}} little more than a grass strip littered with burned and shattered Soviet-built war machines. After strafing a locomotive and setting it ablaze, the jets turned north and started down the Han River. Soon, Jackson spotted about 75 river boats. When they starting receiving small arms fire from [...] "passengers" [...] on the vessels, Crow followed Jackson down as they made a low strafing pass, splintering many of the small craft with 20mm cannon fire. After the pass both attackers started to climb from [...] AGL. Jackson then flew through an aerial booby trap: steel cables strung across the Han to [...] "clothesline" [...] low flying planes. The Panther ripped through the cables like twine, but the whipsawing cable strands caught the starboard wing, shredded the wingtip tank and snapped across the canopy, punching out the windscreen and side windows. The impact knocked Jackson unconscious with severe facial injuries. Crow, flying just astern noticed something wrong, then saw the crushed wing tank and shattered canopy, its inner surface misted with blood. After 20 seconds Jackson regained consciousness and found himself blinded by shards of Plexiglas and blood. Crow was able to guide his leader towards the Yellow Sea, but Jackson was fading in and out of consciousness. With only the left <b>flap</b> <b>down</b> due to damage to the right wing the Panther approached the ship {{and with the help of}} LSO Lt.j.g."Les" [...] Bruestle and Crow the blind pilot trapped the #4 wire on the first attempt. Jackson survived with 36 stitches and an emergency blood transfusion.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{problems}} were encountered during early carrier trials. The combination of an aft cockpit and the Corsair's long nose made landings hazardous for newly trained pilots. During landing approaches {{it was found}} that oil from the hydraulic cowl flaps could spatter onto the windscreen, badly reducing visibility, and the undercarriage oleo struts had bad rebound characteristics on landing, allowing the aircraft to bounce out of control down the carrier deck. The first problem was solved by locking the top cowl <b>flap</b> <b>down</b> permanently, then replacing it with a fixed panel. The undercarriage bounce took more time to solve but eventually a [...] "bleed valve" [...] incorporated in the legs allowed the hydraulic pressure to be released gradually as the aircraft landed. The Corsair was not considered fit for carrier use until the wing stall problems and the deck bounce could be solved.|$|E

60|$|Nowhere in Political Mechanics have I {{seen such}} a Problem as this of {{hoisting}} to their feet the heavy-bottomed Dutch. The cunningest leverage, every sort of Diplomatic block-and-tackle, Carteret and Stair themselves running over to help in critical seasons, is applied; to almost no purpose.

Without them his Britannic Majesty durst not venture. Hidden in those dust-bins, there is nothing so absurd, or which would be so wearisome, did it not at last become slightly ludicrous, as this of hoisting the Dutch.|$|E

60|$|At {{the end of}} that time--and none {{knew who}} had started it--a rumour went through the Jungle that there was better food and water to be found in such and such a valley. The pig--who, of course, will go {{to the ends of the}} earth for a full meal--moved first by companies, scuffling over the rocks, and the deer followed, with the small wild foxes that live on the dead and dying of the herds; and the heavy-shouldered nilghai moved {{parallel}} with the deer, and the wild buffaloes of the swamps came after the nilghai. The least little thing would have turned the scattered, straggling droves that grazed and sauntered and drank and grazed again; but whenever there was an alarm some one would rise up and soothe them. At one time it would be Ikki the Porcupine, full of news of good feed just a little farther on; at another Mang would cry cheerily and <b>flap</b> <b>down</b> a glade to show it was all empty; or Baloo, his mouth full of roots, would shamble alongside a wavering line and half frighten, half romp it clumsily back to the proper road. Very many creatures broke back or ran away or lost interest, but very many were left to go forward. At the end of another ten days or so the situation was this. The deer and the pig and the nilghai were milling round and round in a circle of eight or ten miles radius, while the Eaters of Flesh skirmished round its edge. And the centre of that circle was the village, and round the village the crops were ripening, and in the crops sat men on what they call machans--platforms like pigeon-perches, made of sticks at the top of four poles--to scare away birds and other stealers. Then the deer were coaxed no more. The Eaters of Flesh were close behind them, and forced them forward and inward.|$|E
