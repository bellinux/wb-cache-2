5|$|Epilepsy {{occurs in}} a number of other animals {{including}} dogs and cats and is the most common brain disorder in dogs. It is typically treated with anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital or bromide in dogs and phenobarbital in cats. Imepitoin is also used in dogs. While generalized seizures in horses are <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> diagnose, it may be more difficult in non-generalized seizures and EEGs may be useful.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> grow {{in areas}} with a Mediterranean climate, but does not do well {{in areas with}} high summer humidity. It {{requires}} a sunny position in well-drained soil, and tolerates at least moderate frost. It should be pruned lightly, not below the green foliage, as it tends to become straggly with age otherwise. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 21 to 35 days to germinate.|$|E
50|$|It is {{considered}} a <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> plant <b>to</b> cultivate. It can be grown in well drained, loamy soil in full sun. It is better grown in an Alpine house or bulb frame.|$|R

5|$|The {{boundary}} line was nonetheless still <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> cross. Local inhabitants {{were able to}} maintain fields on the other side, or even to live {{on one side and}} work on the other. Refugees were able to sneak across or bribe the guards, and the smuggling of goods in both directions was rife. The flow of emigrants remained large despite the increase in East German security measures: 675,000people fled to West Germany between 1949 and 1952.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant is}} <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> grow in a {{mediterranean}} climate with good drainage {{and a light}} (sandy) soil; however, with medium to high susceptibility to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, it is unreliable in conditions that favour {{the growth of the}} soil-borne water mould, such as summer humidity or poor drainage. The use of phosphite fungicides does reduce the spread of Phytophthora. It generally does poorly in eastern Australia, although it is grown commercially in southeastern South Australia as a cut flower crop. It is also grown in California and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} star compass describes 32 points at which key stars rise {{on the eastern}} horizon and set on the western horizon. North latitude is <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> determine because the North Pole has a zenith star easily seen with the naked eye, called Polaris (Wuliwulifasmughet). Polaris' height above the horizon indicates the viewer's southward displacement from Polaris' nadir, he North Pole. When one travels further north, Polaris appears higher in the sky. Only at the true north pole is Polaris directly overhead at nearly 90 degrees altitude. When one travels south toward the equator, Polaris appears to descend toward the northern horizon. At 45 degrees north latitude, Polaris is 45 degrees above the northern horizon. Near the equator, Polaris' altitude approaches zero degrees, but for the viewer just further south, Polaris will have disappeared below the northern horizon.|$|E
50|$|Lying in the sparsely {{populated}} commune of Spital am Semmering, Stuhleck is a grassy mountain with gentle slopes, although its lower slopes are heavily wooded. With the summit being above the treeline, it offers fine views {{of some of}} the higher alpine ranges to the west, and it is a <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> hike <b>to</b> the top.|$|R
50|$|Determining {{longitude}} on {{land was}} <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> compared <b>to</b> {{the task at}} sea. A stable surface to work from, a comfortable location to live in while performing the work {{and the ability to}} repeat determinations over time made for great accuracy. Whatever could be discovered from solving the problem at sea would only improve the determination of longitude on land.|$|R
50|$|Pteris tremula is a <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> plant <b>to</b> grow in {{the home}} garden, where it prefers a shady spot. It prefers fair {{drainage}} with some moisture retention in the soil and filtered morning light. It is nevertheless fast growing and {{has been known to}} naturalise. In the 1950s it was reported to be the most commonly cultivated Pteris species in the United States of America.|$|R
5|$|Ayutthaya sat on {{an island}} {{surrounded}} by three rivers—the Lopburi River to the north, the Chao Phraya River {{to the west and}} south, and the Pa Sak River to the east, forming a formidable natural moat. The Chao Phraya basin where Ayutthaya is situated was low and prone to flooding—especially intense during the rainy season when torrential waters flowed in great quantity from the north along the Lopburi River. This flood would begin approximately in July and end somewhere between October and November, giving Tabinshwehti only five months to capture Ayutthaya—otherwise his camp grounds and supply routes would be flooded. There was also the possibility that the flood could trap his forces. The low, swampy area around the city was laced with numerous canals thronging with gun boats armed with cannon to repulse any attempt at an attack on the city. Also, the Burmese had only small cannon that they had brought with them, while the Siamese had large cannon mounted along the city walls. The Burmese had the city surrounded, but without the ability to cross the rivers or breach the city walls with cannon fire, were left to camp around it instead, while the interconnected waterways to the north and south made it <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> resupply the defenders in the city. Fifty Portuguese mercenaries, who had elected Galeote Pereira as their captain, defended the weakest part of the city wall for Maha Chakkraphat. Unable to take the city conventionally, Tabinshwehti offered bribes to these defenders. The Portuguese reacted with derision, and refused. When a Siamese commander heard of this, he swung open the gates of the city and dared the Burmese King to bring the money—a dare that was ignored.|$|E

25|$|The {{boundary}} line was nonetheless still <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> cross. Local inhabitants could cross to maintain fields {{on the other}} side, or even to live {{on one side and}} work on the other. Those who were unable to obtain passes could usually bribe the border guards or sneak across. Refugees from the east, many of them Germans expelled from other countries in central and eastern Europe, were guided across the boundary by villagers in exchange for hefty fees. Other locals on both sides smuggled goods across to supplement their meagre incomes. The number of border migrants remained high despite the increase in East German security measures; 675,000people fled to West Germany between 1949 and 1952.|$|E
25|$|Canadian Eskimo Dogs need a {{very large}} amount of exercise. They cannot just be walked, they need higher {{intensity}} work, requiring more exercise than many dog owners can give. This need for work and stimulation makes them well-suited for dog sports, such as carting, mushing, and skijoring. They are very trainable and submissive, unlike many spitz breeds, as well as intelligent. The Canadian Eskimo Dog is best kept in a cold climate, and is prone to heatstroke. Its coat is <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> care for most times of the year, needing brushing {{only one or two}} times a week. However, when it sheds (which happens once a year) it will need grooming every day.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the process}} of {{clinical}} diagnosis begins and myiasis is recognised, the larvae are <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> identify. Their overall body structure resembles the spiraled screw shape on which their common name is based, a shape fairly unusual within parasitic larvae. The cranial end of the larvae has two sharply curved hooks, generally dark in color, and distinctive spiracle patterns are observed at the caudal end. The most identifying features, and {{the easiest way to}} differentiate between C. hominivorax and C. macellaria, are the prominent darkened tracheal tubes which are visible in the final third of the larval body of the former, and are often visible both with a microscope and to the naked eye.|$|E
50|$|Voice pattern - This {{a form of}} {{authentication}} {{uses the}} unique pattern of a user’s voice. it relies on voice-to-print technologies, not voice recognition. In this process, a persons voice is transformed into text and compared to an original template. Although this is <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> technology <b>to</b> implement because many computers already have built-in microphones, the enrollment procedure {{is more complicated than}} other biometrics, and background noise can interfere with the scanning, which can be frustrating to the user.|$|R
25|$|Another {{reason for}} its {{popularity}} {{is that it}} is <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> and inexpensive <b>to</b> acquire a used boat and gear due to the large number of boats produced. There are 136 active fleets in the US alone, which offer a lot of race competition. This makes the J/24 a popular boat for beginners and experienced sailors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{additional}} apparatus required for Vitasound was relatively modest: two additional loudspeakers, the variable-gain amplifier and relay unit, and a reader {{for the control}} track which was a <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> retrofit <b>to</b> existing 35mm projectors. There were no changes in operating compared to showing a standard film, and prints, which cost no more to make than standard ones, were compatible with theaters not equipped for Vitasound. So in other circumstances Vitasound might well have become the de facto standard for release prints just as Dolby Stereo was to become 4 decades later.|$|R
25|$|In {{comparison}} to other ant species like Anoplolepis gracilipes, which rapidly take over areas {{they have been}} contained in, red imported fire ants are <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> control. The first proposals to controlling the ant occurred in 1957 when the United States Congress authorised an eradication program using federal and state funding. Research on the ant and its biology has been continuous after {{the establishment of an}} eradication program, and many chemicals were used to eliminate them. However, scientists discovered that these insecticides were killing native fauna, and the Environmental Protection Agency subsequently outlawed them. Some scientists even questioned whether the ants were pests or not. Today, {{it is unlikely that the}} red imported fire ant will be eradicated in areas such as the United States. Populations can be managed properly if an integrated approach is used. Some scientists have considered using the ants' natural enemies against it; this includes T. solenopsae and B. bassiana. Phorid flies have also been viewed as potential biological agents, as they can reduce foraging activity in red imported fire ants and affect population levels. However, they are unable to affect colony growth rate. In addition, parasitic ants, parasitic wasps, mites, other pathogens, nematodes, and fungi have been considered to be potential biological agents. Others suggest that populations can be maintained or reduced by manipulating several ecological factors.|$|E
25|$|Before the Nootka Crisis of 1789, Spain {{had long}} held that all foreign sailors in the Pacific Ocean {{were to be}} treated as enemies. Spanish claims of sovereignty, {{especially}} on the west coasts of the Americas, dated back centuries. One of the first serious threats to the Spanish claim came from the extension of Russian fur trading activity from Siberia to Alaska during the middle and later parts of the 18th century. Spain reacted not only by expanding the foothold already gained in Alta California but also by launching a series of exploration and reconnaissance voyages from San Blas, Mexico, to Alaska. The purpose of these voyages was not only to ascertain the Russian threat but to reinforce their claims of sovereignty by right of first-discovery and through the use of formal possession-taking rituals, which were still regarded as a meaningful part of international law. Another purpose was to search for a possible Northwest Passage, which, if it existed and fell under the control of another nation such as Britain, could prove disastrous to New Spain's Pacific coast. Juan Pérez was the first to sail to the far north, reaching the Queen Charlotte Islands in 1774. Subsequent expeditions were launched in 1775, 1779, and 1788. Detailed information about Russian activities in Alaska was acquired in 1788, including ominous indications that Russia might seize control of Nootka Sound. This, in addition to the rapidly increasing numbers of fur traders working the Pacific Northwest coastmainly British but also American and otherscoupled with Spain's firm claim of sovereignty north to 61°N latitude (the vicinity of Prince William Sound, Alaska), and the lack of any Spanish outpost north of California, made it imperative that a firm stand be taken. During the 1780s Nootka Sound had become the focal point of all these conflicting factors. It was perhaps not the best port of the region, but it was well known and well charted, <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> reach, and usefully located at a general base of operations and a place of rendezvous. Over the years it had become the fur-trader's primary harbour and gathering point. Factors such as these resulted in Russia, Britain, and Spain all deciding to build a fort there, in order to solidify their claims and interests. From Spain's perspective, which had long regarded the entire region as Spanish territory, the occupation of Nootka Sound would be the first step toward creating a new province of New Spain, north of California and south of Alaska. Implicit in such a plan was the restriction of free trade by other nations, a policy the Spanish had long enforced within the lands of the empire. The position of the British government, since the days of Queen Elizabeth, had been that its subjects had the right to navigate the ocean and visit, trade, and make settlements anywhere not already occupied by a civilized nation.|$|E

50|$|The ghost ring sight is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the fastest type of aperture sight. It is <b>fairly</b> accurate, <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> use, and obscures the target less than nearly all other non-optical sights. Because of this, ghost ring sights are commonly installed on combat shotguns and submachine guns (and to a much lesser extent, rifles). The ghost ring is a fairly recent innovation, and differs from traditional aperture sights in the extreme thinness of the rear ring, and the slightly thicker front sight. The thin ring minimizes the occlusion of the target, while the thicker front post makes it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> find quickly.|$|R
