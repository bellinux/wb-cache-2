While the <b>initial</b> <b>approach</b> to storage <b>area</b> networks has involved specialized networking technology, the emergence of Gigabit Ethernet technology has raised the question of whether we can use commodity IP networks for storage. This paper examines the issues involving IP storage networks and presents a performance analysis to dispel some of the myths and outline some of the challenges...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Initial</b> <b>Approach</b> Fix (IAF) is {{the point}} where the <b>initial</b> <b>approach</b> segment of an {{instrument}} approach begins. An instrument approach procedure may have more than one <b>Initial</b> <b>approach</b> fix and <b>initial</b> <b>approach</b> segment. The <b>initial</b> <b>approach</b> fix is usually a designated intersection, VOR, NDB, or DME fix. The <b>initial</b> <b>approach</b> fix may be collocated with the intermediate fix (IF) of the instrument approach and in such case they designate the beginning of the intermediate segment of the <b>approach.</b> When <b>initial</b> <b>approach</b> fix, and intermediate fix are combined there is no <b>initial</b> <b>approach</b> segment.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{developments}} on the Web {{are marked by}} the growing support for the Linked Data initiative, which encourages government and public organisations, as well as private institutions, to expose their data on the Web. This results in a plentitude of multi-lingual document collections where the original resources are published in the language, {{in which they are}} available. The challenges of multilingualism present on the Semantic Web are also re ected in the context of services on the Web, characterised by the rapid increase in popularity and use of Web APIs, as indicated by the growing number of available APIs and the applications built on top of them. Web APIs are commonly described in plain-text as part of Web pages, following no particular guidelines and conforming to no standards, despite some <b>initial</b> <b>approaches</b> in the <b>area</b> [1, 2]. Therefore, API providers publish descriptions in any language they see t, making the service discovery and the subsequent processing of the documentation challenging tasks. In this paper, we present a cross-lingual approach that calculates semantic similarity of text to help classify and annotate Web APIs, based on their textual descriptions. Furthermore, we show how our solution can be implemented as part of SWEET [3], which is a tool that enables the semi-automated creation of semantic Web API descriptions. In addition, we demonstrate how the cross-lingual approach can be adopted to support the language-independent discovery of Web APIs. ...|$|R
