5|$|Scottish art <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> is {{the body}} of visual art made in Scotland, by Scots, or about Scottish subjects, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> This period saw {{development}} of professionalisation, with art academies were established in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Art was increasingly influenced by Neoclassicism, the Enlightenment and {{towards the end of}} the century by Romanticism, with Italy becoming a major centre of Scottish art.|$|E

5|$|Proteins were {{recognized}} as a distinct class of biological molecules <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> by Antoine Fourcroy and others, distinguished by the molecules' ability to coagulate or flocculate under treatments with heat or acid.

5|$|Scottish {{religion}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> {{includes all}} forms of religious organisation and belief in Scotland <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> This period saw {{the beginnings of a}} fragmentation of the Church of Scotland that had been created in the Reformation and established on a fully Presbyterian basis after the Glorious Revolution. These fractures were prompted by issues of government and patronage, but reflected a wider division between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party. The legal right of lay patrons to present clergymen of their choice to local ecclesiastical livings led to minor schisms from the church. The first in 1733, known as the First Secession and headed by figures including Ebenezer Erskine, {{led to the creation of}} a series of secessionist churches. The second in 1761 led to the foundation of the independent Relief Church.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> the {{population}} of Gigha peaked at over 600, but had declined to just under 400 by {{the close of the}} 19th century. After half of millennium of association, the MacNeills sold the isle for Â£49,000 to James Williams Scarlett, a nephew of James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger in 1865. His son, Lieutenant-Colonel William James Scarlett built the mansion house of Achamore and Gigha remained in the family's hands until 1919.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century,</b> English {{merchant}} law {{was still}} {{based on the}} Lex mercatoria, a medieval series of customs and principles used to regulate trading. Other countries in Europe had reformed and modernised their law, resulting in English merchant law being about a century behind mercantile law of other European countries. A merchant was, by his very nature, international, and the inconsistencies between English law and the law of other nations made business difficult.|$|E
5|$|Artists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> (e.g., Henry Fuseli, William Rimmer) {{depicted}} the witches variously, as have many directors since. Some have exaggerated or sensationalised the hags, or have adapted them to different cultures, as in Orson Welles's {{rendition of the}} weird sisters as voodoo priestesses. Some film adaptations have cast the witches as such modern analogues as hippies on drugs, or goth schoolgirls. Their influence reaches the literary realm as well in such works as the Discworld and Harry Potter series.|$|E

5|$|Ethnically, the Middle Colonies {{were more}} diverse {{than the other}} British colonial regions in North America and {{tended to be more}} {{socially}} tolerant. For example, in New York, any foreigner professing Christianity was awarded citizenship, leading to a more diverse populace. As a consequence, early German settlements in the Americas concentrated in the Middle Colonies region. Indentured servitude was especially common in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century,</b> though fewer worked in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Henry III of England {{granted a}} market to the Bishop of Ely using letters close on 9April 1224 {{although}} Ely {{had been a}} trading centre prior to this. Present weekly market days are Thursday and Saturday and seasonal markets are held monthly on Sundays and Bank Holiday Mondays from Easter to November. The city is situated on the River Great Ouse, which was a significant means of transport until the fens were drained and Ely ceased to be an island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> The river is now a popular boating spot, and has a large marina.|$|E
5|$|Hillforts in Scotland are earthworks, {{sometimes}} with wooden or stone enclosures, built on higher ground, which usually include a significant settlement, built within the modern boundaries of Scotland. They were first studied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> {{and the first}} serious field research was undertaken in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century there were large numbers of archaeological investigations of specific sites, {{with an emphasis on}} establishing a chronology of the forts. Forts have been classified by type and their military and ritual functions have been debated.|$|E

5|$|In December 1887, Woodford {{contracted}} septicaemia from an untreated foot injury. He died on 23 December. He {{is seen as}} {{a pioneer}} of the Authentic school of masonic research, applying proper historical methodology in place of carelessly repeated fable. He earnestly collected and studied early masonic manuscripts, writing the introduction for Hughan's published collection. He contributed greatly {{to an understanding of the}} enigmatic history of the York lodges <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> His lasting legacy may be seen in the continued activity and influence of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, and the rational approach to masonic history.|$|E
5|$|Kinship was agnatic, with descent counted {{only through}} the male line, helping to build the {{importance}} of surnames and clans. The increased {{power of the state}} and economic change eroded the power of these organisations, and this process would accelerate as the government responded to the threat of Jacobite risings by undermining the power of clan chiefs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> The Reformation had a major impact on family life, changing the nature of baptism, marriage and burials, leading to a change in wider relationships, sacramental status and burial practices and placing a greater emphasis {{on the role of the}} father.|$|E
5|$|The Italian theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's {{concept of}} evil <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> He noted a {{distinction}} between using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as to why suffering exists.|$|E

5|$|The Sovereign still {{exercised}} a {{power to}} be reckoned with <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> The Court remained the centre of the political world. The King was limited in that he had to choose Ministers who could command a majority in Parliament, but the choice remained his. The leader of an administration still had to command the King's personal confidence and approval. A strong following in Parliament depended on being able to supply places, pensions, and other marks of Royal favour to the government's supporters.|$|E
5|$|The first Nonconformist {{congregation}} {{began in}} 1662 when the vicar of Cullompton, Revd William Crompton, was {{ejected from the}} established church. He continued to preach and a Protestant Dissenters meeting house was built in 1698 which became the Unitarian Chapel. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> there was a prevalence of Dissent with the local vicar recording in 1736 that of a population of 3358 there were 508 Presbyterians, 133 Anabaptists and 87 Quakers. By 1743 the first Baptist Chapel had been built. John Wesley's journal records preaching near the town in 1748 and on numerous occasions until 1789.|$|E
5|$|A {{network of}} roads {{developed}} in the Lowlands in this period. Drover's roads, between the Highlands and north-east England, had become established {{by the end of}} the seventeenth century and a series of military roads were built and maintained as a response to the Jacobite Risings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> At the beginning of the period, most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, but a system of land ownership based on large estates emerged. This was the beginning of a process that would create a landscape of rectangular fields and carefully located farm complexes with interconnecting roads. There was an attempt improve agriculture, resulting in new crops, techniques and enclosures began to displace the run rig system and free pasture.|$|E
