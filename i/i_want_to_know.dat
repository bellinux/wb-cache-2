2500|$|Dean {{began his}} bid for President as a [...] "long shot" [...] candidate. ABC News ranked him eighth out of 12 in a list of {{potential}} presidential contenders in May 2002. In March 2003 he gave a speech strongly critical of the Democratic leadership at the California State Democratic Convention that {{attracted the attention of}} grassroots party activists and set the tone and the agenda of his candidacy. It began with the line: [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> is what in the world so many Democrats are doing supporting the President's unilateral intervention in Iraq?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Rihanna takes {{influence}} {{from the different}} types of music she discovered when she came to America and revealed that rock music {{was one of the first}} genres she fell in love with. She commented, [...] "as I grow older, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more about music. I want to discover more types of music". She cited Brandy's fourth studio album, Afrodisiac (2004), as her main inspiration for her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007). In her early career, her music contained strong influences of Caribbean music, including reggae and dancehall. The music video of the song [...] "Rude Boy" [...] featured images inspired by her Caribbean roots.|$|E

There are probably twenty-five or thirty women—I certainly don’t count them—for whom I feel an abiding and deep emotional attachment. They’re {{scattered all over the}} planet. They range in age from less than half to almost twice my own. Most of these relationships are not actively sexual. Some were at one time. More never will be. But most of them feel as if they could become so. I love the feel of that tension, the delicious gravity of possibilities." ...|$|E

2500|$|As in his pre-trial appearance, at {{the opening}} of the 19 October Trial Saddam {{appeared}} defiant. He rejected the tribunal's legitimacy and independence from the control of the foreign occupation. [...] "I do not respond to this so-called court, with all due respect to its people, and I retain my constitutional right as the president of Iraq", Saddam declared. He added, [...] "Neither do I recognize the body that has designated and authorized you, nor the aggression because all that has been built on false basis is false." [...] When the judge asked for his name, Saddam refused, stating [...] "I am the president of the Iraq". He returned the question, asking Kurdish judge Rizgar Mohammed Amin, [...] "Who are you? <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who you are." [...] When Amin addressed Saddam as [...] "the former president", Saddam objected emphatically, saying he was still the President of the Republic of Iraq and had not been deposed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{arrest of}} Radovan Karadžić {{took place on}} 21 July 2008 in Belgrade. He was in hiding, posing as a doctor of {{alternative}} medicine mostly in Belgrade but also in Vienna, Austria. [...] Karadžić was transferred into ICTY custody in the Hague on 30 July. Karadžić appeared before judge Alphons Orie on 31 July, in the tribunal, which has sentenced 64 accused since 1993. During the first hearing Radovan Karadžić expressed a fear for his life by saying: [...] "If Holbrooke wants my death and regrets there is no death sentence at this court, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if his arm is long enough to reach me here." [...] and stated that the deal he made with Richard Holbrooke {{is the reason why}} it took 13 years for him to appear in front of the ICTY. He made similar accusations against the former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnian foreign minister at the time, claimed that a Karadžić-Holbrooke deal was made in July 1996.|$|E
2500|$|While {{traveling}} on his tour bus with the Four Tops on May 15, 1969, Four Tops member Renaldo [...] "Obie" [...] Benson witnessed {{an act of}} police brutality and violence committed on anti-war protesters who had been protesting at Berkeley's People's Park in what was later termed as [...] "Bloody Thursday". A disgusted Benson later told author Ben Edmonds, [...] "I saw this and started wondering 'what was going on, what is happening here?' One question led to another. Why are they sending kids far away from their families overseas? Why are they attacking their own kids in the street?" [...] Returning to Detroit, Motown songwriter Al Cleveland wrote and composed a song based on his conversations with Benson {{of what he had}} seen in Berkeley. Benson sent the unfinished song to his bandmates but the other Four Tops turned the song down. Benson said, [...] "My partners told me it was a protest song. I said 'no man it's a love song, about love and understanding. I'm not protesting. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what's going on.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1945, Brando's agent {{recommended}} he take a co-starring role in The Eagle Has Two Heads with Tallulah Bankhead, {{produced by}} Jack Wilson. Bankhead had {{turned down the}} role of Blanche Dubois in A Streetcar Named Desire, which Williams had written for her, to tour the play for the 1946-1947 season. Bankhead recognized Brando's potential, despite her disdain (which most Broadway veterans shared) for method acting, and agreed to hire him even though he auditioned poorly. The two clashed greatly during the pre-Broadway tour, with Bankhead reminding Brando of his mother, being her age and also having a drinking problem. Wilson was largely tolerant of Brando's behavior, but he reached his limit when Brando mumbled through a dress rehearsal shortly before the November 28, 1946, opening. [...] "I don't care what your grandmother did," [...] Wilson exclaimed, [...] "and that Method stuff, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what you're going to do!" [...] Brando in turn raised his voice, and acted with great power and passion. [...] "It was marvelous," [...] a cast member recalled. [...] "Everybody hugged him and kissed him. He came ambling offstage and said to me, 'They don't think you can act unless you can yell.'" ...|$|E

The {{world is full of}} people who do things just about right. Just about. And a few on the top do them just right—most of the time. Nobody's perfect! When are you going to start to demand of yourself what I demand of myself? When {{are you going to be}} as uncompromising with what you do as I am uncompromising in what I hear and what I insist on? When? Are you waiting for some miracle? The miracle will be when you demand of yourself everything you've got of yourself. That'll be the day. And I don't only mean 5 minutes of 10; I mean 10 minutes out of 10; I mean 60 minutes out of an hour, 24 hours a day, at least all of your waking hours. ... I don't want it just about right! To me, just about right is terrible! ... Now, nobody's killed when you play a half-note as a dotted quarter. But you might, from learning to play a half-note a full half-note, make the difference in the lives of 50,000 little kids. ... You don't piddle with music—it's a good-time-Charlie business, and for me, the wonderful good times come out of hearing somebody play beautifully. I don't care if it's ‘Stars and Stripes,’ ‘The Victors’ or what it is. I mean, there's a pride. And this guy knows he's good! And nobody can take that away from him. When they play sloppy and don't care or don't know—a great many of them don't even know, they don't know how bad it is—they can be forgiven, but more they should be pitied.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Opinions {{differed}} about Fancourt's melodramatic {{style in}} his roles, especially {{his interpretation of}} his best-known role, that of the Mikado of Japan, and his famous Mikado laugh. Frederic Lloyd, who joined the D'Oyly Carte in 1951 and had studied the company's history, told an interviewer that Fancourt invented his interpretation, concerned that the earlier movements used during the Mikado's song could {{be taken as a}} Fagin-like caricature. [...] According to Lloyd, Fancourt had said that, because of his Jewish background, [...] "I just couldn't go through those movements, it would bother me", and Lloyd reported that, when Fancourt showed Rupert D'Oyly Carte and his stage director J. M. Gordon his new business for the song, they were delighted. Jessie Bond, who had played Pitti-Sing in the 1885 première, was unimpressed: [...] "Who, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> intended that the Mikado should prance about like a madman, hissing out his lines like a serpent? ... The raving monster we so often see now is not one bit like the suave and oily Mikado created [...] at the Savoy." [...] The Times thought that he [...] "undoubtedly loses {{a good deal of the}} Mikado's humour... his 'humane Mikado' scene is the one which seems to have travelled farthest from the 'Savoy tradition'." [...] A later Times review commented more favourably: [...] "Mr Darrell Fancourt... can (and did) add a terrifying aspect to the benignity of his humaner punishment manifesto, and left us wondering how his vocal cords ever managed to function normally after those expressions of emphasis with which he punctuated its paragraphs." [...] The Manchester Guardian praised Fancourt's fresh approach and added, [...] "He makes more of the punishment-fitting-the-crime song than we can remember having seen from any other actor." [...] The Pall Mall Gazette said, [...] "Mr Fancourt has recognised that people can do with a 'thrill' in these Grand Guignol days. So he has given us a Mikado who really does curdle the blood, with a voice like a steam hammer slowly crushing a ton of Brazil nuts, and a make up of ghastly villainy, and a fiendish, gurgling laugh, which must be heard to be appreciated." [...] Another critic described the sound of Fancourt's laugh as [...] "a dragon getting up steam". With respect to Fancourt's portrayal of the Pirate King, fellow actor Henry Lytton told an interviewer, [...] "The King should be a story book pirate, not a real one and blood thirsty to boot. But that's the way Mr. Fancourt plays it".|$|E
