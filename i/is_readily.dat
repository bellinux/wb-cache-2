5|$|Although some guides {{indicate}} {{the species is}} edible with suitable preparation (such as boiling), it is generally not recommended for consumption {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other toxic Gyromitra species that contain the compound gyromitrin. When boiled in water, or digested in the body, this compound <b>is</b> <b>readily</b> hydrolyzed to the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine—used as a propellant in some rocket fuels.|$|E

5|$|Direct {{reaction}} of indium with the pnictogens produces the gray or semimetallic III–V semiconductors.

5|$|Geastrum quadrifidum <b>is</b> <b>readily</b> {{confused}} with G.fornicatum, which is larger—up to —and has smaller spores (4–5μm in diameter). Geastrum minimum, although small like G.quadrifidum, is distinguished by having more rays (usually more than seven), {{and it is}} not fornicate. Also, its mycelial layer is attached to the fibrous layer for a long time, without forming a mycelial cup like G.quadrifidum. The Chilean species G.jurei does not have a clearly demarcated peristome.|$|E
5|$|In sailing, it {{has long}} been known that if the bearing from the target to the pursuer remains {{constant}}, known as constant bearing, decreasing range (CBDR), equivalent to taking a fixed reference point at infinite distance, the two vessels are on a collision course, both travelling in straight lines. In a simulation, this <b>is</b> <b>readily</b> observed as the lines between the two remain parallel at all times.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the breed}} first became commercial, it {{has spread to}} Canada and become a major {{contributor}} in the commercial lamb industry. The breed adapts well to confinement and <b>is</b> <b>readily</b> used in accelerated crossbreeding programs. Polled Dorsets thrive under grass-based and feedlot conditions and are more suitable on small farms that are intensely managed.|$|E
5|$|The flowers hold profuse {{amounts of}} nectar and are pollinated by honeyeaters. Although L.formosa is {{uncommon}} in cultivation, it is straightforward {{to grow in}} soils with good drainage and a partly shaded to sunny aspect. It <b>is</b> <b>readily</b> propagated by seed. Unlike all {{other members of the}} genus Lambertia, L.formosa is greatly resistant to the soil pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi.|$|E
5|$|The metal <b>is</b> <b>readily</b> {{attacked}} by most acids. Sulfuric acid is a notable exception because passivation stops the reaction by forming the insoluble barium sulfate on the surface. Barium combines with several metals, including aluminium, zinc, lead, and tin, forming intermetallic phases and alloys.|$|E

5|$|Weather is {{a chaotic}} system that <b>is</b> <b>readily</b> {{modified}} by small {{changes to the}} environment, so accurate weather forecasting is limited to only a few days. Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium is a soft, {{malleable}} and ductile {{chemical element}} that displays a bright silvery luster when pure. It {{is a rare}} earth element, and it <b>is</b> <b>readily</b> dissolved by the strong mineral acids. It reacts slowly with cold water and it oxidizes slowly in air.|$|E
5|$|A hamster {{in captivity}} can {{occasionally}} eat mealworms or earthworms, which have high protein contents. Boiled {{egg whites and}} small pieces of clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, sunflower seeds, and locusts. The teeth of Campbell's dwarf hamster never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must therefore gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from growing into {{the skin of the}} mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from nontoxic trees, such as apple and willow, <b>is</b> <b>readily</b> used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity.|$|E

5|$|Above the chromosphere, {{in a thin}} (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but <b>is</b> <b>readily</b> observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E

In 2005, while most states that had passed medical marijuana bills over the past decade saw marijuana use among teenagers decline faster than the national average (a 43% decrease), Oregon, Nevada, and Maine saw smaller decreases than the average.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they grow}} {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates {{the plants and}} promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species <b>is</b> <b>readily</b> propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin <b>is</b> <b>readily</b> {{broken down}} in the body to {{salicylic}} acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium nitride, Be3N2 is a {{high-melting-point}} compound which <b>is</b> <b>readily</b> hydrolyzed. Beryllium azide, BeN6 {{is known}} and beryllium phosphide, Be3P2 {{has a similar}} structure to Be3N2. Basic beryllium nitrate and basic beryllium acetate have similar tetrahedral structures with four beryllium atoms coordinated to a central oxide ion. A number of beryllium borides are known, such as Be5B, Be4B, Be2B, BeB2, BeB6 and BeB12. Beryllium carbide, Be2C, is a refractory brick-red compound that reacts with water to give methane. No beryllium silicide has been identified.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine gas {{was also}} used during the Iraq War in Anbar Province in 2007, with insurgents packing truck bombs with mortar shells and {{chlorine}} tanks. The attacks killed two people from the explosives and sickened more than 350. Most of the deaths were caused {{by the force of}} the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the toxic gas <b>is</b> <b>readily</b> dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. In some bombings, over a hundred civilians were hospitalized due to breathing difficulties. The Iraqi authorities tightened security for elemental chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water to the population.|$|E
