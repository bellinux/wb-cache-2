Entirely sculpted, one finds representations of the instruments of the Passion on one of the pilasters.|$|E
500|$|Sweet-tasting hot {{chocolate}} was then invented, leading {{hot chocolate}} {{to become a}} luxury item among the European nobility by the 17th century. Even when the first Chocolate House (an establishment similar to a modern coffee shop) opened in 1657, chocolate was still very expensive, costing 50 to 75 pence (approximately 10-15 shillings) a pound. At the time, hot chocolate was often mixed with spices for flavor; one notable recipe was hot chocolate [...] "infused with fresh <b>jasmine</b> <b>flowers,</b> amber, musk, vanilla and ambergris." [...] In the late 17th century, Hans Sloane, president of the Royal College of Physicians, visited Jamaica. There, he tried chocolate and considered it [...] "nauseous", but found it became more palatable when mixed with milk. When he returned to England, he brought the recipe with him, introducing milk chocolate to England. [...] The aristocratic nature of the drink led to chocolate being referred to as [...] "the drink of the gods" [...] in 1797.|$|E

60|$|Still {{the prince}} stood before her with downcast eyes and suffused cheeks: even {{the spur of}} {{contempt}} failed to arouse his energies. Then the maiden called to her friend, who was picking <b>jasmine</b> <b>flowers</b> {{so as not to}} witness the scene, and angrily asked why that strange man was allowed to stand and stare at her? The friend, in hot wrath, threatened to call the slave, and throw Vajramukut into the pond unless he instantly went away with his impudence. But as the prince was rooted to the spot, and really had not heard a word of what had been said to him, the two women were obliged to make the first move.|$|E
60|$|Vajramukut {{was nearly}} fainting as {{the flood of}} splendour broke upon him. Recovering himself he gazed around the rooms, and {{presently}} a tumult of delight invaded his soul, and his body bristled with joy. [FN#62] The scene was that of fairyland. Golden censers exhaled the most costly perfumes, and gemmed vases bore the most beautiful flowers; silver lamps containing fragrant oil illuminated doors whose panels were wonderfully decorated, and walls adorned with pictures in which such figures were formed that on seeing them the beholder was enchanted. On {{one side of the}} room stood a bed of flowers and a couch covered with brocade of gold, and strewed with freshly-culled <b>jasmine</b> <b>flowers.</b> On the other side, arranged in proper order, were attar holders, betel-boxes, rose-water bottles, trays, and silver cases with four partitions for essences compounded of rose leaves, sugar, and spices, prepared sandal wood, saffron, and pods of musk. Scattered about a stuccoed floor white as crystal, were coloured caddies of exquisite confections, and in others sweetmeats of various kinds.[FN#63] Female attendants clothed in dresses of various colours were standing each according to her rank, with hands respectfully joined. Some were reading plays and beautiful poems, others danced and others performed with glittering fingers and flashing arms on various instruments --the ivory lute, the ebony pipe and the silver kettledrum. In short, all the means and appliances of pleasure and enjoyment were there; and any description of the appearance of the apartments, which were the wonder of the age, is impossible.|$|E

50|$|Tea {{leaves are}} {{harvested}} {{in the early}} spring and stored until the late summer when fresh <b>jasmine</b> <b>flowers</b> are in bloom. <b>Jasmine</b> <b>flowers</b> are picked early in the day when the small petals are tightly closed. The flowers are kept cool until nightfall. During the night <b>jasmine</b> <b>flowers</b> open, and release their fragrance, and this is when the tea scenting takes place. There are two main methods used to scent the tea with the jasmine. In one method the tea and flowers are placed in alternating layers; in the other, the tea is blended with <b>jasmine</b> <b>flowers</b> and stored overnight. It takes over four hours for the tea to absorb the fragrance and flavour of the jasmine blossoms. The scenting process may be repeated as many as six or seven times for top grades such as Yin Hao. The tea absorbs moisture from the fresh <b>Jasmine</b> <b>flowers</b> so it must be dried again to prevent spoilage.|$|E
