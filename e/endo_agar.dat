40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{monitoring results}} of the spread of opportunistic and pathogenic microorganisms in patients of surgical departments of the Dniprodzerzhynsk city hospital No 7. 1464 strains of bacteria isolated from biological material of the patients from January to December 2012 were studied. Relevant standard methods of research and data interpretation {{in accordance with the}} regulatory guidelines were used. The microorganisms’ sensitivity to antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method. Assessment of the resistance of isolated microorganisms to antibiotics was made with the software Whonet 5. 1. At the first stage of investigation sampling biological material and inoculation in the culture medium were made. The discharges of wounds, throat, nose, ears, vagina and urethra, and also urine from patients of surgical departments were sampled for bacteriological analysis. The main substratum was 5 % blood agar. There may additionally be used the selective growth media (yolk-salt <b>agar,</b> <b>Endo,</b> and Saburo). At the second stage we identify microorganisms with bacterioscopic, bacteriological and biochemical methods. Identifying microorganisms of the genus Staphylococcus was made by the reaction of lecithinase presence, plasma-coagulation reaction and the mannitol oxidation reaction. For the identification of bacteria of the family Streptococcaceae the growth pattern in 0. 5 % sugar medium was used. It was differentiated from bacteria of the genus Enterococcus by plating onto egg yolk agar base and milk with 0. 1 % methylene blue. Identification of bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family was made by studying their colonies on dense differential diagnostic media. Suspicious colonies were transferred on a combined medium for primary identification (Olkenitsky's medium). Then the biochemical signs of enterobacteria were studied in the minimum number of tests. The third phase of the study included the determination of the sensitivity of microorganisms to antibiotics. To do that, we use the disc diffusion method. The antibiogram tests of isolated bacterial strains used Mueller-Hinton agar. According to the data obtained we assign of microorganisms to certain category of sensitivity: sensitive, moderately resistant or resistant. Monitoring of prevalent microorganisms showed that 61 % (893 of 1464) isolates were gram-positive bacteria, 696 strains of them are staphylococci. 477 of these are identified as S. aureus, representing 68. 5 % of all Staphylococcus. We found coagulase negative staphylococci in 192 patients, and the strains of S.  haemolyticus are dominated. Strains of the family Streptococcaceae isolated from 197 patients. Among them the E. faecalis accounted for 66 % {{of the total number of}} Streptococcus. Gram negative bacteria were presented by the families Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae. Enterobacteriaceae accounted for 90. 7 % (518 of 571). E.  coli plays the leading role and accounted for 42 % of all Enterobacteriaceae. The strains of P. aeruginosa were identified in 53 patients. S.  haemolyticus has played an important role as a pathogen as well as S. aureus. Its resistance to antibiotics is much higher than that of S.  aureus. Although S. haemolyticus is opportunistic coagulase negative, it can be isolated from patients not only with chronic, but with acute infection. Thus nowadays the strains of S. haemolyticus gained high pathogenic and virulent properties...|$|R
40|$|Total {{coliform}} counts {{obtained by}} means of standard membrane filtration techniques, using MacConkey agar, m-Endo LES agar, Teepol agar, and pads saturated with Teepol broth as growth media, were compared. Various combinations of these media were used in tests on 490 samples of river water and city wastewater after different stages of conventional purification and reclamation processes including lime treatment, and filtration, active carbon treatment, ozonation, and chlorination. <b>Endo</b> <b>agar</b> yielded the highest average counts for all these samples. Teepol agar generally had higher counts then Teepol broth, whereas MacConkey agar had the lowest average counts. Identification of 871 positive isolates showed that Aeromonas hydrophila was the species most commonly detected. Species of Escherichia, Citrobacter, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter represented 55 % of isolates which conformed {{to the definition of}} total coliforms on <b>Endo</b> <b>agar,</b> 54 % on Teepol agar, and 45 % on MacConkey agar. Selection for species on the media differed considerably. Evaluation of these data and literature on alternative tests, including most probable number methods, indicated that the technique of choice for routine analysis of total coliform bacteria in drinking water is membrane filtration using m-Endo LES agar as growth medium without enrichment procedures or a cytochrome oxidase restriction...|$|E
40|$|The {{means for}} {{distinguishing}} Escherichia from Aerobacter (Enterobacter) differ in laboratories and range from complete dependence on colonial reactions on typical gram-negative media to reliance {{on one or}} more of the classical indole, methyl red, Voges-Proskauer, citrate (IMViC) parameters. Three colonial types (one prejudged as Escherichia) of lactose-positive rods were catalogued on each of the most commonly used selective media, MacConkey Agar, <b>Endo</b> <b>Agar,</b> and E M B Agar. Each cultural type was presumptively diagnosed and then compared with the expected outcome of individual IMViC tests. The distribution of preliminary identifications was similar from growth patterns on MacConkey Agar and E M B Agar, but it differed markedly from <b>Endo</b> <b>Agar.</b> When organisms initially diagnosed by cultural methods were compared by single IMViC tests, it was found that for each colonial type one of the biochemical parameters was best suited. Thus, for those types initially considered Escherichia, the methyl red or Voges-Proskauer test results agreed most consistently; for other types, the citrate reaction was most satisfactory. In addition, when newly formulated reagent-impregnated paper strip methods for indole, Voges-Proskauer, and citrate were evaluated and compared to the standard methods, agreement was 97 % for indole, 90 % for Voges-Proskauer, and 95 % for Simmons' citrate...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and study}} aims: Due to the {{sometimes}} insufficient reprocessing of endoscopes the usual {{four to six}} month time interval between monitorings may be to long to allow rapid detection of potential flaws. Hence {{our aim was to}} examine whether dipslides, which are normally used in other areas for detecting microorganisms, can also be used as a rapid self-control method for processed endoscopes. Methods: We selected 18 commercially available dipslides and examined the rinse solutions of non-processed gastroscopes and colonoscopes. The samples were diluted and examined using dipslides and additionally plated on TSA and <b>Endo</b> <b>Agar</b> serving as reference media. Results: 1. The median of almost all dipslides showed equal or higher bacterial counts than the both reference medias. 2. Considering the median and the single values dipslides no. 5 (Petrifilm AC) and no. 12 showed best results. 3. All dipslides gave higher bacterial counts for colonoscopes than for gastroscopes related to TSA. 4. Related to <b>Endo</b> <b>Agar</b> dipslides gave comparable results as the reference medium in colonoscopies. Conclusions: Dipslides should not be viewed as a substitute for routine laboratory analyses. Some of the examined dipslides can be recommended for screening of the endoscope reprocessing results, especially swellable dipslides with a low detection limit. Moreover, any bacterial growth detected by means of dipslides with a low detection limit generates an immediate call for action...|$|E
40|$|A {{solid-phase}} sandwich assay {{that was}} able to differentiate heat-labile-enterotoxin-producing colonies of Escherichia coli and choleratoxin-producing colonies of Vibrio cholerae from nontoxigenic colonies is described. Flexible polyvinyl chloride plastic film coated with antibody molecules was allowed to react with partially lysed bacterial colonies in a standard petri dish. The immobilized antigen on the plastic film was then labeled with radioiodinated antibody. Autoradiography identified antigen-containing colonies. As little as 5 to 25 pg of pure toxin contained in a 3 - to 4 -mm-diameter circle was reliably detected by this method. The synthesis of heat-labile enterotoxin and choleratoxin by cells growing on selective media such as eosin methylene blue agar, MacConkey agar, <b>Endo</b> <b>agar,</b> and thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar was demonstrated.

40|$|The strains # 2922 and 3534 are Gram-negative rods {{which were}} {{isolated}} by Seligmann and Saphra as lactose fermenting enterobacteriaceae (coli-form organisms) possessing complete antigens of S. newington. When the stab cultures, sent from Dr. Saphra, were plated on <b>Endo</b> <b>agar,</b> they produced {{two types of}} colonies; one dark red with a metalic sheen and the other white. By subculture of the white colonies of the strain # 2922 it was reconfirmed to ferment lactose slowly in peptone water and to produce small red papillae on the white colonies as described by Seligmann and Saphra. However, {{in the case of}} red colony-forming cells of the strain # 2922, the author's findings were slightly different from the description of Seligmann and Saphra. They reported that white colony variants appeared very rarely from red colony formers, i. e. once after oral administration to mice and once on subcultures which were made frequently from agar slant culture during 8 weeks. Experiments were conducted to study the cause of the above difference, and {{it was found that the}} white colony variants can easily be obtained when the red colony formers were cultured under anaerobic conditions. From the strain 3534 a lactose (rapid) fermenter and a non fermenter were obtained. The former behaved as its counterpart in the strain # 2922 did, but the latter did not produce the red papilla on <b>Endo</b> <b>agar</b> plate and failed to ferment lactose in peptone water even in the course of 3 weeks observation. The intermediate type of cells between lactose fermenter and non-fermenter as reported by Seligmann and Saphra, was not isolated when single cell cultures were made by mieromanipulation. This suggests that the intermediate type of cells may have been a mixture of lactose fermenter and non-fermenter.

This {{study was designed to}} determine the correlation between Escherichia coli as the indicator bacterium, on the one hand, and Salmonella and Shigella Spp. As the pathogenic bacteria, on the other hand. Materials and Methods: Totally, 60 natural water samples were collected from natural rivers in Gorgan during summer and autumn of 2016. In order to detect Escherichia coli, the membrane filter method with <b>Endo</b> <b>agar</b> and IMVIC test was used and, in order to detect Salmonella and Shigella, the 9 -tube fermentation method and biochemical tests with selenite F medium, XLD agar, TSI, urea, and SIM were utilized. For the statistical analysis, Pearson’s correlation test was used at the significance coefficient of < 0. 05. Results: Results showed that all of the analyzed bacteria were detected in the water samples. The frequency of Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Enterobacter, and Citrobacter was 9. 5, 22. 2, 4. 8, 22. 2, and 65. 1 %, respectively. The statistical analysis demonstrated no statistical correlation between Escherichia coli, on the one hand, and Salmonella and Shigella, on the other hand; but the relationship between Salmonella and Shigella was significant.

40|$|Introduction. The staye of {{intestinal}} microflora {{affects the}} work of the whole organism. When composition of normal ibtestine microflora changes, its restoration is required. In our days a wide variety of probiotic drugs are available on the market which can be used to solve this problem. Most bacteria having probiotic properties represent the families Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which have poor resistance to acidic content of the stomach and toxic effects of bile salts. Various studies have clearly shown that in a person with normal acidic and bile secretion, the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are not detected after the passage through the duodenum, i. e., they perish before reaching the small intestines. In this study we compared the survival of different microorganisms which are contained in 9 probiotic drugs in a model of gastric and intestinal environments. Material and methods. In the laboratory of SI: “Mechnikov Institute Microbiology and Immunology, National Ukrainian Academy Medical Sciences" the in vitro experiments have been evaluated to test the ability of different probiotic bacteria which were contained in 9 probiotic drugs to survive the impact of the model environment of the stomach and duodenum. Bacillus coagulans persistence was evaluated under impact of simulated environment of the stomach and duodenum, it also was assessed by the quantity of CFU by incubation on culture medium. The following were studied: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis BB- 12, Saccharomyces boulardii, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus clausii, Enterococcus faecium. Microorganisms were incubated for 3 hours in a model environment of the stomach (pepsin 3 g / l, hydrochloric acid of 160 mmol / l, pH 2. 3), later after centrifugation and washing, they were incubated for 3 hours in intestinal model environment (bile salts 3 % pancreatin 0. 1 %, pH 7. 0). Inoculation was performed before incubation, after incubation in the gastric medium and after incubation in intestinal medium. We used the medium corresponding to the studied genus of bacteria - MRS-environment for lactobacilli, bifidum for Bifidobacterium, sabouraud medium for the isolation of yeasts and fungi and <b>endo</b> <b>agar</b> for the isolation of Enterobacteriaceae. We assessed the quantity of CFU before and after impact. Results and discussion. After incubation in a simulated gastric environment, bacteria of the type Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium did not survive and were not defined. Only Bacillus coagulans and Saccharomyces boulardii were resistant. These microorganisms grew after incubation in the same amount as before incubation - 105 - 6 and 107 - 8 CFU respectively. Bacillus clausii also survived in these conditions, but to a lesser extent: initially - 107 CFU, after incubation - 105 CFU. After staying in model environment of the duodenum Bacillus coagulans and Saccharomyces boulardii were still fully viable, and the number of germinating Bacillus clausii bacteria decreased by an order - up to 104 CFU. Conclusion. The probiotics containing Bacillus coagulans and Saccharomyces boulardii showed complete resistance to the impact of the model environment of the stomach and duodenum, Bacillus clausii was partially resistant. It leads to conclusion that probiotic drugs containing lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, cannot withstand the aggressive environmental influence of the stomach and duodenum and become inactivated under their influence. Probiotic drugs Enterol containing yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, and Laktovit Forte containing the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus coagulans are completely resistant to the action of the model environment of the stomach and duodenum...|$|E
40|$|The project {{undertaken}} {{aimed at}} the exploitation of locally isolated bacteria {{for the production of}} amino acids. For this purpose, six strains of amino acid producing-bacteria were isolated from local soils and water samples by employing nutrient agar, Leifson's medium (18), MacConkey's bi 1 esalt-lactose-peptone liquid and agar media (20), and EMB agar. The methods employed in the screening and isolation procedures were microscopic examination of unstained and stained slide preparations, plating methods, presumptive coliform test and Eijkman test. Cultural morphological and physiological studies showed that the strains isolated were Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella czaenae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis, representing families Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae and Bacillaceae respectively. Cultural characteristics were studied by observing size, shape, margin, elevation, consistancy, odour, optical features and pigmentation of colonies on agar plates (nutrient agar, MacConkey agar, EMB agar, <b>Endo</b> <b>agar</b> and ammonium salt glucose agar), as well as growth patterns on agar slants, gelatin stabs, potatoes and nutrient broth. Streak, pour and spread plate techniques (17, 24) were used in the preparation or agar plates. Cultural characteristic studies revealed that E. coli, A. aerogenes and K. ozaenae were lactose fermenters and produced pink Colonies of different shades, having different consistancies, on MacConkey agar. The colonies of A. aerogenes resembled those of E. coli in every respect except for the slightly mucoid character exhibited by the former. K. ozaenae, though a lactose fermenter, produced much bigger and highly mucoid colonies which coalesced and became golden-brown with age. The colonies of P. fluorescens resembled those of E. coli and A. aerogenes in shape, smoothness, edge and elevation, and produced good growth on MacConkey agar. However the organisms were found to be non-Iactose-fermenters and chromogenetic, and made the dark brown colour of MacConkey agar dirty due to the excretion of greenish colour into the medium:. B. subtilis and B. megaterium failed to grow on MacConkey agar even after prolonged incubation, under optimum growth conditions. Thus MacConkey agar was found to be an excellent differential as well as selective medium which enabled not only the separation of Gram-negative fromGram-positive bacilli, but also helped to distinguish lactose fermenting Gram-negative bacilli from non-lactose fermenters. Morphological characteristi s were studied by means of Gram reaction (25, 312), acid fastness (Ziel-Neelson's method), motility test (26, 27) and spore test (heat resistant method) with modifications where required. Gram reaction revealed that E. coli, A. aerogenes, K. ozaenae and P. fluorescens were Gram-negative and species of Bacillus were Gram-positive. The cells of E. coli, A. aerogenes and p. fluorescens were seen to be short rods of 0. 5 by 1. 5 microns, 0. 8 by 1. 9 microns and 0. 28 by 1 microns respectively. The cells of K. ozaenae were found to been capsulated plump rods of 0. 9 by 2. 8 microns. All these Gram-negative bacilli were found to be non-spore formers and arranged mostly singly and rarely in pairs'. The cells of the species of Bacillus, appeared to be straight rectangular rods of 1. 5 to 2 by 5. 5 to 6 microns, occurring singly and also in pairs, and arranged end to end in chains'. They were found to be sporeformers - the spores being oval in-shape and central in position and nearly of the same cross diameter as the bacilli. Microscopic examination was done under oil immersion at a magnification of 2000 times by means of bright field microscopy. Test for acid fastness showed that the bacteria tested were all non-acid fast. The motility test revealed that E. coli and P. fluorescens were actively motile, A. aerognes slightly motile and K. ozaenae and species of Bacillus non-motile. It was seen from the spore test that only the species of Bacillus bore spores and the rest were non-spore formers. Physiological studies performed included Catalase test (29, 30), Oxidase test (32, 33, 34, 35), Oxidation fermentation test (O. F. test) (37), Indole production test (40, 41, 42), Methyl red test (44), Voges Proskaur test (45, 47, 306, 310), Citrate utilization test (48), Haemolysin production test (50, 51), Oxygen relation (54, 161), Hydrogen-sulphide production test (55, 56), Urease activity test (57, 58), temperature relation (159, 160), pH for growth (170, 171, 172, 173), Nitrate reduction test (304), Gluconate test (307), Carbohydrate break-doM 1 test (309, 311). The results of these tests revealed that indole was produced only by E. coli whereas acetylmethyl carbinol production was done by A. aerogenes. K. ozaenae and B. subtilies A positive methyl red test was shown by E. coli & K. Ozaenae but citrate was utilized by all organisms but E. coli gattalse production was observed in case or all bacteria but E. coli, and a positive oxidase test was given by K. ozaenae and P. fluorescens only. Hydrogen sulphide was produced by B. subtilis & P. fluorescens but nitrate was reduced by all the bacteria but B. megaterium. Ammonia production was shown by K. ozaenae, P. fluorescens and species of Bacillus. From the results or of test, it was evident that p. fluorescens was oxidative, B. subtilis, was oxidative as well as fermentative, whereas E. coli A. aerogenes and K. ozaenae were fermentative. A wholly positive gluconate test was obtained only in case of A. aerogenes. Acid and gas production varied in carbohydrate-break-down-test. For example acid and gas were produced by E. Coli, A. aerogenes and K. Ozaenae in glucose, sucrose and lactose, whereas acid without gas was produced by B. subtilis, B. megaterium and P. fluorescens in glucose. Acid was produced by all the organisms in mannitol. A partial haemolysis of blood was brought about only by species of Bacillus. Optimum growth temperature in case of all gram-negative bacilli was found to be 37 o C but in case of B. subtillis, and B. Megaterium, it ranged between 25 o to 35 oC. All organisms under study were found to be aerobic but species of Bacillus were also facultatively anaerobic. pH for growth ranged from 6. 5 to 7. 5. Identification of bacteria was achieved by comparing the results obtained, with those recorded in the diagnostic tables given by Cowan and steel (21) {{as well as with the}} information given in Bargey's manual of Determinative Bacteriology (60).
