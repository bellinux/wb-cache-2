5|$|Director Jewison can put <b>his</b> <b>cards</b> on the table, let {{his camera}} cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a tricky shot into a side pocket {{undoubtedly}} offers more range. Kid {{also has a}} less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E
25|$|The winless run entered {{double figures}} when Middlesbrough went down 3–0 away to West Bromwich Albion. Injuries to Pogatetz and Walker meant a {{reshuffle}} in both defense and midfield, and after just four minutes Boro were behind. The defense appealed {{in vain for}} offside as Chris Brunt fired home a heavily deflected shot. Another deflection saw Robert Koren's strike roll past Ross Turnbull to put the home side two goals up {{early in the second}} half. It got worse for the visitors had Didier Digard sent off for appearing to jump into a challenge on Borja Valero. Koren got his second goal not long after to add to Boro's misery. West Brom's win over Boro, added to their win earlier in the season, meant they completed their first ever Premier League double. The Middlesbrough players reaction to Digard's sending off lead to The FA charging the club with failing to control their players. A handful of Boro players surrounded referee Mark Halsey to protest as he tried to push Digard off of the pitch, with Halsey dropping one of <b>his</b> <b>cards</b> as a result. Middlesbrough finally dropped into the relegation zone following Tottenham's victory over Portsmouth the following day.|$|E
25|$|Manchester United went to Wigan on {{the final}} day of the season, knowing that they needed only to equal or better Chelsea's result against Bolton in order to be Premier League champions, due to their {{superior}} goal difference. Wayne Rooney was named in the United starting lineup despite concerns over his fitness, while Nemanja Vidić made a return to the side for the first time since his concussion against Chelsea. Wigan started the game with an aggressive mentality, closing down the United players at every opportunity. Paul Scholes was booked early on for a tackle from behind on Wilson Palacios, but the Latics then had a penalty shout turned down in the 24th minute, when a Jason Koumas shot appeared to deflect off Rio Ferdinand's outstretched upper arm. Wigan's anguish was then compounded when referee Steve Bennett awarded United a penalty for Emmerson Boyce's foul on Wayne Rooney. Cristiano Ronaldo stepped up to take the penalty, which he converted, equalling Alan Shearer's record for the most goals in a 38-game season with 31 goals. Soon after, Scholes was fortunate not to be sent off when he cynically brought down Wilson Palacios. Fortunately for Scholes, Steve Bennett chose to keep <b>his</b> <b>cards</b> in his pocket. In the second half, United continued to test the Wigan goal, but goalkeeper Chris Kirkland was up to the task, producing a number of good saves. Paul Scholes was brought down in the box by Titus Bramble early in the half, but the referee was not positioned well enough to be able to give it. With 25 minutes to go, Alex Ferguson brought on Owen Hargreaves to shore up the defence, and Ryan Giggs, who equalled Bobby Charlton's club appearance record with his 758th appearance in a United shirt. Fittingly, it was Giggs who got United's second goal of the game, slotting the ball past Kirkland after Wayne Rooney played him in with a slide-rule pass. A last-minute equaliser by Bolton against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge ensured that United's championship did not have to be decided by goal difference, and it left the Red Devils as the champions of England for the 17th time, just one short of Liverpool's record of 18 titles.|$|E

In the vain hope of having his life spared after his capture, Atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy, but {{did not say anything}} to indicate that the plotted assassination of Johnson was merely a ruse. Conspiracy theorists point to the fact that {{on the day of the}} assassination, Booth came to the Kirkwood House and left one of <b>his</b> <b>cards.</b> This object was received by Johnson's private secretary, William A.

2500|$|Two {{very common}} {{variants}} of bidding {{are for a}} player or partnership to bid [...] "blind", without having looked at their cards, or to bid [...] "nil", stating {{that they will not}} take a single trick during play of the hand. These bids give the partnership a bonus if the player exactly meets their bid, but penalizes them if the players takes more or fewer. A combined bid of 2"blind nil" [...] is usually allowed, and is worth both the blind and nil bonuses or penalties. In some variants, the player bidding nil passes 1 or 2 of <b>his</b> <b>cards</b> (depending on the variant rules) to his partner and the partner passes an equal number of her cards back in what is considered [...] "nil passing".

2500|$|... "Dark layers", and a nuanced {{personality}} of [...] "many different levels and shades" [...] attracted Akingbola to the role. Malick has a violent streak, and is introduced after hitting his former boss, though he becomes calmer with time. A February 2011 episode saw his composure {{threatened by a}} racist patient. Akingbola appreciated the storyline for highlighting the continuation of racism and prejudice: [...] "In this country, we can feel like there's no racism and it's like a lovely Benetton advert but it's still there – that's the truth." [...] He characterised Malick as [...] "not all bad", capable of becoming [...] "a nice guy", and expanded: [...] "I think the thing with Malick is that he's young, confident and he speaks from the heart. He wears his heart on his sleeve, and I don't think there's many people like that on the ward! He doesn't care if what he says offends people, because that's what he believes. But he becomes a bit more sensitive." [...] Akingbola anticipated many [...] "twists and turns" [...] in Malick's storylines. He described him as having many secrets, and being a closed off person who [...] "keeps <b>his</b> <b>cards</b> very close to his chest." [...] Using the simile of an onion, he asserted that Malick's layers would be peeled back slowly, to reveal his [...] "wonderful heart".|$|E
