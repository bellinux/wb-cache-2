5|$|After {{serving in}} office for an extra year to 1905, Clarke retired, having helped to create a better system {{for the benefit of}} all. While the Colonial Office sought to mediate {{conflicts}} of interest, its impact was varied due to its desire to avoid expense. Milner was preoccupied with his vision of a new South Africa incorporating Southern Rhodesia, for which he needed the support of the BSAC. He appears to have had respect for Clarke, although he seems to have resented his influence at the Colonial Office, denying him an increase in salary or an official secretary. On Clarke's retirement, Milner wrote 'Personally <b>I</b> <b>hardly</b> think the office of Resident Commissioner any longer necessary'.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. <b>I</b> <b>hardly</b> even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

And as his diamondlike injunction came down upon my head, I earnestly gave myself to the task.|$|E

[...] "With Blink, I cant wait until I get done playing a song so I can say {{something}} stupid. With this band <b>I</b> <b>hardly</b> talk at all," [...] he told Las Vegas Weekly. He expounded upon this in another interview: [...] "It's a much more powerful, emotional experience than it is with Blink. To play songs and have them showcased to where it represents what this kind of music is all about is a welcome experience. It's not about anything but the music itself." ...|$|E

500|$|Fairbanks {{described}} Kingsley as [...] "an unusually permissive slave owner" [...] {{who wrote}} about the physical superiority of Africans to Europeans, armed his slaves for protection, and gave them padlocks for their cabins. Historian Daniel Stowell suggests that the cabins and Kingsley's hands-off approach to slave management was intended to prevent the slaves from running away. Kingsley himself wrote about not interfering in his slaves' family lives and [...] "encouraged {{as much as possible}} dancing, merriment and dress, for which Saturday afternoon and night, and Sunday morning were dedicated ... they were perfectly honest and obedient, and appeared quite happy, having no fear but that of offending me; and <b>I</b> <b>hardly</b> ever had occasion to apply other correction than shaming them." ...|$|E

He had to stay on until June, and read Paley's Natural Theology as well as John Herschel's Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy and Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative: these books inspired [...] "a burning zeal" [...] to research natural history. After the Beagle voyage he began development of his theory of natural selection, and in 1838 opened a notebook listing [...] "books to be read", including [...] "Paley's Nat. Theology". In 1859, on completing On the Origin of Species, he told a friend [...] "I do not think <b>I</b> <b>hardly</b> ever admired a book more than Paley's Natural Theology: I could almost formerly have said it by heart." ...|$|E

Conditions at the time were characterized by leaking tents and temperatures getting [...] "colder and colder". Hayes wrote, [...] "We were out yesterday P.M. very near to the enemy's works; were caught in the first of this storm and thoroughly soaked. <b>I</b> <b>hardly</b> expect to be dry again until the storm is over." [...] Strong winds buffeted the Burlington, New Jersey, area from early evening to midnight on September 27, uprooting trees and causing some damage to property. Further north, Boston, Massachusetts, experienced intense winds and light rainfall for about five hours starting at midnight, with no initial reports of significant destruction.|$|E

500|$|After a 20-year {{retirement}} {{from the film}} industry, O'Hara returned to the screen in 1991 to star opposite John Candy in the romantic comedy-drama Only the Lonely. She played Rose Muldoon, the domineering Irish mother of a Chicago cop (Candy), who has an indifference to Sicilians. The film reunited her with Anthony Quinn who plays her brief love interest, Nick the Greek. O'Hara stated of her return: [...] "Twenty {{years is a long}} time, but it was surprising how little changed. The equipment is lighter now, and they work a bit faster, but <b>I</b> <b>hardly</b> felt like I'd been away". She described Candy as [...] "one of my all-time favorite leading men", and was surprised by the extent of his talent, remarking that he was a [...] "comedic genius but an actor with an extraordinary dramatic talent" [...] who very much reminded her of Charles Laughton. In the following years, she continued to work, starring in several made-for-TV films, including The Christmas Box, Cab for Canada and The Last Dance, the latter her last film in which she played a retired teacher who suffers a heart attack, released on television in 2000.|$|E
500|$|In early 1942, {{the company}} that Doc Goddard worked for {{required}} him to relocate to West Virginia. California laws prevented the Goddards from taking Monroe out of state, and she faced the possibility of having {{to return to the}} orphanage. As a solution, she married their neighbors' son, 21-year-old factory worker James [...] "Jim" [...] Dougherty, on June 19, 1942, just after her 16th birthday. Monroe subsequently {{dropped out of high school}} and became a housewife; she later stated that the [...] "marriage didn't make me sad, but it didn't make me happy, either. My husband and <b>I</b> <b>hardly</b> spoke to each other. This wasn't because we were angry. We had nothing to say. I was dying of boredom." [...] In 1943, Dougherty enlisted in the Merchant Marine. He was initially stationed on Catalina Island, where she lived with him until he was shipped out to the Pacific in April 1944; he would remain there for most of the next two years. After Dougherty's deployment, Monroe moved in with his parents and began a job at the Radioplane Munitions Factory in Van Nuys, both as part of the war effort and to earn her own income.|$|E
500|$|In {{the tenth}} century, the Principality of Hungary had begun conquering Transylvania, which Hungarians had fully {{occupied}} by around 1200. The {{idea of a}} [...] "Greater Romania" [...] had existed {{in the minds of}} Romanians in Transylvania for some time and Brătianu had actively supported the concept before the war. In 1918, both Bessarabia and Bukovina voted for union with Romania. An assembly took place in the ancient city of Alba Iulia on 1 December 1918, where Vasile Goldiș read the resolution for the union of Transylvania with the Old Kingdom. This document, supported by Romanian as well as Saxon deputies, established a High National Romanian Council (...) for the province's temporary administration. Marie wrote, [...] "the dream of România Mare seems to be becoming a reality... it is all so incredible that <b>I</b> <b>hardly</b> dare believe it." [...] After the assembly, Ferdinand and Marie returned to Bucharest, where they were met by general mirth: [...] "a day of 'wild, delirious enthusiasm', with the bands crashing and the troops marching and the people cheering". Allied troops took part in the celebration and Marie was elated to see the Entente on Romanian soil for the first time.|$|E

From there, they took a train to Darmstadt, where they were greeted with great enthusiasm. Alice wrote back to her mother that [...] "I believe the people never gave so hearty a welcome", while her sister Helena wrote that [...] "nothing {{could have been more}} enthusiastic than her entry into Darmstadt was″. Alice did not adapt immediately to her new surroundings. She was homesick, and could not believe that while she was so far away from England, her father was not still alive and comforting her mother.
