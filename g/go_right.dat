25|$|Spirits or ghosts {{were said}} to fly along on a direct course close to the ground, so a {{straight}} line connecting two places was kept clear of fences, walls, and buildings to avoid obstructing the flitting spectres. The paths would run {{in a straight line}} over mountains and valleys and through marshes. In towns, they would pass the houses closely or <b>go</b> <b>right</b> through them. The paths end or originate at a cemetery; therefore, such a path or road was believed to have the same characteristics as a cemetery, where spirits of the deceased thrive.|$|E

Today's customers also pay a surcharge on their purchases, which was mandated by Congress in 1952 to make commissaries more self-sustaining. The surcharge, which has been set at 5 percent since April 1983, provides modern shopping facilities for service members at a reduced cost to taxpayers. Unlike a tax, surcharge funds <b>go</b> <b>right</b> back into the commissary to work for commissary customers, paying {{for the cost of}} building new stores, renovating and repairing existing ones and purchasing equipment and store-level information technology systems such as cash registers.|$|E

Simon once had to save Ickis from three other hunters when attempted to take sole credit for exposing monsters to the human world, though he warned Ickis that he would <b>go</b> <b>right</b> back to trying to expose them.

25|$|Carboplatin is less potent than cisplatin; {{depending}} on the strain of cancer, carboplatin may only be 1/8 to 1/45 as effective. The clinical standard of dosage of carboplatin is usually a 4:1 ratio compared to cisplatin; that is, for a dose that usually requires a particular dose of cisplatin, {{four times as much}} carboplatin is needed to achieve the same effectiveness. The stable property of carboplatin is a mixed blessing: once uptake of the drug occurs, its retention half-life is considerably longer than cisplatin, but it is also this inertness that causes carboplatin to <b>go</b> <b>right</b> through the human body, and up to 90% of the carboplatin given can be recovered in urine.|$|E
500|$|The cottage {{garden is}} {{designed}} to appear artless, rather than contrived or pretentious. Instead of artistic curves, or grand geometry, there is an artfully designed irregularity. Borders can <b>go</b> <b>right</b> up to the house, lawns are replaced with tufts of grass or flowers, and beds can be as wide as needed. Instead of the discipline of large scale color schemes, there is the simplicity of harmonious color combinations between neighbouring plants. The overall appearance can be of [...] "a vegetable garden that has {{been taken over by}} flowers." [...] The method of planting closely packed plants was supposed {{to reduce the amount of}} weeding and watering required, but planted stone pathways or turf paths, and clipped hedges overgrown with wayward vines, are cottage garden features requiring well-timed maintenance.|$|E
500|$|Similarly, Hunter Felt from PopMatters {{enjoyed the}} song, but felt {{disappointed}} by Parlophone {{and the public}} for not releasing the single in the United States, commenting [...] "'On a Night Like This', a track that is meant to <b>go</b> <b>right</b> to {{number one on the}} Billboard Club Tracks list and while being completely ignored by the general public." [...] In a review of Minogue's greatest hits album, The Best of Kylie Minogue (2012) by PopMatters' Matt James, he described [...] "On a Night Like This" [...] as a [...] "bedroom-eyed nightclubber", further adding it was [...] "still hot enough to melt large glaciers." [...] An editor from NME, Stevie Chick, believed that Minogue lacked genuine [...] "passion" [...] throughout the song and labelled it [...] "unremarkable". Billboards Jason Lipshutz felt it was [...] "more propulsive, with an even more enjoyable bridge" [...] than previous single [...] "Spinning Around".|$|E

[...] It's going to be as if you're walking into New York circa 1974: There's an art installation in the lobby, a DJ spinning your favorite records in the main room, and then the most haunting performance that you've ever seen on the stage. [...] I'm on the phone every minute of every day, talking to people, being creative, planning this Ball, and my tour manager is constantly saying, 'Come on, we have to go, we've got to <b>go</b> <b>right</b> now,' [...] But to me, the Ball is so important.

500|$|Braga {{explained}} that the most difficult casting was that for T'Pol, as they were seeking a Kim Cattrall type. Blalock and Marjorie Monaghan were among the final three {{to be considered for}} the part, with Blalock gaining the role, despite her agents rejecting requests for her to attend auditions early in the casting process. By the time that Blalock auditioned in the final group, the crew had seen hundreds of actresses according to Berman. His main issue at the time was to find a [...] "beautiful woman who can act and doesn't want to <b>go</b> <b>right</b> into feature films". Blalock was excited about the casting as she had been a lifelong Star Trek fan, with her favourite character being Spock. Bakula's casting as Archer was announced via press release on May 10, 2001. However, some of the British media mistook the announcement for Bakula taking over from Patrick Stewart. Details {{of the rest of the}} main cast were released on May 15, with the rest of the character details publicised the following day.|$|E
500|$|In a {{detailed}} review, HitFix's Melina Newman denounced its lyrical content: [...] "Even though they never are so blatant {{about it that}} booty call subtext can't <b>go</b> <b>right</b> over their tween audience's head, there's no mistaking lines like “if we get together, don’t let the pictures ever leave your phone” for anyone who's 13 or up. The lyrics are unwieldy and uncouth. That's what happens when you're not a boy, but not yet a man: One Direction can't go straight from the G-rated sweetness of “What Makes You Beautiful” to something akin to Enrique Iglesias's [...] "Tonight, I’m F****** You," [...] so instead they’re stuck with this in between clumsiness that the not-so-little girls will understand." [...] Grady Smith of Entertainment Weekly characterised it as [...] "not-so-innocent" [...] and a [...] "party jam". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard felt that its sexual suggestive lyricism [...] "arrives too soon after the more accomplished puppy-love odes of previous hits [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing" [...] to further the conversation." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, {{when asked about the}} lyrics [...] "Keep her coming every night" [...] and [...] "Sinking my fingertips into every inch of you", Levine said: [...] "Yep, that's sexual, all right. I was so sick of typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach. The little girls would enjoy them, and it would <b>go</b> <b>right</b> over my grandparents' heads. But it would hit my ex-girlfriend like a ton of bricks. It was perfect." [...] He also comments on how MTV played an edited version of the song for the music video, with the word [...] "coming" [...] edited out of the line [...] "keep her coming every night". Levine noted, [...] "MTV has now edited the language. They won't let me say, 'Keep her coming every night', and they took the sinking out of 'sinking my fingertips'. It's like communist China. It's totally bizarre." ...|$|E
500|$|Rehearsals {{began in}} January 1945; either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present. Raitt was {{presented}} with the lyrics for [...] "Soliloquy" [...] on a five-foot long sheet of paper—the piece ran nearly eight minutes. [...] Staging such a long solo number presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he {{felt that they were}} never fully addressed. [...] At some point during rehearsals, Molnár came to see what they had done to his play. [...] There are a number of variations on the story. [...] As Rodgers told it, while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Molnár {{in the rear of the}} theatre and whispered the news to his partner. [...] Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing seemed to <b>go</b> <b>right.</b> [...] At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Molnár. [...] Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, [...] "What you have done is so beautiful. [...] And you know what I like best? [...] The ending!" [...] Hammerstein wrote that Molnár became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} between November 2 and December 23, 1981. The plants used in the gardening scenes were brought inside at night {{to keep them from}} freezing. Due to the tight schedule, the cast and crew worked seven days a week with very long hours each day. Although the Australian filmmakers and the crew, who were mostly from Dallas, got along very well {{both on and off the}} set, Beresford and Duvall were at odds during the production. Beresford, in his usual approach, meticulously planned each scene, and Duvall, who preferred a free-form give-and-take on set, felt restricted by the director's methods. Although Duvall regularly acknowledged his talent as a director, he said of Beresford, [...] "He has this dictatorial way of doing things with me that just doesn't cut it. Man, I have to have my freedom." [...] Although he had no problem with Duvall's acting methodology, the actor's temperament infuriated Beresford. While filming one scene with Harper and Barkin, he became so frustrated during a phone conversation with Duvall that he said, [...] "Well if you want to direct the film, <b>go</b> <b>right</b> ahead," [...] and walked off the set. Beresford flew to New York and reportedly was ready to quit, until Duvall flew out to speak with him. After further arguments, the two made amends and returned to work on the film.|$|E

500|$|In mid-2010, {{the entire}} group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson {{suggested}} they book a studio and spend time writing. Along with Garbage's long time engineer and Manson's husband Billy Bush, the band, as Bush described, [...] "hung out for a couple weeks, drank some wine and played a bunch of music”. Three or four song ideas came together during this time. [...] "But we didn't <b>go</b> <b>right</b> into making-a-record mode", Erikson recalled. [...] "It took {{a bit of time}} for us to realize {{that we were going to}} make an album." [...] Erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process, saying that it informally began with the first phone conversations among them since their hiatus, as they discussed playing together again. After convening, and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions, they then decided to move forward with the band and embark on a full-length album. The project took off in February 2011, when Manson called Vig proposing to reunite the band and try making a new record. Manson convoked the group out of an eagerness [...] "to make loud music again". [...] "I'm a loud person", she proclaimed; [...] "I love noise and aggression. I crave contact. I needed to make that connection again. I think we all did. To get something back up when there was absolutely no momentum took a Herculean effort on everybody's part. It's like pulling yourself out of mud. Even to stand back up and say 'we're going to take another swing at this' was a scary feeling, and I'm proud of us for trying. It's much easier to stay at home.” ...|$|E
500|$|On February 1, 2008, Bako {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with an invitation to spring training with the Cincinnati Reds. At the end of spring training, he {{was added to the}} 40-man roster. Though he batted only [...]217, Bako appeared in a career-high 99 games in 2008, hitting six home runs and notching 35 RBIs. On January 30, 2009, the Chicago Cubs signed Bako to a one-year contract. However, he was unconditionally released near the end of spring training. On May 18, Bako signed {{a minor league}} deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, and was called up from the Reading Phillies to the Major League roster on June 9. He became the Phillies only backup catcher when the Phillies waived [...] "folk hero" [...] Chris Coste on July 10; Coste had broken into the big leagues {{for the first time with}} Philadelphia at age 33. The next day, Bako came to the plate in the bottom of the ninth inning against Pittsburgh Pirates closer Matt Capps with the score tied, 7–7; the Phillies had been behind by four runs before home runs by Matt Stairs and Ryan Howard tied the game. With the bases loaded, Bako hit a single through the left side of the infield, driving in the winning run (Raúl Ibañez) and sealing the Phillies fourth consecutive victory in a season-high ten-game winning streak. After the acquisition of starting pitcher Cliff Lee, Bako caught all of his first five starts with the Phillies, when Lee posted a 5–0 record and an 0.68 earned run average. Bako said, [...] "With as many strikes as he throws and as many weapons as he has, it's a lot of fun to catch him." [...] Manager Charlie Manuel, however, denied that Bako was scheduled to be Lee's personal catcher, as he had done for Maddux in 2001. [...] "'s [...] not his personal catcher... Of course you guys will write whatever you want to write. If you want him to be his personal catcher, <b>go</b> <b>right</b> ahead. But I'll handle it anyway, so it doesn't matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Kirkwood branded Mercedes [...] "a savvy, ballsy {{girl that}} can't say no and is unapologetic about it". Metcalfe has {{described}} Mercedes {{as someone who}} [...] "hates every woman in Hollyoaks" [...] except her own sisters, and as someone who talks too much and has a [...] "mouth like a foghorn". She {{went on to say}} that Mercedes [...] "always looks after her family and would never do anything to deliberately hurt them. Mercedes' heart is definitely in the right place". Metcalfe observed that Mercedes is [...] "completely mad" [...] and she [...] "just does whatever she feels like doing at the time. She doesn't exactly think things through". Metcalfe further explained that Mercedes did not [...] "consider consequences", which led her to unintentionally [...] "destroy everything". She elaborated on this, saying that Mercedes never has a happy ending [...] "because she can't. I don't think with Mercedes there is ever a happy ending. Just when something might go her way or something's going to <b>go</b> <b>right</b> for her, she destroys it". She said that her character is [...] "used to getting her own way" [...] so she thought that despite her actions, [...] "everything will turn out right in the end". She opined that Mercedes was at her best in this state, being [...] "minxy and destructive". Metcalfe described Mercedes in this way: [...] "Whatever she does that's bad, she manages to justify in her head. She doesn't have much self-worth and she knows what she's like". Metcalfe also expressed the hope that Mercedes could be happy [...] "free and single". She explained that Mercedes was unable to remain happy, saying: [...] "she has moments of happiness but ruins them herself". She went on to explain that due to Mercedes' first love having [...] "messed her up", Mercedes behaved [...] "the way she is where men are concerned". She further explained that Mercedes believed she could change but was disappointed when she could not. Metcalfe said, [...] "When she says that she's going to change, she actually means it; she just can't sustain it." ...|$|E
