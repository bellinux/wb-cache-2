5|$|When Universal {{cancelled}} King Kong in 1997, Jackson and Walsh immediately received {{support from}} Weinstein {{and began a}} six-week process of sorting out the rights. Jackson and Walsh asked Costa Botes to write a synopsis {{of the book and}} they began to re-read the book. Two to three months later, they had written their treatment. The first film would have dealt with what would become , , and the beginning of , ending with Saruman's death, and Gandalf and Pippin going to Minas Tirith. In this treatment, Gwaihir and Gandalf visit Edoras after escaping Saruman, Gollum attacks Frodo when the Fellowship is still united, and Farmer Maggot, Glorfindel, Radagast, Elladan and Elrohir are present. Bilbo attends the Council of Elrond, Sam looks into Galadriel's mirror, Saruman is redeemed before he dies and the Nazgûl <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> into Mount Doom before they fall. They presented their treatment to Harvey and Bob Weinstein, the latter of whom they focused on impressing with their screenwriting as he had not read the book. They agreed upon two films and a total budget of $75million.|$|E
25|$|While {{wandering}} around New Orleans before a show with Dockstader's Minstrels, he enters a small club {{where a group}} of black jazz musicians are performing. Jolson has a revelation, that the staid repertoire of the minstrel troupe can be transformed by actually playing black music in blackface. He tells Dockstader that he wants to sing what he has just experienced: 'I heard some music tonight, something they call jazz. Some fellows <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> up as they go along. They pick it up out of the air.' After Dockstader refuses to accommodate Jolson's revolutionary concept, the narrative chronicles his climb to stardom as he allegedly injects jazz into his blackface performances … Jolson's success is built on anticipating what Americans really want. Dockstader performs the inevitable function of the guardian of the status quo, whose hidebound commitment to what is about to become obsolete reinforces the audience's sympathy with the forward-looking hero.|$|E

500|$|Preliminary {{designer}} Dick Scherrer requested possible shapes {{upon which}} he could base his low radar cross-section (RCS) design. He was introduced to Denys Overholser, who recommended an aircraft with flat surfaces. Overholser later recounted his discussion with Sherrer: [...] "When Dick Scherrer asked me ... I said 'Well, it's simple, you <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> out of flat surfaces, and tilt those flat surfaces over, sweeping the edges away from the radar view angle, and that way you basically cause the energy to reflect away from the radar.'" [...] Scherrer subsequently drew a preliminary low-RCS aircraft with faceted surfaces. At the same time, Overholser hired mathematician Bill Schroeder, {{with whom he had}} a prior working relationship – in fact, it was Schroeder who trained Overholser on mathematics relating to stealth aircraft. Kenneth Watson was hired as the senior lead aircraft designer.|$|E

However, according to Maxtone-Graham, the writing staff decided to cut it because [...] "it just never played anything but sad." [...] He added that the writers [...] "really wanted to address how [...] would feel" [...] but they [...] "could never pull it off without it just being sad."

The film's settings vary in cities throughout the United States, which Cyrus thought she could capture in the song. [...] "Not <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> something that sounds from Hollywood and really produced, but we could add a little country twang to it," [...] she said. Cyrus said the writing process was easy. Before the song's completion, Travolta agreed to sing it, believing [...] "Well, it will be a cute song, whatever it is." [...] After listening to the song, he was surprised at Cyrus' songwriting abilities.
