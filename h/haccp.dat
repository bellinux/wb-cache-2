These improvements included refurbishing the production line equipment, including higher performing mixers and belts and a new bottle conveyor system. The Coca-Cola Company issued international <b>HACCP</b> certification to Star Breweries in 2010, confirming its adherence to international quality standards in beverage production. In 2011, Coca-Cola also awarded Star Breweries the Gold Medal among 27 competing African countries for the company's standards of quality and environmental protection {{in the production of}} its beer and other beverages. Frequent brownouts resulting from the overtaxed national power grid produce power cuts to the THB breweries that have negatively affected the volume and cost effectiveness of production since the early 2000s.|$|E
25|$|Verification {{ensures the}} <b>HACCP</b> plan is adequate, that is, working as intended. Verification {{procedures}} may include such activities as review of <b>HACCP</b> plans, CCP records, critical limits and microbial sampling and analysis. FSIS is requiring that the <b>HACCP</b> plan include verification tasks {{to be performed}} by plant personnel. Verification tasks would also be performed by FSIS inspectors. Both FSIS and industry will undertake microbial testing as one of several verification activities.|$|E
25|$|<b>HACCP</b> was {{initially}} set on three principles, now shown as principles one, two, and {{four in the}} section below. Pillsbury quickly adopted two more principles, numbers three and five, to its own company in 1975. It was further supported by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) that governmental inspections by the FDA go from reviewing plant records to compliance with its <b>HACCP</b> system. A second proposal by the NAS {{led to the development}} of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF) in 1987. NACMCF {{was initially}} responsible for defining HACCP's systems and guidelines for its application and were coordinated with the Codex Committee for Food Hygiene, that led to reports starting in 1992 and further harmonization in 1997. By 1997, the seven <b>HACCP</b> principles listed below became the standard. A year earlier, the American Society for Quality offered their first certifications for <b>HACCP</b> Auditors. (First known as Certified Quality Auditor-HACCP, they were changed to Certified <b>HACCP</b> Auditor (CHA) in 2004.).|$|E
25|$|The seven <b>HACCP</b> {{principles}} {{are included in}} the international standard ISO 22000 FSMS 2011. This standard is a complete food safety and quality management system incorporating the elements of prerequisite programmes(GMP & SSOP), <b>HACCP</b> and the quality management system, which together form an organization's Total Quality Management system.|$|E
25|$|Validation {{ensures that}} the plants do what they were {{designed}} to do; that is, they are successful in ensuring the production of a safe product. Plants will be required to validate their own <b>HACCP</b> plans. FSIS will not approve <b>HACCP</b> plans in advance, but will review them for conformance with the final rule.|$|E
25|$|Training for {{developing}} and implementing <b>HACCP</b> food safety management system are offered by several quality assurance companies.|$|E
25|$|The <b>HACCP</b> {{regulation}} {{requires that}} all plants maintain certain documents, including its hazard analysis and written <b>HACCP</b> plan, and records documenting the monitoring of critical control points, critical limits, verification activities, and {{the handling of}} processing deviations. Implementation involves monitoring, verifying, and validating of the daily work that is compliant with regulatory requirements in all stages all the time. The differences among those three types of work are given by Saskatchewan Agriculture and Food.|$|E
25|$|Hazards {{associated}} with water systems in buildings include physical, chemical and microbial hazards. In 2013, NSF International, {{a public health}} and safety NGO, established education, training and certification programs in <b>HACCP</b> for building water systems. The programs, developed with the guidance of subject matter experts Aaron Rosenblatt and William McCoy center on the use of <b>HACCP</b> principles adapted to the specific requirements of domestic (hot and cold) and utility (HVAC, etc.) water systems in buildings, to prevent plumbing-associated hazards from harming people. Hazards addressed include scalding, lead, and disinfection byproducts as well as a range of clinically important pathogens, such as Legionella, Pseudomonas, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), Acinetobacter, Elizabethkingia, and Naegleria. Early adopters of <b>HACCP</b> for building water systems include leading healthcare institutions, notably Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.|$|E
25|$|Verification also {{includes}} 'validation' – {{the process of}} finding evidence for {{the accuracy of the}} <b>HACCP</b> system (e.g. scientific evidence for critical limitations).|$|E
25|$|<b>HACCP</b> {{expanded}} in all realms {{of the food}} industry, going into meat, poultry, seafood, dairy, and has spread now from the farm to the fork.|$|E
25|$|Monitoring {{activities}} {{are necessary to}} ensure that the process is under control at each critical control point. In the United States, the FSIS requires that each monitoring procedure and its frequency be listed in the <b>HACCP</b> plan.|$|E
25|$|Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{issued a}} rule in 2001 {{requiring}} {{that virtually all}} fruit and vegetable juice producers follow <b>HACCP</b> controls, and mandating a 5-log reduction in pathogens, UVGI has seen some use in sterilization of juices such as fresh-pressed apple cider.|$|E
25|$|Other standards, such as Safe Quality Food Institute's SQF Code, also relies {{upon the}} <b>HACCP</b> {{methodology}} {{as the basis}} for developing and maintaining food safety (level 2) and food quality (level 3) plans and programs in concert with the fundamental prerequisites of good manufacturing practices.|$|E
25|$|These are {{actions to}} be taken when {{monitoring}} indicates a deviation from an established critical limit. The final rule requires a plant's <b>HACCP</b> plan to identify the corrective actions {{to be taken}} if a critical limit is not met. Corrective actions are intended to ensure that no product is injurious to health or otherwise adulterated as a result if the deviation enters commerce.|$|E
25|$|ISO 22000 is a {{standard}} designed to help augment <b>HACCP</b> on issues related to food safety. Although several companies, especially big ones, have either implemented or are {{on the point of}} implementing ISO 22000, there are many others which are hesitant to do so. The main reason behind that is the lack of information and the fear that the new standard is too demanding in terms of bureaucratic work.|$|E
2500|$|<b>HACCP</b> is {{believed}} to stem from a production process monitoring used during World War II because traditional [...] "end of the pipe" [...] testing on artillery shell's firing mechanisms could not be performed, and {{a large percentage of}} the artillery shells made at the time were either duds or misfiring. <b>HACCP</b> itself was conceived in the 1960s when the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) asked Pillsbury to design and manufacture the first foods for space flights. Since then, <b>HACCP</b> has been recognized internationally as a logical tool for adapting traditional inspection methods to a modern, science-based, food safety system. Based on risk-assessment, <b>HACCP</b> plans allow both industry and government to allocate their resources efficiently in establishing and auditing safe food production practices. In 1994, the organization of International <b>HACCP</b> Alliance was established initially for the US meat and poultry industries to assist them with implementing <b>HACCP</b> and now its membership has been spread over other professional/industrial areas.|$|E
2500|$|The use of <b>HACCP</b> {{for water}} quality {{management}} was first proposed nearly 20 years ago. Thereafter, {{a number of}} water quality initiatives applied <b>HACCP</b> principles and steps to the control of infectious disease from water, and {{provided the basis for}} the Water Safety Plan (WSP) approach in the third edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) report, which has been described as [...] "a way of adapting the <b>HACCP</b> approach to drinking water systems".|$|E
2500|$|Hence, <b>HACCP</b> {{has been}} {{increasingly}} applied to industries other than food, such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. This method, which in effect seeks to plan out unsafe practices based on science, differs from traditional [...] "produce and sort" [...] quality control methods that {{do nothing to}} prevent hazards from occurring and must identify them {{at the end of}} the process. <b>HACCP</b> is focused only on the health safety issues of a product and not the quality of the product, yet <b>HACCP</b> principles are the basis of most food quality and safety assurance systems. In the United States, <b>HACCP</b> compliance is regulated by 21 CFR part 120 and 123. Similarly, FAO/WHO published a guideline for all governments to handle the issue in small and less developed food businesses.|$|E

2500|$|Hazard {{analysis}} and critical control points or <b>HACCP</b> (...) is a systematic preventive approach to food safety from biological, chemical, and physical hazards in production processes {{that can cause}} the finished product to be unsafe, and designs measurements to reduce these risks to a safe level. In this manner, <b>HACCP</b> attempts to avoid hazards rather than attempting to inspect finished products {{for the effects of}} those hazards. The <b>HACCP</b> system can be used at all stages of a food chain, from food production and preparation processes including packaging, distribution, etc. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) require mandatory <b>HACCP</b> programs for juice and meat as an effective approach to food safety and protecting public health. Meat <b>HACCP</b> systems are regulated by the USDA, while seafood and juice are regulated by the FDA. All other food companies in the United States that are required to register with the FDA under the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, as well as firms outside the US that export food to the US, are transitioning to mandatory hazard {{analysis and}} risk-based preventive controls (HARPC) plans.|$|E

2500|$|Soon, Pillsbury {{was confronted}} with a food safety issue of its own when glass {{contamination}} was found in farina, a cereal commonly used in infant food. Baumann's leadership promoted <b>HACCP</b> in Pillsbury for producing commercial foods, and applied to its own food production. This led to a panel discussion at the 1971 National Conference on Food Protection that included examining CCPs and good manufacturing practices in producing safe foods. Several botulism cases were attributed to under-processed low-acid canned foods in 1970–71. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asked Pillsbury to organize and conduct a training program on the inspection of canned foods for FDA inspectors. This 21-day program was first held in September 1972 with 11 days of classroom lecture and 10 days of canning plant evaluations. Canned food regulations (21 CFR 108, 21 CFR 110, 21 CFR 113, and 21 CFR 114) were first published in 1969. Pillsbury's training program to the FDA in 1969, titled [...] "Food Safety through the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point System", {{was the first time}} that <b>HACCP</b> was used.|$|E
2500|$|NASA's own {{requirements}} for critical control points (CCP) in engineering management {{would be used}} as a guide for food safety. CCP derived from failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) from NASA via the munitions industry to test weapon and engineering system reliability. Using that information, NASA and Pillsbury required contractors to identify [...] "critical failure areas" [...] and eliminate them from the system, a first in the food industry then. Baumann, a microbiologist by training, was so pleased with Pillsbury's experience in the space program that he advocated for his company to adopt what would become <b>HACCP</b> at Pillsbury.|$|E
