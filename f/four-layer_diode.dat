5000|$|While {{work on the}} {{transistors}} continued, Shockley {{hit upon}} {{the idea of using}} a four-layer device (transistors are three) that would have the novel quality of locking into the [...] "on" [...] or [...] "off" [...] state with no further control inputs. Similar circuits required several transistors, typically three, so for large switching networks the new diodes would greatly reduce complexity. The <b>four-layer</b> <b>diode</b> is now called the Shockley diode.|$|E
5000|$|Shockley {{never managed}} to make the <b>four-layer</b> <b>diode</b> a {{commercial}} success, in spite of eventually working out the technical details and entering production in the 1960s. The introduction of integrated circuits allowed the multiple transistors needed to produce a switch {{to be placed on}} a single [...] "chip", thereby nullifying the parts-count advantage of Shockley's design. However, the company did have a number of other successful projects, including the first strong theoretical study of solar cells, developing the seminal Shockley-Queisser limit that places an upper limit of 30% efficiency on basic silicon solar cells.|$|E
5000|$|The Shockley diode (named after {{physicist}} William Shockley) is a <b>four-layer</b> semiconductor <b>diode,</b> {{which was}} one of the first semiconductor devices invented. It was a [...] "pnpn" [...] diode. It is equivalent to a thyristor with a disconnected gate.Shockley Diodes where manufactured and marketed by Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in the late 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|Last {{worked at}} the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory {{division}} of Beckman Instruments from April 1956 to September 1957. Shockley insisted on supervising each scientist individually, {{with little or no}} communication between group members. Last spent much of his time working on basis surface properties of materials, trying to explain anomalous results from <b>four-layer</b> silicon <b>diodes.</b> Last credits Shockley as being [...] "an extraordinary, brilliant man." [...] "He made right decisions. He hired a good group of people... It was the right technology, the right material, the right group of people to implement it, and wham." [...] However, Shockley was not skilled at working with people, and his relationships with employees in the company deteriorated rapidly. In January 1957, a group of seven employees, including Last, appealed to Arnold Beckman to ask that he intervene in the company's operations. Beckman initially seemed sympathetic, but ended up supporting Shockley.|$|R
