2500|$|Cleaning {{laboratory}} glassware is sometimes necessary {{and may be}} done using multiple methods. [...] Glassware can be soaked in a <b>detergent</b> <b>solution</b> to remove grease and loosen most contaminations. These contaminations are then scrubbed with a brush or scouring pad to remove particles which cannot be rinsed. Sturdy glassware {{may be able to}} withstand sonicated as an alternative to scrubbing. For certain sensitive experiments glassware may be soaked in solvents, such as aqua regia or mild acids, to dissolve a trace quantities of specific contaminations known to interfere with an experiment. When cleaning is finished it is common practice to triple rinse glassware before suspending it upside down on drying racks.|$|E

40|$|The {{general health}} {{problems}} of detergents {{with emphasis on}} the weight, hematology and histopathology were investigated by ingesting 20 mice (about 30 days old) with <b>detergent</b> <b>solutions.</b> The mice were grouped into five sets, comprising of five mice each. The control group (group 1) was given ordinary water while groups 2 - 5 were given 25, 50, 75 and 100 % v/v of the <b>detergent</b> <b>solutions,</b> respectively as the only sources of water. The mice had access to feed (F. A Feeds, Lagos) ad libitum in suspended, meshed-bottom cages for about 4 weeks. The Relative Growth Rate (RGR) in percentage of the control mice was 7. 1 while the RGR of the mice exposed to 25, 50, 75 and 100 % v/v of the <b>detergent</b> <b>solutions</b> were - 33. 2, - 43. 9, - 52. 5 and - 59. 3, respectively. A significant difference (p< 0. 05) exists between the mean weight of the control mice and the mean weights of the mice placed on the different concentrations of the detergent. The hematology analysis of the exposed mice showed marked reduction in the packed cell volume, hemoglobin, white blood cells, red blood cells and total protein. Furthermore, {{the blood of the}} exposed mice had dose-dependent hypochromasia, macrocytosis, microcytosis, eosinophilia and arisocytosis. A significant difference (p< 0. 05) also exists between the mean blood parameters of the control mice and the mean blood parameters of the mice exposed to the various concentrations of the detergent. The internal organs (heart, kidney, liver and reproductive organs) of the exposed mice showed marked histological changes compared to the control mice and the extent of the injuries increased with the concentrations of the <b>detergent</b> <b>solutions.</b> The results of the research highlight health hazards of detergent exposure and underscore the needs for proper handling and disposal of detergents...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Understanding {{membrane}} protein folding and stability {{is required for}} a molecular explanation of function and {{for the development of}} interventions in {{membrane protein}} folding diseases. Stable aqueous <b>detergent</b> <b>solutions</b> of the Escherichia coli glycerol facilitator in its native oligomeric state have been difficult to prepare as the protein readily unfolds and forms nonspecific aggregates. Here, we report a study of the structure and stability of the glycerol facilitator in several <b>detergent</b> <b>solutions</b> by Blue Native and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), circular dichroism (CD), and fluorescence. Protein tetramers were prepared in neutral dodecyl maltoside (DDM) and in zwitterionic lysomyristoylphosphatidylcholine (LMPC) <b>detergent</b> <b>solutions</b> that are stable during SDS-PAGE. Thermal unfolding experiments show that the protein is more stable in LMPC than in DDM. Tertiary structure unfolds before quaternary and some secondary structure in LMPC, whereas unfolding is more cooperative in DDM. The high stability of the protein in DDM is evident from the unfolding half-life of 8 days in 8 M urea, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions contribute to the stability. The protein unfolds readily in LMPC below pH 6, whereas the tetramer remains intact at pH 4 in DDM. At pH 4 in DDM, the protein is more sensitive than at neutral pH to unfolding by SDS and the effect is reversible. At pH 3 in DDM, the tetramer unfolds, losing its tertiary structure but retaining native helical structure which melt...|$|R

The precise density {{measurement of the}} antenna solutions provided {{the values of the}} buoyant factor of both complexes. Phospholipid content was measured in both antennae. Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium centrifugation indicated that the B 800 – 850 sample is monodisperse and composed from heptamers (α/β/ 3 Bacteriochlorophyll α 1. 3 Carotenoid) 7. B 875 is not monodisperse but analysis of equilibrium centrifugation indicated that its smallest oligomer is a dodecamer (α/β/ 2 BChlα/ 2 hydroxyspheroidene) 12; larger oligomers probably coexist.

B 800 – 850 binds about 0. 4 – 0. 5 g of lauryl-dimethyl-amine oxide per g of protein (i. e., 28 – 35 detergent molecules per αβ) while a large amount of detergent (2. 3 g of decanoylsucrose per g of protein, i. e., 64 detergent molecules per αβ) is bound to 13875.

5000|$|Performing an ELISA {{involves}} {{at least}} one antibody with specificity for a particular antigen. The sample with an unknown amount of antigen is immobilized on a solid support (usually a polystyrene microtiter plate) either non-specifically (via adsorption to the surface) or specifically (via capture by another antibody specific to the same antigen, in a [...] "sandwich" [...] ELISA). After the antigen is immobilized, the detection antibody is added, forming a complex with the antigen. The detection antibody can be covalently linked to an enzyme, or can itself be detected by a secondary antibody that is linked to an enzyme through bioconjugation. Between each step, the plate is typically washed with a mild <b>detergent</b> <b>solution</b> to remove any proteins or antibodies that are non-specifically bound.

The {{aim of this}} study was to identify effective methods of pre-treatment that would increase palynomorph yields using the (NaPO 3) 6 method. Pre-treatment generally increased the mass of sample that was broken down by the (NaPO 3) 6 technique. Detergent one (carpet cleaner), formic acid, household bleach and white spirit allowed the disaggregation of more rock than without any pre-treatment. However, formic acid produced a lower concentration of Carboniferous miospores than with no pre-treatment. Pre-treatment with acetone, detergent two (industrial detergent) and methylated spirits actually decreased the weight of rock that was disaggregated with (NaPO 3) 6. Despite this, all these three pre-treatments improved the palynomorph yield as compared to with no pre-treatment. Moreover, all the pre-treatments except formic acid improved palynomorph productivity. The effectiveness of pre-treatments was demonstrated by the increased absolute numbers of indigenous palynomorphs extracted. However, the concentrations of miospores per gram of rock are more significant.
