25|$|German {{physicist}} Johann Hittorf {{concluded that}} ion movement caused electric current. In 1853 Hittorf noticed that some ions traveled {{more rapidly than}} others. This observation led {{to the concept of}} transport number, the rate at which particular ions carried the electric current. Hittorf measured the changes in the concentration of <b>electrolysed</b> solutions, computed from these the transport numbers (relative carrying capacities) of many ions, and, in 1869, published his findings governing the migration of ions.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} {{of water in}} a solution of sodium chloride must be examined in respect to its reduction and oxidation in both electrodes. Usually, water is <b>electrolysed</b> as mentioned in electrolysis of water yielding gaseous oxygen in the anode and gaseous hydrogen in the cathode. On the other hand, sodium chloride in water dissociates in Na+ and Cl− ions, cation, which is the positive ion, will be attracted to the cathode (-), thus reducing the sodium ion. The anion will then be attracted to the anode (+) oxidizing chloride ion.|$|E
25|$|Another {{problem with}} Volta's {{batteries}} was short battery life (an hour's worth at best), which {{was caused by}} two phenomena. The first was that the current produced <b>electrolysed</b> the electrolyte solution, resulting in a film of hydrogen bubbles forming on the copper, which steadily increased the internal resistance of the battery (this effect, called polarization, is counteracted in modern cells by additional measures). The other was a phenomenon called local action, wherein minute short-circuits would form around impurities in the zinc, causing the zinc to degrade. The latter problem was solved in 1835 by William Sturgeon, who found that amalgamated zinc, whose surface had been treated with some mercury, didn't suffer from local action.|$|E

Removal of ammonium, phosphate, nitrite and nitrate from paper mill effluents was investigated by different current intensity, electrodes (Al and Fe) and <b>electrolyse</b> time.

From the experiments carried out at 12 V. and at a current intensity of 77, 13 mA, it was found that two minutes are sufficient for the removal of the pollutants (except for nitrate) using either electrodes.

For silent and sonoelectrolyses processes, cleaning/reactivation of the BDD surface by acetonitrile and/or electrochemical treatment was necessary. The pulsed sonolectrolysis were carried out purposely without cleaning/reactivation of the surface. The results showed greater PCP degradation for insonated studies than those obtained for the silent <b>electrolyses,</b> due to the increase of mass transport, minimization of the electrode fouling and the combined generation of hydroxyl radicals by both ultrasound and the polarized BDD surface.
