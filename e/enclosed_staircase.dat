25|$|Janet and Van Korrell {{purchased}} {{the house when}} the Cannons left in 1992. Janet had been fascinated with the Frank Lloyd Wright designed house for some time, and they quickly tore off the <b>enclosed</b> <b>staircase</b> that the Suttons had added 50 years earlier {{to get up to}} the balcony on the back. Determined to restore it as fully as possible, in 1999 they hired John G. Thorpe to oversee the work. Thorpe, a Wright expert, restoration architect, and {{one of the founders of}} the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust in Oak Park, Illinois, worked with the original plans and old photos on a complete restoration inside and out, including the Wright-designed cupboards, the ground-level entry, and the daring cantilevered veranda roof. As part of this work, the Korrells elected to build an addition in the previously open northwest corner, balancing the original northeast corner bedroom but moving away from Wright's cruciform design. This addition incorporates a modern laundry and a second stairway to the basement.|$|E
50|$|The {{house was}} built in 1849 to house the large Butterfield family. All work was done by local craftsmen, with the cobblestones brought south from Lake Ontario.

50|$|The Devil's Farmhouse {{was built}} in the 18th century during the rule of the Knights Hospitallers {{to be used as a}} horse stable. It is found in an area known as Ta' Randa very close to L-Ghar ta' Zamberat (Ta' Zamberat's Cave). The {{farmhouse}} stands away from urban development in isolation. Attributed to the farmhouse is a Maltese myth that the farmhouse was built by the devil (or devils) in one day (or three days). The only architectural feature that gives the impression of relating to demonic icons are the two <b>enclosed</b> <b>staircases,</b> that lead to the roof of the stable, which are suggested to appear as two horns.|$|R
5|$|As {{with the}} rest of the Hudson Line, the Scarborough station became a Penn Central station once the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads merged in 1968. Penn Central's {{continuous}} financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The station and the railroad were turned over to Conrail in 1976, and eventually became part of the MTA's Metro-North Railroad in 1983. In 2007, the MTA overhauled the station, installing new systems such as platforms, canopies, shelters, <b>enclosed</b> <b>staircases,</b> lighting, and benches. The station's overpass was demolished and a replacement was built with elevators on either side. The new overpass was designed in a less modern style and now has glass-sided elevators. During the construction, Metro-North built a temporary wooden station to the station's south.|$|R
