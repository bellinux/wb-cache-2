5|$|The Belgians much {{preferred}} {{an alliance}} with the United Kingdom. The British had entered the First World War {{in response to the}} German violation of Belgian neutrality. The Belgian Channel ports had offered the German Imperial Navy valuable bases, and such an attack would offer the German Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe bases to engage in strategic offensive operations against the United Kingdom in the coming conflict. But the British government paid little attention to the concerns of the Belgians. The lack of this commitment ensured the Belgian withdrawal from the Western Alliance, the day before the remilitarisation of the Rhineland. The lack of opposition to the remilitarisation served to convince the Belgians that France and Britain were unwilling to fight for their own strategic interests, let alone Belgium's. The Belgian General Staff was determined to fight for <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests,</b> alone if necessary.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the war, the Swiss {{troops were}} no longer bound along the Rhine and in the Grisons. The cantons {{concluded}} new mercenary contracts, so called capitulations, with the Duchy of Milan and soon got deeply involved in the Italian Wars, where Swiss mercenaries ended up fighting on both sides. The involvement of the Old Swiss Confederacy, acting in <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> in these wars, was brought to an end by the defeat against French forces in the battle of Marignano in 1515 and a subsequent peace treaty with the French king in 1516, the so-called Eternal Peace. However, Swiss mercenaries from individual cantons of the federation continued to participate in the Italian Wars well beyond (until the middle of the 16th century) in the service of various parties and, following that peace with France, in particular {{in the service of the}} French king.|$|E

25|$|Protestantism {{is largely}} a result of Dutch Reformed and Lutheran missionary efforts during the country's colonial period.

Although these two branches are the most common, a multitude of other denominations can be found elsewhere in Indonesia.

25|$|Protestantism {{is largely}} a result of Dutch Reformed and Lutheran missionary efforts during the country's colonial period. The Dutch Reformed Church was long at the {{forefront}} in introducing Christianity to Indonesians, and was later joined by other Reformed churches that separated from it during the 19th century. The Dutch East India Company regulated the missionary work so it could serve <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> and restricted it to {{the eastern part of}} the Indonesian archipelago.

25|$|However, the English obstructionism, also in {{the matter}} of the peace with Portugal (which Downing helped to {{frustrate}} for a long time) actually helped in the end to unify the Dutch politicians behind De Witt. The Amsterdam regents, seeing that they did not get anywhere with Charles, lost interest in the cause of the Prince. Holland therefore reunited, and the recalcitrant provinces had no chance against a united Holland. Zeeland was brought back in the fold by the aggressive behavior of the new Royal African Company (RAC) against the WIC (in which Zeeland traditionally had an important interest) in West Africa. This threat to <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> by the English (and especially William's royal uncles) helped cool Zeeland's fervor for the Orangist cause in 1661.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese {{introduced}} Catholicism to Indonesia, notably to {{the island}} of Flores and to {{what was to become}} East Timor. Protestantism was first introduced by the Dutch in the sixteenth century with Calvinist and Lutheran influences. For the Dutch, economic benefit rather than religious conversion were paramount and missionary efforts avoided predominantly Muslim areas such as Java. The Dutch East India Company regulated the missionary work so it could serve <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> and restricted it to {{the eastern part of the}} Indonesian archipelago. Animist areas in eastern Indonesia, on the other hand, were the main focus Dutch conversion efforts, including Maluku, North Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, Papua and Kalimantan. Later, Christianity spread from the coastal ports of Borneo and missionaries arrived among the Torajans on Sulawesi. Parts of Sumatra were also targeted, most notably the Batak people, who are predominantly Protestant today.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, it {{was only}} in 1971 that the Portuguese {{government}} gave priority to the procurement of new fighters and approved a new rearmament plan for the purchase of 64 fighters, 28 of which would be for the defense of mainland Portugal and 36 to be deployed overseas. This plan called for an initial order of 30 aircraft (27 single-seat and three twin-seat). At the time Portugal was under a United Nations arms embargo and the United States was against the Portuguese colonial war and Portugal's presence in Africa, having even previously put limitations on the use of Portuguese F-86F Sabre fighters in Africa. Meanwhile, France saw a Portuguese presence in Africa as coinciding with <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> and had become, between 1964 and 1971, in the largest supplier of weapons to Portugal. As such, the Dassault Mirage was seen as the best option.|$|E
25|$|Two revolutionary {{movements}} {{started to}} develop {{in the beginning of}} the 1870s: the Internal Revolutionary Organisation and the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee. Their armed struggle reached its peak with the April Uprising which broke out in 1876. It resulted in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, and led to the foundation of the third Bulgarian state after the Treaty of San Stefano. The treaty set up a Principality Bulgaria which territory included the wide area between the Danube and the Balkan mountain range, most of today Eastern Serbia, Northern Thrace, parts of Eastern Thrace and nearly all of Macedonia. At that time the clergy's shifts from the Orthodox to the Catholic Church and vice versa were symptomatic of the foreign powers' game that the clergy got involved after the 1878 Berlin Treaty, that partitioned the stipulated territory of the new Principality. Thus, in the interplay between the Orthodox and the Uniat doctrine, Bulgaria supported the Orthodox Exarchate. Russia supported Bulgaria. The Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople supported the Greek national idea. France and the Habsburg Empire supported the Uniats. The Ottoman Empire's attitude was depending on how it had to balance <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> in the game with the Great Powers.|$|E

25|$|Louis XIV's {{first act}} was an {{official}} recognition of Philip V's {{place in the}} French line of succession by proclaiming {{the doctrine of the}} divine right of kings. This gave rise to the spectre of France and Spain uniting under a single monarch, a direct contradiction of Charles II's will. Next, in early February 1701 Louis XIV moved to secure the Bourbon succession in the Spanish Netherlands and sent French troops to take over the Dutch-held 'Barrier' fortresses that William III had secured at the Peace of Ryswick. The Spanish Netherlands were of vital strategic interest to the Dutch as they acted as a buffer zone between France and the Republic. But the French incursion was also detrimental to Dutch commercial interests in the region as there was now no prospect of keeping the Scheldt trade restrictions in place – restrictions that up till now had ensured the Republic's position as the primary inlet and outlet for European trade. England also had <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> in the Spanish Netherlands, and ministers recognised the potential danger posed by an enemy established to the east of the Strait of Dover who, taking advantage of favourable wind and tide, could threaten the British Isles. The French move was designed in part to pressure the States General of the Netherlands into recognising Philip as King of Spain – which they soon did – but from William III's perspective, losing the hard-won securities overturned the work of the last twenty years.|$|E

Richard Hovannisian wrote that because the [...] "Russian armies were in firm control of most of the Armenian plateau by the summer of 1916, there was no longer any need to expend niceties upon the Armenians". According to Tsatur Aghayan, Russia used the Armenian volunteers for <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests.</b> Andranik and other Armenian volunteers, disappointed by the Russian policy, left the front in July 1916.|$|E
