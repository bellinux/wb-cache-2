Corresponding structural vibration characteristics were then analyzed based on two-way coupled Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) method. Fluid results showed that flow in the outlet flow passage {{was a combination of}} the axial flow and circumferential rotation motion. Time and frequency domain analysis of pressure pulsation of typical measure points indicated that larger pulsation amplitudes appeared in the tip of the blades and the main vibration source was the pressure pulsation induced by rotation of the blades. The fluid pulsation amplitudes decreased gradually along the flow direction, which can be ascribed to the function of <b>fixed</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane.</b> Structural analysis of the blades in both pressure and suction side indicated that significant stress concentration was formed at the blade and hub connection near the leading edge. Maximum effective stress of the blades varied periodically, so prevention measures of the fatigue of blades should be taken.

Numerical results show that the stalling phenomenon on a ring-type Wells turbine occurs at a flow coefficient of ϕ =  0. 36, and its peak efficiency can reach 0. 54, which is 16 % higher than that of an unmodified turbine and 9 % higher than {{in the case of an}} endplate-type turbine.

In order to predict the true performance of the actual oscillating water column (OWC), the numerical technique was fine-tuned by incorporating the compressibility effect. Water surface elevation versus time history was used as the input data for this purpose. The effect of compressibility inside the air chamber and the turbine's performance under unsteady and irregular flow conditions were analyzed numerically. Considering the quasi-steady assumptions, the unidirectional steady-flow experimental data was used to simulate the turbines characteristics under irregular unsteady flow conditions. The results showed that the performance of this type of turbine is quite stable and that the efficiency of the air chamber and the mean conversion efficiency are reduced by around 8 % and 5 %, respectively, {{as a result of the}} compressibility inside the air chamber.

40|$|Following {{a review}} of {{previous}} research on wave power conversion, {{it is evident that}} Oscillating Water Columns {{are one of the few}} devices to successfully convert wave power to electrical power at a commercial stage. Furthermore, it is evident that the impulse turbine is a key component in this conversion process and the aim of this research is to improve its performance by designing and implementing an internally housed variable-pitch controlled <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> system. A validated 3 -D CFD technique was used to analyse the performance of varying nozzle and diffuser <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> setting angles under steady flow conditions at 0. 5 and 0. 6 hub-to-tip ratios. 0. 5 H/T recorded peak performance at 15 ⁰ nozzle and 82. 5 ⁰ diffuser angles while 0. 6 H/T recorded 15 ⁰ nozzle and 72. 5 ⁰ diffuser angles. It was observed that turbine performance was more sensitive to variation in nozzle than diffuser angle, as both torque and pressure loss were affected by the nozzle. Concurrent research by Walsh (2011) required investigation on the effect of a spherical hub and casing design on turbine performance using 3 -D CFD, designs also implemented in this research. Results showed a reduction in peak efficiency of 1. 1 percentage points at 0. 5 H/T while 0. 6 H/T was reduced by 0. 13 percentage points. Flow visualisation confirmed that this reduction in performance was caused by an area of stagnation in the hub which increased pressure loss. A 2 nd generation, internally housed variable-pitch controlled <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> system was designed and tested to validate the potential performance improvements outlined in the CFD studies. A number of concepts were evaluated before an iterative design procedure was used to develop the selected concept. The system increased efficiency from 42. 82 % with <b>fixed</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> to 56. 56 % under real sea, “Site 2 ” conditions while mechanical shaft power was increased from 97. 8 W to 200. 6 W. Steady flow testing confirmed nozzle angles of between 15 ⁰ and 17. 5 ⁰ produced optimum performance although peak efficiency of 64. 2 % was recorded at 17. 5 ⁰. Optimum diffuser angle of 72. 5 ⁰ was identified. 0. 6 H/T experimental analysis by Walsh (2011) identified optimum angles of 15 ⁰ nozzle and 78 ⁰ diffuser, validating the CFD steady flow analysis. Scaling of model test results to full scale prototype was also investigated and two methodologies were identified, the Froude and polynomial scaling methods. These were successfully used to scale bi-directional model results to varying fullscale diameters and produce turbine design charts. Little variation between methods was noted with the exception of the inclusion of turbulent scatter using the Froude method. A CFD methodology was defined and validated through experimentation to successfully simulate bi-directional flow in turbomachinery problems, modernising and improving the accuracy of CFD analysis. This method used a sliding mesh with rescaled <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> zone and produced performance trends similar to experimental for a <b>fixed</b> 30 ⁰ <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> system. At 0. 5 H/T peak efficiency of 44. 35 % was computed compared to 43. 14 % experimental, while at 0. 6 H/T 45. 52 % was computed and 45. 3 % was recorded experimentally.

40|$|In {{this project}} two pump mode tests {{has been carried}} out on a model RPT in the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU. The {{measurement}} set up and execution of the tests were the same, except for the method of dissipating energy in the system. In the first test one of the feed pumps in the basement was used as energy dissipator. In the second test a throttle valve was used as energy dissipator. The objective has been to see how the Waterpower Laboratory is suited for such a test. It was also important to test the two different dissipation methods and evaluate which should be preferred when performing a pump mode test. During the tests it was observed that the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle kept changing. When the results were processed it became evident that the variations in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle during the tests had a big influence on the measured pump curves. Variations in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle has not previously been observed during turbine mode testing. It is presumed that the variation in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angles is due to play in the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> system and the design of the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes.</b> The <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> are Francis vanes, and not RPT vanes.

40|$|In this thesis, a new {{approach}} to the selection of key fan design parameters is presented and a methodology to optimise engine operation for minimum take-off noise is developed. These techniques are applied to the detailed design of a fan system for the Cambridge-MIT Silent Aircraft Initiative engine to which ultra low noise is the principle design objective. Reduction of jet mixing noise is identified as being crucial to the design process leading to jet area at take-off having to be increased significantly compared to current trends. Whilst increasing the number of engines from two to three and optimisation of the departure profile reduced this area increase, the introduction of variable cycle technology is required in order to deliver low cruise fuel burn. A variable area nozzle, identified as the most promising technology, is linked to operation of the fan through a simple model. This is used to show {{that it is possible to}} enable large increases in exit nozzle area at take-off without compromising fan performance at cruise. For the fan design, stage loading is shown to be a critical parameter as it impacts competing requirements. Increasing loading increases efficiency and part speed capacity but makes designing <b>fixed</b> outlet <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> harder. The method to optimise the departure profile was combined with the completed fan design and extended to include fan and airframe noise sources. The results of this show that by modifying the nozzle area at all times during take-off to maximise mass flow rate, the final podded SAI design is estimated to have a noise footprint of approximately 65. 5 dBA outside the baseline airport at take-off. This leads to an ICAO take-off certification noise level of approximately 73 EPNdB at both flyover and sideline, 23 dB below existing requirements at each measuring location.

The {{results show that the}} average amplitude of the impeller passing frequency at the leading edge has a 13 % decrease under the winter condition, especially at the middle and root parts. Moreover, the dual slots structure has no effect on the overall compressor performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} a part-span {{variable}} inlet <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> to modulate the thrust of a high bypass turbofan engine was evaluated at altitude/Mach number conditions of 4572 m/ 0. 6 and 9144 m/ 0. 93. Fan-tip, gas generator and supercharger performance were also determined, both on operating lines and during fan duct throttling. The evaluation was repeated with the bypass splitter extended forward to near the fan blade trailing edge. Gross thrust attenuation of over 50 % was achieved with 50 deg variable inlet <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> closure at 100 % corrected fan speed. Gas generator supercharger performance fell off with variable inlet <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> closure but this loss was reduced when a splitter extension was added. The effect of variable inlet <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> closure on gas generator performance was minimal...|$|R
40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} study is {{conducted}} toward hybrid flow control of a full scale transport truck side mirror at ReD 3 : 2 105. A slim <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> is employed for redirecting high-momentum flow toward the mirror wake region. Leading edge separation from the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> is reduced or eliminated {{by means of an}} alternating current-dielectric barrier discharge (AC-DBD) plasma actuator. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements are performed at a range of velocities from 15 to 25 m/s and from windward to leeward angles from 5 deg to 5 deg. Time-averaged velocity fields are obtained {{at the center of the}} mirror for three scenarios: (a) reference case lacking any control elements, (b) <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> only, and (c) combination of the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> and the AC-DBD plasma actuator. The comparison of cases demonstrates that at 25 m/s windward conditions ð 5 degÞ the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> is capable of recovering 17 % momentum with respect to the reference case. No sig-nificant change is observed by activating the AC-DBD plasma actuator. In contrast, at leeward conditions ð 5 degÞ, the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> results in a 20 % momentum loss that is rec-tified to a 6 % recovery with actuation. The above implies that for a truck with two mir-rors, 23 % of momentum may be recovered. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4030724]...|$|R

Experiments in Fluids 24 (1998) 265 — 272 (Springer-Verlag 1998 Measurement and calculation of <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> performance in expanding bends for wind-tunnels B. Lindgren, J. O ® sterlund, A. V. Johansson Abstract The design of <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> for use in expanding bends was investigated both experimentally and numerically. The primary application in mind is the use of expanding corners in wind-tunnels for the purpose of constructing compact circuits with low losses. To investigate the perfor-mance of <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> in realistic situations expansion ratios between 1 and 5 3 were tested in the experiments. These were carried out in an open wind-tunnel specially built for the present purpose. The experimental results demonstrated that suitably designed <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> give very low losses and retained flow quality even for quite substantial expansion ratios. For wind-tunnel applications expansion ratios around 1. 3 seem appropriate, Optimization of a <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> design was done using a two-dimensional cascade code, Mises. A new vane optimized for an expansion ratio of 4 3 gave a two-dimensional total pressure-loss coefficient as low as 0. 041 for a chor...|$|R
40|$|The use of elbow or curved pipe in the {{installation}} of piping has a loss of pressure (pressure drop) which could lead the power of pump that drive the fluid and decrease the energy efficiency of the system. The pressure drop {{is caused by the}} curved shape of the elbow that cause pressure on the outer wall (outter) larger and blocking off the pace of the fluid, and flow pressure losses caused by friction, flow separation and secondary flow. A method {{that can be used to}} reduce flow separation and pressure loss in the elbow is by the insertion <b>guide</b> <b>vane.</b> The test model in the form of rectangular elbow 900   with a radius ratio (rc/Dh) = 1. 1249 without using a <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> and number of <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> insertion one until three <b>guide</b> <b>vanes.</b> With Reynolds number ReDh ≈ 8. 6 × 104. The velocity inlet is uniform, the measured variable is static pressure. Static pressure was measured using an inclined manometer. With variation the number of <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> gives a more effect on the value of pressure drop, the largest pressure drop until 123. 35 % compared to that without <b>guide</b> <b>vane.</b> The velocity distribution profile on the outlet side becomes more uniform. The magnitude of this pressure drop occurs as a result of the increased flow friction and its secondary flow become smaller...|$|R

30|$|The IGV servo {{actuator}} controls {{the position of}} the inlet <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> of the industrial gas turbine system. The actuator provides highly accurate position control. The actuator is a double-acting design that will close the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> on loss of electrical signals. Optimum control of the inlet <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> requires that the actuator accurately and quickly track the demand signals transmitted by the control. The IGV actuator has been designed to provide output forces that exceed the opening and closing requirements. The additional margin helps ensure that the system moves rapidly even under service conditions where the actuator has been contaminated or worn.|$|R
