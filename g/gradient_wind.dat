5000|$|A minimum {{distance}} of 500 km from the equator is normally needed for tropical cyclogenesis. The Coriolis force imparts rotation on the flow and arises as winds begin to flow {{in toward the}} lower pressure created by the pre-existing disturbance. In areas with a very small or non-existent Coriolis force (e.g. near the Equator), the only significant atmospheric forces in play are the pressure gradient force (the pressure difference that causes winds to blow from high to low pressure) and a smaller friction force; these two alone would not cause the large-scale rotation required for tropical cyclogenesis. The existence of a significant Coriolis force allows the developing vortex to achieve <b>gradient</b> <b>wind</b> balance. [...] This is a balance condition found in mature tropical cyclones that allows latent heat to concentrate near the storm core; this results in the maintenance or intensification of the vortex if other development factors are neutral.|$|E

40|$|Several {{diagnoses of}} {{three-dimensional}} circulation, using density and velocity {{data from a}} high-resolution, upper-ocean SeaSoar and acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) survey of a cyclonic jet meander and adjacent cyclonic eddy containing high Rossby number flow, are compared. The Q-vector form of the quasigeostrophic omega equation, two omega equations derived from iterated geostrophic intermediate models, an omega equation derived from the balance equations, and a vertical velocity diagnostic using a primitive equation model in conjunction with digital filtering are used to diagnose vertical and horizontal velocity fields. The results demonstrate {{the importance of the}} <b>gradient</b> <b>wind</b> balance in flow with strong curvature (high Rossby number). Horizontal velocities diagnosed from the intermediate models (the iterated geostrophic models and the balance equations), which include dynamics between those of quasigeostrophy and the primitive equations, are significantly reduced (enhanced) in comparison with the geostrophic velocities in regions of strong cyclonic (anticyclonic) curvature, consistent with <b>gradient</b> <b>wind</b> balance. The intermediate model relative vorticity fields are functionally related to the geostrophic relative vorticity field; anticyclonic vorticity is enhanced and cyclonic vorticity is reduced. The iterated geostrophic, balance equation and quasigeostrophic vertical velocity fields are similar in spatial pattern and scale, but the iterated geostrophic (and, to a lesser degree, the balance equation) vertical velocity is reduced in amplitude compared with the quasigeostrophic vertical velocity. This reduction is consistent with <b>gradient</b> <b>wind</b> balance, and is due to a reduction in the forcing of the omega equation through the geostrophic advection of ageostrophic relative vorticity. The vertical velocity diagnosed using a primitive equation model and a digital filtering technique also exhibits reduced magnitude in comparison with the quasigeostrophic field. A method to diagnose the <b>gradient</b> <b>wind</b> from a given dynamic height field has been developed. This technique is useful for the analysis of horizontal velocity in the presence of strong flow curvature.

While the basic flow is poleward and eastward off the western and southern coasts, due to strong thermohaline gradients, there is significant variability in the flow from the seasonal nature of the wind forcing and the onset of the North West Shelf waters. Model results also indicate that an equatorward (westward) undercurrent off the western (southwestern) coast of Australia is generated and maintained due to the conservation of mass continuity in response to an alongshore thermohaline gradient at deeper levels.
