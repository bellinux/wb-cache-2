25|$|While {{flying through}} a giant storm, caused by air {{escaping}} {{through a hole}} in the Ring floor due to a meteoroid impact, Teela becomes separated from the others. While Louis and Speaker search for her, their flycycles are caught by an automatic police trap designed to catch traffic offenders. They are trapped in the basement of a <b>floating</b> <b>police</b> station. Nessus enters the station to try to help them.|$|E
2500|$|The party travels back {{to their}} crashed ship in the <b>floating</b> <b>police</b> station. They {{carefully}} collect {{one end of the}} shadow-square wire that was snapped when the ship crashed, dragging the wire behind them. Louis threads the wire through the ship to tether it to the police station. He then takes the police station up to the summit of [...] "Fist-of-God", the enormous mountain near their crash site. The mountain had not appeared on the Ringworld map, leading Louis to conclude that it is in fact the result of a meteoroid impact with the underside of the ring, which pushed the [...] "mountain" [...] up from the ring's floor and broke through. The top of the mountain, above the atmosphere, is therefore just a hole in the Ringworld floor. Louis drives the police station over the edge, dragging the Lying Bastard along with it. The Ringworld spins very quickly, so once the ship drops through the hole and clears the ring, they can use the ship's hyperdrive to get home. The book concludes with Louis and Speaker discussing returning to the Ringworld.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{the order}} by the BSF the yard started {{construction}} of floating border out posts (BOPs). Essentially these BOPs are <b>floating</b> <b>police</b> stations with four high-speed boats. The yard has delivered 9 out of an order of 14 BOPs.|$|E
40|$|There {{seems to}} be no such thing as one single police culture. Depending on organization, structure, and task, culture in the police varies. In this research, counter {{terrorist}} police and criminal investigation police in Norway are compared. Although Norway has one police service, which is based on the principle of coherence, meaning that all functions are in one organization, significant cultural differences were found. The most significant difference in occupational culture was found on the scale from time firm vs. time <b>floats.</b> <b>Police</b> officers in the counter terrorist police find that time schedules, deadlines, and speed are important in their job. On the other hand, police officers in the criminal investigation police find sufficient time and not being run by the watch important in their job. The second most significant difference in occupational culture was found on the scale from legality vs. effectiveness. Police officers in the counter terrorist police find it more important to follow regulations and instructions than criminal investigators...|$|R
50|$|Candy Cane Lane {{was first}} {{decorated}} for Christmas in 1957. On December 9, 2007, the borough of Duboistown celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of Candy Cane Lane with a parade and proclamation. The parade featured thirty units, including <b>floats,</b> fire and <b>police</b> vehicles, marching bands, local politicians and celebrities, and people dressed as elves, Dugout (the Little League Baseball mascot), Frosty the Snowman, Santa and Mrs. Claus. A celebration {{followed in the}} Duboistown Fire Hall.|$|R
50|$|The Neighborhood Club of Bala Cynwyd, {{established}} in 1906, works {{to preserve the}} residential character of the neighborhood and promote civic welfare and community spirit. It sponsors an annual Independence Day celebration on July 4 which begins {{in front of the}} Union Fire Association on Montgomery Avenue and ends at the Bala Cynwyd Playground. The parade features neighborhood children riding decorated bicycles, marchers in costumes, clowns, <b>floats,</b> fire trucks, <b>police,</b> and public officials.|$|R
50|$|Given Singapore's {{standing}} as a trading port {{since its founding}} in 1819, problems of piracy had accompanied its early maritime history until the 1840s when Temmenggong Daeng Ibrahim and his son, Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor, openly supported the British efforts to fight piracy. In 1866, the police's maritime operations were formally established with the building of a <b>floating</b> <b>police</b> station. Dedicated police patrol boats began patrolling the waters around the colony.|$|E
50|$|In 1985 she was {{chartered}} to the American Star Line (Greek owned) and renamed Betsy Ross for cruises between Florida and Brazil. However, {{these were}} undersubscribed so instead she ran cruises between Venice and Piraeus until being laid-up. By this time her general condition was deteriorating and a charter for African cruises {{had to be}} abandoned after a short time.In 1989 she was chartered as Amalfi, only to be laid up for debt at Venice. She was purchased at auction in 1990 by Stargas, renamed Star of Venice, and put under the Vanuatu flag. After a fire in 1991 she was repaired in Rijeka only to become a <b>floating</b> <b>police</b> hostel in 1992 both at Genoa and at Pianosa, Italy, at that time a maximum-security prison island which housed terrorists {{and members of the}} Mafia. Once more she was laid up at Venice until being brought into operation for Mediterranean Cruises in 1998, with disastrous results stemming from her poor mechanical condition. In 2000 she was last used as a hotel ship at Ravenna.|$|E
5000|$|Based on {{his studies}} {{of an ancient}} Ringworld map, Louis devises a plan to escape. The four explorers, with Seeker and Prill, use the <b>floating</b> <b>police</b> station {{as a vehicle to}} travel back to the explorers' crashed ship. Teela and Seeker choose to remain on Ringworld. The {{remaining}} explorers and Prill collect one end of the shadow-square wire that was dislodged when the ship crashed, dragging the wire behind them as they travel. Reaching the wreck, Louis threads the wire through the ship and uses it to tether the ship to the police station. Still in the station, he then continues to pull the wire onward, up to the summit of [...] "Fist-of-God", the enormous mountain near their crash site. The massive mountain had not appeared on a map of the original Ringworld, leading Louis to conclude that it was in fact the result of a meteoroid impact with the underside of the ring, which pushed the [...] "mountain" [...] up from the ring floor and broke through. The top of the mountain, above the edge of the ring's atmosphere, is therefore a passage to the underside of the Ringworld and freedom. Louis drives the police station {{over the edge of the}} crater. The Ringworld spins very quickly, so once the police station and ship are free of the ring, their speed is enough to get them back to open space in a reasonable time. The crew can then use the ship's hyperdrive to get home. The book concludes with Louis and Speaker discussing returning to the Ringworld.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 13 January 2011 a several hundred metre long section of the Riverwalk broke away from the main {{structure}} and <b>floated</b> downstream. Queensland <b>Police</b> temporarily closed the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges (commonly known as the Gateway Bridge) several times as there were fears that sections of Riverwalk could collide with and damage the bridge. The largest part of the floating boardwalk was safely guided under the bridge by a tugboat and past other infrastructure before being safely secured. Other tugs and Water Police guided other Riverwalk sections under the bridge. The damaged Riverwalk was rebuilt as a fixed structure by the Brisbane City Council. The 18-month construction commenced in early 2013 and was completed in September 2014.|$|R
50|$|Nowadays, in more {{politically}} correct times, {{he would probably}} be abolished by the Garda Ombudsman Commission, and possibly also prosecuted...Had his unit, known as Prevention and Detection of Street Nuisances, been continued rather than disbanded on his retirement, I suspect that the streets of Dublin would be considerably safer than they are now....I am dealing primarily with my experiences in trials on indictment, which evolved from a situation in my early days where there was an attack on Garda behaviour in virtually every case, to {{a situation in which}} there is now virtually no criticism of garda conduct in my court.In what I might describe as the bad old days, there were frequent allegations of verbals being <b>floated</b> in the <b>police</b> car {{on the way to the}} station or on the stairs leading from the cells to the dock...I never hear such allegations now.|$|R
40|$|This Article reconceptualizes the {{relationship}} between floating liens and static liens in order to refine the theoretical and practical treatment of floating liens under the Bankruptcy Code. This reconceptualization in turn lends clarity to the regulation of asset securitization {{as a form of}} financing. Traditionally, floating liens, such as security interests in inventory or accounts receivable, have been controversial because they appear to involve debtors granting interests in property they do not own. This Article contends that this argument is misguided because most, if not all, liens involve the debtor granting interests not yet owned. However, the concern surrounding floating liens is justified because of the unique principles of individuation involved in fluid assets, which grants fluid assets a unique degree of dynamism and makes floating liens ideal vehicles for preferential behavior. Understanding the differences between the principles of individuation unifying what are traditionally conceived of as fluid assets and static assets not only permits an accurate understanding of the true difficulties in <b>policing</b> <b>floating</b> liens but also provides a theoretical basis for differentiating between preferential transfers between the debtor and creditor and what this Article refers to as 2 ̆ 2 recuperative transfers 2 ̆ 2 (which should be permitted) from the debtor to the creditor. This Article leverages these theoretical insights to fashion the Matrix Test, an alternative to the current Two-Point Net Improvement Test under the Bankruptcy Code. This new test holds significant advantages in accommodating the dynamism of fluid assets and detecting preferential behavior. This Article then argues that asset securitization provides a first best solution to the problems created by the unique dynamism of fluid assets because asset securitization severs a fluid asset from the originating business, the source of a fluid asset 2 ̆ 7 s dynamism. The current jurisprudential concern that asset securitization is actually a form of floating lien is misguided because it fails to recognize the fundamental economic differences between floating liens and asset securitization, and the current jurisprudential restrictions on asset securitization, expressed in the true sale requirement, are self-defeating because they ultimately restrict an ideal alternative to the difficulties of <b>policing</b> <b>floating</b> liens...|$|R
50|$|Stardust the Super Wizard {{learned that}} the “Skullface” Kurd Mob were {{planning}} to rob the entirety of New York City. The 300-thousand member gang planned to terrorize the city by crippling the subway system and bombing the streets and bridges. Then they planned to massacre the entire police force with super-tommy guns. With the cops out of the picture, they {{would be free to}} take over. Stardust set out for Earth, hoping to arrive in time to save the people of New York. Gangsters took out the subway using powerful time-bombs. Bombers swoop out of the sky and drop bombs on the streets and the bridges. Terror-stricken people rushed along streets filled with the dead and dying. The police responding to the crisis are picked off by snipers hidden in nearby buildings. A terrific battle ensued between the police and the gangsters. Tear gas was used by both sides. Just as the police gained the upper hand, Skullface ordered another bombing run. Their number decimated, out of ammunition, and exhausted, the police were forced to retreat. The gangsters drove the police to Central Park where they planned to slaughter them in a final bombing run. Stardust appeared just in time to destroy the bombers. He then scooped up the surviving officers in his tubular spacial and suspended them in the sky beyond the firing range of the gangsters. Stardust flashed down to the park to confront Skullface and his gang. Skullface ordered his men to fire. Stardust used his mental powers to stop them. Stardust then grabbed Skullface around his torso, lifted him off the ground, and ordered him to assemble his gang. The word went out and gangsters {{from all parts of the}} city gathered in Central Park. Stardust gathered the entire gang in his tubular spacial and whisked them into the air. As they passed the <b>floating</b> <b>police</b> officers, Stardust released his gravity control and set them gently back on the ground. With a tremendous burst of speed, Stardust launched the gangsters into outer space. In a short while, they arrived at a planet made purely of gold, diamonds, and emeralds. The gangsters’ excitement was short lived. The gravity of the planet was so strong, no one was able to lift anything. Stardust informed them that the air of the planet was so pure and full of vitamins that they were sure to live for a very long time. “Feast your eyes on the gold and precious stones while you can, for night will soon come—a black night that will last for centuries!” Stardust then took off, abandoning the Skullface Kurd Mob to their well-deserved fate.|$|E
5000|$|Homosexuality is not {{technically}} illegal in Egypt, but is considered taboo. Until recently, the government denied that homosexuality existed in Egypt, but recently official crackdowns have occurred for reasons felt {{to include the}} desire to appease Islamic clerics, to distract from economic issues, or as a cover-up for closet homosexuals in high places. In 2002, 52 men were rounded up on the Queen Boat, a <b>floating</b> nightclub, by <b>police,</b> where they were beaten and tortured. Eventually 29 were acquitted and 23 were convicted for [...] "debauchery and defaming Islam" [...] and sentenced {{for up to five}} years in prison with hard labor. Since the trial was held in a state security court, no appeal was allowed. A spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, a political party rising in popularity in Egypt, condemns homosexuality, saying, [...] "From my religious view, all the religious people, in Christianity, in Judaism, condemn homosexuality," [...] he says. [...] "It is against the whole sense in Egypt. The temper in Egypt is against homosexuality." [...] A government spokesman said the Queen Boat incident was not a violation of human rights but, [...] "actually an interpretation of the norms of our society, the family values of our society. And no one should judge us by their own values. And some of these values in the West are actually in decay." ...|$|R
