50|$|After the {{democratic}} changes on 5 October 2000, {{the development of}} the school went into two directions: not only did the school become the leader in introducing innovations and higher standards in secondary education but it also returned to its glorious tradition and past which this educational institution has. There are four departments at school today: science department, humanities department, department for mathematically gifted students and general-sports department. Since 2007 there have been experimental classes of the last two primary school grades (7th and 8th grade). The school is equipped with three modern IT study rooms and specialized rooms for mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology with the laboratories, school library with 30 000 books, stateroom and gym. There are extracurricular activities like choir and orchestra, French drama group, reciting group, eco club, debate club, editorial staff of the school newspaper “Skamija” (founded in 1972), linguistic workshop, psychology workshop, chemistry and biology workshop, art workshop and <b>IT</b> <b>workshop.</b> For years the cultural exchange of teachers and students has been realized with a High School from Slaný (Czech Republic), and from this year the same form of exchange will start with the High School from Moscow called “Elada”.|$|E
40|$|This volume {{collects}} {{the papers}} of the Third Interop-Vlab. <b>IT</b> <b>Workshop</b> on Enterprise Interoperability held in Naples, on the 9 th October 2010. The workshop is promoted {{and supported by the}} “Polo di ricerca scientifica e tecnologica sull’interoperabilità – Interop-Vlab. IT ” a scientific, cultural and non-profit association aimed at promoting research and initiatives on enterprise interoperability, from the technological, to the methodological, organizational, and cultural perspectives. Interoperability mainly concerns enterprises, public administration, business processes, organizations, people, and software applications. The preconditions to develop interoperability solutions are:- cross-fertilization between different research communities, mainly, enterprise modelling, ontologies, software architectures and platforms;- definition and development of methods supporting collaborations among experts coming from the above indicated communities. Interop-Vlab. IT is affiliated to Interop-Vlab. Eu, a network of research poles acting as an European virtual research laboratory in the interoperability domain.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University, 20 / 07 / 1996. From 1990 to 1993 I was engaged as the Information Technology (<b>IT)</b> <b>Workshop</b> manager at Mid-Cornwall College, St. Austell. My mission during this period {{was to develop a}} new kind of IT learning environment. The main purpose was - and continues to be - to provide for mixed 'open-access’ student targets wishing to pursue generic IT activities and gain commensurate vocational qualifications. This Open-Learning (OL) environment provides on-the-job curriculum development of IT learning support systems, through a Flexible Learning (FL) management policy. An action research approach based on S-O-L provides both the methodology and technology for implementing a learning organisation. A key objective was institutional change towards the learning management policy of IT, through appropriate deployment of staffing and courseware resources to enable the practice of student centred learning. Another aim was to integrate and mix all target groups of learners together in the same domain, i. e. school leavers with adult returners for the achievement of a cost-effective, well-co-ordinated and productive learning environment. My action research applied the Centre for the Study of Human Learning's (CSHL's) ideas and tools towards the development of the IT Workshop's learning policy. I have sought to make the connection between FL delivery of the generic IT curriculum and the SOL approach towards individual and organisational learning. This came about from the link between the FL philosophy of learner-centred activity and the SOL philosophy of empowering individuals via Learning Conversations. S-O-L'Systems- 7 ' was adopted as a conversational tool for developing the educational roles and practices of the <b>IT</b> <b>Workshop.</b> This influenced my college to make essential environmental changes to the workshop in order to develop these activities. The project also used the Personal Learning Contract (PLC) to manage and enable the 'learning-to-learn' activities of individual IT learners. With the PLC as the central tool for implementing Learning Conversations, there evolved the idea of 'Group Learning Contracts' (GLCs). This led to the practical development of 'Learning Plans' (LPs), such that IT flexible modules could be transferred to the autonomy of the learner. Evaluations from this project included sample case-study evidences of Learning Conversations obtained from individual IT case-load students. Repertory grid feedback conversations of learning experienced by individual staff members taking part in the project were also obtained. Questionnaire results from IT learners was used as another method of feedback, and conversationally evaluated using factor analysis and 'talkback' records. All the action research qualitative evidences were finally analysed using conversational techniques, leading to the overall project 'findings'...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Modularity, composability, and {{interoperability}} are buzzwords, {{which can}} be heard at every <b>IT</b> <b>workshop.</b> The number of reference models is only surpassed {{by the number of}} standards “enabling ” interoperability. Every community has its own architecture framework, its own procedures and methods, and its own standards. We are moving from proprietary stove-piped systems to standard-driven stove-piped system. M&S and Command & Control are just one example of IT worlds divided by common standards. How can this “Interoperability War, ” the fight about who’s standard is more interoperable, be ended? The paper recommends the establishment of common metamodels and mappings to various feasible and applicable solutions to avoid having to fight this war. If a standard is applicable and fulfills the user requirements, {{there is no reason to}} replace this standard with something else. Some solutions may even require proprietary, but highly efficient solutions, in particular when it comes to getting information to the soldiers at the pointed end of the spear on the battlefield. However, this does not mean that interoperability must be sacrificed. In the network domain, the 7 -layer ISO/OSI model is an example how various families of standards can be applied to support the same requirements using different implementations and still having interoperability bridges at defined points. The layered framework recommended in this paper is trying to translate this idea for system interoperability on the various layers: protocols, semantics, dynamics, pragmatics, and even concepts. To exemplify the idea, some mappings to M&S and Command & Control standards will be given. The framework is applicable to new SISO efforts, such as the XMSF Profile study group, as well. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Many UN and WHO {{documents}} {{assert the}} relationship between health and human rights. Both organizations acknowledge that addressing the right to health will require societal change {{to meet the needs}} of people who live in poverty, particularly women and girls. How can occupational therapists respond to this call to action? Learning Objectives: 1. Participants can access documents to argue the importance of: • Framing occupational rights as a human right • Gathering data on the human rights issues of local populations, communities and individuals • Designing curricula that respond to social, economic and health disparities and diversity • Educating students in activist occupational therapy • Producing graduates who enact principles of respect, tolerance and recognition (UNESCO, 2011) 2 Participants can defend: • Why occupational therapy must turn its attention to societal conditions that create ill-health and absence of occupational rights • The ethical basis of human and occupational rights • The need for new knowledge, such as capability theory (Nussbaum, 2011). Process: The starting point for this workshop is the vision created by the WFOT International Advisory Group: Human Rights - that every occupational therapy educational programme includes theory and practical education on enabling societal change to create more inclusive societies. Teaching Methods: Brief presentations with spaces for dialogue with the architects of this vision, and sharing of stories from the educators and therapists who are charged with responding to <b>it.</b> <b>Workshop</b> Outcomes: Participants and others will use documents that will be shared via the WFOT website, e. g. a bibliography, region-specific priorities, strategies and examples for societal change.

50|$|Leeds {{is notable}} for designing, {{manufacturing}} and maintaining its own Christmas Light motifs. <b>Its</b> <b>workshop</b> {{began as a}} place to provide people with disabilities some employment opportunities. <b>Its</b> <b>workshop</b> has had several locations, beginning in a temporary location near Chapeltown Road, then to the old disused Whitbread Brewery site at Kirkstall and from 1993 to the present Seacroft location. Leeds City Council was the only local authority to do this for some years but now a small number have followed Leeds Lights example in preparing their own displays where as most other councils buy in their lights and services. The lights are repaired and pressure cleaned annually at the Leeds Lights workshop in Seacroft throughout the year. 80,000 coloured lamps are stored at the workshop, and 2000m of coloured rope light are used. A team of 14 works all year round producing the display. From October-January, a team of 9 works to erect the lights ready for the switch on in early November, before removing the lights after Christmas.|$|R
