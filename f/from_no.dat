5|$|A four-man {{survey party}} <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 5 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF arrived on Goodenough Island on 3 January 1943.

A member of the survey team and 100 local workers recruited by ANGAU began constructing a jetty at Beli Beli Bay and improving the foot track to Vivigani.

5|$|No. 20 Squadron {{was formed}} at Port Moresby, New Guinea, on 1 August 1941 {{for a general}} {{reconnaissance}} role, {{under the command of}} Squadron Leader W.N. Gibson. Its establishment was six PBY Catalina flying boats and 133 personnel, but only five aircraft (all transferred <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 11 Squadron) and 55 personnel were available initially. The squadron conducted long-range patrols between bases scattered around the islands to Australia's north in conjunction with No. 11 Squadron.

5|$|No. 80 Squadron was re-equipped with newer model Hawker Hurricane Mk Is on 20 February 1941. That day, Pattle, flying Hurricane Mk I V7724, {{was leading}} {{a group of}} six Hurricanes escorting 16 Blenheim light bombers — eight <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 84 Squadron RAF, six <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 211 Squadron and three <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 30 Squadron RAF—to Berat. Fiat G.50bis from the 361a and 395a Squadriglia, 154° Autonomo Gruppo were {{scrambled}} from Berat airfield, but they were attacked by the higher altitude Hurricanes. Pattle led his section straight towards four Fiat G.50s and selected the leading aircraft as his own target. It {{was the first time}} he had fired the eight guns of the Hurricane, and the G.50 exploded. The Fiat G.50 was from 154° Gruppo and it was the first Hurricane victory that Pattle would claim. Tenente Livio Bassi was killed in this battle. Another CR.42 fell to Pattle on 27 February 1941 — his 17th victory. His Hurricane sustained a bullet hole in the fuel tank.|$|E

5|$|The British {{correctly}} {{estimated the}} German strength as 250 aircraft.

Ten of the RAF fighters in the air (nine Spitfires <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 19 Squadron and one Hurricane <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 151 Squadron) were armed with 20mm cannon.|$|E
5|$|The Malayan Emergency was {{declared}} on 18 June 1948, after three estate managers were murdered {{by members of}} the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). Australian involvement began in June 1950, when in response to a British request, six Lincolns <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 1 Squadron and a flight of Dakotas <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 38 Squadron arrived in Singapore to form part of the British Commonwealth Far East Air Force (FEAF). The Dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs, troop movement, as well as paratroop and leaflet drops, while the Lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the Communist Terrorist (CT) jungle bases. The RAAF were particularly successful, and in one such mission known as Operation Termite, five Lincoln bombers destroyed 181 communist camps, killed 13 communists and forced one into surrender, in a joint operation with the RAF and ground troops. The Lincolns were withdrawn in 1958, and were replaced by Canberra bombers <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 2 Squadron and CAC Sabres <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 78 Wing. Based at RAAF Base Butterworth they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas.|$|E

5|$|The {{stand down}} order had meant RAF Bomber Command's {{contribution}} to the proceedings came relatively late in the day. It dispatched a total of 73 bombers at between 13:55 and 14:50 (GMT). None of the attackers succeeded in hitting their targets. At 14:35 nine Bristol Beauforts <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 42 Squadron led by W.H Cliff took off. Arriving over Manston at 14:50 they found other aircraft <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 407 RCAF orbiting. It took nearly 30 minutes to form a proper formation. With several other squadrons they attacked the Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen at heights of between 60 and 100 feet but their torpedoes missed. No losses were suffered by No. 42 Squadron. The Hudsons struck at between 400 and 900 feet. Two RCAF bombers were lost without success. No. 217 Squadron nearly achieved a hit on Gneisenau, but the ship turned away, just missing the salvo. Later, another wave of 134—137 bombers intercepted the ships between 16:00 and 17:05. Only 20 crews managed to make attacks owing to poor training (Bomber Command crews were not trained to hit naval targets), a low cloud base (700 metres) and poor visibility (sea level visibility was between 1,000 and 2,000 yards). Nine bombers were lost. Another formation of 35 Vickers Wellington aircraft attempted a strike between 17:50 and 18:15, losing two of their number. The most notable raid in this action was by six Beauforts <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 86, three <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 217 and three <b>from</b> <b>No.</b> 22 Squadron. Wing Commander C. Flood, No. 86 Squadron led the attack in the only ASV-loaded aircraft. Locating the German ships in the darkness they attacked, but heavy AAA fire scattered the bombers and no successes were achieved. Of the 242 bombers that {{took part in the}} missions, it is likely only 39 conducted attacks, though it is possible that a further 16 carried out attacks, suggesting a total of 54 aircraft actually released their bombs against the ships. Of this total 15 of those were shot down. RAF Fighter Command also threw in fighter-bombers to try and inflict damage, operating Hawker Hurricanes over the Dover area.|$|E
