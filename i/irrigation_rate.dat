The study was carried out during seasons of 2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011 at the nursery of the Ornamental Horticulture Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Cairo University, Egypt. The seedlings were irrigated with potable tap water (control) and three treated wastewater types (primary, aeration and secondary) at two rates (75 and 100 % field capacity (F.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that expected warming trends from increased greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing have been locally masked by irrigation induced cooling, and it is uncertain how {{the magnitude of this}} irrigation masking effect will change in the future. Using an irrigation dataset integrated into a global general circulation model, we investigate the equilibrium magnitude of irrigation induced cooling under modern (Year 2000) and increased (A 1 B Scenario, Year 2050) GHG forcing, using modern <b>irrigation</b> <b>rates</b> in both scenarios. For the modern scenario, the cooling is largest over North America, India, the Middle East, and East Asia. Under increased GHG forcing, this cooling effect largely disappears over North America, remains relatively unchanged over India, and intensifies over parts of China and the Middle East. For North America, irrigation significantly increases precipitation under modern GHG forcing; this precipitation enhancement largely disappears under A 1 B forcing, reducing total latent heat fluxes and the overall irrigation cooling effect. Over India, <b>irrigation</b> <b>rates</b> are high enough to keep pace with increased evaporative demand from the increased GHG forcing and the magnitude of the cooling is maintained. Over China, GHG forcing reduces precipitation and shifts the region to a drier evaporative regime, leading to a relatively increased impact of additional water from irrigation on the surface energy balance. Irrigation enhances precipitation in the Middle East under increased GHG forcing, increasing total latent heat fluxes and enhancing the irrigation cooling effect.

Two pruning systems, one and two branches and four irrigation rates, 100 % (T 1, full water), 80 % (T 2), 60 % (T 3) and 40 % (T 4) of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) were compared. The highest productivity in plants pruned to two branches was related to the increase in fruit cluster than that detected in plants pruned to one branch. Whereas, the plants pruned to one branch exhibited improved fruit quality (dry matter, titratable acidity, vitamin C, total soluble solids and total sugars). The highest irrigation rates, T 1 and T 2, produced the highest fruit yield, although the increased water stress treatment (T 4) enhanced the fruit quality traits. Water-use efficiency increased with two branches pruning system and under water stress conditions. Irrigation treatment T 2 was considered more appropriate for optimizing water-use efficiency without any significant reduction in the total fruit yield.

These experiments were conducted under the variable-rate, center pivot irrigation system developed by the USDA-ARS at Florence, SC. The irrigation system covers approximately 6 -ha; it is a 137 -m long three span commercial center pivot that had been modified to provide site-specific irrigation applications. The pivot was divided into thirteen 9. 1 -m segments along its length. The pivot was designed to apply seven water rates from 0 to 12. 7 mm in seven equal steps while traveling at 50 % of its maximum speed. The <b>irrigation</b> <b>rates</b> were controlled by solenoids connected to a programmable logic controller (PLC). The PLC used angular position data from the center pivot controller and data tables to switch the solenoids on and off at appropriate locations throughout the field. Additional details regarding the pivot design {{can be found in}} Omary et al. 1997.

Data on water withdrawals for US states (1985 - 2005) show that both quantities are highly positively correlated with moisture deficit (precipitation [...] PET). If current trends hold, climate change would increase agricultural demand for irrigation in 2090 by 4. 5 - 21. 9 million ha (B 1 scenario demand: 4. 5 - 8. 7 million ha, A 2 scenario demand: 9. 1 - 21. 9 million ha). Much of this new irrigated area would occur in states that currently have a wet climate and {{a small fraction of}} their agricultural land currently irrigated, posing a challenge to policymakers in states with less experience with strict regulation of agriculture water use. Moreover, most of this expansion will occur in states where current agricultural production has relatively low market value per hectare, which may make installation of irrigation uneconomical without significant changes in crops or practices by producers. Without significant increases in irrigation efficiency, climate change would also increase the average <b>irrigation</b> <b>rate</b> from 7, 963 to 8, 400 - 10, 415 m³ ha⁻¹ (B 1 rate: 8, 400 - 9, 145 m³ ha⁻¹, A 2 rate: 9, 380 - 10, 415 m³ ha⁻¹).

The bulk density was spatially modeled by LMCR, and extended to the rooting depth by linear regression. The spatial distributions modeled were implemented in a GIS with other spatial information layers of irrigation management parameters, such as the maximum allowable depletion of soil water content, the percent of wetted soil and the irrigation depth. The combination of these layers in the GIS was used to estimate the maximum irrigation rates for each field. A propagation error analysis was performed to know the uncertainties in the maximum <b>irrigation</b> <b>rate</b> estimation. Based on this information, the irrigation managers could optimize the irrigation rates for each field.

40|$|Soil water {{budgets are}} {{essential}} {{in determining the}} proper timing and amount of irrigation. Organic fertilizers can be substituted for commercial fertilizers; however, information is sparse on the interaction of irrigation management and nutrient source on cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) production. This study evaluated nutrient source and irrigation management on growth and yield of cucumber grown in the arid area of Egypt. A field experiment was conducted using cucumber grown in northern Egypt at Shibin El-Kom in 2006 and 2007 to evaluate water use and fertilizer rate and type. Three irrigation deficits and seven fertilization types were arranged in a randomized split-plot design with <b>irrigation</b> <b>rates</b> as main plots and fertilizer treatments within <b>irrigation</b> <b>rates.</b> <b>Irrigation</b> treatments were a ratio of crop evapotranspiration (ET) as: 1. 0 ET, 0. 84 ET, and 0. 64 ET. Fertilizer treatments were applied at the recommended rate of N either as a commercial fertilizer or with organic manure. Chlorophyll a and b, leaf area index, and yield were greatest with the lowest ratios of male to female flowers when adequate water and high N were used (1. 0 ET with chicken manure at 7 Mg/ha). Seasonal water use was 498 and 471 mm for 1. 0 ET in 2006 and 2007 plantings over the 125 d growing season, respectively. The yield reduction coefficient averaged 0. 77. An optimal scheduling was statistically developed based on crop response in deficit irrigation to achieve maximum yield for different uniformity coefficient variation values. Cucumber performance was significantly affected by both irrigation and nutrient deficiencies...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of burrowing by natural populations of Trypaea australiensis on benthic metabolism, nutrient flux, denitrification and <b>irrigation</b> <b>rates</b> using in situ benthic chambers and exclusion nets to minimise disturbance and associated artefacts. The burrows of T. australiensis enhanced total sediment porewater exchange rates 5 -fold compared to uninhabited sediments. Calculated single-burrow flow rates were – 1, and active burrow irrigation appeared to be linked to tidal movement; as such, ex situ studies (i. e. mesocosm or laboratory incubations) may underestimate burrow <b>irrigation</b> <b>rates.</b> The presence of T. australiensis increased sediment oxygen demand by 81 % as compared to unoccupied sediments. Approximately 15 % of this additional consumption was used by T. australiensis for respiration, with the remaining 85 % consumed within the burrows by oxidation reactions and microbial respiration. The proportion of smaller sediment particles, porosity and organic matter content was increased in the presence of T. australiensis, and sediment surface chl a concentrations were ca. 50 % lower than uninhabited sediments. Net denitrification rates were 4 times greater in the presence of active T. australiensis burrows and at densities of 22 burrows m– 2 were responsible for approximately 76 % of total denitrification in the study site sediments. NH 4 + efflux was higher in the inhabited sediments and NO 3 – and NO 2 – effluxes were lower, suggesting that increased NH 4 + mineralisation may have enhanced denitrification via the close coupling of nitrification–denitrification in the inhabited sediments. As such, T. australiensis appears to contribute significantly to net sediment N 2 efflux in lower subtropical estuarine environments...|$|R
