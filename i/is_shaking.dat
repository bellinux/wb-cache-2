25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Williams process, invented by cinematographer Frank D. Williams, {{did not require}} a system of colored lights and {{could be used for}} wider shots. It was used in the scene where Kong <b>is</b> <b>shaking</b> the sailors off the log, as well as the scene where Kong pushes the gates open. The Williams process did not use bipacking, but rather an optical printer, the first such device that {{synchronized}} a projector with a camera, so that several strips of film could be combined into a single composted image. Through the use of the optical printer, the special effects crew could film the foreground, the stop-motion animation, the live-action footage, and the background, and combine all of those elements into one single shot. The optical printer would continue to be used for films until the late 1980s, when they were superseded by digital composting.|$|E
25|$|The east-facing {{pediment}} on {{the southern}} library shows Śiva seated on the summit of Mount Kailāsa, his mythological abode. His consort Umā sits on his lap and clings anxiously to his torso. Other beings are also present {{on the slopes of}} the mountain, arranged in a strict hierarchy of three tiers from top to bottom. In the top tier sit bearded wise men and ascetics, in the middle tier mythological figures with the heads of animals and the bodies of humans, and in the bottom tier large animals, including a number of lions. In the middle of the scene stands the ten-headed demon king Rāvaṇa. He <b>is</b> <b>shaking</b> the mountain in its very foundations as the animals flee from his presence and as the wise men and mythological beings discuss the situation or pray. According to the legend, Śiva stopped Rāvaṇa from shaking the mountain by using his toe to press down on the mountain and to trap Rāvana underneath for 1000 years.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the word}} reached Berlin of Russian general mobilization, Wilhelm agreed {{to sign the}} orders for German mobilization, and German troops began {{preparations}} to enter Luxembourg and Belgium as a preliminary towards invading France. As the historian Fritz Fischer noted, Bethmann Hollweg’s gamble in waiting for Russian mobilization had paid off, and the Social Democrats rallied to support the government. The Bavarian military attaché recorded that he learned of Russian mobilization:"I run to the War Ministry. Beaming faces everywhere. Everyone <b>is</b> <b>shaking</b> hands in the corridors: people congratulate one another for being over the hurdle." [...] Under the Schlieffen Plan, for Germany to mobilize was to mean war because {{as part of the}} plan, German troops as they were called up were to invade Belgium automatically. Unlike the war plans of the other powers, for Germany to mobilize was to go to war. Both Moltke and Falkenhayn told the government that Germany should declare war even were Russia to offer to negotiate.|$|E
