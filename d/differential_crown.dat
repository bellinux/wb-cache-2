5000|$|Worm drives {{have been}} used in a few {{automotive}} rear-axle final drives (though not the differential itself). They took advantage of the location of the gear being at either the very top or very bottom of the <b>differential</b> <b>crown</b> wheel. In the 1910s they were common on trucks; to gain the most clearance on muddy roads the worm gear was placed on top. In the 1920s the Stutz firm used them on its cars; to have a lower floor than its competitors, the gear was located on the bottom. An example from around 1960 was the Peugeot 404. The worm gear carries the differential gearing, which protects the vehicle against rollback. This ability has largely fallen from favour due to the higher-than-necessary reduction ratios.|$|E
50|$|The sport {{differential}} operates {{by using}} two superposition ("step up") gears at the differential, which are operated via multi-plate clutches {{each side of}} the <b>differential</b> <b>crown</b> wheel. When required by the software (using lateral and longitudinal yaw sensors, the ABS wheel sensors, and a steering wheel sensor), the control software (located in a control unit close to the rear differential), actuates the relevant clutch pack. This has the effect of taking the output shaft drive through the step-up gear to the attached wheel, while the other shaft continues to drive its wheel directly (i.e., the clutch pack not actuated). The higher speed output shaft produces increased torque to the wheel, producing a yaw (turning) moment. In normal operation increased torque is delivered to the wheel {{on the outside of the}} turn thereby increasing the vehicles turning moment, in other words, its willingness to turn in the direction pointed by the steering wheel.|$|E

This equation is the limiting equation that governs continuous time random walks with heavy tailed random waiting times. In this paper, we firstly propose a finite difference method to discretize the time variable and obtain a semi-discrete scheme. Then we discuss its stability and convergence. Secondly we consider a meshless method based on radial basis functions,(RBFs) to discretize the space variable. In contrast to conventional FDM and FEM, the meshless method is demonstrated to have distinct advantages: calculations can be performed independent of a mesh, it is more accurate {{and it can be}} used to solve complex problems. Finally the convergence order is verified from a numerical example which is presented to describe a fractal model of mobile/immobile transport process with different problem domains. The numerical results indicate that the present meshless approach is very effective for modeling and simulating fractional differential equations, and it has good potential in the development of a robust simulation tool for problems in engineering and science that are governed by various types of fractional <b>differential</b> equations. <b>Crown</b> copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Background: Phenotyping of genotype-by-environment {{interactions}} in the root-zone is of major importance for crop improvement as the {{spatial distribution of}} a plantâ€™s root system is crucial for a plant to access water and nutrient resources of the soil. However, so far it is unclear to what extent genetic variations in root system responses to spatially varying soil resources can be utilized for breeding applications. Among others, one limiting factor {{is the absence of}} phenotyping platforms allowing the analysis of such interactions. Results: We developed a system that is able to (a) monitor root and shoot growth synchronously, (b) investigate their dynamic responses and (c) analyse the effect of heterogeneous N distribution to parts of the root system in a split-nutrient setup with a throughput (200 individual maize plants at once) sufficient for mapping of quantitative trait loci or for screens of multiple environmental factors. In a test trial, 24 maize genotypes were grown under split nitrogen conditions and the response of shoot and root growth was investigated. An almost double elongation rate of crown and lateral roots was observed under high N for all genotypes. The intensity of genotype-specific responses varied strongly. For example, elongation of crown roots differed almost two times between the fastest and slowest growing genotype. A stronger selective root placement in the high-N compartment was related to an increased shoot development indicating that early vigour might be related to a more intense foraging behaviour. Conclusion: To our knowledge, RADIX is the only system currently existing which allows studying the <b>differential</b> response of <b>crown</b> roots to split-nutrient application to quantify foraging behaviour in genome mapping or selection experiments. In doing so, changes in root and shoot development and the connection to plant performance can be investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{inheritance}} of subcrown internode length {{in the winter}} barley cross NE 62203 x MO B 2632 was investigated as a component for increasing winter survival. Mean subcrown internode lengths of NE 62203 and MO B 2632 were 0. 2 and 4. 3 cm, respectively. F(, 2) plants segregated in a continuous distribution except for 13 % which were in the 0. 0 to 0. 5 cm class. Heritability estimates, calculated by the variance of F(, 2) plants method and parent-offspring regression of F(, 3) family means on F(, 2) plants, were 85. 3 and 86. 9 %, respectively. The high heritability of this character indicates that selection for short subcrown-internode length should be effective. ^ Results from generation means analysis showed that additive gene effects accounted for 95. 0 % of the total genetic variation. However, significant dominance, additive x additive epistasis, and additive x dominance epistasis were also detected. ^ Controlled environment tests investigating a genotype x environment interaction for field winter survival in winter barley were conducted. The variety Kearney dehardened at a faster rate, and had a greater reduction in survival at high crown-moisture contents that the three Nebraska lines tested. The <b>differential</b> effects of <b>crown</b> moisture content on cold injury in the cultivars studied could explain the genotype x environment interaction for field winter survival. ^ Production studies conducted at two Nebraska locations for 3 years demonstrated that winter barley yields obtained with no-tillage were comparable to those obtained with conventional tillage. Fourier (harmonic) analysis was performed on soil temperature data measured at two depths under no-tillage and conventional tillage and temperature prediction equations were computed. Soil temperature fluctuations were smaller and minimum temperatures were warmer with no-tillage compared to conventional tillage. This was due to a more compact soil {{and the presence of}} protective residue with no-till. Because minimum soil temperatures at the depth of crown formation with no-tillage were often significantly warmer ((GREATERTHEQ) 2. 0 C) than those with conventional tillage, the practice of no-tillage should increase winter survival. ...|$|R
