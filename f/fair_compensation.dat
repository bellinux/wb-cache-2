Critics said the brothers were greedy and unfair and compared their actions unfavorably to European inventors, who worked more openly. Supporters said the brothers were protecting their interests and were justified in expecting <b>fair</b> <b>compensation</b> for the years of work leading to their successful invention. Their 10-year friendship with Octave Chanute, already strained by tension over how much credit, if any, he might deserve for their success, collapsed after he publicly criticized their actions.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} off-season, Tomjanovich and the Rockets civil suit vs. the Lakers occurred. Houston's side argued that Los Angeles {{had failed to}} control Washington.

Kunnert testified during the trial and contradicted Washington's testimony, angrily branding him a liar. While the two were playing for San Diego, their wives became close friends, but their relationship only worsened over time; Washington believed the NBA was keeping Kunnert on his team to prevent him from suing him. Jack Ramsay, Portland's coach, however, said that he chose Kunnert over San Diego center Swen Nater when his team was asked by the league to submit a list of players they considered <b>fair</b> <b>compensation</b> for Walton.|$|E
5|$|This section covers {{compliance}} with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). This act provides for uniform and equitable treatment of persons displaced by a federal programs from their homes, businesses, or farms, including assuring just compensation and assisting in relocation. For example, if {{the construction of a}} highway under a federal program requires the expropriation of homes, the expropriation must be made by either providing <b>fair</b> <b>compensation</b> for that property or providing assistance for, or reimbursement of, relocation expenses incurred by the affected person. The Compliance Supplement suggests verifying that the property acquired is appraised by qualified independent appraisers, the appraisals are examined by a review appraiser to assure acceptability, and that after acceptance, the review appraiser certifies the recommended or approved value of the property for just compensation to the owner.|$|E

50|$|The Chinese government, while liberalizing its {{property}} laws, {{has still}} preserved {{its right to}} reclaim any property from an individual, {{as long as there}} is a public policy consideration. In 2004, it amended its 1982 Constitution to include that the Government has to pay the person compensation for expropriation (征收) or requisition (征用). However, the article neither provides, either in the constitution or in any subsidiary legislation, for the quantum of the payment, nor does it stipulate that the payment must be proportional to the size of the land. This has led to abuse by government bodies, especially in rural areas. Expropriation of land from farmers is the most frequent cause of complaint among farmers.However, in 2011, the Chinese Government released regulations clarifying this, which promise to provide more transparency and a <b>fairer</b> <b>compensation</b> system.|$|R

Miller's allies, including NDP leader Jack Layton, argued that the payout was overly generous, and did not reflect the true costs of cancellation.

25|$|A close {{examination}} of Medieval trade in Europe shows that numerous significant credit based trades were not bearing interest. Hence, pragmatism and common sense called for a <b>fair</b> <b>compensation</b> for the risk of lending money, and a compensation for the opportunity cost of lending money without using it for other fruitful purposes. In order to circumvent the usury laws edicted by the Church, other forms of reward were created, in particular through the widespread form of partnership called commenda, very popular with Italian merchant bankers. Florentine merchant banks were almost sure to make a positive return on their loans, but this would be before taking into account solvency risks.|$|E

The whites disarmed and proceeded to whip the Indians, when two more arrived and opened fire on the whites. Three whites were wounded and one Indian was killed and one wounded, at {{what became known as the}} skirmish at Hickory Sink. After complaining to Indian Agent Thompson and not receiving a satisfactory response, the Seminoles became further convinced that they would not receive <b>fair</b> <b>compensations</b> for their complaints of hostile treatment by the settlers.

50|$|Angered by the {{asbestos}} industry's {{response to the}} rising scrutiny of the magic mineral’s safety record, Nancy Tait established an asbestos action group in 1978, the Society for the Prevention of Asbestosis and Industrial Diseases (SPAID), {{the first of a}} string of asbestos action groups and asbestos victims support groups worldwide. SPAID lobbied for tighter asbestos controls, for <b>fairer</b> <b>compensation,</b> for better death reporting and asbestos death statistics, and supported those affected by asbestos in their endeavours to claim industrial injuries benefits and/or compensation from past employers. From 1988, SPAID ran its own electron microscope laboratory, with whose aid Tait advised special medical boards on respiratory diseases and coroners on the assessment of the presence of asbestos fibres in lung tissue. The instrument was, she stated in 1999, the only bulwark against medical experts’ efforts to secure verdicts of natural causes or open verdicts. From 1996 SPAID operated under the name Occupational and Environmental Diseases Association (OEDA).|$|R

25|$|Los Angeles-based Mike Davis, in his seminal {{work on the}} city, City of Quartz, {{describes}} the process of gradually convincing Chavez Ravine homeowners to sell. With {{nearly all of the}} original Spanish-speaking homeowners initially unwilling to sell, developers resorted to offering immediate cash payments, distributed through their Spanish-speaking agents. Once the first sales had been completed, remaining homeowners were offered increasingly lesser amounts of money, to create a community panic of not receiving <b>fair</b> <b>compensation,</b> or of being left {{as one of the few}} holdouts. Many residents continued to hold out despite the pressure being placed upon them by developers, resulting in the Battle of Chavez Ravine, an unsuccessful ten-year struggle by the residents to maintain control of their property.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} the {{government}} announcement, the patients of the Mutual Aid Society decided {{to ask for a}} new compensation agreement with Chisso and submitted the demand on 6 October. The company replied that it was unable to judge what would be <b>fair</b> <b>compensation</b> and asked the national government to set up a binding arbitration committee to decide. This proposal split the members of the patients' society, many of whom were extremely wary of entrusting their fate to a third party, as they had done in 1959 with unfortunate results. At a meeting on 5 April 1969, the opposing views within the society could not be reconciled and the organisation split into the arbitration group (who were willing to accept binding arbitration) and the litigation group (who decided to sue the company). That summer, Chisso sent gifts to the families who opted for arbitration rather than litigation.|$|E
25|$|No {{treaties}} {{were ever}} made in BC, and although Governor Douglas planned to create them, {{the gold rush}} and subsequent immigration rush hindered this. The main goal of his plan was the assimilation of the Stó:lō into European culture. He hoped to have Stó:lō pre-empt crown land for agricultural development and have them lease out parts of the reserves to non-Aboriginal farmers to aid in assimilation. While waiting {{to be able to}} negotiate treaties, which were a very expensive process, he attempted to create large Indian reserves of at least 40 hectares per family. Douglas also promised the Stó:lō <b>fair</b> <b>compensation</b> for all the land outside of the reserves being occupied by settlers. While setting up the reserves the Stó:lō were asked to help mark the territories themselves as it was recognized that only they would know what lands needed to be included such as berry patches, transformer sites, and burial grounds (although many spiritual sites were revealed to ensure their secrecy). Sergeant William McColl was directed in 1864 by Douglas to create the reserves. The surveyors outlined 15,760 hectors through present day Abbotsford, Chilliwack, and Mission. This may seem like a large amount of land, but was small in comparison to the land available to settlers.|$|E
40|$|Developing {{countries}} {{are expected to}} contribute to climate change mitigation efforts by reducing deforestation, with fi nancial compensations for associated economic losses. These losses are due to foregone revenues and limited economic development, all of these labeled “opportunity costs”. Their accurate estimation is strategic {{for at least two}} reasons: to determine <b>fair</b> <b>compensations,</b> and to prioritize low cost strategies to reduce emissions. However, numerous interpretations of the opportunity cost concept coexist in the literature and in infl uential reports (e. g. Stern review), with differing estimated values for similar cases. This paper presents a framework to better identify relevant values to the calculations: profi ts / total national economic value, conservation site / downstream industries. When applied to the pulp sector in Indonesia, the framework yields contrasted opportunity costs. This contrast is due to several factors, including the heterogeneity of the pulp industry, or the availability of non-forested lands to displace activities. These values range from zero to one thousand dollars per hectare per year. To use such a framework would help gain credibility and achieve fairness in negotiations between host countries and other stakeholders, in particular those who fund activities to reduce deforestation...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} two classical {{sources from}} Ancient India as possible sources for tackling {{the lack of}} ethics in governance and business in emerging markets today. First, Arthashastra is a treatise on economics and politics written by Kautilya, the advisor to the Mauryan emperor Chandragupta during the fourth century BC. Kautilya provided practical recommendations like providing high and <b>fair</b> <b>compensations</b> to civil servants. It is suggested that the existing wage structure creates feeling of inequity in government employees {{and is likely to}} lead to inefficiency and corruption. Second, Thirukkural is a classic of rhyming Tamil couplets, possibly written around the year 31 BC, by Thiruvalluvar, a common weaver born in Mylapore, near present-day Chennai. It {{is one of the most}} revered ancient works in the Tamil language, providing a guide for human morals and betterment in life. Like Adam Smith and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thiruvalluvar stated that ethical values coincide with a good economy and that therefore a free market is necessary. Basically humans are naturally good and contribute positively to the economy. In conclusion, while Kautilya gave pragmatic advice to tackle human’s destructive economic instincts, Thiruvalluvar assumed the natural goodness of men and warned against institutional interference.

500|$|Guitar Hero {{and other}} rock music-based games work with record {{companies}} to license each song for its use, costing a per-song average of $25,000 {{for the rights}} to use a master recording and $10,000 {{for the rights to}} make a cover. [...] The impact of Guitar Hero and Rock Band has caused record companies to create dedicated video game liaisons to handle the inclusions of songs in these games. The record and game companies work together to tie in releases of downloadable content with album releases and concert appearances, such as by the simultaneous release of Metallica's Death Magnetic album and as playable Guitar Hero tracks. [...] However, some in the music industry have raised concerns that the music labels are not receiving <b>fair</b> <b>compensation</b> considering the success of the games. [...] Edgar Bronfman Jr., chairman and chief executive for Warner Music Group, stated that [...] "The amount being paid to the industry, even though their games are entirely dependent on the content that we own and control, is far too small." [...] Tim Riley, vice president of music affairs at Activision, believes that the increase in popularity of the game series has led more people, including musicians and music labels, to {{want to be part of}} the success: [...] "The number of people interested in being associated with the game is probably a thousand times more than we can get into the game." [...] Activision CEO Robert Kotick has stated, in response to the record company's claims, that the impact that the Guitar Hero games have caused game developers and publishers to question if they [...] "should be paying any money at all and whether it should be the reverse." [...] Mötley Crüe manager Allen Kovac noted that artists make a larger share of the sale of each downloaded game song compared to iTunes, and that bands that own their own master recordings earn even a larger percentage from music licensing rights. [...] Michael Pachter, an industry analyst for Wedbush Morgan, noted that Guitar Hero is not dependent on a single record label, as there is nearly a 2000-year supply of songs available at the current rate of content releases, and a full music industry denial to the game series could lead to anti-trust measures. [...] Patcher also contrasted Bronfman's view, stating that users are not buying the games for the songs, but for the game, with each song providing its own challenge. [...] However, analysis believe that Activision's attitude on music licensing may have influenced the decision of Apple Corps, Ltd. to give the lucrative licensing agreement for The Beatles' music to MTV Games, who were more flexible in their negotiations.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{characteristics}} and functioning of PES is analyzed from an institutional perspective. While in theory PES {{is seen as}} a market solution to environmental problems [...] as an alternative to state (hierarchical) and community governance [...] a review of a large amount of case studies shows that PES in practice depends rather fundamentally on state and/or community engagement. Hence PES are foremost a reconfiguration of the roles of public bodies and communities becoming core intermediaries or 'buyers'. First, to establish PES, rights to the land that delivers the environmental service must be clarified. This demands public action. Second, transacting over environmental amenities is very costly. Creating 'markets' for environmental services depends therefore crucially on state and community facilitation. Hence 'buyers' are often public agencies. High transaction costs also influence price setting. Payments do not follow the market format as intermediaries frequently are setting the price, with users often being unaware even {{of the fact that they}} pay. Finally, the distinction between payments as incentives and as <b>fair</b> <b>compensations</b> is emphasized. While payments may strengthen community relations and simplify action for environmental care, they may also introduce a purely instrumental logic and in some cases worsen the environmental status by crowding out environmental virtues. For the future, greater awareness of these dynamics is warranted. PES Environmental governance Rights Transaction costs Motivation structures Markets Community...|$|R
