Study 1 tested the effects of mortality salience in advertisements (mortality reminder: <b>yes</b> vs. <b>no)</b> for art library and newspaper subscriptions. Study 2 used a 2 (mortality reminder: <b>yes</b> vs. <b>no)</b> × <b>2</b> (brand familiarity: low vs. high) between subjects design for newspaper subscriptions. Study 3 used a 2 (mortality reminder: <b>yes</b> vs. <b>no)</b> × <b>2</b> (product type: healthy vs. unhealthy) between subjects design for a beverage with importance of the product for consumers' self-esteem as a continuous moderator. Main dependent measures were mood; death-related thoughts; attitudes toward the ad; and purchase intentions. Across studies advertisements with a death reminder increased unconscious thoughts about death (Experiments 1 - 3), which, in turn, increased purchase intentions (Experiments 2 and 3). These effects occurred independent of mood, brand familiarity, product type, product relevance to self-esteem, and ad liking.

40|$|Objective: The {{current study}} tested whether self-affirmation {{in the context}} of a {{threatening}} health message helps promote a health behavior (fruit and vegetable consumption) over a 3 -month period, and whether adding a manipulation to support the translation of intentions into behavior (an implementation intentions induction) enhances the impact of self-affirmation. Methods: Participants (N 332, 71 % women) reported their baseline consumption and were randomly assigned to condition in a <b>2</b> (self-affirmation: <b>yes,</b> <b>no)</b> <b>2</b> (implementation intentions: formed, not formed) between-subjects factorial design. They completed a self-affirmation/control task and then read a health communication advising eating at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables daily. Next participants reported intentions for behavior change, after which they formed/did not form relevant implementation intentions. Consumption was measured again 7 days and 3 months postintervention. Results: Self-affirmed (vs. nonaffirmed) partic-ipants reported eating more fruit and vegetables at both follow-ups. Forming (vs. not forming) imple-mentation intentions was also beneficial for consumption. At 7 days, there was also a significant self-affirmation implementation intentions interaction: consumption was highest when self-affirmed participants also formed implementation intentions. Conclusions: The present study offers new evidence concerning the impact and durability of self-affirmation on health behaviors and the role of implemen-tation intentions in enhancing the impact of self-affirmation...|$|R

40|$|The study {{examined}} {{the conditions under which}} lay people and health professionals living in Chile find it acceptable for a physician to break confidentiality to protect the wife of a patient with a sexually transmitted disease (STD). One hundred sixty-nine lay persons, 10 physicians, 17 psychologists, and 11 paramedical professionals indicated the acceptability of breaking confidentiality in 48 scenarios. The scenarios were all possible combinations of five factors: disease severity (severe, lethal); time taken to discuss this with the patient (little time, much time); patient’s intent to inform his spouse about the disease (none, one of these days, immediately); patient’s intent to adopt protective behaviors (no intent, intent); and physician’s decision to consult an STD expert (<b>yes,</b> <b>no),</b> <b>2</b> x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2. The study also compared Chilean and French views, using data gathered previously in France. A cluster analysis conducted on the overall set of raw data revealed groups of participants that found breaking confidentiality “always acceptable” (9 %), requiring “consultation with an expert” (5 %), “depending on the many circumstances” (70 %), and “never acceptable” (11 %) ”. Despite clear differences in legislation and official codes of ethics between their two countries, Chilean and French lay people did not differ much in their personal convictions regarding the circumstances in which patient confidentiality can be broken or must not be broken. By contrast, Chilean physicians, in agreement with their code of ethics, were much less supportive than French physicians of complete respect of patient confidentiality in all case...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of context related information and observers' attributional style on evaluations of pain severity, the pain sufferer, and treatment choice for shoulder pain patients. Ninety-six undergraduate participants read information containing the independent variable manipulations before viewing a videotape of one of two shoulder pain patients undergoing a physiotherapy assessment. Participants then rated their perceptions of the pain patient and completed a questionnaire assessing their attributional style (AS) for others' misfortunes. This study used both a <b>2</b> (coping: <b>yes</b> or <b>no)</b> X <b>2</b> (medical evidence: present or absent) X 2 (target patients) X 3 (pain level: high, moderate, and low) design with repeated measures on the last variable (with AS as a covariate) and a <b>2</b> (coping: <b>yes</b> or <b>no)</b> X <b>2</b> (medical evidence: present or absent) X 2 (target patients) mixed design (also with AS serving as a covariate). Significant main effects and an interaction emerged indicating that a contextual factor, the perception of the patient's coping, influenced judge's perceptions of the pain sufferer. In addition, observers were sensitive judges of levels of pain severity. However, contrary to expectation, there were no effects for AS or medical evidence. Thus, while judges can differentiate between differences in the amount of pain a patient is in, pain patients appear to be facing biasing factors which may result in differential evaluations and treatment choices.

METHODS: Population-based cross-sectional study with 1, 185 female and male children and adolescents {{carried out in the}} city of Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, from 2008 to 2009. Data were collected through home interviews. Respondents were selected from two-stage (census tract, household) cluster random sampling stratified by gender and age. Multiple Poisson regression was used in the adjusted analysis between the outcome and socioeconomic, demographic, lifestyle and health condition variables. RESULTS: Of all respondents, 9. 1 % (95 %CI 7. 0; 11. 7) reported asthma. After adjustment, the following variables were found independently associated with asthma: age (0 to 4 years vs. 15 to 19) (PR 3. 18, 95 %CI 1. 20; 8. 42); age (5 to 9 years vs. 15 to 19) (PR 6. 37, 95 %CI 2. 64; 15. 39); age (10 to 14 years vs. 15 to 19) (PR 4. 51, 95 %CI 1. 95; 10. 40); allergy (<b>yes</b> vs. <b>no)</b> (PR <b>2.</b> 22, 95 %CI 1. 24; 4. 00); rhinitis (<b>yes</b> vs. <b>no)</b> (PR <b>2.</b> 13, 95 %CI 1. 22; 3. 73); health conditions in the 15 days preceding the interview (<b>yes</b> vs. <b>no)</b> (PR 1. 96, 95 %CI 1. 23; 3. 11); number of rooms in the household (1 to 3 vs. 4 and more) (PR 1. 67, 95 %CI 1. 05; 2. 66); and skin color (black and mixed vs. white) (PR 2. 00, 95 %CI 1. 14; 3. 49).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether emotions induced in TV-viewers (either as an emotional state or co-occurring with emotional involvement) would increase viewers' perception of realism in a fake documentary and affect the information value that viewers would attribute to its content.

The relationship between leaves of absence and study characteristics was assessed with univariate linear regression models. Since the values for days off work were skewed, they had to be log-transformed to use them in the regression models. As a consequence, regression coefficients and 95  % confidence intervals were converted into a percent increase in the respective variable using the formula [exp(β)− 1] ×  100. P values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using Stata version 12 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).|$|R

Traditionally, states retain the power to make most gaming-related decisions, sometimes only allowing simple 2 ̆ <b>2</b> <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2 voter referenda. This note argues that an increased role for local actors in bringing gaming to cities will best protect the interests of the people most affected by casinos. Part I provides a brief background of gambling in America and the key aspects of gaming-enabling legislation in various states. Part II discusses local government law and theory. Part III examines aspects of casino gambling that highlight the importance of local involvement in the legislative and regulatory process. It also discusses case studies of commercial casino development in Philadelphia and Detroit. Part IV compares the introduction of gaming in the two cities to better understand the successful introduction of casinos in Detroit. The Note concludes that the capability for local actors to help guide the healthy development of gambling necessarily requires that state enabling legislation reserves a role for local governments and voters in the process of introducing and licensing gaming operations in their municipality...|$|R

Contrary to our expectations, the findings show that femininity reduces inspirational motivation dimension of transformational leadership. Further, the findings of our study show that transformational leadership enhances continuance commitment only when the leader is androgynous and that transformational leadership enhances affective commitment only for the masculine leader.

We conducted a 2 (sleep deprivation: <b>yes</b> vs. <b>no)</b> × <b>2</b> (competency of advisor: medium vs. high) experimental study {{to examine the effects}} of sleep deprivation on advice taking in an estimation task. We compared participants with one night of total sleep deprivation to participants with a night of regular sleep. Competency of advisor was manipulated within subjects. We found that sleep deprived participants show increased advice taking. An interaction of condition and competency of advisor and further post-hoc analyses revealed that this effect was more pronounced for the medium competency advisor compared to the high competency advisor. Furthermore, sleep deprived participants benefited more from an advisor of high competency in terms of stronger improvement in judgmental accuracy than well-rested participants...|$|R
