500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>about</b> Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>about</b> Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker {{enjoyed the}} episode, writing that [...] "this week's Fringe {{contained}} everything <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>about</b> the show, from LSD {{to the great}} villain Thomas Jerome Newton.

Alex Zalben of UGO Networks, however, called the episode the [...] "first clunker of the season" [...] because despite approving of the plot and the acting, the [...] "writing was uniformly obvious, stilted and kind of terrible... there were more head-slappingly stupid moments than I could count".

500|$|In the {{original}} script, Frink appeared more evil. However, when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed {{a voice for}} Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's character Julius Kelp from the 1963 film The Nutty Professor, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of that character. Julius Kelp is a nerdy, mad professor, albeit not evil, and is often unsuccessful with his experiments, so Frink became more like that as the show progressed. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told TV Guide that [...] "He was just written as a mad scientist character until Hank did the voice, and suddenly he became this nutty professor persona. What <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>about</b> Hank is that, you give him a single lineand most of these characters have very few linesand he just brings it to life. Every time." [...] Frink was originally animated without his buckteeth; they were added later on {{to make him look}} even more like Lewis's character. He was named after television writer John Frink, who was later hired on The Simpsons. The nonsensical utterances that Frink makes are written in the scripts as [...] "Frink noise".|$|E
500|$|Marino {{was cast}} in November 2015, on which Fazekas said, [...] "He’s {{obviously}} very funny, but he also is a great dramatic actor.

[...] About the character, Fazekas added, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>about</b> Manfredi is he’s funny, he can flip on a dime and be a total psycho, and he is madly in love with Whitney and genuinely so—even when she’s cuckoo. Their scenes together, there’s such a tenderness to them". Since the character differs from its comic counterpart, Marino said [...] "the two things [...] " [...] were defining that Manfredi [...] "definitely was the muscle for Whitney, and that he did have a true love for her." [...] Marino wanted to make sure Manfredi [...] "felt like he was an old-school tough guy" [...] and felt that Frost was [...] "the one true love for him", comparing their relationship to Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe's.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode with a B-, explaining that [...] "after four solid weeks of good-to-great episodes, Fringe delivered its first semi-dud of season three" [...] because the case-of-the-week was [...] "dull" [...] and [...] "twistless", and the dialogue was [...] "too flat and too earnest". Despite this, Murray thought the episode was [...] "essential viewing" [...] for Fringe fans due to certain revelations, {{such as how}} people are actually alive in the amber, and also because it moved the plot closer to an Olivia-Altlivia confrontation. Conversely, the Los Angeles Times Andrew Hanson {{thought it was a}} good episode, writing [...] "This is what <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>about</b> Fringe. Not only do they have the cool science, they also have the moral questions that go along". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly thought the episode was [...] "enthralling," [...] and he enjoyed the brothers' [...] "nice emotional story," [...] and praised Anna Torv's acting. TV Squad reviewer Jason Hughes enjoyed the parallel universe, and in particular the character of Lincoln Lee, believing he was [...] "too rich a character to just abandon" [...] once the series stopped alternating between universes.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé {{explained}} on her iTunes Radio {{channel that}} [...] "Rocket" [...] {{was one of}} the [...] "most sensual songs", adding that it reminded her of the vibes of D'Angelo's song [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] (2000). The singer elaborated the concept behind the song during an album documentary filmed for Beyoncé, titled [...] "Honesty", saying, [...] "Now I'm in my 30s, and those children that grew up listening to me have grown up, and I always felt like it was my responsibility to be aware of kids and their parents and all these generation". With that said, the singer felt [...] "stifled" [...] and unable to express every feeling she wanted to show. However, she noted that with [...] "Rocket", one of the most liberating songs on the record, she managed to express many of those feelings and show different sides of her personality. Revealing that she would not have been confident enough to record the song earlier in her career, Beyoncé noted, [...] "I kinda dropped that fourth wall and I did it". The singer also discussed the meaning of the song by saying, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>about</b> this song is, it takes you through this journey. You're flirting and you're talking all of your arrogant [...] Then you climax, and then you have your cigarette... This song actually is about singing from the heart, and harmonies and adlibs and arrangement". During the same video, she praised Timberlake and Miguel's work; the clip also showed footage of Beyoncé recording the song in the studio.|$|E

[...] Kristin dos Santos of E! praised the chemistry between Naveen Andrews and Andrea Gabriel, who play Sayid and Nadia, respectively. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave Part 1 of the three-hour finale a 7.9. [...] He commended the music and called it [...] "a good opening to what should be an exciting season finale"; however, the lack of suspense in favor of set-up was cited as the reason for the modest rating. However, Carabott gave Parts 2 & 3 a perfect 10 review, tying with other perfect-10 episodes such as [...] "The Constant" [...] and [...] "Through the Looking Glass". He stated that [...] "Not a moment is wasted in this brilliantly paced and well-executed conclusion to what has been a fantastic season."

[...] Compora decided that [...] "certain characters work much better in very small doses … a little bit of [...] goes a long way [...] it was nice to see Jack featured without completely dominating an episode." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV summed up Part 1 as [...] "very good", but said that the opening flashforward in which the Oceanic Six are reunited with their families was anticlimactic and [...] "although each flashforward scene had minor and major revelations, it felt patched together and a little sloppy, like Lindelof and Cuse had all this ground to cover in their quest to link all the action up to the final scene of season 3 … That said, the flashforward scenes all played out exceedingly well." [...] Daniel of TMZ welcomed the return of Richard (on the island) and gave the episode an [...] "A", saying that it had [...] "more than a few fantastic scenes.
