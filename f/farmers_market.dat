This study {{explored}} {{the ways in}} which wireless EBT card terminals at <b>farmers???</b> <b>markets</b> affect CalFresh participants??? eating and food-purchasing behaviors. Researchers utilized a convenience sampling technique of fifty-eight CalFresh participants who shopped at Sacramento-area <b>farmers???</b> <b>markets</b> between November 2012 and February 2013. This study incorporated a survey with twenty-six questions regarding participants??? eating and food-buying behaviors. Demographic data, such as gender, ethnicity, age, and neighborhood of residence was also collected. The researchers hypothesize the intervention of EBT terminals at <b>farmers???</b> <b>markets</b> will be associated with participants??? frequency shopping at <b>farmers???</b> <b>markets</b> and consumption of healthy foods. A paired samples t-test determined there was a statistically significant difference of - 5. 60 (sd= 11. 67, t=- 3. 65, df= 57, p>. 001) between the means of participants??? frequency shopping at <b>farmers???</b> <b>markets</b> before using EBT at <b>farmers???</b> <b>markets</b> (n= 58, M= 19. 45, sd= 17. 46) and participants??? frequency shopping at <b>farmers</b> <b>markets</b> after beginning to using EBT at <b>farmers???</b> <b>markets</b> (n= 58, M= 25. 03, sd= 18. 21). Another t-test determined there was a statistically significant difference of - 1. 08 (sd= 2. 30, t=- 3. 58, df= 57, p>. 001) between the means of the number of healthy meals participants??? prepared at home before using EBT at <b>farmers???</b> <b>markets</b> (n= 58, M= 9. 17, sd= 6. 70) and the number of healthy meals participants??? prepared at home after beginning to using EBT at <b>farmers???</b> <b>markets</b> (n= 58, M= 10. 25, sd= 6. 37).
