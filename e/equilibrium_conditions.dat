5|$|The {{combined}} {{concentrations of}} gases {{in any given}} tissue depend {{on the history of}} pressure and gas composition. Under <b>equilibrium</b> <b>conditions,</b> the total concentration of dissolved gases is less than the ambient pressure—as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues, and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble. However, during a reduction in ambient pressure, the rate of pressure reduction may exceed the rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion. If the concentration gets too high, it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the supersaturated tissues. When the pressure of gases in a bubble exceed the combined external pressures of ambient pressure and the surface tension of the bubble-liquid interface, the bubbles grow, and this growth can damage tissue.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} this energy {{distribution}} manifest in the kinetic isotope effect and the equilibrium isotope effect. In a reversible reaction, under <b>equilibrium</b> <b>conditions,</b> the reaction will proceed forwards and backwards, distributing the isotopes to minimize thermodynamic free energy. Some time later, at equilibrium, more heavy isotopes {{will be on the}} product side. The stability of the lower energy drives the products to be enriched in deuterium relative to reactants. Conversely, under kinetic conditions, reactions are generally irreversible. The limiting step in the reaction is overcoming the activation energy barrier to reach an intermediate state. The lighter isotope has a higher energy state in the quantum well and will thus be preferentially formed into products. Thus under kinetic conditions the product will be relatively depleted in deuterium.|$|E

500|$|Walras' law was {{introduced}} as a theoretical {{answer to the}} problem of determining the solutions in general equilibrium. [...] His notation is different from modern notation but can be constructed using more modern summation notation. [...] Walras assumed that in equilibrium, all money would be spent on all goods: every good would be sold at the market price for that good and every buyer would expend their last dollar on a basket of goods. [...] Starting from this assumption, Walras could then show that if there were n markets and n-1 markets cleared (reached <b>equilibrium</b> <b>conditions)</b> that the nth market would clear as well. [...] This is easiest to visualize with two markets (considered in most texts as a market for goods and a market for money). [...] If one of two markets has reached an equilibrium state, no additional goods (or conversely, money) can enter or exit the second market, so it must be in a state of equilibrium as well. [...] Walras used this statement to move toward a proof of existence of solutions to general equilibrium but it is commonly used today to illustrate market clearing in money markets at the undergraduate level.|$|E

We derive a weak formulation of the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition</b> for the resulting one-phase problem that allows jumps of the temperature accross [sic] the interface. The weak formulation consists of a regularity condition that only enforces the usual <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition</b> to hold from the liquid phase. At the end we briefly discuss the radial problem in higher space dimensions. The main tool {{in order to prove}} the convergence are uniform bounds on the total variation of the free boundary that are derived using a regularized problem, where the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition</b> is substituted by a dynamical condition. 2 ̆...|$|R

2500|$|Solubility {{values of}} organic acids, bases, and ampholytes of {{pharmaceutical}} interest {{may be obtained}} by a process called [...] "Chasing equilibrium solubility". In this procedure, a quantity of substance is first dissolved at a pH where it exists predominantly in its ionized form and then a precipitate of the neutral (un-ionized) species is formed by changing the pH. Subsequently, {{the rate of change}} of pH due to precipitation or dissolution is monitored and strong acid and base titrant are added to adjust the pH to discover the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>conditions</b> when the two rates are equal. The advantage of this method is that it is relatively fast as the quantity of precipitate formed is quite small. However, the performance of the method may be affected by the formation supersaturated solutions.|$|E
2500|$|Open mode systems, are {{designed}} to find soil flux rates when measuring chamber equilibrium has been reached. Air flows through the chamber before the chamber is closed and sealed. This purges any non-ambient CO2 levels from the chamber before measurement. After the chamber is closed, fresh air is pumped into the chamber at a controlled and programmable flow rate. This mixes with the CO2 from the soil, and after a time, equilibrium is reached. The researcher specifies the equilibrium point as the difference in CO2 measurements between successive readings, in an elapsed time. During the assay, {{the rate of change}} slowly reduces until it meets the customer's rate of change criteria, or the maximum selected time for the assay. [...] Soil flux or rate of change is then determined once <b>equilibrium</b> <b>conditions</b> are reached within the chamber. Chamber flow rates and times are programmable, accurately measured, and used in calculations. These systems have vents that {{are designed}} to prevent a possible unacceptable buildup of partial CO2 pressure discussed under closed mode systems. Since the air movement inside the chamber might cause increased chamber pressure, or external winds may produce reduced chamber pressure, a vent is provided that is designed to be as wind proof as possible.|$|E
2500|$|The best current {{example is}} {{illustrated}} by the United States Geological Survey study of Columbia Glacier. [...] They noted that the average calving rate from Columbia Glacier increased from 3km3⋅a−1 {{in the second half of}} 1983 to 4km3⋅a−1 during the first nine months of 1984. This rate was four times greater than that measured at the end of 1977 and increased again in 1985. The glacier flow, i.e., the movement of the ice toward the sea, also increased, it was inadequate to keep pace with the break-up and expulsion of icebergs. [...] The increase in speed instead seemed to just feed the ever faster conveyor to the terminus for iceberg production. This prompted the USGS to predict that the glacier would retreat 32km before stabilizing. [...] By 2006, it has retreated 16km. The water remains deep and the calving rate and glacier velocity very high, indicating retreat will continue. At this point, just like having a balloon payment in an adjustable rate mortgage, the glacier has to pay a whole new portion of its balance via icebergs. [...] The glacier accelerates as flow is enhanced by the calving process; this increases the export of icebergs from the glacier. [...] Large calving retreats are initiated by warming conditions causing ice thinning. [...] The resulting retreat to a new <b>equilibrium</b> <b>conditions</b> can be far more extensive than will be regained during the next advance stage. A good example of this is Muir Glacier.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFuel {{management}} of once-through-then-out (OTTO) cycle Pebble Bed Reactors (PBR) was studied, {{in particular the}} start-up condition of the core before it achieves the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition.</b> Optimum and simple fuel management performance in the start-up condition {{is important for the}} practical deployment of PBR. There is no option for fuel re-insertion in an OTTO cycle PBR, hence nuclear fuel utilization is an important factor not only in the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition</b> but also in the start-up condition. The {{purpose of the study was}} to find an optimum procedure to improve burnup performance of fuel management in startup of the OTTO cycle PBR. Initial Heavy Metal (HM) loading in the core, power density, and multiplication factors were the main parameters investigated. The target of the analysis was a small sized 10 MW PBR. A newly developed code system for OTTO cycle PBR was used. The code system is capable of performing neutron transport and depletion calculations of the OTTO cycle PBR covering whole of its fuel management scheme from initial loading to <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition.</b> In this study, fuel composition in the start-up condition was limited to the same composition (a single enrichment) as the fuel in <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition</b> for simplicity of the whole fuel management. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition</b> of the PBR was investigated first. Based on the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition</b> two start-up fuel management schemes, a mixed and top-bottom scheme, were investigated. It was found that mixed scheme is better compare to top bottom scheme in achieving efficient HM-loading. Mixed scheme also gave a lower maximum power density. For the chosen target equilibrium design with 10 wt% enrichment and 12 g-HM/pebble the minimum initial HM-loading using mixed and top-bottom scheme was 97. 1 kg and 161. 9 kg, respectively.
