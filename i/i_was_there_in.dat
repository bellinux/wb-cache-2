This was released in late 1975 and, unexpectedly, it reached the #1 position on the UK Albums Chart for the week ending 15 November. This recording has {{the distinction of being}} the only comedy album to ever top the UK Albums Chart. Boyce released several albums over the next few years, receiving further gold discs for The Incredible Plan in 1976, and I Know 'Cos <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> <b>There</b> <b>in</b> 1978.|$|E
25|$|As Boyce's {{popularity}} became established throughout Wales and the United Kingdom, {{he became}} involved in many side projects, including three books, several television series and televised concerts, and three multi-part television specials produced by Opix Films. His spoken and sung poetry was first collected in Max Boyce: His Songs and Poems in 1976, with an introduction by Barry John. The comic illustrations that accompany the poems were drawn by his friend Gren Jones of the South Wales Echo (who had also illustrated the cover of We All Had Doctors' Papers). This publication was followed up with a similar collection, <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> <b>There!,</b> <b>in</b> 1980.|$|E

[...] "In the mornings I {{would go into the}} office and start writing and after I had finished one song in a day, which was very high output for me, they'd {{come up to me and}} say: 'Give us another song!' And I'd say 'OK' – because I'm like that. They'd keep up the pressure so that I kept on writing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> their offices working like that for six or eight weeks and when I flew home to Manchester I went straight round to see my doctor. I was feeling sick and could not eat. The doctor told me: 'You are totally over-worked.' I don't think I've ever felt so depressed as I did when I came back from New York." ...|$|E

6000|$|One night I was waked up by folks hollering [...] "Fire!" [...] all around. I {{jumped up}} and dressed and {{went out of the}} hotel to enjoy the scene. When I see it was Mrs. Sampson's house, I gave forth a kind of yell, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> two minutes.|$|E

"I {{thought all}} this was over and done for," [...] said Shaw, busying himself with the cover, [...] "since Sir Thomas Cochrane swept along the Borneo coast with his {{squadron}} some years ago.

In the morning sunlight the whole appearance of the place seemed shabbier and dirtier than ever. Inside the sitting room, however, everything was different. My own flowers had apparently been supplemented by many others. Mr. Parker, as pink-and-white as usual, looking the very picture of content and good digestion, was smoking a large cigar and reading a newspaper. Eve was seated at the writing table, but she swung round at my entrance and held out both her hands.|$|E

60|$|It was, and {{no doubt}} still is, a desolate-looking spot, at any rate {{for most of the}} day when owing to the shadow of the {{surrounding}} hills, it receives but little sun. Everything about it, especially when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> a time of rain, seemed dank and miserable, although the flat floor of the kloof was clothed with a growth of tall, coarse grass, and weeds that bore an evil-smelling flower. Perhaps some sense of appropriateness had caused the Zulu kings to choose this lonesome, deathly-looking gorge as one of their execution grounds. At any rate many had been slain here, for skulls and the larger human bones, some of them black with age, lay all about among the grass, as they had been scattered by hyenas and jackals. They were particularly thick beneath and around the table-like rock that I have mentioned.|$|E
