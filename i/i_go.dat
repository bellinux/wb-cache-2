5|$|Following {{the release}} of It's a Feedelity Affair in 2006, Lindstrøm had become tired of {{producing}} dance remixes and average length vocal pieces. He began giving the artists and labels mixes with slower tempos. Lindstrøm also felt he was unwisely incorporating musical ideas into remixes instead of original works, which led to experiments with lengthier tracks for an original album. Four to five tracks were originally envisioned for Where You Go <b>I</b> <b>Go</b> Too, but only three were chosen.|$|E
5|$|I {{spend my}} time out in the open, on the shingle beach {{when the weather is}} bad or the fishing boats go out, or <b>I</b> <b>go</b> into the {{countryside}} which is very beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and, naturally I work all the time, and I believe that this year I am going to do some serious things.|$|E

5|$|Where You Go <b>I</b> <b>Go</b> Too was {{released}} by Smalltown Supersound on August 18, 2008 in the United Kingdom, and August 19 in the United States. A special edition was issued on December 23, 2008. The album featured a bonus disc with edited versions of the original tracks by frequent Lindstrøm collaborator Prins Thomas. Lindstrøm toured in Austria, Germany, Spain, and the United States that fall.|$|E
5|$|The first {{incarnation}} {{of my life}} was as a ruthless killer. I still live {{with a sense of}} sin over those I killed. I chased them and shot them down—such a horrible thing to do. Now, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to the kindergarten every day and interact with the children. I want to nurture kind and considerate hearts in all of them. Harada also traveled to the United Kingdom and United States to meet some of the American and British airmen he had fought against, including the American ace Joe Foss who {{is believed to have been}} the pilot who shot down his plane. As part of his travels Harada visited Santa Isabel Island, where he located the wreckage of his fighter and brought a section of it back to Japan.|$|E
5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E

25|$|Madonna {{approached}} me. We {{sat for a}} cup of tea {{and again}} {{for a cup of}} tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> by other things. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> by scripts. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> with what I think I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E

He's big, but he has a really good swing. It's not like a big guy. It's short, compact. It's not just the home runs. The guy has a pretty good idea how to hit.|$|E

25|$|Betty James {{insisted upon}} keeping the {{original}} Slinky affordable. In 1996, {{when the price}} ranged from $1.89 to $2.69, she told The New York Times: “So many children can’t have expensive toys, and I feel a real obligation to them. I’m appalled when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> Christmas shopping and $60 to $80 for a toy is nothing.” In 2008, Slinkys cost $4 to $5, and Slinky Dogs about $20.|$|E
25|$|The film is grandiose, horrible, showing monstrous crimes...regrettably, {{the film}} {{people here are}} putting me under {{pressure}} to finish {{the whole thing in}} ten days even though the film is barely finished. I hope I can get it all together. I'm living here like a monk, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to bed at 8 in the evening, eat and drink very little and don't feel at all at ease in this giant city with all the responsibility for the film.|$|E
25|$|The boy focuses his {{attention}} on some discarded orange peel suspended momentarily on the ocean surface; as they sink out of sight, he engages in “solipsistic contemplation. Teddy conveys his revelation to his parents: “After <b>I</b> <b>go</b> out this door, I may only exist {{in the minds of}} all my acquaintances…I may be an orange peel.” His mother and father, victims of their spiritual “immaturity”, are incapable of grasping his warning that they may never see him again. Salinger issues this Vedantic premonition to the reader as a clue to Teddy’s fate.|$|E

25|$|Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (recurring season 2, main cast season 3–5)– {{a crooked}} strip mall lawyer who {{represents}} Walt and Jesse. Odenkirk drew inspiration for Goodman from film producer Robert Evans. I thought about Robert Evans because I've listened to The Kid Stays in the Picture on CD. He's constantly switching up his cadence and his delivery. He emphasizes interesting words. He has loads of attitude {{in almost every}} line that he says. So when I rehearse the scenes alone I do my impersonation of Robert Evans to find those moments and turns. Then <b>I</b> <b>go</b> out and I do Saul.|$|E
25|$|In early 2013, Ringwald {{released}} Except Sometimes, a jazz record. It {{follows a}} tradition in jazz for the Ringwald family set by her father. “I {{grew up in a}} home filled with music and had an early appreciation of jazz since my dad was a jazz musician. Beginning at around age three I started singing with his band and jazz music has continued to be one of my three passions along with acting and writing. I like to say jazz music is my musical equivalent of comfort food. It's always where <b>I</b> <b>go</b> back to when I want to feel grounded,” Ringwald said in a statement.|$|E
25|$|As {{the men and}} Mimì dine at the cafe, Musetta, {{formerly}} Marcello's sweetheart, {{arrives with}} her rich (and elderly) government minister admirer, Alcindoro, whom she is tormenting. It is clear she has tired of him. To the delight of the Parisians and the embarrassment of her patron, she sings a risqué song (Musetta's waltz: Quando me'n vo'—"When <b>I</b> <b>go</b> along"), hoping to reclaim Marcello's attention. The ploy works; at the same time, Mimì recognizes that Musetta truly loves Marcello. To be rid of Alcindoro for a bit, Musetta pretends to be suffering from a tight shoe and sends him to the shoemaker to get her shoe mended. Alcindoro leaves, and Musetta and Marcello fall rapturously into each other's arms.|$|E

So <b>I</b> <b>went</b> into my career with my eyes open. Clyde E. Keeler ...|$|R
