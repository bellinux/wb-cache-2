40|$|Whereas {{conventional}} maps can {{be expressed}} as outward-expanding formulae with well-defined central features and relatively poorly defined edges, Constant Scale Natural Boundary (CSNB) maps have well-defined boundaries that result from natural processes and thus allow spatial and dynamic relationships to be observed {{in a new way}} useful to understanding these processes. CSNB mapping presents a new approach to visualization that produces maps markedly different from those produced by conventional cartographic methods. In this approach, any body can be represented by a 3 D coordinate system. For a regular body, with its surface relatively smooth on the scale of its size, locations of features can be represented by definite geographic <b>grid</b> (<b>latitude</b> and longitude) and elevation, or deviation from the triaxial ellipsoid defined surface. A continuous surface on this body can be segmented, its distinctive regional terranes enclosed, and their inter-relationships defined, by using selected morphologically identifiable relief features (e. g., continental divides, plate boundaries, river or current systems). In this way, regions of distinction on a large, essentially spherical body can be mapped as two-dimensional ‘facets’ with their boundaries representing regional to global-scale asymmetries (e. g., continental crust, continental and oceanic crust on the Earth, farside original thicker crust and nearside thinner impact punctuated crust on the Moon). In an analogous manner, an irregular object such as an asteroid, with a surface that is rough on the scale of its size, would be logically segmented along edges of its impact-generated faces. Bounded faces are imagined with hinges at occasional points along boundaries, resulting in a foldable ‘shape model. ’ Thus, bounded faces grow organically out of the most compelling natural features. Obvious boundaries control the map’s extremities, and peripheral regions are not dismembered or grossly distorted as in conventional map projections. 2 D maps and 3 D models grow out of an object’s most obvious face or terrane ‘edges,’ instead of arbitrarily by imposing a regular grid system or using regularly shaped facets to represent an irregular surface...|$|E

The test is {{defined in terms of}} a steady-state solution to the equations of motion and an overlaid perturbation that triggers a baroclinically unstable wave. The steady-state initial conditions are zonally symmetric. Therefore, the test case design has the potential to favor models that are built upon regular latitude-longitude or Gaussian grids. Here we suggest rotating the computational grid so that the balanced flow is no longer aligned with the computational <b>grid</b> <b>latitudes.</b> Ideally the simulations should be invariant under rotation of the computational grid. Note that the test case only requires an adjustment of the Coriolis parameter in the model code. The rotated test case has been exercised by six dynamical cores. In addition, two of the models have been tested with different vertical coordinates resulting in a total of eight model variants. The models are built with different computational grids (regular latitude-longitude, cubed-sphere, icosahedral hexagonal/ triangular) and use very different numerical schemes. The test-case is a useful tool for debugging, assessing the degree of anisotropy in the numerical methods and grids, and evaluating the numerical treatment of the pole points since the rotated test case directs the flow directly over the geographical poles. Special treatments such as polar filters are therefore more exposed in this rotated test case. DOI: 10. 3894 /JAMES. 2010. 2. 15 1...|$|R

The dense haze came from forest and peat fires mainly occurred in Indonesia. Recent fires in Indonesia have become an annual phenomenon nevertheless rapid deforestation rate showed declined trend. In addition, Indonesia formally admitted very large amount of CO 2 emission mostly from fires and deforestation (about 3. 01 billion tonnes after the United States). Indonesia is now requested to reduce {{air pollution}} due to haze and carbon emissions at the same time.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the United States Department of Defense, {{together}} with scientists of other institutions and countries, {{began to develop}} the needed world system to which geodetic data could be referred and compatibility established between the coordinates of widely separated sites of interest. Efforts of the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force were combined leading to the DoD World Geodetic System 1960 (WGS 60).

Heritage surveying methods found elevation differences from a local horizontal determined by the spirit level, plumb line, or an equivalent device that depends on the local gravity field (see physical geodesy). As a result, the elevations in the data are referenced to the geoid, a surface that is not readily found using satellite geodesy. The latter observational method is more suitable for global mapping. Therefore, a motivation, and a substantial problem in the WGS and similar work is to patch together data that were not only made separately, for different regions, but to re-reference the elevations to an ellipsoid model rather than to the geoid.|$|R
40|$|The {{circumference}} of a latitude circle decreases toward the Poles, {{making it difficult}} to present meteorological field variables on equally spaced grids with respect to latitude and longitude because of data aggregation. To identify the best method for displaying data at the Poles, three different grids are compared that have all been designed to reduce data aggregation: the reduced latitude–longitude (RL) grid, the National Snow and Ice Data Center Equal-Area Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) Earth (EA) grid, and the National Meteorological Center octagonal (OG) grid. The merits and disadvantages of these grids are compared in terms of depictions of the Arctic summer circulation with wind vectors, streamfunction, and velocity potential at 400 hPa where maximum westerlies are located. Using geostrophy, the 400 -hPa streamfunction at high latitudes can be formed from geopotential height. In comparison with this geostrophic streamfunction, the streamfunction generated from vorticity on the OG grid shows a negligible error (∼ 0. 5 %). The error becomes larger using vorticity on the EA (∼ 15 %) and RL (∼ 30 %) grids. During the northern summer, the Arctic circulation at 400 hPa is characterized by three troughs. The streamfunction and velocity potential of these three troughs are spatially in quadrature with divergent (convergent) centers located ahead of (behind) these troughs. These circulation features are best depicted by the streamfunction and velocity potential generated on the OG grid. It is demonstrated by these findings that the National Meteorological Center octagonal grid is the most ideal among the three grids used for the polar regions. However, this assessment is constrained by the hemispheric perspective of meteorological field variables, because these variables depicted on the octagonal <b>grid</b> at higher <b>latitudes</b> need to be merged with those on the equal-latitude-longitude <b>grid</b> at lower <b>latitudes...</b>|$|R

The map uses the Classical Latin letter [...] "V" [...] instead of [...] "U".|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: For {{the purpose}} of climate signal detection, we {{introduce}} a method for identifying significant episodes of large-scale oscillatory variability. The method {{is based on a}} multivariate wavelet algorithm that identifies coherent patterns of variation simultaneously within particular ranges of time and periodicity (or frequency) that may vary regionally in the timing and amplitude of the particular temperature oscillation. By using this methodology, an analysis is performed of the instrumental record of global temperatures spanning the past 140 years. The duration of an “episode ” is chosen to correspond to 3 – 5 cycles at a specified oscillation period, which is useful for detecting signals associated with the global El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. To confirm the robustness of signals detected in the earliest, sparse data (only 111 5 ° longitude by 5 ° <b>latitude</b> <b>grid</b> points are available back to 1854), we performed multiple analyses overlapping in time, using increasingly dense subsets of the full (1570 grid point) temperature data. In every case, significant interannual episodes are centered in the 3 – 7 year period range corresponding to the conventional band of ENSO-related variance an...|$|R
40|$|This is an unreviewed manuscript, {{primarily}} {{intended for}} informal {{exchange of information}} among NMC staff members. Performance Test of the Movable-Area Fine-Mesh Model in the Western Pacific During {{the last six years}} at the National Meteorological Center (MMC), a project to develop a numerical model capable of forecasting hurricane (typhoon) movements has been under-way. This project has been very successful and has resulted in the development and operational implementation of a primitive-equation, analysis-forecast system, the Movable-Area Fine-Mesh Model (MFM), capable of producing forecasts of either hurricane tracks or large-scale heavy precipitation. A performance test using the MFM was conducted on selected storms from the Western Pacific- 1977 Typhoon Storm Season. The objective of the experiment was to evaluate the performance of the 'M t in the Western Pacific where a sparsity of data and large storms exist. The ifnitial analysis came fxom the Oper-ational Spectral Analysis System. From this analysis a 48 -hour Northern Hemisphere Six-Layer Primitive Equation Model forecast on a 381 km (true at 60 ° <b>latitude)</b> <b>grid</b> was generated to provide boundary conditions for the MFM. Forecast results are verified against the Joint Typhoon Warning Center provided typhoon positions. I...|$|R
40|$|Seismic data is {{difficult}} to analyze and classical mathematical tools reveal strong limitations in exposing hidden relationships between earthquakes. In this paper, we study earthquake phenomena in the perspective of complex systems. Global seismic data, covering the period from 1962 up to 2011 is analyzed. The events, characterized by their magnitude, geographic location and time of occurrence, are divided into groups, either according to the Flinn-Engdahl (F-E) seismic regions of Earth or using a rectangular <b>grid</b> based in <b>latitude</b> and longitude coordinates. Two methods of analysis are considered and compared in this study. In a first method, the distributions of magnitudes are approximated by Gutenberg-Richter (G-R) distributions and the parameters used to reveal the relationships among regions. In the second method, the mutual information is calculated and adopted {{as a measure of}} similarity between regions. In both cases, using clustering analysis, visualization maps are generated, providing an intuitive and useful representation of the complex relationships that are present among seismic data. Such relationships might not be perceived on classical geographic maps. Therefore, the generated charts are a valid alternative to other visualization tools, for understanding the global behavior of earthquakes...|$|R
