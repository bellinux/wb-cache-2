50|$|In other words, a <b>holddown</b> keeps {{a router}} from {{receiving}} route updates until the network {{appears to be}} stableâ€”until either an interface stops changing state (flapping) or a better route is learned.|$|E
5000|$|If {{there are}} {{matching}} entries but the hop count metric {{is higher than}} the one already in its routing table, then the routing entry is updated with hop count of 16 (infinite hop). The packets are still forwarded to the old route. A <b>Holddown</b> timer is started and all the updates for that from other routers are ignored. If after the <b>Holddown</b> timer expires and still the router is advertising with the same higher hop count then the value is updated into its routing table. Only after the timer expires, the updates from other routers are accepted for that route.|$|E
50|$|The Space Shuttle {{assembly}} {{was held}} to the MLP at eight <b>holddown</b> points using large studs, four on the aft skirt of each Solid Rocket Booster. Immediately before SRB ignition, frangible nuts attached {{to the top of}} these studs were detonated, releasing the Shuttle assembly from the platform.|$|E
50|$|If these updates are lost, some nodes in {{the network}} would not be {{informed}} that a route is invalid, so they could attempt to send packets over the bad route and cause a problem known as a routing loop. Therefore route poisoning is {{used in conjunction with}} <b>holddowns</b> to keep update messages from falsely reinstating the validity of a bad route. This prevents routing loops, improving the overall efficiency of the network.|$|R
50|$|Neodymium magnets, {{invented in}} the 1980s, are {{the strongest and}} most {{affordable}} type of rare-earth magnet. They are made of an alloy of neodymium, iron, and boron (Nd2Fe14B), sometimes abbreviated as NIB. Neodymium magnets are used in numerous applications requiring strong, compact permanent magnets, such as electric motors for cordless tools, hard disk drives, magnetic <b>holddowns,</b> and jewelry clasps. They have the highest magnetic field strength and have a higher coercivity (which makes them magnetically stable), {{but they have a}} lower Curie temperature, m and are more vulnerable to oxidation than samarium-cobalt magnets. Corrosion can cause unprotected magnets to spall off a surface layer, or to crumble into a powder. Use of protective surface treatments such as gold, nickel, zinc, and tin plating and epoxy resin coating can provide corrosion protection.|$|R
50|$|Newer distance-vector routing {{protocols}} (BGP, EIGRP, DSDV, Babel) have built-in loop prevention: they use algorithms that assure that routing loops can never happen, not even transiently. Older {{routing protocols}} (RIP) do not implement the newest forms of loop prevention and only implement mitigations such as split horizon, route poisoning, <b>holddown</b> timer, Trigger Update and Define maximum hops.|$|E
50|$|Holddowns {{are usually}} {{implemented}} with timers. If the router detects a network unreachable, the timer is started. The router will then wait a preset number of seconds until {{the network is}} stable. When the timer expires, the router will then receive its routing updates from other routers. For example, in RIP the default <b>holddown</b> timer is set to 180 seconds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Holddown</b> timer {{works by}} having each router start a timer {{when they first}} receive {{information}} about a network that is unreachable. Until the timer expires, the router will discard any subsequent route messages that indicate the route is in fact reachable. It can solve the case where multiple routers are connected indirectly. There are realistic scenarios where Split horizon and split horizon with poisoned reverse can do nothing.|$|E
50|$|RIP is a routing {{protocol}} that converges so slowly {{that even a}} network of a few routers can {{take a couple of}} minutes to converge. In case of a new route being advertised, triggered updates can speed up RIP's convergence but to flush a route that previously existed takes longer due to the <b>holddown</b> timers in use. OSPF {{is an example of a}} fast-converging {{routing protocol}}. A network of a few routers can converge in a matter of seconds.|$|E
50|$|The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} distance-vector routing {{protocols}} which employ the hop count as a routing metric. RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. The maximum number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of networks that RIP can support. A hop count of 16 is considered an infinite distance and the route is considered unreachable. RIP implements the split horizon, route poisoning and <b>holddown</b> mechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being propagated.|$|E

40|$|In the 1980 s, APA {{developed}} a portal frame concept, {{which can be}} site-built using standard sheathing and lumber, to create a semi-rigid moment frame. The advantage of portal frames {{is that they can}} resist relatively high lateral loads from narrow wall widths. A pair of the portal frames used for garage fronts is commonly used for prescriptive construction in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. In the 2000 s, extensive cyclic testing was conducted on this system such that design values could be determined for engineering applications. Additional prescriptive solutions were also developed, which included using the portal frames without the large <b>holddown</b> straps and using this portal on a raised floor system. Finally, the modern concrete codes, ACI- 318 (2011), require one to consider the effects of cracked concrete on anchorage for use in areas subjected to significant seismic forces. This code requirement effectively reduced the capacities of the hold down straps in high seismic regions. Consequentially, in 2012, an additional series of full-scale wall tests were conducted by APA to confirm the effect from reduced strap capacity on the capacities of the portal frames...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the structural design {{and analysis of}} the Brazilian Scientific Applications Satellite (SACI- 1) that is devised as a multipurpose bus for scientific applications. The structure includes a Mainbody (Platform and Payload), an Adapter, four deployable panels and the <b>holddown</b> and release mechanisms (HDR). Its overall shape resembles a parallelepiped measuring 600 x 400 x 400 mm (Main body only) and weighting about 65 kg (Mainbody plus Adapter). The Platform consists on a pack of 9 aluminum ribbed frames of different thickness stacked horizontally and connected by means of 12 stud bolts. The Payload is assembled {{on the top of the}} Platform and has six ribbed plates that form a box in which most of the payload is assembled. The separation is accomplished by cutting (or releasing) one central rod that joins the Platform to the Adapter. The analysis of this structure was performed using a FEM model for static, normal modes, frequency response, transient response and random vibration analysis. With these results it was possible: (a) to verify the preliminary design of the structure and define the necessary changes; (b) to determine the first global frequencies of the assembly and; (c) to verify the accelerations on the printed circuit boards...|$|E
40|$|Strains at twenty-one {{selected}} {{points in}} the critical lower weld region of a aft skirt of a solid rocket booster of the shuttle were measured using photoelastic coatings and stress separator gages. Data were taken at loads of 5, 14, 20, 28, 42, 56, and 70 percent of the design limit load. Results indicate that general yielding occurred in the weld metal and for a short distance outside the fusion boundaries {{on either side of}} the weld metal. The fusion boundaries did not yield at the 70 percent load. Slight non-linearity in the load strain curves were observed at several points above the 20 percent load level. Maximum measured strains occurred at {{points in the}} forged metal of the <b>holddown</b> post along a line 0. 50 inches from the centerline of the weld. Maximum shearing strains within the area covered by the photoelastic coating occurred at points approximately 0. 33 inches to the right of the weld centerline near points 6 and 7 and lying along a yellow vertical line extending from just below point 6 to point 11. Photoelastic coatings were shown to be an excellent method to provide the whole field strain distribution in the region of the critical weld and to enhance the overall understanding of the behavior of the welded joint...|$|E
40|$|A {{confirming}} {{check was}} performed to verify that the fuel assembly structural integrity is not impacted by the TPBARs. The structural adequacy of Westinghouse fuel assembly design is evaluated using NRC requirements for combined seismic and LOCA loads per Appendix A to the SRP 4. 2 and the approved methodology (Reference 1). The grid load results for the fuel assembly design in Watts Bar Unit 1 were reviewed. Based on the combined seismic and LOCA grid load there is a sufficient amount of grid load margin. The total weight for 24 TPBARs plus the <b>holddown</b> assembly is approximately 62 lbs, which is approximately 4 % {{of the weight of}} a typical fuel assembly. Because the TPBAR assembly is a hanging structure supported by the top nozzle adapter plate of the fuel assembly and the rodlets are hanging in the guide thimble tubes, the added weight can be considered {{to be a part of}} the fuel assembly nozzle support. The added TPBAR assembly weight, together with the rodlet stiffness, has an insignificant effect on the fuel assembly's dynamic characteristics. Therefore, the design basis analyses/evaluations performed for the fuel assembly structural integrity assessment for Watts Bar remain applicable. Furthermore, it is concluded that the LOCA and seismic combined loads will not be affected for Watts Bar Unit 1 containing TPBARs...|$|E
40|$|Blasting is {{a common}} {{technique}} employed in Australian mines and quarries {{to aid in the}} process of rock extraction. Airblast and ground vibrations caused by blasting may travel to residential areas where the dominant residential construction type is brick veneer. Two important modes of excitation that occur in walls of houses from blast vibrations are flexural and in-plane racking. The latter is widely recognised as having a greater damage potential and forms the focus of this research project. This paper reports on part of an experimental program involving the testing of two 3 m long by 2. 4 m high walls with penetrations of varying size, subjected to in-plane racking load. The test setup incorporates a shear load applied at the top of each wall with uplift restrained by a <b>holddown</b> mechanism. Deformation in the walls including cracking was measured at more than 400 locations across the face of each wall using digital photogrammetry. The resulting crack pattern is reported along with the development of cracking with increasing drift. The applied load was increased in cycles until a drift of approximately 2. 1 % was achieved. A comparison is drawn between the deformation results and damage categories specified in the Australian Standard for Residential Slabs and Footings (AS 2870 - 1996). The experimental outcomes reported here will be used to identify damage thresholds for brick veneer residences. Knowledge from these tests will also be used to correlate damage with the severity of various contributing loads to the initiation and propagation of cracking in houses...|$|E

The main goals of the ARA Mk 4 development program are solar array cost and risk reduction, robustness, performance increase and readiness for growth capability. The requirements for the ARA Mk 4 solar array are enveloping the needs for a number of intended applications such as EDRS-C, GMP-T, MetOp-SG and Geostar- 3. Furthermore the requirements are based on launch with todayâ€™s launchers. The EDRS-C program has been the first customer for the ARA Mk 4 solar array.

40|$|The Space Shuttle is {{connected}} to the mobile launch platform (MLP) by four aft skirt hold down studs on each solid rocket booster (SRB). Prior to lift-off, the frangible nuts inside the aft skirt blast containers are severed into two nut halves by two pyrotechnic booster cartridges. This action releases the Space Shuttle and allows the hold down studs to eject through the aft skirt bore and then down into the MLP. USBI has been tasked to upgrade the blast container for two specific reasons: (1) To eliminate lead for environmental concerns, and (2) To reduce the chance of nut recontact with the <b>holddown</b> stud. Nut recontact with the stud has been identified as a likely contributor to stud hang-ups.

Additional benefits of using the open cell, energy absorbent aluminum foam in place of the solid lead liner are: (1) Lead handling / exposure and possible contamination, along with hazardous waste disposal, will be eliminated; (2) Approximately 200 lbs. weight savings will be contributed to each Space Shuttle flight by using aluminum foam instead of lead; (3) The new aluminum liner is designed to catch all shrapnel from frangible nuts, thus virtually eliminating chance of debris exiting the HDP and causing potential damage to the vehicle; (4) Using the lighter aluminum liner instead of lead, allows for easier assembly and disassembly of blast container elements, which also improves safety, operator handling, and the efficiency of operations...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{cycling test}} {{was required to}} verify {{the integrity of the}} welded joints and the thin wall tube bends in the primary loop manifold assembly of a four pack thermo electric module and to help establish structural and mechanical requirements of any possible redesign. The test section was subjected to more severe loading conditions than will be experienced during actual operating conditions. The test was a mechanical simulation of the differential thermal expansion which occurs due to the approximately 600 {degrees} F temperature differential in the subassembly. The actual load exerted on the test section represented this deflection. The effects on the joints and tube material were observed. The test was conducted on a test segment of manifold designed to duplicate two of the flexible elbows; the transition joints between the elbows and the tubular module inner clad; and the welded joints of the elbows to the primary loop header. The assembled test segment and hold-down bracket are shown. The bracket was mounted {{to the base of the}} Universal Test Machine. Dial indicators measured the relative displacement between the line of applied load (through the vertical axis of the primary loop header) and the attachment point at the <b>holddown</b> bracket. In the first test, the load was applied in fifty pound increments until the relative displacement of nine mils was measured between the loop header and the welded joint on the feedline elbow. The remaining tests were cycling the header assembly at increasing relative displace ment. The summary of these tests are tabulated.

The new aluminum liner is designed to catch all shrapnel from frangible nuts thus virtually eliminating chance of foreign object debris (FOD) exiting the HDP, and causing potential damage to the vehicle; D. Potential of using the lighter aluminum liner over lead, allows for easier assembly and disassembly of blast container elements, also allowing for improvements in safety, operator handling, and efficiency of operations. Six BC firing tests will be required to determine if the new liner material will perform in a way to decrease the chance of stud hangups and enhance the ability of the BC to retain blast debris. Testing will be performed at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) facility known as the Launch Equipment Test Facility (LETF), and will simulate the SRB hold- down post, with actual BC hardware and pyrotechnics assembled, and then test fired. Initial testing was performed in 1997 using a frangible nut in a static drop test over lead and aluminum foam sheet materials. The aluminum foam showed a dramatic improvement of energy absorption over the lead liner material. Proof-of-Principle testing at the KSC-LETF commenced in May, 1998, and is expected to be completed by June, 1998...|$|E
