Though she is charming, she has certain immoral views and opinions which mean <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>that</b> she loses Edmund. She is often kind to Fanny Price, but is not a reliable friend. She is aware of her brother Henry's plan to toy with Fanny's heart, but does nothing to discourage him or warn Fanny. Fanny believes her to be driven primarily by mercenary considerations.|$|E
25|$|Frightened, Pi {{constructs}} a small raft out {{of rescue}} flotation devices, tethers {{it to the}} bow of the boat and makes it his place of retirement. He begins conditioning Richard Parker to take a submissive role by using food as a positive reinforcer, and seasickness as a punishment mechanism, while using a whistle for signals. Soon, Pi asserts himself as the alpha animal, and is eventually able to share the boat with his feline companion, admitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>that</b> Richard Parker is the one who helped him survive his ordeal.|$|E

The shark then causes {{the boat to}} break apart with its death contortions, forcing {{the people on the}} boat to jump off to avoid going down with it. American audiences disapproved of this ending. A new ending was ordered shot for foreign distribution with the shark getting stabbed with the bow sprit and then exploding; and with Jake being found wounded but alive. This version is what Universal used on home media releases.|$|R
25|$|Nariakira {{arrived in}} Satsuma {{to attempt to}} resolve the Ryūkyū crisis, as per the orders of shogunal high {{official}} Abe Masahiro, on June 25, 1846. A French ship had arrived in Ryūkyū in 1844, and two British ships the following year, demanding treaties of amity and commerce; as the kingdom was semi-independent and not generally regarded {{to be part of}} Japan proper, this presented a dilemma. Nariakira and Abe Masahiro decided <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>that,</b> despite the shogunate's policies of seclusion, such relations should be allowed in Ryūkyū, rather than risking violent conflict with the Western powers.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{unreliable}} narrators {{often appear}} in detective novels and thrillers, where even a first-person narrator might hide essential information and deliberately mislead the reader {{in order to}} preserve the surprise ending. In some cases, the narrator describes himself or herself as doing things which seem questionable or discreditable, only to reveal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>that</b> such actions were not what they seemed (e.g. Alistair MacLean's The Golden Rendezvous and John Grisham's The Racketeer). Crime novelist Jim Thompson used the device of a narrator who is belatedly revealed to be psychotic and possibly delusional repeatedly in his books, most notably The Killer Inside Me, Savage Night, A Hell of a Woman, and Pop. 1280.|$|E
500|$|Amidst all of {{this family}} turmoil, Imlay still found time to ponder larger social issues. The utopian socialist Robert Owen came to visit Godwin {{in the summer of}} 1816 and he and Imlay {{discussed}} the plight of the working poor in Britain. She agreed with many of Owen's proposals, but not all of them. She decided, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>that</b> his utopian scheme was too [...] "romantic", because it depended heavily on the goodwill of the rich to sacrifice their wealth. That same summer, George Blood—the brother of Fanny Imlay's namesake—came to meet {{her for the first time}} and told her stories of her mother. After this meeting she wrote to Mary Godwin and Shelley: [...] "I have determined never to live to be a disgrace to such a mother...

500|$|The {{narrator of}} the song worries that the girl he is {{addressing}} will ignore him because {{he has nothing to}} give her; likewise, the song's audience in the 1980syoung students and workerswere also suffering from not having resources to marry, to be with their girlfriends and boyfriends, or to attract members of the opposite sex. [...] The lyrics also express Western concepts of individualism, and were some of the first popular song lyrics in China to promote self-expression and self-empowerment. This put the song in stark contrast with older music, which had emphasized conformity and obedience. As the narrator, later on in the song, confidently proclaims to the girl that he will [...] "grab her hands" [...] ("") and then she will go with him (""), he suggests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>that</b> she can love {{the fact that he has}} nothing (""). On one level, this suggests that the song is about [...] "love conquering all", but the line has also been interpreted as threatening, and suggestive of an unorthodox and [...] "Dionysian" [...] mix of love and aggression.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} build support early in the campaign, Hunter participated in local straw polls. On March 1, at the Spartanburg, South Carolina poll, Hunter {{finished}} a close third in a statistical tie with McCain and Giuliani. The showing impressed Spartanburg Republican Gerald Emory who referred to Hunter as, [...] "a true Ronald Reagan conservative that we can support." [...] The following month he won the Anderson County, South Carolina straw poll and tied for second place in both the Greenwood County and Pickens County straw polls. Hunter thanked the counties for their support, which he claimed provided [...] "a huge boost." [...] He added, [...] "t is clear our message of maintaining a strong national defense, securing our border without amnesty, holding China accountable on trade, and protecting life are resonating with the voters. Our campaign is one of issues, not flash and expense. We don't have a jet or an army of consultants and paid staff. We do have the conservative message that is true. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>that</b> will be what Americans want." ...|$|E
500|$|Props {{specialist}} Ken Hawryliw {{claimed the}} biggest challenge in producing the episode was finding Christmas paper from the 1980s for the flashback sequences. Casting director Corrine Mays had difficulty finding an actress to play Dana Scully's 1976 self before executive producer Robert Goodwin {{came up with the}} idea of using Gillian Anderson's fourteen-year-old sister Zoë for the role. Gillian Anderson, while liking the finalized episode, believed that she never was able to capture the complex relationship between herself and Emily, stating: [...] "I felt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>that</b> I was a little low energy, a little too melancholy. It was hard to find the right attitude for Scully in dealing with a child that's apparently hers; to find the right flavor of relationship to her and this disease she's going through, all mixed up with the aspect of the paranormal." [...] Anderson also admitted that another issue she had was that [...] "she had no history with this child" [...] so she was unable to [...] "play the kind of attachment I would feel if my own daughter, Piper, were going through the same thing.|$|E

500|$|During {{his four}} years at Michigan, Woolfolk had what one {{reporter}} described as [...] "a strange love-hate relationship" [...] with Coach Bo Schembechler. Woolfolk noted at the time Schembechler is a [...] "tough coach", and it was [...] "not easy at all" [...] playing for him. Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk's tendency to try to run around defenders rather than banging through them, resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once. But Schembechler said Woolfolk [...] "came of age" [...] in the November 1980 Ohio State game. After Woolfolk's MVP performance in the 1981 Rose Bowl helped Schembechler to his first bowl game victory, Bo complimented Woolfolk's powerful performance, noting: [...] "Butch {{can be a real}} load." [...] By the 1981 season, Schembechler was a true believer in Woolfolk, saying: [...] "Today, I can say without reservation, that I'd rather go into a big game with Woolfolk at tailback than any other back in the country." [...] Woolfolk, too, concluded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>that</b> Schembechler was [...] "key" [...] to his success: [...] "He kept after me. He kept saying I was getting too fancy. He kept saying, 'You're a big back, a fast back, and you ought to be running over people -- not trying to dance around them.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{critics were}} more {{favorable}} than {{not in their}} response to [...] "Mash Off". Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone felt that the series returned to form in the episode, and commented: [...] "We've said it before and we'll say it again: we like our Glee with just enough ridiculousness, and this week had it." [...] Entertainment Weekly journalist Abby West noted that she loved {{the fact that it}} [...] "was a bullying episode that snuck up on us". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal opined that [...] "Mash Off" [...] {{was one of the best}} installments of Glee, and cited the episode's storylines as highlights: [...] "The mash-up episodes every season can be hit or miss, but this year was perfected to the nth degree." [...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote that there was plenty of [...] "airy fun to be found" [...] in [...] "Mash Off", but added that [...] "underneath all the silly fake mustaches and snappy quotes about root-beer fountains and robot teachers beat a very dark baboon heart. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>that</b> murky, telltale undercurrent burst to the fore, like a ... slap in the face, leaving us gasping and a little confused." [...] Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson stated that it was [...] "surprisingly good", and that [...] "Mash Off" [...] was a [...] "solid hour of television that was bursting with fantastic musical numbers and some really gratifying narrative developments". Michael Slezak of TV Line said that the episode contributed to a revitalization of the quality of the show's third season.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, {{a lack of}} inter-cultural {{experience}} on both sides combined with the traditional Byzantine Soviet bureaucracy and way of business {{proved to be the}} dooming factors for the game.

2500|$|Sixty-three years later, in 1998, Johnson recreated his father’s {{journey with}} his two sons.

During {{the course of the}} film, Johnson reflects on his somewhat difficult relationship with his often-absent father as well as his own battle with alcoholism. Said Johnson of the journey, [...] "I started to get this idea that some people thought was crazy, but something was telling me to do it… to recreate my father’s airplane and retrace his journey.

2500|$|After {{secretly}} {{meeting with}} the Pullman Company, the NMB refused to follow precedent it had set {{in the case of}} a group of white railroad workers, and refused to act in behalf of the BSCP. [...] The NMB argued that the brotherhood was incapable of disrupting the Pullman sleeping car service. [...] Although the union had voted for a strike, the Pullman Company convinced the NMB that the union did not have the strength in numbers or resources to pull it off. In July 1928, the NMB formally retired the case and Randolph called off the strike just hours before it was scheduled to begin. [...] Randolph, Webster, and the leadership of the BSCP recognized, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>that</b> a strike at that time would have seriously crippled the brotherhood, agreeing that the union was still not strong enough to carry off a strike against the powerful corporate giant like Pullman.|$|E
2500|$|Generally {{the use of}} both a {{ring and}} a halter, and {{management}} of the bull by two people, is the preferred method today for controlling the bull. [...] Typically, a bull was led by a wooden staff with a steel end that snapped into the ring. A long rigid steel or wooden bull staff locked into the ring could also be used to push a bull out of a pen without requiring the handler to enter the pen for cleaning or feeding. Because of the risk that the bull may drive the staff into the handler if the bull misbehaves many handlers prefer to avoid their use nowadays. [...] One current veterinary text still recommends the use of a staff in addition to the halter: Many handlers rely on a nose ring to control a bull. [...] But a ring in his nose is no good unless you have a bull staff and use it. [...] A bull staff is a pole with a snap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>that</b> clips to the bull ring. [...] Leading a bull with a staff gives you a lot more handling power as the bull can't get any closer to you than the length of the staff allows. Leading him only by a chain in the ring lets him run over you at will.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998 Heinze {{wrote an}} opinion {{piece for the}} Examiner, [...] "The Vatican Repents Catholic Anti-Semitism;" [...] it focused on the long-awaited and newly {{released}} document, , published by Cardinal Edward Cassidy, President of the Pontifical Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews. The document had caused heated controversy; many critics argued that it didn't go far enough in taking responsibility for the past. Heinze's Examiner article opened {{with the story of}} Bernard Lichtenberg, a Catholic priest who was arrested in 1941 by the Berlin Gestapo because he had publicly prayed for the Jews; after his arrest, Lichtenberg asked to be sent away with the Jews so that he could pray for their welfare. He spent the next two years in a Nazi prison camp and died on his way to Dachau. After telling the story of Father Lichtenberg, Heinze gave his opinion of the We Remember document. He agreed with the critics that [...] "The Catholic Church must reckon with historical fact, proving its awareness of sin in high places." [...] "But," [...] he added, [...] "the rest of us must encourage the message of repentance and renewal the church is preaching to its followers because, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>that</b> is what produces people such as Bernard Lichtenberg." [...] It was an opinion piece that encouraged reconciliation, not anger. Two years later Heinze invited Cardinal Cassidy to San Francisco to participate in a Swig [...] lecture on interfaith understanding. Cardinal Cassidy accepted the invitation.|$|E
