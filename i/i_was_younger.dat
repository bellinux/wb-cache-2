He also incorporates Greek legend, notably the tale of Aeschylus and the Eumenides—or Furies—found in the Oresteia, suggested by the broad wings of the chimera. Bacon's imagery became less extreme and more imbued with pathos as he got older, and fewer of his canvases contain the sensational imagery that made him famous in the mid-1940s. He admitted that, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>younger,</b> I needed extreme subject-matter. Now I don't."

500|$|One notable {{feature of}} the comic is the {{blending}} of mythological elements from many different cultural traditions, especially from the British Isles and Native American mythology.

[...] In addition to mythology, Siddell makes heavy use of alchemical themes; for example, the main character is named Antimony, after a toxic chemical element, and many pages feature artistic depictions of alchemical symbols. The symbol for antimony appears frequently in Gunnerkrigg Court: the character Antimony wears a necklace shaped like that symbol, the character Reynardine has the symbol imprinted on his wolf body, and the symbol is used to mark the end of a chapter.|$|E

[...] His first {{television}} appearance was in 1994, where he performed {{as a part of}} a one-hour ABC primetime special entitled Secrets. One of the early supporters of Angel was horror director Clive Barker. In 1995, Barker asked Angel to work with him on his film Lord of Illusions. He also later recorded the intro to Angel's album World of Illusion: System One. Barker said of Angel in the mid-1990s that, [...] "Criss Angel is extraordinary, a spectacular mix of visionary magic. This is the future, and it can’t come quickly enough." [...] During that year, he collaborated with musician Klayton to form Angeldust, a show that combined magic with music. They released their first album Musical Conjurings from the World of Conjuring in 1998. Also that year, Angel performed a ten-minute show over the course of the [...] "World of Illusion" [...] conference in Madison Square Garden, performing sixty shows per day. However, by 2000, Klayton's name was removed from Angel's website.|$|E

In the week prior to the US opening of Sinister, Hawke explained that he was previously turned off by horror because good acting is not always required for success; however, the producer of Sinister, Jason Blum, who formerly ran a theater company with Hawke, made the offer to the actor based on the character and director."when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>younger,</b> I ran a theater company with this guy, Jason Blum.

Despite her father's leniency, her mother later chose to send her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In 2007, she told The Times that [...] "I had a great family life [...] I would never want it to look as if it reflected on them. I think I was very bored, and I did just love taking hallucinogens... but I often feel it's because I experimented when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> that I have no interest as an adult. I know a lot of adults who didn't, and it's much more dangerous when you start experimenting with drugs as an adult." [...] She often described herself as a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "depressed teenager". Her only extracurricular activity was occasionally skateboarding with her older brother, and she spent most of her free time in her bedroom: [...] "Mostly I sewed. I had nothing better to do, so I made my own clothes." ...|$|E

[...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God!

500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E
