25|$|The cinema's {{red brick}} {{exterior}} {{was designed to}} harmonise with the adjoining Turnpike Lane tube station. Above the main canopy over the entrance was an <b>illuminated</b> <b>sign</b> above which {{the name of the}} cinema was displayed in neon. The auditorium's decorative scheme was quite simple and consisted mainly of ornamental plasterwork decorated in green, gold and pink. There was a large cove-lit dome in the ceiling and seating was provided for 1,850 people. The cinema was also equipped with a stage, which was only occasionally used, and a cafe that was located over the entrance foyer in operation until the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|The {{market area}} was {{submerged}} and had approximately 150 stalls {{with the majority}} selling food. It was split by a large road which connected to the inner ring road which was built from 1967 till 1971. There was direct access to New Street station and the market area could be easily accessed from Moor Street station. A multi-storey car park was also located within the complex with 500 spaces for cars. Access to roads by foot could be achieved through a network of subways. As part of the development, a nine-storey office block designed by James A. Roberts was built. This {{was attached to the}} multi-storey car park. The floors were of reinforced concrete, 12inches in thickness. A bold <b>illuminated</b> <b>sign</b> by D.R.U. was located on the end wall, facing the city centre.|$|E
500|$|Cyrus, costumed as Montana, first {{performed}} [...] "Who Said", {{along with}} six other songs, at the concert taping {{for the first}} season of Hannah Montana.

It began with Cyrus entering from behind a huge, <b>illuminated</b> <b>sign</b> that spelled [...] "Hannah Montana". She then roamed throughout the stage singing the number. The performance was later released as the song's music video on April 10, 2006 on Disney Channel. Cyrus also performed the song on twenty dates in the fall of 2006, when she opened for the Cheetah Girls' 2006 and 2007 concert tour The Party's Just Begun Tour.|$|E
500|$|The {{first major}} {{addition}} to the building, a three-story office building with [...] of floor space primarily for the classified advertisements department, was completed to the west in 1947. The $125,000 project was postponed during World War II because of a shortage in materials, resulting in cramped conditions as circulation had, during the building's 16-year history, doubled to more than 175,000 daily and 225,000 on Sundays. A gold, <b>illuminated</b> <b>sign</b> with the Times logo in [...] letters was also placed atop the building's entrance on John Street. In 1950, the building was expanded to the north by [...] to accommodate a larger mailing room, {{as well as a}} new newsroom and offices for the Associated Press bureau and Sunday departments. A clock and temperature sign on the southeast corner of the building was installed in December 1959, with text reading [...] "Today's News Today"; it sparked comparisons to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer globe that was installed in 1948, used as symbols of each paper's philosophy. The clock was later changed to read [...] "Since 1896" [...] and a digital temperature display was added below; it was stopped permanently at 2:40 when the building was vacated.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with several}} other roads in the Highlands, the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe has been {{installed}} with permanent gates that are closed {{in the event of}} severe weather. These gates are now fitted with fibre-optic <b>illuminated</b> <b>signs.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Ever the {{innovative}} promoter, Fisher seemed tireless {{in his efforts}} to draw attention to Miami Beach, a story recounted by PBS. Fisher had acquired a baby elephant named [...] "Rosie" [...] who was a favorite with newspaper photographers. In 1921, he got free publicity all across the country with what we would call today a promotional [...] "photo-op" [...] of Rosie serving as a 'golf caddy' for vacationing President-elect Warren Harding. Billboards of bathing beauties enjoying white beaches and blue ocean waters appeared around the country. Fisher even purchased a huge <b>illuminated</b> <b>sign</b> proclaiming [...] "It's June in Miami" [...] in Times Square.|$|E
2500|$|The Minnesota Vikings' U.S. Bank Stadium faced {{a similar}} controversy; because the Minneapolis offices of Wells Fargo, a rival {{to the new}} stadium's naming rights sponsor U.S. Bank, are located within the {{vicinity}} of the stadium, Wells Fargo agreed to only install [...] "non-mounted," [...] non-illuminated signage on its building, such as letters painted directly onto the roof. After the original agreement was reached, Wells Fargo had asked the team to allow the installation of [...] "raised, illuminated lettering. mounted on beams more than a foot above the roof rather than painted on the roof as agreed upon". Such signage would be visible in overhead views of U.S. Bank Stadium (such as camera shots during event telecasts), Wells Fargo threatened to light the entire rooftops of its offices if the Vikings chose to deny the requested change. In December 2015, the Vikings sued Wells Fargo for violating the agreement, after they began to construct an <b>illuminated</b> <b>sign</b> on their rooftop. On June 23, 2016, Judge Donovan W. Frank ruled in favor of the Vikings, and ordered Wells Fargo to remove the raised, illuminated signage.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Kelley's politeness {{would not}} suffer the {{distinguished}} Colombian to brave {{the dangers of}} the return unaccompanied. At the door of the Hotel Español they paused. A little lower down {{on the opposite side of}} the street shone the modest <b>illuminated</b> <b>sign</b> of El Refugio. Mr. Kelley, to whom few streets were unfamiliar, knew the place exteriorly as a [...] "Dago joint." [...] All foreigners Mr. Kelley classed under the two heads of [...] "Dagoes" [...] and Frenchmen. He proposed to the General that they repair thither and substantiate their acquaintance with a liquid foundation.|$|E

6000|$|Now, [...] "my friend" [...] had rather {{another sound}} and significancy than [...] "mon ami;" [...] {{it did not}} breathe {{the same sense of}} {{domestic}} and intimate affection; [...] "mon ami" [...] I could not say to M. Paul; [...] "my friend," [...] I could, and did say without difficulty. This distinction existed not for him, however, and he was quite satisfied with the English phrase. He smiled. You should have seen him smile, reader; and you should have marked the difference between his countenance now, and that he wore half an hour ago. I cannot affirm that I had ever witnessed the smile of pleasure, or content, or kindness round M. Paul's lips, or in his eyes before. The ironic, the sarcastic, the disdainful, the passionately exultant, I had hundreds of times seen him express by what he called a smile, but any <b>illuminated</b> <b>sign</b> of milder or warmer feelings struck me as wholly new in his visage. It changed it as from a mask to a face: the deep lines left his features; the very complexion seemed clearer and fresher; that swart, sallow, southern darkness which spoke his Spanish blood, became displaced by a lighter hue. I know not that I have ever seen in any other human face an equal metamorphosis from a similar cause. He now took me to the carriage: at the same moment M. de Bassompierre came out with his niece.|$|E

2500|$|The theatres of Broadway and {{the huge}} number of {{animated}} neon and LED signs {{have been one of}} New York's iconic images as well {{as a symbol of the}} intensely urban aspects of Manhattan. Such signage is mandated by zoning ordinances that require building owners to display <b>illuminated</b> <b>signs,</b> the only district in New York City with this requirement. The neighborhood actually has a minimum limit for lighting instead of the standard maximum limit. The density of <b>illuminated</b> <b>signs</b> in Times Square rivals that in Las Vegas. Officially, signs in Times Square are called [...] "spectaculars", and the largest of them are called [...] "jumbotrons". This signage ordinance was implemented in accordance with guidelines set in a revitalization program that New York Governor Mario Cuomo implemented in 1993.|$|R

5000|$|The {{location}} of the depôt {{can be seen from}} across the sweep of Douglas Bay and is marked by a large <b>illuminated</b> <b>sign</b> with the words [...] "Electric Railway" [...] in the cliffs above the sheds. This was reinstated in 1993 as part of the Year Of Railways celebrations marking the line's centenary, previous incarnations having been removed several years previously. The site of today's sign once held a similar <b>illuminated</b> <b>sign</b> which read [...] "M.E.R. For Scenery", and a similar sign denoting the presence of Derby Castle was located on the hillside approximately behind the Strathallan Hotel (now the Terminus Tavern near the station). A Further sign in the same style was erected {{at the southern end of}} the White City amusement complex but this was removed in 1985.|$|E

5000|$|The {{principle}} of edge-lighting was discovered early {{and used for}} commercial signs. [...] for an [...] "Electric edge lit sign" [...] was filed on July 31, 1914, and granted in 1915. Other similar patents ( [...] , , , [...] ) for <b>illuminated</b> <b>signs</b> were filed 1928-1948. But the need for digit read-out arose with electronic computers in the 1950s with many independent inventions, both in edge-lighting, nixie tubes and other technologies.|$|R
50|$|Fraser ran {{a dental}} practice, and in 1936 he {{entered into a}} {{contract}} with Rayneon to lease a neon sign advertising his business. The lease was for a term of 5 years, however in the government passed the Dentists Advertising Regulations (1938) making any advertisements that were {{did not meet the}} requirements of the regulation illegal. In this case, Schedule 8, which covered <b>illuminated</b> <b>signs,</b> neon signs were not listed as being allowed, thus being illegal. As a result, the dentist ceased paying the remaining lease payments, claiming the contract was now not legally enforceable due to frustration.|$|R
