5|$|De Ravin's film {{credits include}} Santa's Slay (2005), The Hills <b>Have</b> <b>Eyes</b> (2006) and Ball Don't Lie (2008). She starred as Emily, the heroin-addicted ex-girlfriend of Brendan Frye, in the neo-noir film Brick (2005). She had a cameo in Public Enemies (2009) and more {{recently}} starred in Remember Me (2010). De Ravin has been included on Maxims Hot 100 list three times: in 2005 (No. 47), 2006 (No. 65), and 2008 (No. 68).|$|E

Weekend estimates showed that the film made $25.45 million over the weekend of March 23–25, 2007. The film grossed over $95 million worldwide, including over $54 million domestically during its 91-day run in the 3,120 North American theaters.|$|E
5|$|A year later, De Ravin had a {{lead role}} and was cast as Brenda Carter in the remake of The Hills <b>Have</b> <b>Eyes.</b> The film {{performed}} {{well at the}} box office. In 2007, Variety reported {{that she would be}} starring in the film Ball Don't Lie, which premiered at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, which arrived in cinemas early 2009. De Ravin appeared in William Dear's The Perfect Game, and appeared in the 2009 film Public Enemies as a bank teller named Barbara Patzke.|$|E

5|$|The head, having {{mouthparts}} projecting {{forward or}} sometimes downturned, is usually heavily sclerotized and is sometimes very large. The eyes are compound and may display remarkable adaptability, {{as in the}} case of the aquatic whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae), where they are split to allow a view both above and below the waterline. Longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) and weevils have divided eyes, while many <b>have</b> <b>eyes</b> that are notched, and a few have ocelli, small, simple eyes usually farther back on the head (on the vertex); these are more common in larvae than in adults. Ocelli are found in the adult carpet beetle (Dermestidae), some rove beetles (Omaliinae), and the Derodontidae.|$|E
5|$|Vision is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes <b>have</b> <b>eyes</b> suited to the dark environment.|$|E
5|$|Most {{worker and}} soldier {{termites}} are completely blind {{as they do}} not have a pair of eyes. However, some species, such as Hodotermes mossambicus, have compound eyes which they use for orientation and to distinguish sunlight from moonlight. The alates <b>have</b> <b>eyes</b> along with lateral ocelli. Lateral ocelli, however, are not found in all termites. Like other insects, termites have a small tongue-shaped labrum and a clypeus; the clypeus is divided into a postclypeus and anteclypeus. Termite antennae have a number of functions such as the sensing of touch, taste, odours (including pheromones), heat and vibration. The three basic segments of a termite antenna include a scape, a pedicel (typically shorter than the scape), and the flagellum (all segments beyond the scape and pedicel). The mouth parts contain a maxillae, a labium, and a set of mandibles. The maxillae and labium have palps that help termites sense food and handling.|$|E

25|$|Sea urchins are {{sensitive}} to touch, light, and chemicals. Although they do not <b>have</b> <b>eyes</b> or eye spots (except for diadematids, which can follow a threat with their spines), the entire body of most regular sea urchins might function as a compound eye. They also have statocysts, called spheridia, located within the ambulacral plates to help the animal remain upright.|$|E
25|$|H. irritans is the {{smallest}} of the biting muscids, gray in color, approximately in (4.0mm) in length. Both the male and female have slender, black, piercing mouthparts which project forward {{from the bottom of the}} head. They often aggregate densely on cattle, each fly oriented with its head in the same direction as hair tips of that site on the host. Horn flies typically <b>have</b> <b>eyes</b> that are dark reddish brown.|$|E

25|$|While most Cyphophthalmi are blind, eyes {{do occur}} in several groups. Many Stylocellidae, and some Pettalidae bear eyes near {{or at the}} base of the ozophores, as opposed to most harvestmen, which <b>have</b> <b>eyes</b> located on top. The eyes of Stylocellidae could have evolved from the lateral eyes of other arachnids, which have been lost in all other harvestmen. Regardless of their origin, it is thought that eyes were lost several times in Cyphophthalmi.|$|E

The dog, Xolo, is made from papier-mâché and steel. All three are controlled using ropes, pulleys and motors.|$|E
25|$|R. revolutionalis are small, dark, reddish brown wasps {{with body}} lengths of 8 to 10mm. When viewed closely, they have {{remarkable}} patterns on their bodies, and they <b>have</b> <b>eyes</b> with multiple lenses. They are slightly smaller than species {{from the family}} of Polistes. This is because their abdomens have a segment after the waist that is slimmer than the following segment. Although these wasps are not considered especially aggressive, they will sting if their nests are disturbed.|$|E

25|$|Glass frogs {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to some green frogs of the genus Eleutherodactylus and to some tree frogs of the family Hylidae. However, hylid tree frogs <b>have</b> <b>eyes</b> that face to the side, whilst those of glass frogs face forward. Some species of green tree frogs (especially juveniles), such as Hyloscirtus palmeri and Hypsiboas pellucens, have the transparent abdominal skin typical of glass frogs, {{but they also have}} calcars on the heels, a character not present in any species of the Centrolenidae.|$|E
25|$|Nocturnal birds <b>have</b> <b>eyes</b> {{optimised}} {{for visual}} sensitivity, with large corneas {{relative to the}} eye’s length, whereas diurnal birds have longer eyes relative to the corneal diameter to give greater visual acuity. Information about the activities of extinct species can be deduced from measurements of the sclerotic ring and orbit depth. For the latter measurement to be made, the fossil must have retained its three-dimensional shape, so activity pattern cannot be determined with confidence from flattened specimens like Archaeopteryx, which has a complete sclerotic ring but no orbit depth measurement.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eyes}} of most mammals, birds, reptiles, and most other {{terrestrial}} vertebrates (along with spiders and some insect larvae) the vitreous fluid has a higher refractive index than the air. In general, the lens is not spherical. Spherical lenses produce spherical aberration. In refractive corneas, the lens tissue is corrected with inhomogeneous lens material (see Luneburg lens), or with an aspheric shape. Flattening the lens has a disadvantage; the quality of vision is diminished away from the main line of focus. Thus, animals that have evolved with a wide field-of-view often <b>have</b> <b>eyes</b> that make use of an inhomogeneous lens.|$|E

25|$|Chenfrault's {{first film}} soundtrack work was on Celebration, which was {{directed}} by Olivier Meyrou. A documentary film about Yves Saint Laurent, Celebration was blocked from distribution by Pierre Bergé. Chanfrault composed the music for the 2003 film Haute Tension, which {{was directed by}} Alexandre Aja. Cinezik noted Chanfrault created a strident and scary atmosphere on the film's soundtrack. Who Killed Bambi? directed by Gilles Marchand, featured compositions by Chanfrault and was released {{in the same year}} as Haute Tension. He composed the music for the 2005 film Beyond Hatred, which was directed by Olivier Meyrou. His work on the film was well received; a review by Variety praised François-Eudes Chanfrault's sparse, sorrowful, string-based score. Chanfrault's work on the music for the 2006 film The Hills <b>Have</b> <b>Eyes</b> directed by Alexandre Aja inspired the tone for the 2011 documentary Après la gauche by filmmaker Jeremy Forni.|$|E
25|$|In {{biological}} systems phenotype {{can be said}} to supervene on genotype. This is because any genotype encodes a finite set of unique phenotypes, but any given phenotype is not produced by a finite set of genotypes. Innumerable examples of convergent evolution can be used to support this claim. Throughout nature, convergent evolution produces incredibly similar phenotypes from a diverse set of taxa with fundamentally different genotypes underpinning the phenotypes. One example is evolution on islands which is a remarkably predictable example of convergent evolution where the same phenotypes consistently evolve for the same reasons. Organisms released from predation tend to become larger, while organisms limited by food tend to become smaller. Yet there are almost infinite numbers of genetic changes that might lead to changes in body size. Another example of convergent evolution is the loss of sight that almost universally occurs in cave fish living in lightless pools. Eyes are expensive, and in lightless cave pools there is little reason for fish to <b>have</b> <b>eyes.</b> Yet, despite the remarkably consistent convergent evolution producing sightless cave fish, the genetics that produce the loss of type phenotype is different nearly every time. This is because phenotype supervenes on genotype.|$|E
25|$|The Sorting Hat is a sapient {{artefact}} used at Hogwarts, {{which uses}} Legilimency (essentially, {{the ability to}} read minds) to determine which of the four school houses – Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin – each new student is to be assigned for their years at Hogwarts. The hat resembles a dilapidated conical leather wide-brimmed wizard's hat, with folds and tears that make it appear to <b>have</b> <b>eyes</b> and a mouth. During the opening banquet {{at the beginning of each}} school year, the Hat is placed on every first-year student's head. The Hat announces its choice aloud, and the student joins the selected house. The Hat speaks to the student while they're being sorted and is willing to take the student's preferences into account when it makes its decision. Sometimes it does not have the need to do so: for instance, the Hat barely touched Draco Malfoy's head before sending him to Slytherin. The Sorting Hat had a difficult time placing Harry, almost placing him into Slytherin house before he requested specifically and emphatically not to be. The Hat instead placed him into Gryffindor, the house of his parents. Rowling has stated the reason for the Hat's indecision as to which house to place him into was because it sensed the part of Voldemort's soul within Harry.|$|E
