5|$|As {{early as}} 1942, German flak commanders had already {{concluded}} that AAA would be essentially useless against jet aircraft, and began development of guided missiles to <b>fill</b> <b>this</b> role.

The UK's Green Mace {{was one of the}} last attempts to develop a useful high-altitude AAA weapon, but its development ended in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{announcement}} of a new Star Trek incarnation, Star Trek: Voyager co-creators Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor conceived the basic concepts and characters during secret developmental meetings. The Kazon were originally created {{as a part of}} the show's basic premise of Voyagers crew being stranded in the Delta Quadrant. Berman, Piller, and Taylor reasoned that the characters would be traveling through an area of space controlled by a new alien race, serving as the show's primary antagonists, and created the Kazon to <b>fill</b> <b>this</b> role.|$|E

5|$|Implementing the {{provisions}} and mandates of the Nunn-Cohen Act, however, was neither rapid nor smooth. One {{of the first}} issues to surface was appointing an ASD (SO/LIC), whose principal duties included monitorship of special operations activities and low-intensity conflict activities of the Department of Defense. The Congress even {{increased the number of}} assistant secretaries of defense from 11 to 12, but the Department of Defense still did not <b>fill</b> <b>this</b> new billet. In December 1987, the Congress directed Secretary of the Army John O. Marsh to carry out the ASD (SO/LIC) duties until a suitable replacement was approved by the Senate. Not until 18 months after the legislation passed did Ambassador Charles Whitehouse assume the duties of ASD (SO/LIC).|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the Florida Legislature {{recognized}} {{demands for}} higher education in South Florida by designating Florida Atlantic as the lead state university serving Broward County. To <b>fill</b> <b>this</b> role, the university would establish a campus in Dania Beach in 1997 and another campus in the City of Davie in western Broward County in 1990. Florida Atlantic later purchased 50 acres (20 ha) of land in Port St. Lucie in 1994 to establish a campus on the Treasure Coast. This would be the institution's fifth campus. The university continued its expansion in 1999 when it opened its Jupiter Campus, named for the late John D. MacArthur. This campus houses the university's honors college.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1989 season, All-Star safety Bennie Thompson {{left the}} Blue Bombers {{to join the}} New Orleans Saints of the National Football League, leaving an opening on the roster for a new {{starting}} safety. Allen was initially designated to <b>fill</b> <b>this</b> role, but it eventually went to Moustafa Ali. He found early success defensively, making two interceptions in his first five weeks. He also tied the CFL career record for fumbles recovered for touchdowns when he recovered his fourth career blocked punt in an August game against the Toronto Argonauts. In November of that year, Allen again blocked a punt which was recovered by Paul Clatney for a Blue Bombers touchdown. In addition to his large role on special teams, Allen contributed far more defensively in 1989 than he did in his rookie year, recording 27 tackles in 16 regular season games. The Blue Bombers again qualified for the playoffs, but lost to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 10â€“14 in the East Final.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Roman {{expansion}} into Spain and Gaul occurred as {{a mix of}} alliance-seeking and military occupation. In the 2nd century BC, Roman involvement in the Greek east remained a matter of alliance-seeking, but {{this time in the}} face of major powers that could rival Rome. According to Polybius, who sought to trace how Rome came to dominate the Greek east in less than a century, this was mainly a matter of several Greek city-states seeking Roman protection against the Macedonian kingdom and Seleucid Empire in the face of destabilisation created by the weakening of Ptolemaic Egypt. In contrast to the west, the Greek east had been dominated by major empires for centuries, and Roman influence and alliance-seeking led to wars with these empires that further weakened them and therefore created an unstable power vacuum that only Rome could <b>fill.</b> <b>This</b> had some important similarities to (and important differences from) the events in Italy centuries earlier, but this time on a global scale.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} oxygen is more {{difficult}} to calculate, as it is derived from two sources, the added oxygen and the air top-up. However, all of the nitrogen is provided by the air top-up, so the partial pressure of the nitrogen is calculated in a similar way as for helium, which allows the pressure of the air to be calculated, assuming nitrogen to be 79% of the air. In the Tx 20/40 example, the fraction of nitrogen is 100% - (20% + 40%) = 40%. The required partial pressure of nitrogen is therefore 230bar x 40% = 92bar, so the air top-up pressure is 92bar/79% = 116bar (for a 3,000psi <b>fill</b> <b>this</b> would be 3,000 x 40% / 79% = 1,500psi of air). The remaining pressure of 230bar - 92bar - 116bar = 22bar is the added oxygen pressure required for the mix (for a 3,000psi <b>fill</b> <b>this</b> would be 3,000 - 1,200 - 1,500 = 300psi of oxygen).|$|E
