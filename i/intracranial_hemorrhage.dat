5|$|Halfway {{through his}} fifth term in Parliament, on 21 November 1959, Meisdalshagen {{suffered}} from a sudden indisposition after a parliamentary speech. He was hospitalized, but died later that same day. The {{cause of death was}} <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> In Parliament he was replaced by Per Mellesmo, who advanced from deputy to regular representative. He was biographized in 1982 by Nils Oddvar Bergheim.|$|E
5|$|Medications may be {{prescribed}} to treat sleep problems and depression. Analgesics such as ibuprofen {{can be taken}} for headache, but paracetamol (acetaminophen) is preferred {{to minimize the risk}} of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> Concussed individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other drugs that have not been approved by a doctor as they can impede healing. Activation database-guided EEG biofeedback has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control group.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of poisoning by A. ocreata are initially gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea and vomiting which may lead to dehydration and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid-base disturbances. The initial symptoms resolve {{two to three days}} after ingestion of the fungus. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substances in the blood. Renal failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic renal damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> sepsis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Repeated <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> {{caused by}} cardiac myxoma is very rare. It is {{essential}} for physicians {{to be aware of}} such uncommon clinical feature of myxoma. Case presentation We report a- 49 -year-old female patient complained of repeated multiple <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhages,</b> with no sign of cardiac dysfunction or cerebral infarction before admission. Cavernous angioma (CA) was misdiagnosded due to the clinical and magnetic resonance (MR) presentation. A sudden ischemic event after admission led to the finding of a left atrial myxoma. Conclusions Repeated <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> can be the early and primary clinical presentation of cardiac myxoma, probably caused by its metastasis, without obvious ischemic stroke or cardiac symptoms...|$|R

25|$|An {{attempt was}} made to find a better method of {{implementing}} warfarin therapy without the inconvenience of regular monitoring and risk of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> A combination of aspirin and fixed-dose warfarin (initial INR 1.2-1.5) was tried. Unfortunately, in a study of AF patients with additional risk factors for thromboembolism, the combination of aspirin and the lower dose of warfarin was significantly inferior to the standard adjusted-dose warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0), yet still had a similar risk of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b>|$|E
40|$|Hemorrhagic stroke {{can occur}} after spine and joint {{surgeries}} such as laminectomy, lumbar spinal fusion, tumor resection, and total joint arthroplasty. Although {{this kind of}} stroke rarely happens, it may cause severe consequences and high mortality rates. Typical clinical symptoms of hemorrhagic stroke after spine and joint surgeries include headache, vomiting, consciousness disturbance, and mental disorders. It can happen several hours after surgeries. Most bleeding sites are located in cerebellar hemisphere and temporal lobe. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage caused by surgeries {{may be the key}} to <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> happening. Early diagnosis and treatments are very important for patients to prevent the further progression of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhages.</b> Several patients need a hematoma evacuation and their prognosis is not optimistic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{etiology}} and diagnosis of multiple <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> (ICHs) following severe burns, with a retrospective review of 16 cases of severe burns further complicated by multiple ICHs. Using cranial CT scans of the brains, we identified that all patients presented with low platelet counts and coagulation abnormali-ties prior to <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhaging.</b> Following conventional treatment and various supporting treatments, five cases succumbed following a progressive reduction in blood platelet levels and the ICHs were cured in 11 cases following the resto-ration of normal platelet levels. We conclude that low platelet counts and coagulation abnormalities may cause multiple ICHs following severe burns and early diagnosis and treatment is the key to successful treatment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Few {{studies have}} focused on {{cerebral}} complications among newborn infants delivered by vacuum extraction (VE). The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the risk for intracranial haemorrhage and/or cerebral dysfunction in newborn infants delivered by VE and to compare this risk with that after cesarean section in labour (CS) and spontaneous vaginal delivery, respectively. Methods: Data was obtained from Swedish national registers. In a population-based cohort from 1999 to 2010 including all singleton newborn infants delivered at term after onset of labour by VE (n = 87, 150), CS (75, 216) or spontaneous vaginal delivery (n = 851, 347), we compared the odds for neonatal intracranial haemorrhage, traumatic or non-traumatic, convulsions or encephalopathy. Logistic regressions were used to calculate adjusted (for major risk factors and indication) odds ratios (AOR), using spontaneous vaginal delivery as reference group. Results: The rates of traumatic and non-traumatic <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> were 0. 8 / 10, 000 and 3. 8 / 1, 000. VE deliveries provided 58 % and 31. 5 % of the traumatic and non-traumatic cases, giving a ten-fold risk [AOR 10. 05 (4. 67 - 21. 65) ] and double risk [AOR 2. 23 (1. 57 - 3. 16) ], respectively. High birth weight and short mother were associated with the highest risks. Infants delivered by CS had no increased risk for <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhages.</b> The risks for convulsions or encephalopathy were similar among infants delivered by VE and CS, exceeding the OR after non-assisted spontaneous vaginal delivery by two-to-three times. Conclusion: Vacuum assisted delivery is associated with increased risk for neonatal <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhages.</b> Although causality could not be established in this observational study, it is important to be aware of the increased risk of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> in VE deliveries, particularly in short women and large infants. The results warrant further studies in decision making and conduct of assisted vaginal delivery...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Head CT is {{the current}} neuroimaging tool of choice in acute {{evaluation}} of pediatric head trauma. The potential cancer risks of CT-related ionizing radiation should limit its use in children. We evaluated the role of MR imaging, including a "black bone" sequence, compared with CT in detecting skull fractures and <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> in children with acute head trauma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective evaluation of 2 D head CT and brain MR imaging studies including the black bone sequence of children with head trauma. Two experienced pediatric neuroradiologists in consensus created the standard of reference. Another pediatric neuroradiologist blinded to the diagnosis evaluated brain MR images and head CT images in 2 separate sessions. The presence of skull fractures and <b>intracranial</b> posttraumatic <b>hemorrhages</b> was evaluated. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of CT and MR imaging with the black bone sequence in the diagnosis of skull fractures and <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhages.</b> RESULTS: Twenty-eight children (24 boys; mean age, 4. 89 years; range, 0 - 15. 5 years) with head trauma were included. MR imaging with the black bone sequence revealed lower sensitivity (66. 7...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Spinal {{anesthesia}} is {{a widely}} used general purpose anesthesia. However, serious complications, such as <b>intracranial</b> subdural <b>hemorrhage,</b> can rarely occur. Case presentation We report {{the case of a}} 73 -year-old Japanese woman who had acute onset of <b>intracranial</b> subdural <b>hemorrhage</b> five days after spinal anesthesia for knee arthroscopic surgery. Conclusion This case highlights the need to pay attention to acute <b>intracranial</b> subdural <b>hemorrhage</b> as a complication after spinal anesthesia. If the headache persists even in a supine position or nausea occurs abruptly, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain should be conducted. An intracranial subdural hematoma may have a serious outcome and is an important differential diagnosis for headache after spinal anesthesia. </p...|$|R

25|$|Although {{patients}} {{at high risk}} of bleeding were excluded from the phase III clinical study (PROWESS), 25% of patients treated with drotrecogin and 18% of those receiving placebo experienced at least one bleeding event (principally ecchymoses or GI bleeding) during the 28-day study period. During treatment serious bleeding events (e.g., <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> any life-threatening bleeding event, any bleeding event requiring administration of at least 3 units of packed red blood cells daily for 2 consecutive days) occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with drotrecogin and in 1% of those receiving placebo. No significant differences between geriatric patients and younger patients regarding bleeding events in the drotrecogin group have been found.|$|E
25|$|The glymphatic {{system may}} also be {{impaired}} after acute brain injuries such as ischemic stroke, <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> or subarachnoid hemorrhage. In 2014, a group of researchers from the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) demonstrated by MRI that the glymphatic system was impaired after subarachnoid hemorrhage, {{because of the presence}} of coagulated blood in the paravascular spaces. Interestingly, injection of tissue plasminogen activator (a fibrinolytic drug) in the CSF improved glymphatic functioning. In a parallel study, they also demonstrated that the glymphatic system was impaired after ischemic stroke in the ischemic hemisphere, although the pathophysiological basis of this phenomenon remains unclear. Notably, recanalization of the occluded artery also reestablished the glymphatic flow.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{headaches}} {{are classified}} {{based on their}} cause and not on their symptoms. According to the ICHD-2 classification, the main types of secondary headaches include those that are due to head or neck trauma such as whiplash injury, intracranial hematoma, post craniotomy or other head or neck injury. Headaches caused by cranial or cervical vascular disorders such as ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, non-traumatic <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> vascular malformations or arteritis are also defined as secondary headaches. This type of headaches may also be caused by cerebral venous thrombosis or different intracranial vascular disorders. Other secondary headaches are those due to intracranial disorders that are not vascular such as low or high pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, non-infectious inflammatory disease, intracranial neoplasm, epileptic seizure or other types of disorders or diseases that are intracranial but that are not associated with the vasculature of the central nervous system. ICHD-2 classifies headaches that are caused by the ingestion of a certain substance or by its withdrawal as secondary headaches as well. This type of headache may result from the overuse of some medications or by exposure to some substances. HIV/AIDS, intracranial infections and systemic infections may also cause secondary headaches. The ICHD-2 system of classification includes the headaches associated with homeostasis disorders {{in the category of}} secondary headaches. This means that headaches caused by dialysis, high blood pressure, hypothyroidism, and cephalalgia and even fasting are considered secondary headaches. Secondary headaches, according to the same classification system, can also be due to the injury of any of the facial structures including teeth, jaws, or temporomandibular joint. Headaches caused by psychiatric disorders such as somatization or psychotic disorders are also classified as secondary headaches.|$|E
