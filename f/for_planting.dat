5|$|Bowman then {{appealed the}} {{decision}} to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Bowman argued that the Monsanto license agreement allowed the sale of second-generation soybeans to both grain elevators and subsequent buyers and that this caused the patent rights to be exhausted per the United States Supreme Court's ruling in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc. Monsanto argued that the license agreement specifically prohibited the use of second-generation seeds <b>for</b> <b>planting.</b> The Federal Circuit upheld the lower court's decision in favor of Monsanto.|$|E
5|$|I'itoi {{onion is}} a {{prolific}} multiplier onion cultivated in the Baboquivari Peak Wilderness, Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and {{is easy to}} grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1in below the surface and 12in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back {{in the heat of}} summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place <b>for</b> <b>planting</b> in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of a three-field rotation system <b>for</b> <b>planting</b> crops increased the usage of land from one half in use each year under the old two-field system to two-thirds under the new system, with a consequent increase in production. The {{development of}} the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently, aided by {{the spread of the}} horse collar, which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen. Horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture, factors that aided the implementation of the three-field system.|$|E

5|$|The {{sycamore}} {{is noted}} for its tolerance of wind, urban pollution, salt spray, and low summer temperatures, {{which makes it a}} popular tree <b>for</b> <b>planting</b> in cities, along roads treated with salt in winter, and in coastal localities. It is cultivated and widely naturalised north of its native range in Northern Europe, notably in the British Isles and Scandinavia north to Tromsø, Norway (seeds can ripen as far north as Vesterålen); Reykjavík, Iceland; and Tórshavn on the Faroe Islands. It now occurs throughout the British Isles, having been introduced in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Europeans began {{settling}} the river valleys around the Metacomet Ridge in the mid–17th century. Forests were cut down or burned {{to make room}} for agriculture, resulting in the near complete denuding of the once contiguous forests of southern New England by the 19th century. Steep terrain like the Metacomet Ridge, while not suitable <b>for</b> <b>planting</b> crops, was widely harvested of timber {{as a result of the}} expanding charcoal industry that boomed before the mining of coal from the mid–Appalachian regions replaced it as a source of fuel. In other cases, ridgetop forests burned when lower elevation land was set afire, and some uplands were used for pasturing. Traprock was harvested from talus slopes of the Metacomet Ridge to build house foundations; copper ore was discovered at the base of Peak Mountain in northern Connecticut and was mined by prisoners incarcerated at Old Newgate Prison located there.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean crop {{seeds from}} a local grain {{elevator}} for his second crop of the season. He then saved seeds from his second crop to replant additional crops in later years. Bowman purchased these soybean seeds from the same elevator to which he and neighbors sold their soybean crops, {{many of which were}} transgenic, and the elevator sold these soybeans as commodities, not as seeds <b>for</b> <b>planting.</b> He tested the new seeds, and found that, as he had expected, some were transgenic and thus were resistant to glyphosate. He replanted seeds from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting, supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator. He informed Monsanto of his activities.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} sport, {{the use of}} poles for {{vaulting}} distances was recorded in Fierljeppen contests in the Frisian area of Europe, and vaulting for height was seen at gymnastics competitions in Germany in the 1770s. One of the earliest recorded pole vault competitions was in Cumbria, England in 1843. The basic rules and technique of the event originated in the United States. The rules required that athletes do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the bar with their feet first and twisting so that the stomach faces the bar. Bamboo poles were introduced in the 20th century and a metal box in the runway <b>for</b> <b>planting</b> the pole became standard. Landing mattresses were introduced in the mid-20th century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that the spread of Armillaria root rot in {{eucalypt}} forests is associated with infected stumps that remain after an area has been logged. Armillaria luteobubalina can persist on these stumps, using them as a source of food for up to 25 or more years. In one case reported in Ovens, Victoria, the disease was spread to blueberry plants (Vaccinium species) via buried fragments of infected Eucalyptus that remained following preparation of the previously forested site <b>for</b> <b>planting.</b> In individual forest stands, fungal infection is usually found in discrete disease patches separated by stands of healthy trees—a discontinuous distribution. Large-scale aerial photography can be used to identify regions of forest infected by the species. The species also causes damage to trees and bushes in coastal dune woodlands, shrubland, and heath communities. It can be found on a wide range of hosts, but is most commonly associated with (in order of decreasing frequency) jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), bull banksia (Banksia grandis), marri (E.calophylla), Lasiopetalum floribundum, and Acacia saligna. It has also infected scattered populations of wandoo (E. wandoo). The fungus has also been reported to infect Nothofagus species in Argentina, and Pinus radiata in Chile.|$|E
