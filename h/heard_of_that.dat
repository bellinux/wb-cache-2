West of that place, {{following}} the general course of Moorsom's design, he considerably improved the curves and gradients. From Probus the line would now run to the northern margin of Truro and then south to Falmouth. This avoided the crossing of the Truro River and the objectionable crossing at Penryn.

500|$|The band became {{associated}} with the International Space Year (ISY), designated as 1992 by the United Nations to promote peaceful and collaborative space exploration, when Linnell and Flansburgh were searching the NASA Archive Center for appropriate photographs and visual materials for the album artwork. Staff members at the NASA facility took notice of the duo and inquired about their research. Linnell responded that they [...] "were in this band, we're making this record, and we're going to start touring next year...They were particularly interested in that, because they said that 1992 was ISY. It {{was the first time}} we ever <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> but they said because we were a band going to be touring around the world in 1992 they wondered if we wanted to be spokesband for the ISY. So we said why not?" ...|$|E
500|$|The 2008 American {{young adult}} novel The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins {{has been accused}} of being strikingly similar to Battle Royale in terms of the basic plot premise. While Collins {{maintains}} that she [...] "had never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> book until her book was turned in", Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that [...] "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff," [...] but argued that [...] "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently." [...] The general consensus in the time since has been one of amicable controversy, especially since the release of The Hunger Games film adaptation. Battle Royale author Takami said he appreciated fans [...] "standing up" [...] for his book, but stated that he thinks [...] "every novel has something to offer," [...] and that if [...] "readers find value in either book, that's all an author can ask for." ...|$|E

500|$|After Louisbourg, {{the company}} was {{stationed}} first at Fort Frederick (Saint John, New Brunswick), and then at Fort St. Anne, where {{the company was}} part of a campaign against Indians and Acadians that had taken refuge there from the ongoing expulsion of the Acadians. [...] These raids were sometimes quite brutal; the company was known to scalp Acadian settlers. [...] In one particularly brutal incident, Hazen was responsible for the scalping of six men, and the burning of four others, along with two women and three children, in a house he set on fire. [...] Joseph Bellefontaine, a leader of the local militia and the father of one of the women, claimed that he was forced to witness this event in an attempt to coerce his cooperation with the rangers. [...] (Bellefontaine escaped into the woods with two of his grandchildren.) [...] General Jeffrey Amherst, who did not hear of the incident until after he had promoted Hazen to captain, noted, [...] "I am sorry that to say what I have since <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> affair has sullied his merit with me as I shall always disapprove of killing women and helpless children." ...|$|E
500|$|Similarities of The Hunger Games to Koushun Takami's 1999novel Battle Royale {{have been}} noted. Collins stated that she [...] "had never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> book or that author until my book was turned in. At that point, it was {{mentioned}} to me, and I asked my editor if I should read it. He said: 'No, I don't want that world in your head. Just continue with what you're doing'." [...] Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that [...] "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's {{work has been}} savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff" [...] of Battle Royale but argued that [...] "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently." [...] Stephen King noted that the reality TV [...] "badlands" [...] were similar to Battle Royale, {{as well as his}} own novels The Running Man and The Long Walk. Eric Eisenberg wrote that The Hunger Games was [...] "not a rip off of Battle Royale, but simply a different usage of a similar idea", pointing out various differences in both story and themes.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1997, she {{received}} a letter from the Christian Community Centre in Ireland suggesting she run for the Irish presidency. Having no interest in politics at the time, and never having <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> organisation, she threw the [...] "incredible" [...] proposal in the bin. But they persisted and similar mail arrived from other people. Then the media got involved. She eventually agreed to seek nomination as a candidate in the 1997 Irish presidential election, standing as an independent under the name Dana Rosemary Scallon. Her campaign was based on the Irish Constitution and her belief that it could only be amended with the agreement of the Irish people by public ballot. She later became the first-ever presidential candidate to secure a nomination solely from County and City Councils, rather than from members of the Oireachtas. Polling day was 31 October, and Scallon received 175,458 of the first-preference votes (13.8%), coming third to Fianna FÃ¡il's candidate and eventual winner Mary McAleese. Before returning to America she told reporters: [...] "I may not be a president, but I am a precedent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Iowa Republican congressman Steve King {{supported}} Akin {{during the}} controversy, saying that Akin [...] "is a strong Christian man, {{with a wonderful}} family". King answered a question about Medicaid's coverage for abortions for victims of rape and incest, saying [...] "I just haven't <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> being a circumstance that's been brought to me in any personal way, and I'd be open to discussion about that subject matter." [...] King's comments were condemned by multiple sources, and others drew attention to their similarity to Akin's remarks. Controversy over Akin's comments ignited again after the election, when fellow Republican Representative Phil Gingrey, who is also an obstetrician, said Akin's comments were [...] "partly right" [...] when he said women's bodies can avoid pregnancy in cases of rape. Gingrey {{also said that he}} [...] "delivered lots of babies" [...] and [...] " [...] about these things". Gingrey also said he found nothing wrong with distinguishing [...] "legitimate rape" [...] from non-legitimate rape, which he defined as a false accusation. His office released a statement that said, [...] "In my attempt to provide context as to what I presumed they meant, my position was misconstrued." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 1966, Paisley and his {{associate}} Noel Doherty {{founded the}} Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC) and its paramilitary wing, the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV). At the time, Irish republicans were marking the 50th {{anniversary of the}} Easter Rising. Although the IRA was inactive, loyalists such as Paisley warned that {{it was about to}} be revived and launch another campaign against Northern Ireland. At the same time, a loyalist paramilitary group calling itself the [...] "Ulster Volunteer Force" [...] (UVF) emerged in the Shankill area of Belfast, led by Gusty Spence. Many of its members were also members of the UCDC and UPV, including UCDC secretary and UPV leader Noel Doherty. Paisley publicly thanked the UVF for taking part in a march on 7 April. In May and June, the UVF petrol bombed a number of Catholic homes, schools and businesses. It also shot dead two Catholic civilians as they walked home. These are sometimes seen as the first deaths of the Troubles. Following the killings, the UVF was outlawed and Paisley denied any knowledge of its activities. [...] One of those convicted for the killings said after his arrest [...] "I am terribly sorry I ever <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> man Paisley or decided to follow him".|$|E
2500|$|Johnston {{began to}} move his force west to join Pemberton when he <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> general's defeat at Champion Hill (May 16) and Big Black River Bridge (May 17). The {{survivors}} retreated to the fortifications of Vicksburg. Johnston urged Pemberton to avoid being surrounded by abandoning the city and to join forces with Johnston's troops, outnumbering Grant, but Davis had ordered Pemberton to defend the city as his highest priority. Grant launched two unsuccessful assaults against the fortifications and then settled in for a siege. The soldiers and civilians in the surrounded city waited in vain for Johnston's small force {{to come to their}} rescue. By late May Johnston had accumulated about 24,000 men but wanted additional reinforcements before moving forward. He considered ordering Bragg to send these reinforcements, but was concerned that this could result in the loss of Tennessee. He also bickered with President Davis about whether the order sending him to Mississippi could be construed as removing him from theater command; historian Steven E. Woodworth judges that Johnston [...] "willfully misconstrued" [...] his orders out of resentment of Davis's interference. Pemberton's army surrendered on July 4, 1863. Along with the capture of Port Hudson a week later, the loss of Vicksburg gave the Union complete control of the Mississippi River and cut the Confederacy in two. President Davis wryly ascribed the strategic defeat to a [...] "want of provisions inside and a general outside [...] who would not fight." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sanchez {{has several}} times stated he is envious of his father's era of music, {{and that the}} band is {{influenced}} by groups of that era, such as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Police, Misfits, Queen, and Thin Lizzy. Apart from these roots, Sanchez also acknowledges an eclectic array of influences, including post-hardcore group At the Drive-In, and heavy metal pioneers Iron Maiden. Contrary to rumors, bassist Michael Todd said the band was not influenced by Saga {{and that he had}} never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> group. Many draw similarities between Rush and Coheed and Cambria, but Josh Eppard stated in an interview that neither he nor the other band members were Rush fans or influenced by Rush. They began listening to Rush after their second album. Influences of punk rock have been cited as well, especially the Misfits and Bad Brains. Dr. Know of Bad Brains plays a guitar solo on the track [...] "Time Consumer" [...] from Second Stage Turbine Blade. Sanchez and Stever's early band Toxic Parents drew many similarities from Jane's Addiction and Misfits. Sanchez has stated that The Amory Wars, the story on which Coheed and Cambria base its lyrics, has similarities to other stories, especially to the Star Wars trilogy. For example, when the character Coheed returns home to his wife Cambria, she says, [...] "Somehow Iâve always known," [...] a line that Princess Leia said to Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi.|$|E

2500|$|Renowned {{throughout}} his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long {{before the advent of}} telemetry, this characteristic [...] led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the US Grand Prix in Dallas as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of the more popular Monaco, where Senna and Toleman scored their first podium finish. This is by reference to the following recollection given by Symonds in an interview in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death:The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said [...] "I'm sure that the wall moved!" [...] and even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him, after the race, {{to have a look at}} the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened â we could see it from the tyre marks â was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.|$|E
