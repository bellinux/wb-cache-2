At Survivor Series in November, Orton defeated Michaels in a match to retain his WWE Championship. That same month, on the November 16 edition of SmackDown!, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Matt Hardy lost the WWE Tag Team Championship in a match against John Morrison and The Miz.|$|E
5|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld {{continued}} the plot line established in Legend. Crystal Dynamics used {{new technology to}} improve the character for seventh generation consoles, focusing on improving realism. The dirt accumulation and water cleansing mechanic from Legend was altered to be a real-time mechanic that can involve the entire game environment. To achieve a more natural appearance, the developers added spherical harmonics to provide indirect lighting to in-game objects like Lara Croft. Crystal Dynamics made the character model more complex and detailed than previous instalments, featuring more texture layers that determine the appearance of shadows and reflective light on it, and using skeletal animation to portray believable movement. The number of polygons in the model increased to 32,000. The developers enhanced Croft's facial model by {{increasing the number of}} polygons, bones used in the animation skeleton, and graphical shaders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> add more detail and expressive capabilities. The hair was created as a real-time cloth simulation to further add realism to its shape and movement. The developers kept Croft's hair tied back because they felt a real person would not want it flying around while performing dangerous manoeuvres. The character's body size was increased and breast size reduced to portray more realistic proportions.|$|E

Rush specifically called the suit [...] "frivolous" [...] and [...] "impetuous", openly questioning whether the ACLU had filed the suit to enhance fundraising activities or for other political reasons.|$|E

500|$|The {{perceived}} lack {{of respect}} shown to one of England's leading artists led to some outcry, and attacks in the press upon the then very unpopular Albert; William Makepeace Thackeray wrote in 1845: [...] "Think of the greatest patronage in the world giving forty pounds for pictures worth four hundredâ€”condescending to buy works from humble men who could not refuse, and paying for them below their value! Think of august powers and principalities ordering the works of such a great artist as Etty to be hacked out of the palace-wall! That was a slap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> every artist in England." ...|$|E
500|$|Georgia Tech {{students}} hold a heated, {{long and}} ongoing rivalry with the University of Georgia, known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. The first known hostilities {{between the two}} institutions trace back to 1891. The University of Georgia's literary magazine proclaimed UGA's colors to be [...] "old gold, black, and crimson". Dr. Charles H. Herty, then President of the University of Georgia, felt that old gold was too similar to yellow and that it [...] "symbolized cowardice". After the 1893 football game against Tech, Herty removed old gold as an official color. Tech would first use old gold for their uniforms, as a proverbial slap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> UGA, in their first unofficial football game against Auburn in 1891. Georgia Tech's school colors would henceforth be old gold and white.|$|E
500|$|Fraser and Navarro {{write that}} {{toward the end}} of her life, Evita was working as many as 20 to 22 hours per day in her foundation, often {{ignoring}} her husband's request that she cut back on her workload and take the weekends off. The more she worked with the poor in her foundation, the more she adopted an outraged attitude toward the existence of poverty, saying, [...] "Sometimes I have wished my insults were slaps or lashes. I've wanted to hit people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> make them see, if only for a day, what I see each day I help the people." [...] Crassweller writes that Evita became fanatical about her work in the foundation and felt on a crusade against the very concept and existence of poverty and social ills. [...] "It is not surprising", writes Crassweller, [...] "that as her public crusades and her private adorations took on a narrowing intensity after 1946, they simultaneously veered toward the transcendental." [...] Crassweller compares Evita to Ignatius Loyola, saying she came to be akin to a one-woman Jesuit Order.|$|E

500|$|Although most of Waugh's books {{had sold}} well, {{and he had}} been well-rewarded for his journalism, his levels of {{expenditure}} meant that money problems and tax bills were a recurrent feature in his life. In 1950, as a means of tax avoidance, he had set up a trust fund for his children (he termed it the [...] "Save the Children Fund", after the well-established charity of that name) into which he placed the initial advance and all future royalties from the Penguin (paperback) editions of his books. He was able to augment his personal finances by charging household items to the trust or selling his own possessions to it. Nonetheless, by 1960, shortage of money led him to agree to an interview on BBC Television, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Face</b> <b>to</b> Face series conducted by John Freeman. The interview was broadcast on 26 June 1960; according to his biographer Selena Hastings, Waugh restrained his instinctive hostility and coolly answered the questions put to him by Freeman, assuming what she describes as a [...] "pose of world-weary boredom".|$|E
500|$|Before its {{standalone}} {{version was}} announced in June 2017, many criticized the decision that Modern Warfare Remastered would only be available through purchasing a premium version of Infinite Warfare, with Activision being accused of anti-consumerism practices and coercing fans into paying more than necessary. Joey Thurmond disagreed with how a re-release of a classic that had shaped both the series' formula and first-person shooter genre in general had been coupled with a new, poorly-received title, calling the choice [...] "preposterous" [...] and [...] "a bullet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> consumers". He argued that selling Remastered separately would actually benefit Activision, forecasting an eventual influx of pre-owned copies of the bundle being sold, devaluing Infinite Warfares worth in the process. Forbes Paul Tassi described the bundling as being [...] "a way to essentially blackmail players into picking up a more expensive version of a base game {{they may not have}} even wanted (Infinite Warfare) in order to get something they desperately wanted (Modern Warfare Remastered)", but understood why Activision had made the choice due to it being [...] "pro-money".|$|E
500|$|In early 2015, Nintendo {{launched}} its Creator Program, {{in order to}} share revenue with YouTube video creators who feature gameplay of their products in videos. PewDiePie joined various gamers in criticising the programme. PewDiePie called the program a [...] "slap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> the YouTube channels that [...] focus on Nintendo game exclusively", adding, [...] "The people who have helped and showed passion for Nintendo's community are the ones left in the dirt the most." [...] Despite criticisms from PewDiePie and other gamers alike, Nintendo experienced more requests from YouTube creators than expected, causing an extension on the 72-hour wait time for video approval through the program. Additionally, PewDiePie, stated, [...] "I'll still play Nintendo games that I want to play on my channel as usual. I'm lucky {{to be in a}} situation where losing ad revenue on a few videos won't matter. However, many people on YouTube are not in that situation." [...] Ultimately, the focal point of criticism is toward the approval of a video which Nintendo has to administer, and may be motivated by biased intentions.|$|E

500|$|Before long, {{all three}} of her daughters became active with the WSPU. Christabel was arrested after {{spitting}} at a policeman during {{a meeting of the}} Liberal Party in October 1905; Adela and Sylvia were arrested a year later during a protest outside Parliament. Pankhurst was arrested {{for the first time in}} February 1908, when she tried to enter Parliament to deliver a protest resolution to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. She was charged with obstruction and sentenced to six weeks in prison. She spoke out against the conditions of her confinement, including vermin, meagre food, and the [...] "civilised torture of solitary confinement and absolute silence" [...] to which she and others were ordered. Pankhurst saw imprisonment as a means to publicise the urgency of women's suffrage; in June 1909 she struck a police officer twice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> ensure she would be arrested. Pankhurst was arrested seven times before women's suffrage was approved.

500|$|Before the season, Baseball America ranked Ishikawa {{the number}} four {{prospect}} in the Giants' organization. He attended spring training with the Giants {{for the first}} time in his career. He was recalled from the minors {{for the first time}} on April 18 when Lance Niekro was placed on the Bereavement List, and made his major league debut the same day in a 74 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. His first big league hit came on April 19 as a pinch-hit single off Brandon Webb in a 103 loss to Arizona. The next day, he returned to the minors to make room for Niekro. On May 26, he was recalled when Daniel Ortmeier was sent to the minors. He had his first big league start that day against the Colorado Rockies and had three hits, two doubles and three RBI in a 90 victory. After the game, Kevin Frandsen and Todd Greene gave him a pie <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> celebrate. After four games (during which he hit [...]500), he was returned to the minors on May 30. He was recalled on June 13 when Niekro went on the disabled list again. After six games on this stint, he returned to the minors on June 21 when Frandsen was recalled. In the minor leagues that year, Ishikawa played for the Double-A Connecticut Defenders of the Eastern League.

500|$|The {{bombing was}} {{condemned}} by British Prime Minister John Major and his government, by the opposition, and by {{individual members of}} parliament (MPs) as a [...] "sickening", [...] "callous" [...] and [...] "barbaric" [...] terrorist attack. Early on, Major stated that, [...] "This explosion looks like {{the work of the}} IRA. It is the work of a few fanatics and... causes absolute revulsion in Ireland as it does here". Sinn FÃ©in was criticised by Taoiseach John Bruton for being [...] "struck mute" [...] on the attack in the immediate aftermath. Bruton described the bombing as [...] "a slap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> people who've been trying, against perhaps their better instincts, to give Sinn FÃ©in a chance to show that they could persuade the IRA to reinstate the ceasefire". [...] The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, stated he was [...] "deeply outraged by the bomb explosion" [...] and joined Bruton and Major in [...] "utterly condemning this brutal and cowardly act of terrorism". Sinn FÃ©in President, Gerry Adams, stated that he was [...] "shocked and saddened" [...] by the bombing. He insisted that his party was committed to achieving a peace settlement and argued [...] "it is sheer folly to return to the old agenda of excluding Sinn FÃ©in and seeking to isolate republicans". On 20 June 1996, the IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing, and stated that it [...] "sincerely regretted" [...] causing injury to civilians. The IRA statement continued:The British Government has spent the last 22 months since August '94 trying to force the surrender of IRA weapons and the defeat of the republican struggle. We are still prepared to enhance the democratic peace process [...] but {{if there is to be}} a lasting peace [...] then the British Government must put the democratic rights of all of the people of Ireland before its own party political self interest.|$|E
