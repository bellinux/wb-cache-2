25|$|MPS II, <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome</b> or iduronate sulfatase deficiency, {{is caused}} by lack of the enzyme iduronate sulfatase. <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome</b> has two {{clinical}} subtypes and (since it shows X-linked recessive inheritance) {{is the only one}} of the mucopolysaccharidoses in which the mother alone can pass the defective gene to a son.

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 1 in 25,000 babies born in the United States will {{have some form of}} the mucopolysaccharidoses.

When both people in a couple have the defective gene, each pregnancy carries with it a one in four chance that the child will be affected. The parents and siblings of an affected child may have no sign of the disorder. Unaffected siblings and select relatives of a child with one of the mucopolysaccharidoses may carry the recessive gene and could pass it to their own children.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{experiences}} of Korean mothers in parenting children with Hunter's syn-drome, an X linked recessive genetically inherited disease usually affecting boys. Methods: Data were collected from 14 moth-ers having children with <b>Hunter's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> through two focus group interviews and individual in-depth interviews. Qualitative data from the field notes and transcribed notes were analyzed using the grounded theory methodology developed by Strauss & Corbin (1998). Results: The core category about the process of rearing children with <b>Hunter's</b> <b>syndrome</b> was identified as “navigating in the maze”. The process of rearing children with <b>Hunter's</b> <b>syndrome</b> passed through three phases; ‘entering an unknown region’, ‘struggling to escape from the unknown region’, ‘settling down in the unknown region’. Conclusion: In this study “navigating in the maze”, as the core category deeply showed joys and sorrows of mothers in the process of rearing their children with <b>Hunter's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> In this rearing process they gradually adjusted themselves to their given condition. Also they gained initiatively coping strategies to care for, and protect their children. Therefore health care providers can establis...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (<b>Hunter's</b> <b>syndrome)</b> is an X-linked {{chromosomal}} storage disorder due to {{deficiency of}} the lysosomal enzyme iduronate- 2 -sulfatase with patients rarely living till adulthood. Failure to identify patients early {{could contribute to}} an increased morbidity as identified in this case report. CASE DETAILS: An eight year old patient with <b>Hunter's</b> <b>syndrome</b> identified five years after disease onset with severe cardiovascular complications exemplifies the challenges faced in resource-limited countries towards making {{diagnosis and treatment of}} rare conditions. Elevated urinary glycosaminoglycans levels or a strong clinical suspicion of <b>Hunter's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> as identified in the index case, is a prerequisite for enzyme activity testing. Urinary mucopolysaccharide(MPS) level was 69. 6 mg/mmol(normal range is 0. 0 - 11. 6 mg/mmol), and the confirming MPS electrophoresis analysis showed elevated heparan sulphate in the urine sample. Enzyme activity testing, with absent or very low iduronate- 2 -sulfatase activity, is diagnostic. However, the scarce availability and high cost of these tests is another constraint in making a diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Identification and management of mucopolysaccharidosis type II pose a problem in resource-constrained countries due to late presentation, lack of facility for diagnosis and treatment, cost and expertise required for the management...|$|R
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome</b> (MPS II) {{are generally not}} apparent at birth, but usually start to become noticeable {{after the first year}} of life.

As the buildup of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) continues throughout the cells of the body, signs of <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome</b> become more visible. Physical appearances of many children with <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome</b> include a distinctive coarseness in their facial features, including a prominent forehead, a nose with a flattened bridge, and an enlarged tongue. For this reason, unrelated children with <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome</b> often look alike. They may also have a large head as well as an enlarged abdomen.

5000|$|The {{continued}} {{storage of}} GAG in cells {{can lead to}} organs being affected in important ways. The thickening of the heart valves along with {{the walls of the}} heart can result in progressive decline in cardiac function. The walls of the airway may become thickened as well, leading to breathing problems while sleeping (obstructive airway disease) and noisy breathing generally. People with <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome</b> may also have limited lung capacity due to pulmonary involvement. As the liver and spleen grow larger with time, the belly may become distended, making hernias more noticeable. All major joints (including the wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, and knees) may be affected by <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome,</b> leading to joint stiffness and limited motion. Progressive involvement of the finger and thumb joints results in decreased ability to pick up small objects. The effects on other joints, such as hips and knees, can make it increasingly difficult to walk normally. If carpal tunnel syndrome develops, a common symptom even in young children with <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome,</b> a further decrease in hand function can occur. The bones themselves may be affected, resulting in short stature. In addition, pebbly, ivory-colored skin lesions may be found on the upper arms, legs and upper back of some people with <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The presence or absence of the skin lesions is not helpful, however, in predicting clinical severity in <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Finally, the storage of GAG in the brain can lead to delayed development with subsequent mental retardation and progressive loss of function. The rate and degree of progression is different for each person with <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Although <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome</b> is associated with a broad spectrum of clinical severity, two main forms can be recognized - severe and mild/attenuated. The differences between the severe and attenuated forms are due mainly to the progressive development of neurodegeneration in the severe form. It is important to note, however, that though the terms [...] "attenuated" [...] or [...] "mild" [...] are used by physicians in comparing people with <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome,</b> the effects of even mild disease are quite serious. Between the two main forms of disease, and even within them, two of the most significant areas of variability concern the degree of mental retardation and expected lifespan. Some people who have <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome</b> experience no mental handicaps and live into their 20s or 30s; there are occasional reports of people who have lived into their 50s or 60s. Since the implementation of enzyme replacement therapy for <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome,</b> lifespans for those without mental handicaps are expected to lengthen since their physical disease appears to improve or stabilize with such treatment.

50|$|The visible {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome</b> (MPS II) in younger people are usually the first clues leading to a diagnosis. In general, the time of diagnosis usually occurs about 2 to 4 years of age. Doctors may use laboratory tests to provide additional evidence that an MPS disorder is present, before making a definitive diagnosis, by measuring the iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S) enzyme activity. The most commonly used laboratory screening test for an MPS disorder is a urine test for GAGs. It {{is important to note that}} the urine test for GAGs can occasionally be normal and yet the child still may have an MPS disorder. A definitive diagnosis of <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome</b> is made by measuring I2S activity in serum, white blood cells, or fibroblasts from skin biopsy.

50|$|The {{biochemistry}} of <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is related}} to a problem {{in a part of}} the connective tissue of the body known as the extracellular matrix. This matrix is made up of a variety of sugars and proteins and helps to form the architectural framework of the body. The matrix surrounds the cells of the body in an organized meshwork and functions as the glue that holds the cells of the body together. One of the parts of the extracellular matrix is a complex molecule called a proteoglycan. Like many components of the body, proteoglycans need to be broken down and replaced. When the body breaks down proteoglycans, one of the resulting products is mucopolysaccharides, otherwise known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). There are several types of GAG, each found in certain characteristic places in the body. In <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome,</b> the problem concerns the breakdown of two GAGs: dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. The first step in the breakdown of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate requires the lysosomal enzyme I2S. In people with <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome,</b> this enzyme is either partially or completely inactive. As a result, GAG builds up in cells throughout the body, particularly in tissues that contain large amounts of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. As this buildup continues, it interferes with the way certain cells and organs in the body function and leads to a number of serious symptoms. The rate of GAG buildup is not the same for all people with <b>Hunter</b> <b>syndrome,</b> resulting in a wide spectrum of medical problems.|$|E
