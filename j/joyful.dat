5|$|At the Dutch Grand Prix, Rindt {{eventually}} {{used the}} new Lotus 72, better sorted after alterations had been made. He set pole {{position in the}} final practice session, {{almost a quarter of}} a second ahead of his closest challenger, Stewart. Rindt went on to take his maiden victory in the Lotus 72, {{but it was not a}} <b>joyful</b> occasion for him; on lap 23, his close friend Piers Courage, with whom he had eaten dinner just the night before, died in a fiery crash. Rindt was heavily shaken by the loss of yet another fellow driver and contemplated retirement.|$|E
5|$|The {{second to}} fifth {{scenes of the}} Hachisuka scroll are set in the evening of Kankō 5, 9th month, 15th day (October 16, 1008).

In the second text scene of the emaki, Murasaki Shikibu describes how everybody including servants, minor officials and high nobility was <b>joyful</b> and happy.

5|$|Holmes {{described}} the Christmas setting as a juxtaposition between the <b>joyful</b> {{time of year}} and the grim world of Gotham City, including decorative Santas near Gothic gargoyles and Christmas lights in dark alleys. The city is dislodged from time and space, contrasting 1930s (and older) buildings with Batman's futuristic technology. The New Gotham area was designed for vertical movement, allowing the placement of enemies above and below Batman to create areas dense with activity. The game features high contrast between darks and lights, with exaggerated shadows and few balancing colors. The city was divided into residential, industrial and commercial neighborhoods, which were decorated accordingly: the industrial setting is bleak, the commercial area has corporate decorations and residential neighborhoods have lights in their windows.|$|E

5|$|Rakoto Frah {{performed}} traditional vakindrazana and vazikoava {{pieces for}} sodina, commonly heard {{at a variety}} of holidays and rites observed in the central highlands of Madagascar. The music accompanying the famadihana reburial ceremonies of the central highlands, for instance, is typically performed by an ensemble of sodina players accompanied by the amponga drum. These sodina performances, which express the joy of reuniting with the ancestors, are often competitive. More than one troupe may be present at the famadihana and will take turns showing off their musical skills, with the rapid flight of notes intended to inspire dancing {{over the course of the}} entire day or week of the celebration. The rural artistic tradition of the hira gasy is equally <b>joyful</b> but more elaborate, showcasing the music, dance and oratory skills of a large troupe that includes male and female vocalists, drums, sodina, and a variety of orchestral instruments such as clarinets, trumpets and violins.|$|E
5|$|Talking to a demon has {{different}} effects {{based on its}} personality, responding in a specific way to certain actions. There are four emotional responses that the player can elicit from a demon: anger, fear, joy, and interest. Triggering one of these emotions three times will cause the demon to perform an action: an angry demon will attack the party, a frightened demon will flee the battle, a <b>joyful</b> demon will give the player an item, and an interested demon will either leave the battle, give the player an item, or give the player a special spell card (tarot cards aligned with a particular Persona family or Arcanum). Functions related to the customization of Personas are performed in a special place called the Velvet Room: there, the character Igor can summon new Personas from among the various enemies defeated for a fee. He can also use two spell cards along with a special item {{to create a new}} Persona, which can inherit skills from the Personas used in the fusion. A Persona can only be fused using cards from certain Persona families. Personas can also be deleted if the player so chooses.|$|E
5|$|The Ragamuffin menace {{was halted}} when the {{government}} dispatched field marshal (present-day divisional general) Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (then Baron, later Duke of Caxias) in 1842. The Baron of Caxias had been the second {{in command of the}} Volunteer Soldier-Officers Battalion when it put down the mutiny of navy artillerymen in 1831. He and Joaquim Inácio established a close, lifelong friendship. Joaquim Inácio was promoted to frigate captain on 15 March 1844. Soon afterward, Joaquim Inácio was relieved of command, at his own request, after becoming ever more at odds with his superior. On 2 April 1845, he was assigned command of the frigate Constituição and in October returned to Rio Grande do Sul, which by that time had been pacified. He escorted the Emperor during his tour of the Brazilian southern provinces. PedroII was favorably impressed with the character of the ship's captain.

25|$|Over time, {{these figures}} became more <b>joyful,</b> whimsical, colorful, and larger in scale. Inspired by a {{collaborative}} drawing with American artist Larry Rivers of his wife, her pregnant friend Clarice Price, Saint Phalle began to portray archetypal female figures {{with a more}} optimistic view {{of the position of}} women in society. The newer figures took on ecstatic dance poses and even acrobatic positions, such as handstands and cartwheels. Saint Phalle's light-hearted figures have been compared to the <b>joyful</b> dancers of Matisse and the sturdy female figures by Gaston Lachaise, Aristide Maillol, and Rodin.|$|E

25|$|To Mahayana Buddhists of Sri Lanka and Thailand, {{the seventh}} lunar month is {{a month of}} joy. This is because the fifteenth day of the seventh month is often known as the Buddha's <b>joyful</b> day and the day of rejoicing for monks. The origins of the Buddha's <b>joyful</b> day {{can be found in}} various scriptures. When the Buddha was alive, his disciples meditated in the forests of India during the rainy season of summer. Three months later, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, they would emerge from the forests to {{celebrate}} the completion of their meditation and report their progress to the Buddha. In the Ullambana Sutra, the Buddha instructs his disciple Maudgalyāyana on how to obtain liberation for his mother, who had been reborn into a lower realm, by making food offerings to the sangha on the fifteenth day of the seventh month. Because the number of monks who attained enlightenment during that period was high, the Buddha was very pleased.|$|E
