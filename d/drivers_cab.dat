2500|$|With {{production}} reaching 151 {{there were}} some differences between batches of locos too. Ten of the initial twenty had [...] "Athermos" [...] pressure-lubricated plain bearing axleboxes rather than the more usual roller-bearing axleboxes.

Much more noticeable were D5114–D5132 which were fitted with tablet catchers on the side of the <b>drivers</b> <b>cab</b> for use on the Far North Line from Inverness. Also very visible were the roof-mounted headcode boxes fitted from D5114 giving an outward appearance very similar to the later Class 25 but without horn grilles.|$|E
