5|$|A brewer by trade, Lassell {{began making}} mirrors for his amateur {{telescope}} in 1820. When John Herschel received news of Neptune's discovery, {{he wrote to}} Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell did so and discovered Triton eight days later. Lassell also claimed to have discovered rings. Although Neptune was later confirmed to have rings, they are so <b>faint</b> <b>and</b> dark that {{it is doubtful that}} he actually saw them.|$|E
5|$|Asipatravana/Asipatrakanana (forest of sword leaves): The Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana reserve this {{hell for}} a person who digresses from the {{religious}} teachings of the Vedas and indulges in heresy. The Vishnu Purana states that wanton tree-felling leads to this hell. Yamadutas beat them with whips {{as they try to}} run away in the forest where palm trees have swords as leaves. Afflicted with injury of whips and swords, they <b>faint</b> <b>and</b> cry out for help in vain.|$|E
5|$|Duff was musically {{inspired}} by indie rock band The <b>Faint</b> <b>and</b> pop singers Beyoncé and Gwen Stefani. In {{contrast to the}} pop rock themes of her prior releases, Dignity takes on more of a dance sound, which she said was not her intention while writing the album. The lyrics reference the events Duff experienced in the years leading to the album's release, and the album's songs contain influences {{of rock and roll}} and hip hop music.|$|E

60|$|But the Nightingale's voice grew <b>fainter,</b> <b>and</b> {{her little}} wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes. <b>Fainter</b> <b>and</b> <b>fainter</b> grew her song, {{and she felt}} {{something}} choking her in her throat.|$|R
60|$|But {{the little}} Dwarf never looked up, and his sobs grew <b>fainter</b> <b>and</b> <b>fainter,</b> <b>and</b> {{suddenly}} {{he gave a}} curious gasp, and clutched his side. And then he fell back again, and lay quite still.|$|R
5|$|Eight years later, Norrington is {{promoted}} to Commodore and proposes to Elizabeth, but her corset makes her <b>faint</b> <b>and</b> {{fall into the}} sea and activate the medallion. Captain Jack Sparrow comes to Port Royal to commandeer a ship, and rescues her. Norrington identifies Jack, and a chase ensues. Jack encounters Will, now a blacksmith and swordsman. They duel, and Jack is captured and imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|The smell {{has been}} {{described}} as initially <b>faint</b> <b>and</b> honey-sweet, but strengthening over time to become overpowering, sickly-sweet and objectionable. Young specimens first emerge from the ground resembling a white egg covered by a universal veil, which then breaks, leaving the volva as a remnant. The spore print is white, a common feature of Amanita. The transparent spores are globular to egg-shaped, measure 8–10μm (0.30.4mil) long, and stain blue with iodine. The gills, in contrast, stain pallid lilac or pink with concentrated sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Andromeda Galaxy and its companions, the {{constellation}} also features NGC 891 (Caldwell 23), a smaller galaxy {{just east of}} Almach. It is a barred spiral galaxy seen edge-on, with a dark dust lane visible down the middle. NGC 891 is incredibly <b>faint</b> <b>and</b> small despite its magnitude of 9.9, as its surface brightness of 14.6 indicates; it is 13.5 by 2.8 arcminutes in size. NGC 891 was discovered by the brother-and-sister team of William and Caroline Herschel in August 1783. This galaxy is at an approximate distance of 30 million light-years from Earth, calculated from its redshift of 0.002.|$|E

5|$|Although Aries came to {{represent}} specifically the ram whose fleece became the Golden Fleece of Ancient Greek mythology, it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, {{the stars of}} Aries formed a farmhand. Different cultures have incorporated the stars of Aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in China and a porpoise in the Marshall Islands. Aries is a relatively dim constellation, possessing only four bright stars: Hamal (Alpha Arietis, second magnitude), Sheratan (Beta Arietis, third magnitude), Mesarthim (Gamma Arietis, fourth magnitude), and 41 Arietis (also fourth magnitude). The few deep-sky objects within the constellation are quite <b>faint</b> <b>and</b> include several pairs of interacting galaxies. Several meteor showers appear to radiate from Aries, including the Daytime Arietids and the Epsilon Arietids.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp's orbital {{position}} was calculated as 7.2astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, placing it between Jupiter and Saturn and {{by far the}} greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs. Most comets at this distance are extremely <b>faint,</b> <b>and</b> show no discernible activity, but Hale–Bopp already had an observable coma. An image taken at the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed comet some 13AU from the Sun, a distance at which most comets are essentially unobservable. (Halley's Comet was more than 100 times fainter at the same distance from the Sun.) Analysis indicated later that its comet nucleus was 60±20kilometres in diameter, approximately six {{times the size of}} Halley.|$|E
5|$|The colours {{would have}} first {{appeared}} bright and crisp, but over five-and-a-half centuries the painting has acquired layers of grey dirt which darken {{the tone and}} render the colours <b>faint</b> <b>and</b> pallid. Normally these layers of dirt would be removed by restorers, but given the delicate and fragile nature of a work painted in a water-soluble medium, {{it is impossible to}} do so without removing large amounts of pigment. The colours as they appear today have faded from their original hues. The Virgin's mantle is now brown but would have been painted as blue. Joseph's tabard, once blue, now appears as green. The original indigos of the landscape are lost, while the azurite in Nicodemus's collar has darkened.|$|E

5|$|Noctilucent clouds {{may be seen}} by {{observers}} at a latitude of 50° to 65°. They seldom {{occur at}} lower latitudes (although there have been sightings {{as far south as}} Paris, Utah, Italy, Turkey and Spain), and closer to the poles it does not get dark enough for the clouds to become visible. They occur during summer, from mid-May to mid-August in the northern hemisphere and between mid-November and mid-February in the southern hemisphere. They are very <b>faint</b> <b>and</b> tenuous, and may be observed only in twilight around sunrise and sunset when the clouds of the lower atmosphere are in shadow, but the noctilucent cloud is illuminated by the Sun. They are best seen when the Sun is between 6° and 16° below the horizon. Although noctilucent clouds occur in both hemispheres, they have been observed thousands of times in the northern hemisphere, but fewer than 100 times in the southern. Southern hemisphere noctilucent clouds are fainter and occur less frequently; additionally the southern hemisphere has a lower population and less land area from which to make observations.|$|E

25|$|Hobo spiders have a light stripe {{running down}} the middle of the sternum. If the spider instead has three or four pairs of light spots on the lateral {{portions}} of the sternum, then it is one of the other two related Eratigena species. However absence of spots is not conclusive proof that the spider is a hobo spider, since the spots on other Eratigena species may be extremely <b>faint</b> <b>and</b> not readily visible.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} {{examples}} of systems beyond ternaries: Castor is a sextuple star system, {{which is the}} second-brightest star in the constellation Gemini {{and one of the}} brightest stars in the nighttime sky. Astronomically, Castor was discovered to be a visual binary in 1719. Each of the components of Castor is itself a spectroscopic binary. Castor also has a <b>faint</b> <b>and</b> widely separated companion, which is also a spectroscopic binary. The Alcor–Mizar visual binary in Ursa Majoris also consists of six stars, four comprising Mizar and two comprising Alcor.|$|E
25|$|The {{rings are}} named alphabetically {{in the order}} they were discovered. The main rings are, working outward from the planet, C, B and A, with the Cassini Division, the largest gap, {{separating}} Rings B and A. Several fainter rings were discovered more recently. The D Ring is exceedingly <b>faint</b> <b>and</b> closest to the planet. The narrow F Ring is just outside the A Ring. Beyond that are two far fainter rings named G and E. The rings show {{a tremendous amount of}} structure on all scales, some related to perturbations by Saturn's moons, but much unexplained.|$|E
500|$|Microscopium [...] {{is a minor}} {{constellation}} in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere, one {{of twelve}} created in the 18th century by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille and one of several depicting scientific instruments.
