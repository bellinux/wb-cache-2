In <b>erdosteine</b> group, the administration of <b>erdosteine</b> solution (50 mg/kg) was started two days before aortic cross-clamping and rabbits (n= 8) were subjected to ischemia and reperfusion. Animals in control group (n= 5) underwent a surgical procedure similar to the other groups but the aorta was not clamped. The animals were sacrificed at 72 h and histopathological, and biochemical analyses were carried out on the lumbar spinal cords. Results. <b>Erdosteine</b> treatment was associated with improved neurological function in the postoperative period. Histopathological examination of spinal cord tissues in <b>erdosteine</b> group revealed changes consistent with mild ischemic injury, but rabbits in I/R group with paraplegia had total destruction of the motor neurons.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} whether <b>erdosteine</b> and its metabolites (substances containing thiol groups) can prevent the alteration of the chemotactic function of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) from peripheral blood induced by cigarette smoke of eight healthy non-smoking volunteers, when incubated in vitro before smoke exposure, and whether oral treatment with <b>erdosteine</b> (900 mg/day) for two weeks might restore the chemotaxis of PMN, either from eight healthy or from 16 chronic bronchitic smokers. The chemotactic stimuli in vitro were casein, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenyalanine (FMLP). The results of the study in vitro have confirmed that PMN from non-smoking volunteers shows a reduced chemotactic responsiveness when exposed in vitro to smoke.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of oral <b>erdosteine</b> in treating elderly patients with bronchiectasis and chronic mucus hypersecretion who have been referred to a pulmonary rehabilitation program. METHODS: In this 15 -day, prospective, parallel, open label, pilot study, elderly patients with bronchiectasis, hypersecretion, a noncurrent smoking status, who had been consecutively enrolled at Ospedale Villa Pineta's Pulmonary Rehabilitation Center, Pavullo-Modena, Italy, were randomized into 2 treatment groups. Group 1 consisted of those patients receiving PO <b>erdosteine</b> 225 mg BID and chest physiotherapy; group 2 comprised those patients receiving chest physiotherapy alone. Forced lung volumes, arterial blood gases, respiratory muscle strength, walking capacity (as measured by 6 -minute walking test [6 MWT]), and visual analog scale (VAS) symptoms (cough and dyspnea) were recorded at enrollment and at the conclusion of the study. Mucus density (MD), mucus purulence (MP), and mucus volume produced (MVP) were assessed using a 3 -point scale (0 = best or low; 1 = moderate; and 2 = worst or high) at baseline and at 5 -day time points during the study period. All measurements were assessed by personnel blinded and not directly associated with the study administration. RESULTS: Thirty patients (21 [70 %] male and 9 [30 %] female; mean [SD] age, 71 [11] years; and mean [SD] weight, 66 [3] kg) were enrolled. Characteristics were similar in the 2 groups at baseline. At day 15, significant improvements were observed in 6 MWT, VAS cough, and VAS dyspnea (P < 0. 01) in both groups. However, a significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity (in milliliters) was observed only in group i (0. 2 [0. 3]; P < 0. 05). At day 15, improvement was observed in mean (SD) in MD, MP, and MVP scores for both groups. Significant changes, however, were observed in all 3 measurements in group 1 (- 0. 80 [0. 22], - 0. 71 [0. 51], and 1. 01 [0. 39], respectively), whereas a significant improvement was observed only in MD (- 0. 55 [0. 44]) and MVP (0. 45 [0. 62]) in group 2.

The stability indicating ability of the method was determined by performing forced degradation studies which indicated susceptibility of the drug under acidic and neutral hydrolytic conditions. Separation of drug from its degradation products was achieved by isocratic elution using a mobile phase consisting of Acetonitrile : 0. 01 M Phosphate buffer,pH 5. 8 (80 : 20 v/v) through a HiQSil C 18 column (250 X 4. 6 mm, 5 μm) at a flow rate of 1 ml min- 1 with UV-detection(270 nm) at ambient temperature. Validation of the developed HPLC method was performed using an external standard. The method {{was found to be}} linear over a range of 5 - 50 μg ml- 1 and demonstrated to be precise, accurate,specific and robust.

40|$|Aim: In this study, {{the effects}} of <b>erdosteine</b> (ED) on the {{platelet}} function and coagulation were investigated in adult rats. Materials and Method: Twenty-eight male Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups. The control rats in group I (n 7) were given only 0. 5 cc of normal saline daily through oral gavage. Group II (n 7) rats were administered 3 mg/kg ED through oral gavage for 3 days; while group III (n 7) rats were given 10 mg/kg ED through oral gavage for 3 days; and group IV (n 7) rats were administered 30 mg/kg ED through oral gavage for 3 days. Prothrombin time (PT), activated prothromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio (INR), coagulation factors and complete blood counts were measured from the blood drawn. Results: There {{were a lot of}} differences between ED groups and control group, and among ED groups. The found differences were level of PT, aPTT, INR, coagulation factors, and number of platelets. Discussion: We consider that ED which is used as a mucolytic agent in child clinics may affect hemostasis and coagulation in a dose-dependent manner. ED should be used carefully by the patients with coagulation disorders, since there is no information available in the package insert and literature screening regarding the effect of ED...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCigarette/tobacco smoke/biomass fuel-induced {{oxidative}} and aldehyde/carbonyl stress {{are intimately}} {{associated with the}} progression and exacerbation of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Therefore, targeting systemic and local oxidative stress with antioxidants/redox modulating agents, or boosting the endogenous levels of antioxidants are likely to have beneficial effects in the treatment/management of COPD. Various antioxidant agents, such as thiol molecules (glutathione and mucolytic drugs, such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine and N-acystelyn, <b>erdosteine,</b> fudosteine, ergothioneine, and carbocysteine), have been reported to modulate various cellular and biochemical aspects of COPD. These antioxidants have been found to scavenge and detoxify free radicals and oxidants, regulate of glutathione biosynthesis, control nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, and hence inhibiting inflammatory gene expression. Synthetic molecules, such as specific spin traps like α-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone, a catalytic antioxidant (ECSOD mimetic), porphyrins (AEOL 10150 and AEOL 10113), and a superoxide dismutase mimetic M 40419, iNOS and myeloperoxidase inhibitors, lipid peroxidation inhibitors/blockers edaravone, and lazaroids/tirilazad have also been shown to have beneficial effects by inhibiting cigarette smoke-induced inflammatory responses and other carbonyl/oxidative stress-induced cellular alterations. A variety of oxidants, free radicals, and carbonyls/aldehydes are implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD, it is therefore, possible that therapeutic administration or supplementation of multiple antioxidants and/or boosting the endogenous levels of antioxidants will be beneficial in the treatment of COPD. This review discusses various novel pharmacological approaches adopted to enhance lung antioxidant levels, and various emerging beneficial and/or prophylactic effects of antioxidant therapeutics in halting or intervening the progression of COPD.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of <b>erdosteine</b> (ER), a mucolytic agent with antioxidant activity, on systemic inflammation, symptoms, recurrence of exacerbation, and time to first exacerbation postdischarge in hospitalized patients with AECOPD. Patients and methods: Patients admitted to hospital with AECOPD were randomized to receive either ER 900 mg daily (n= 20) or a matching control (n= 20). Treatment was continued for 10 days until discharge. Patients also received standard treatment with steroids, nebulized bronchodilators, and antibiotics as appropriate. Serum C-reactive protein levels, lung function, and breathlessness–cough–sputum scale were measured on hospital admission and thereafter at days 10 and 30 posttreatment. Recurrence of AECOPD-requiring antibiotics and/or oral steroids and time to first exacerbation in the 2 months (days 30 and 60) postdischarge were also assessed. Results: Mean serum C-reactive protein levels were lower in both groups at days 10 and 30, compared with those on admission, with significantly lower levels in the ER group at day 10. Improvements in symptom score and forced expiratory volume in 1 second were greater in the ER than the control group, which reached statistical significance on day 10. ER was associated with a 39 % lower risk of exacerbations and a significant delay in time to first exacerbation (log-rank test P= 0. 009 and 0. 075 at days 30 and 60, respectively) compared with controls. Conclusion: Results confirm that the addition of ER (900 mg/d) to standard treatment improves outcomes {{in patients with}} AECOPD. ER significantly reduced airway inflammation, improved the symptoms of AECOPD, and prolonged time to first exacerbation. The authors suggest ER could be most beneficial in patients with recurring, prolonged, and/or severe exacerbations of COPD.

40|$|Abstract Background Bronchiectasis is {{predominantly}} an acquired disease process {{that represents the}} end stage {{of a variety of}} unrelated pulmonary insults. It is defined as persistent irreversible dilatation and distortion of medium-sized bronchi. It has been suggested that with widespread use of high-resolution computed tomography, more bronchiectasis diagnoses are being made. Patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis frequently have difficulty expectorating sputum. Sputum therefore is retained in the lungs and may become infected, leading to further lung damage. Mucolytic agents target hypersecretion or changed physiochemical properties of sputum {{to make it easier to}} clear. One drug, recombinant human DNase, breaks down the DNA that is released at the site of infection by neutrophils. Mucus clearance along with antimicrobial therapy remains an integral part of bronchiectasis management. Chest physiotherapy along with mucolytic agents is commonly used in practice without clear supportive evidence. Objectives To determine whether ingested or inhaled mucolytics are effective in the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted experts in the field and drug companies. Searches were current as of June 2013. Selection criteria Randomised trials of mucolytic treatment in people with bronchiectasis but not cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Data extraction was performed independently by two review authors. Study authors were contacted for confirmation. Main results Four trials (with a combined total of 528 adult participants) were included, but almost none of the data from these studies could be aggregated in a meta-analysis. One trial (with 88 participants) compared bromhexine versus placebo. Compared with placebo, high doses of bromhexine with antibiotics eased difficulty in expectoration (mean difference (MD) - 0. 53, 95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 81 to - 0. 25 at 16 days); the quality of the evidence was rated as low. A reduction in sputum production was noted with bromhexine (MD - 21. 5 %, 95 % CI - 38. 9 to - 4. 1 at day 16); again the quality of the evidence was rated as low. No significant differences between bromhexine and placebo were observed with respect to reported adverse events (odds ratio (OR) 2. 93; 95 % CI 0. 12 to 73. 97), and again the quality of the evidence was rated as low. In a single small, blinded but not placebo-controlled trial of older (> 55 years) participants with stable bronchiectasis and mucus hypersecretion, <b>erdosteine</b> combined with physiotherapy over a 15 -day period improved spirometry and sputum purulence more effectively compared with physiotherapy alone. The spirometric improvement was small (MD 200 mL in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and 300 mL in forced vital capacity (FVC)) and was apparent only at day 15, not at earlier time points. The remaining two studies (with a combined total of 410 participants) compared recombinant human DNase (RhDNase) versus placebo. These two studies were very different (one was a two-week study of 61 participants, and the other ran for 24 weeks and included 349 participants), and the opportunity for combining data from the two studies was very limited. Compared with placebo, recombinant human DNase showed no difference in FEV 1 or FVC in the smaller study but showed a significant negative effect on FEV 1 in the larger and longer study. For reported adverse events, no significant differences between recombinant human DNase and placebo were noted. In all of the above comparisons of recombinant human DNase versus placebo, the quality of the evidence was judged to be low. Authors' conclusions Given the harmful effects of recombinant human DNase in one trial and no evidence of benefit, this drug should be avoided in non–cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, except in the context of clinical trials. Evidence is insufficient to permit evaluation of the routine use of other mucolytics for bronchiectasis. High doses of bromhexine coupled with antibiotics may help with sputum production and clearance, but long-term data and robust clinical outcomes are lacking. Similarly, <b>erdosteine</b> may be a useful adjunct to physiotherapy in stable patients with mucus hypersecretion, but robust longer-term trials are required. Generally, clinical trials in children on the use of various mucolytic agents are lacking. As the number of agents available on the market, such as RhDNase, acetylcysteine and bromhexine, is increasing, improvement of the evidence base is needed. Plain language summary Mucolytic drugs (to help make phlegm easier to cough up) for people with bronchiectasis Review question: This review considered the question of whether mucolytics may be helpful for people with bronchiectasis who do not also have cystic fibrosis. Studies of participants with cystic fibrosis were not included in this review, and we are unable to draw any conclusions on this treatment's relevance to people with cystic fibrosis. Background: Bronchiectasis is a lung condition that usually develops after a series of lung problems (such as childhood infections, problems in lung structure, tuberculosis and cystic fibrosis). A lot of mucus (phlegm) collects in the lungs, causing discomfort and the need to cough it up. The phlegm also collects bacteria, which can add to breathing difficulties. Mucolytic drugs break down phlegm, which can make it easier to cough up. Study characteristics: Four studies (with a total of 528 participants) were identified that met the inclusion criterion of comparing mucolytic treatment versus no mucolytic treatment. All studies were conducted in adults. One study considered bromhexine versus placebo, two compared RhDNase versus placebo (one for a period of two weeks and the other over a period of 24 weeks) and the fourth compared <b>erdosteine</b> with physiotherapy versus physiotherapy alone in elderly patients. The small number of studies available for review and their different designs meant that only descriptions of the individual studies were possible with very limited opportunities for combining the studies in single analyses. Key results: No strong evidence is available to support the use of these drugs in people with bronchiectasis (from causes other than cystic fibrosis); however it is not possible to draw any clear conclusions, as so few studies have been reported. Quality of the evidence: Details of the way patients were allocated to receive or not receive mucolytics were not clearly described in any of the four studies. This was considered carefully in the review in relation to our level of uncertainty in interpreting the results. When this is taken into account, together with the imprecision of the results, estimates of the usefulness of mucolytics as treatment were generally judged to be of low quality in relation to (non–cystic fibrosis) bronchiectasis...|$|E
