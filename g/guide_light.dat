The direct drive system was also incorporated at the time. This lighthouse was earlier known as Periyar river lighthouse.A fixed light of 11 miles range was exhibited from a mast of 96 feet high by the State Port department in 1964 near the Port entrance and it worked till the commissioning of the new light in 1982.

50|$|Other {{types of}} optical {{waveguide}} are also used, including photonic-crystal fiber, which guides waves {{by any of}} several distinct mechanisms. Guides {{in the form of}} a hollow tube with a highly reflective inner surface have also been used as light pipes for illumination applications. The inner surfaces may be polished metal, or may be covered with a multilayer film that guides light by Bragg reflection (this is a special case of a photonic-crystal fiber). One can also use small prisms around the pipe which reflect light via total internal reflection http://www.physics.ubc.ca/ssp/research/lightpipe.htm - such confinement is necessarily imperfect, however, since total internal reflection can never truly <b>guide</b> <b>light</b> within a lower-index core (in the prism case, some light leaks out at the prism corners).|$|E

50|$|The <b>Guiding</b> <b>Light</b> was {{broadcast}} first by CBS Television on June 30, 1952, replacing the canceled soap opera The First Hundred Years. These episodes were also 15 minutes long. During {{the period from}} 1952 to 1956, The <b>Guiding</b> <b>Light</b> existed as both a radio and television serial, with actors recording their performances twice for each day that the shows were broadcast. The radio broadcast of The <b>Guiding</b> <b>Light</b> ceased production during 1956, ending this overlap.|$|R
5000|$|A {{reflector}} with an approximately parabolic shape concentrates {{the light}} emitted by the bulb into a directed beam. Some flashlights allow {{the user to}} adjust the relative position of the lamp and reflector, giving a variable-focus effect from a wide floodlight to a narrow beam. Reflectors may be made of polished metal, or glass or plastic with an aluminized reflective finish. Some manufacturers use a pebbled or [...] "orange peel", instead of a smooth, reflector, to improve the uniformity of the light beam emitted. Where multiple LEDs are used, each one may be put in its own parabolic reflector. Flashlights using a [...] "total internal reflection" [...] assembly have a transparent optical element (light pipe) to <b>guide</b> <b>light</b> from the source into a beam; no reflector surface is required. For a given size of light source, a larger reflector or lens allows a tighter beam to be produced, while capturing the same fraction of the emitted light.|$|E
50|$|In modern double-clad fibers {{for high}} power fiber {{amplifiers}} and lasers, the inner cladding {{has a higher}} refractive index than the outer cladding. This enables the inner cladding to <b>guide</b> <b>light</b> by total internal reflection {{in the same way}} the core does, but for a different range of wavelengths. This allows diode lasers, which have high power but low brightness, to be used as the optical pump source. The pump light can be easily coupled into the large inner cladding, and propagates through the inner cladding while the signal propagates in the smaller core. The doped core gradually absorbs the cladding light as it propagates, driving the amplification process. This pumping scheme is often called cladding pumping, which is an alternative to the conventional core pumping, in which the pump light is coupled into the small core. The invention of cladding pumping by a Polaroid fiber research team (H. Po, et al.) revolutionized the design of fiber amplifiers and lasers. Using this method, modern fiber lasers can produce continuous power up to several kilowatts, while the signal light in the core maintains near diffraction-limited beam quality.|$|E
50|$|The hybrid {{plasmonic}} waveguide {{was first}} {{proposed by the}} researchers at the University of Toronto in 2007. The invention was motivated by the observation that the advantages and limitations of dielectric and plasmonic waveguides are complementary. Dielectric waveguides use total internal reflection to confine light in a high index region. They can <b>guide</b> <b>light</b> over a long distance with very low loss, but their light confinement ability is limited by diffraction. Plasmonic waveguides, on the other hand, use surface plasmon to confine light near a metal surface. The light confinement ability of plasmonic waveguides is not limited by diffraction, and, as a result, they can confine light to very small volumes. However, these guides suffer significant propagation loss {{because of the presence}} of metal as part of the guiding structure. The aim of designing the hybrid plasmonic waveguide was to combine these two different wave guiding schemes and achieve high light confinement without suffering large loss. Since the seminal work published in 2007, many different variations of this structure have been proposed. One such structure was proposed by Xiang Zhang's group of the University of California at Berkeley, who also coined the phrase hybrid plasmonic waveguide. Many other types of hybrid plasmonic waveguides have been proposed since then to improve light confinement ability or to reduce fabrication complexity.|$|E

5000|$|Photonic crystal fibers can {{be divided}} into two modes of operation, {{according}} to their mechanism for confinement. Those with a solid core, or a core with a higher average index than the microstructured cladding, can operate on the same index-guiding principle as conventional optical fiber — however, they can have a much higher effective- refractive index contrast between core and cladding, and therefore can have much stronger confinement for applications in nonlinear optical devices, polarization-maintaining fibers, (or they can also be made with much lower effective index contrast). Alternatively, one can create a [...] "photonic bandgap" [...] fiber, in which the light is confined by a photonic bandgap created by the microstructured cladding - such a bandgap, properly designed, can confine light in a lower-index core and even a hollow (air) core. Bandgap fibers with hollow cores can potentially circumvent limits imposed by available materials, for example to create fibers that <b>guide</b> <b>light</b> in wavelengths for which transparent materials are not available (because the light is primarily in the air, not in the solid materials). Another potential advantage of a hollow core is that one can dynamically introduce materials into the core, such as a gas that is to be analyzed for the presence of some substance. PCF can also be modified by coating the holes with sol-gels of similar or different index material to enhance its transmittance of light.|$|E
5000|$|Following the gunnery duel and an {{air attack}} of the island at 06:10, the naval {{bombardment}} of the island began in earnest and was sustained {{for the next three}} hours. Two minesweepers, with two destroyers to provide covering fire, entered the lagoon in the pre-dawn hours and cleared the shallows of mines. A <b>guide</b> <b>light</b> from one of the minesweepers then guided the landing craft into the lagoon, where they awaited the end of the bombardment. The plan was to land Marines on the north beaches, divided into three sections: Red Beach 1 on the far west of the island, Red Beach 2 in the center just west of the pier, and Red Beach 3 to the east of the pier. Green Beach was a contingency landing beach on the western shoreline and was used for the D+1 landings. Black Beaches 1 and 2 made up the southern shore of the island and were not used. The airstrip, running roughly east-west, divided the island into north and south.Marine battle planners had expected the normal rising tide to provide a water depth of 5 feet over the reef, allowing their four-foot draft Higgins boats room to spare. However, on this day and the next, the ocean experienced a neap tide, and failed to rise. In the words of some observers, [...] "the ocean just sat there", leaving a mean depth of three feet over the reef. Unfortunately, the task force commander had rejected advice from a New Zealand liaison officer with experience of the island that the tide would be unsuitable {{on the day of the}} landing.|$|E
