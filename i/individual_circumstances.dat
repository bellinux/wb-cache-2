5|$|The {{architecture}} and internal layout of these missions followed a scheme which was repeated later with some {{variations in the}} rest of the missionary reductions. In Chiquitos, the oldest mission, San Xavier, formed the basis for the organizational style, which consisted of a modular structure, the center formed by a wide rectangular square, with the church complex on one side and the houses of the inhabitants on the three remaining sides. The centralized organization of the Jesuits dictated a certain uniformity of measures and sizes. Despite being based on the same basic model, the towns of Chiquitos nonetheless show remarkable variations. For example, the orientation of the settlements toward the cardinal points differed and was determined by <b>individual</b> <b>circumstances.</b>|$|E

25|$|As {{with nearly}} all {{political}} parties that had existed under the Third Republic, the PSF produced both collaborators with and resisters of the Vichy regime. In most cases, <b>individual</b> <b>circumstances</b> dictated more ambiguous loyalties and actions: although former PSF deputy Jean Ybarnegaray, for instance, {{served in the}} first Vichy government under Pétain as Minister for Veterans and the Family; he resigned his post in 1940 and was in 1943 arrested and deported due to his efforts in helping Resistance members to cross the Pyrenees into Spain.|$|E
25|$|Various {{architectural}} {{models have}} different costs and benefits. Likewise, stand-alone, provider-tethered, and payer-tethered PHRs have different {{advantages and disadvantages}} for patients related to their <b>individual</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Such differences are among the priority areas in PHR research. As PHRs may play key role in advancing health information exchange, interoperability with other health IT systems is an important consideration for PHR architecture.

25|$|These {{statistics}} {{point to}} the complexities surrounding the lack of health/nutrition literacy and reveal {{the degree to which}} they are embedded in the social structure and interconnected with other problems. Among these problems are the lack of information about food choices, a lack of understanding of nutritional information and its application to <b>individual</b> <b>circumstances,</b> limited or difficult access to healthful foods, and a range of cultural influences and socioeconomic constraints such as low levels of education and high levels of poverty that decrease opportunities for healthful eating and living.|$|E
25|$|The {{mandatory}} {{nature of}} Harmelin's sentence {{also did not}} require setting it aside. First, as Scalia agreed, the Eighth Amendment did not require the trial court to allow Harmelin to present mitigating evidence. Second, if the Court were to set Harmelin's sentence aside, it would necessarily have to reject {{the judgment of the}} legislature, where the initial responsibility for making the substantive judgment about appropriate punishments rests. Third, Michigan's system did not entirely lack mechanisms for considering the <b>individual</b> <b>circumstances</b> of a particular defendant. Prosecutors have discretion in bringing charges, the governor has the power to grant clemency post hoc, and the legislature has the power to retroactively modify the sentence for all persons convicted of Harmelin's crime.|$|E
25|$|The {{same rules}} in {{principle}} {{apply to the}} matrilineal descendants of such persons, though some rabbinical authorities may require stricter proof of Jewish descent than others. Whether such persons are required to undergo a full formal conversion depends on the community and their <b>individual</b> <b>circumstances.</b> For example, a male {{who has had a}} brit milah, who has a general understanding of Judaism, but who has been raised in a secular home might not be required to undergo ritual conversion. However, a male who has not had a brit milah, a male or female who has converted to or been brought up in another religion, or an individual raised in a completely secular home without any Jewish education, in most communities, may be required to undergo a full ritual conversion. For full participation in the community (for example, to marry with the participation of a rabbi), they may be required to display sincerity, such as a declaration of commitment to Judaism.|$|E

50|$|The net, deliberate, {{effect of}} these {{differences}} {{is to make the}} total combined impact gradually converge, over about 40 years, to an eventual situation where the total benefit is around £140 a week, whatever an <b>individual's</b> <b>circumstance.</b> Consequently, the Coalition government proposed replacing this complex system with a single flat-rate pension of about £140 per week, a policy which is currently being processed by Parliament.|$|R
25|$|In 1970, severe mercury poisoning, called Ontario Minamata disease, was {{discovered}} among Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation and Wabaseemoong Independent Nations people, who lived near Dryden, Ontario. There was extensive mercury pollution caused by Dryden Chemicals Company's waste water effluent in the Wabigoon-English River system. Because local fish {{were no longer}} safe to eat, the Ontario provincial government closed the commercial fisheries run by the First Nation people and ordered them to stop eating local fish. Previously it had made {{up the majority of}} their diet. In addition to the acute mercury poisoning in northwestern Ontario, Aamjiwnaang First Nation people near Sarnia, Ontario, experienced a wide range of chemical effects, including severe mercury poisoning. They suffered low birth rates, skewed birth-gender ratio, and health effects among the population. This led to legislation and eventually the Indian Health Transfer Policy that provided a framework for the assumption of control of health services by First Nations people, and set forth a developmental approach to transfer centred on the concept of self-determination in health. Through this process, the decision to enter into transfer discussions with Health Canada rests with each community. Once involved in transfer, communities are able to take control of health programme responsibilities at a pace determined by their <b>individual</b> <b>circumstances</b> and health management capabilities.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, {{the federal}} {{government}} announced the Aboriginal Right to Self-Government Policy. This policy recognizes that First Nations and Inuit have the constitutional right to shape their own forms of government to suit their particular historical, cultural, political and economic circumstances.

2500|$|There are two {{sorts of}} {{hearings}} that the Court of Appeal can hold; reviews, and full rehearings.
