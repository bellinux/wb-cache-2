25|$|However, most {{contemporary}} authors credit Daniel Khazzoom for the re-emergence of the rebound {{effect in the}} research literature. Although Khazzoom {{did not use the}} term, he raised {{the idea that there is}} a less than one-to-one correlation between gains in energy efficiency and reductions in energy use, because of a change in the 'price content' of energy in the provision of the <b>final</b> <b>consumer</b> product. His study was based on energy efficiency gains in home appliances, but the principle applies throughout the economy. A commonly studied example is that of a more fuel-efficient car. As each kilometre of travel becomes cheaper, there will be an increase in driving speed and/or kilometres driven, as long as the price elasticity of demand for car travel is not zero. Other examples might include the growth in garden lighting after the introduction of energy-saving compact fluorescent lamps or the increasing size of houses driven partly by higher fuel efficiency in home heating technologies. If the rebound effect is larger than 100%, all gains from the increased fuel efficiency would be wiped out by increases in demand (the Jevons paradox).|$|E
500|$|While {{many economists}} and tax experts support a {{consumption}} tax, problems could arise with using a retail sales tax {{rather than a}} value added tax (VAT). [...] A VAT imposes a tax on the value added at every intermediate step of production, so the goods reach the <b>final</b> <b>consumer</b> {{with much of the}} tax already in the price. The retail seller has little incentive to conceal retail sales, since he has already paid much of the good's tax. Retailers are unlikely to subsidize the consumer's tax evasion by concealing sales. In contrast, a retailer has paid no tax on goods under a sales tax system. This provides an incentive for retailers to conceal sales and engage in [...] "tax arbitrage" [...] by sharing some of the illicit tax savings with the <b>final</b> <b>consumer.</b> [...] Citing evasion, Tim Worstall wrote in Forbes that Europe’s 20-25% consumption taxes simply would not work if they were a sales tax: that’s why they’re all a VAT. [...] Laurence Kotlikoff has stated that the government could compel firms to report, via 1099-type forms, their sales to other firms, which would provide the same records that arise under a VAT. [...] In the United States, a general sales tax is imposed in 45 states plus the District of Columbia (accounting for over 97% of both population and economic output), which proponents argue provides a large infrastructure for taxing sales that many countries do not have.|$|E

40|$|The service {{provided}} by financial {{institutions such as}} banks is described as an "intermediary service", linking depositors with money to lend and borrowers seeking loan funds. Banks collect a fee for these services through the spread on interest they pay to depositors and charge to borrowers. At present, the VAT system operates in a complex way to impose a tax on this service that {{is lower than the}} full tax imposed on other services. As the VAT is intended to be a tax on <b>final</b> <b>consumers</b> only, normally business customers are allowed to recover fully any tax they pay on acquisitions used in the business. However, they are not permitted to recover the VAT embedded in the price of financial intermediary supplies. Conventional analysis of VAT and financial intermediary services suggests the partial taxation system undertaxes <b>final</b> <b>consumers</b> and overtaxes business. In recent years some countries have moved to address these problems by relieving business from VAT on financial intermediary supplies and increasing it for <b>final</b> <b>consumers.</b> This article tests the assumption that current rules overtax business and undertax <b>final</b> <b>consumers</b> and reviews the alternative systems that have been proposed...|$|R

In order to attain this goal we conducted a survey through face-to-face interviews in the Minho region. The results show that the dominant factor of influence in the acquisition of wine is the region of origin, both for <b>final</b> <b>consumers</b> and small retailers. Despite its importance, brand was not the principal variable that influences the consumer wine choice, while price has been regarded as a less important extrinsic quality cue. One interesting result is the type of wine (“maduro ” or “verde”) which seems to be the most preferred intrinsic cue for <b>final</b> <b>consumers</b> and small retailers. The findings also indicate that regions of Alentejo, Douro and Verde are far and away the leaders in terms of customer acceptance. ...|$|R

2500|$|Sales {{taxes are}} levied when a {{commodity}} is sold to its <b>final</b> <b>consumer.</b> Retail organizations contend that such taxes discourage retail sales. The {{question of whether}} they are generally progressive or regressive is a subject of much current debate. People with higher incomes spend a lower proportion of them, so a flat-rate sales tax will tend to be regressive. It is therefore common to exempt food, utilities and other necessities from sales taxes, since poor people spend {{a higher proportion of}} their incomes on these commodities, so such exemptions make the tax more progressive. This is the classic [...] "You pay for what you spend" [...] tax, as only those who spend money on non-exempt (i.e. luxury) items pay the tax.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a manufacturer’s incentive to sell through an independent retailer, rather than directly to <b>final</b> <b>consumers,</b> when contracts with retailers cannot be observed by competitors. If retailers conjecture that identical competing manufacturers always offer identical contracts (symmetric beliefs), manufacturers choose vertical separation in equilibrium. Even with private contracts, vertically sep-arated manufacturers reduce competition and increase profits by inducing less aggressive behaviour by retailers {{in the final}} market. Manufacturers profits may be higher with private than with public contracts. Our results hold both with price and with quantity competition and do not hinge on retailers beliefs being perfectly symmetric. We also discuss various justifications for symmetric beliefs, including incomplete information. Can competing manufacturers obtain higher profits by delegating retail decisions to independent agents, rather than selling directly to <b>final</b> <b>consumers?</b> Manufacturers jointly benefit from high retail prices but, when they sell directly to <b>final</b> <b>consumers,</b> competition among them results in low prices and profits. However, a manufacturer can induce an independent retailer to sell at higher prices, by charging a wholesale price higher than marginal cost. And credibly committing to doing so has a strategic effect on rival retailers, who react by selling at higher prices themselves, thus reducin...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explains}} the Lisbon Treaty’s provisions relating to competition policy {{and offers a}} dynamic interpretation of Article 102 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which could justify the consideration of an effects-based approach to those anti-competitive practices that are most harmful to the <b>final</b> <b>consumers</b> under the economic theory of consumer welfare. The implications of ‘consumerprotection requirements’ must shed special light on Article 12 TFEU. Therefore, {{this article examines the}} possibility of shifting the courts’ teleological interpretation of Article 102, which is based on Protocol 27 ’s ‘undistorted competition’, towards a legal balancing test of the Treaty’s objectives. It also highlights the interpretation of undistorted competition within the internal market and the interplay between EU ‘free’ and fair and unfair competition rules. The balance of EU competition law should, therefore, be performed between Article 119 TFEU’s free competition or economic freedom-based competition and Article 12 as ensuring a ‘high level of protection’, as embedded in the Treaty, for the <b>final</b> <b>consumers.</b> This article explains how consumer-protection requirements must be defined narrowly so that Article 12 may be applied to Article 102. Article 12 can, therefore, mandate a high level of consumer protection for the <b>final</b> <b>consumers</b> in implementing such a specific policy as the abuse of dominance...|$|R
40|$|A common fraud by {{registered}} {{traders in}} the value-added tax system is under-reporting sales and over-reporting purchases.

The results highlight the importance of taxpayer’s subjective beliefs in shaping audit policy of the tax authority. The optimal audit rate for risk-neutral firms is an increasing function of transaction with <b>final</b> <b>consumers,</b> but this relationship may turn to be negative for risk-averse taxpayers. Moreover, the optimal level of invoice cross-checking on transactions of each commodity is positively associated with the number of trading firms...|$|R
