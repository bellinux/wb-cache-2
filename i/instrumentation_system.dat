500|$|The {{second stage}} of {{construction}} in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the tower was under the charge of the Vatican librarian, involved Mgr. Filippo Luigi Gilii, a clergyman of St. Peter's Basilica. Earlier in 1797, Pius VI gave approval to placing a Latin inscription Specula Vaticana {{at the entrance to}} the upper part of the tower, which was implemented by Cardinal Zelada with plans to enhance the <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> in the tower's observatory. The original observatory was then set up above the second level of the tower with the agreement of Pope Pius VI. Its instrumentation, apart from many normal devices (such as meteorological and magnetic equipment, with a seismograph and a small transit and pendulum clock,) was noted for the Dolland Telescope. The instrumentation facilitated recording of occurrences of eclipse, appearance of comets, Satellites of Jupiter and Mercury’s transit. As an addition, under the patronage of Pope Pius X, four rotary observatory domes were also added at strategic locations on the [...] long fortification walls, more than a thousand years old.|$|E

50|$|The flight <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> is {{composed}} of a primary instrumentation package and an auxiliary package. The primary package instrumentation measures those parameters critical to all engine static firings and subsequent vehicle launches.

The <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> is designed for use throughout {{the life of the}} engine, from the first static acceptance firing to its ultimate vehicle flight. The auxiliary package is designed for use during early vehicle flights. It may be deleted from the basic engine <b>instrumentation</b> <b>system</b> after the propulsion system has established its reliability during research and development vehicle flights. It contains sufficient flexibility to provide for deletion, substitution, or addition of parameters deemed necessary as a result of additional testing.
