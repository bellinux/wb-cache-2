5|$|Guinea fowl {{originated}} in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the <b>helmeted</b> <b>guineafowl</b> (Numida meleagris). It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird {{with a small}} naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top, and was domesticated {{by the time of}} the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of perhaps a hundred common or generic plant and animal names, Esperanto adopts the international binomial nomenclature of living organisms, using suitable orthography, and changing the nominal and adjectival grammatical endings to -o and -a. For example, the binomial for the guineafowl is Numida meleagris. In Esperanto, therefore, a numido would be any bird of the genus Numida, and a meleagra numido the <b>helmeted</b> <b>guineafowl</b> specifically. Likewise, a numidedo is any bird in the guineafowl family Numidid√¶.|$|E

40|$|Seventy-six <b>helmeted</b> <b>guineafowls</b> (Numida meleagris) {{were shot}} in the Andries Vosloo Kudu Reserve and on an {{adjacent}} farm in the eastern Cape Province during the period May 1985 to January 1987 and their tick burdens determined. A total of 10 ixodid tick species were recovered, of which Amblyomma hebraeum, Amblyomma marmoreum and Haemaphysalis silacea were the most abundant. The seasonal abundances of these 3 species and of Hyalomma marginatum rufipes were ascertained. A marked difference between {{the total number of}} A. hebraeum recovered from the birds in the reserve and those on the farm is ascribed to the treatment of domestic stock on the farm with an acaricide. The tick burdens of 118 <b>helmeted</b> <b>guineafowls,</b> {{shot in the}} southern part of the Kruger National Park, eastern Transvaal Lowveld, from August 1988 to August 1990, were also determined. Ten ixodid tick species and the larvae of an argasid species were recovered. A. hebraeum, A. marmoreum and the Argas sp. were the most abundant and their seasonal abundances and that of Rhipicephalus zambeziensis were determined. Only 2 of the 54 659 ixodid ticks recovered from the birds at the 3 localities were adults and the presence of these is ascribed to accidental infestations.

40|$|The {{tortoise}} tick Amblyomma marmoreum {{was collected}} from {{large numbers of}} reptiles and other animals {{during the course of}} numerous surveys conducted in South Africa. A total of 1 229 ticks, of which 550 were adults, were recovered from 309 reptiles belonging to 13 species, with leopard tortoises, Geochelone pardalis being the most heavily infested. The 269 birds sampled harboured 4 901 larvae, 217 nymphs and no adult ticks, and the prevalence of infestation was greatest on hel meted guinea fowls, Numida meleagris. Only two larvae were recovered from 610 rodents, including 31 spring hares, Pedetes capensis, whereas 1 144 other small mammals yielded 1 835 immature ticks, of which 1 655 were collected from 623 scrub hares, Lepus saxatilis. The 213 carnivores examined harboured 2 459 ticks of which none were adult. A single adult tick and 6 684 larvae and 62 nymphs were recovered from 656 large herbivores, and a total of 4 081 immature ticks and three adults were collected from 1 543 domestic animals and 194 humans. Adult male and female A. marmoreum were most numerous on reptiles during January and February, and larvae during March. The largest numbers of larvae were present on domestic cattle and <b>helmeted</b> <b>guineafowls</b> in the Eastern Cape Province during March or April respectively, whereas larvae were most numerous on <b>helmeted</b> <b>guineafowls,</b> scrub hares and the vegetation in north-eastern Mpumalanga Province during May. In both provinces nymphs were most numerous between October and December. Amblyomma marmoreum appears to be most prevalent in the western regions of the Western and Eastern Cape and Free State provinces, and the north-eastern regions of the Northern Cape, KwaZulu- Natal, Mpumulanga and Limpopo provinces. </span...|$|R
40|$|Published and {{personal}} records have been compiled into a reference {{list of the}} helminth parasites of guineafowls. Where data on other avian hosts was available these have been included for completeness' sake and to give an indication of host range. The parasite list for the <b>Helmeted</b> <b>guineafowls,</b> Numida meleagris, includes five species of acanthocephalans, all belonging to a single genus, three trematodes belonging to three different genera, 34 cestodes representing 15 genera, and 35 nematodes belonging to 17 genera. The list for the Crested guineafowls, Guttera edouardi, contains a single acanthocephalan together with 10 cestode species belonging to seven genera, and three nematode species belonging to three different genera. Records for two cestode species from genera and two nematode species belonging to a single genus have been found for the guineafowl genus Acryllium.

Ninety-eight (86 %) of 114 guineafowls had single or multiple infections of Aegyptianella sp., Haemoproteus pratasi, Hepatozoon sp., Leucocytozoon neavei, Plasmodium circumflexum and Trypanosoma numidae. The apparent seasonal prevalence of Aegyptianella sp., H. pratasi and L. neavei, the three most commonly occurring parasites (42 %, 49 % and 56 % of birds infected respectively), is probably dependent {{on the presence of}} their respective vectors.

40|$|Aegyptianella botuliformis n. sp. (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae) {{isolated}} from <b>helmeted</b> <b>guineafowls</b> Numida meleagris from the Kruger National Park is described. The rickettsia occurs within a membrane-bound vacuole in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes {{with up to}} 8 organisms in a mature inclusion. The initial body resembles that of Aegyptianella pullorum. The tightly packed, sausage-shaped intermediate forms are a distinctive morphological feature, seen as irregular, pleomorphic forms under light microscopy. While more larvae and nymphs of Amblyomma hebraeum and Amblyomma marmoreaum {{were found on the}} birds than larvae of an Argas sp., it is believed that the latter are the vectors of A. botuliformis n. sp.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the species spectrum of ixodid ticks infesting birds in Free State Province, South Africa. To this end a large number of birds belonging to several species were examined for ticks and a total of 180 birds belonging to 39 species at 17 localities were infested, and ticks belonging to eight species were recovered. The immature stages of only two, namely Amblyomma marmoreum and Hyalomma marginatum rufipes, were sufficiently prevalent and numerous to safely assume that they regularly use birds as hosts. <b>Helmeted</b> <b>guineafowls,</b> Numida meleagris, were the most heavily infested and one harboured a total of 319 larvae and four nymphs. Amongst the other species an eastern clapper lark, Mirafra fasciolata, was infested with 69 larvae and a nymph, but no other bird harboured more than 40 ticks. The larvae and nymphs of H. m. rufipes were most numerous on birds from April to August. </span...|$|R

40|$|Birds are {{hosts of}} the {{immature}} stages of several ixodid tick species (Theiler 1962) and consequent-ly {{could serve as}} a source of subsequent adult tick infestation for other hosts. This is particularly so for migrating birds (Hoogstraal, Kaiser, Traylor, Gaber & Guindy 1961), or species such as helmeted guinea-fowls, Numida meleagris, that on occasion can har-bour large numbers of immature ticks (Horak & Williams 1986; Horak, Spickett, Braack & Williams 1991). Two species of guineafowls and several spe-cies of francolins occur in South Africa and of these the ixodid tick burdens of <b>helmeted</b> <b>guineafowls,</b> Cape francolins, Francolinus capensis, and grey-wing francolins, Francolinus africanus, have been determined (Horak & Williams 1986; Horak et al. 1991; Horak & Boomker 1998). Similar data for crested francolins, Francolinus sephaena, or crest-ed guineafowls, Guttera pucherani, both of which occur in the northern and north-eastern regions of South Africa, have not been collected. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether crested francolins, which prefer thick cover and matted vegetation, play the same role as hel-meted guineafowls, which prefer thorny scrub and savanna veld, as hosts for the immature stages of ticks of veterinary importance.

40|$|An {{annotated}} host-parasite list of {{the blood}} parasites of domestic poultry in sub-Saharan Africa is presented. This list contains the haematozoa found in domestic waterfowl (ducks, geese and muscovies) and phasianids (turkey, fowl and peafowl). In South Africa Plasmodium durae was isolated from 4 out of 8 backyard turkeys, from 3 out of 26 Swainson's francolins and from 1 redwing francolin, but not from 20 <b>helmeted</b> <b>guineafowls</b> and 9 greywing francolins. This points at Swainson's and redwing francolins as being the main natural hosts of P. durae in South Africa. The increase {{in the period of}} prepatency after intramuscular subinoculation as compared with the intravenous route was found to correspond to that of a 1 000 fold dilution of an intravenous inoculum of parasitized blood. This delay was not due to an intervening cycle of exoerythrocytic schizogony, but to large numbers of the injected erythrocytes apparently not finding their way into the circulation of the new host.

40|$|The helminths of 15 <b>Helmeted</b> <b>Guineafowls</b> were {{collected}} {{in the north of}} Limpopo Province, South Africa. A total of 11 cestode, ten nematode and a single acanthocephalan species were present. Species richness ranged from 8 to 16 species per host, and nine core and nine secondary species accounted for 40. 9 % of the component parasite community. The remaining 18. 2 % comprised satellite species. Core species represented 91 % of all the worms present. Individual intensities ranged from 66 to 2 724 per host and overdispersion was pronounced. There were no significant differences regarding the abundance and species richness between male and female hosts. The number of component species and overall abundance did not differ significantly between juvenile and adult hosts, but Cyrnea parroti was significantly more abundant, and the prevalence of Hadjelia truncata was higher in young birds than in adults.
