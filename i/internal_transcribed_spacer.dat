5|$|Molecular {{analyses}} of the <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus, but morphological identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species.

5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> DNA sequences shows that C.vinicolor {{groups in a}} clade with the closely related C.jamaicensis and C.pseudovinicolor. All of these species feature darkly-amyloid flesh and thick-walled cystidia. Based on this analysis, Miller considered C.jamaicensis to be insufficiently distinct genetically from C.vinicolor to warrant designation as a separate species; however, as of 2012, both MycoBank and Index Fungorum list it as a valid species.|$|E

5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} shown that the current species concept for H.repandum may need {{revision}} as there is a poor overlap between morphological and molecular species concepts. Phylogenetic analysis of European specimens, based on <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> and 5.8S DNA sequences, indicates that H.repandum specimens form two distinct clades, whose only consistent morphological distinction is cap size. These genetic differences may indicate the presence of undescribed cryptic species, and that the taxon may currently be undergoing intensive speciation.|$|E

5|$|Amanita bisporigera {{belongs to}} section Phalloideae {{of the genus}} Amanita, which {{contains}} some of the deadliest Amanita species, including A.phalloides and A.virosa. This classification has been upheld with phylogenetic analyses, which demonstrate that the toxin-producing members of section Phalloideae form a clade—that is, they derive from a common ancestor. In 2005, Zhang and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> (ITS) sequences of several white-bodied toxic Amanita species, {{most of which are}} found in Asia. Their results support a clade containing A. bisporigera, A.subjunquillea var. alba, A.exitialis, and A.virosa. The Guangzhou destroying angel (Amanita exitialis) has two-spored basidia, like A.bisporigera.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, Vincent Demoulin {{described}} the species Lycoperdon americanum {{on the basis}} of a specimen found in North Carolina.

Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence and secondary structure of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes coding for the <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> units suggests that Lycoperdon echinatum forms a clade with the puffball genus Handkea, separate from the type species of Lycoperdon, Lycoperdon perlatum. In previous analyses that used only the rRNA sequences for phylogenetic comparison, L.echinatum formed a clade with L.mammiforme, L.foetidum, and Bovistella radicata (now known as Lycoperdon radicatum), but separate from L.pyriforme.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of {{nucleic acid sequences}} from the <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> and elongation factor EF-1α regions suggests that the genus Morchella {{can be divided into}} three lineages. M.rufobrunnea belongs to a lineage that is basal to the esculenta clade ("yellow morels"), and the elata clade ("black morels"). This phylogenetic placement implies that it has existed in its current form since the Cretaceous era (roughly 145 to 66 million years ago), and all known morel species evolved from a similar ancestor. M.rufobrunnea is genetically closer to the yellow morels than the black morels. M.anatolica, described from Turkey in 2012, is a closely related sister species.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of the DNA sequences of the <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> (IT) region of S.thailandica showed that the species {{was part of the}} Boletineae, one of several lineages of Boletales recognized taxonomically at the level of suborder. The similarity between S.thailandica and S.squarepantsii was confirmed with molecular analysis, which showed a 98% match between large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences of the two—a value typical of many species in the same genus of Boletaceae. Spongiforma is sister (sharing a common ancestor) to the genus Porphyrellus; Spongiforma and Porphyrellus form a clade that is sister to Strobilomyces. All three genera are members of the Boletaceae family.|$|E
40|$|We have {{determined}} the nucleotide sequences {{of the two}} <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacers,</b> the adjacent ribosomal coding sequences and {{the boundary between the}} external <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> and the 18 S coding sequence in a cloned ribosomal transcription unit from Xenopus borealis. The <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacers</b> differ very extensively from those of X. laevis. Nevertheless, embedded in the <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacers</b> are several short sequence elements which are identical between the two species. These conserved elements are laterally displaced by substantial distances in the X. borealis sequence with respect to that of X. laevis. These relative displacements imply that insertions and deletions have {{played a major role in}} <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> divergence in Xenopus. This in turn implies that large regions of the <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacers</b> do not play a sequence-specific role in ribosome maturation. In contrast, the sequenced parts of the ribosomal coding regions, which encompass 670 nucleotides, differ at only three points from the corresponding sequences in X. laevis, each by a single substitution.

5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} in the genus Sarcoscypha were analyzed by Francis Harrington in the late 1990s. The cladistic analysis combined comparison of sequences from the <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> in the non-functional RNA with fifteen traditional morphological characters, such as spore features, fruit body shape, and degree of hair curliness. Based on this analysis, S.dudleyi {{is part of a}} clade of evolutionarily related taxa that includes the species S.occidentalis, S.emarginata, S.hosoyae, S.korfiana and S.mesocyatha. All of these species contain large oil droplets in their spores, in contrast to the other major clade of Sarcoscypha (containing the type species S.coccinea), characterized by having smaller, more numerous droplets.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as new to science by mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912. Murrill collected the type material growing near redwoods near Searsville Lake, California, in December 1911. In 1914, Murrill {{decided that the}} species {{was the same as}} Lepiota cristata (which he called Lepiota conspurcata (Willd.) Morgan); this opinion was later corroborated by Walter Sundberg in 1989 after he studied the type collection and concluded that the microscopic characteristics of both were the same. Using molecular analysis based on comparing DNA sequences of the <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> region, mycologist Else Vellinga determined that despite the lack of distinguishing micro-morphological characteristics, the two species were distinct.|$|E
5|$|According to Rolf Singer's infrageneric {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Pluteus, the fungus belongs in the section Celluloderma. Species in this section have pleurocystidia that are either absent or non-. Furthermore, the majority have a cap cuticle comprising short club-shaped or spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem) cells, {{that may or may}} not be mixed with elongated cystidia-like cells. Other species in Celluloderma include P.romellii, P.aurantiorugosus, P.pulverulentus, P.thompsonii, and P.horakianus. Molecular analyses of <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> DNA sequences supports the placement of P.nevadensis in Celluloderma, and further suggest that it has a sister relationship with P.horakianas. The specific epithet nevadensis refers to the mountain, Nevado de Colima, where the type material was collected.|$|E

5|$|Other species {{names such}} as Cicuta bolanderi, Cicuta californica, and Cicuta curtissii are older names now {{recognized}} to be varieties of the widespread, morphologically variable Cicuta maculata. Cicuta maculata is now recognized to have four varieties: var. maculata, var. augustifolia, var. victorinii, and var. bolanderi. Phylogenetic analysis using the sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> (ITS) loci was not conclusive but seems to show that C.bulbifera and C.virosa are monophyletic, while C.douglasii may not be. It was also suggested a specimen from California may warrant recognition as a distinct species.

5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of large subunit and <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> DNA sequence data, {{the results of}} which were published in 2012, concluded that the species then known as F.ellipsoidea was closely related to Phellinus gabonensis, P.caribaeo-quercicolus and the newly described P.castanopsidis. The four species share morphological characteristics, and form a monophyletic clade. This clade resolved more closely with the Phellinus type species P.igniarius than it did with the Fomitiporia type species F.langloisii, and so the authors proposed a transference of F.ellipsoidea to Phellinus, naming the new combination Phellinus ellipsoideus. While the taxonomic database Index Fungorum follows the 2012 study, MycoBank continues to list Fomitiporia ellipsoidea as the correct binomial. Some mycologists consider Fomitiporia to be a synonym of Phellinus anyway.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} in {{the literature}} about whether Suillus cothurnatus represents a different species from S.salmonicolor. The online mycological taxonomy database MycoBank lists them as synonyms, contrary to Index Fungorum.

In a molecular analyses of Suillus phylogeny, based on the <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer,</b> S.salmonicolor (as S.subluteus) and S.intermedius clustered together very closely, indicating a high degree of genetic similarity.

5|$|Rolf Singer's fourth edition (1986) of his {{comprehensive}} Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy included Collybia racemosa {{in section}} Collybia, {{in addition to}} the three species that currently comprise the genus Collybia: C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei. A phylogenetic analysis of the <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> sequences of ribosomal DNA by Karen Hughes and colleagues showed that C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei form a monophyletic group within a larger Lyophyllum–Tricholoma–Collybia clade that includes several species of Lyophyllum, Tricholoma, Lepista, Hypsizygus and the species C.racemosa. Hughes and colleagues could not identify a clade that included all four species of Collybia. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the ribosomal DNA from the four species corroborated the results obtained from phylogenetic analysis. Based on these results, as well as differences in characteristics such as the presence of unique stem projections, fruit body pigmentation, and macrochemical reactions, they circumscribed the new genus Dendrocollybia to contain C.racemosa.|$|E
5|$|Within Xeromphalina, X.setulipes {{is part of}} {{the section}} Mutabiles, which also {{contains}} X.campanelloides, X.cauticinalis, X.cirris, X.cornui, and X.fraxinophila. Phylogenetic analysis performed by Esteve-Raventós and colleagues concluded that X.setulipes appears to be most closely related to X.fraxinophila, X.cornui, X.campanelloides and X.cauticinalis, the five of which are clearly separate from the group containing X.campanella, X.kauffmanii, X.brunneola, and, possibly, X.junipericola. Data from the large subunit (60S) of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene suggests that the species is most closely related to X.campanelloides, while <b>internal</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>spacer</b> (ITS) data place it closest to a clade containing X.cauticinalis and X.aff.parvibulbosa (an unidentified species similar, but not identical, to X.parvibulbosa).
