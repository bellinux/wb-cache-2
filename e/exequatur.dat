25|$|In 1921, Sousa Mendes was {{assigned}} to the Portuguese consulate in San Francisco, and two more of his children were born there. In 1923, he angered some members of the Portuguese-American community because of his insistence that certain applicants contribute to a Portuguese charity. Both sides decided to publish their arguments in local newspapers. Ultimately the conflict led to the US Department of State canceling his consular <b>exequatur</b> which prevented him from continuing his consular services in the US. While in San Francisco, Sousa Mendes helped establish a Portuguese Studies program at the University of California at Berkeley.|$|E

60|$|An <b>exequatur</b> bearing {{date the}} 3d day of May, 1858, having been issued to Charles Hunt, {{a citizen of}} the United States, {{recognizing}} him as a Consul of Belgium for St. Louis, Missouri, and declaring him free to exercise and enjoy such functions, powers, and privileges as are allowed to the Consuls of the most favored nations in the United States, and the said Hunt having sought to screen himself from his military duty to his country, in consequence of thus being invested with the consular functions of a foreign power in the United States, it is deemed advisable that the said Charles Hunt should no longer be permitted to continue in the exercise of said functions, powers, and privileges.|$|E
60|$|As to the blockade, {{you will}} say that by [the] our own laws [of nature] {{and the laws of}} nature and the laws of nations, this Government has a clear right to {{suppress}} insurrection. An exclusion of commerce from national ports which have been seized by the insurgents, in the equitable form of blockade, is the proper means to that end. You will [admit] not insist that our blockade is [not] to be respected if it be not maintained by a competent force; but passing by that question as not now a practical, or at least an urgent, one, you will add that [it] the blockade is now, and it will continue to be so maintained, and therefore we expect it to be respected by Great Britain. You will add that we have already revoked the <b>exequatur</b> of a Russian consul who had enlisted in the military service of the insurgents, and we shall dismiss or demand the recall of every foreign agent, consular or diplomatic, who shall either disobey the Federal laws or disown the Federal authority.|$|E

40|$|Theodore Balsamon, a 12 th-century Constantinopolitan canonist, famously said: “Civil law punishes, {{canon law}} heals”. This paper tries to {{understand}} that statement by studying the relationship between civil law and canon law in the Eastern Orthodox tradition. From the 4 th century onwards, the Roman imperial administration gave <b>exequaturs</b> to episcopal judicial decisions. In his novellae, Emperor Justinian considered the canons of the ecumenical councils as nomoi, which also implied that he could change canons by enacting imperial legislation. As of the 6 th century, canon and imperial laws were published together in so-called nomokanones. At {{the end of the}} 9 th century, Patriarch Photios formulated – for the first and last time in Byzantine legal history – the division of competences between Emperor and Patriarch. This paper argues that, though civil and canon law were separate fields with their own specific aims, the executability of their sentences remained crucially different. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The Brussels I Regulation’s re-foundation by the New Brussels I Regulation {{was thought}} to secure {{reciprocal}} trust on justice administration among Member States and to grant full access to justice for those who inhabit and circulate in its territory. In a Union characterized by circulation freedoms and an internal market existence, those principles justify {{a situation in which}} judgments ruled by a Member State’s court are automatically recognised and enforced, in other Member-State, except when the defendant evokes the rules on denial of judgments’ recognition and enforcement. There would not be judicial cooperation and integration’s prosecution without trust – trust must exist among Member States’ courts and it must be felt by EU citizens so they can acknowledge that EU is actively seeking to improve their life and working conditions. The European Commission made constructive efforts to promote an <b>exequatur’s</b> abolition, making recognition and enforcement proceedings on the New Brussels I Regulation simpler (it even proposed to remove the “public policy” clause, which was not accepted). It is necessary to analyse how the CJEU applies the rules on denial of judgments’ recognition and enforcement to perceive if the principle of an effective judicial protection is fulfilled under New Brussels I Regulation. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
60|$|We {{had decided}} to visit London, where the season, or winter, would soon commence. The {{necessary}} arrangements were made, and we sent round our cards of p.p.c. and obtained passports. On the very day we were to quit Paris, an American friend wrote me a note {{to say that a}} young connexion of his was desirous of going to London, and begged a place for her in my carriage. It is, I believe, a peculiar and a respectable trait in the national character, that we so seldom hesitate about asking, or acceding to, favours of this sort. Whenever woman is concerned, our own sex yield, and usually without murmuring. At all events, it was so with W----, who cheerfully gave up his seat in the carriage to Miss ----, in order to take one in the coupé of the diligence. The notice was so short, and the hour so late, that {{there was no time to}} get a passport for him, and, as he was included in mine, I was compelled to run the risk of sending him to the frontiers without one. I was a consul at the time,--a titular one as to duties, but in reality as much of a consul as if I had ever visited my consulate.[34] The only official paper I possessed, in connexion with the office, the commission and <b>exequatur</b> excepted, was a letter from the Préfet of the Rhône, acknowledging the receipt of the latter. As this was strictly a French document, I gave it to W---- as proof of my identity, accompanied by a brief statement of the reasons why he was without a passport, begging the authorities at Need to let him pass as far as the frontier, where I should be in season to prove his character. This statement I signed as consul, instructing W---- to show it, if applied to for a passport; and if the gendarmes disavowed me, to show the letter, by way of proving who I was. The expedient was clumsy enough, but it was the best that offered.|$|E
