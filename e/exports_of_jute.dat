40|$|Jute {{is popular}} {{for its ability}} to use in various forms in {{packaging}} and handicraft industry. The industry contributes greatly in the country’s economy and has potential to propel the economy in coming years. Jute Textile Industry {{is one of the major}} Industries in the Eastern India, particularly in West Bengal. Jute supports around 40 Lakh farm families and provides direct employment to 2. 6 Lakh Industrial Workers and 1. 4 Lakh in the tertiary sector. The production process in the Jute Industry goes through a variety of activities, which include cultivation <b>of</b> raw <b>jute,</b> processing <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fibres, spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, finishing and marketing of both, the raw jute and its finished products. So, Jute Industry is labour intensive and as such its labour-output ratio is also high in spite of various difficulties being faced by the industry. Capacity utilization of the industry is around 75 per cent. Jute industry contributes to the export earnings in the range of Rs. 1, 000 to Rs. 1, 200 crore annually. The paper is an attempt to highlight production & <b>export</b> performance <b>of</b> Indian <b>jute</b> industry in India as well as highlighting the <b>export</b> scenario <b>of</b> Indian <b>jute</b> production in recent years.

40|$|Up {{until the}} First World War a number <b>of</b> staple <b>exports</b> formed {{the core of}} Britain’s {{industrial}} economy, employing a large workforce and developing the towns and cities associated with them. While the nineteenth century saw the rapid expansion <b>of</b> these <b>export</b> industries, the twentieth century was marked by their extensive decline. Jute was one industry that experienced such a contraction. As the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> processed <b>jute</b> declined, both the employers and the government faced the problem of managing this descent. Located almost entirely in and around Dundee, jute provides a valuable case study of a local industry but also an important insight into Britain’s managed economy. By looking at jute as the forerunner of decline this study assesses the successes and failures of these efforts. It also addresses broader arguments about {{the political economy of}} twentieth-century Britain...|$|R

The first {{failure was}} internal: the specific {{configuration of the}} state rationing system and the market resulted in speculative hoarding by farmers and traders and a consequent rise in prices. [...] The second failure was external: the US had withheld 2.2 million tonnes of food aid, as the then US Ambassador to Bangladesh made it abundantly clear that the US probably could not commit food aid because of Bangladesh's policy <b>of</b> <b>exporting</b> <b>jute</b> to Cuba. And by the time Bangladesh succumbed to the American pressure, and stopped jute exports to Cuba, the food aid in transit was [...] "too late for famine victims".|$|R
2500|$|During {{the years}} between 1960 and 1965, the annual {{rate of growth of}} the gross {{domestic}} product per capita was 4.4% in West Pakistan versus just 2.6% in East Pakistan. Furthermore, Bengali politicians pushing for more autonomy complained that much <b>of</b> Pakistan's <b>export</b> earnings were generated in East Pakistan by the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> Bengali <b>jute</b> and tea. As late as 1960, approximately 70% <b>of</b> Pakistan's <b>export</b> earnings originated in the East Wing, although this percentage declined as international demand for jute dwindled. By the mid-1960s, the East Wing was accounting for less than 60% <b>of</b> the nation's <b>export</b> earnings, and by the time of Bangladesh's independence in 1971, this percentage had dipped below 50%. Mujib demanded in 1966 that separate foreign exchange accounts be kept and that separate trade offices be opened overseas. By the mid-1960s, West Pakistan was benefiting from Ayub's [...] "Decade of Progress," [...] with its successful [...] "green revolution" [...] in wheat, and from the expansion of markets for West Pakistani textiles, while the East Pakistani standard of living remained at an abysmally low level.

The detailed study has demonstrated the twofold effect <b>of</b> chitosan on <b>jute</b> fiber. The treatment <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> with chitosan can appreciably enhance the uptake of dye by the fiber. Moreover, the color fastness property of dyed fabrics against washing and rubbing also exhibits within the acceptable range of good to excellent. On the other hand, the antimicrobial activities <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fabric increase significantly due to the combined effect of natural dye henna and biopolymer chitosan.
