40|$|It is {{increasingly}} recognised that agricultural {{growth and development}} do not necessarily translate into improved nutrition outcomes. Policymakers are increasingly grappling with how to design and implement agricultural policies and programmes that can also achieve nutritional objectives. Agriculture has direct links to nutrition in that it provides a source of food and nutrients and a broad-based source of income, as well as directly influencing food prices. Gender roles mediate these linkages, particularly in relation to increased food availability and increased income. Thus, one possible pathway through which agricultural development could improve health and nutrition outcomes is by considering gender roles and gender equity in agriculture.

40|$|Speech {{recognition}} involves three processes: {{extraction of}} acoustic indices from the speech signal, {{estimation of the}} probability that the observed index string was caused by a hypothesized utterance segment, and determination of the recognized utterance via a search among hypothesized alternatives. This paper is not concerned with the first process. Estimation of the probability of an index string involves a model of <b>index</b> <b>production</b> by any given utterance segment (e. g., a word). Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used for this purpose [Makhoul, J. & Schwartz, R. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92, 9956 - 9963]. Their parameters are state transition probabilities and output probability distributions associated with the transitions. The Baum algorithm that obtains the values of these parameters from speech data via their successive reestimation will be described in this paper. The recognizer wishes to find the most probable utterance that could have caused the observed acoustic index string. That probability is the product of two factors: {{the probability that the}} utterance will produce the string and the probability that the speaker will wish to produce the utterance (the language model probability). Even if the vocabulary size is moderate, it is impossible to search for the utterance exhaustively. One practical algorithm is described [Viterbi, A. J. (1967) IEEE Trans. Inf.

In the absence of sulfur, leaves are chlorotic with pale veins.

O delineamento experimental foi o de blocos casualizados com testemunhas pareadas, com cinco tratamentos e quatro repetições, existindo uma testemunha capinada para cada tratamento químico dentro de cada bloco. Os tratamentos foram: diuron+hexazinone (1. 170 + 330 g ha- 1), azafenidin+ hexazinone (192, 5 + 247, 5 g ha- 1), metribuzin (1. 920 g ha- 1), isoxaflutole (127, 5 g ha¹) e testemunha capinada.

Effect of the chemical hydrogen cyanamide (CH 2 N 2) on the thinning of flowers and fruits of the peach cultivar Coral was assessed in this study. Treatments consisted of five doses of CH 2 N 2 (0, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, and 0. 8 %) spray application {{to the point of}} run-off, at two stages (50 % and 100 % flowering). The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with six replicates and one plant per plot. The following parameters were assessed: percentage of flowers thinned at 25 days after spraying, percentage of fruits thinned, fruiting <b>index,</b> <b>production</b> per plant, fruit mass, diameter and length, flesh firmness, soluble solids (SS) and titratable acidity (TA). Concentrations of 0. 6 and 0. 8 % CH 2 N 2 application at 50 % flowering resulted in thinning 84. 4 and 84. 7 % of the flowers and 0. 4 % CH 2 N 2 at 100 % flowering thinned 87. 3 %, values close to index assessed in manual thinning (88. 0 %) experiments. The highest production per plant was recorded for treatments with CH 2 N 2 application at 50 % flowering, resulting from a high percentage of flowers opening after spraying the chemical thinner. As such, flowers opening late were not affected by the chemical, thereby ensuring a higher fruiting index. Peach yield with 50 % CH 2 N 2 was not significantly different from yield observed for manual treatment, and 0. 6 % spray was reported to be the optimal dosage. Treatment with 0. 6 % CH 2 N 2 application at 50 % flowering was not significantly qualitatively different from manual thinning. CH 2 N 2 application is efficient for the thinning of ‘Coral’ peach flowers and fruits...|$|E

Moves large sums of money, the dairy industry employs millions of the people, having potential to provide the domestic and foreign markets. Besides surpassing year by year the <b>index</b> <b>production.</b> The quality of milk is increasingly demanded by consumers and there are bonus programs for milk with low somatic cell counts, which reveal, indirectely, the udder sanity. Mastitis, the udder inflamation, is the main factor that substantially compromises the milk quality. Several methods can diagnose the incidence of subclinical mastitis in dairy herds. One these methods, the California Mastitis Test (CMT) has as advantages being practical, low cost and the results are immediately available. The CMT method consists of adding the anionic neutral detergent to a milk sample in order to disrupt milk somatic cell membranes and release nucleic material. The viscousity formed by this reaction allows estimating the number of somatic cells (immunity cells) presents in the milk. According to the degree of gelatinization obtained in this reaction, the interpretation of the scores varies from zero, no viscosity, to three crosses, highly viscous. This study was aimed to evaluate the CMT of eight dairy herds of different farms in Sao Paulo state, described by the letters A to H. The scores 1, 2 and 3 were considered positive for subclinical mastitis, while 0 was negative. The results were determined in relative frequency (%). It is evident that the herd D is the most affected by subclinical mastitis, because of the greater number of CMT positive (60 %). This may be due to the mismanagement and poor conditions of milking. The properties C, F and G require greater attention, as the result of CMT could corroborate the presence of pathogenic microorganisms and infected cows can quickly transmit the infection to the healthy ones. Note that the farms A, B and H are the ones with the largest number of CMT negative, that is, with cows with better conditions of udder sanity. Over all it is found that CMT consists of an effective test for the detection of subclinical mastitis. </p...|$|E
