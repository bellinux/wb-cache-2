5|$|The {{potential}} to <b>draw</b> <b>an</b> MLS expansion team helped drive {{public support for}} building the stadium in 1997. In 1996, Seattle was considered {{for one of the}} 10 original MLS teams; however, the region lacked an adequate outdoor stadium. In 2007, it was announced that Seattle would be the home of an expansion team. The first Sounders FC regular season match was at the stadium on March 19, 2009. Fredy Montero scored the first goal in a 3–0 Seattle victory.|$|E
5|$|The European Championship final is {{the last}} match of the competition, and the result determines which country's team is {{declared}} European champion. As of the 2016 tournament, if after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a <b>draw,</b> <b>an</b> additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time, it is decided by penalty shoot-out. The team that wins the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions. The 15 finals to-date have produced five drawn matches, the eventual winners {{of which have been}} determined variously by replay (1968), extra time (1960, 2016), penalty shoot-out (1976) or golden goal (1996, 2000). The winners are awarded a replica of the trophy (the original remains with UEFA), while the losing finalists and semi-finalists are presented with a plaque. Gold and silver medals are awarded to the players of the winning and losing finalists respectively.|$|E
5|$|The World Cup final {{match is}} the last of the competition, and the result determines which country is {{declared}} world champions. If after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a <b>draw,</b> <b>an</b> additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time it is decided by kicks from the penalty shoot-out. The team winning the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions. The tournament has been decided by a one-off match on every occasion except 1950, when the tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group contested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). Uruguay's 2–1 victory over Brazil was the decisive match (and one of the last two matches of the tournament) which put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished top of the group as world champions. Therefore, this match is regarded by FIFA as the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the prizes}} {{are exactly the}} same, it follows that you will prefer Gamble A to Gamble B {{if and only if}} you believe that <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red ball is more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black ball (according to {{expected}} utility theory). Also, there would be no clear preference between the choices if you thought that a red ball was as likely as a black ball. Similarly it follows that you will prefer Gamble C to Gamble D if, and only if, you believe that <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red or yellow ball is more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black or yellow ball. It might seem intuitive that, if <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red ball is more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black ball, then <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red or yellow ball is also more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black or yellow ball. So, supposing you prefer Gamble A to Gamble B, it follows that you will also prefer Gamble C to Gamble D. And, supposing instead that you prefer Gamble B to Gamble A, it follows that you will also prefer Gamble D to Gamble C.|$|R

In this case the angle sum formula simplifies to 180°, which we know is what Euclidean geometry tells us for triangles on a flat surface.|$|E

25|$|To <b>draw</b> <b>an</b> {{algebraic}} curve, it {{is important}} to know the remarkable points and their tangents, the infinite branches and their asymptotes (if any) and the way in which the arcs connect them. It is also useful to consider the inflection points as remarkable points. When all this information is drawn on a sheet of paper, the shape of the curve usually appears rather clearly. If not, it suffices to add a few other points and their tangents to get a good description of the curve.|$|E
25|$|As {{a way of}} {{visualizing}} {{the choice}} of a gauge, consider whether it is possible to tell if a cylinder has been twisted. If the cylinder has no bumps, marks, or scratches on it, we cannot tell. We could, however, <b>draw</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary curve along the cylinder, defined by some function θ(x), where x measures distance along the axis of the cylinder. Once this arbitrary choice (the choice of gauge) has been made, it becomes possible to detect it if someone later twists the cylinder.|$|E
25|$|The first Test {{was held}} at the SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff, the first Test match ever to be held at the ground, and {{resulted}} in England saving a draw with one wicket to spare, and Ricky Ponting surpassing 11,000 Test runs, becoming Australia's leading Test run scorer as the series progressed. The second Test at Lord's was preceded by the announcement that Andrew Flintoff would be retiring from Test cricket {{at the end of the}} series. The England all-rounder then took his first Lord's five-for to seal a 115-run victory, England's first against Australia at the ground in 75 years. Rain prevented play for large amounts of the Third Test at Edgbaston, including the entire third day, making the <b>draw</b> <b>an</b> inevitable result. Australia pegged the score back to 1–1 with an innings victory at Headingley after bowling out England for 102, their lowest Ashes total since they were bowled out for 77 at Lord's in 1997. This left the Fifth Test at The Oval to decide the series.|$|E
50|$|If two {{cards are}} drawn with {{replacement}} from {{a deck of}} cards, the event of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the first trial and that of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the second trial are independent. By contrast, if two cards are drawn without replacement from a deck of cards, the event of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the first trial and that of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the second trial are not independent, because a deck that has had a red card removed has proportionately fewer red cards.|$|R
50|$|For example, it is {{impossible}} to <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> card that is both red and a club because clubs are always black. If just one card is drawn from the deck, either a red card (heart or diamond) or a black card (club or spade) will be <b>drawn.</b> When <b>A</b> and B are mutually exclusive, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B). To find the probability of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card or a club, for example, add together the probability of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card and the probability of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> club. In a standard 52-card deck, there are twenty-six red cards and thirteen clubs: 26/52 + 13/52 = 39/52 or 3/4.|$|R

25|$|Fatio {{assumed that}} the {{universe}} is filled with minute particles, which are moving indiscriminately with very high speed and rectilinearly in all directions. To illustrate his thoughts he used the following example: Suppose an object C, on which an infinite small plane zz and a sphere centered about zz is drawn. Into this sphere Fatio placed the pyramid PzzQ, in which some particles are streaming in the direction of zz and also some particles, which were already reflected by C and therefore depart from zz. Fatio proposed that the mean velocity of the reflected particles is lower and therefore their momentum is weaker than that of the incident particles. The result is one stream, which pushes all bodies in the direction of zz. So on one hand the speed of the stream remains constant, {{but on the other hand}} at larger proximity to zz the density of the stream increases and therefore its intensity is proportional to 1/r2. And because one can <b>draw</b> <b>an</b> infinite number of such pyramids around C, the proportionality applies to the entire range around C.|$|E
