500|$|The {{illustrated}} book of The Hockey Sweater {{was among}} the children's books included as official Canadian gifts presented to the Prince of Wales and his family during an official visit in 1991, for his then nine-year-old son William. Canadian astronaut Robert Thirsk, {{as part of a}} personal tradition of honouring others, brought a copy of the story to space when he travelled to the International Space Station in 2009 and later presented the copy to Carrier.

[...] "After Dark" [...] was co-written by Dennis, who had previously co-written [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] for Minogue. Torrini, who co-wrote [...] "Slow", revealed how she was approached for writing the song, saying [...] "It was like I had just accidentally walked into the line of fire with, [...] "Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number. It'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened".

2500|$|More than 100 {{people took}} to the streets in San Francisco on October 28 to protest the show and demand [...] "a more {{elaborate}} apology" [...] and that Kimmel to be fired. On that day's broadcast, Kimmel addressed the controversy personally, saying: [...] "I thought it was obvious that I didn't agree with that statement, but apparently it wasn't … So <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> I'm sorry, I apologize.” Despite the apologies from ABC and Kimmel, protests continued. A White House petition was created to investigate this incident and reached the 100,000 signatures needed to require a response from the White House. The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus denounced the incident and demanded a formal apology from ABC.|$|E
2500|$|At a February 2014 {{listening}} {{session for}} the album, Schoolboy Q {{spoke on the}} album's opening track: [...] "When I first made [...] all I wanted to say was that my grandma showed me my first strap. That's all I wanted {{to put in the}} song. I just thought that was so gangsta. It was kind of weird, too, now that I really think about it. She used to take her bullets out of the gun and leave the clip in her room and let me play with her gun. I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.' Like, 'Your dickies is cut super perfect and they got the right amount of dirt on them. That shit is fly." ...|$|E

6000|$|He went on. [...] "Oh, you needn't be afraid. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, that's all. If {{there was}} only some other way to {{straighten}} myself--but I can't go to jail. I can't stand up to be clipped like a poodle-dog, then put on striped clothing and walk lock-step--I can't do it! They'll put me in for ten years. I'd be old when I got out." [...] He shuddered. [...] "No, I won't do that! I'd rather die here in the hills." ...|$|E
6000|$|Polly {{was very}} quiet after that, and the minute dinner was over, {{she left the room}} to go and have a quiet [...] "think" [...] about the whole matter. Before she got half-way up stairs, she saw Tom coming after, and {{immediately}} sat down to guard her feet. He laughed, and said, as he perched himself on the post of the banisters, [...] "I won't grab you, honor bright. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> if you 'll come out to-morrow some time, we 'll have a good coast." ...|$|E

I wish I could get over feeling like a sophomore talking to a dean, and then I could tell you I hadn't {{supposed}} there was anybody could talk to me {{the way you have}} and get away with it. I'd always thought I'd punch their head off, and here you've had me completely buffaloed. It's wonderful! Honestly, it never struck me till just this second that there isn't any law that compels me to sit here and take all this. You had me completely hypnotized." ...|$|E

5000|$|Looking {{back at her}} {{political}} life, Humphrey reflected [...] "There's something I've been wanting to say for a long time. I'm a liberal and I'm proud of it. In fact, I was probably a little more liberal than Hubert was. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that." [...] While in office, and after, she pressed for the right for women to choose {{to have an abortion}} and worked towards legislation for the rights of the mentally disabled.|$|E
5000|$|Yo, so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a {{few things}} about John Cardiel. First off, he's an {{original}}; his style—there's not too many people who skate like him. The way he skates is amazing, 'cause he'll skate so fast, but it seems like the faster he goes, the more control he has ... which is, you know, unexplainable. But he's unbelievable. I'm not trying to kiss too much butt, but he's a ripper, an original ripper ... He's an original Coors.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the same}} interview, he {{explained}} the song [...] "Fuck Seaworld", saying: [...] "Well, “Fuck Seaworld” actually came from me watching the documentary Blackfish. It’s a documentary about SeaWorld and the mistreatment of the whales and dolphins and the abuse. It’s like these whales are highly intelligent creatures with huge brains and social systems that they’re used to. They’re used to being in families of 10 or more and they’re used to communicating vocally. They’re very smart, intelligent animals, and Seaworld keeps them in these little pools {{the size of a}} bathtub to us. These are huge animals that are used to swimming more than 100 miles per day and they’re in this little bathtub, and it’s like, “What the fuck?” Blackfish kind of pointed out that this is barbaric and it’s super old school. I’m surprised that we still do this and people are still entertained by having these huge whales clap and do a backflip in a pool for a couple fish. It’s kind of just fucked up, and I watched that and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something. I was fired up about it and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something man. Laughs. And that’s what happened." ...|$|E

5000|$|Marks {{once said}} that he started {{creating}} aboriginal-themed television shows to counter the negative perceptions of aboriginals {{in the mainstream media}} during his youth. He said, [...] "All you ever saw about Indians back then was either a political confrontation, Main Street's socio-economic problems or the buckskin-and-beads powwow stuff. Nobody was doing stories about contemporary aboriginal people who were contributing to society. I was out there, seeing so many positive things, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'Hey, wait a minute. Don't judge everybody by Main Street'."
