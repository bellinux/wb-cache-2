Three different frequency hopping techniques are exploited to increase data rate and coverage: random frequency hopping (RFH), dynamic frequency hopping (DFH) and a novel system, dynamic frequency hopping with limited information (DFH-LI), which is proposed in this thesis. The performance (average user spectral efficiencies, outage probability and average poor frequency hop ratios {{over the whole}} frequency <b>hop</b> <b>pattern</b> of a user, which {{is a measure of}} the quality of the frequency <b>hop</b> <b>pattern</b> of a user) of these different CRN systems are compared with conventional cellular networks (CCN) as the single-hop reference system.

40|$|Abstract. We discuss ways {{to enhance}} the {{location}} privacy of Bluetooth. The principal weakness of Bluetooth with respect to location privacy lies in its disclosure of a device’s permanent identifier, which makes location tracking easy. Bluetooth’s permanent identifier is often disclosed {{and it is also}} tightly integrated into lower layers of the Bluetooth stack, and hence susceptible to leakage. We survey known location privacy attacks against Bluetooth, generalize a lesser-known attack, and describe and quantify a more novel attack. The second of these attacks, which recovers a 28 -bit identifier via the device’s frequency <b>hop</b> <b>pattern,</b> requires just a few packets and is practicable. Based on a realistic usage scenario, we develop an enhanced privacy framework with stronger unlinkability, using protected stateful pseudonyms and simple primitives...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of multilevel frequency-shift keying/frequency-hopping spread-spectrum multiple access (MFSK/FH-SSMA) to wireless systems has been receiving attention recently. Most studies on MFSK/FH-SSMA wireless systems so far assume to support only {{one type of}} medium, A flexible support of multimedia services in future wireless systems is expected. However, the use of conventional "fixed-length" FH patterns alone cannot serve these multirate multimedia wireless systems. In this paper, a family of double-length fixed-weight generalized prime <b>hopping</b> <b>patterns</b> is reviewed. These FH patterns have cross correlations of no greater than one {{in order to minimize}} mutual interference and are well suited for wireless systems with double-media services. The performances of the prime <b>hopping</b> <b>patterns</b> and conventional random <b>hopping</b> <b>patterns</b> in MFSK/FH-SSMA wireless systems over Rayleigh fading and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels are analyzed and compared for one type of medium first and extended to two types of media.

40|$|A {{statistical}} multiplexing scheme in orthogonal downlinks is proposed to accommodate more downlink orthogonal channels than orthogonal codewords for mobile stations. The number of allocable downlink orthogonal channels {{depends on the}} average burstiness of the channels. The {{statistical multiplexing}} scheme is called here as the orthogonal code hopping multiplexing (OCHM). Since the OCHM uses a pre-allocated independent <b>hopping</b> <b>pattern</b> for each mobile station (MS), the number of transactions for channel allocation and de-allocation can be smaller than the conventional downlink orthogonal multiplexing scheme. Since the number of available codewords in orthogonal code for OCHM is limited (for cdmaOne, it is 64) and the <b>hopping</b> <b>patterns</b> are mutually independent, the <b>hopping</b> <b>patterns</b> for two or more synchronous downlink channels may collide.

40|$|Abstract—The {{capacity}} of a fast frequency-hopped multiple access (FHMA) system is dictated by two major related design concerns: the <b>hopping</b> <b>pattern</b> and the receiver structure. This paper studies {{the impact of these}} two factors. We present a maximum likelihood (ML) diversity combiner for detecting asyn-chronous FHMA multilevel FSK (MFSK) signals in Rician fading channels and analyze the performance of a close approximation of the ML receiver. We compare systems using random <b>hopping</b> <b>patterns</b> and those using optimal <b>hopping</b> <b>patterns</b> of Einarsson [8]. Performance comparisons between chip-synchronous and chip-asynchronous systems are made as well. We propose and ex-amine the effectiveness of a two-stage multiuser detector, in which the first stage makes an initial decision while the second stage tries to reduce multiple access interference (MAI) and resolve the ambiguity left by the first stage detector. The MAI caused by undesired users is constituted by a cochannel interference (CCI) contribution and an interchannel interference (ICI) contribution. This detector is of modest complexity and is capable of removing most of the CCI and part of the ICI. Two methods for mitigating MAI are also examined.

30|$|The main {{contributions}} {{of this paper}} are as follows: (1) presenting the virtual user equivalent to simplify the MAI model, which converts the uncertain of the <b>hopping</b> <b>patterns</b> of the interfering users to the uncertain of the signals of the virtual user and (2) proposing a joint interference reconstruction and multiple-user detection (MUD) algorithm using the factor graph framework. Since the pseudo-random <b>hopping</b> <b>patterns</b> are unknown except by the desired user, the received symbols of the desired user may be interfered in some partial hops by the symbols of other users, which are defined as interfering fragments in this paper. Although symbols in interfering fragments belong to different users, they all appear {{at the same time}} and frequency as the desired user. By splicing the interference fragments of the interfering users hop by hop, a virtual user with the same <b>hopping</b> <b>patterns</b> as that of the desired user is defined. Thus, the MAI can be expressed as a simple interference model between the desired user and the virtual user. According to the simplified MAI model, we propose an iterative detection algorithm with joint interference reconstruction and cancellation without the knowledge of <b>hopping</b> <b>patterns</b> of the interfering users for SFH/BPSK systems. By formulating a factor graph to represent the SFH/BPSK systems, symbols of the desired user and the virtual user and the structure of the virtual user can be estimated jointly through several iterations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of the SUD, PH-MUD, and erasure detection (ED). Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a better performance compared with other classic methods, and an outstanding performance can also be achieved in the channel with Doppler.|$|R

30|$|We {{consider}} a coded frequency hopping system with K users and N frequencies {{in an ad}} hoc communication network. For each user, information bits b are encoded and interleaved into an L-bit packet c. Finally, each packet is divided into D segments with the same length. Each segment with P/ 2 pilots inserted {{at each of the}} front and the end sides is transmitted as a hop in different frequencies according to the pseudo random <b>hopping</b> <b>pattern,</b> which is unique for each user. As the <b>hopping</b> <b>patterns</b> are non-orthogonal, MAI occurs whenever more than one user transmits in the same frequency at the same time. In asynchronous frequency hopping systems, interference may only appear partly in one hop of the desired user, while in synchronous frequency hopping systems, the signals of the interfering users affect that of the desired user in one whole hop.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} enhance system {{throughput}} and spectral efficiency, frequency hopping (FH) is generally used in OFDMA cellular systems. It is desirable for FH patterns {{to satisfy the}} following conditions [2]: (i) minimize intracell interference; (ii) average intercell interference; (iii) avoid ambiguity while identifying users; (iv) exploit frequency diversity by forcing hops to span a large bandwidth. The first aspect {{is relatively easy to}} achieve by using orthogonal <b>hopping</b> <b>patterns</b> within a cell. To average intercell interferences, <b>hopping</b> <b>patterns</b> are constructed in a way that two users in different cells interfere with each other only during a small fraction of all hops.

Although the PH-MUD can work well for synchronous frequency hopping systems, it may revert to PH-SUD without {{the knowledge of the}} <b>hopping</b> <b>patterns</b> and pilot signals of the interfering users.

Both OCHM and MSC have been proposed in order to overcome a code-limitation problem in CDMA downlink. However, both schemes exhibit different characteristics. In order to increase user capacity in CDMA downlink, OCHM allocates a random <b>hopping</b> <b>pattern</b> using a set of orthogonal codes instead of orthogonal code for each connection and MSC allocates a non-orthogonal codeword to each connection. In the OCHM scheme, <b>hopping</b> <b>pattern</b> (HP) collisions may degrade the system performance. The HP collisions in OCHM systems differ from the hits in frequencyhopping (FH) systems because it can be effectively controlled through synergy and perforation techniques. In OCHM, the receiver requires additional energy for a given frame error rate (FER) due to the HP collision.
