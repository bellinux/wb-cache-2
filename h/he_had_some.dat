5|$|A merchant, José Ignacio Rezábal, {{attended}} the open cabildo but, {{in a letter}} to the priest Julián S. de Agüero, said that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> doubts which were shared by other people close to him. He feared that, no matter which party prevailed in the open cabildo, it would take revenge against the other, the Mutiny of Álzaga being a recent precedent. He felt that the open cabildo would lack legitimacy if too many criollos were allowed to take part in it as a result of the aforementioned manipulation of the guest list.|$|E
5|$|After {{qualifying}} as a barrister, {{he moved}} to Birmingham in 1914, choosing the city because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> connections there thanks to his association with Cadbury, and began work at the chambers of John Hurst. His career was aided by the outbreak of World War I; many of the younger and fitter barristers were called up for war service, whilst Birkett himself, who was thirty {{when he joined the}} bar, avoided conscription as he was declared medically unfit. He was suffering from tuberculosis, and he returned to Ulverston for six months to recover. During his time in Birmingham, he continued his work as a minister, regularly preaching at the Baptist People's Chapel.|$|E
5|$|After the victory, a {{prize crew}} was put aboard Chesapeake. The {{commander}} of the prize, Lieutenant Falkiner, had {{a good deal of}} trouble from the restive Americans, who outnumbered his own men. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> {{of the leaders of the}} unrest transferred to Shannon in the leg-irons that had, ironically, been shipped aboard Chesapeake to deal with expected British prisoners. The rest of the American crew were rendered docile by the expedient of a carpenter cutting scuttles (holes) in the maindeck through which two 18-pounder cannon, loaded with grapeshot, were pointed at them.|$|E

5|$|Americus (foaled 1892, died 1910), was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who was {{exported}} to England. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> {{success as a}} racehorse, but was more notable for his influence at stud. He was bred in California and won the 1895 Culver Stakes prior to his export. He continued to race in England, until he was nine years old, while also standing as a breeding stallion. He stood at stud in Italy, Ireland, Germany, and Belgium before dying in Germany in 1910. Americus' most famous descendant was his great-granddaughter Mumtaz Mahal.|$|E
5|$|Godley was {{a colonel}} and {{serving on the}} staff of 2nd Division when, in 1910, he {{accepted}} the position of Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces, as the New Zealand Army was then known. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> reservations about his new appointment; he had been in line for command of an infantry brigade and was concerned that being posted to remote New Zealand would be detrimental to his career. He arrived in New Zealand to take up his duties in December 1910.|$|E

Posted to the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, he served in Egypt and on the Western Front. As a company commander in his battalion, he participated in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette during the Somme Offensive in September 1916. He was awarded the Military Cross for his part in the battle, after which he was the only surviving officer from his section of the front line.|$|E

Groves was appalled at the work practices and safety at Site S, and considered it {{only a matter of time}} before it blew up. On Parsons' recommendation, Groves decided to establish a pilot plant at NOTS, because Caltech had experience in building and operating pilot ordnance plants. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> misgivings about this, because he thought that the Navy might err too far on the side of workplace safety.|$|E
5|$|After delays, {{the voyage}} began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin {{spent most of}} that time on land {{investigating}} geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts. He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of his journal for his family. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected in a calm spell.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{was neither}} aesthetically nor {{technically}} {{among the best}} batsmen, Leyland {{had a reputation for}} batting well under pressure. He performed most effectively against the best teams and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is better than his first-class figures, and against Australia his average is even higher. Outside of Tests, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> success with the ball, and {{had it not been for}} the depth of spin bowling in Yorkshire, he might have been a leading bowler. He was one of the first to bowl left-arm wrist-spin, and may have invented the name to describe such deliveries—"chinamen". Very popular with team-mates and spectators, Leyland had a reputation as a humorist, and many stories were told about him.|$|E
5|$|British Vice-Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney {{had been}} warned that de Grasse was {{planning}} {{to take at least}} part of his fleet north. Although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> clues that he might take his whole fleet (he was aware of the number of pilots de Grasse had requested, for example), he assumed that de Grasse would not leave the French convoy at Cap-Français, and that part of his fleet would escort it to France. So Rodney accordingly divided his fleet, sending Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood north with 15 ships of the line and orders to find de Grasse's destination in North America and report to New York. Rodney, who was ill, took the rest of the fleet back to Britain in order to recover, refit his fleet, and to avoid the Atlantic hurricane season. Hood sailed from Antigua on 10 August, five days after de Grasse. During the voyage, one of his ships became separated and was captured by a privateer.|$|E
5|$|Constantine's {{advisers}} and generals cautioned against preemptive attack on Maxentius; even his soothsayers recommended against it, {{stating that the}} sacrifices had produced unfavorable omens. Constantine, with a spirit that left a deep impression on his followers, inspiring some to believe that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> form of supernatural guidance, ignored all these cautions. Early {{in the spring of}} 312AD, Constantine crossed the Cottian Alps with a quarter of his army, a force numbering about 40,000. The first town his army encountered was Segusium (Susa, Italy), a heavily fortified town that shut its gates to him. Constantine ordered his men to set fire to its gates and scale its walls. He took the town quickly. Constantine ordered his troops not to loot the town, and advanced with them into northern Italy.|$|E

5|$|Dean Lyons {{was born}} on 20 April 1973; he was 24 when he was arrested. He grew up in Tallaght in West Dublin, the fourth {{in a family of}} six children. He went to Scoil Aonghusa National School in Tallaght, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> {{difficulty}} with his schoolwork. According to his teachers, in today's terms, he would have been classified as having a moderate general learning disability. He was assessed by a psychologist when he was in sixth class, around the age of twelve, who found him to have an intelligence quotient of 70. As a result of the psychologist's report, Lyons was moved to St. Joseph's Special School in Tallaght. During his period in St. Joseph's, he developed a reputation for attention seeking and storytelling. After school, he never held down a steady job and drifted into heroin addiction and homelessness. At the time of his arrest for the Grangegorman murders, he had one conviction for burglary, and had been involved in a number of syringe robberies.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{himself had}} {{high hopes for}} his new project. He lacked the {{technical}} skills to program it alone, so instead came up with concepts and consulted technicians {{to see if they}} were possible. He wanted to make the characters different sizes, move in different manners and react in various ways. Yokoi thought Miyamoto's original design was too complex, though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> difficult suggestions himself, such as using see-saws to catapult the hero across the screen (eventually found too hard to program, though a similar concept would appear in the aforementioned Popeye arcade game). Miyamoto then thought of using sloped platforms, barrels and ladders. When he specified that the game would have multiple stages, the four-man programming team complained that he was essentially asking them to make the game repeatedly. Nevertheless, they followed Miyamoto's design, creating a total of approximately 20kilobytes of content. Yukio Kaneoka composed a simple soundtrack to serve as background music for the levels and story events.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the estate}} had been managed as a coppiced woodland, giving Robinson the {{opportunity}} to plant drifts of scilla, cyclamen, and narcissus between the coppiced hazels and chestnuts. On the edges, and in the cleared spaces in the woods, Robinson established plantings of Japanese anemone, lily, acanthus, and pampas grass, along with shrubs such as fothergilla, stewartia, and nyssa. Closer to the house <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> flower beds; throughout he planted red valerian, which he allowed to spread naturally around paving and staircases. Robinson planted thousands of daffodils annually, including 100,000 narcissi planted along one of the lakes in 1897. Over the years he added hundreds of trees, some of them from American friends John Singer Sargent and Frederick Law Olmsted. Other features included an oval-shaped walled kitchen garden, a heather garden, and a water garden {{with one of the}} largest collections of water lilies in Europe.|$|E
