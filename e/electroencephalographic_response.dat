We describe an auditory illusion in which a continuous ongoing tone becomes inaudible during a brief, non-masking noise burst more than one octave away, which is unexpected given the frequency resolution of human hearing.

Participants who were not prone to illusory discontinuity showed robust early <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>responses</b> at 40 - 66 ms after noise burst onset, whereas those prone to the illusion lacked these early responses.

Here, we investigated <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>responses</b> to words, pseudo-words and complex sounds, in conditions where phonological and lexical categorizations were behaviorally successful (categorized stimuli) or unsuccessful (uncategorized stimuli). Data showed a greater decrease in low-beta power at left-hemisphere temporal electrodes for categorized non-lexical sounds (complex sounds and pseudo-words) than for categorized lexical sounds (words), consistent with the signature of a failure in lexical access. Similar differences between lexical and non-lexical sounds were observed for uncategorized stimuli, although these stimuli did not yield evoked potentials or theta activity.

40|$|The {{periodic}} {{presentation of}} a sensory stimulus induces, at certain frequencies of stimulation, a sustained <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>response</b> known as steady-state evoked potentials (SSEP). In the present study we characterize and compare SSEPs elicited by the selective electrical activation of nociceptive Aδ-fibers and non-nociceptive Aβ-fibers. Consistent nociceptive and non-nociceptive SSEPs were recorded at all stimulation frequencies. Whereas non-nociceptive SSEPs were maximal over the parietal region contralateral to the stimulated side, nociceptive SSEPs were maximal at the vertex and symmetrically distributed over both hemispheres, thus indicating that the two responses reflect the entrainment of distinct neuronal populations. For both types of SSEPs, the signal-to-noise was smaller at 7 and 13 Hz, possibly because of background alpha-band activity. Unlike conventional nociceptive event-related potentials, nociceptive SSEPs did not habituate, suggesting that they reflect more obligatory stages of sensory processing...|$|E

The signal was convoluted with a family of complex wavelets. Intracranial sources of activity at various narrow-band frequencies were estimated in the 100 - to 400 -ms time window following feedback onset. Positive and negative feedback were associated to 1) early parahippocampo-cingular sources of alpha oscillations, more posteriorly located and long lasting for negative feedback and to 2) late partially overlapping neural. circuits comprising regions in prefrontal, cingular, and temporal cortices but operating at feedback-specific latencies and frequencies.

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{demonstrated}} that addicts behave less flexibly than healthy controls in the probabilistic reversal-learning task (PRLT), in which participants must gradually learn to choose between a probably-rewarded option and an improbably-rewarded one, on the basis of corrective feedback, and in which preferences must adjust to abrupt reward contingency changes (reversals). In the present study, pathological gamblers (PG) and cocaine-dependent individuals (CDI) showed different learning curves in the PRLT. PG also showed a reduced <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>response</b> to feedback (Feedback-Related Negativity, FRN) when compared to controls. CDI’s FRN was not significantly different either from PG or HC’s. Additionally, according to sLORETA analysis, cortical activity in regions of interest (previously selected by virtue of their involvement in FRN generation in controls) strongly differed between CDI and PG. However, the nature of such anomalies varied within-groups across individuals. Cocaine use severity had a strong deleterious impact on the learning asymptote, whereas gambling intensity significantly increased reversal cost.

40|$|Speech {{and vocal}} sounds {{are at the}} core of human communication. Cortical {{processing}} of these sounds critically depends on behavioral demands. However, the neurocomputational mechanisms enabling this adaptive processing remain elusive. Here we examine the task-dependent reorganization of <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>responses</b> to natural speech sounds (vowels /a/, /i/, /u/) spoken by three speakers (two female, one male) while listeners perform a one-back task on either vowel or speaker identity. We show that dynamic changes of sound-evoked responses and phase patterns of cortical oscillations in the alpha band (8 - 12 Hz) closely reflect the abstraction and analysis of the sounds along the task-relevant dimension. Vowel categorization leads to a significant temporal realignment of responses to the same vowel, e. g., /a/, independent of who pronounced this vowel, whereas speaker categorization leads to a significant temporal realignment of responses to the same speaker, e. g., speaker 1, independent of which vowel she/he pronounced. This transient and goal-dependent realignment of neuronal responses to physically different external events provides a robust cortical coding mechanism for forming and processing abstract representations of auditory (speech) input...|$|R

Following ethical approval and written informed consent we induced thermal stimuli using the Medoc PATHWAY Pain & Sensory Evaluation System on the right hand of the patient with the spinal cord stimulator switched off and with the spinal cord stimulator switched on. The patient reported a clinically significant reduction in thermal induced pain using the numerical rating scale (71. 4 % reduction) with spinal cord stimulator switched on. Analysis of electroencephalogram recordings indicated the occurrence of contact heat evoked potentials (N 2 -P 2) with spinal cord stimulator off, but not with spinal cord stimulator on.

40|$|Background: Making an {{accurate}} diagnosis {{in patients with}} disorders of consciousness remains challenging. 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) –PET has been validated as a diagnostic tool in this population, and allows identifying unresponsive patients with a capacity for consciousness. In parallel, the perturbational complexity index (PCI), a new measure based on {{the analysis of the}} <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>response</b> to transcranial magnetic stimulation, has also been suggested as a tool to distinguish between unconscious and conscious states. The aim {{of the study was to}} cross-validate FDG–PET and PCI, and to identify signs of consciousness in otherwise unresponsive patients. Methods: We jointly applied the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised, FDG–PET and PCI to assess 24 patients with non-acute disorders of consciousness or locked-in syndrome (13 male; 19 – 54  years old; 12 traumatic; 9 unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, 11 minimally conscious state; 2 emergence from the minimally conscious state, and 2 locked-in syndrome). Results: FDG–PET and PCI provided congruent results in 22 patients, regardless of their behavioural diagnosis. Notably, FDG–PET and PCI revealed preserved metabolic rates and high complexity levels in four patients who were behaviourally unresponsive.

40|$|Pain is {{a multidimensional}} experience, which {{includes}} sensory, cognitive, and affective aspects. Converging lines of evidence indicate that dopaminergic neurotransmission {{plays an important}} role in human pain perception. However, the precise effects of dopamine on different aspects of pain perception remain to be elucidated. To address this question, we experimentally decreased dopaminergic neurotransmission in 22 healthy human subjects using Acute Phenylalanine and Tyrosine Depletion (APTD). During APTD and a control condition we applied brief painful laser stimuli to the hand, assessed different aspects of pain perception, and recorded <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>responses.</b> APTD-induced decreases of cerebral dopaminergic activity did not influence sensory aspects of pain perception. In contrast, APTD yielded increases of pain unpleasantness. The increases of unpleasantness ratings positively correlated with effectiveness of APTD. Our finding of an influence of dopaminergic neurotransmission on affective but not sensory aspects of phasic pain suggests that analgesic effects of dopamine might be mediated by indirect effects on pain affect rather than by direct effects on ascending nociceptive signals. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex relationship between dopamine and pain perception, which may play a role in various clinical pain states...|$|R

Their <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>responses</b> were recorded after 12, 18 and 24 months of implant use, revealing a large dichotomy: Some children failed to show semantic processing throughout their second year of CI use, which fell in line with their poor language outcomes. The majority of children, though, demonstrated semantic processing in form of the so-called N 400 effect already after 12 months of implant use, even when their language experience relied exclusively on the implant. This is slightly earlier than observed for normal hearing children of the same auditory age, suggesting that more mature cognitive faculties at the beginning of language acquisition lead to faster semantic learning...|$|R

Additionally, not much {{is known about the}} timing or nature of the connection between language and sensory-motor neural processing. We used stimuli divided into three figurativeness conditions – literal, metaphor, and anomalous – and two modality conditions – auditory (Her limousine was a privileged snort) and motion (The editorial was a brass-knuckle punch). The conditions were matched on a large number of potentially confounding factors including cloze probability.

Results supported the possibility of different neural substrates for motion and auditory sentences. Greater differences for motion sentences were seen in the left posterior and left central electrode sites than elsewhere on the scalp.

Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} SS-EP have several advantages over the recording of transient event-related brain potentials (ERP), such as a high signal-to-noise ratio, a shorter time to obtain reliable signals, and the capacity to frequency-tag the cortical activity elicited by concurrently presented sensory stimuli.

40|$|The <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>response</b> to {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (TMS) {{recently has}} been established as a direct parameter of motor cortex excitability. Its N 100 component was suggested to reflect an inhibitory response. We investigated influences of cerebral maturation on TMS-evoked N 100 in 6 - to 10 -year-old healthy children. We used a forewarned reaction time (contingent negative variation) task to test the effects of response preparation and sensory attention on N 100 amplitude. Single-pulse TMS of motor cortex at 105 % motor threshold intensity evoked N 100 amplitudes of more than 100 V in resting children (visible in single trials), which correlated negatively with age and positively with absolute stimulation intensity. During late contingent negative variation, which involves preactivation of the cortical structures necessary for a fast response, N 100 amplitude was significantly reduced. We conclude that (1) N 100 amplitude reduction during late contingent negative variation provides further evidence that TMS-evoked N 100 reflects inhibitory processes, (2) response preparation and attention modulate N 100, and (3) TMS-evoked N 100 under-goes maturational changes and could serve to test cortical integrity and inhibitory function in children. Parallels between the inhibitory N 100 after TMS (provoking massive synchronous excitation) and the inhibitory wave component of epileptic spike wave complexes are suggested.

40|$|The neural {{response}} to a violation of sequences of identical sounds is a typical example of the brain's sensitivity to auditory regularities. Previous literature interprets this effect as a pre-attentive and unconscious processing of sensory stimuli.

The objective {{of this study is to}} investi-gate the basic mechanisms of multimodal integration by assessing the intermodal influences of vision, audition, and somatosensory sensations (the influence of multisensory background events to the target event). We used a timed target detection task, and measured both behavioral and <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>responses</b> to visual target events (green solid circle), auditory target events (2 kHz pure tone) and somatosensory target events (1. 5 ± 0. 1 mA square wave pulse) from 20 normal participants. There were significant differences in both behavior performance and ERP components when comparing the unimodal target stimuli with multimodal (bimodal and trimodal) target stimuli for all target groups. Significant correlation among reaction time and P 3 latency was observed across all target conditions. The perceptual processing of auditory target events (A) was inhibited by the background events, while the perceptual processing of somatosensory target events (S) was facilitated by the background events. In contrast, the perceptual processing of visual target events (V) remained impervious to multisensory background events...|$|R
40|$|The {{periodic}} {{presentation of}} a sensory stimulus induces, at certain frequencies of stimulation, a sustained <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>response</b> known as steady-state evoked potential (SS-EP). In the somatosensory, visual, and auditory modalities, SS-EPs are considered to constitute an electrophysiological correlate of cortical sensory networks resonating at the frequency of stimulation. In the present study, we describe and characterize, for the first time, SS-EPs elicited by the selective activation of skin nociceptors in humans. The stimulation consisted of 2. 3 -s-long trains of 16 identical infrared laser pulses (frequency, 7 Hz), applied to the dorsum of {{the left and right}} hand and foot. Two different stimulation energies were used. The low energy activated only C-nociceptors, whereas the high energy activated both A delta- and C-nociceptors. Innocuous electrical stimulation of large-diameter A beta-fibers involved in the perception of touch and vibration was used as control. The high-energy nociceptive stimulus elicited a consistent SS-EP, related to the activation of A delta-nociceptors. Regardless of stimulus location, the scalp topography of this response was maximal at the vertex. This was noticeably different from the scalp topography of the SS-EPs elicited by innocuous vibrotactile stimulation, which displayed a clear maximum over the parietal region contralateral to the stimulated side. Therefore, we hypothesize that the SS-EPs elicited by the rapid periodic thermal activation of nociceptors may reflect the activation of a network that is preferentially involved in processing nociceptive input and may thus provide some important insight into the cortical processes generating painful percepts...|$|E

In patients with first-episode psychosis, such studies are still scarce and mostly focused on auditory sensory processing. The present study aimed to explore whether subtle deficits of cortical activation are present in these patients before the decline of working memory performance. Methods: We assessed exogenous and endogenous ERPs and frontal theta event-related synchronization (ERS) in patients with first-episode psychosis and healthy controls who successfully performed an adapted 2 -back working memory task, including 2 visual n-backworking memory tasks as well as oddball detection and passive fixation tasks. Results: We included 15 patients with first-episode psychosis and 18 controls in this study. Compared with controls, patients with first-episode psychosis displayed increased latencies of early visual ERPs and phasic theta ERS culmination peak in all conditions. However, they also showed a rapid recruitment of working memory-related neural generators, even in pure attention tasks, {{as indicated by the}} decreased N 200 latency and increased amplitude of sustained theta ERS in detection compared with controls. Limitations: Owing to the limited sample size, no distinction was made between patients with first-episode psychosis with positive and negative symptoms.

The human electrophysiological (<b>electroencephalographic)</b> <b>responses</b> to each face half increased in amplitude when different rather than repeated face half identities were presented at every stimulation cycle. Contrary to the repetition suppression effects for whole faces, which are usually found over the right occipito-temporal cortex, these part-based repetition suppression effects were found on all posterior electrode sites and were unchanged when the two face halves were manipulated by separation, lateral misalignment, or inversion. In contrast, intermodulation components (e. g. 7. 14 - 5. 88 = 1. 26 Hz) were found mainly over the right occipito-temporal cortex and were significantly reduced following the aforementioned manipulations. In addition, the intermodulation components decreased substantially for face halves belonging to different identities, which form a less coherent face than when they belong to the same face identity.

At the completion of treatment protocols, patients receiving rifaximin showed lower serum ammonia levels [weighted mean difference (WMD) = - 10. 65; 95 % CI: - 23. 4 - 2. 1; P = 0. 10], better mental status (WMD = - 0. 24; 95 % CI: - 0. 57 - 0. 08; P = 0. 15) and less asterixis (WMD - 0. 1; 95 % CI - 0. 26 - 0. 07; P = 0. 25) without reaching statistical significance. On the other hand, other psychometric outcomes such as <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>response</b> and grades of portosystemic encephalopathy were superior in patients treated with rifaximin in comparison to the control group (WMD = 0. 21, 95 % CI: - 0. 33 - 0. 09, P = 0. 0004; and WMD = - 2. 33, 95 % CI: - 2. 68 - 1. 98, P = 0. 00001, respectively). Subgroup and sensitivity analysis did not show any significant difference in the above findings. CONCLUSION: Rifaximin appears to be at least as effective as other conventional oral agents for the treatment of HE with a better safety profile...|$|E
40|$|Photosensitivity is a {{condition}} in which lights induce epileptiform activities. This abnormal <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>response</b> has been associated with hyperexcitability of the visuo-motor system. Here, we evaluate if intrinsic dysfunction of this network is present in brain activity at rest, independently of any stimulus and of any paroxysmal electroencephalographic activity. To address this issue, we investigated the haemodynamic correlates of the spontaneous alpha rhythm, which is considered the hallmark of the brain resting state, in photosensitive patients and in people without photosensitivity. Second, we evaluated the whole-brain functional connectivity of the visual thalamic nuclei in the various populations of subjects under investigation. Forty-four patients with epilepsy and 16 healthy control subjects underwent an electroencephalography-correlated functional magnetic resonance imaging study, during an eyes-closed condition. The following patient groups were included: (i) genetic generalized epilepsy with photosensitivity, 16 subjects (mean age 25 +/- 10 years); (ii) genetic generalized epilepsy without photosensitivity, 13 patients (mean age 25 +/- 11 years); (iii) focal epilepsy, 15 patients (mean age 25 +/- 9 years). For each subject, the posterior alpha power variations were convolved with the standard haemodynamic response function and used as a regressor. Within-and between-groups second level analyses were performed. Whole brain functional connectivity was evaluated for two thalamic regions of interest, based on the haemodynamic findings, which included the posterior thalamus (pulvinar) and the medio-dorsal thalamic nuclei. Genetic generalized epilepsy with photosensitivity demonstrated significantly greater mean alpha-power with respect to controls and other epilepsy groups. In photosensitive epilepsy, alpha-related blood oxygen level-dependent signal changes demonstrated lower decreases relative to all other groups in the occipital, sensory-motor, anterior cingulate and supplementary motor cortices. Coherently, the same brain regions demonstrated abnormal connectivity with the visual thalamus only in epilepsy patients with photosensitivity. As predicted, our findings indicate that the cortical-subcortical network generating the alpha oscillation at rest is different in people with epilepsy and visual sensitivity. This difference consists of a decreased alpharelated inhibition of the visual cortex and sensory-motor networks at rest. These findings represent the substrate of the clinical manifestations (i. e. myoclonus) of the photoparoxysmal response. Moreover, our results provide the first evidence of the existence of a functional link between the circuits that trigger the visual sensitivity phenomenon and those that generate the posterior alpha rhythm...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPhysical {{properties}} of visual stimuli affect electrophysiological markers of perception. One important stimulus property is spatial frequency (SF). Therefore, we studied {{the influence of}} SF on human alpha (8 – 13 Hz) and gamma (> 30 Hz) <b>electroencephalographic</b> (EEG) <b>responses</b> in a choice reaction task. Since real world images contain multiple SFs, an SF mixture was also examined. Event related potentials were modulated by SF around 80 and 300 ms. Evoked gamma responses were strongest for the low SF and the mixture stimulus; alpha responses were strongest for high SFs. The results link evoked and induced alpha and evoked gamma responses in human EEG to different modes of stimulus processing...|$|R
40|$|We {{recorded}} the <b>electroencephalographic</b> (EEG) <b>responses</b> evoked by {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS) during the first rapid eye movement (REM) sleep episode {{of the night and}} we compared them with the responses obtained during previous wakefulness and NREM sleep. Confirming previous findings, upon falling into NREM sleep, cortical activations became more local and stereotypical, indicating a significant impairment of the intracortical dialogue. During REM sleep, a state in which subjects regain consciousness but are almost paralyzed, TMS triggered more widespread and differentiated patterns of cortical activation, that were similar to the ones observed in wakefulness. Similarly, TMS/hd-EEG may be used to probe the internal dialogue of the thalamocortical system in brain injured patients that are unable to move and communicate...|$|R
40|$|Separating {{concurrent}} sounds {{is fundamental}} for a veridical perception of one's auditory surroundings. Sound components that are harmonically related and {{start at the}} same time are usually grouped into a common perceptual object, whereas components that are not in harmonic relation or have different onset times {{are more likely to be}} perceived in terms of separate objects. Here we tested whether neonates are able to pick up the cues supporting this sound organization principle. We presented newborn infants with a series of complex tones with their harmonics in tune (creating the percept of a unitary sound object) and with manipulated variants, which gave the impression of two concurrently active sound sources. The manipulated variant had either one mistuned partial (single-cue condition) or the onset of this mistuned partial was also delayed (double-cue condition). Tuned and manipulated sounds were presented in random order with equal probabilities. Recording the neonates' <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>responses</b> allowed us to evaluate their processing of the sounds. Results show that, in both conditions, mistuned sounds elicited a negative displacement of the event-related potential (ERP) relative to tuned sounds from 360 to 400 ms after sound onset. The mistuning-related ERP component resembles the object-related negativity (ORN) component in adults, which is associated with concurrent sound segregation. Delayed onset additionally led to a negative displacement from 160 to 200 ms, which was probably more related to the physical parameters of the sounds than to their perceptual segregation. The elicitation of an ORN-like response in newborn infants suggests that neonates possess the basic capabilities of segregating concurrent sounds by detecting inharmonic relations between the co-occurring sounds...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of an attempt to find means of {{diagnostic}} value and understand the underlying mechanisms of photosensitive epilepsy which is a variety of epilepsy where seizures are provoked by photic stimuli. A detailed review of the relative literature has been endeavoured. The aspects dealt with were mainly concerned with <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>responses</b> to intermittent photic stimulation. It has been found that intermittent photic stimulation is more effective on "eye-closure" than in any other eye state and more abnormalities are induced when the eyes are open than when they are closed. The significance of light in the provocation of "eye-closure" induced discharges has been emphasized. The characteristics of the occipital spikes induced by intermittent photic stimulation have been studied. The majority of photosensitive epileptic patients and those with epilepsy who are not clinically photosensitive but in whom E. G. abnormalities are provoked by intermittent photic stimulation, show occipital spikes alone or preceding photoconvulsive responses, during photic stimulation. Tbe occipital spikes were compared with the visual evoked responses of the same patients and of normal subjects. This showed that there was no simple relation between occipital spikes and components of visual evoked responses. The characteristics of the negative occipital spike show striking similarities to those of the recruiting response evoked by electrical stimulation of the non-specific thalamic nuclei as described by other authors. This may indicate that the non-specific thalamocortical system is responsible for the genesis of the "epileptogenic" occip:ital spikes and therefore implicated in the pathogenesis of photosensitive epilepsy. The intermittent photic stimulation showed an increased effectiveness when combined with patterns and {{this may be due to}} an increased susceptibility of the occipital cortex. It is suggested that seizures in photosensitive epilepsy are the result of discharges arising from abnormally activated,by photic stimuli, non-specific thalamic system and impinging upon a hypersensitive occipital cortex...|$|R
