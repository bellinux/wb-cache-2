40|$|The {{push for}} {{ecosystem}} based management {{has opened up}} not only for including more of the natural systems when managing fish resources, but also a broader perspective on the human systems, and the diverse activities in the sea. This is reflected for instance in the EU Maritime Policy where fisheries {{is just one of}} many activities that marine management must take into account. Research into valuation of natural resources has shown that non-use values may be substantial in the marine environment; These are e. g. existence values, such as the existence of rare species and benthic components such as corals, and option values with regard to potential future applications, e. g. in marine bioprospecting. In addition, <b>indirect</b> <b>use</b> <b>values,</b> such as habitat values, recreational values and nutrient cycling often far exceed the direct <b>use</b> <b>values,</b> which are typically the value of the fisheries, aquaculture and marine tourism.

Forests have an important role as a source of foreign exchange and also as a form of natural resource wealth. The era of globalization with the accelerated economic growth increases the need for both, the fields of agriculture, infrastructure, land requirements and other sectors. Increased human needs are giving a positive correlation to the increased pressure on forests. Mangrove forests {{as one of}} the most productive ecosystems in the world are also experiencing the same threat. The expansion of settlements and ponds in coastal areas lead to degradation of mangrove forests is very high. The economic value of mangrove forests of diverse functions such as shoreline protection, habitat for aquatic organisms, carbon storage, and a variety of other functions has not been a lot of concern to the public and policy makers. This study aimed to quantify the economic value of mangrove forests in Untung Jawa Island, Thousand Islands as an effort to support the government's program to realize the green economy in the forestry sector. Method of economic calculation mangrove forests in this research is to calculate the Total Economic Value / Total Economic Valuation (TEV), which consists of direct use values (Direct Use Value) and indirect use values (<b>Indirect</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Value).</b> The results showed that the direct use value of mangrove forests in Untung Jawa Island is Rp. 395, 126, 912 which includes the value of timber, fruit value, and the value of the fishery, while the <b>indirect</b> <b>use</b> <b>value</b> is Rp. 7, 500, 600, 000 calculated from the value of coastal protection, the value of foraging, conservation value, educational value, and recreational value.

However, management of the wetland often does not remain priority and recognized as the unproductive waste land mainly due to poor realization of the economic value of the wetlands. Taking this into account, the study estimated the total economic value of the Jagadishpur Reservoir taking into account direct, indirect, and nonuse value. The study prioritized six major values of the reservoir which include wetland goods consumption, tourism, irrigation, carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and conservation for future use (existence and option value). The study used market and nonmarket based valuation techniques to estimate total economic value of the reservoir. Household survey, focus group discussions, and interaction with the tourism entrepreneurs and district stakeholders were carried out to collect information.

Here we argue that a precise definition is available and could help focus valuation studies, but that in using this scientific definition (a three-dimensional measure of total difference), valuation by stated-preference methods becomes, at best, very difficult. We reclassify the valuation studies reviewed by Bartkowski et al.

Our analysis shows that almost all of the studies reviewed by Bartkowski et al.

Alternative economic methods should be found to value biodiversity as it is defined in natural science. We suggest options based on a production function analogy or cost-based methods. Particularly the first of these provides a strong link between economic theory and ecological research and is empirically practical. Since applied science emphasizes a scientific definition of biodiversity in the design and justification of conservation plans, the need for economic valuation of this quantitative meaning of biodiversity is considerable and as yet unfulfilled...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the economic value of Protected Areas (PA) in the Congo Basin.

This is because little or no specific information exists on the value of PAs in the sub-region, whereas data are available which look at the economic benefits associated with natural forests. In effect, the values referred to below therefore indicate the economic benefits that are generated from the conservation and sustainable use of forest biodiversity and ecosystems in the Congo Basin – to which ends which PAs provide an important conservation mechanism. The total economic value (TEV) is applied here as framework used to categorise ecosystem values.

The research was conducted in Pulau Rimau tidal area, South Sumatra. The data collection was stratified random sampling, such as monoculture oil palm and mixed farming (integration between oil palm and cattle fattening). The method was divided into three categories, such as utilization identification, quantifying, and valuing of utilization. Feasibility of forest conversion was calculated using NPV, net BCR and IRR. The research results showed that Pulau Rimau utilization has very big economic role in increasing the society welfare around Pulau Rimau of 16, 700 ha.

40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2010. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the economic value of the Lopé National Park in Gabon. The creation of the Lopé National Park (LNP) in 2002 aimed at answering international engagements of Gabon as regards conservation of the biodiversity. To be able to value this protected area, an economic valuation technique called the Total Economic Value was applied. Total economic value (TEV) is a valuation method which attempts to estimate monetarily some tangible and intangible environmental benefits. After a brief presentation and an overview of legal aspects of the LNP, two management scenarios were considered: a scenario „with the Lopé National Park‟ and a scenario „without the Lopé National Park‟. The former scenario takes in account the establishment of the park whereas the latter suggests the non-establishment of the park. A set of hypotheses was set to perform the valuation. Furthermore, the data used in this study was based on primary research and various telephone interviews to confirm their validity. Based on various valuation techniques, selected tangible and intangible ecosystem benefits classified as direct <b>use</b> <b>values,</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>use</b> <b>values,</b> option values and existence values were quantified. The result of this study shows that the economic value of the scenario with the Lopé National Park produces a higher economic value than the scenario without the Lopé National Park. In other words, the decision to establish a protected area is a justifiably sound economic decision as it creates social welfare at local, national and international level. It is important to note that this valuation exercise is incomplete as this study does not take into account all the environmental benefits generated by any forest ecosystem due to the difficulty in valuing its intangible nature...|$|R

The wetland ecosystem service values revealed considerable spatial variability. Poyang Lake, Hong Lake, and Shijiu Lake have the most ecosystem service value. The value of human-macle wetlands (2. 62 x 10 (4) US $/ha/yr) is 48 % lower than that of natural wetlands (5. 04 x 10 (4) US $/hafyr), indicating that the conversion of natural wetlands for aquaculture from the sustainability perspective is not significant.

40|$|The {{elephant}} {{population in}} the Kruger Trans-frontier Park is currently seen by many nature conservationists as beyond sustainable levels. Wild-life supporters are of {{the view that the}} elephant population should be sustained. Ecologists warn that over-population of the elephant population is putting too much stress on the environment, which may make it impossible to sustain other plant and wild life forms in the long run. The paper has as its main aim to evaluate Environmental (Ecological), Cultural, Economic and Social dimensions of sustainability using Economic Impact Analysis to appraise different options of managing the elephant {{population in the}} Kruger Trans-frontier Park. The authors believe that this research would contribute greatly to the debate {{in other parts of the}} world. If not managed properly, an overpopulation of elephants often leads to environmental degradation. Such degradation could lead to a loss in ecosystem function (<b>indirect</b> <b>use</b> <b>value),</b> which not only implies a loss in ecosystem productivity and resilience, but also the need for ecosystem restoration. The sometimes irreversible damage, such as the extinction of other animal and plant species caused as a result of overpopulation of elephant, is a direct cost to the environment and society. This cost is not reflected in, for example, the value an international tourist derives from viewing elephants in the park or protected area where the damage-causing specie lives. Studies undertaken thus far, are mainly based on an economic valuation of the elephant in relation to economic variables that are quantifiable, and also mainly under very limited assumptions. These are but some of the important issues considered in this paper in order to derive Best-Practice appraisal methodology. Although the authors suggest a cost-benefit analysis, it only offers very limited appraisal and the authors therefore argue in favor of a much more rigorous partial equilibrium analysis...|$|E

This is a valuable water body in several aspects and there are requests and proposals arising from the surrounding community, political authorities and governmental and non-governmental organizations to improve the Boralesgamuwa Lake for several uses such as irrigation, recreational activities, leisure space for community as to develop ecotourism, aquaculture and flood detention. Even though there are such uses, water pollution, solid waste disposal in and around the lake and negative social impacts from visitors could have to be managed in a social and environmental friendly manner, inorder to minimize the negative impacts happening to the lake.

A qualitative approach is combined witheconomic concepts {{and the use of}} this method is explored through a case study in which the impact on ecosystemservices is integrated into a strategic environmental assessment. The case study used in this thesis concerns theP 18 area in Visborg, south of Visby, Gotland, which has been earmarked in a detailed development plan tobecome a sports and recreation area. The plan allows for the building of a sports hall, rerouting of the runningtracks and the discontinuation of the motocross circuit. The study evaluates the impact of the implementation ofthe plan on ecosystem services and how this affects their stakeholders. In this study the impacts on the ecosystem services are identified through a desktop study of the strategicenvironmental assessment and complementing documents. Semi-structured interviews were held with thestakeholders of the ecosystem services in the area about the benefits they receive and their perception of these. The results from the interviews are subsequently categorized using template analysis into the sub-values of totaleconomic value: use value, <b>indirect</b> <b>use</b> <b>value,</b> option value, altruist value, bequest value and existence value. The results showed that the ecosystem services are connected through their biophysical structures as well as theirstakeholders. This showed {{it is important to keep}} a holistic view when doing an assessment on the impact onecosystem services as they are all connected and embedded in society. Furthermore, it showed that it wasdifficult for the stakeholders to relate to some of the values that comprise the total economic value.

The suggestions based on this case study are to continue research into alternative methods of assessingecosystem services in strategic environmental assessment. It is further recommended that this research looks intousing interdisciplinary methods to ensure that the method is all encompassing...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{potential}} for socioeconomically sustainable peatland use by investigating conflicting interests, revealing trade-offs that {{people are willing to}} accept, and studying whether opinions are dependent on socioeconomic and demographic factors. Opinions toward five forms of peatland use and seven peatland ecosystem services were surveyed in Northern Ostrobothnia in northern Finland in 2011. Choice experiment (CE) was used to reveal trade-offs in land use preferences, and groups of respondents were identified using the latent class model (LCM). We identified three classes of respondents in which environmentalists showed a high preference toward the cessation of peat production and increase of peatland restoration, the production-oriented class preferred an increase in timber and peat production areas, and the current use supporters agreed on the present land use policy. However, all respondent classes agreed on the increase of nature protection and the present level of timber production and disagreed on the cessation of restoration. The CE revealed that environmentally minded people who are likely to consider the <b>indirect</b> <b>use</b> <b>values</b> and existence values important are less willing to make trade-offs between ecosystem services than those who emphasize direct <b>use</b> <b>values.</b> Because peatland restoration occurs in commercially unproductive peatlands, it improves both the direct <b>use</b> and existence <b>values</b> without reducing provisioning services of peatlands. Therefore, restoration is commonly accepted by the public, in contrast to management options that involve clear trade-offs between ecosystem services. We conclude that the understanding of preferences and trade-offs can enhance sustainable land use planning. It may be unrealistic, however, to expect a solution that all interest groups would completely accept...|$|R
40|$|The {{exploitation}} and conversion of rangeland ecosystems is often explained by economists {{as being the}} result of an undervaluation of the goods and services provided by the rangelands. Undervaluation of rangelands may contribute to their mismanagement or their transformation to monoculture, such as livestock or gathering. Similarly, this may lead to inappropriate policy recommendations and prescriptions. This study undertakes a valuation exercise in an effort to address causes of undervaluation. The objective of the study is to estimate the annual direct, indirect and non-use values per household of communal rangelands in the Eastern Cape Province, based on both primary and secondary data. The exercise incorporates the two major direct uses, both marketed and non-marketed, of rangelands - livestock and gathering. Contingent valuation method based on stated preferences by individual household was <b>used</b> to <b>value</b> the <b>indirect</b> and non-use values of the communal rangelands (e. g. erosion protection and burial sites). Data was collected using PRAs, structured questionnaires and interviews by trained enumerators. The study shows that half of the households owned livestock, which is the main economic use of the rangelands and gathering of natural resources also made an economic contribution. Every household was involved in collection of range resources such as fuel wood, wild fruits, thatch grass, building poles, hunting, fishing make a significant contribution to the direct use values: in the case of gathering it shows that there is “hidden harvest” of many of the natural resources from the rangelands. Indirect and non-use values are shown to be important in the communal areas but are difficult to quantify; the results of these are based on qualitative analysis.

40|$|Economic {{valuation}} of the Okavango Delta can support {{decision making in}} a complex socio-economic environment in which economic development depends on a deep understanding {{of the value of}} biodiversity. The use of a natural resource accounting framework in determining the value of goods and services is crucial. The total economic value of the Okavango Delta was estimated by using primary (household valuation) and secondary data. A natural resource accounting framework was used. The components of the total economic value were the composition of wild herbivores and vegetation, and the functional values, which comprised direct <b>use</b> <b>values</b> of wild herbivores, river reed, thatching grass, wild fruits, fuelwood and palm leaves, indirect consumptive values of honey production, carbon sequestration, livestock grazing, milk production, non-consumptive use of tourism, and existence and bequest values. The values of the composition and function are expressed in per/ha values. The value of the composition of wild herbivores was estimated at P 1 444 992 400 (US$ 294 850 699. 2) or US$ 27. 4 /ha, while the functional value was estimated at P 185 913 117. 4 (US$ 37 527 840. 96 or US$ 619. 77 /ha. Of the estimated direct <b>use</b> <b>values</b> of vegetation, river reed had the highest value of US$ 29. 0 /ha, while the highest <b>value</b> among <b>indirect</b> <b>use</b> <b>values</b> was that of milk production (US$ 8. 5 /ha). These values of selected resources reflect the contribution of the value of biodiversity of the Okavango Delta to the overall economy of the country and represent initial estimates of costs to society if these resources are lost. The estimated <b>values</b> can be <b>used</b> to raise awareness among decision makers of the economic benefits of conserving the Okavango Delta. Overall, the findings showed that the various components of the total economic value of the Okavango Delta were comparable to other wetlands in the region.

40|$|As {{practice}} shows us, at {{the present}} time ecosystem services are recognized by humanity, but unfortunately are undervalued compared to their full potential. Most of planet's ecosystems are degradated by anthropic activity of humankind. It is almost impossible {{to say that there are}} no areas affected by human activity, however, the Protected Areas are a good opportunity, so the assessing of ecosystem services in Protected Areas can be a solution to the problem of economic growth. At present, there are few consistent informations on economic value of ecosystem services in Romania, on the basis of which can be adopted some sustainable financing policies of activities in Protected Areas. The premise from which we start is that a proper management of natural capital will allow biodiversity conservation and human well-being if it find appropriate economic instruments. For this reason, studies of economic research on the contribution of those ecosystem services to the communities welfare may constitute credible means for decision-makers, demonstrating the Protected Areas importance. This paper, based on the study of international and national literature, examines the state of knowledge on the economic and environmental valences of ecosystem services. The growing interest of researchers regarding the economic valuation of ecosystem services related to Protected Areas is visible through the many studies carried out at international level. Although national scientific research relating to ecosystem services is at the beginning, concerns researchers economists and ecologists have been directed toward this recess, of ecosystem services. The reason for we should assign an economic value to ecosystem services is to ensure that their value is included actively in decision-making and is not ignored because "is still available". Briefly, the paper start with an overview of the main definition of ecosystem services. From the point of economic value view, the paper include a theory of value review, and after this was elucidated aspects as Total Economic Value, direct use value, <b>indirect</b> <b>use</b> <b>value,</b> non-use value, bequest and exchange value. The value theory is presented in terms of labor, utility or entropy. In conclusion was carried out a briefly overview of reason to research ecosystem services within Protected Areas...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{distinctions between}} management objectives and economic {{values in the}} uses of National Parks. The authors use historical and philosophical resources in the presentation of ideas. The article reviews some issues relating to the foundations of National Park administration, describing the distinction between preservation and conservationism and their connections to ecocentrism, anthropocentrism and deep ecology. The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) has established a six-category system of protected areas to clarify the differences between various objectives for protected areas including National Parks. National Parks are designated for three primary management objectives with equal emphasis on each, viz. preservation of species and genetic diversity; maintenance of environmental services; and tourism and recreation. Secondary objectives of National Parks include scientific, educational, spiritual and aesthetic uses, which are likely compatible with the primary goals. However, it is often questioned whether the primary goals are able to coexist among themselves. For example, recreational uses are often {{in conflict with the}} preservation goal. The management objectives for National Parks can be rearranged into three components, viz. preservation, conservation and public use. In the literature, the economic value of natural resources is often classified into direct use value, <b>indirect</b> <b>use</b> <b>value,</b> option value, bequest value and existence value. This value typology has widespread a misconception that each individual economic value category additively counts towards the total economic value. In a way of avoiding this confusion, the economic value of National Parks is to be grouped into three categories. They are preservation value, conservation-based use value and development-based use value. This typology employs the everyday speech and matches the IUCN classification of National Parks management objectives. More importantly, this classification clearly reveals that the economic value of National Parks is not the additive sum of the component values, because of incompatibility between the values pursued in the management of National Parks. Multiple management objectives for National Parks defined by IUCN are increasingly being integrated within domestic legislation by a number of countries in the world. The materials integrated in this article will help administration authorities of National Parks to shape up appropriate National Parks management strategies...|$|E
30|$|Protected areas (PAs - {{national}} parks, wildlife sanctuaries, {{and reserve}} forests) are planned and managed {{with the prime}} objective of biodiversity conservation (Bruner et al. 2001; Wilkie et al. 2008). The PAs, generally considered the core units for in-situ conservation, provide several ecosystem goods and services of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>use</b> <b>values,</b> optional values, and the existence or non-use values (Schreckenberg et al. 2016; Weisbrod, 1964; Krutilla, 1967; Arrow & Fischer 1974). Across the world, the number of PAs has almost {{doubled in the past}} 2 decades (Deguignet et al., 2014), and the number (recorded in the World Data base on Protected Areas) lately is 202, 467 terrestrial and inland water protected areas, covering 14.7 % of the world’s extent of these ecosystems (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN, 2016). Almost all PAs have human habitations abutting their boundaries, which intricately interact with wildlife and habitats within (Mulongoy & Chape, 2004; Chape et al. 2005). Thus, PAs are under human pressure, from population growth and land use intensification, a major issue for the management (Cincotta et al. 2000). Effect of PAs on their human neighbors is a widely debated issue (Adams et al., 2004; Brockington et al. 2006; Joppa et al. 2009). The importance of managing such interplays, positive and negative, vital in sustaining the ecological setting of the PAs, is well recognized (DeFries et al. 2010; Pullin et al., 2013). The Convention on Biological Diversity (2010) has been consistently advocating involvement of indigenous people and stakeholders, and equitable and effective management of PAs. However, across the world and particularly in India not much progress is made in this line.|$|R

An integrated coastal zone management approach has become an important requirement of future development plans to protect this fragile bay ecosystem. One of the main indicators of deterioration of the Izmit Bay coastal system is the decreasing water quality resulting from increased nutrient loads from the surrounding land. The consensus during the initial stakeholder meeting confirmed the widespread awareness of this phenomenon and "improvement of water quality in Izmit Bay" was determined as the main policy issue at stake. Public perception of and satisfaction with water quality were measured by a willingness to pay (WTP) survey. The WTP for improved water quality was analyzed using the contingent valuation method. According to the questionnaire survey, 55 % of the participants {{are willing to pay}} to increase the water quality. Impact of water quality on real-estate values was evaluated by hedonic pricing method, which is suitable for estimating direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>use</b> <b>values</b> of water resources. These results were used in a simulation model to assess coupled ecosystem, social, and economic system functioning of the Izmit Bay in response to various scenarios, and thus, to permit the necessary actions to be taken proactively. Two scenario simulations, for which domestic and runoff nitrogen loads are reduced independently, showed that hypothetical domestic wastewater treatment resulted in an improvement in simulated water transparency. The results suggest that domestic wastewater treatment should be a first priority for local administrations...|$|R
