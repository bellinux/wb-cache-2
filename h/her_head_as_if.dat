2500|$|Bodenheimer (1979, pp 299–300) {{believes}} that the narrator {{is interested in the}} psychology of her characters: their inner selves, how their contentious interactions with others subconsciously reveal their beliefs and how the changes they experience reflect their negotiation of the outside world. Matus (2007, pp.35–43) also focuses on Gaskell's depiction of [...] "interiority" [...] (the psychic process), expressed in dreams and trances such as Thornton's dream of Margaret as a temptress or the rioters' [...] "trance of passion". The phrase [...] "as if" [...] appears over 200 times, suggesting Gaskell's reluctance to appear too definitive in her narration (O'Farrell, 1997, p 16): [...] "Bessy, who had sat down on the first chair, as if completely tired out with her walk" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 11) and [...] " [...] spoke as if this consequence were so entirely logical" [...] (chapter 19). The phrase is primarily used when exploring the characters' sensations and feelings: [...] "As if she felt his look, she turned to him" [...] (chapter 22); [...] "He had shaken off his emotion as if he was ashamed of ever giving way to it" [...] (chapter 28), and [...] "She lifted up <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she took pride in any delicacy of feeling which Mr. Thornton had shown" [...] (chapter 39). Gaskell uses it when exploring the unconscious process that allows Thornton, whose suffering in love disturbs his composure and control of his feelings, to communicate with Higgins (Matus, 2007, p 40): [...] " ... and then the conviction went in, as if by some spell, and touched the latent tenderness of his heart" [...] (chapter 39).|$|E

60|$|Josie nodded <b>her</b> tousled red <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{the answers}} pleased her.|$|R
60|$|Poor little Charley looked round too {{and pretended}} to shake <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> there were nothing absent.|$|E
60|$|Her uncle still {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} her identity, and still talked over <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she did not exist.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Murdstone cast {{down her}} eyes, shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> protesting against this unseemly interruption, and with {{frowning}} dignity resumed: ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{listener}} bent <b>her</b> <b>head</b> aside, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{to catch}} the full meaning of what she heard, the shadows of deep reverence passing over a face that had so lately been smiling. After a pause, she audibly murmured the word-- ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Corney shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> mournfully, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> deploring {{the mental}} {{blindness}} of those paupers {{who did not}} know it; and thrusting a silver spoon (private property) into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin tea-caddy, proceeded to make the tea.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Nickleby shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and sighed, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{there were}} a good deal in that, certainly.|$|R
60|$|Nelly shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{in answer}} to her own {{thoughts}} while Harry was speaking, but when he ceased she congratulated him warmly.|$|E
6000|$|... "The poet's granddaughter!" [...] Mrs. Seal repeated, half to herself, with a {{shake of}} <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> that {{explained}} what was otherwise inexplicable.|$|E
60|$|Her {{hand went}} down to the hem of Katharine's skirt, and, {{fingering}} a line of fur, she bent <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to examine it.|$|E
60|$|She {{caught his}} hand in both hers, and bowed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> over it <b>as</b> <b>if</b> unable to finish her sentence.|$|R
60|$|In silence, {{without a}} word of thanks for this officious warning, Mdlle. Henri {{collected}} her books; she moved to me respectfully, endeavoured to move to her superior, though the endeavour was almost a failure, for <b>her</b> <b>head</b> seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it would not bend, and thus departed.|$|R
60|$|The {{housekeeper}} shook <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{and looked}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{she thought it}} in bad taste to mention the subject at all.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{the first}} {{compliment}} he had ever paid her, and she liked it, though she shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> disclaiming it, and answered brightly: ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{anticipated}} {{that she would}} laugh at me. No! She suddenly raised <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were looking at me intently in the dark.|$|E
60|$|On {{the island}} a thrush {{had begun to}} sing. Molly raised <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to listen. The water lapped against {{the sides of the}} canoe.|$|E
60|$|She dropped <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> ears {{had been}} {{opened to the}} voices of the world, she heard, beyond the rampart of sea-wall, the swell of yesterday's gale {{breaking}} on the beach with monotonous and solemn vibrations, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all the earth had been a tolling bell.|$|R
60|$|Now Lita {{seemed at}} a loss, and put <b>her</b> <b>head</b> down, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she {{expected}} to find her mistress where she had left her, somewhere on the ground. Ben called, {{but there was no}} answer; and he rode slowly along the brook-side, looking far and wide with anxious eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} and their eyes met. She had raised <b>her</b> <b>head</b> haughtily, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{questioning}} his right {{to speak to her}} in that manner, but as she saw the unspoken appeal in his eyes her own wavered and fell while a warm color crept into her cheek.|$|R
60|$|She did not speak, but bent <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{she were}} intent upon some work, and so seated herself that her countenance was almost hid.|$|E
60|$|She sighed--looked {{about the}} burial-ground nervously--shook <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the dreary {{prospect}} {{by no means}} pleased her, and disappeared round {{the corner of the}} church.|$|E
60|$|Zilia wrung {{her hands}} as he spoke, and drew her muslin veil closely around <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to exclude the sounds which excited her mental agony.|$|E
60|$|She {{returned}} {{silent and}} weak denials to his charges, and swayed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> desperately, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to thrust away {{the words as}} they came showering about her ears from the lips of the trembling man in the climax of life, with his bronzed Roman face and fine frame.|$|R
6000|$|... "I left my pore {{wife with}} 'er apron over <b>her</b> <b>'ead</b> sobbing <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> 'art would break," [...] ses Bob Pretty; [...] "not because o' {{the loss of}} the money so much, but to think of Henery Walker doing such a thing--and 'aving to go to jail for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>head</b> {{was turned}} away from me, a striped parasol leaned over her shoulder. With a faintly defiant tilt of <b>her</b> {{beautiful}} <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> exclaiming, [...] "See, Strangeness, I come!" [...] she stepped firmly on over the turf. A breath of some delicate indoor perfume was wafted across to my nostrils. I clung to my stone, watching her.|$|R
60|$|My aunt {{smoothed}} {{her dress and}} shook <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she smoothed defiance {{of the whole world}} out of the one, and shook it out of the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not half}} good and wise enough for that! Remember what I am," [...] began Ruth, bending <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the thought {{were more than}} she could bear.|$|E
60|$|Reminded of {{her former}} {{achievement}} in that way, Mr Flintwinch held the candle to <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had some idea of lighting her up for the illumination of the kitchen.|$|E

[...] And before he could question: [...] "Don't you feel by this time that there's nothing Susan Shepherd won't do for you?" ...|$|R
