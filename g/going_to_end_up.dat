500|$|Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson {{referred}} to audiences' Friday night plans away from television when he commented the episode was [...] "better than any movie you're {{going to see}} in the theater right now". Hanson thought the mystery produced [...] "surprises around every corner". IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, explaining he enjoyed the [...] "classic Fringe" [...] opening scene, the [...] "decent [...] job" [...] by Ruck, and John Noble's performance; he also thought the script was [...] "very clever [...] it reveals surprising story elements with innovative tricks". Isler wasn't sure what to make of the Bell-Olivia plot twist however, commenting that [...] "this new William Bell thing is either <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> as the best plot device of the season, or the cheesiest thing in recent sci-fi history".|$|E

Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, where are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>up?</b> You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place [...] The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Vig, Not Your Kind of People evokes ambient vibes of Garbage's {{first two}} albums, Garbage and Version 2.0: [...] "There's lots of {{elements}} of things we've always loved: noisy guitars, big electronic beats, atmospheric film moments", {{adding that the}} band [...] "wanted to make a record sound like something {{that we want to}} hear when we're driving the car." [...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs to blow out a little bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave a lot of the performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, we sort of throw paint at the wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and what we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> sounding like Garbage. I think we have a strong sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio. Much to our surprise there hasn't been another band like ours since we came off the road." ...|$|E

He says he doesn’t want to hire these people from Harvard or Wharton. They’re just like he was; they don’t have any interest in the knowledge and to me, he was sweet enough to say the Stanford students have an interest in knowledge, so we want to hire Stanford.

Though they changed certain aspects, they knew where Olivia and Peter were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> start and <b>end</b> <b>up</b> but [...] "got there at different paces than what [...] originally planned". While the first season both focused on Olivia and dealt with discovering the existence of an enemy, the second was designed to [...] " [...] to a very specific type of confrontation" [...] between the two universes. Explained Pinkner, [...] "Season 2 is about the people from 'over there' putting the final pieces of the invasion into play, and explaining why". At the same time, the producers approached the second season as a [...] "journey of self-actualization" [...] and [...] "maturation for our characters." [...] They wanted to make the three main cast members become more comfortable as a team in Fringe Division; Peter thus was written to be more heroic and to go from reluctance to a desire to help his father, while Walter became gradually more independent and [...] "grounded as a human being". They made the secret of Peter's origins one of the main story focuses of the season. While the audience had been made aware of Walter's secret in the season one finale, the producers wanted to [...] "acknowledge it to our characters". All the while Walter was [...] "suffering... and desperately trying to keep it all quiet", Olivia and Peter grew closer to the truth. By [...] "giv these things time" [...] to develop, Pinkner strove to avoid focusing just on [...] "event, event, event", instead concentrating on the real consequences of Peter and Olivia's eventual discovery.|$|R
