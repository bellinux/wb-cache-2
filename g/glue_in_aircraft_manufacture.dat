40|$|The {{aerospace}} industry is inevitably moving towards lighter, {{faster and more}} versatile aircraft, {{which has led to}} tighter manufacturing standards for both commercial and military aircraft. This has led to a wide use of automation for the <b>manufacture</b> of <b>aircraft</b> components. <b>In</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>manufacture,</b> the labour required for assembly procedures can account for as much as 50 % of the total cost of the assembly; drilling and riveting account for a large fraction of that cost. One of the areas of highest value added is in the drilling and trimming of aircraft parts. It is not uncommon for a wing, horizontal stabiliser or engine strut to have hundreds, even thousands, of holes to be drilled prior to installing fasteners. The material used in the manufacture of an elevator is very expensive; therefore the mistakes can be costly. So, many manufacturers have identified drilling as a candidate for automation. In most cases a robot or robot like machine will be used for this application. At present, the drilling of thousands of holes involves the frequent loading and unloading of drill guides and is done manually. This results in high labour costs. In this thesis, we will focus on the manufacture of elevators and investigate the possibilities of automating the drilling process associated with it. A simulation study was carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of robotic drilling. This study was carried out with the Interactive Graphic Robot Instruction Program software package...|$|R

40|$|Many {{changes have}} {{occurred}} in the past 20 years <b>in</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>manufacture</b> and development. New technologies have appeared, spanning the entire aircraft design environment, such as new production methods, new materials and new avionics systems. These new methods have been developed for two reasons. For military aircraft, they have arisen through the need to improve performance. However, for civil aircraft they have arisen through the need to reduce the overall cost. This report considers one aspect of these technologies for civil aircraft: fly-by-wire. This technology uses electrical signalling in place of conventional heavy mechanical control runs. In addition, flyby- wire generally permits improvements to be made <b>in</b> <b>aircraft</b> flying and handling qualities. This requirement has originated from two main sources; a need to make improvements in the light of an increasing amount of experience, and a requirement to cope with aerodynamic modifications which have been implemented to improve aerodynamic efficiency, but which have a deleterious effect on the aircraft's flying and handling qualities. Both of these adverse effects have come about from a desire to reduce costs for the end aircraft user, i. e. the airlines. The aircraft used for these evaluations is a Generic Regional Aircraft, of about 100 seats and a weight of 90, 000 lbs. Only a limited portion of the flight envelope was considered since these evaluations primarily concentrate on the approach and landing flight phase. These evaluations are being carried out as part of a joint Avro International Aerospace — Cranfield University Engineering Doctorate programme researching advanced flight control system design for a Generic Regional Aircraft. The overall aim of this programme is to produce a control law design which gives <b>aircraft</b> <b>in</b> question excellent handling qualities.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the past}} the BAM authors {{have shown that the}} {{parameters}} ultrasound velocity and attenuation are very sensitive to changes in polymer properties e. g. ultrasound cure monitoring of fibre reinforced epoxy materials <b>in</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>manufacture.</b> More recently, research work (EC Grow Project GRD-CT- 2002 - 000689) has concentrated on the characterisation of polymer materials for application in phased arrays also over a large temperature and pressure range (approx. 180 °C and up to 1400 bar). In the laboratory Dynamic Mechanical Analysis DMA is a well known and standardised technique employed to characterise the mechanical (modulus) properties of polymers. Similar to DMA, ultrasound can measure a dynamic modulus. In addition, ultrasound techniques have the advantage that they can be incorporated into the industrial process, are not confined to the laboratory and modern sensors can be employed over a practical temperature range. The objective of this research field is to increase the understanding of the sensitivity of ultrasound parameters to changes in the mechanical properties of polymers {{and at the same time}} increase the potential for practical application of such techniques. The elastic properties of a polymer can be characterised using longitudinal sound waves. It is principally possible to compare the temperature profile from the measured ultrasound wave modulus with the modulus (shear or Young’s modulus) from conventional low frequency DMA techniques, such as commonly employed to characterise polymer materials over a large temperature range. However, several additional factors such as measurement frequency, elastic modulus, physical polymer properties, temperature and their interaction must also be considered. In this presentation the link between ultrasound parameters and mechanical properties of polymer materials will be discussed and illustrated with the aid of practical examples...|$|R

40|$|Carbon fibre {{composites}} {{are increasingly}} being used <b>in</b> <b>aircraft</b> structures due to their superior physical and mechanical properties. The process of drilling of carbon fibre composites <b>in</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>manufacture</b> is economically important since the extremely abrasive nature of the fibres limits drill life. The hole quality produced by drilling in terms of fibre pullout and matrix cracking affects the notch sensitivity of the hole. The present thesis describes an experimental and analytical study of drilling of the carbon fibre composites carried out {{with the support of}} British Aerospace (Military Aircraft Division). Full drill life testing was carried out using four low cost commercial cemented carbide drills, three of which had brazed inserts, and drill life was determined by measuring the outer drill corner wear. Hole quality was measured in terms of diametrical tolerance using accurate plug gauges. Drill forces were measured using a two component Kistler dynamometer and attempts were made to measure residual stress in the workpiece using the birefringent photoelastic technique. The hole quality was related to drill wear, cutting forces and heat generated during drilling. Independent tasks were carried out to relate cemented carbide physical and mechanical properties to wear using several standard sliding wear experiments. Three different cemented carbide tool materials were investigated in terms of cobalt layer thickness, carbide distribution and physical properties including hardness and fracture toughness. Independent sliding wear tests were performed using a Pin-on-Disc machine, lathe and machining centre. These tests allowed the materials to be ranked in terms of wear resistance when rubbing against carbon fibre composite. The fracture toughness was measured using the techniques developed by Palmqvist. The wear resistance was correlated to the physical and mechanical properties of the tool materials. Hole quality was studied experimentally using scanning electron microscopy and fibre pullout shown to be primarily dependent on the fibre-matrix interface bond strength and the intrinsic strength of the fibres. The surface morphology of the fractured fibres in areas of fibre pullout showed inultimode damage due to anisotropy of the carbon fibre composite and the dynamics of drilling. The degree and pattern of damage developed in the drilled holes was found to be highly directionally dependent. The experimental results and theoretical analysis showed that the degree of hole damage depends not only on drilling parameters but also on the material composition and the manufacturing process of the carbon fibre composite...|$|R

Two examples, one on failure of bolt of main rotor blade fork of a helicopter, {{and the other on}} failure of a hydraulic pipeline of an aircraft, have been presented. In the first case, an incident of premature fatigue failure occurred in the blade fork bolt during service, involving fatigue cracking at the flange region of the collar close to the bolt-head. The fretting damage at the flange of the collar was associated with pitting, spalling and sub-surface crack generation at the flange-bush interface. In the case of hydraulic pipeline failure, fretting damage was observed between two titanium alloy tubes in contact. Study showed that the reason for setting-in fretting damage at the joint was due to inadequate closeness of the fit that was formed by swaging...|$|R
