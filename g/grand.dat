5|$|Exclusive Jurisdiction is {{a concept}} whereby only one <b>Grand</b> Lodge will be {{recognised}} in any geographical area. If two <b>Grand</b> Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other <b>Grand</b> Lodges will {{have to choose between}} them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the <b>Grand</b> Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate <b>Grand</b> Lodge. Other <b>Grand</b> Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two over-lapping <b>Grand</b> Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the <b>Grand</b> Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall <b>Grand</b> Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other <b>Grand</b> Lodges may recognise both).|$|E
5|$|Freemasonry, as {{it exists}} in various forms all over the world, has a {{membership}} estimated by the United <b>Grand</b> Lodge of England at around six million worldwide.

The largest single jurisdiction, in terms of membership, is the United <b>Grand</b> Lodge of England (with a membership estimated at around a quarter million). The <b>Grand</b> Lodge of Scotland and <b>Grand</b> Lodge of Ireland (taken together) have approximately 150,000 members. In the United States, total membership is just under two million.|$|E

5|$|Relations between <b>Grand</b> Lodges are {{determined}} by the concept of Recognition. Each <b>Grand</b> Lodge maintains a list of other <b>Grand</b> Lodges that it recognises.
