5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution. However, because {{of the differences in}} motion between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On <b>dry</b> <b>land,</b> a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only slightly more than a fifth of its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non-Laticauda sea snakes are virtually stranded on <b>dry</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E

5|$|Mating {{occurs on}} <b>dry</b> <b>land,</b> but the females {{return to the}} edge of the sea to release their fertilised eggs and then retreat back up the beach. The larvae that hatch are planktonic for 3–4 weeks, before {{settling}} to the sea floor, entering a gastropod shell and returning to <b>dry</b> <b>land.</b> Sexual maturity is reached after about 5 years, and the total lifespan may be over 60 years. In the 3–4 weeks that the larvae remain in the sea their chance of reaching another suitable location will be enhanced if they find a floating life support system. It is commonly agreed that floating logs or rafts of storm-struck vegetation would be suitable, although rather chancy and definitely seasonal. In contrast, floating coconuts can be a very significant part of the crab's dispersal options.|$|E

A study was {{conducted}} between 2010 to 2012 in <b>dry</b> <b>lands</b> (Miwaleni, Kiboko) and sub-humid (Ukiriguru) environments to identify parents for hybrid production. It involved 121 lines from ICRISAT and 121 hybrids developed from 36 male sterile lines and 42 restorer lines in a line × tester crossing. Experiments were planted in an alpha lattice design with three replications. Analysis revealed significant (P < 0. 05) differences between parents and between crosses for yield and yield components, indicative of potentiality for exploitation. Line IESV 23010 expressed best (- 6. 5) general combing ability (GCA) for days to 50 % flowering (DAF). Highest general combiner for height was - 55. 4 expressed in ICSR 24007 and for yield was 382. 8 expressed in IESV 92156 DL. The crosses SDSA 4 ×ICSR 43 and SDSA 4 ×ICSR 59059 exhibited high and significant specific combining ability (SCA) for DAF. Lines IESB 2 and ICSB 44 were suited to sub-humid, whereas BTX 623, ICSB 15 and ICSB 6 to <b>dry</b> <b>lands</b> environments.

5|$|Amplexus {{between the}} male and female occurs mainly in water, but {{sometimes}} at substantial distances away on <b>dry</b> <b>land.</b> Observations of breeding sites have shown the males linger around the courting area for much longer times, while females mostly stay at other places to find food before meeting the males there. During amplexus, the males grab the females near their armpits after climbing on their backs. In the wild, amplexus usually takes between 10 minutes and five days. Artificially induced amplexus in the laboratory has been observed to last 50 hours, but there have been reports of five days. Sometimes, amplexus will not result in eggs being laid.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480 BC) {{recognized}} that some fossil shells were remains of shellfish, which he used to argue that what {{was at the time}} <b>dry</b> <b>land</b> was once under the sea. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), in an unpublished notebook, also concluded that some fossil sea shells were the remains of shellfish.

5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus) {{is a small}} crocodilian from {{northern}} and central South America in the alligator family.

It lives in riverine forests, flooded forests near lakes, and near fast-flowing rivers and streams. It can traverse <b>dry</b> <b>land</b> to reach temporary pools and tolerates colder water than other species of alligator. Other common names for this species include the musky caiman, the dwarf caiman, Cuvier's caiman and the smooth-fronted caiman.

40|$|Many {{studies had}} been done about the {{distribution}} of halophytes (Tsuda 1947,Hatanaka 1956,Kuranari and Iwamura 1976, 1977,Iwamura 1987,Nakanishi 1989,Ejima et al. 1990,Takahashi et al. 1991). However, {{there have been a}} few study as to weeds invaded into the <b>dried</b> <b>land</b> after the reclamation (Kobayashi 1952,Jinno and Ida, 1988). Now, 3, 550 ha of a inner part of Isahaya Bay was closed for the reclamation in April 14, 1997. Since water level is kept at - 1 m of sea level standardized at Tokyo Bay, a broad <b>dried</b> <b>land</b> was emerged. As a desalinization was progressed, many spermatophytic plants (glycophytes), so called weeds invaded into the <b>dried</b> <b>land.</b> 14 study sites were set on the dreid land inside the bank, and investigations based on the relation between the flora and soil properties were done from July to August in 1977. Soil salinity was storongly desalinized at the mouth area of river, since soils of habitats was gravelly sand. Clayey soils were also considerably desalinized at sites where fresh water was lifted from a back creek by a lift pump. Then, many weeds grew on such sites. On the other hands, the desalinization of clayey soils near the bank already constructed, where the lift pump was not set, was progressing more slowly. Therefore, since the soil salinity was still considerably high, weeds did not grow except for halophytes, such as Suaeda japonica. Moreover, plants did not grow on reduced soils. 108 plant species including some halophytes were found. Plant species of high emergence rate were Sonchus oleraceus, Eclipata prostrata and Rumex japonicus etc. among plants investigated. Halophytes, especially those of the seashore did not spread so much on <b>dried</b> <b>lands.</b> Hereafter, I would like to study the succession of spermatophytes on <b>dried</b> <b>land</b> insidethe bank...|$|R
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} takes place mostly in fresh water, though the black stork may look for food on <b>dry</b> <b>land</b> at times. The black stork wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often {{alone or in}} a small group if food is plentiful. It has been {{observed}} shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) and bar-headed goose (Anser indicus). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E

5|$|It was {{believed}} throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that sauropods like Apatosaurus were too massive {{to support their}} own weight on <b>dry</b> <b>land.</b> It was theorized that they lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in swamps.

A study of diplodocid snouts showed that the square snout, large proportion of pits, and fine, subparallel scratches of the teeth of Apatosaurus suggests it was a ground-height, nonselective browser. It may have eaten ferns, cycadeoids, seed ferns, horsetails, and algae. Stevens and Parish (2005) speculate that these sauropods fed from riverbanks on submerged water plants.|$|E
