25|$|Chewing gum {{can come}} in a variety of formats ranging from 1.4-6.9 grams/piece and {{products}} can be differentiated by the consumers’ intent to form bubbles or the sugar/ sugarless dichotomy. Chewing gum typically comes in three formats: tablets, coated pellets, and sticks/ slabs. Bubble gum typically come in three formats as well: tablets, hollow balls, and cubes or chunks. Stick, slab, and tab gums typically come in packs of about 5-17 sticks and their medium size allows for softer texture. Pellet gums, or <b>dragée</b> gums, are pillow shaped pieces that are almost always coated. Packaging of pellet gums can vary from boxes to bottles to blister packs. The coating of pellet gum allows for the opportunity for multiple flavor sensations, since coating is done in a layering process and different flavor attributes can be added to various layers. Cube or chunk gums, which are typically intended for bubble blowing, are called cut and wrap gums as they are typically severed from continuous strands of extruded gum and packaged directly.|$|E

500|$|Before a meal, {{the stomach}} would preferably be [...] "opened" [...] with an apéritif (from Latin aperire, [...] "to open") that was preferably {{of a hot}} and dry nature: {{confections}} made from sugar- or honey-coated spices like ginger, caraway and seeds of anise, fennel or cumin, wine and sweetened fortified milk drinks. As the stomach had been opened, it should then be [...] "closed" [...] {{at the end of}} the meal with the help of a digestive, most commonly a <b>dragée,</b> which during the Middle Ages consisted of lumps of spiced sugar, or hypocras, a wine flavoured with fragrant spices, along with aged cheese. A meal would ideally begin with easily digestible fruit, such as apples. It would then be followed by vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage, purslane, herbs, moist fruits, light meats, such as chicken or goat kid, with potages and broths. After that came the [...] "heavy" [...] meats, such as pork and beef, as well as vegetables and nuts, including pears and chestnuts, both considered difficult to digest. It was popular, and recommended by medical expertise, to finish the meal with aged cheese and various digestives.|$|E
