ABSTRACT: Concrete shrinkage is a main concern of engineers due to its direct relation to cracking. Shrinkage and shrinkage cracks jeopardize durability and increase maintenance as well as rehabilitation cost. To enhance the durability, normally shrinkage reducing admixtures is used, but the chemical admixtures are not eco-friendly and economical. The chemicals are patented and manufactured in developed countries and soled to developing countries at exorbitant price. The manufacturing also emits toxic chemicals which significantly contribute to global warming. To alleviate this situation, research work was undertaken to determine the suitability of plant extract (Blue Gum extract) as shrinkage reducing admixture (SRA) for concrete. Extracts from the bark of blue gum tree was prepared by boiling the bark in water. Mortar slabs were prepared for different percentage of dosage and flow level, which were then exposed to the environment, thus permitting measurement of shrinkage and cracks for different times (5 hour, 3 day, 7 day & 28 day). Results obtained indicate {{that the use of}} Blue <b>Gum</b> <b>plant</b> extract reduced shrinkage and cracks due to shrinkage on cement mortar...|$|E

30|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>gums</b> are {{polysaccharide}} vegetable secretions {{that can}} be tapped from incisions in <b>plants.</b> <b>Plant</b> <b>gums</b> used for binding media are produced {{by a variety of}} trees and shrubs. Chemically they are high molecular weight polymers made of nine sugars: seven aldose (arabinose, xylose, rhamnose, fucose, mannose, glucose, galactose) and two uronic acids (glucuronic and galacturonic acids). The most widely available gums in ancient Egypt were acacia gum (from Vachellia spp. and Senegalia spp.) and gum tragacanth (from Astragalus spp.), while locust bean gum, tamarind gum and cherry gum have also been suggested [17]. Acacia gum is also known as gum arabic. The high solubility of this specific gum makes it particularly suitable as a painting medium. The use of <b>plant</b> <b>gums</b> as binding media appears to have been widespread in ancient Egypt based on several attestations: paint from stone columns and blocks in the Temple of Karnak {{from a wide range of}} periods (18 th Dynasty, 19 th Dynasty, Ptolemaic and Coptic) were bound with <b>plant</b> <b>gum,</b> possibly an acacia gum [27] and wall paintings from the 19 th Dynasty Tomb of Nefertari (QV 66) in Thebes were bound with acacia gum [6, 27, 28]. Gums were also used to bind most of the paints for the Nebamun paintings mentioned above. Although in most cases it was not possible to demonstrate the specific sources of the gum, at least one appeared to be from Acacia spp. and some others possibly from Prunus spp. [13]. Furthermore, the red wash of a 18 th Dynasty sandstone sarcophagus was found to contain monosaccharides, perhaps from gum tragacanth [27]. Polysaccharide gums were identified as binders in gesso layers in Egyptian cartonnages (c. 2160 - 2040 BCE) [29]. A recent study has identified the use of two different <b>plant</b> <b>gums</b> (locust bean gum and gum arabic) as a binder for the polychromy of an ancient Egyptian mummy shroud dated to the period from the 2 nd to the 3 rd century CE [27, 30].|$|R

40|$|A journal {{review of}} gums of {{industrial}} value. There {{is an increasing}} trend towards the use of available plant resources for food and technological applications. One class of ingredients often exploited for their texturizing capabilities are the plant polysaccharides called the hydrocolloids or gums. These compounds are long chain polymers which dissolve in water to give a thickening or viscosity-building effect. Some of these plant polysaccharides have found applications in the food, pharmaceutical, textile, mining and other industries. The United States Food and Drug Administration regulates gums, classifying these compounds as food additives. Though required at usage levels of less than two percent to achieve the desired properties in food systems, gums have become a big business. In 1991 the market of gums reached 126 metric tons at a worth of $ 748. 7 million. There is an increased awareness of the nutritional importance of polysaccharides. The demand for water-soluble polysaccharide gums including the seaweed extracts, seed <b>gums,</b> <b>plant</b> exudates and cellulose derivatives, has slowly increased {{over the past few}} years along with population growth and the advent of easy to prepare foods.

40|$|Our {{studies on}} the {{viscosity}} of macromolecular polysaccharides such as <b>plant</b> <b>gum</b> or <b>plant</b> mucilage relating to the industrial utilization of polyphosphates are interesting. Following these studies for gum tragacanth and C. M. C., now the similar studis for locust bean mucilage (gum), also known as carob bean gum were carried out using Stormer type rotational viscosimeter. Furthermore, instead of the previous measurements on the viscosity of ca. 3 % aqueous solution with the viscosimeter of the falling ball type, the present measurements on that of ca. 1. 5 % aqueous gum tragacanth solution with rotational viscosimeter are also canied out. The results obtained may be summarized in the following: (I) Effects of 5 sorts of polyphosphates such as sodium pyrophosphate, sodium tripoly phosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate and their mixtures on the about 1. 0 [...] 1. 5 % aqueous solution of locust bean gum as one of plant mucilage and on the about 3 % aqueous solution of gum tragacanth as one of <b>plant</b> <b>gum</b> are studied and the considerable increase of their viscosity are observed. (II) In both cases, each curve relating the viscosity-quantities added has maximum and the orders for the increassing effect with these polyphosphates resembled each other. (III) It appears that this increasing of the viscosity will be partly ascribed to the increased formation of aggregation of the linear negative ions and may be partly based on the untwisting of somewhat kinked linear macromolecule having many hydroxyl groups probably caused by the adsorption of these polyphosphate ions kindred with that group. 浅岡が従来行って来ている重合燐酸塩の利用に関連した多くの研究のうちで発表済のものは若千に過ぎない。しかしその中に高分子物質水溶液の粘度に対する添加物の影響の研究としてトラガントゴム水溶液についての報告があるので，ゴム類ではないが或意味ではこれと類似とも云える植物粘質物であるローカストゴムについて同様の実験を行ったものである。このローカストゴムは食品，化粧品，繊維加工，製紙，医薬用ゼリーなどの方面の用途が知られているので，これに対する添加物効果はその利用面からも主要である。更に既報ではトラガントゴム水溶液の粘度測定が落球式であったので，今回はローカストゴム水溶液と同じく回転粘度計によって測定可能の粘度まで低下させるために，前の約半分の濃度である約 3 %にして同種の実験を行ったものである...|$|R
