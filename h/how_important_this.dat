5|$|A large robotic craft arrives {{searching for}} Finn. When Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) finally {{encounters}} it, Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) destroys {{it with his}} fist. Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn a desire to discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea from whence the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, Marceline (voiced by Olivia Olson) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) off on their voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by Josh Fadem), who {{turns out to be}} rather annoying. BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on their boat, angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys their boat. This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers and take on the shape of a boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, {{below the surface of the}} water, a species of jellyfish latches onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains about wanting to return home, but Finn reveals <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>this</b> trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins to feel sorry for his actions; he then uses his powers to blow the group over the dangerous waters.|$|E

One of these glyphs refers to water and the cave contains an underground lake directly underneath the hill, making it likely that the toponym is referring to this particular body of water. The fact that the ElDuende group were originally named after this subterranean water source demonstrates <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>this</b> cave was to the ancient inhabitants of DosPilas.|$|E

A minor club, but also a club, {{which at the time}} was known to have a good {{education}} of young players, and Larsson has ever since he left this club, stressed <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>this</b> club has been not only for his football, but also for his adult life in general. In late 1991, he moved to Helsingborg (the main club of his home city), where he soon became the key player. Mats Magnusson did later join his new club, and after 24 seasons in lower tiers, the club returned to Allsvenskan for the 1993 season. Larsson continued there also for this season, but then moved to Feyenoord in November, staying for four years before leaving in 1997. During his time in the Dutch Eredivisie, he finished in third place at the 1994 World Cup with Sweden, alongside players like Martin Dahlin, Tomas Brolin, Jonas Thern, Kennet Andersson and Thomas Ravelli.|$|E

Adler said, [...] "I've heard {{from a lot of}} fans <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>this</b> character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted." [...] He wants Karofsky to [...] "accept himself and come out because [...] it would be a beacon of hope for everyone else who's struggling", and noted, [...] "people do get hope from Glee." [...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful.

We propose a composite measure of dollarization, identify its major trends, and ascertain its impact on the effectiveness of monetary and exchange rate policy. We find that, contrary to the presumption in the literature, a high degree of dollarization does not pose an obstacle to monetary control or to disinflation. A high level of dollarization does appear to increase exchange rate pass-through, reinforcing the claim that “fear of floating ” is a greater problem for highly dollarized economies...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is twofold: first, to discuss and explain the {{canonical}} correlations theory in simpler mathematics than the mathematics used by H. Hotelling—the originator of the concept; secondly, to show the application of this concept, in theoretical statistics, to the reduced form of the simultaneous equations, and in applied field, to an economic model. This way the concept—which is a generalization of the simple correlation coefficient theory—may become more well-known and popular. This simplification of mathematics of the concept shows <b>how</b> <b>important</b> is <b>this</b> concept in multivariate analysis {{as well as in}} applied fields...|$|R

2500|$|Writing to Piave, Verdi made {{it clear}} <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>this</b> subject was to him: [...] "....This tragedy {{is one of the}} {{greatest}} creations of man... If we can't make something great out of it let us at least try to do something out of the ordinary". [...] In spite of disagreements and Verdi's need to constantly bully Piave into correcting his drafts (to the point where Maffei had a hand in re-writing some scenes of the libretto, especially the witches' chorus in Act 3 and the sleepwalking scene), their version follows Shakespeare's play quite closely, but with some changes. [...] Instead of using three witches as in the play, there is a large female chorus of witches, singing in three part harmony (though it should be noted that they are divided in three groups, and that every group sings as a single witch, using [...] "I" [...] and not [...] "we"). The last act begins with an assembly of refugees on the English border, and, in the revised version, ends with a chorus of bards celebrating victory over the tyrant.|$|E

In Minahasa the natural docility and intelligence of the race have made their progress rapid; and <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>this</b> is, is well illustrated by the fact, that in the immediate vicinity of the town of Menado are a tribe called Banteks, of a much less tractable disposition, who have hitherto resisted all efforts of the Dutch Government to induce them to adopt any systematic cultivation.
