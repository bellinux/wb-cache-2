5|$|Julius Seelye Bixler {{reviewed}} the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review {{he wrote that}} he believed Stace was trying to have his {{cake and eat it}} with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> confessio fidei and personal statement. A year later, he reviewed Time and Eternity alongside Religion and the Modern Mind. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1950s, {{there has}} been a renewed {{interest}} in the collection of bookplates and in many ways a reorientation of this interest. There are still substantial numbers of collectors for whom the study of bookplates spanning 500 years <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> source of historical, artistic and socio-cultural interest. They have however been joined by a now dominant group of new collectors whose interest is more than anything the constitution—at quite reasonable cost—of a miniature, personalized art-print collection. In this miniature art museum, they gather together the works of their favorite artists. They commission numbered and signed editions of bookplates to their name which are never pasted into books but only serve for exchange purposes.|$|E

25|$|Recorded in {{the hills}} of Trinidad, here <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> {{juxtaposition}} of three music and music / dance practices of non-urban dwellers derived from African roots. Bamboo-Tamboo evolved out of the ban which European colonizers imposed on drumming: dry, hollow bamboo poles were cut to varying lengths to produce different pitches when thumped against the ground. These bamboo instruments are used to accompany or speak about calinda (stick fighting). Belair (bélé) is a dance of older women accompanied by drums and shakers, often danced all night long; whereas Kaiso, has its origins in West Africa and was brought over by the slaves who in the early history of the art form used it to sing about their masters.|$|E
25|$|Gouldian finches {{will usually}} make their nests in tree-holes, {{generally}} within a kilometer {{or so of}} water. They usually breed {{in the early part}} of the dry season, when there is plenty of food around. The male courtship dance <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> spectacle. When a male is courting a female, he bobs about ruffling his feathers to show off his colors. He expands his chest and fluffs out his forehead feathers. After mating, a female lays a clutch of about 4–8 eggs. Both parents help brood the eggs during the daytime, and the female stays on the eggs at night. When the eggs hatch, both parents help care for the young. Gouldian finches leave the nest at between 19 and 23 days and are independent at 40 days old.|$|E

500|$|Younis {{called the}} film a [...] "hodgepodge", saying it lurched from [...] "one sub-plot to another, while the really {{interesting}} material is submerged for significant periods". He praised the film's cinematography and art direction, though concluded the film [...] "undercuts the figure who most represented the creative individual.

500|$|A made-for-television film, {{directed}} by Richard Pearce, was produced and televised in 2001, starring Glenn Close as Nellie, Harry Connick, Jr. as Cable and Rade Sherbedgia as Emile. This version changed {{the order of}} the musical's songs (the film opens with [...] "There Is Nothing Like a Dame") and omits [...] "Happy Talk". [...] "My Girl Back Home" [...] was filmed but not included in the broadcast due to time constraints; it was restored for the DVD, issued in 2001. [...] The last half-hour of the film features scenes of war, including shots of segregated troops. Lovensheimer states that the film returned to the Michener original in one particular: [...] "Harry Connick Jr.'s Joe Cable <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> combination of sensitive leading man and believable Leatherneck".|$|E
500|$|Judith Fitzgerald of The Philadelphia Inquirer, who {{predicts that}} Street Gang will [...] become the {{definitive}} {{source of the}} show, calls [...] "a compulsively readable compendium of all things Sesame Street", as well as informative, heartbreaking, hilarious, and eye-opening". She credits its complicated and often funny story with the cooperation Davis received from Cooney when writing his book. [...] Fitzgerald also praises Davis, calling him [...] "a sensitive and subtly brilliant writer who conveys {{the soul of the}} program". [...] Reviewer Drew Toal calls Street Gang a [...] "swift narrative" [...] and [...] "a sensitive, honest account", and credits the large amount of cast stories and controversy recounted in the book with the hundreds of interviews Davis conducted. [...] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press states that the book <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> account of the creation of Sesame Street, and that Davis writes thoroughly and with affection.|$|E

500|$|Christopher Rosa from VH1 {{criticized the}} fact {{that none of the}} female singers apart from Rita Ora were {{actually}} present on set during shooting of the video; their parts were filmed separately. He added that it was [...] "pretty hilarious. Madge's clip is called, 'Bitch I'm Madonna', but why couldn't she get these youths to show the eff up?" [...] Writing for Life & Style magazine, Chantal Waldholtz was disappointed with the clip, calling it [...] "lackluster" [...] due to the short cameo appearances. Kevin Fallon from The Daily Beast called the video [...] "pathetic and sad" [...] and questioned the inclusion of guest stars like Swift's video, ultimately describing the whole affair as [...] "absolutely pointless. At worst, it's desperate. At best, it's just dumb... <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> mix of impressive and sad, both aggressively relevant and therefore wholly irrelevant at the same time." [...] He ended the review with one compliment about the single take in which the video was shot, comparing it to the 2014 black comedy film Birdman.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} met with largely {{positive}} reviews. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club wrote positively of the episode and awarded it an [...] "A" [...] grade. He noted the entries' similarities with [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", noting that both deal with men [...] "who [...] too much about death for [...] own good". He also praised the characterization of Scully and Fellig; {{he noted that the}} former is [...] "no-nonsense" [...] and optimistic, whereas the latter is a [...] "creepy man" [...] who is jealous of those who are capable of dying. Handlen concluded that the episode [...] "doesn’t play out like a classic monster episode, it feels like one". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, comparing it favorably to [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose". He wrote, [...] "If imitation is the highest form of flattery, what <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> offshoot of a previous incarnation? I'd say it looks a lot like the latest entry into Season 6 of The X-Files. The engaging 'Tithonus'." ...|$|E
500|$|Ann Hornaday from The Washington Post {{praised the}} film, {{describing}} it as enlightening and engaging. Francesca McCaffery of BlackBook {{commented that the}} film [...] "highlights the creative challenges of making art {{in a way that}} many documentaries often aspire to, but rarely achieve." [...] She also praised Leto's direction. Film critic Mike McGranaghan awarded the film three and a half out of four stars and wrote, [...] "Artifact <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> documentary because it pulls back the curtain on the music business." [...] He said that the film works both as an [...] "accounting of a good band making an album during a bad time" [...] and as an [...] "indictment of a business practice that screws the people who actually make the product." [...] Natalie Robehmed from Forbes stated that the film [...] "vitriolically breaks down what Leto considers to be grave imbalances, showing in one infographic how label contracts can result in bands accumulating debt with every release thanks to promotional costs, recording bills and advances record labels recoup." [...] Isabel Cupryn from Criticize This! gave the film four stars out of five and called it the Super Size Me of the music industry.|$|E

500|$|Though the coinage of {{the phrase}} [...] "punk rock" [...] is unknown, Dave Marsh was the first music critic {{to use it in}} print, when in the May 1971 issue of Creem he {{described}} ?and the Mysterians as a [...] "landmark exposition of punk rock". [...] Much of the revival of interest in 1960s garage rock {{can be traced to the}} release of the 1972 album [...] compiled by rock journalist and future Patti Smith guitarist Lenny Kaye. In the liner notes, Kaye used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] to describe 1960s garage bands and also [...] "garage-punk" [...] in reference to a song recorded in 1966 by the Shadows of Knight. [...] In the January 1973 Rolling Stone review of Nuggets, Greg Shaw commented [...] "Punk rock <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> genre... Punk rock at its best is the closest we came in the 1960s to the original rockabilly spirit of rock & [...] roll." [...] In May 1973, Billy Altman launched the short-lived punk magazine, which pre-dated the better-known 1975 publication of the same name, but, unlike the later magazine, was largely devoted to discussion of 1960s garage and psychedelic acts.|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review and awarded it three stars out of four. She called Scully's unhappiness with her situation [...] "understandable" [...] and positively critiqued Gillian Anderson, calling her performance [...] "wonderful". Vitaris, however, {{was critical of}} the [...] "Leonard Betts"/"Never Again" [...] switch, writing that [...] "nothing in this episode points to fear of cancer as Scully's motivation". She concluded, however, that [...] " [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> look at a whole new side of [...]" [...] Not all reviews were glowing. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, on the other hand, gave the episode a mixed review and rated it two-and-a-half stars out of five. The two were critical of Scully's behavior, noting that [...] "seeing Scully as angry and bored and believing her life is pointless isn't really Scully". They argued that Scully's belief that her life is boring is easily countered {{by the fact that}} [...] "she hunts fluke monsters, catches serial killers, and gets abducted by aliens". Despite this, Shearman and Pearson wrote that [...] "Gillian Anderson makes it work." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers also {{praised the}} game's varied {{scenarios}} and replayability. Dora from Jay Is Games praised the game, saying that [...] "with {{a huge amount}} of replay value, creativity to burn, and some of the most shocking plot lines you could ever hope to encounter, Hatoful Boyfriend <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> and surprising text adventure well worth checking out", though she also observes that [...] "the delayed payoff and the abruptness of some of the endings combined with the oddball concept may not appeal to every fan of the visual novel genre". Alexa Ray Corriea's Polygon review of the remake gave it an 8 out of 10, concluding that the [...] "witty dialogue and absolutely bonkers scenarios are genuinely fun to discover, and the handful of different storylines make repeated playthroughs worthwhile". Some critics however expressed concerns over the presence of some repetitive aspects of gameplay—noted as being especially apparent when attempting multiple playthroughs—as well as the accessibility of the game's Bad Boys Love scenario to casual players: in his review of the remake for PC Gamer, Julian Murdoch states that [...] "I suspect few will have the patience to ride the fast forward button and suss out the romantic proclivities of each cast member to get to the extended ending—really a second half—of the game".|$|E

She sees, and we see exactly what she sees. There is little attempt here to observe a plot. All the attention is on the handful of characters, on Johnny." [...] A.O. Scott in The New York Times called the film [...] "exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious" [...] and said [...] "This {{is not a matter}} of imitation, but rather of mastery, of finding — by borrowing if necessary — a visual vocabulary suited to the story and its environment. If you pay close attention, [...] "Somewhere" [...] will show you everything." [...] Peter Bradshaw disagreed in The Guardian, awarding the film two stars from five. He praised the cinematic technique but said that the film resembled Lost in Translation too closely, lacked emotional depth and that even on second viewing [...] "the question of why we should really care or be interested remains tantalisingly unanswered"; the final shot failed to solve any emotional problems and [...] "really is one of the daftest things I have seen for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|For Sony's OVAs of the franchise, {{there have}} also been {{multiple}} response. Matthew Anderson from DVD Vision Japan found the series' title [...] "Samurai X" [...] unfitting for Kenshin as the reviewer regarded the character as a hired killer rather than as a samurai as seen across the prequel OVAs. Rio Yañez from Animerica said one of the major themes of Trust is understanding the repercussions and after-effects murder can have, something that Kenshin has yet to comprehend though others have tried to point it out to him. Mike Crando from Anime News Network highly enjoyed Kenshin's characterization in the prequel as he refers it as [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> and emotional character study in its own right" [...] due to Kenshin's character development across these four episodes from [...] "an idealistic youth to a cold-hearted killer, only to be redeemed through love lost and the realization that swinging his sword is destroying his own life as well as {{the lives of the people}} on the receiving end". Additionally, the reviewer enjoyed the OVA's director's cut for showing more fights between Kenshin and Shinsenguimi, the special forces where Saito originated from. Earl Cressey from DVD Talk found Kenshin as a [...] "complex" [...] character and said his relationship with Yukishiro Tomoe might appeal the viewers. Carlos Ross from THEM Anime Reviews shared similar feelings and enjoyed the romance between Kenshin Tomoe despite its tragic outcome. Yegulalp from ThoughtCo. also listed the series as one of the [...] "Best anime romances" [...] with a bigger focus on Kenshin and Tomoe.|$|E
