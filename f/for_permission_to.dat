5|$|A Coast Guard {{detachment}} {{aboard the}} Fife confirmed {{that it was}} properly flying the U.S. flag. The Coast Guard was suspicious since the ship was low in the water, suggesting it was carrying heavy cargo, yet there were no cranes or other equipment that a legitimate fishing vessel {{would be expected to}} have. Instead there were several large shipping containers. Via radio, they asked the Joint Interagency Task Force West, a consortium of various federal law enforcement agencies, <b>for</b> <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> investigate further, since smugglers and drug traffickers were known to use that route.|$|E
5|$|A crypt was {{constructed}} beneath the former Chapel of St. Anthony in 2009 {{to house the}} remains of former Bishops of Hong Kong. This consists of two Vicar Apostolics, Timoleon Raimondi and Dominic Pozzoni, and all five deceased bishops—Enrico Valtorta, Lorenzo Bianchi, Francis Hsu, Peter Lei and John Wu. Bianchi's remains were interred later than the others {{due to the fact}} that he was buried in Milan.

5|$|After more arguing {{between the}} senior officers, {{they agreed that}} Khánh, Minh, and Khiêm would rule as a triumvirate for two months, until a new {{civilian}} government could be formed.

5|$|As the {{publication}} date neared, difficulties arose. In January 1869, Dallas asked Trollope <b>for</b> <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> defer serial publication by three months. As Trollope had {{agreed not to}} allow another of his novels to run serially {{during the first six}} months of The Vicars career, the editor's request would have diminished the author's income. Trollope initially refused, but subsequently agreed to a delay of two months, with publication to begin in early July.|$|E

5|$|Essential Media Entertainment and BBC Films {{initially}} developed Saving Mr. Banks as {{an independent}} production until 2011, when producer Alison Owen approached Walt Disney Pictures <b>for</b> <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> use copyrighted elements.
