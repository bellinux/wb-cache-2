40|$|BACKGROUND: The QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT) is {{a viable}} {{alternative}} to the tuberculin skin test (TST) for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. However, within-subject variability may limit test utility. To assess variability, we compared results from the same subjects when QFT-GIT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed in different laboratories. METHODS: Subjects were recruited at two sites and blood was tested in three labs. Two labs used the same type of automated ELISA workstation, 8 -point calibration curves, and electronic data transfer. The third lab used a different automated ELISA workstation, 4 -point calibration curves, and manual data entry. Variability was assessed by interpretation agreement and comparison of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) measurements. Data for subjects with discordant interpretations or discrepancies in TB Response > 0. 05 IU/mL were verified or corrected, and variability was reassessed using a reconciled dataset. RESULTS: Ninety-seven subjects had results from three labs. Eleven (11. 3 %) had discordant interpretations and 72 (74. 2 %) had discrepancies > 0. 05 IU/mL using unreconciled results. After correction of manual data entry errors for 9 subjects, and exclusion of 6 subjects due to methodological errors, 7 (7. 7 %) subjects were discordant. Of these, 6 (85. 7 %) had all TB Responses within 0. 25 IU/mL of the manufacturer's recommended cutoff. Non-uniform error of measurement was observed, with greater variation in higher IFN-γ measurements. Within-subject standard deviation for TB Response was as high as 0. 16 IU/mL, and limits of agreement ranged from - 0. 46 to 0. 43 IU/mL for subjects with mean TB Response within 0. 25 IU/mL of the cutoff. CONCLUSION: Greater interlaboratory variability was associated with manual data entry and higher IFN-γ measurements. Manual <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> avoided. Because variability in measuring TB Response may affect interpretation, especially near the cutoff, consideration should be given to developing a range of values near the cutoff to be interpreted as "borderline," rather than negative or positive...|$|E
40|$|The Department of Defense {{has issued}} a mandate aimed at {{improving}} its capabilities in determining the location, value, quantity, and condition of government assets. The mandate requires marking specified assemblies and components with a unique identifier using two-dimensional data matrix technology. Item Unique Identification (IUID), comprised of data matrix technology and the Unique Item Identifier (UII) data construct, was chosen to create a global standard for identification and because it showed promise in providing lifetime tracking of assets. Currently, Raytheon's implementation strategy to address the mandate has focused solely on compliance and does not aim to extract value from the IUID mandate or the UII construct. However there are many potential benefits of these capabilities. This thesis attempts to identify potential usage scenarios, determine if they are a worthwhile investment, and develop a more deliberate IUID strategy for Raytheon as a corporation {{within the context of}} the existing tracking and information landscape. It was determined that company wide pre-tax net savings of $ 10. 6 (5. 4) Million annually are possible from leveraging IUID technology in repair operations alone. (cont.) This study recommends a pilot program and if successful, to continue to leverage IUID in those repair programs with: more than 500 units processed annually, more than five workstations, and an IUID requirement in place. This study also recommends that Raytheon should not mark above contractual requirements but should encourage customers to implement IUID marking for high volume programs. This study led to additional recommendations for operations strategy at Raytheon. Automated rather than manual (keystrokes) <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> promoted in all operations; specifically in high volume applications. Raytheon should also make a practice of purchasing scanners that detect both bar codes and data matrices for all operations. Finally, the UII construct should be adopted in company wide operations independent of which technology (bar code, 2 D Matrix, or Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)) is used to read or deliver it. by Alexey Salamini.

40|$|Holmen Skog {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{forestry}} companies in Scandinavia and they depend heavily on a large network of forest roads for production and logistics in connection to their forestry operations. The company recently introduced a new system for planning of road management. The system will also be developed with the intention to facilitate the monitoring of actions performed by road contractors. This report will provide information to support future decisions regarding further development of the system, after its introduction. In addition to a presentation of results from interviews, the report also provides a smaller study of the different subjects associated with roads, process work and process development. The study is largely based on interviews with road contractors that perform work for Holmen Skog today. System suppliers and users, as well as analysts were also consulted. Contractors were interviewed at their workplaces while the remaining interviews were conducted via email and telephone. The interviews were designed based on the qualitative interview method, although some parts have elements of quantitative data collection. The interviewees were asked, among other things about the parameters they would like to have in a system for monitoring road contractors, how the system should be designed, and what kind of hardware they were most interested in. In addition, questions were asked about for how long <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed and how many tasks should be included in a system for monitoring road contractors. Results from the interviews show that many of the interviewees had similar opinions. In conclusion, a monitoring system should be based on simplicity and must be easy to understand. The system should not include too many parameters and the parameters included should be beneficial for either the contractors or Holmen Skog. Evaluations of the system are important to ensure that it works smoothly and it is important that the purpose of data collection is to make improvements through the whole organization. It is particularly important that the machine operators know the usefulness of the information gathered since they are responsible for much of the information collection. Regarding the design of the software, type of hardware, the number of parameters to be included in the system and the time allowed for entering data into the system, the answers from the interviewees varied. Respondents argued for their case and the results show many pros and cons associated with different choices. It will be up to Holmen Skog, preferably together with representatives from the contractors, to decide how the proposed system should be designed...|$|E
30|$|Especially {{for highly}} saline fluids, there is {{currently}} no parameter file or database which can be applied from scratch for all scale-forming minerals in low-enthalpy geothermal fields. Regarding some scale-forming sulphide minerals and heavy metal scalings, no thermodynamic data at all are implemented for high salinity.

40|$|Background: The {{provision}} of relevant clinical information on pathology requests {{is an important}} part of facilitating appropriate laboratory utilization and accurate results interpretation and reporting. Purpose: (1) To determine the quantity and importance of handwritten clinical information provided by physicians to the Microbiology Department of a hospital pathology service; and (2) to examine the impact of a Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) system on the nature of clinical information communication to the laboratory. Methods: A multi-method and multi-stage investigation which included: (a) a retrospective audit of all handwritten Microbiology requests received over a 1 -month period in the Microbiology Department of a large metropolitan teaching hospital; (b) the administration of a survey to laboratory professionals to investigate the impact of different clinical information on the processing and/or interpretation of tests; (c) an expert panel consisting of medical staff and senior scientists to assess the survey findings and their impact on pathology practice and patient care; and (d) a comparison of the provision and value of clinical information before CPOE, and across 3 years after its implementation. Results: The audit of handwritten requests found that 43 % (n= 4215) contained patient-related clinical information. The laboratory survey showed that 97 % (84 / 86) of the different types of clinical information provided for wound specimens and 86 % (43 / 50) for stool specimens were shown to have an effect on the processing or interpretation of the specimens by one or more laboratory professionals. The evaluation of the impact of CPOE revealed a significant improvement in the {{provision of}} useful clinical information from 2005 to 2008, rising from 90. 1 % (n= 749) to 99. 8 % (n= 915) (p<. 0001) for wound specimens and 34 % (n= 129) to 86 % (n= 422) (p<. 0001) for stool specimens. Conclusion: This study showed that the CPOE system provided an integrated platform to access and exchange valuable patient-related information between physicians and the laboratory. These findings have important implications for helping to inform decisions about the design and structure of CPOE screens and what <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> fields <b>should</b> <b>be</b> designated or made voluntary. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background EHR {{systems are}} widely used in {{hospitals}} and primary care centres but it is usually difficult to share information and to collect patient data for clinical research. This {{is partly due to}} the different proprietary information models and inconsistent data quality. Our objective was to provide a more flexible solution enabling the clinicians to define which data to be recorded and shared for both routine documentation and clinical studies. The data <b>should</b> <b>be</b> possible to reuse through a common set of variable definitions providing a consistent nomenclature and validation of data. Another objective was that the templates used for the <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> and presentation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> possible to use in combination with the existing EHR systems. Methods We have designed and developed a template based system (called Julius) that was integrated with existing EHR systems. The system is driven by the medical domain knowledge defined by clinicians in the form of templates and variable definitions stored in a common data repository. The system architecture consists of three layers. The presentation layer is purely web-based, which facilitates integration with existing EHR products. The domain layer consists of the template design system, a variable/clinical concept definition system, the transformation and validation logic all implemented in Java. The data source layer utilizes an object relational mapping tool and a relational database. Results The Julius system has been implemented, tested and deployed to three health care units in Stockholm, Sweden. The initial responses from the pilot users were positive. The template system facilitates patient data collection in many ways. The experience of using the template system suggests that enabling the clinicians to be in control of the system, {{is a good way to}} add supplementary functionality to the present EHR systems. Conclusion The approach of the template system in combination with various local EHR systems can facilitate the sharing and reuse of validated clinical information from different health care units. However, future system developments for these purposes should consider using the openEHR/CEN models with shareable archetypes. </p...|$|R
