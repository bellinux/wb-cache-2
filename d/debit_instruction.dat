50|$|To set up {{payments}} by Direct Debit, the payer must {{complete a}} Direct <b>Debit</b> <b>Instruction</b> to the merchant. This instruction contains bank-approved wording {{that makes it}} clear the payer is setting up an ongoing authority for the merchant to debit their account. The interface for completing the Direct <b>Debit</b> <b>Instruction</b> {{is controlled by the}} merchant, who then sends the data from the form to the customer's bank, via Bacs.|$|E
5000|$|A Direct <b>Debit</b> <b>instruction</b> must in {{all cases}} be {{supported}} by some sort of authorization for the payee to collect funds from the payer's account. There are generally two methods {{to set up the}} authorization: ...|$|E
50|$|A direct <b>debit</b> <b>instruction</b> {{differs from}} a direct deposit and {{standing}} order instruction, which are {{initiated by the}} payer. A standing order involves fixed payment amounts paid periodically, while a direct debit can be of any amount and can be casual or periodic. They also {{should not be confused}} with a Continuous Payment Authority, where the payee collects money whenever it feels it is owed.|$|E

5000|$|Direct {{credit and}} <b>debit</b> <b>instructions</b> are only {{available}} to institutional customers. Direct credit instructions {{are used for}} payrolls and other large scale regular payments. Direct <b>debit</b> <b>instructions</b> are used by insurance companies, utilities and other large organisations which receive regular payments. Although governed by APCA rules, the actual exchanges of instructions occur through bilateral exchanges. There is no central [...] "clearinghouse" [...] for bulk direct entry payment instructions.|$|R
5000|$|The service allowed UK retail {{banks to}} {{electronically}} request {{the transfer of}} direct debit and standing order payments arrangements, on behalf of new customers, wishing to transfer payment arrangements from a previous bank accounts. The scheme was {{also known as the}} Inter Bank Transfer of Direct <b>Debit</b> <b>Instructions</b> [...] service and is governed by BACS (also known as Voca), the UK's automated payments clearing scheme.|$|R
5000|$|Any direct <b>debit</b> <b>instruction</b> {{that has}} not been used to collect funds for over 13 months is {{automatically}} cancelled by the customer's bank [...] (this is known as a [...] "dormancy period"). This can cause problems when the mandate is used infrequently, for instance, taking a payment to settle the bill for a seldom-used credit card. If the credit card company has not collected a payment using the Direct Debit mandate for over 13 months the direct debit mandate may have been cancelled as dormant without the customer's knowledge, and the direct debit claim will fail.|$|E
5000|$|Reverse sweep (sweep-out): In case of {{shortfalls}} in {{the savings}} account to honour any <b>debit</b> <b>instruction</b> (e.g. when the customer wants to withdraw money through cheque or through ATM), {{the balance in}} the FD to the extent needed for meeting the shortfall is automatically withdrawn in multiples of Rs 1000 (or any other amount set by the bank). The remaining balance in the FD continues to earn higher interest at the original rate applicable to FDs. Hence in case the customer wants to withdraw more than what is deposited in the savings account component, the bank would withdraw money from the fixed deposit component.|$|E

50|$|This was {{followed}} in 2008 by the mandatory requirement for all new service users to use AUDDIS - {{a more efficient}} system for organisations to send new Direct <b>Debit</b> <b>instructions</b> to their customers’ bank, or building society, electronically instead of in paper format. In the same year, annual Direct Debit volumes surpassed the three billion mark and, by 2013, this figure reached 3.5 billion with 100 billion payments processed since 1968.|$|R
50|$|To prevent abuse, account holders must {{watch their}} bank {{statements}} and ask their bank to return unauthorised (or wrong) debit notes. As fraudulent direct <b>debit</b> <b>instructions</b> are easily traced, abuse is rare. However, {{there can be}} issues when the amount billed and collected is incorrect or unexpectedly large. There have also been cases of fraudulent direct debit where the defrauders tried to collect very small individual sums from large numbers of accounts, {{in the hope that}} most account holders would be slow to raise an issue about such small sums, giving the defrauders enough time to withdraw the collected money and disappear.|$|R
