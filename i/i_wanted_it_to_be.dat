So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very intimate, and it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E

And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E

In some versions of the song, the words [...] "muffin" [...] (being a slang term for the woman's vagina), [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "gun" [...] are censored out (bleeped). On June 21, 2009, the video won the Best International Artist Video at the 2009 MuchMusic Video Awards. The video received four nominations at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, in the categories of Video of the Year, Best New Artist, Best Female Video and Best Pop Video.

I wanted to show that, in theory, today one could follow the entire chain of record production, from start to finish, on his own. But in practice it is very different.

It's new,' and that's what I wanted. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very me, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, {{but also because of}} how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started.

It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy – I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} to be honest about yourself and things that affect you. It is a dance record, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> serious.

500|$|Malcolm Jones {{was shocked}} by what he {{perceived}} as the substandard musicianship on the Gilmour and Waters-produced songs, however: [...] "I felt angry. It's like dirty linen in public and very unnecessary and unkind..." [...] Barrett later said of the album: [...] "I liked what came out, only it was released far too long after it was done. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a whole thing that people would listen to {{all the way through}} with everything related and balanced, the tempos and moods offsetting each other, and I hope that's what it sounds like." [...] In a bid to increase sales, Jones wrote a letter to music magazine, Melody Maker, under an alternate name, writing how great the album was.|$|E

500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee.

But I feel like, by now, they know who we are, and I wanted something really different. I didn't feel like {{we had to put}} a photo on the cover, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|E

At the time, Zayat explained, [...] "If this horse {{was going to be a}} superstar, I wanted an appropriate name... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pro-peace, and about loving your neighbor." [...] Zayat also had difficulty obtaining the name from the Jockey Club, as it had been reserved by Earle I. Mack, who owned race horses and also happened to be the chairman of the board of Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, at Zayat's alma mater, Yeshiva University. After Zayat donated $100,000 to the school to [...] "promote peace," [...] Mack released his reservation of the name. But, in the first of Zayat's many racing disappointments, the colt's promising racing career was cut short by injury after two races.|$|E
5000|$|Lyrically, I Am Very Far {{is also a}} sharp {{departure}} from their previous work. Whereas previous albums were often composed of highly literate takes on rock legends and tropes, this album's lyrics tend to portray dark and indistinct dreamscapes. Sheff explained that [...] "interiority is a really important thing to me, {{and a lot of}} this record did come from a subconscious, unconscious place, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> respond to that corresponding place in listeners... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> really feel like it was operating on a subterranean level." ...|$|R

500|$|While Jones is {{credited}} with writing the screenplay, the shooting script was actually a collaborative effort that featured contributions from Henson, George Lucas, Laura Phillips, and Elaine May. Jones himself {{has said that the}} finished film differs greatly from his original vision. According to Jones, [...] "I didn't feel that it was very much mine. I always felt it fell between two stories, Jim wanted it to be one thing and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> about something else." [...] Jones has said his version of the script was [...] "about the world, and about people who are more interested in manipulating the world than actually baring themselves at all." [...] In Jones' original script, Jareth merely seems [...] "all powerful to begin with" [...] and is actually using the Labyrinth to [...] "keep people from getting to his heart." ...|$|E
500|$|A remix {{version for}} the song, [...] "Jackie's In Love In The Club Mix", done by DJ Jackie Christie, was made {{available}} {{as one of}} the exclusive tracks of the American and European maxi-single release of the song. She maintained Madonna's vocals and the gospel choir appearance, commenting that [...] "I was asked to remix 'Nothing Fails' [...] <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a mainfloor mix with a big choir breakdown so you felt the magic of the Madonna and the choir, like church." [...] Peter Rauhofer's remix of the song was added along with the remixes of the follow-up single, [...] "Love Profusion". Another version, the [...] "Jason Nevins Mix", was included on Madonna's 2003 remix album Remixed & Revisited. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic commented that on this remix, Madonna sounds as if she is {{out of step with the}} music of 2003.|$|E
500|$|Brooks {{discussed}} the cultural {{influences on the}} novel. He claimed inspiration from [...] (1984) by Studs Terkel, stating: [...] " [...] an oral history of World War II. I read it when I was a teenager and it's sat with me ever since. When I sat down to write World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the vein of an oral history." [...] Brooks also cited renowned zombie film director George A. Romero as an influence and criticized the Return of the Living Dead films: [...] "They cheapen zombies, make them silly and campy. They've done for the living dead what the old Batman TV show did for the Dark Knight." [...] Brooks acknowledged making several references to popular culture in the novel, including one to alien robot franchise Transformers, but declined to identify the others so that readers could discover them independently.|$|E

5000|$|The bulk of Is the Is Are was {{recorded}} in March 2015 at Strange Weather Recording Studio and The Bunker Studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Regarding the recording process, Smith noted: [...] "I didn’t <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> sound slick or over produced. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> sound human and homemade. And that’s the key <b>to</b> this album, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> show humanity, imperfect and flawed - the album title, the way <b>it</b> {{was recorded}}, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> every element to sound human, then hopefully people can empathise with me rather than judging me." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the song}} was directed by Matthew Rolston. Shot in New York City in early June 2002, behind-the-scenes footage of the shooting of the music video was released on June 7, and the main video officially posted on MTV on June 17. In the video, Jeremiah Alexis takes {{on the role of}} the bassist in the background and Beyoncé singing up-front, with the overall feel inspired by 1970s glamor and the introduction of pop and funk. On the concept of the video, Beyoncé said, [...] "I wanted it to look different from what we've done. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> raw. The look of it is like an old 1970's show." [...] Rolston stated that the video was inspired by shows like Sonny & Cher and The Midnight Special with James Brown, which took place around the beginning of the disco era and the end of the hippy era.|$|E
500|$|... "A Toast to Men" [...] was {{produced}} by Toby Gad, who contributed to the songwriting with Willa Ford and Rhonda Robinson. Tom Coyne served as the track's mastering engineer. The track features vocals by American rapper Lady May. Ford spent roughly two years working on material following the release of her debut album Willa Was Here (2001). The concept for the song was developed from her experiences at a sorority party. While discussing {{the inspiration for the}} single, Ford said that she heard girls at a sorority party doing a chant, and felt like writing a song using it. She was uncertain if her record label would release the song given its provocative content. When talking about her intentions behind the lyrics, she confessed: [...] "I was part of the revolution, as far as changing the way people think of pop music. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sexy and fierce and be OK to say the word 'fuck.' I just needed some time {{to get out of it}} and figure out what the fuck was going on." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{marks the}} end of Ugly Betty. ABC {{announced}} in January 2010 that the series' fourth season was to be the last, following falling ratings. In a joint statement Silvio Horta and ABC Entertainment president Steve McPherson said [...] "We've mutually come to the difficult decision to make this Ugly Bettys final season." [...] The network cut the episode order from 22 to 20, but gave the writers enough time to create a satisfying conclusion that was to air on April 14. On what he was set out to accomplish with the series finale, Horta said [...] "Primarily, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> about Betty's journey, about Betty making it in her professional life, first and foremost, overcoming the obstacles in her past and really succeeding". Vanessa Williams said the cancellation of Ugly Betty was [...] "devastating" [...] for the cast. She said [...] "Our cast was one of those rare opportunities where we love each other.
