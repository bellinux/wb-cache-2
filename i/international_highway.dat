5|$|Later, {{during the}} auto trail era, the modern US23 also {{coincided with the}} east branch of the Dixie Highway {{and part of the}} Lower Peninsula section of the Theodore Roosevelt <b>International</b> <b>Highway.</b> The Dixie Highway was created by William S. Gilbreath after he {{developed}} the Lincoln Highway. The highway was designed to link the Great Lakes with the Gulf of Mexico, and to commemorate a half century of peace between the North and the South after the American Civil War. At the urging of Governor Woodbridge Ferris, the northern terminus was located at the Straits of Mackinac. The highway had two branches in the Lower Peninsula; the eastern branch followed what later became US23 north of Standish. The Theodore Roosevelt <b>International</b> <b>Highway</b> was named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. In Michigan, it also followed US23 north of Standish.|$|E
5|$|NY37 was {{assigned}} in 1930 to {{the portion of}} the Theodore Roosevelt <b>International</b> <b>Highway</b> between Redwood and Malone as well as to a previously unnumbered roadway between Watertown and Redwood. The Redwood–Malone portion was originally part of NY3 when the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. NY37 has since been rerouted in areas, primarily near Ogdensburg and Massena.|$|E
5|$|The Theodore Roosevelt <b>International</b> <b>Highway,</b> a transcontinental auto trail {{extending}} from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, {{was established in}} 1919.

5|$|The {{hamlet of}} Port Kent and the {{connecting}} road were originally built in 1823. The village was planned {{to act as}} a source of labor for iron manufacturing and to provide for the industrial needs of Essex County. The hamlet grew and eventually became connected to Burlington, Vermont, via an hour-long ferry across Lake Champlain. The road that accessed Port Kent originally began in Keeseville, but became part of the longer Port Kent and Hopkinton Turnpike in the 1830s. The highway that is now NY373 was also designated as part of the Theodore Roosevelt <b>International</b> <b>Highway</b> in 1919.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} what became US2 {{was used as}} part of two Indian trails before European {{settlers}} came to the UP, {{and as part of}} the Michigan segments of the Theodore Roosevelt <b>International</b> <b>Highway</b> and the King's <b>International</b> <b>Highway</b> auto trails in the early 20th century. The state later included these trails as part of M‑12 when the first state highway trunklines were designated in 1919. Most of M‑12 was redesignated as part of US2 when the US Highway System was created on November 11, 1926. Since the 1930s, several changes have reshaped the highway's routing through the UP. One such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with Hurley, Wisconsin, and others pushed an originally inland routing of US2 closer to the Lake Michigan shoreline. With the creation of the Interstate Highway System, part of US2 was rerouted to coincide with the new Interstate 75 (I‑75), though in the 1980s, the U.S. Highway was truncated and removed from the I‑75 freeway, resulting in today's basic form.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, {{the segment}} of the Theodore Roosevelt <b>International</b> <b>Highway</b> within New York was {{designated}} NY3. At that time, it spanned the full eastwest length of the state, extending from the eastern bank of the Niagara River in North Tonawanda to {{the western edge of}} Lake Champlain in Plattsburgh; however, the routing through the North Country was significantly different at that time from its modern alignment. The route was moved onto its modern routing east of Watertown as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; it was truncated to Sterling on its western end and rerouted to follow its current alignment from Sterling to Watertown roughly five years later.|$|E
5|$|One Canadian auto {{trail was}} routed through the UP as well. In 1920, the King's <b>International</b> <b>Highway</b> linked Vancouver, British Columbia, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, {{but there was}} no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior. Motorists had to ship their cars by boat between Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to {{continue}} along the auto trail. The routings varied on the maps of the time, but its basic route used US2 through the UP from Ironwood to Sault Ste. Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960; by that time, the auto trail had taken on the Trans-Canada Highway name.|$|E
5|$|In {{the age of}} {{the auto}} trail, the roads that later formed US2 through the UP were given a few {{different}} highway names. When the original roadways between Ironwood and Iron River were completed in late 1915, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau (UPDB) named the area Cloverland and the highway the Cloverland Trail. Later the name was extended over the highway to Escanaba, and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s; the name was phased out by the UPDB completely in 1927. The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt <b>International</b> <b>Highway,</b> named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. Through the UP, the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US2, including the section through Florence County, Wisconsin.|$|E

5|$|NY3 {{originally}} {{followed a}} vastly different alignment {{than it does}} today. In 1924, it {{was assigned to the}} New York portion of the Theodore Roosevelt <b>International</b> <b>Highway,</b> an auto trail that extended from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon. In New York, it connected North Tonawanda (near Niagara Falls) in the west to Plattsburgh in the east via Rochester and Watertown. NY3 began at what is now the intersection of US62 and NY425 and followed modern NY425 north through Cambria Station to Cambria Center, from where the highway continued to Lockport on Lower Mountain, Gothic Hill, and Upper Mountain Roads and modern NY31. It remained on current NY31 through the city and mostly followed that route's modern alignment across western New York to the city of Rochester. The most significant exception to this was between Lockport and Gasport, where NY3 veered south by way of modern NY77 and County Route10 (CR10) to serve the hamlet of McNalls.|$|E

25|$|The direct {{predecessor}} to US1 was the Atlantic Highway, an auto trail {{established in}} 1911 as the Quebec-Miami <b>International</b> <b>Highway.</b> In 1915 it was renamed the Atlantic Highway, {{and the northern}} terminus was changed to Calais, Maine. Due to the overlapping of auto trail designations, portions of the route had other names that remain in common use, such as the Boston Post Road between Boston and New York, the Lincoln Highway between New York and Philadelphia, Baltimore Pike between Philadelphia and Baltimore, and the Dixie Highway in and south of eastern Georgia. North of Augusta, Georgia, the highway generally followed the Eastern U.S. Fall Line, rather than a more easterly route through the swamps of the Atlantic Coastal Plain.

25|$|A {{large portion}} of the western segment of US2, and a shorter piece of the eastern segment, follows the old Theodore Roosevelt <b>International</b> <b>Highway.</b> This auto trail, named in honor of the late former {{president}} and naturalist Theodore Roosevelt, was organized in February 1919 to connect Portland, Maine with Portland, Oregon. The route taken by this highway left Portland, Maine to the northwest, crossing New England via Littleton and Montpelier to Burlington. It crossed Lake Champlain on the Burlington-Port Kent Ferry and headed west across upstate New York, through Watertown and Rochester to Buffalo. After crossing southern Ontario, the highway re-entered the U.S. in Detroit, running northwest and north via Saginaw and Alpena to the Upper Peninsula, where it turned west along the northern tier of the country. This portion took the route past Duluth, Minot, Havre, and Glacier National Park to Spokane. In order to reach Portland, Oregon, the highway turned south in Washington via Walla Walla to Pendleton, where it headed west again via the Columbia River Highway to Portland. The last piece of the highway to be completed was over Marias Pass through Glacier National Park; cars were carried through the park on the Great Northern Railway until 1930.|$|E
500|$|The {{portion of}} NY37 from Redwood to Malone was {{originally}} {{part of the}} Theodore Roosevelt <b>International</b> <b>Highway,</b> an international auto trail connecting Portland, Maine, on the Atlantic Ocean coast to Portland, Oregon, east of the Pacific Ocean. When {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the entirety of the Roosevelt Highway in New York was designated NY3. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY3 was rerouted to follow its current routing between Watertown and Plattsburgh. The former routing of NY3 along the St. Lawrence River became part of the new NY37, which utilized a previously unnumbered highway between Watertown and Redwood via Theresa. Initially, NY37 directly served Theresa by way of modern CR136, CR46, and CR193; however, it was realigned [...] to bypass the village to the west.|$|E

500|$|The two {{industrial}} revolutions {{first and}} second combined with advancements made {{during the war years}} resulted in the largest impetus in highway construction of all weather roads following World War II. [...] The creation of the highway south of Chamberlain to Moose Jaw was completed in 1953. Paving projects followed within a short time period. [...] In 1955 parts of Highway 2 were already paved; Between Vantage and Tuxford, either side of Moose Jaw; north of Watrous along the Little Manitou Lake shoreline; and north of the junction with Highway 27 to Montreal Lake, either side of Prince Albert. In 1956 a North-South <b>International</b> <b>Highway</b> proposal regarding a highway between El Paso, Texas, and LaRonge via Wakaw was discussed. The CanAm Highway northern segment into La Ronge finished construction in 1977; however, the CanAm didn't go through Wakaw, rather it comprised several different routes making the CanAm. Highway 2, which does go through Wakaw, does link to the CanAm highway at Prince Albert when Highway 2 becomes the last portion of the CanAm highway. In 1952, Highway 2 was re-routed; rather than winding its way through the town of Wakaw, the highway's new route went straight along the western limit of town.|$|E
