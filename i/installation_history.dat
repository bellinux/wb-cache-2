40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss the role that {{tangible}} artefacts {{in the context of}} an interactive installation have as mediators between the physical experience of an open-air museum and the layer of digital information that is available to visitors about the site. We refer to the case study of an installation – Reminisce – designed for an Irish open-air museum, Bunratty Folk Park, where participants could follow trails around the site on the footsteps of characters from Ireland's past. At different historic houses, visitors could collect ‘tokens’ related to the characters both in digital and physical form: audio recordings of personal memories downloaded to a smart phone application, and physical objects representing aspects of the characters' lives. We discuss the role that the tangible artefacts had in bridging the digital and physical spaces of the installation, as well as extracting recommendations for designing <b>installations</b> in living <b>history</b> sites.

50|$|Women & Spirit: Catholic Sisters In America {{reveals the}} history {{of a small group of}} {{independent}} American women who helped shape the nation’s social and cultural landscape. Over the last 300 years, the sisters built and managed schools, hospitals, orphanages and other social institutions that have endured during eras when most women had few—if any—professional opportunities. As inspirational trailblazers, they corresponded with President Thomas Jefferson, talked down bandits and roughnecks in the Wild West and provided the first form of health insurance to Midwestern loggers. As an overlooked part of history, they played instrumental roles in significant American turning points—from the Civil War, Gold Rush and San Francisco Earthquake to the Depression, Civil Rights Movement and Hurricane Katrina.

40|$|Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved. Unauthorised {{reproduction}} prohibited. As {{a collection}} of British colonies and then a nation, Australia came into existence {{as a product of}} both colonialism and modernity; proud of its fancied youth and eager for the fruits of civilisation, enamoured with progress yet yearning for tradition. Historical accounts of Australia have equally been products of colonialism and modernity. More often than not, the mission of history has been to remember the triumph of colonising a continent and forming a modern nation state with destiny on its side. While the historical legacies of colonialism and modernity remain palpable, many of the dreams of colonialism and modernity lie in ruins. This is a book from these 'ruins' {{in the sense that it}} discusses both the colonial past of former colonies and the colonising of indigenous people in Australia. But ruins are never simply gone or in the past; ruins are enduring traces; spaces of romantic fancies and forgetfulness where social memories imagine the persistence of time in records of destruction. Thus this book is about the past in the present, it is written from within contemporary cultures of history. It moves from Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal accounts of Captain Cook, jumps to the <b>installation</b> of <b>history</b> in museums and school curricula, glides through the historiography of archetypal historical events. This is a book with strong hopes for history and social memory. My interest is not in hammering home the constructedness of history, nor in the important task of diversifying and proliferating accounts of neglected historical actors but in thinking historically about existing social memory. It is a gesture towards learning to inhabit landscapes of memory which are, in part, landscapes littered with ruins; some archaic and others nightmarish, some quaint simulations and others desperate echoes. I imagine such a landscape of memories not as homeless place for lost souls but a ground from which new flights of historical imagination might depart and to which they might return, differently.

40|$|In {{this essay}} I analyze how, within {{the space of}} the museum, recent media {{installations}} by Albanian artists Helidon Gjergji, Adrian Paci, and Anri Sala appropriate, and critically engage with, multiple narratives about migration in Italy produced and circulated {{over the past two decades}} across various media, with particular attention to the Albanian case. The imaginary and material sites the spectator traverses in Gjergji’s, Paci’s, and Sala’s installations open up space for a new audiovisual discourse, one that is still indebted to, and yet distinct from, the televisual and the cinematographic, as it emerges from the double relationship between on-screen and off-screen space, as well as between collective and personal <b>history.</b> <b>Installation</b> in the museum thus produces a transmedia memory, which simultaneously criticizes the televisual reality effect as well as Italian progressive representations of the Albanian migrant as a screen onto which Italians can project their own history of emigration, as is the case with Oliviero Toscani’s advertising campaign Boat for Benetton (1992) and Gianni Amelio’s feature film Lamerica (1994). Drawing on the scholarship on self-reflexive spectatorship by Elizabeth Cowie and Catherine Fowler, among others, I analyze how these Albanian artists invite the spectator to explore the virtual space on screen, the material space off screen, and the screen itself as an object, in order to prompt a different identification with the migrant figure in Italy...|$|R
40|$|Mapping is a {{fundamental}} way of converting personal knowledge to transmittable knowledge and maps are unique {{in the way they}} use space to represent space. Maps are selective in what they choose to represent, seductive in their contours and calligraphic marks and powerful in their ability to locate, describe, demarcate and ground. I will present a visually rich journey through the work of contemporary artists who use stitching and weaving to map both literal and metaphorical terrains in a textile space. Among the artists we will look at are:• Linda Gass, whose stitched topographic reliefs are at once descriptive aerial views of a landscape and commentaries on waterresource management in the West;• Tilleke Schwarz, whose embroidered drawings map a personal and eccentric space which is created by an intuitive meandering;• Jessica Rankin, who explores mental landscapes with fragments of scientific mappings such as astronomy, physics and genetics indelicate traceries on organza; and• Ismini Saminidou, whose woven <b>installation</b> maps the <b>history</b> of the Jerwood Space in London, from its origins as a Victorian schoolto its current incarnation as a contemporary arts center. We will consider how these haptic maps mark (and transcend) borders and boundaries, how they create (and subvert) order, and how repetitive actions of stitching and weaving infuse these maps with a particular intensity, and I will situate my own work, a stitched, drawn and digitally imaged cartography of the (physical and psychological) state where I live, within this vibrant and diverse contemporary practice...|$|R
