5|$|In {{spite of}} their mutual dislike, the Electress and Violante Beatrice {{attempted}} to improve Gian Gastone's poor public image together. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died; it was a rarity {{for the public to}} see him. To dispel the said rumours, the Electress compelled him to make an appearance—his last one—in 1729, on the feast day of the patron saint of Florence, John the Baptist. The Ruspanti, Gian Gastone's morally corrupt entourage, hated the Electress; and she, them. Violante Beatrice tried to withdraw the Grand Duke from their sphere of influence by organising banquets. His conduct at these literally sent those in attendance scrambling for their carriages: he vomited repeatedly into <b>his</b> <b>napkin,</b> belched and told rude jokes. These distractions ceased upon Violante Beatrice's death in 1731.|$|E
5|$|Governor Violante Beatrice and the Dowager Electress, {{following}} the former's sojourn in Rome, {{in spite of}} their mutual dislike of each other, attempted to ameliorate Gian Gastone's decadent public image together. Violante Beatrice organised banquets to remove him from the sway of the Ruspanti. His behaviour at these sent guests running for their carriages: he vomited into <b>his</b> <b>napkin,</b> wiped his mouth with his peri-wig and told rude jokes. These parties ceased when Violante Beatrice died, in 1731; Gian Gastone was devastated by the loss of his beloved sister-in-law. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died, as the public never saw him. To discredit these, the Dowager Electress induced Gian Gastone to make a public appearance—his final one—on Saint John the Baptist's day of 1729. An alcoholic, Gian Gastone drank too much before the ceremony and vomited repeatedly throughout; he had to be carried unconscious back to the Palazzo Pitti, the royal palace, on a litter. A sprained ankle incurred in July 1729 left the Grand Duke bed-ridden for—barring two occasions—the rest of his life.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the Muriel McBrien Kauffman Foundation {{purchased}} an 18.5-acre {{plot of land}} {{just south}} of the central business district. The Foundation announced that this site would be the home of the proposed performing arts center. By 2000, the then-named Metropolitan Kansas City Performing Arts Center board had narrowed down the pool of potential architects to four. They ultimately chose Moshe Safdie, an award-winning modernist known for such buildings as Habitat 67 in Montreal, Canada; the Khalsa Heritage Centre in India; the Marina Bay Sands resort in Singapore; and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. Soon after, he arrived in Kansas City to see the site for himself, and while at dinner with Julia Irene Kauffman he sketched an idea for the center on <b>his</b> <b>napkin.</b> Soon, that sketch would evolve into an architectural icon and the home for performing arts in Kansas City.|$|E

25|$|It is {{said that}} in a soy sauce shop long ago, in Totsuka-juku of the 53 Stations of the Tōkaidō (now Totsuka-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture), it {{sometimes}} happened that napkins would disappear in the night one by one. One night, when the proprietor of the soy sauce shop went out on a job, he heard some bustling music from {{a place where there}} should have been no people around. When he looked, there were several cats gathered, and there in the center was a strange sight: the shopkeeper's pet cat, wearing a napkin on its head and dancing. That explained why <b>his</b> <b>napkins</b> had been going missing.|$|R

5000|$|Catullus 12 is {{a poem by}} the Roman poet Catullus. In it, he chides Asinius Marrucinus for {{stealing}} one of <b>his</b> <b>napkins,</b> calling it uncouth and noting the disapproval of his brother, Pollio. Note the reversal of the praenomen and nomen in the first line. While [...] "Asini Marrucine" [...] could be translated simply as [...] "Asinius Marrucinus", the inverted word order introduces the alternative meaning [...] "Marrucinus son of a jackass". Napkins in Ancient Rome were handmade and therefore far more valuable than they are today; also, Catullus has a sentimental attachment to the napkins, as they were a gift from two close friends, Fabullus and Veranius. In comparison to Catullus' other invective poetry, this is relatively light: the main point of the poem could be to praise Pollio rather than to chide Marrucinus.|$|R

60|$|However, his was not {{a nature}} to show timidity, and taking a seat he calmly spread <b>his</b> damp <b>napkin</b> on <b>his</b> knee and gave his order to the colored waiter (the Palace Hotel had the only two colored waiters in Wagon Wheel) with such grace as he could command after long years upon the trail.|$|R

6000|$|But {{there was}} no arresting this last {{outbreak}} of Benham's all too impatient kingship. He pushed aside a ducking German waiter who was peeping through the glass doors, and rushed out of the hotel. With a gesture of authority he ran forward {{into the middle of}} the street, holding up his hand, in which he still held <b>his</b> dinner <b>napkin</b> clenched like a bomb. White believes firmly that Benham thought he would be able to dominate everything. He shouted out something about [...] "Foolery!" ...|$|R

2500|$|An unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exupéry had {{for many}} years sketched little people on <b>his</b> <b>napkins,</b> tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined {{notebooks}} and other scraps of paper. Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged {{in a variety of}} tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in Robert Crumb's later famous Keep On Truckin' of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office. Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as [...] "...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... his boy Saint-Exupéry came to think of as [...] "the little prince," [...] and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet." [...] His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exupéry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a [...] "realistic ideal". Saint-Exupéry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source. [...] One [...] "most striking" [...] illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exupéry's editing process.|$|R

Charterson surveyed her through an immense pause open-mouthed; then he turned his large now frozen amiability upon his host.

5000|$|The second verse {{features}} Atkins {{singing in}} a movie theater beside the screen showing the couple, and the wife placing a napkin in her husband's hand. The husband gives her a ring, but the wife leaves the room afterwards. The husband is then seen putting more souvenirs in a box. He is then sitting on a staircase, opening up the <b>napkin</b> <b>his</b> wife gave him, and finds the words, [...] "Honesty, Sincerity, Tenderness, Trust" [...] written on it. The husband kisses his wife while giving her a makeover. The wife is still watching the tape, as her husband gets off the staircase and takes the napkin with him.|$|R

He left the room, {{and went through the}} bar, and as he passed out along the hall, he found Dan Stringer with his hat on talking to the waiter. The waiter immediately pulled himself up, and adjusted <b>his</b> dirty <b>napkin</b> under <b>his</b> arm, after the fashion of waiters, and showed that he intended to be civil to the customers of the house. But he of the red nose cocked his hat, and looked with insolence at Mr. Toogood, and defied him. [...] "There's nothing I do hate so much as them low-bred Old Bailey attorneys," [...] said Mr. Dan Stringer to the waiter, in a voice intended to reach Mr. Toogood's ears. Then Mr. Toogood told himself that Dan Stringer was not the thief himself, and that it might be very difficult to prove that Dan had even been the receiver of stolen goods. He had, however, no doubt in his own mind but that such was the case.|$|R

The truth is, as I believe I have since found out, {{that they have no}} barber shops worthy of the name in Paris--and no barbers, either, for that matter. The impostor who does duty as a barber brings <b>his</b> pans and <b>napkins</b> and implements of torture to your residence and deliberately skins you in your private apartments. Ah, I have suffered, suffered, suffered, here in Paris, but never mind--the time is coming when I shall have a dark and bloody revenge.

60|$|He was ill and lonely. For {{many years}} he had been lonely, and for two years ill; but as he had smoked his first cigar, so he would live his life-stoutly, to its predestined end. Every day he was driven to the club; sitting forward on the spring {{cushions}} of a single brougham, {{his hands on his}} knees, swaying a little, strangely solemn. He ascended the steps into that marble hall--the folds of his chin wedged into the aperture of his collar--walking squarely with a stick. Later he would dine, eating majestically, and savouring his food, behind a bottle of champagne set in an ice-pail--his waistcoat defended by a <b>napkin,</b> <b>his</b> eyes rolling a little or glued in a stare on the waiter. Never did he suffer his head or back to droop, for it was not distinguished so to do.|$|R
