40|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a {{satellite}} based navigation system. GPS satellites transmit signals that allow one to quite accurately estimate {{the location of}} GPS receivers. In GPS a typical technique for kinematic position estimation is differential positioning where two receivers are used, one receiver is stationary and its exact position is known, the other is roving and its position is to be estimated. We describe the physical situation and give the mathematical model based on the difference of the measurements at the stationary and roving receivers. The model we consider combines both the code and carrier phase measurements. We then present a recursive least squares approach for position estimation. We take full account {{of the structure of}} the problem to make our algorithm efficient, and use orthogonal transformations to ensure numerical reliability of the algorithm. Real data test results suggest our algorithm is <b>effective.</b> An <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> of this approach is that the drawbacks of double differencing are avoided. The paper could also serve as a straightforward introduction for numerical analysts to an interesting area of GPS...|$|R

However, a recent systematic review indicates that there is modest evidence supporting the <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> of motor imagery compared to only conventional physiotherapy in patients with stroke. These authors concluded that motor imagery appears to be an attractive treatment opinion, easy to learn and to apply and the intervention is neither physically exhausting nor harmful. Therefore, motor imagery may generate <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> for patients.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-inferiority (NI) {{trials in}} drug {{research}} {{are used to}} demonstrate that a new treatment is not less effective than an active comparator. Since phase IV trials typically aim at informing a clinical decision, {{the value of a}} phase IV non-inferiority trial hinges also on its clinical relevance. In such trials, clinical relevance would refer to the added benefit claims of a specific drug, apart from efficacy, relative to its comparator drug in the trial. METHODS: In this study, we reviewed 41 phase IV trials and extracted information on whether the authors mentioned any <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> beyond the NI (efficacy) claim of the drug and whether the <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> was proven in the trial. We checked whether the additional claim was based on descriptions only or on formal statistical analyses. RESULTS: Our results showed that 22 out of the 41 NI trials mentioned <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> of the test drug and most of these claims were related to the safety profile. Of all the post-authorization NI trials that claimed <b>additional</b> <b>benefit,</b> 10 out of 22 NI trials used formal statistical analyses to show <b>additional</b> <b>benefit,</b> and only one included a sample size calculation for the <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> prior to the trial. CONCLUSION: We conclude that there is room for improvement in terms of designing phase IV NI trials with added benefit claims and in proving these additional claims...|$|R

40|$|Background: Topical microbicides {{against the}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) 1 that are nonirritating to the female genital epithelium are urgently needed to slow the heterosexual spread of HIV infection. Products that are also <b>effective</b> contraceptives provide <b>additional</b> <b>benefits.</b> Cellulose sulfate (CS) is a noncytotoxic antifertility agent that exhibits in vitro antimicrobial activity against sexually transmitted pathogens, including HIV. Methods: We performed a multicenter, Phase I, placebo-controlled, randomized study to evaluate the genital toxicity of CS. Two cohorts of healthy women used 3. 5 ml of 6 % CS gel or 3. 5 ml of K-Y Jelly, vaginally, bid, for 14 days. The first cohort was sexually abstinent, and the second cohort was sexually active. Results: CS was associated with only a slightly higher odds ratio (OR) of symptoms of minor urogenital irritation compared to the inactive lubricant K-Y Jelly (OR= 2. 02, 95 % confidence interval= 0. 90 - 4. 53). In addition, there were minor shifts in some genital flora, {{but there was no}} evidence of greater inflammation as evidenced by few colposcopic findings, decreased influx of polymorphonuclear cells and minimal changes in proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, both products appeared acceptable to most women. Product leakage was identified as more of a problem in sexually abstinent women, but less so in women using the product for sexual intercourse, as would be the case in actual practice. Conclusion: CS was safe for twice-daily use for 14 days. CS is appropriate for future studies in effectiveness trials. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
