50|$|The {{realistic}} {{aspects of}} the novel are presented through conversations, which in its inherence and vigor provide an individuality to the story. Dr. George Irumbayam is of {{the view that the}} romantic elements in the novel are intertwined with the realistic legibility of historical elements. The honest behavior of Mangoikkal Kuruppu to the prince, the anxious preparations of Karthyayani Amma to receive Padmanabhan Thambi, short-tempered reactions of Shanku Assan represent realistic aspects in the novel. N. Balakrishnan Nair states that the novel is a love story built around a serious period in the history of Travancore. The romance of Ananthapadmanabhan and Parukutty is presented as a supporting aspect to heroism in the novel, according to Dr. Poojapura Krishnan Nair. Ayyappa Paniker states that the romance between Ananthapadmanabhan and Parukutty gives a soul and emotional angle to the historical and political themes of the novel. According to Dr. George Irumbayam, the historical plot about power struggle between Marthanda Varma and rebels is presented as rich and active through the love story of Ananthapadmanbhan and Parukutty. The <b>emotional</b> <b>factor</b> of the novel is further emphasized with another plot of romance involving Ananthapadmanabhan with the unrequited love of Zulaikha, there by making the love story to be a triangular one. The story of Subhadra is also considered as a tragic love story, which strengthens the romantic {{aspects of the}} novel. The love failures of Subhadra and Zulaikha aid in creating a favorable surrounding for the romantic aspects of the novel. Dr. D. Benjamin remarks that the very first instance of romantic love is in this novel. The longing of Parukutty for the return of her lover, Zulaikha's love failure are seen as reminiscences of romantic love, and latter is considered as foremost romantic heroine of Malayalam literature in romanticism. The romantic aspects similar to that in Prometheus Unbound and in the apocalyptic poetry of William Blake are identified in the personality of Subhadra, with which the character coveys a conflict-oriented complexity of multi-colored romanticism.|$|E

We’ve used two cognitive tests and many data on the scientific literature were collected in order to help and check whether the method is valid or not. The results confirmed and showed us that the <b>emotional</b> <b>factor</b> is always together with the executives, and in different ways, which has an effect on the BDP (business decision-making process). We could create an Emotion’s Indicator (E.

However, not all piano players and song writers are gifted with the musical talent of harmonizing piano melodies effectively since it requires keeping track of an extensive set of western music rules and concepts, years of training and practice and also musicality within them to harmonize a melody accurately. This paper discusses a solution for the tedious task of harmonization by introducing `ChordATune', an interactive tool for harmonizing melodies and generating chord progressions according to user emotions. Further, ChordATune provides a mechanism to arrange chords according to different genres, drum beats and tempi based on user preference. A machine learning approach with Hidden Markov Model (HMM), along with dynamic programming is used to generate the chord progression for a given melody and embed the <b>emotional</b> <b>factor</b> of the user. The melody is taken in as an audio file to the system, where a pitch class profile is created at run time representing the pitch content of the file over time. In order to embed the <b>emotional</b> <b>factor,</b> the Hidden Markov Model is dynamically created, and HMM properties are generated at run time according to the selected <b>emotional</b> <b>factor</b> and the input pitch classes (melody). Around 250 lead sheets were used to train the system using data driven and heuristic approaches, and the evaluation results represented 80 % user satisfaction of the prototype. This research further opens a path for research concerning chord progression generation for vocals, {{taking into account the}} extraction of words, <b>emotional</b> <b>factor</b> and the tune extracted from the actual voice of the user...|$|E

As every student is different in behaviors, dealing with different attitudes and trying to understand every student in the way they learn best, can sometimes be the hardest thing for a teacher. According to the literature, when students enter secondary school they go through some changes that affect their overall behavior. If students do not find that warm environment that triggers them into learning, they must find school boring and probably they will quit on their efforts to learn. During the transition of students into high school, the <b>emotional</b> <b>factor</b> is another problem that most of the students encounter. Due to the <b>emotional</b> <b>factor,</b> students must find really hard to accommodate in the classroom. Thus it is very demanding that teachers help their students. This can be done through some methods that every EL teacher must provide in the classroom. This thesis will focus in the techniques and methods that a contemporary EL teacher must apply in the classroom in order get the students attention. The motivation that student must get, it is an important aspect that helps {{students to}} appreciate the real value of learning. This thesis will focus on the methods and the techniques that an English language teacher must provide in a classroom in order to engage their students in the process of learning. The construction of the thesis will be based on experiments and questionnaires.
