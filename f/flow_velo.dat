40|$|A {{new time}} {{discretization}} scheme for the numerical simulation of two-phase flow {{governed by a}} thermo dynamically consistent diffuse interface model is presented. The scheme is consistent {{in the sense that}} it allows for a discrete in time energy inequality. An adaptive spatial discretization is proposed that conserves the energy inequality in the fully discrete setting by applying a suitable post processing step to the adaptive cycle. For the fully discrete scheme a quasi-reliable error estimator is derived which estimates the error both of the <b>flow</b> <b>velo</b> city, and of the phase field. The validity of the energy inequality in the fully discrete setting is numerically investigated...|$|E

40|$|The aim of our {{investigation}} was to explore a new method of analysing flow images, based on the Optical Flow Technique. Conventionally, this technique was developed for detecting motion of large objects in a real world scene. Applied to the flow images, {{it appears to be}} an interesting alternative offering high evaluation accuracy without most of the typical limitations characteristic of FFT based PIV. Besides evaluation of tracer images, the new method was also tested with smoke images obtained from experiments both in a fluidised bed and in a wind tunnel. It was also successfully tested on an image sequence of a vapor bubble growing on a thin heated wire. The accuracy of the velocity measurements using the new implementation was investigated using synthetic particle image sequences generated {{with the help of a}} 2 D numerical simulation. 1 Introduction The aim of this investigation is to explore the possibility of using an optical flow technique in measuring fluid <b>flow</b> <b>velo</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Since {{their first}} studies {{targeting}} the cooling of high-power computing chips, micro-channel devices are proven {{to provide a}} very efficient cooling system. In the last years micro-channel cooling has been successfully applied to the cooling of particle detectors at CERN. Thanks to their high thermal efficiency, they can guarantee a good heat sink for the cooling of silicon trackers, fundamental for {{the reduction of the}} radiation damage caused by the beam interactions. The radiation damage on the silicon detector is increasing with temperature and furthermore the detectors are producing heat that should be dissipated in the supporting structure. Micro-channels guarantee a distributed and uniform thermal exchange, thanks to the high flexibility of the micro-fabrication process that allows a large variety of channel designs. The thin nature of the micro-channels etched inside silicon wafers, is fulfilling the physics requirement of minimization of the material crossed by the particle beam. Furthermore micro-channels are well suited to be fabricated in silicon, as the same material of the detector they need to cool, and in this way mechanical stresses due to thermal gradients and different Coefficients of Thermal Expansion are minimized in the structure. The silicon micro-channel device fabrication starts with the etching of the channels in a silicon wafer, followed by the bonding of a cover wafer in silicon (or in Pyrex for testing purposes) to close the channels, and ends with the etching of the fluidic apertures for the fluid circulation. The fluid circulating inside can be in single phase or two phase flow and the flow parameters like pressure, temperature or mass flow, can vary following each detector requirements. After the micro-fabrication of the cooling devices, thermal and fluidic tests are done to validate the channels performances before integrating them in the detector structure. The mechanical integration inside the detector starts with the equipment of the device with fluidic connectors for the fluid circulation, is followed by the gluing of the detector on the micro-channels surface, and ends with the mechanical jigs and supports needed to integrate the cooling in the detector structure. The first High Energy Physics experiment pioneering micro-channel cooling was the NA 62 detector who chose to cool its three GTK stations with a micro-channel plate circulating C 6 F 14 in liquid <b>flow.</b> The LHCb <b>VELO</b> detector has chosen a CO 2 evaporative flow in micro-channels for its upgrade in 2018. The ATLAS and ALICE detectors are evaluating the possibility of adopting a cooling system based on two-phase cooling in micro-channels using CO 2 and C 4 F 10 fluids respectively. Starting with the first application of micro-channel cooling, this novel cooling system applied to particle detector at CERN is fully analysed in this thesis. The four micro-channels cooling applications currently developed at CERN, are analysed in different fields: the micro-fabrication of the cooling plates, the structural properties of silicon to understand the maximum pressure a device can hold, the thermal exchange and fluid circulation to evaluate the cooling performances and, in the last part, the mechanical integration of the silicon cooling plate inside the detector infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE — Tissue {{oxygen supply}} {{is crucial for}} wound healing. Especially in {{diabetic}} foot lesions, the chances for healing are mainly dependent on {{the presence or absence}} of ischemia. This study investigates the impact of the tissue O 2 analysis system “O 2 C ” for noninvasive quantification of tissue oxygenation in diabetic foot ulcer patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — O 2 C assessed relative blood flow (flow), flow velocity (velo), and hemoglobin concentration (rHb) and hemoglobin oxygenation (SO 2) at 2 and 6 mm depth (means SE). 1) Measurements were performed on intact skin of the forefoot and forearm of 20 healthy volunteers on 2 consecutive days. 2) Parameters were assessed on intact skin of the forefoot of diabetic foot ulcer patients (n 14). 3) Measurements were performed directly at the wound site in diabetic patients (n 14). RESULTS — 1) <b>Flow,</b> <b>velo,</b> rHb, and SO 2 at 2 and 6 mm depth were not significantly different when measured at 2 consecutive days. 2) There were no significant differences between diabetic subjects and healthy volunteers. Only flow in 6 mm depth was significantly higher in diabetic subjects (75 13 vs. 51 0. 4 arbitrary units [AU], P 0. 05). When diabetic foot ulcer patients were split into healers and nonhealers, initial readings of SO 2 at 2 mm (32 6 vs. 44 3 %,...|$|E
