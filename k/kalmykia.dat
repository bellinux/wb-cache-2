25|$|Vajrayana, {{a body of}} teachings {{attributed}} to Indian siddhas, {{may be viewed as}} a third branch or merely a part of Mahayana. Tibetan Buddhism, which preserves the Vajrayana teachings of eighth century India, is practiced in regions surrounding the Himalayas, Mongolia and <b>Kalmykia.</b> Tibetan Buddhism aspires to Buddhahood or rainbow body.|$|E
25|$|Buddhism is {{traditional}} in three {{regions of the}} Russian Federation: Buryatia, Tuva, and <b>Kalmykia.</b> According to various reports, the proportion of not religious people in Russia is between 16% and 48% of the population. According to recent studies, the proportion of atheists has significantly decreased over the decades after {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|The Tibetan Buddhist schools, {{based on}} the {{lineages}} and textual traditions of the Kangyur and Tengyur of Tibet, are found in Tibet, Bhutan, northern India, Nepal, southwestern and northern China, Mongolia and various constituent republics of Russia that are adjacent to the area, such as Amur Oblast, Buryatia, Chita Oblast, the Tuva Republic and Khabarovsk Krai. Tibetan Buddhism is also the main religion in <b>Kalmykia.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{comprised}} the Republic of Adygeya, the Republic of Dagestan, the Republic of Ingushetia, the Kabardino-Balkar Republic, the Republic of <b>Kalmykia,</b> the Karachay–Cherkess Republic, the Republic of North Osetia-Alaniya, the Chechen Republic, Krasnodar Krai, Stavropol Krai, and Astrakhan, Volgograd, and Rostov oblasts. It {{has the same}} borders as the Southern Federal District. Its last commander was Lieutenant General Alexander Galkin, appointed from January 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{second most}} popular {{religion}} is Islam (6%) concentrated {{mainly in the}} Balkans and eastern Europe (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Kosovo, Kazakhstan, North Cyprus, Turkey, Azerbaijan, North Caucasus, and the Volga-Ural region). Other religions, including Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism are minority religions (though Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion of Russia's Republic of <b>Kalmykia).</b> The 20th century saw the revival of Neopaganism through movements such as Wicca and Druidry.|$|E
25|$|Buddhism and Protestantism {{came into}} {{political}} conflict in 19th century Sri Lanka and in Tibet c. 1904 (the Francis Younghusband Expedition). Various events have cooperated to introduce various strains of Buddhist theology and meditation to {{several generations of}} Western spiritual seekers (including some Catholic religious). Relations are generally good between both religions, except perhaps in South Korea. The Russian republic of <b>Kalmykia</b> recognizes both Tibetan/Lamaist Buddhism and Russian Orthodoxy as its official religions.|$|E
25|$|Mongoloid or Asiatic peoples are {{the most}} spread out among all human populations since they have {{stretched}} almost completely around the earth's surface. From an Asian point of reference, populations range from as far east as Greenland, to as far west as <b>Kalmykia,</b> Crimea, and northern Europe, giving Asiatic peoples or their descendants a historical presence across four continents. According to the Meyers Konversations-Lexikon (1885–90), peoples included in the Mongoloid race are North Mongol, Chinese & Indochinese, Japanese & Korean, Tibetan & Burmese, Malay, Polynesian, Maori, Micronesian, Eskimo, and Native American.|$|E
25|$|The steppe {{has long}} been {{depicted}} as the typical Russian landscape. It is a broad band of treeless, grassy plains, interrupted by mountain ranges, extending from Hungary across Ukraine, southern Russia, and Kazakhstan before ending in Manchuria. Most of the Soviet Union's steppe zone was located in the Ukrainian and Kazakh republics; the much smaller Russian steppe is located mainly between those nations, extending southward between the Black and Caspian Seas before blending into the increasingly desiccated territory of the Republic of <b>Kalmykia.</b> In a country of extremes, the steppe zone provides the most favorable conditions for human settlement and agriculture because of its moderate temperatures and normally adequate levels of sunshine and moisture. Even here, however, agricultural yields are sometimes adversely affected by unpredictable levels of precipitation and occasional catastrophic droughts. The soil is very dry.|$|E
25|$|Religion is {{extremely}} important to the Tibetans and has a strong influence over all aspects of their lives. Bön is the indigenous religion of Tibet, but has been almost eclipsed by Tibetan Buddhism, a distinctive form of Mahayana and Vajrayana, which was introduced into Tibet from the Sanskrit Buddhist tradition of northern India. Tibetan Buddhism is practiced not only in Tibet but also in Mongolia, parts of northern India, the Buryat Republic, the Tuva Republic, and in the Republic of <b>Kalmykia</b> and some other parts of China. During China's Cultural Revolution, nearly all Tibet's monasteries were ransacked and destroyed by the Red Guards. A few monasteries have begun to rebuild since the 1980s (with limited support from the Chinese government) and greater religious freedom has been granted– although it is still limited. Monks returned to monasteries across Tibet and monastic education resumed even though the number of monks imposed is strictly limited. Before the 1950s, between 10 and 20% of males in Tibet were monks.|$|E
500|$|Brass, an alloy {{of copper}} and zinc in various proportions, {{was used as}} early as the third {{millennium}} BC in the Aegean, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, <b>Kalmykia,</b> Turkmenistan and Georgia, and the second millennium BC in West India, Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Israel (Judea). Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India, though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks. The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC. To date, the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, {{as early as the}} 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc. Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called [...] "philosopher's wool" [...] or [...] "white snow".|$|E

2500|$|In the Christian era, Buddhist ideas {{periodically}} filtered into Europe via the Middle East. Stories of the Christian saints Barlaam and Josaphat were [...] "baptized" [...] {{renditions of}} the life of Siddhartha Gautama, as translated from Indian sources into Persian to Arabic to Greek versions, the religious language being only cosmetically altered along the way. The first direct recorded encounter between European Christians and Buddhists was in 1253 when the king of France sent William of Rubruck as an ambassador to the court of the Mongol Empire. Later, in the 17th century, Mongols practicing Tibetan Buddhism established <b>Kalmykia,</b> the only Buddhist nation in Europe, at {{the eastern edge of the}} continent.|$|E
