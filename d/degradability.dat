25|$|Substrate {{composition}} {{is a major}} factor in determining the methane yield and methane production rates from the digestion of biomass. Techniques to determine the compositional characteristics of the feedstock are available, while parameters such as solids, elemental, and organic analyses are important for digester design and operation. Methane yield can be estimated from the elemental composition of substrate along with an estimate of its <b>degradability</b> (the fraction of the substrate that is converted to biogas in a reactor). In order to predict biogas composition (the relative fractions of methane and carbon dioxide) it is necessary to estimate carbon dioxide partitioning between the aqueous and gas phases, which requires additional information (reactor temperature, pH, and substrate composition) and a chemical speciation model.|$|E

These are all concentrated sources of protein and amino acids and some are also good sources of vitamins and essential minerals. There are many possible sources of plant protein for livestock rations. These include oilseeds, by-products of food production, arable and forage legumes. Animal origin protein supplements in general have better composition and balance of amino acids compared with plant origin proteins. Higher level of rumen undegradable intake protein fractions of animal sourced proteins has been demonstrated.

40|$|Four silage diets were {{prepared}} from tropical grass and legume mixtures and fed to intestinally fistulated sheep {{to determine the}} sites and extent of digestion of the different silage components in the digestive tract. Pangola grass (Digitaria decumbens) was ensiled either alone or with the addition, 33 % (w/w), of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham), gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) or cowpea (Vigna unguiculata cv. Caloona). All forages were grown at the University of Queensland farm in 1985. All silages were well preserved as indicated by low pH (290 g/kg) and lactic acid (> 41 g/kg DM) contents. The inclusion of leucaena and gliricidia significantly increased the total N content of the silages. The addition of legumes at ensiling significantly increased rumen ammonia N (pangola 59 mg N/l, legume diets 110 – 115 mg N/l) {{and the proportion of}} propionic acid in rumen fluid. Sheep given pangola + leucaena silages had significantly higher DM intakes (66. 3 g/kg Wper day) than sheep given pangola and pangola + cowpea silages (52. 4 and 53. 2 g/kg Wper day respectively). The inclusion of gliricidia significantly depressed silage intake (43 T g/kg Wper day). There were no significant effects of diet on DM (551 – 609 g/kg) and organic matter (550 – 612 g/kg) digestibility. Sheep given pangola + leucaena silages had higher N intakes, N balances, rates and efficiencies of microbial N synthesis and total non-ammonia N (NAN) flows to the small intestine than did sheep given the other silages. Apparent <b>degradabilities</b> of silage N in the rumen were similar for all diets (0. 491 – 0. 559 g N/kg N intake), but sheep given pangola + leucaena silages had lower true (corrected for endogenous N) N <b>degradabilities</b> (0. 648 g N/kg N intake) than those given the other diets (0. 751 – 0. 775 g N/kg N intake).

The present study aimed to survey the annual yield of garlic stalk in Korea and determine its feed-nutritive value for ruminants. Methods In Experiment 1, garlic stalk was incubated in situ in the rumen of two Hanwoo steers (360  ±  15  kg body weight) and removed after 12, 24, or 48  h to determine the ruminal degradation kinetics of DM and NDF. Rice straw was also included for comparison. In Experiment 2, In Experiment 2, six male Corriedale sheep were randomized to two dietary treatments to determine the apparent digestibility of nutrients in garlic stalk. Diets included a control ration without garlic stalk (60 % concentrate mix + 40 % ryegrass) or a treatment ration (70 % control diet + 30 % garlic stalk). Results The Korean national yield of garlic stalk (sun-dried basis) in 2016 {{was estimated to be}} 31, 910 tons, with the southern coastal regions producing the highest quantity. Compared with rice straw, garlic stalk had lower NDF, higher ADF, and greater effective <b>degradabilities</b> of DM and NDF, resulting in a greater TDN value (56. 3 %), which was higher than that obtained for rice straw (43. 7 %).

The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine types and amounts of tannins and also to evaluate the nutritive value of tree foliages, Acacia karroo, Acacia nilotica, Acacia tortilis, Acacia galpinii, Acacia sieberiana, Acacia hebeclada and Acacia rhemniana, grown in the Limpopo Province and also to determine types and amounts of tannins occurring in them. Young leaves with petioles from seven tree foliages were collected from five different trees per species at the University of the North (now University of Limpopo) in April 2003, in a completely randomized design. Packed volume ranged from 1. 50 mL/g for A. karroo to 3. 00 mL/g for A. hebeclada whilst water retention ranged from 3. 71 g/g for A. galpinii to 4. 98 g/g for A. sieberiana. These results suggest that all the tree leaves have a high intake potential. All the Acacia species had crude protein levels above 100 g/kg dry matter (DM), ranging from 103 g/kg DM for A. rhemniana to 183 g/kg DM for A. sieberiana. Crude protein levels of this magnitude in a diet are adequate to support the maintenance requirements of cattle, sheep and goats at low to medium production levels. The Acacias contained medium to high levels of neutral and acid detergent fibres with ranges of 488 to 622 and 415 to 545 g/kg DM, respectively. In vitro DM and organic matter <b>degradabilities</b> varied from 345 to 534 and 254 to 474 g/kg DM, respectively. Acacia hebeclada, A. sieberiana and A. galpinii contained traces of total phenolics whilst A. tortilis contained approximately 90 g/kg DM of total phenolics and A. karroo, A. nilotica and A. rhemniana contained intermediate concentrations. Extract condensed tannin (CT) content ranged from 1. 1 g/kg in A. hebeclada to 80. 7 g/kg in A. karroo. At level above 50 g/kg, CT tends to negatively affect intake and digestibility in ruminants. Consequently, reduced intakes of A. galpinii, A. karroo and A. tortilis could be expected because they contained CT values above 50 g/kg. Only A. nilotica showed a sharp curve in the potassium iodate test, reflecting its considerable content of hydrolysable tannins (HT). All the other species had flat curves reflecting low levels of HT in them. The results showed that all the species except for A. galpinii, A. karroo and A. tortilis are of good nutritive value and have a potential for integration into livestock feeding systems in the Limpopo Province...|$|R
50|$|To make soy ink, {{soybean oil}} is {{slightly}} refined and then blended with pigment, resins, and waxes. Even though soybean oil is an edible vegetable oil, soy ink is not edible or 100% biodegradable because the pigments and other additives that {{are mixed with}} the oil {{are the same as}} those used in petroleum-based inks. <b>Degradability</b> studies conducted by Erhan and Bagby concluded that the pigment carrier in 100-percent soy ink degrades almost twice as completely as ink made from soy oil and petroleum resins, and more than four times as completely as standard petroleum inks. Soy ink is a helpful component in paper recycling because the soy ink can be removed more easily than regular ink from paper during the de-inking process.|$|E
