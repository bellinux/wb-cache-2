50|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, City Hall {{was showing}} signs of age and deterioration. The slate roof leaked, the {{exterior}} marble was eroding in places and the heating, cooling and electrical systems needed to be replaced. Even the cast iron dome's fastenings had rusted through and many plates were cracked. In 1959, 15 pounds of iron ornament came loose and plunged 150 feet into the Board of Estimates hearing room. In 1974 the city voted to renovate the old city hall rather than build a new one. Architectural Heritage Inc., in association with Meyers, D'Aleo and Patton Inc., local architects, were retained to begin the design. The ceremonial chambers were restored and the office space was doubled. In the process the dome was disassembled and put back together. Two years and $10.5 million dollars later the Mayor, the City Council and other city departments moved back into the building. Usable space was increased almost twofold after the renovation, by fitting in two extra floors, by replacing <b>dead</b> <b>storage</b> space <b>in</b> the basement with offices, and by moving corridor walls to maximize office space.|$|R
50|$|The Thác Bà Hydropower Plant {{is a major}} {{hydropower}} project {{located within}} the province on the Chay River, built between 1964 and 1971 with assistance from the Soviet Union.

Despite frequent air strikes by the United States Air Force during this period, the first unit of the power plant was commissioned on October 5, 1971; the second unit followed on August 1972, and the third unit on May 19, 1972. The power plant currently has a capacity of 120 MW, and has an energy generating potential of 400 million kWh/year. The project as built has a dam 48 m high and 657 m long, creating a gross storage capacity of 2.49 cubic kilometres with a live storage of 2.16 cubic kilometres on the Chay River draining a catchment of 6430 km at the dam site. The reservoir is 60 km with a water spread of 235 km at the Full Reservoir Level of +58 m. The project has been designed for a maximum flood discharge of 3,650 m/s.

40|$|International audienceThe {{classical}} one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation (ADE) {{gives an}} inadequate description of tracer cloud {{evolution in the}} River Severn, U. K. A solute transport model incorporating the effects of tracer <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>dead</b> zones is presented in which the channel is conceived as being divided into two parallel regions. The bulk flow region occurs in the central part. Its longitudinal dispersive properties are described by the ADE. Adjacent to this, an additional cross-sectional area is defined in which tracer can be stored temporarily in regions of slowly moving water called dead zones. Exchange between the two regions follows a first order rate equation. Applying the model to the River Severn shows that a dispersing cloud's evolution occurs in two distinct stages with a rapid transitional phase. Initially, shear-dispersion is dominant while the tracer particles mix fully over the bulk flow. Once this has occurred, <b>dead</b> zone <b>storage</b> accounts well for the non-Fickian evolution of the cloud. After the transitional phase the <b>dead</b> zone <b>storage</b> mechanism clearly dominates over shear-dispersion.
