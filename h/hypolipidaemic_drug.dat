40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) {{has been}} used for decades for the determination of different classes of pharmaceuticals in different sample matrices because of its advantageous high separation efficiency and fast analysis time. However, the major disadvantage of CE is its poor detection sensitivity. In the current work, the improvement in detection sensitivity of CE has been extensively studied and applied for the determination of two classes of pharmaceutical compounds. Electrokinetic supercharging (EKS), a powerful preconcentration technique in CE, has been studied for the analysis of seven non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The separation selectivity was optimised via adjustment of the concentration of the separation buffer (disodium tetraborate pH 9. 20) and the amount of methanol as an organic modifier. Different EKS parameters, including injection voltage, injection time, and amounts of leading and terminating electrolytes were studied. The optimised conditions allowed detection sensitivity to be improved by 2, 400 -fold when compared to field-amplified sample stacking (FASS) and the limits of detection (LODs) were down to 50 ng/L. A valuable modification to the EKS system, namely counter-flow EKS (CF-EKS), has been developed in order to decrease the amount of the interfering sample matrix involved in the system, hence, larger amount of analytes could be concentrated. Computer simulation studies were undertaken {{in order to understand the}} trends in sensitivity enhancement from EKS to CF-EKS. After assigning the optimal counter pressure and injection voltage in CF-EKS, an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed for optimising the injection time and the amount of terminating electrolyte. Upon comparison with FASS, the optimal conditions of CF-EKS allowed the sensitivity to be enhanced by 11, 800 -fold and the LODs were decreased to 10. 70 ng/L for the studied NSAIDs. The on-line hyphenation of EKS-CE with the highly precise electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was for the first time investigated, and then applied for the determination of five acidic <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drugs.</b> The separation was performed in a co-electroosmotic flow (co-EOF) mode using the EOF reversal agent hexadimethrine bromide (HDMB) in ammonium bicarbonate buffer pH 9. 00. An ANN was developed for the optimisation of the separation selectivity, and the EKS-ESI-MS system provided enhancement in detection sensitivity of 1, 000 -fold when compared to FASS. The LODs for the studied <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drugs</b> were decreased to 180 ng/L. Simultaneous separation of charged and neutral <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drugs</b> was made possible by the application of micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). Ammonium bicarbonate pH 8. 50 was used as a separation electrolyte and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used as a micelle-forming agent.

40|$|The {{peroxisome}} proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is {{a member}} of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily and is activated by a variety of fibrate <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drugs</b> and non-genotoxic rodent hepatocarcinogens that are collectively termed peroxisome proliferators. A key marker of peroxisome proliferator action is the peroxisomal enzyme acyl CoA oxidase, which is elevated about ten fold in the livers of treated rodents. Additional peroxisome proliferator responsive genes include other peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes and members of the cytochrome P 450 IVA family. A peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE), consisting of an almost perfect direct repeat of the sequence TGACCT spaced by a single base pair, has been identified in the upstream regulatory sequences of each of these genes. The retinoid X receptor (RXR) forms a heterodimer with PPAR and binds to the PPRE. Furthermore, the RXR ligand, 9 -cis retinoic acid, enhances PPAR action. Retinoids may therefore modulate the action of peroxisome proliferators and PPAR may interfere with retinoid action, perhaps providing one mechanism to explain the toxicity of peroxisome proliferators. Interestingly, a variety of fatty acids can activate PPAR supporting the suggestion that fatty acids, or their acyl CoA derivatives, may be the natural ligands of PPAR and that the physiological role of PPAR is to regulate fatty acid homeostasis. Taken together, the discovery of PPAR has opened up new opportunities in understanding how lipid homeostasis is regulated, how the fibrate <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drugs</b> may act and should lead to improvements in the assessment of human risk from peroxisome proliferators based upon a better understanding of their mechanism of action...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Dyslipidaemia is {{frequently}} present in obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM). The predominant features of dyslipidaemia in these disorders include increased flux of free fatty acids (FFA), raised triglyceride (TG) and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, a predominance of small, dense (atherogenic) low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) particles and raised apolipoprotein (apo) B values Posprandial hyperlipidaemia may also be present. Insulin resistance (IR) appears {{to play an important}} role in the pathogenesis of dyslipidaemia in obesity, MetS and T 2 DM. The cornerstone of treatment of this IR-related dyslipidaemia is lifestyle changes and in diabetic patients, tight glycaemic control. In addition to these measures, recent clinical trials showed benefit with statin treatment. Nevertheless, a substantial percentage of patients treated with statins still experience vascular events.

METHODS: Cross-sectional population-based study including 2863 women and 2546 men aged 35 - 75 years (CoLaus study). Alcohol intake {{was assessed by}} the reported alcohol consumption of the last 7 days. Nineteen candidate genes known to influence HDL levels were studied. RESULTS: Alcohol consumption increased HDL cholesterol levels in both genders. After multivariate adjustment for gender, age, body mass index, smoking, <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drug</b> treatment, physical activity and alcohol consumption, APOA 5, CETP, LIPC and LPL gene polymorphisms were significantly (10 (- 5) threshold) related with HDL cholesterol levels, while no genexalcohol intake interaction was found for all SNPs studied. ABCA 1 polymorphisms were related to HDL cholesterol levels on bivariate analysis but the relationship was no longer significant after multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm the association of alcohol consumption and of APOA 5, CETP, LIPC and LPL gene polymorphisms with HDL cholesterol levels.

40|$|Liver fatty-acid-binding protein (L-FABP) is a cytoplasmic {{polypeptide}} {{that binds}} with strong affinity especially to long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). It is highly expressed {{in both the}} liver and small intestine, where it {{is thought to have}} an essential role in the control of the cellular fatty acid (FA) flux. Because expression of the gene encoding L-FABP is increased by both fibrate <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drugs</b> and LCFAs, it seems to be under the control of transcription factors, termed peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), activated by fibrate or FAs. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which these regulations take place remain to be fully substantiated. Using transfection assays, we found that the different PPAR subtypes (alpha, gamma and delta) are able to mediate the up-regulation by FAs of the gene encoding L-FABP in vitro. Through analysis of LCFA- and fibrate-mediated effects on L-FABP mRNA levels in wild-type and PPARalpha-null mice, we have found that PPARalpha in the intestine does not constitute a dominant regulator of L-FABP gene expression, in contrast with what is known in the liver. Only the PPARdelta/alpha agonist GW 2433 is able to up-regulate the gene encoding L-FABP in the intestine of PPARalpha-null mice. These findings demonstrate that PPARdelta can act as a fibrate/FA-activated receptor in tissues in which it is highly expressed and that L-FABP is a PPARdelta target gene in the small intestine. We propose that PPARdelta contributes to metabolic adaptation of the small intestine to changes in the lipid content of the diet...|$|R

As {{a first step in}} defining the mechanisms regulating liver mitochondrial contents in these models, the current studies were designed to test the hypothesis that hepatic mitochondrial proliferation is associated with enhanced translation rates of mitochondrial DNA gene products. Incorporation of [35 S]methionine and [3 H]leucine into protein was quantified in mitochondria isolated from control, clofibrate- and HCCL-treated rats. Use of multiple amino acid substrate concentrations permitted the maximal rate of translation (Vmax.) to be determined independent of endogenous amino acid concentrations.

These receptors form a subgroup of ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to the nuclear hormone receptor family. This review discusses a selection of novel PPAR functions identified {{during the last few}} years. The PPARs regulate processes that are essential for the maintenance of pregnancy and embryonic development. Newly found hepatic functions of PPARα are the mediation of female-specific gene repression and the protection of the liver from oestrogen induced toxicity. PPARα also controls lipid catabolism and is the target of <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drugs,</b> whereas PPARγ controls adipocyte differentiation and regulates lipid storage; it is the target for the insulin sensitising thiazolidinediones used to treat type 2 diabetes. Activation of PPARβ/δ increases lipid catabolism in skeletal muscle, the heart and adipose tissue. In addition, PPARβ/δ ligands prevent weight gain and suppress macrophage derived inflammation. In fact, therapeutic benefits of PPAR ligands have been confirmed in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as encephalomyelitis and inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, PPARs promote skin wound repair. PPARα favours skin healing during the inflammatory phase that follows injury, whilst PPARβ/δ enhances keratinocyte survival and migration. Due to their collective functions in skin, PPARs represent a major research target for our understanding of many skin diseases.

These increases in enzyme activities in suckling rats were similar to those seen in the livers of the drug-treated, lactating mothers after 14 days of treatment. After administering [3 H]nafenopin or [3 H]Wy- 14, 643 to lactating rats, significant levels of drug-derived radioactivity were observed in suckling rat gastric milk curds by 2 - 4 h with significant radioactivity seen in suckling rat livers by 4 - 6 h.

40|$|Abstract: The {{peroxisome}} proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription {{factors that}} regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. The role of PPARs in several chronic {{diseases such as}} type 2 diabetes, obesity and atherosclerosis is well known and, for this reason, they are the targets of antidiabetic and <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drugs.</b> In the last decade, some rare mutations in human PPAR[gamma] that might be associated with partial lipodystrophy, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and colon cancer have emerged. In particular, the F 360 L mutant of PPAR[gamma] (PPAR[gamma] 2 residue 388), which is associated with familial partial lipodystrophy, significantly decreases basal transcriptional activity and impairs stimulation by synthetic ligands. To date, the structural reason for this defective behaviour is unclear. Therefore, the crystal structure of PPAR[gamma] F 360 L together with the partial agonist LT 175 has been solved and the mutant has been characterized by circular-dichroism spectroscopy (CD) in order to compare its thermal stability {{with that of the}} wild-type receptor. The X-ray analysis showed that the mutation induces dramatic conformational changes in the C-terminal part of the receptor ligand-binding domain (LBD) owing to the loss of van der Waals interactions made by the Phe 360 residue in the wild type and an important salt bridge made by Arg 357, with consequent rearrangement of loop 11 / 12 and the activation function helix 12 (H 12). The increased mobility of H 12 makes the binding of co-activators in the hydrophobic cleft less efficient, thereby markedly lowering the transactivation activity. The spectroscopic analysis in solution and molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations provided results which were in agreement and consistent with the mutant conformational changes observed by X-ray analysis. Moreover, to evaluate the importance of the salt bridge made by Arg 357, the crystal structure of the PPAR[gamma] R 357 A mutant in complex with the agonist rosiglitazone has been solved...|$|R

Peroxisome proliferation is accompanied by liver enlargement and elevated transcrip-tion of genes encoding the microsomal enzyme p 450 IVA 1 and the peroxisomal enzymes of-oxidation, which include acyl-CoA oxidase and peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme (Lazarow and De Duve, 1976; Orton and Parker, 1982).

It is well documented that chronic administration of per-oxisome proliferators to rodents results in the formation of liver tumours (Reddy et al., 1980; Warren et al., 1980). Wh reas the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis have not be n established, a number of theories have been proposed (reviewed by Green, 1991; Moody et al., 1991).

The cell-free translation products were immunoprecipitated with monospecific X rabbit anti-thiolase serum and analysed by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Thiolase mRNA was found predominantly in free polyribosomes, in both normal and clofibrate-treated rats. Clofibrate treatment increased mRNA activity for thiolase approx. 20 -fold.

Adult male Wistar rats received a single i. p. injection of [14 C]NDMA (2 mg/kg) and were killed 4 h later. DNA was isolated from liver and kidney, hydrolysed in 0. 1 N HCI and analysed by Sephasorb chromatography. In rats pre-treated with NAF (0. 2 % in the diet over a period of 3 weeks), the concentration of N 7 -methylguanine in hepatic DNA (μmol/mol guanine) was 46 % below control values. This is probably due to the greater amount of target DNA, as NAF caused a marked hepatomegaly with a 50 % increase in total liver DNA content. Concentrations of N 7 -methylguanine in kidney DNA were twice as high in NAF-pre-treated animals when compared to control rats. This is unlikely to result from a shift in the metabolism of NDMA from liver to other rat tissues since the time course and extent of the conversion of [14 C]NDMA to 14 CO 2 and 14 C-labelled urinary metabolites were identical in NAF-treated and control animals.

40|$|Peroxisome proliferator {{activated}} receptors (PPARs) are {{a family}} of related receptors implicated in a diverse array of biological processes. There are 3 main isotypes of PPARs known as PPARα, PPARβ and PPARγ and each is organized into domains associated with a function such as ligand binding, activation and DNA binding. PPARs are activated by ligands, which can be both endogenous such as fatty acids or their derivatives, or synthetic, such as peroxisome proliferators, <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drugs,</b> anti-inflammatory or insulin-sensitizing drugs. Once activated, PPARs bind to DNA and regulate gene transcription. The different isotypes differ in their expression patterns, lending clues on their function. PPARα is expressed mainly in liver whereas PPARγ is expressed in fat and in some macrophages. Activation of PPARα in rodent liver is associated with peroxisome proliferation and with suppression of apoptosis and induction of cell proliferation. The mechanism by which activation of PPARα regulates apoptosis and proliferation is unclear but is likely to involve target gene transcription. Similarly, PPARγ {{is involved in the}} induction of cell growth arrest occurring during the differentiation process of fibroblasts to adipocytes. However, it has been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle and cell proliferation in colon cancer models. Less in known concerning PPARβ but it was identified as a downstream target gene for APC/β-catenin/T cell factor- 4 tumor suppressor pathway, which is involved in the regulation of growth promoting genes such as c-myc and cyclin D 1. Marked species and tissue differences in the expression of PPARs complicate the extrapolation of pre-clinical data to humans. For example, PPARα ligands such as the hypolipidaemic fibrates have been used extensively in the clinic over the past 20 years to treat cardiovascular disease and side effects of clinical fibrate use are rare, despite the observation that these compounds are rodent carcinogens. Similarly, adverse clinical responses have been seen with PPARγ ligands that were not predicted by pre-clinical models.

The polypeptide PPA- 80 was purified to over 90 % purity from livers of rats treated with the peroxisome proliferators Wy- 14, 643, nafenopin, tibric acid and clofibrate by a single-step preparative sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel-electrophoretic procedure.

The anti-(polypeptide PPA- 80) antibodies did not cross-react with catalase, a marker enzyme for peroxisomes, or with NADPH–cytochrome P- 450 reductase, which has the same approximate mol. wt., 80000. The intensity of immunoprecipitin bands formed with microsomal, large-particle and postnuclear fractions from livers of animals pretreated with peroxisome proliferators was significantly greater compared with equal amounts of protein from corresponding fractions obtained from control animals, suggesting that these agents all enhance the synthesis of the same 80000 -mol. wt. polypeptide. Although the polypeptide PPA- 80 was increased in the postnuclear, large-particle and microsomal fractions of livers of rats pretreated with peroxisome proliferators, the relative abundance of this peptide in the peroxisome-rich light-mitochondrial fraction and its lack in highly purified mitochondrial fractions suggest the localization of this polypeptide in peroxisomes and/or microsomal fraction. Additional studies are needed to establish unequivocally the subcellular localization of the polypeptide PPA- 80 and to ascertain if this polypeptide is identical with the multi-functional protein displaying enoyl-CoA hydratase and β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities that was purified by Osumi & Hashimoto [(1979) Biochem.

APOE* 3 -Leiden mice were fed a saturated fat and cholesterol-rich diet supplemented with either 0. 05 or 0. 1 % w/w of lovastatin, 0. 1 or 0. 2 % w/w of gemfibrozil or 0. 1 or 0. 2 % w/w of SB 204990. Lovastatin showed a dose-related decrease in plasma cholesterol levels (up to - 20 %) due to a lowering of LDL and HDL (low density resp. high density lipoprotein) -cholesterol (- 20 and - 18 %, respectively), while plasma triglyceride levels were unaffected. Gemfibrozil had no effect on plasma total cholesterol levels but gave significant dose-dependent decreases in plasma (VLDL) triglyceride levels (tip to - 53 %). SB 204990 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of plasma cholesterol (up to - 29 %) by lowering VLDL, LDL and HDL-cholesterol (- 50, - 20 and - 20 %, respectively). In addition, a strong dose dependent reduction of plasma (VLDL) triglycerides up to - 43 % was observed with this compound. Although the effects of gemfibrozil and SB 204990 were not simply explained by changes in a single determinant of VLDL metabolism - no effects of these drugs were seen on post-heparin plasma lipoprotein lipase activity, in vivo rate of VLDL synthesis or hepatic apoC- III mRNA levels - APOE* 3 -Leiden mice were found to give robust hypolipidaemic responses to these test compounds.

We describe here the functional expression of this novel P- 450 in two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains overproducing their own NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 reductase or a reductase from Arabidopsis thaliana. The results show a much higher efficiency of the yeast strain overproducing the plant reductase compared with the yeast strain overproducing its own reductase for expressing CYP 94 A 1. The methyl end of saturated (from C- 10 to C- 16) and unsaturated (C 18 : 1, C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 3) fatty acids was mainly oxidized by CYP 94 A 1. Both E/Z and Z/E configurations of 9, 12 -octadecadienoic acids were omega-hydroxylated. Lauric, myristic and linolenic acids were oxidized with the highest turnover rate (24 min- 1). The strong regioselectivity of CYP 94 A 1 was clearly shifted with sulphur-containing substrates, since both 9 - and 11 -thia laurate analogues were sulphoxidized. Similar to animal omega-hydroxylases, this plant enzyme was strongly induced by clofibrate treatment.

40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} the present {{investigation}} relate the effects of the nutritional state and administration of clofibric acid (CLA), a <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drug</b> and peroxisomal proliferator, on phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis in rat liver and fatty acid metabolism. Fasting and CLA treatment of animals causes an increase in the amount of PE in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and mitochondria, {{as well as in the}} PE/phosphatidylcholine (PC) ratio. Moreover, the activity of the ethanolamine-specific phospholipid base exchange (PLBE) enzyme in liver ER membranes of fasted animals was enhanced by 75 % in comparison to that of animals fed ad libitum. The effect of CLA treatment was additive to that of starvation; PE synthesis tested in vitro via the Ca 2 +-sensitive PLBE reaction increased 3 -fold in comparison to rats fed ad libitum. This is confirmed by an increased Vmax for the reaction, but the affinity of the enzyme for ethanolamine was not significantly changed. These effects were accompanied by an enhanced expression of cytochrome P 450 CYP 4 A 1 isoform and elevated activity of the enzyme upon CLA administration. The stimulatory effect of CLA administration on the efficiency of the ethanolamine-specific PLBE reaction can be explained by elimination of lauric acid, a known inhibitor of de novo PE synthesis, during the course of ω-hydroxylation catalysed by CYP 4 A 1, and by increased expression of the PLBE enzyme. The products of ω-hydroxylation of lauric acid, which are then converted by dehydrogenase to 1, 12 -dodecanedioic acid, did not significantly affect the in vitro synthesis of PE...|$|E

We have induced the formation of rat liver microsomal cytochrome P- 450 by the administration of the <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drug</b> clofibrate, isolated the endoplasmic reticulum, solubilized the cytochrome P- 450 from these membranes and subdivided the cytochrome P- 450 into four fractions by the use of hydrophobic, anionic, cationic and adsorption chromatography. One of these fractions (cytochrome P- 450 fraction 1) was highly purified to a specific content of 17 nmol of cytochrome P- 450 /mg of protein and the protein was active in a reconstituted enzyme system towards the 12 - and 11 -hydroxylation of the fatty acid, dodecanoic (lauric) acid, with preferential activity towards the 12 -hydroxy metabolite. This reconstituted activity was absolutely dependent on NADPH, NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 reductase and cytochrome P- 450, indicating the role of the mixed-function oxidase system in the metabolism of lauric acid. Another fraction of the haemoprotein (cytochrome P- 450 fraction 2) preferentially formed 11 -hydroxylauric acid, whereas a third fraction (cytochrome P- 450 fraction 3) exhibited only trace laurate oxidase activity and was similar to the phenobarbitone form of the haemoprotein in that these last two cytochromes rapidly turned-over the drug benzphetamine.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase ('statins') {{are widely}} {{prescribed}} <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drugs,</b> {{which have been}} evaluated in several clinical trials involving {{hundreds of thousands of}} patients. From a safety perspective, both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance have demonstrated that statins are generally well tolerated, with rare serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that affect mainly muscle, liver and kidney. However, recent interest has been focused on a potential risk of psychiatric ADRs associated with statins, including memory loss, depression, suicidality, aggression and antisocial behaviour. Special attention is currently being paid to the potential for statin-induced sleep disorders. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the hypothesis that statins may be associated with psychiatric adverse events using quantitative and qualitative signal analysis. METHODS: The Interregional Group of Pharmacovigilance database holds reports of suspected ADRs submitted since 1988 from eight Italian regions. In the present analysis, only reports ranked at least 'possible', according to WHO causality assessment criteria, were considered. Association between statins and psychiatric events was assessed by the case/non-case methodology, calculating the ADR reporting odds ratio (ROR) as a measure of disproportionality. Cases were defined as patients with at least one reported ADR combined with the system organ class (SOC) 'psychiatric disorders'. The non-cases comprised all patients who did not experience an ADR related to the SOC 'psychiatric disorders'. Index reports comprised all ADR reports involving at least one statin, while all ADR reports not involving statins as suspected drugs were used as controls. RESULTS: According to selection criteria, 35, 314 reports were included in the analysis. A total of 71 psychiatric preferred terms combined with statins were identified in 60 reports. Among them, 14 reports (23. 3 %) noted a positive rechallenge. Both the unadjusted (0. 8; 95 % CI 0. 6, 1. 1) and adjusted ROR (0. 7; 95 % CI 0. 6, 1. 0) suggested a lower rate of reports of psychiatric events for statins as a whole class compared with all other drugs, although the difference was not significant. The five most frequently reported psychiatric events combined with statins were insomnia, somnolence, agitation, confusion and hallucination. Only insomnia was reported with higher frequency for statins compared with all other drugs (ROR = 3. 3; 95 % CI 1. 9, 5. 7), while confusion was reported with a lower frequency (ROR = 0. 4; 95 % CI 0. 1, 0. 9). Amongst statins available in Italy, only simvastatin (ROR = 0. 5; 95 % CI 0. 2, 0. 9) showed a significantly lower rate of reports of psychiatric events compared with all other drugs together. CONCLUSION: A relatively small number of possible statin-associated psychiatric ADRs have been found in our database. No significant risks for a higher overall reporting of psychiatric ADRs associated with statins were identified in comparison with all other drugs combined. However, statin-associated insomnia resulted in a significant ROR that requires further investigation...|$|R

The present investigation was undertaken to evaluate the effect of alcoholic extract of leaves of Bougainvillea spectabilis (AEBSL) on serum lipid profile in albino rats fed with high fat diet (HFD) and to compare it with a standard <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drug</b> simvastatin. Thirty healthy albino rats of both sexes (100 - 200 g) were randomized into 5 groups of 6 animals each. The groups were treated as follows: Group A: normal diet (ND); Group B: HFD (vanaspati ghee + coconut oil mixture in ratio of 3 : 2 at 10 ml/kg/day); Group C: HFD+ AEBSL (100 mg/kg/day); Group D: HFD + AEBSL (200 mg/kg/day); Group E: HFD + simvastatin (1. 8 mg/kg/day). Lipid profile was estimated after 8 weeks of treatment.

We have therefore investigated the biosynthesis of PE and ethanolamine plasmalogen via the CDP-ethanolamine and decarboxylation pathways in vivo in three rat tissues (heart, kidney and liver), which differ in ethanolamine plasmalogen content. In all three tissues [14 C]ethanolamine was incorporated into both PE and ethanolamine plasmalogen, whereas [3 H]serine was incorporated into only PS and PE fractions. When [14 C]ethanolamine was introduced into the animals, the specific radioactivity of ethanolamine plasmalogen in the kidney was always {{greater than that of}} the PE fraction; in the heart the specific radioactivity of the ethanolamine plasmalogen fraction was {{similar to that of the}} PE fraction, whereas in the liver the specific radioactivity of the PE fraction was always greater than that of the ethanolamine plasmalogen fraction.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional population-based study of 3238 women and 2846 men aged 35 - 75. METHODS: Dyslipidaemia prevalence, treatment and control were defined according to PROCAM guidelines adapted to Switzerland. RESULTS: About 29 % of the overall sample presented with dyslipidaemia, of which 39 % were treated and 58 % of those treated were controlled. Among the 710 patients with personal history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or diabetes, 632 (89 %) presented with dyslipidaemia, of which 278 (44 %) and 134 (21 %) patients were treated and adequately controlled, respectively. On multivariate analysis, <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drug</b> treatment was positively related with age and body mass index (P for trend < 0. 001), and negatively related with smoking status (P for trend < 0. 002), whereas personal history of CVD and/or diabetes had no effect [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 12, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 90 - 1. 38]. Adequate control of lipid levels was negatively related with female sex (OR= 0. 65, 95 % CI: 0. 45 - 0. 94) and personal history of CVD and/or diabetes (OR= 0. 42, 95 % CI: 0. 30 - 0. 59).

To further define this therapeutical action, a dried hydroalcoholic extract of the leaf was administered orally to streptozotocin-diabetic rats for 4 days. Plasma glucose levels were consistently found to drop by about 26 % at two different stages of diabetes. Unexpectedly, plasma triglyceride (TG) were also decreased by 39 % following treatment. Subsequent to the latter observation, possible lipid-lowering properties of the extract were investigated on other models of hyperlipidaemia and ciprofibrate, a well-established <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drug,</b> {{was used as a}} reference compound. Both drug reduced TG levels of rats on hyperlipidaemic diet in a dose-dependent fashion. When administered at single doses over the same experimental period, blueberry and ciprofibrate were effective in lowering TG concentrations in ethanol-treated normolipidaemic animals and in genetically hyperlipidaemic Yoshida rats. Unlike ciprofibrate, however, blueberry failed to prevent the rise in plasma TG elicited by fructose and did not affect free fatty acid levels in any of the above experimental conditions. In rats treated with Triton WR- 1339, blueberry feeding induced an hypolipidaemic activity one hour after injection but proved to be ineffective at later time points, thus suggesting that its hypolipidaemic action may reflect improved TG-rich lipoprotein catabolism. In addition, ciprofibrate and the extract were tested for antithrombotic activity using a collagen-triggered model of venous thrombosis in diabetic and Yoshida rats. Only ciprofibrate, however, significantly reduced thrombus formation in diabetics, possibly because of its effects on free fatty acid metabolism, whereas no effect was observed in Yoshida rats.

Enhanced activity of the peroxisomal palmitoyl-CoA oxidation system was {{also found in the}} renal-cortical homogenates of hypolipidaemic-drug-treated mice. The activity of enoyl-CoA hydratase in the mouse liver increased 30 – 50 -fold and in the kidney cortex 3 – 5 -fold with hypolipidaemic-drug-induced peroxisome proliferation in these tissues, and over 95 % of this induced activity was found to be heat-labile peroxisomal enzyme in both organs. Sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel-electrophoretic analysis of large-particle and microsomal fractions obtained from the liver and kidney cortex of mice treated with hypolipidaemic peroxisome proliferators demonstrated a substantial increase in the quantity of an 80000 -mol. wt. peroxisome-proliferation-associated polypeptide (polypeptide PPA- 80). The heat-labile peroxisomal enoyl-CoA hydratase was purified from the livers of mice treated with the <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drug</b> methyl clofenapate; the antibodies raised against this electrophoretically homogeneous protein yielded a single immunoprecipitin band with purified mouse liver enoyl-CoA hydratase and with liver and kidney cortical extracts of normal and hypolipidaemic-drug-treated mice. These anti-(mouse liver enoyl-CoA hydratase) antibodies also cross-reacted with purified rat liver enoyl-CoA hydratase and with the polypeptide PPA- 80 obtained from rat and mouse liver. Immunofluorescence studies with anti-(polypeptide PPA- 80) and anti-(peroxisomal enoyl-CoA hydratase) provided visual evidence for the localization and induction of polypeptide PPA- 80 and peroxisomal enoyl-CoA hydratase in the liver and kidney respectively of normal and hypolipidaemic-drug-treated mice. In the kidney, the distribution of these two proteins is identical and limited exclusively to the cytoplasm of proximal-convoluted-tubular epithelium.

Objective: To quantify the economic cost generated in 1 year in primary care by inadequate (or unnecessary) prescriptions for hypolipidaemic drugs. Methods: A cross-sectional study based on <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drug</b> prescriptions for a population of pensioners ordered during 1 year by 49 family physicians from 4 health areas in Madrid, Spain. Each doctor completed a data collection sheet for each patient for whom a hypolipidaemic agent was prescribed. The adequacy of each prescription was evaluated according to 2 quality levels: for level 1, it was necessary to have knowledge of the following parameters: total cholesterol level at the start of treatment, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, whether dietary intervention preceded pharmacological treatment, patient age and risk factors; for level 2, it was not necessary to have knowledge of either diet before pharmacological treatment or LDL-C levels. Inadequate expenditure was quantified by physician, by type of doctor who initiated the pharmacological treatment (the family physician, specialist, other doctor), therapeutic group and agent. Study perspective: Primary healthcare management of 4 public health areas. Results: The cost of inadequate prescriptions for hypolipidaemic drugs reached 116 480. 60 US dollars ($US; 1997 values) for quality level 1 and $US 37 893. 37 for level 2. 12. 3 % of the health professionals ordered all their prescriptions inadequately (level 1). Of the total inadequate prescription expenditure, 20. 4 % represented treatments initiated by family physicians and 35. 3 % by specialists (level 1). Statins made up 78. 2 % of the total cost; the inadequate expenditure for this therapeutic group reached $US 88 797 (level 1). Of the prescriptions for fibrates, 88 % were inadequate (level 1). Conclusions: In this study, 67 % of prescriptions for hypolipidaemic medicines were ordered inadequately in the pensioner population, which represents a considerable pharmacological expenditure. This percentage and the mean cost per inadequate prescription was higher if a specialist was the professional initiating the treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to run pharmaceutical prescription quality programmes with both primary care physicians and specialists involved.

It {{has been shown to}} exhibit hypolipidaemic effects in hamsters and humans. Previous studies have also shown that the methanol extract of T. indica fruit pulp regulated genes related to lipid metabolism. However, the lipid-lowering mechanism of the fruit has not been fully understood. The objective of this present study is to determine the lipid-lowering mechanism of T. indica fruit pulp using proteomic and transcriptomic approaches. Proteomic analyses were first performed to formulate a hypothesis on the hypolipidaemic action of the fruit. When secreted proteins extracted from control and T. indica fruit-treated HepG 2 cells were subjected to 2 -dimensional gel electrophoresis, the expression of seven proteins was found to be significantly different (p < 0. 03125). As for the HepG 2 cell lysate proteins, 20 spots were found to be significantly altered (p < 0. 05). Fourteen spots were identified and categorised based on their biological functions, namely the oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism, protein biosynthesis, cell proliferation and differentiation and mRNA splicing. When the altered secreted proteins and cell lysate proteins were co-analysed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software, lipid metabolism was found to be the top network being regulated, with a score of 31. Further data mining of the proteomic data as well as previously obtained microarray data indicated that the fruit pulp extract modulates its lipid-lowering effect through the activation of PPARα. To further demonstrate the hypolipidaemic effect of the fruit, lipid studies were conducted. DNA microarray analyses were also conducted to elucidate its mechanism of action, and fenofibrate, a <b>hypolipidaemic</b> <b>drug</b> which is a ligand to PPARα, was used as a comparison to T. indica fruit which was hypothesised to lower lipids in a similar mode of action.
