5|$|In 1910, {{after his}} {{accession}} to the throne, George V ordered {{the revival of}} the <b>Installation</b> ceremony, perhaps prompted by the first <b>Installation</b> ceremony of the more junior Order of St Michael and St George, held a few years earlier, and the building of a new chapel for the Order of the Thistle in 1911. The <b>Installation</b> ceremony took place on 22 July 1913 in the Henry VII Chapel, and Installations have been held at regular intervals since.|$|E

5|$|<b>Installation</b> 03, also {{referred}} to as Gamma Halo, appears in Halo 4. It is monitored by 049 Abject Testament and is located in the Khaphrae system, orbiting a damaged planet. Whilst no gameplay takes place on the <b>installation,</b> an extremely dense asteroid field surrounding the <b>installation</b> is the site of the UNSC scientific research base Ivanoff. It is here that UNSC scientists are conducting experiments on the Forerunner artifact called the Composer, which has the ability to convert biological forms, specifically humans, into AIs. After the game's antagonist, the Didact, activates the device, the UNSC base is left uninhabited. In Halo: Escalation, a series of comics which follows many events after Halo 4, establishes that 049 Abject Testament has long disappeared from the ring, leading a monitor to arrive at the <b>Installation,</b> just to be ambushed by a still living Didact, using the <b>Installation</b> to use the Composer.|$|E
40|$|U. S. solar <b>installations</b> by {{technology}} are detailed for 1998 ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 2005. The growth and state distribution of <b>installations</b> are different {{for the three}} primary solar sectors: ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ photovoltaics, ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ solar water heating and space heating, and ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ solar pool heating. Photovoltaic <b>installations</b> have grown steadily. Since 2001, grid-connected <b>installations</b> grew at an average rate of 52 %. California has 79 % of the <b>installations,</b> with Arizona, New Jersey, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Oregon accounting {{for most of the}} remaining <b>installations.</b> The offgrid growth has been steady, but significantly lower. Solar water heating and solar space heating <b>installations</b> have shown little growth since 1997. Hawaii dominates, with 41 % of the market. Other states with a large number of <b>installations</b> include Puerto Rico, California, Florida, and Arizona. Solar pool heating accounts for the largest number of <b>installations</b> and has grown at an average rate of 13 % since 1997. <b>Installations</b> in California and Florida are 75 % of the pool heating market...|$|R
