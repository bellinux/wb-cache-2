This study investigates hydrolysis method of breadfruit starch into dextrin with Sulphate Acid (H 2 SO 4) catalysator. Dextrin hydrolysis is carry out {{in order to produce}} high dextrin percentage by subtracting the total glucose with free glucose. This study evaluates composition change because of breadfruit starch in various time and temperature. Optimum dextrin percentage is obtained at hydrolysis temperature of 100 ÂºC, hydrolysis time 10 minutes, and 0. 5 N H 2 SO 4 concentration, with dextrin percentage of 77. 12 %. Furthermore, dextrin obtained is added by casein, cold water, triethanolamine, and water in order to form adhesive. The reserch result showed that the shear strength of the <b>dextrin</b> <b>glue</b> is 14 kg/cm 2 which is larger than that of glue of Fox brands sold in the market that is only 12. 48 kg/cm 2. Because there is previous study regarding starch hydrolysis from breadfruit by using chloride acid catalysator, then data in this research show the influence of the sulphate acid usage as catalysator of adhesive. Based on the comparison, it seems that for breadfruit starch hydrolyzed at 100 oC for 10 minutes, dextrin produced is less than that obtained by using chloride acid catalysator. The less dextrin percentage from breadfruit starch is caused by not all hydro sulphate ions are dissociated while mixing with starch. The mass balance is necessary to be completed including analysis of the breadfruit starch composition after hydrolysis to determine whether the starch has been degraded or not.

40|$|Cassava (Manihot spp.) tubers form a major {{food source}} of {{carbohydrates}} and other food nutrients for tropical dwellers. The tubers also are sources of industrial {{products such as}} <b>dextrins,</b> <b>glues,</b> ethyl alcohol, acetone and glucose etc. Post -harvest losses on storage of cassava root tubers are large because of their poor storage qualities. In this study, wholesome cassava tubers were washed and disinfected for used to study the storage and spoilage of cassava tubers using moist saw dust in sealed boxes and some exposed as control. Profuse microbial growths occurred {{on the surface of}} tubers exposed on the 4 th day and were completely soften due to fermentation of the tissues on the 7 th day. Bacteria isolated from the tubers were species of Staphylococcus, Bacillus and Diplococcus. Fungal species isolated using cultural characteristics were Candida and Aspergillus. Tubers on moist sawdust had no microbial growth but developed secondary roots on the 3 rd day of storage. They could be stored up to 3 weeks. The sawdust acted as soil for the tubers while the different gases and heat evolved by the tubers in the sealed boxes had a curing effect on the tubers. The study hence recommends that storage of cassava tubers in moist saw-dust would provide effective preservative method against post-harvest losses...|$|R
