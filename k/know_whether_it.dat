5|$|The {{existence}} of Soma Bringer was first hinted at when Nintendo filed a trademark {{for the title}} alongside others. It was officially announced in October that year at a Nintendo press conference. Published by Nintendo, Soma Bringer was the first Monolith Soft title to be released after its acquisition by Nintendo in April 2007. It was released on February 22, 2008. After positive impressions from previews during public gaming events in Japan, both IGN and 1UP.com voiced a hope that the game would receive a localization. Speaking in 2010, Saga said {{that she did not}} <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> would be released outside Japan, or whether further games set in the Soma Bringer universe would be developed.|$|E

Another reaction came from Marc Maiffret, chief technical officer and cofounder of eEye Digital Security, [...] "Our customers are paying us for a service, to protect them from all forms of malicious code.

500|$|Congress had {{appointed}} General Lee {{to command}} the Continental Army troops in the southern colonies, and his movements by land shadowed those of Clinton's fleet as it sailed south. Lee wrote from Wilmington on June 1 that the fleet had sailed, but {{that he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was sailing for Virginia or South Carolina. He headed for Charleston, saying [...] " [...] confess I know not whether I shall go to or from the enemy." [...] He arrived in Charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the harbor, and took command of the city's defenses. He immediately ran into a problem: the South Carolina troops (militia or the colonial regiments) were not on the Continental line, and thus not formally under his authority. Some South Carolina troops resisted his instructions, and Rutledge had to intervene by proclaiming Lee in command of all South Carolina forces.|$|E

500|$|In June 1862, Darwin welcomed {{favourable}} {{reviews in}} the press and wrote to Hooker; [...] "Well my orchis-book is a success (but I do not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> sells) after cursing my folly in writing it". He told his publisher, [...] "The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies", and to Asa Gray he said, [...] "I am fairly astonished at the success of my book with botanists." [...] Darwin's geologist friend Charles Lyell gave it enthusiastic praise: [...] "next to the Origin, as the most valuable of all Darwin's works." [...] However, the book attracted little attention from the general public, and in September Darwin told his cousin Fox, [...] "Hardly any one not a botanist, except yourself, as far as I know, has cared for it." [...] The book baffled a general public more interested in controversy over gorillas and cavemen. There were some reviews in gardening magazines, but few natural philosophers or zoologists noticed the book, and hardly any learned appraisals appeared.|$|E
500|$|The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston in Berkshire was {{directed}} by William Penney, with William Cook as his deputy. The scientists at Aldermaston {{did not know how}} to build a hydrogen bomb, but produced three designs: Orange Herald, a large boosted fission weapon in which the fission yield was increased ("boosted") though the addition of lithium-6 deuteride; Green Bamboo, an interim thermonuclear design in which fusion occurred in layers of lithium-6 deuteride that alternated with layers of [...] uranium-235; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design in which the thermonuclear fuel was separate and the majority of the yield came from thermonuclear burning. The British bomb designers used the terms [...] "Tom" [...] and [...] "Dick" [...] for the bomb's primary and secondary stages respectively. The Tom would be a fission bomb. It would produce radiation to implode the Dick. Implicit in the creation of a hydrogen bomb was that it would be tested. Eden, who replaced Churchill as prime minister after the latter's retirement on 5 April 1955, gave a radio broadcast in which he declared: [...] "You cannot prove a bomb until it has exploded. Nobody can <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> is effective or not until it has been tested." ...|$|E
500|$|Opinions on {{the film}} were mixed in Gulu, one of former centers of rebel {{activities}} in northern Uganda, during a showing of the film, with several of the leaders expressing support and criticism. One of the attendees, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Henry Oryem Okello, said that the criticisms directed at the film and Invisible Children were [...] "unfounded", going on to state, [...] "Invisible Children has done visible things in Acholi, for example offering scholarships to thousands of children and anyone against them is our enemy." [...] Betty Bigombe, a Ugandan cabinet minister and former peace negotiator, said, [...] "I do not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> makes any difference as far as taking [...] out is concerned. However, {{what is important is}} bringing this to the attention of policymakers. I hope that something innovative will come out of it." [...] Norbert Mao, Ugandan politician and president of the opposition Democratic Party, stated his support for the film, explaining that while it does have some problems, such as implying Ugandans did not try to fight back against the LRA and not explaining how many of the issues in the film were also exacerbated by the Ugandan government itself, the film is still a [...] "positive development" [...] for the issue, adding that while Invisible Children may not be [...] "the foremost analysts of the complicated political, historical and security dynamics" [...] in the situation, [...] "they have the most beautiful trait on earth -- compassion." ...|$|E

Globally as well as locally. There is something impressive about people for whom religion imbues their existence, from dusk to dawn, from cradle to grave. There are also Christians who feel this way. There is something endearing about people who give themselves up completely to their faith. But there is likewise something frightening about such a totality, which also is a feature of Islam. A counterbalance has to be found, and one has to, at times, {{run the risk of}} having unflattering labels placed on you. For there are some things for which one should display no tolerance. And when we are tolerant, we must <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> is because of convenience or conviction." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Stooges made {{occasional}} guest {{appearances in}} feature films, though generally they were restricted to their short subjects. Most of the Stooges' peers had either {{made the transition}} from shorts to features films (Laurel and Hardy, The Ritz Brothers) or had been starring their own feature films from the onset (Marx Brothers, Abbott and Costello). However, Moe believed that the team's firebrand style of humor worked better in short form. In 1935, Columbia proposed to star them in their own full-length feature, but Moe rejected the idea saying, [...] "It's a hard job inventing, rewriting, or stealing gags for our two-reel comedies for Columbia Pictures without having to make a seven-reeler (feature film). We can make short films out of material needed for a starring feature and then we wouldn't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> would be funny enough to click." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{his best}} friends was fellow actor Henry Fonda, {{despite the fact that the}} two had very {{different}} political ideologies. A political argument in 1947 resulted in a fistfight, but they maintained their friendship by never discussing politics again. This tale may be apocryphal as Jhan Robbins quotes Stewart as saying: [...] "Our views never interfered with our feelings for each other, we just didn't talk about certain things. I can't remember ever having an argument with him—ever!" [...] However, Jane Fonda told Donald Dewey for his 1996 biography of Stewart that her father did have a falling out with Stewart at that time, although she did not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was because of their political differences. There is a brief reference to their political differences in character in their movie The Cheyenne Social Club.

2500|$|In December, the U.S. NIE (representing the {{consensus}} view of all 16 American spy agencies) [...] "judged with high confidence" [...] that Iran had halted {{its nuclear weapons}} program in 2003, with [...] "moderate confidence" [...] that the program remains frozen, and with [...] "moderate-to-high confidence" [...] that Iran is [...] "keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons". The estimate said that the enrichment program could still provide Iran with enough raw material to produce a nuclear weapon sometime by the middle of next decade but that intelligence agencies [...] "do not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> currently intends to develop nuclear weapons" [...] at some future date. Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader of the Senate in 2008, said he hoped the administration would [...] "appropriately adjust its rhetoric and policy". The conclusion that Iran had a nuclear weapons program in 2003 was reportedly mainly based on the contents of a laptop computer that was allegedly stolen from Iran and provided to US intelligence agencies by dissidents. The Russians dismissed this conclusion, stating that they had not seen evidence that Iran had ever pursued a nuclear weapons program.|$|E

[...] William & Mary alumnus and third American president, Thomas Jefferson, was perhaps the most famous member of the F.H.C. Society. Other notable members of the original society included Col. James Innes, St. George Tucker, and George Wythe. Jefferson noted that, [...] "When I was a student of Wm. & Mary college of this state, there existed a society called the F.H.C. society, confined to the number of six students only, of which I was a member, but it had no useful object, nor do I <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> now exists." [...] The best opinion is that the society did not survive the British invasion of Virginia {{at the end of the}} American Revolution.
