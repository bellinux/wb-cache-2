It also has a white stripe separating the roof from the base, and a light blue <b>lower</b> dash <b>panel.</b> The Fastway livery is a silver base with navy blue cantrail panels and a navy blue <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> <b>panel.</b> Some older buses feature light blue with a dark blue roof and skirt panels along with a dark blue <b>lower</b> dash <b>panel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An {{arpeggiator}}, with {{a choice}} of up, down, up/down, or random mode. The arpeggiator can be prominently heard in Duran Duran's 1982 hit single [...] "Rio." [...] Switches on the far left select between the internal rate, adjustable, or an external source, such as the clock out of its contemporary, the Roland CR-78—a programmable analog drum machine. A hold button on the <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> allows users to latch or set a constantly running arpeggiator pattern, useful when playing leads on another machine over a JP-4 pattern. Otherwise the arpeggiation only responds when keys, individual or chords, are pressed. This allows for a more fluid and less rigid timing in live situations when playing with others.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of the HST, the power-to-weight ratio of [...] to 374 LT meant that there was no {{difficulty}} in keeping to time. However, operating instructions dictated that an HST running with only one operational power car should be piloted over the South Devon Banks. As the drawbar on the HSTs was behind the <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> <b>panel,</b> the procedure required to attach an additional locomotive to the front was quite time consuming. Similarly the desire to make up time had to be tempered by the limitation on maximum speed due to the additional locomotive. Classes 46, 47 and 50 have been recorded assisting HSTs in this manner, and running up to 100 mph along the Exe Estuary between Exeter and Dawlish Warren was not unheard of; the engine was typically attached at Exeter as there was usually a locomotive available at the stabling point. There was little need for this procedure in the up direction as a spare power car was normally available at Laira, even if it had to be turned on the triangle at Laira Junction/Mount Gould Junction/Lipson Junction first.|$|R

5000|$|From 1963 to 1970 the Wildcat was its own series, {{no longer}} an Invicta subseries. The 1963 model had a large {{aluminum}} trim panel {{on the side of}} the body that seemed to compete directly with the Oldsmobile Starfire, another full-size [...] "sporty" [...] model by GM. Wildcats built in the 1964 model year did not have the traditional horizontal VentiPorts like other Buicks, but instead had vertically situated chrome hash-marks on the <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> quarter <b>panel</b> directly behind the front wheel housings. After becoming its own full series in 1963, the Wildcat added a convertible and four-door hardtop sedan to the original two-door hardtop coupe introduced in 1962. In the four-door version, a bench seat was standard but the bucket seat and console interior used in the coupe and convertible were optional. In 1964, a pillared four-door sedan was added to the line and two levels of trim were available - standard and custom, with a mid-line deluxe subseries added for 1965 only. From 1966 to 1969, the base (with trim similar to the 1965 Wildcat deluxe) and custom trims were again the sole options.|$|R
