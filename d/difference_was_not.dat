25|$|In Montenegro, a People's Party {{was formed}} in 1907 as the country's first {{political}} party and remained {{the largest in the}} period of country's parliamentary history until the Yugoslavian unification. Later a True People's Party was formed, which never got widespread popular support and whose bigger part had joined the original NS, but the <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> ideological, but opposition and support of the Crown and, sometimes, in foreign relations to Serbia (the clubbists were the crown's dissidents and supporters of the people as well as Serbia as a regional power and brotherly ally; the rightists were generally anti-democratic and autocratic monarchist, and also distrustful to the Serbian government's acts on the national plan).|$|E

500|$|Although sexual {{dimorphism}} in bill {{shape is}} found in other birds, such as the riflebirds, sicklebills and other wood-excavating birds including some species of woodpecker, it was most pronounced in the huia. The beak of the male was short at approximately [...] and slightly arched downwards and robust, {{very similar to that}} of the closely related saddleback, while the female's beak was finer, longer at around , and decurved (curved downward) like that of a hummingbird or honeyeater. The <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> only in the bone; the rhamphotheca grew way past the end of the bony maxilla and mandible to produce a pliable implement able to deeply penetrate holes made by wood-boring beetle larvae. The skulls and mandibles of the huia and saddleback are very similar, the latter essentially miniatures of the former.|$|E
500|$|England {{was facing}} the {{prospect}} of setting a new record for the lowest Test innings score at Trent Bridge, worse than the 112 made by England against Warwick Armstrong's Australians in 1921. However, a late fightback averted the unwanted record. Laker and Bedser, both from Surrey, joined forces and scored {{more than half of}} England's total, adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes. Laker's innings was highlighted by hooking and driving, while Bedser defended stoutly and drove in front of the wicket, much to the delight of the Nottingham crowd, who had appeared to have become depressed by the collapse of England's batsmen. At first, Bradman did not appear concerned by the partnership between the two bowlers from Surreyit was thought the Australian captain may have been happy for England to continue batting so his top order would not have to bat in fading light {{towards the end of the}} afternoon, but he became anxious as the total continued to mount and both Bedser and Laker appeared comfortable. O'Reilly speculated that both players had batted confidently as their home ground in SurreyThe Ovalhad a reputation for being batsman-friendly, and that as they would have had to contend with opposition batsmen who had the benefit of consistently favourable conditions, then they should also prepare so they too could capitalise on their opportunities with the willow. According to English commentator John Arlott, the playing surface was easier for batting than it had been at the start of the day, [...] "but the <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> such as to cause hesitation in the best batsmen in England".|$|E

2500|$|Reviewing {{his work}} on the hypothalamus, LeVay defends his 1991 study from the {{criticism}} that the differences in brain structure between gay and straight men which it found were simply a side-effect of AIDS, which all the gay men in the study had died from. LeVay writes that there was no obvious pathology in the specimens he studied and that he was subsequently able to study a gay man who died of factors unrelated to AIDS and found that his INAH 3 was the same size as those of the gay men in his study. LeVay notes that one attempt has been made to replicate his study. Psychiatrist and neuroscientist William Byne found a difference in INAH 3 size between gay and straight men, but the <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> quite statistically significant by the criteria Byne used.

2500|$|A {{study on}} hookah smoking and cancer in Pakistan was {{published}} in 2008. Its objective was [...] "to find serum CEA levels in ever/exclusive hookah smokers, i.e. those who smoked only hookah (no cigarettes, bidis, etc.), prepared between 1 and 4 times a day with a quantity of up to 120 g of a tobacco-molasses mixture each (i.e. the tobacco weight equivalent of up to 60 cigarettes of 1 g each) and consumed in 1 to 8 sessions". Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a marker found in several forms of cancer. Levels in exclusive hookah smokers were lower compared to cigarette smokers although the <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> as statistically significant as that between a hookah smoker and a non-smoker. Also, the study concluded that heavy hookah smoking (2–4 daily preparations; 3–8 sessions a day >2 hrs to ≤ 6 hours) substantially raises CEA levels. Hookah smokers were nearly 6 {{times more likely to}} develop lung cancer as compared to healthy non-smokers in Kashmir (India).|$|E

The <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> of Dutch origin, for it was just as apparent in New Jersey or Pennsylvania as in New York, and I think it may be attributed to a very obvious consequence of a general equality of condition, a state of society in which no one is content to wear even the semblance of poverty, but those who cannot by any means prevent it; but, in which all strive to get as high as possible, in appearances at least.--EDITOR.] ...|$|E
