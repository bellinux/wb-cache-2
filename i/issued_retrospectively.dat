25|$|The {{design of}} the man-carrying machine known as a Rotachute, {{also known as a}} Hafner H.8, evolved from November 1940 and {{throughout}} 1941. In September 1941, the Central Landing Establishment was renamed the Airborne Forces Establishment. The Rotachute Mark I design initially comprised a tubular steel framework with a single seat, rubber-mounted rotor hub, hanging control column, skid undercarriage, and a self-inflating rear fairing made of rubberised fabric with integral tailplane. The two rotor blades, of wooden construction, could achieve flapping and coning characteristics via hinges on the rotor hub. Fixed footrests were provided, plus fittings below the seat to accommodate a soldier's weapon, such as a Bren gun. The control column offered two-axis control, rolling and pitching, with turns made via controlled rolling movement. Air Ministry Specification No. 11/42 was <b>issued</b> <b>retrospectively</b> to describe the outline requirements. The Ministry of Aircraft Production sub-contracted construction of parts to specialist firms including F. Hills and Sons, Airwork General Trading, Dynaflex, Dunlop, and H. Morris & Co. Some full size rotor trials were carried out using a pivoting rig mounted on a Ford flatbed truck, and full-size unmanned airframes were used in ground-based and inflight trials.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fludarabine (FAMP) is {{the most}} active single agent in relapsed and {{refractory}} patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). However, {{it is not clear}} whether it should be used immediatly after failure of chlorambucil (CLB). We addressed such an <b>issue</b> <b>retrospectively</b> analyzing a series of patients in whom FAMP was used as third-line therapy after a sequential use of CLB and CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or CHOP-like regimen, respectively. DESIGN AND METHODS: On a retrospective basis, 57 B-CLL patients fulfilling the above mentioned criteria and followed-up in seven different hematologic institutions, were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 57 patients who were evaluated for response, 3 (5. 2 %) achieved a complete response (CR), 30 (52. 6 %) had a partial response (PR) and the remaining 24 (42. 1 %) failed to respond to FAMP. Overall median survival from the start of FAMP therapy was 30 months. Survival by tumor response did not show any difference between responders and non-responders (p = 0. 536). The survival was significantly shorter in the group of patients with progressive disease than in all other patients included in our study (p = 0. 05). Using each patient as his own control (McNemar test) we attempted to evaluate the value of FAMP in inducing a therapeutic response after failure of previous therapies. Among the 37 patients resistant to CLB the response rate was 40. 3 % with FAMP (p = 0. 037) and only 17. 5 % with CHOP (p = 1. 0). Among 35 patients resistant to a CHOP-like regimen, the response rate was 29. 8 % (p = 0. 066) after FAMP therapy. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: From our results, it seems that FAMP works better than a CHOP-like regimen in patients resistant to CLB although results do not translate into a survival advantage for responders...|$|R

It is not known whether de novo use of SRL is a risk factor for proteinuria. We analyzed a series of patients included in a big multicenter randomized trial (RMR trial) corresponding to all patients in Spain and Portugal with respect to this <b>issue.</b> We <b>retrospectively</b> evaluated 24 -hour proteinuria in all the patients during the study period (5 years postransplant) for comparison between treatment arms group A, continuous cyclosporine (CyA) + SRL and group B SRL with CyA elimination at 3 months postransplant. The elimination of CyA after the third month was not followed by significant changes in proteinuria. Nevertheless, during the last year of follow-up (between 48 and 60 months postransplant) an impressive increase in proteinuria was observed in group A. This surprising finding seemed to be a consequence of a protocol amendment that recommended CyA elimination in patients of group A, due to poorer results in the intermediate analysis of the trial. This fact suggests that the hemodynamic changes induced by elimination of the vasoconstrictor CyA might be responsible for the proteinuria but only in the long term probably when significant pathological lesions are already present.

For this purpose only patients with a prior resection of the primary tumour were considered. The clinical and pathological characteristics associated with poor prognosis that we observed more often in patients with synchronous metastases (n= 280) concerned an abnormal serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration (P= 0. 01), a worse WHO performance status (P= 0. 02), primary tumour localisation in the colon (P= 0. 002) and a higher T stage (P= 0. 0006).

Data of 381 {{patients who received}} unrelated CBT from 18 medical centers in Korea were reviewed. PES was defined as unexplained fever > 38. 3 °C not associated with infection, and/or unexplained skin rash with or without evidence of fluid retention before neutrophil recovery. PES developed in 102 patients (26. 8 %) at a median of 7 days after CBT. Of these patients, 74 patients (72. 5 %) received intravenous corticosteroid at a median dose of 1 mg/kg/day, and of these, 95 % showed clinical improvement. Risk factors for developing PES included low risk disease, myeloablative conditioning, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis without methotrexate or corticosteroid, and > 5. 43 x 107 /kg infused nucleated cells.

Clinical conditions with concomitant hypercalciuria and/or incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis are almost invariably associated with bone disease, making osteopathy highly likely in MSK, too. Patients with MSK have never been investigated for osteopathy; neither has the potential effect of potassium citrate administration (CA) on their urinary metabolic risk factors and on bone mineralization. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: These <b>issues</b> were <b>retrospectively</b> analyzed in 75 patients with MSK and primary stone risk factor (PSRF; hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, hyperuricosuria, and/or hyperoxaluria) on an outpatient basis; 65 received CA (2. 9 +/- 0. 8 g/d), whereas 10 received only general "stone clinic" suggestions. The 24 -h urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, oxalate, uric acid, and citrate; morning urine pH; serum biochemistry; and bone mineral density were investigated at baseline {{and at the end}} of follow-up (78 +/- 13 and 72 +/- 15 mo in groups A and B, respectively). RESULTS: CA led to a significant rise in urinary pH and citrate and decreased urinary calcium and phosphate (all P < 0. 001). Patients with MSK and PSRF had reduced bone density.

Incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis, hypocitraturia, and hypercalciuria are common. For stone prevention, patients with MSK generally receive the standard "stone clinic" recommendations and often receive potassium citrate (KC). However, the effect on stone recurrence of citrate treatment in these patients has never been studied. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, &# 38; MEASUREMENTS: The <b>issue</b> was <b>retrospectively</b> analyzed on an outpatient basis in 97 patients with a radiologic diagnosis of MSK: 65 {{had at least one}} stone risk factor (SRF; hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, hyperuricosuria, hyperoxaluria) and received KC [29 +/- 8 (SD) mEq/d]; 10 patients with SRF and 22 without received only general stone clinic suggestions. Follow-up was 78 +/- 13, 72 +/- 15, and 83 +/- 14 months, respectively. The 24 -hour urinary excretion of calcium, oxalate, uric acid, citrate, and morning urine pH were investigated at baseline {{and at the end of}} follow-up. RESULTS: Parallel to a significant rise in urinary citrate and decreased urinary calcium (all P < 0. 001), KC led to a dramatic reduction in the stone event rate (from 0. 58 to 0. 10 stones/yr per patient). The existence of a group of patients with MSK, those without SRF, with a very low stone rate and no SRF was recognized.

Antifungal prophylaxis shortly after transplantation is therefore indicated, but data for pediatric patients under 12 years of age are scarce. To address this <b>issue,</b> we <b>retrospectively</b> assessed the safety, feasibility, and initial efficacy of prophylactic posaconazole in children. Methods 60 consecutive pediatric patients with a median age of 6. 0 years who underwent allogeneic HSCT between August 2007 and July 2010 received antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole in the outpatient setting. 28 pediatric patients received an oral suspension at 5 mg/kg body weight b. i. d., and 32 pediatric patients received the suspension at 4 mg/kg body weight t. i. d. The observation period lasted from start of treatment with posaconazole until its termination (maximum of 200 days post-transplant). Results Pediatric patients who received posaconazole at 4 mg/kg body weight t. i. d. had a median trough level of 383 μg/L. Patients who received posaconazole at 5 mg/kg body weight b. i. d. had a median trough level of 134 μg/L. Both regimens were well tolerated without severe side effects. In addition, no proven or probable invasive mycosis was observed. Conclusion Posaconazole was a well-tolerated, safe, and effective oral antifungal prophylaxis in pediatric patients who underwent high-dose chemotherapy and HSCT. Posaconazole at a dosage of 12 mg/kg body weight divided in three doses produced consistently higher morning trough levels than in patients who received posaconazole 5 mg/kg body weight b. i. d.

40|$|Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) is {{the most}} common {{neoplasm}} in patients with AIDS. Epidemiologic evidence and the recent identification of herpesvirus-like DNA sequences in patients with KS have suggested a role for viral agents in the etiopathogenesis of this disease. It is unclear if these sequences are present in all types of KS and if the copy number of these sequences has a correlation with disease severity (staging). In order to clarify these <b>issues,</b> we <b>retrospectively</b> analyzed, by PCR and Southern blotting, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens from 12 patients previously diagnosed with KS by histopathologic examination of these specimens between the years of 1977 and 1996. We also analyzed tissue samples from these patients taken from dermal sites without KS lesions and control tissues from healthy subjects. Of the 12 patients, 6 had classic KS, 5 had AIDS-associated KS, and 1 had the endemic type of KS. We tested the specimens for other herpesviruses, including cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV- 6), HHV- 7, HHV- 8, and Epstein-Barr virus. Of 20 biopsy specimens from patients previously diagnosed with KS, 19 were positive for HHV- 8 sequences (95 %), while PCR for the DNAs of other herpesvirus agents was negative. Uninvolved tissue from these patients and control tissue from healthy subjects gave negative results for all viruses. Semiquantitative analysis of Southern blots showed higher levels of HHV- 8 DNA in those patients with multicentric and visceral involvement than in those patients with localized involvement. In addition, in patients with localized skin disease, the nodular stage had higher levels of HHV- 8 DNA than the patch or plaque stages.

40|$|AbstractA {{significant}} {{cost reduction}} is likely if patients who require {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting with significant carotid stenosis have simultaneous carotid endarterectomy and bypass grafting, provided risk is not increased. To investigate this <b>issue,</b> we <b>retrospectively</b> identified cases from February 1977 to May 1994 with first-time isolated carotid endarterectomy, coronary bypass, or combined procedures. In the isolated carotid endarterectomy population, median age was 69 years and 58 % (85 / 146) were male, as compared with 68 years and 68 % (68 / 100) male in the combined group; median age of the coronary bypass cohort was 65 years and 76 % (381 / 500) male. A significantly higher percentage of patients in the coronary bypass versus combined group were in New York Heart Association functional class IV. In the combined group there was a significantly higher incidence of older age, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, renal failure, and congestive heart failure. There was no difference among the three groups with respect to hospital mortality (0 %, 3. 4 %, and 4. 0 %, respectively) and permanent stroke (0. 7 %, 1. 2 %, and 0 %, respectively). Hospital costs were $ 4, 896, $ 10, 959 and $ 11, 089, respectively, with a savings of $ 4, 766 (30 %), and Medicare hospital reimbursement was $ 8, 575, $ 23, 071, and $ 23, 071, respectively, with a savings of $ 10, 077 (25. 3 %).

On the other hand, rural-urban {{differences in the}} OHCA survival rates are an important public health <b>issue.</b> We <b>retrospectively</b> reviewed the January 2011 -December 2013 OHCA registry data of Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. With particular focus on geospatial variables, we aimed to unveil risk factors predicting the overall OHCA survival until hospital admission. Spatial analysis, network analysis, and the Kriging method by using geographic information systems were applied to analyze spatial variations and calculate the transport distance. Logistic regression was used to identify the risk factors for OHCA survival. Among the 4, 957 patients, the overall OHCA survival to hospital admission was 16. 5 %. In the multivariate analysis, female sex (adjusted odds ratio:, AOR, 1. 24 [1. 06 - 1. 45]), events in public areas (AOR: 1. 30 [1. 05 - 1. 61]), exposure to automated external defibrillator (AED) shock (AOR: 1. 70 [1. 30 - 2. 23]), use of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) (AOR: 1. 35 [1. 16 - 1. 58]), non-trauma patients (AOR: 1. 41 [1. 04 - 1. 90]), ambulance bypassed the closest hospital (AOR: 1. 28 [1. 07 - 1. 53]), and OHCA within the high population density areas (AOR: 1. 89 [1. 55 - 2. 32]) were positively associated with improved OHCA survival. By contrast, a prolonged total emergency medical services (EMS) time interval was negatively associated with OHCA survival (AOR: 0. 98 [0. 96 - 0. 99]). Resuscitative efforts, such as AED or LMA use, and a short total EMS time interval improved OHCA outcomes in emergency departments. The spatial heterogeneity of emergency medical resources between rural and urban areas might affect survival rate...|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{overload}} is {{a well-known}} predictor of mortality in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Multifrequency bioimpedance analysis (MF-BIA) is a promising tool for quantifying volume status. However, few studies have analyzed the effect of MF-BIA-defined volume status on the mortality of critically ill patients with AKI. This retrospective medical research study aimed to investigate this <b>issue.</b> We <b>retrospectively</b> reviewed the medical records of patients with AKI who underwent continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) from Jan. 2013 to Feb. 2014. Female patients were excluded to control for sex-based differences. Volume status was measured using MF-BIA (Inbody S 20, Seoul, Korea) {{at the time of}} CVVHDF initiation, and volume parameters were adjusted with height squared (H 2). Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to test independent factors for prediction of in-hospital mortality. A total of 208 male patients were included in this study. The mean age was 65. 19 ± 12. 90 years. During the mean ICU stay of 18. 29 ± 27. 48 days, 40. 4 % of the patients died. The in-hospital mortality rate increased with increasing total body water (TBW) /H 2 quartile. In the multivariable analyses, increased TBW/H 2 (OR 1. 312 (1. 009 - 1. 705), p= 0. 043) and having lower serum albumin (OR 0. 564 (0. 346 - 0. 919, p= 0. 022) were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality. When the intracellular water (ICW) /H 2 or extracellular water (ECW) /H 2 was adjusted instead of the TBW/H 2, only excess ICW/H 2 was independently associated with increased mortality (OR 1. 561 (1. 012 - 2. 408, p= 0. 044). MF-BIA-defined excess TBW/H 2 and ICW/H 2 are independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality in male patients with AKI undergoing CVVHDF...|$|R
40|$|The {{prognostic}} role of CD 15 {{in acute}} myeloid leukemia (AML) has been tested in different studies with conflicting results. To address this <b>issue,</b> we <b>retrospectively</b> evaluated a cohort of 460 AML patients of all ages with the exclusion of acute promyelocytic leukemia (M/F 243 / 217, median age 50. 6  years [range 0. 9 - 81. 2]) intensively treated at our institute between January 1999 and December 2010. CD 15 positivity was found in 171 of 406 evaluable patients (42. 1 %). Complete remission (CR) was achieved by 334 patients (72. 6 %), while 82 (17. 8 %) were resistant and 44 (9. 6 %) died during induction: the median CR duration was 15. 5  months (range 0. 6 - 176. 0), with 2 -year disease-free survival rate of 45. 1 % (95 % confidence interval 39. 6 - 50. 6). The median overall survival was 14. 4  months (range 0. 3 - 177. 0), with 2 -year overall survival rate of 42. 2 % (95 % confidence interval 37. 5 - 46. 9). At univariate analysis for CR achievement, age    8  g/dL (P = . 020), and white blood cell <  50  ×  10 (9) /L (P = . 034) had a favorable impact. At a multivariate logistic regression model, CD 15 positivity (P = . 002), age <  60  years (P = . 008), white blood cell <  50  ×  10 (9) /L (P = . 017), and low-risk/no high-risk karyotype (P = . 026 /P = . 025) retained an independent prognostic role on CR achievement. The baseline assessment of CD 15 positivity {{appears to have a}} role in the risk evaluation for CR achievement in AML patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy and should be assessed in prospective studies together with other clinical and biologic features already reported...|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{duration}} of treatment with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) after venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) is uncertain. To tackle this <b>issue,</b> we <b>retrospectively</b> studied 206 patients with MPN-related VTE (deep venous thrombosis of the legs and/or pulmonary embolism). After this index event, we recorded over 695 pt-years 45 recurrences, venous in 36 cases, with an incidence rate (IR) of 6. 5 per 100 pt-years (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 4. 9 – 8. 6). One hundred fifty-five patients received VKA; the IR of recurrent thrombosis per 100 pt-years was 4. 7 (95 % CI: 2. 8 – 7. 3) on VKA and 8. 9 (95 % CI: 5. 7 – 13. 2) off VKA (P= 0. 03). In patients receiving VKA, the IR of recurrent thrombosis per 100 pt-years was 5. 3 (95 % CI: 3. 2 – 8. 4) among 108 patients on long-term VKA and 12. 8 (95 % CI: 7. 3 – 20. 7) after discontinuation among the 47 who ceased treatment (P= 0. 008), with a doubled risk of recurrence after stopping VKA (hazard ratio: 2. 21, 95 % CI: 1. 19 – 5. 30). The IR of major bleeding per 100 pt-years was 2. 4 (95 %: CI: 1. 1 – 4. 5) on VKA and 0. 7 (95 % CI: 0. 08 – 2. 5) off VKA (P= 0. 08). In conclusion, in MPN patients with VTE recurrent thrombosis is significantly reduced by VKA and caution should be adopted in discontinuation; however, the incidence of recurrence on treatment remains high, calling for clinical trials aimed to improve prophylaxis in this setting.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} A {{debate has been}} ongoing whether non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) with neuroendocrine(NE) differentiation likely indicates malignant behavior, poor prognosis, and sensitivity to chemotherapy. In response to this <b>issue,</b> we <b>retrospectively</b> investigated NE differentiation in NSCLC patients who underwent anatomical pulmonary surgery. Methods A total of 274 patients who met the inclusion criteria through January 2000 to December 2008 were enrolled in this study because they had the detailed material and enough paraffin tumor samples for tissue microarray. The recommended antibody panel consisted of CgA, Syn, NCAM, Leu- 7, PGP 9. 5, and MAP- 2. We also counted Ki- 67 in the tissues to present the nuclear proliferation index. The Kaplan–Meier estimator and the Cox proportional hazard model multivariate analysis were applied to observe the relationship between NE differentiation and postoperative survival of the patients. Results The Cox analysis of different NE score combinations on the prognosis of NSCLC after surgical treatment did not reach statistical significance (score 1, score 2, and score≥ 3 vs score 0, P= 0. 527; score 0 vs score ≥ 1, P= 0. 791; score< 2 vs score≥ 2, P= 0. 163; score< 3 vs score≥ 3, P= 0. 293). The Kaplan–Meier estimator did not give {{significant difference in the}} survival of NE score combinations in each pTNM layer. In the perioperative chemotherapy group, we also did not find a positive correlation for the survival analysis of NE score combinations (score 1, score 2, and score≥ 3 vs score 0, P= 0. 692; score 0 vs score≥ 1, P= 0. 922; score< 2 vs score ≥ 2, P= 0. 264; score< 3 vs score≥ 3, P= 0. 484). Conclusion The NE differentiation of NSCLC reflects some structure and functional characteristics of NELT, although it cannot be used as an independent factor of biological behavior and survival for NSCLC patients who underwent surgery in our group...|$|R
