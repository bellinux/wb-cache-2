One of the most common dishes with <b>kashkaval</b> is kashkavalka which is a little pastry containing <b>kashkaval</b> inside and on top. Like in the other Balkan countries, it is a major substitute for all other kinds of cheese, especially in pizzas.

5000|$|<b>Kashkaval</b> {{is a type}} {{of yellow}} cheese made of cow milk (<b>kashkaval</b> vitosha), sheep milk (<b>kashkaval</b> balkan), or both (<b>kashkaval</b> preslav). The name is derived from the Italian {{caciocavallo}} (cașcaval; кашкавал, кашкавал, качкаваљ or kačkavalj; Kaçkavalli; kaşkaval/kaşar; قشقوان‎‎ / qashqawān). In Albania, Bulgaria, Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Romania, the term is often used to refer to all yellow cheeses (or even any cheese other than sirene). In English-language menus in Bulgaria, [...] "кашкавал" [...] is translated as [...] "yellow cheese" [...] (whereas sirene is usually translated as [...] "white cheese" [...] or simply [...] "cheese").|$|E

5000|$|The name <b>kashkaval</b> {{comes from}} Latin caseus (cheese) and caballus (horse). According this theory for the Italian name caciocavallo, the widely {{accepted}} {{explanation of the}} word [...] "cavallo" [...] (horse in English) comes from the cheese being traditionally dried by attaching two gourd shaped balls of caciocavallo with a single rope and hanging them to a wooden pole as if placed on a horse's back.|$|E

40|$|Model samples <b>kashkaval</b> cheese {{were made}} by the {{microwave}} processing of cow's milk in thermisation mode (62 - 67 °C) and direct microwave treatment of cheddared curd with subsequent dry salting. Control cheese samples were produced by the conventional approach with classical thermisation (62 - 67 °C) of cow's milk and classic hot brining in brine solution (72 - 74 °C, 14 %NaCl). Samples were placed in ripening conditions (8 - 10 °C). The changes of microbiological and proteolytic profile on the 5 th, 15 th, 30 th and 45 th day of ripening were studied. Higher survival levels of the starter culture responsible for ripening were established in <b>kashkaval</b> cheese produced by microwave treatment in comparison with classical cheese. It was found that the higher cell concentration of the starter culture leads to active and accelerate process of proteolysis with production of free amino acids in concentrations significantly exceeding the obtained in the classical cheese: 490, 10 ± 2, 10 mg 100 g- 1 (microwave <b>kashkaval</b> cheese) versus 216, 50 ± 2, 00 mg 100 g- 1 (classical <b>kashkaval</b> cheese) ...|$|E

This product contains a unique added value and involves several innovational opportunities. I examined the complex economic analysis of the innovations and technological elements investigated with respect to revenues from the sale of sheep milk, sheep cheese (<b>kashkaval)</b> and sheep kefir. The kashkaval-type sheep cheese does not contain sufficient added value to cover the costs of innovational investments. Investigating the innovational activity for developing sheep kefir and for its market introduction, its cash flow balance becomes positive already in the second year after realization, and is able to generate significant profit. sheep breeding, innovation, recovery calculation, sheep kefir, sheep milk production, Livestock Production/Industries, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|E
