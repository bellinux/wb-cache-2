In this Bachelor’s Degree Final Project we study the Groebner <b>fan</b> <b>of</b> a polynomial ideal, including the proof by Fukuda, Jensen and Thomas {{that it is}} a polyhedral complex consisting of polyhedral cones.

On the other hand, we will introduce toric ideals associated with integer matrices and regular triangulations of the latter. We will continue by studying the secondary <b>fan</b> <b>of</b> a toric ideal, whose maximal dimension cones correspond to regular triangulations of the associated matrix. Moreover, we will see that the Grobner <b>fan</b> <b>of</b> a toric ideal is a polyhedral subdivision <b>of</b> its secondary <b>fan.</b> Finally, we will focus on the existence of the secondary polytope of a homogeneous toric ideal, whose normal fan is the secondary <b>fan.</b> Regular triangulations <b>of</b> a matrix, the secondary <b>fan</b> <b>of</b> a toric ideal and its secondary polytope were originally introduced by Gelfand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky in 1989.
