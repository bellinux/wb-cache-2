5|$|The {{exterior}} of Kazakhstan nuclear facility {{was shot at}} the Bardenas Reales, in Navarre, Spain, and the <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oil refinery control centre at the Motorola building in Groundwell, Swindon. The <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oil pipeline was filmed in Cwm Dyli, Snowdonia, Wales, while the production teams shot the oil pipeline explosion in Hankley Common, Elstead, Surrey. Istanbul, Turkey, was indeed used in the film and Elektra King's Baku villa was actually in the city, also using the famous Maiden's Tower which was used as Renard's hideout in Turkey. The underwater submarine scenes were filmed in The Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|A {{blacksmith}} shop does {{occupy the}} current John Deere Historic Site grounds. Archaeologists used a magnetometer {{to locate the}} position of the forge in the original blacksmith shop, thus, the current shop shares an interior which is an exact replica of the original. The <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building has the same dimensions as the original as well.|$|E

In February 2009, the city noted that plans had been designed to renovate both the interior and <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mall.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{predominantly}} military character, {{the castle}} {{is one of}} the few sites where Crusader art (in the form of frescoes) has been preserved. In 1935, 1955, and 1978 medieval frescoes were discovered within Krak des Chevaliers after later plaster and white-wash had decayed. The frescos were painted on the interior and <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main chapel and the chapel outside the main entrance, which no longer survives. Writing in 1982, historian Jaroslav Folda noted that at the time there had been little investigation of Crusader frescoes that would provide a comparison for the fragmentary remains found at Krak des Chevaliers. Those in the chapel were painted on the masonry from the 1170–1202 rebuild. Mold, smoke, and moisture have made it difficult to preserve the frescoes. The fragmentary nature of the red and blue frescoes inside the chapel means they are difficult to assess. The one on the <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapel depicted the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple.|$|E
50|$|Although the 25th {{episode in}} the series, A Sentimental Journey was the 5th episode to be shot, filmed between July and September 1968.The <b>exteriors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convent in the episode were shot at Grim's Dyke.|$|R
50|$|As {{usual in}} other similar Flemish works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, <b>the</b> <b>exteriors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{shutters}} are painted in grisaille. By tradition, in many churches artworks are covered, and altarpieces with wings are {{closed in the}} week before Easter. The subdued coloration and <b>the</b> subject matter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shutter <b>exteriors</b> <b>of</b> this triptych are {{in keeping with the}} Lenten theme.|$|R

5|$|During the 1820s and 1830s buildings, {{including}} houses, {{shops and}} taverns which {{were very close}} to or actually touching {{the walls of the}} abbey were demolished and the interior remodelled by George Phillips Manners who was the Bath City Architect. Manners erected flying buttresses to the <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave and added pinnacles to the turrets.|$|E
5|$|Holy Trinity Church on Boar Lane was {{constructed}} between 1721 and 1727, built to a design by William Etty. It is a Grade I listed building. The building {{has not changed}} much (although a new steeple was built in 1839 by R D Chantrell), but developments such as the Burton Arcade and the Leeds Shopping Plaza have been built so close {{that it is difficult}} to see the full <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building as was once possible.|$|E
5|$|Interior {{scenes were}} filmed at The Paint Hall studio, in Belfast, {{including}} all the scenes set in the Red Keep and Winterfell. The <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stark and Lannister war camps were shot on location in the Castle Ward estate, {{near the village of}} Strangford. Audley's Castle in the estate doubled as the ruined remains of one of Moat Cailin's towers, seen when Catelyn and Rodrik join Robb's army.|$|E
2500|$|Just as {{we build}} {{differential}} forms out <b>of</b> <b>exterior</b> powers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cotangent bundle, {{we can build}} <b>exterior</b> powers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complexified cotangent bundle (which is canonically isomorphic to <b>the</b> bundle <b>of</b> dual spaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complexified tangent bundle).

There are two terraces on the <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building and the inside also has a kitchen area.|$|E
5|$|The barn {{was built}} {{sometime}} around 1871, possibly even before, and is constructed {{of the same}} soft brick that makes up the <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home. Tradition in the Glidden family holds that the barn, like the house itself, was designed and built by prominent local carpenter Jacob Haish. The famous barn, one of DeKalb County's oldest remaining, stands a full two-stories high, measuring around 50feet (15m) tall, with a width of 30feet (9m).|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was altered in 1890, with two additions of Victorian architecture, the first being the main entrance, above the fanlight, is an arched awning with incised consoles. The other addition was the octagonal cupola {{on the roof}} over the original bell tower which dates from 1830. The <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school has complementary colors. The walls are painted a cream color while the foundation, doors, window trims, and cornices are a chocolate-brown.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> k-th <b>exterior</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cotangent space, denoted Λk(T'x*M), {{is another}} {{important}} object in differential geometry. Vectors in the kth exterior power, or more precisely sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> k-th <b>exterior</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cotangent bundle, are called differential k-forms.

As well, interiors for the BBC's Jamaica Inn, for the BBC's Remember Me and for ITV series Black Work, were also filmed at the studios. More recently, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exteriors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BBC series Jericho were filmed at the nearby Rockingstone Quarry and some interior work was done at North Light Film Studios.|$|R
5|$|The {{crew members}} also {{checked out the}} Advanced Space Vision System, a precise {{alignment}} system for the robot arm that was tested on STS-74. The OSVS, which was used during the mating operation, consisted {{of a series of}} large dots placed on the <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> docking module and the docking system.|$|E
5|$|The <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baroque styled {{tabernacle}} {{is almost}} entirely adorned with decorations, such as curiously shaped niche shelves, floating drapes and many cherubs. Carvings of fruits such as grapes and pomegranates have been created to {{in the shape of}} ritual offerings, symbolizing the Blood of Christ and the Church. Among the floral elements, roses, daisies, and various types of four-petalled flowers can be found, including the indigenous chalchihuite.|$|E
5|$|The <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Albert Hall (built in 1867–1871 to {{the designs}} of Francis Fowke and Henry Young Darracott Scott) is embellished with a mosaic frieze {{composed}} of sixteen separate designs by multiple artists.

500|$|The bats {{were entirely}} {{composed}} of computer-generated imagery {{since it was}} decided directing real bats on set would be problematic. The Penguin's [...] "bird army" [...] {{was a combination of}} CGI, robotic creatures, men in suits and even real penguins. Robotic penguin puppets were commissioned by Stan Winston. In total 30 African penguins and 12 king penguins were used. A miniature effect was used for <b>the</b> <b>exteriors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cobblepot Mansion in the opening scene and for Wayne Manor. The same method was used for the Bat Ski-boat and <b>the</b> <b>exterior</b> shots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gotham Zoo.|$|R

Depending on <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> bus, <b>the</b> <b>exteriors</b> have space for King Signs (139 x 30 in), Busboards (70 x 21 in) and Custom Signs (55 x 36 in). <b>The</b> City <b>of</b> Cornwall generates revenue by tendering the exclusive right {{to place the}} {{advertising on}} the buses to a contractor.|$|R
5|$|The <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} is clad in multi-coloured slate collected from Welsh slate quarries. Narrow windows are {{built into the}} layers of slate {{to give the impression}} of rock; strata they depict the different stone layers in sea cliffs. The purple slate came from the Penrhyn Quarry, the blue from Cwt y Bugail Quarry, the green from the Nantlle Valley, the grey from Llechwedd quarry, and the black from the Corris Quarry.|$|E
5|$|The <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{observatory}} {{building has}} a brick cornice, with stone sills and lintels, stone water course, ornamental gutters, and original copper downspouts.

The original front balustrade has been replaced, however, the western stoop and ornamental iron balustrade is still original.|$|E
5|$|The <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temple is richly decorated. The frieze {{depicts a}} {{continuous}} line of acanthus. Furthermore, there are ornaments on the capital, architrave, and soffit. The stones {{in the front}} cornice have projecting sculptures of lion heads.
