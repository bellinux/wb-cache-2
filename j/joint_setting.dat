In this paper, we study the <b>joint</b> <b>setting</b> of these parameters {{in order to}} maximize capacity and optimize performance under QoS constraints. We first revisit the analytical modeling in saturation and non-saturation conditions and provide more detailed approximations of the mean channel access delay and throughput. Then, considering two classes of wireless stations with higher and lower QoS demands, and optimizing with respect to average measures and constraints, we provide Pareto optimal pairs for the number of supported stations from the two classes for different parameter set configurations and representative load values. Further, we examine optimal parameter selection for a class of elastic traffic, {{in the presence of a}} delay-sensitive class whose parameters are fixed. Our findings show that drastic service differentiation can undermine capacity of a WLAN. They also demonstrate the optimality of jointly setting high values for TXOP and AIFS {{in order to maximize}} the throughput of the elastic traffic class while guaranteeing delay of the delay-sensitive class.

40|$|Purpose: In this {{deliverable}} {{we report}} on the outcome of our efforts to combine our previous work on SaC compilation systems for data-parallel and functional concurrency on the Microgrid into a single joint back-end. We give an overview of the challenges we faced and the approaches we have developed. In particular we focus on resource management and concurrency mapping techniques. Furthermore, we give a brief outlook on future research directions. Results: In the context of resource management, we have implemented novel heap management and liveness analysis techniques. We show that solutions that are viable for either data-parallel or function concurrency in isolation are not applicable in a <b>joint</b> <b>setting.</b> We show how our previous approaches have to be extended to ensure scalability and runtime performance in a combined setting. For concurrency mapping, we have evaluated multiple schemes for functional concurrency, none of which leads to satisfying results in the general case. However, we have learned valuable lessons and do have a clearer understanding now of how a successful mapping strategy might look like. Conclusion: Handling functional concurrency efficiently is complex and poses many challenges not present in the data-parallel case. Yet, we have developed runtime solutions that allow us to efficiently execute programs that contain both. We have developed novel techniques tailored not only to the Microgrid but massively parallel architectures in general. Some questions, in particular means to find an efficient, scalable, yet adaptive mapping of functional concurrency to hardware resources, require further research.

40|$|Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) {{system is}} {{operated}} with cellular technology based on frequency reuse. Due to the co-channel interference between cells, one cell‟s performance is decided by not only its own configurations but also other cell‟s settings. Therefore, joint optimization of antenna parameters in LTE-A cellular networks {{is the key}} to maximizing coverage and capacity. This can be achieved by setting the antenna parameters such as azimuth orientations and tilts to the optimal values. Nevertheless, the large number of cell parameters and the interdependencies between these parameters make it difficult and time-consuming to optimize a cellular network. In practice, the <b>joint</b> <b>setting</b> of the parameters of all cells with irregular layout and coverage areas becomes an important and challenging task. There are several methods to search for the optimal settings of a cellular network. One commonly used search method is Simulated Annealing (SA). SA can produce good results in cellular network optimization, but {{it takes a long time}} and its performance can easily be degraded if the input parameters are misconfigured. Other methods include the trial-and-error approach that requires manual selection of parameter values and has no guarantee for good results, and the brute-force approach that searches through all possible combinations of parameter values and is thus computationally prohibitive. Among the various algorithms proposed for this time-consuming optimization task, the iterative approach based on the Taguchi method (TM) is a recent development that has been shown to be promising. This thesis presents some further improvements to the TM-based approach aiming at enhancing optimization performance and reducing computational complexity. The proposed improvements include the use of the mixedlevel Nearly-Orthogonal Array (NOA) to cater for the different optimization ranges of different types of parameters, an improved mapping function to select testing values that are more representative of the optimization range, and a hybrid approach using multiple NOAs with decreasing number of experiments to exchange small degradation in optimization performance for significant reduction in computational complexity.

40|$|The whole work on {{the role}} of {{institutions}} and social environment in economy is gathered under the general name of social capital. In a more precise way, we can consider one agent's social capital as a social resource, resulting from the cultural and/or structural interactions with other agents (any cluster is an agent), able to generate durable externalities which affect the economic situation of all of these agents. Consequently, the heart of the analysis resides in the relational character of the concept. Indeed, since these relations take place out-market, they can generate three externalities: learning about the behaviour of agents, learning about their environment, and collective action. The two first, which refer to the concept of information, are likely to improve the welfare of agents; it is fairly accepted in economy that a quantitative and/or qualitative improvement of information allows the agents to take more efficient decisions, because better adapted to the reality of the economic situation. Concerning the third externality, collective action, the <b>joint</b> <b>setting</b> of resources makes it possible to achieve goals which bring to each individual a higher utility than the one he would get from an individual action. This is the principle of economies of scale. According to this, social capital tends to be a fundamental asset for development, but this image is only partly true. In fact, it appeared that in certain cases social capital can generate negative externalities which support social exclusion. Moreover, certain shapes of social capital can, from their " perverse " nature (for example Mafia) hinder the development process. Hence, social capital seems to be an ambivalent concept, so that the recourse to statistical instruments appears necessary to rule on the primacy of an effect on the other. Two distinct levels of analysis are considered: the microeconomic framework and the macroeconomic one; but they both share the same (direct) methodology where social capital is the principal explanatory variable of a regression model. Generally, the econometric tests underline the role of this concept in incomes growth. Therefore, it appears that social capital needs more attention in the analysis of development, and in particular with regard to the study of poverty and inequalities. (Full text in French) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{prenatal}} or preconception {{genetic counseling}} {{may represent a}} key step for those who cope with reproductive choices in genetic risk situations (Kessler, 1997; Uhlmann, Schuette and Yashar, 2009; Freda, Zaccaro, Gleijeses and Politano, 2010). Over the last four decades, advances in genetic knowledge and the opportunities for geneticist to learn about their genetic risk have led to renegotiate notions, such as health and illness and, specifically, the conception of life and procreation which have several implications in ethical issues and in clinical practice. The current investigation focuses on ultimate experience of genetic counselling in prenatal or preconception setting. The aim is to explore the processes of significance {{about the consequences of}} communication of risk within one month to the end of genetic counseling intervention in order to hypothesize research-intervention projects which involve medical and psychological profession in a <b>joint</b> <b>setting.</b> Participants are all attending Cardiomyology and Medical Genetics counseling in Naples (Italy) for the first time. Transcripts of 18 semi-structured interviews were conducted and then analysed by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith, 2004; Smith, Flowers and Larkin, 2009). Through this approach, three super-ordinate themes were identified: the familiar outcomes of genetic counselling; the representation of risk and the vicissitudes of decision-making. In prenatal and reproductive scenarios, we hypothesize the sole choice to request genetic counseling can have several consequences on family and inter-/intra-generational ties. In such context, the counselor???s task is to introduce the information as a new source of sense-making and to accompany the use of this information so that the proband???s personal sense of control became more powerful, in managing the decision-making processes. In our opinion, the psychological function can {{play a central role in}} an integrated perspective with the medical function.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to quantitatively estimate the gaseous exchange of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) between a subarctic wetland ecosystem and the atmosphere. Additionally some initial estimates of the carbon input to the atmosphere of nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) were also obtained by combining different techniques in a <b>joint</b> <b>setting.</b> The data presented were collected at the Stordalen mire, a palsa type complex located in the northernmost part of subarctic Sweden (68 ° 20 ’N, 19 ° 03 ’E, alt. 363 m asl). This site represents an ecosystem type that is highly sensitive to climatic conditions, especially to the ongoing processes of climate warming. Recent studies performed in this area have shown that those ecosystems in northern Scandinavia are subject to dramatic changes, as the distribution of permafrost is diminishing and vegetation is changing, which has been triggered by warming over recent decades. These regional landscape changes are affecting the ecosystems carbon balance, and might determine whether these ecosystems will be classified as either greenhouse gas sources or sinks. In addition to the obtained estimates of the emission {{of the two major}} greenhouse gases (CO 2 and CH 4), the quantitative studies of NMHCs were derived by simultaneously performed chamber measurements coupled with total hydrocarbon (THC) analyses, and by applying a disjunct eddy covariance (DEC) technique to measure specific emissions of isolated biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) such as isoprene and methanol. The measured eddy covariance tower net ecosystem exchange (NEE) showed a strong and consistent annual uptake signal. During the years 2004 to 2008, with relatively comparable climates the annual NEE amounts to - 89 g CO 2 -C m- 2 y- 1, with very small variation. The eddy covariance (EC) tower acquired CH 4 flux measurements and showed a strong positive input to the annual carbon budget in the range of 18 - 22 g CH 4 -C m- 2 y- 1, reducing the studied ecosystem sink strength by almost 20 %. Additional positive budget components in the form of emission of NMHCs constitute roughly an additional 15 % to the CH 4 fluxes. This fraction may be compared with the EC CH 4 flux measurements emission rates and the results of the isoprene and methanol flux measurements obtained by the DEC method. Here the proportional atmospheric emission is estimated as 4 % and 1 % respectively for the above-mentioned components, indicating that other compounds must be responsible for {{a large proportion of the}} NMHC flux. By applying a global warming potential factor and calculating the annual balances expressed in CO 2 equivalent numbers converted according to a 100 year time horizon, the degrading parts of the Stordalen mire appear as a greenhouse warming source with a level of emission estimated at + 93 g CO 2 equiv. -C m- 2 y- 1.
