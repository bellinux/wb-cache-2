40|$|The {{manufacturing}} sector {{has gone through}} tremendous change in the last decade. We have witnessed the transformation from stand alone, manual processes to smart and integrated systems, from hand written reports to interactive computer-based dashboards. Future <b>integrated</b> <b>factories</b> will operate as a system of systems through intelligent machines, human factors integration, and integrated supply chains. To effectively operate and manage these emerging enterprises, a systems science approach is required. Modelling and simulation is recognised as a key enabling technology, with application from stakeholder engagement and knowledge elicitation to operational decision support through self-tuning and self-assembling simulations. Our research {{has led to the}} introduction of effective modelling and simulation methods and tools to enable real time planning, dynamic risk analysis and effective visualisation for production processes, resources and systems.

50|$|The Habsburg Monarchy, {{which then}} ruled the Banat, was {{interested}} in developing extractive metallurgy in the province, and began building furnaces for iron ore smelting in Reșița in 1769, those at Bocşa proving inadequate for its industrial needs.

40|$|In {{the latter}} half of the nineteenth century, {{increased}} immigration from eastern Europe and a growing garment industry in Baltimore led to vast growth in so-called sweatshops: cramped workspaces in which clothing was partially or completely sewn for market. As the sweatshops grew, <b>integrated</b> clothing <b>factories</b> were also emerging, finally becoming a real force in the Baltimore garment industry around the turn of the twentieth century. As the <b>integrated</b> <b>factories</b> grew, the workers joined in the growing organized labor movement, and then began to push for greater protections for the health and safety of workers, as well as fair wages. Among the most significant results of the organization of garment workers were the sweatshop laws passed in 1894, 1896, and 1902, which sought greater protection for the laborers in sweatshops, and through some of those protections, of the public health. The passage of these laws was achieved through efforts by both the garment workers unions, which sweatshop workers joined over this same stretch of time, and the state government officials who fought for the laws, namely Jacob Schonfarber, Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Industrial Statistics of Maryland. However, the enforcement regime enacted by the laws passed in the 1902 session of the Maryland General Assembly was viewed by many sweatshop operators as an undue intrusion upon private property rights and the right to work, and as providing authority to the inspectors without sufficient constraint upon their decision-making powers...|$|R

40|$|Cloud {{manufacturing}} is {{an emerging}} concept {{related to the}} management of flexible production networks such as virtual enterprises. It not only suggests management approaches such as service-orientation in manufacturing but also provides solutions for efficient execution of the production network management by means of IT tools. Such tools are in most cases represented by cloud manufacturing platforms to which the managed production facilities are connected. However, when <b>integrating</b> <b>factories</b> and their IT infrastructure to cloud manufacturing environments, considerable effort is necessary to implement appropriate IT interfaces. In order to overcome this issue, this paper suggests a concept for a configurable interface component, i. e. factory adapter, which enables to easily configure and execute data exchange between factory-internal IT systems with manufacturing clouds.

40|$|Resource {{portfolio}} {{planning is}} a frequent task in semiconductor wafer fabrication plants, as process, machine and product technologies evolve rapidly and the plants go through capacity expansion.

This paper describes a resource portfolio planning methodology for wafer fabrication foundry plants. An improved static capacity model is first presented. A portfolio planning procedure based on static capacity estimation and queuing analysis is next described. This procedure enables the solution space of resource portfolios to be explored effectively and has demonstrated a capability superior to the current planning method in an industry case study. A software implementation of the procedure {{is also used to}} clarify planning dilemmas. It is shown that empirical formu-lae can be used to estimate the efficiency of batch machines.
