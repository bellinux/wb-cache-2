40|$|Different {{types of}} {{models have been}} {{proposed}} {{in the recent years}} to examine different problems associated with induction motors. These models are from the simple equivalent circuit to complex d, q models and abc models which allow the inclusion of different forms of <b>impedance</b> and/or voltage <b>unbalance.</b> In the recent past, hybrid models have been developed which allow the inclusion of supply side unbalance but with the computational economy of the d, q models. Recently, there are so many applications in which induction motors are fed by static frequency inverters. Such applications are growing fast and a significant work in this field has already been done. However, still {{there are a lot of}} scopes left which may be used in this applications. This paper presents a dynamic model using PWM inverter and mathematical modelling of the motor. By using this model induction motor may be used as variable speed applications unlike conventional induction motors. The utilization of squirrel cage induction motors with electronic inverters presents greater advantages on cost and energy efficiency, compared with other industrial solutions for varying speed applications. The dynamic simulation of the small power induction motor is one of the key steps in the validation of the design process of the motor drive system and it is needed for eliminating in advertent design mistakes and the resulting error in the prototype construction and testing. This model is successfully used in the fault detection of rotor broken bar for the induction machines.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for studying electromechanical transients in power systems using three phase, combined {{transmission and distribution}} models (hybrid models). The methodology models individual phases of an electric network and associated unbalance in load and generation. Therefore, the impacts of load unbalance, single phase distributed generation and line <b>impedance</b> <b>unbalance</b> on electromechanical transients can be studied without using electromagnetic transient simulation (EMTP) programs. The implementation of this methodology in software is called the Three Phase Dynamics Analyzer (TPDA). Case studies included in the paper demonstrate the accuracy of TPDA {{and its ability to}} simulate electromechanical transients in hybrid models. TPDA has the potential for providing electric utilities and power system planners with more accurate assessment of system stability than traditional dynamic simulation software that assume balanced network topology.

40|$|A model-based new {{procedure}} {{for measuring the}} single electrode-gel-skin impedance (ZEGS) is presented. The method is suitable for monitoring the contact impedance of the electrodes of a large array with limited modifications of the hardware and without removing or disconnecting the array from the amplifier. The procedure is based on multiple measurements between electrode pairs and is particularly suitable for electrode arrays. It {{has been applied to}} study the effectiveness of three skin treatments, with respect to no treatment, for reducing the electrode-gel-skin impedance (ZEGS) and noise: (i) rubbing with alcohol; (ii) rubbing with abrasive conductive paste; (iii) stripping with adhesive tape. The complex impedances ZEGS of the individual electrodes were measured by applying this procedure to disposable commercial Ag-AgCl gelled electrode arrays (4 × 1) with a 5 mm 2 contact area. The <b>impedance</b> <b>unbalance</b> ΔZ = ZEGS 1 − ZEGS 2 and the RMS noise (VRMS) were measured between pairs of electrodes. The tissue impedance ZT was also obtained, as a collateral result. Measurements were repeated at t 0 = 0 min and at t 30 = 30 min from the electrode application. Mixed linear models and linear regression analysis applied to ZEGS, ΔZ and noise VRMS for the skin treatment factor demonstrated (a) that skin rubbing with abrasive conductive paste is more effective in lowering ZEGS, ΔZ and VRMS (p < 0. 01) than the other treatments or no treatment, and (b) a statistically significant decrement (p < 0. 01), between t 0 and t 30, of magnitude and phase of ZEGS. Rubbing with abrasive conductive paste significantly decreased the noise VRMS with respect to other treatments or no treatmen...|$|E
40|$|Telecommunication {{systems are}} {{developing}} rapidly in recent decades. Many important wireless standards {{have been developed}} and commercialized in this period. Quickly expanding multimedia communication technologies driven by the consumers' expectation require higher integration levels. For example, Bluetooth, WLAN, UWB, WPAN and GSM are being integrated into multi-band communication systems {{in order to satisfy}} people's continually increasing demands for the high speed portable communication and multimedia experiences. The increase of bandwidth in communication systems requires not only high performance Radio-Frequency blocks, but also very high speed D/A converters. On the other hand, high bandwidth D/A converters yield transceivers with fewer building blocks. This work focuses on the design of high speed current-steering D/A converters for telecommunication systems. The dynamic performance of D/A converters is always considered as the limiting factor for high speed applications. Several aspects can influence the DAC dynamic performance: the timing errors (non-synchronization, jitter, skew, delay, etc.), digital signal feed-though to the analog output, voltage variation at the output of the current sources, voltage variation at the source of the switch transistors and the output impedance limitation. Among them, the output <b>impedance</b> <b>unbalance</b> problem is still the bottleneck. This work analyzes the influences of the output impedance limitation in different structures and suggests the best solution. Three basis architectures can be used in current steering DACs: binary, unary and segmentation implementations. Designers normally consider the segmentation architecture as the best choice for high performance D/A converters. But in some applications, the binary implementation is more suitable. This work also discusses how to choose a suitable architecture between the binary and the segmentation implementations based on application requirements. Moreover, a different method has been provided to determine the segmentation level when a segmentation structure is needed. Furthermore, this work discusses three different DAC design examples for different applications: 1. A 6 -bit full Nyquist 3 GS/s DAC. 2. A 5 -bit ultra-low power 2 GS/s DAC for UWB transceivers. 3. An 8 -bit capacitance compensation DAC. status: publishe...|$|E
