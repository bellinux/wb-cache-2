25|$|Bailey began {{touring the}} country with comedians such as Mark Lamarr. In 1984 he formed a double act, the Rubber Bishops, with Toby Longworth (a fellow former pupil at King Edward's, Bath). It was there that Bailey began {{developing}} his own style, mixing in musical parodies with deconstructions of or variations on traditional jokes ("How many amoebas <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> change a lightbulb? One, no two! No four! No eight..."). According to comedy folklore, after a reviewer once criticised his act for its lack of jokes, Bailey returned the following night, at Queen Margaret College, Edinburgh, to perform a set composed entirely of punchlines. Longworth left to join the RSC in 1989 {{and was replaced by}} Martin Stubbs.|$|E

2500|$|To {{measure the}} {{difficulty}} of solving a computational problem, one may wish {{to see how much}} time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem. However, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance. In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve. Thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated {{as a function of the}} size of the instance. This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits. Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size. For instance, in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected, how much more time <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> solve a problem for a graph with 2n vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with n vertices? ...|$|E

The work is a response and ode to one of America’s foremost groundbreaking performance artists, Martha Wilson, and offers reflections and humorous observations on the way we see. Inspired by Martha Wilson’s 2005 video titled A History of Performance Art According to Me, Dobkin takes {{on the history of}} performance art by defining its terms and conditions and acknowledging the slippery temperament of her task. The performance was co-presented by TD; The Graduate Program in Theatre and Performance Studies at York University and the Performance Studies (Canada) Speaker Series; Onsite [...] OCAD University; U of T Centre for Drama, Music and Performance Studies; The Mark S.

6000|$|Early {{the next}} morning I walked into a fish-house near our hotel, where three or four men were engaged in trundling out the pickled fish on barrows, and {{spreading}} them to dry. They told me that a vessel had lately {{come in from the}} Banks with forty-four thousand codfish. Timothy Dwight says that, just before he arrived at Provincetown, [...] "a schooner come in from the Great Bank with fifty-six thousand fish, almost one thousand five hundred quintals, taken in a single voyage; the main deck being, on her return, eight inches under water in calm weather." [...] The cod in this fish-house, just out of the pickle, lay packed several feet deep, and three or four men stood on them in cowhide boots, pitching them on to the barrows with an instrument which had a single iron point. One young man, who chewed tobacco, spat on the fish repeatedly. Well, sir, thought I, when that older man sees you he will speak to you. But presently I saw the older man do the same thing. It reminded me of the figs of Smyrna. [...] "How long <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> cure these fish? I asked.|$|E

[...] "And he knows all this by night as well as by day?" [...] "Of course. Why shouldn't he?" [...] "No reason in the world. Only it's pitchy black just now, and I'd like to see where this alley is going to end." [...] "Round the corner beyond that dead wall. There's a lamp there. Then you'll be able to see." [...] A shadow flits out of a gulley and disappears. [...] "Who's that?" [...] "Sergeant of Police just to see where we're going in case of accidents." [...] Another shadow staggers into the darkness. [...] "Who's that?" [...] "Soldier from the Fort or a sailor from the ships. I couldn't quite see." [...] The Police open a shut door in a high wall, and stumble unceremoniously among a gang of women cooking their food. The floor is of beaten earth, the steps that lead into the upper stories are unspeakably grimy, and the heat is the heat of April. The women rise hastily, and the light of the bull's eye--for the Police have now lighted a lantern in regular London fashion--shows six bleared faces--one a half-native half-Chinese one, and the others Bengali. [...] "There are no men here!" [...] they cry. [...] "The house is empty." [...] Then they grin and jabber and chew pan and spit, and hurry up the steps into the darkness. A range of three big rooms has been knocked into one here, and there is some sort of arrangement of mats. But an average country-bred is more sumptuously accommodated in an Englishman's stable.

6000|$|Now, I {{will give}} you a sort of general {{synopsis}} of my idea--of course, everything is subject to your own revision and change. The article, we will say, is written by a TYPICAL train hoister--one without your education and powers of expression (bouquet) but intelligent enough to convey his ideas from HIS STANDPOINT--not from John Wanamaker's. Yet, in order to please John, we will have to assume a virtue that we do not possess. Comment on the moral side of the proposition as little as possible. Do not claim that holding up trains is the only business a gentleman would engage in, and, on the contrary, do not depreciate a profession that is really only financiering with spurs on. Describe the FACTS and DETAILS--all that part of the proceedings that the passenger sitting with his hands up in a Pullman looking into the end of a tunnel in the hands of one of the performers does not see. Here is a rough draft of my idea: Begin abruptly, without any philosophizing, with your idea of the best times, places and conditions for the hold-up--compare your opinions of this with those of others--mention some poorly conceived attempts and failures of others, giving your opinion why--as far as possible refer to actual occurrences, and incidents--describe the manner of a hold-up, how many men is best, where they are stationed, how do they generally go into it, nervous? or joking? or solemnly. The details of stopping the train, the duties of each man of the gang--the behavior of the train crew and passengers (here give as many brief odd and humorous incidents as you can think of). Your opinions on going through the passengers, when is it done and when not done. How is the boodle gotten at? How does the express clerk generally take it? Anything done with the mail car? UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WILL A TRAIN ROBBER SHOOT A PASSENGER OR A TRAIN MAN--suppose a man refuses to throw up his hands? Queer articles found on passengers (a chance here for some imaginative work)--queer and laughable incidents of any kind. Refer whenever apropos to actual hold-ups and facts concerning them of interest. What could two or three brave and determined passengers do if they were to try? Why don't they try? How long <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> do the business. Does the train man ever stand in with the hold-up? Best means of getting away--how and when is the money divided. How is it mostly spent. Best way to manoeuvre afterward. How to get caught and how not to. Comment on the methods of officials who try to capture. (Here's your chance to get even.) ...|$|E
