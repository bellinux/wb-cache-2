5|$|Because Uranus orbits the Sun {{almost on}} its side, and its moons orbit in the planet's {{equatorial}} plane, they (including Oberon) {{are subject to}} an extreme seasonal cycle. Both northern and southern poles spend 42 years <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> darkness, and another 42 years in continuous sunlight, with the sun rising close to the zenith {{over one of the}} poles at each solstice. The Voyager 2 flyby coincided with the southern hemisphere's 1986 summer solstice, when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was in darkness. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus's moons become possible. One such event, which lasted for about six minutes, was observed on May 4, 2007, when Oberon occulted Umbriel.|$|E
