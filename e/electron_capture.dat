40|$|We {{propose a}} new heating {{mechanism}} in magnetar crusts. Magnetars' crustal magnetic fields are {{much stronger than}} their surface fields; therefore, magnetic pressure partially supports the crust against gravity. The crust loses magnetic pressure support as the field decays and must compensate by increasing the electron degeneracy pressure; the accompanying increase in the electron Fermi energy induces nonequilibrium, exothermic <b>electron</b> <b>captures.</b> The total heat released via field-decay <b>electron</b> <b>captures</b> {{is comparable to the}} total magnetic energy in the crust. Thus, field-decay <b>electron</b> <b>captures</b> are an important, if not the primary, mechanism powering magnetars' soft X-ray emission.

40|$|The {{collapse}} of the inner core of a massive star, towards a type II supernova explosion, starts with <b>electron</b> <b>captures</b> on nuclei. This has three important consequences: (i) it reduces the electron degeneracy pressure, accelerating the collapse; (ii) it drives the matter to more neutron-rich nuclei; and (iii) consequently, it produces large amounts of neutrinos, which can cool the star. The subsequent collapse evolution is strongly influenced by the deleptonization due to <b>electron</b> <b>captures</b> on successively more neutron-rich nuclei and free protons [1]. Further deleptonization is blocked after neutrinos become trapped at core densities around ρ ≈ 6 × 10 11 gcm − 3. The value of the lepton fraction {{at the point of}} neutrino thermalization is crucial for determining the size of the homologous core and, consequently, the location of the onset of the shock-wave. Current collapse simulations show a self-regulation mechanism that establishes similar electron fractions for all progenitor models, whenever <b>electron</b> <b>captures</b> on free protons dominate [2, 3]. These simulations assume that <b>electron</b> <b>captures</b> on nuclei stop for nuclei with neutron numbers above the pf-shell closure N = 40. Since Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions can only excite nucleons inside a major shell, it implies that they are Pauli blocked for nuclei with N> 40 and Z < 40...|$|R

5|$|Newly formed astatine-211 is {{the subject}} of ongoing {{research}} in nuclear medicine. It must be used quickly as it decays with a half-life of 7.2hours; this is long enough to permit multistep labeling strategies. Astatine-211 has potential for targeted alpha particle radiotherapy, since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle (to bismuth-207), or via <b>electron</b> <b>capture</b> (to an extremely short-lived nuclide, polonium-211, which undergoes further alpha decay). Polonium X-rays emitted {{as a result of the}} <b>electron</b> <b>capture</b> branch, in the range of 77–92keV, enable the tracking of astatine in animals and patients.

5|$|Beta decay (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino, while proton to neutron transition (except in <b>electron</b> <b>capture)</b> causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. <b>Electron</b> <b>capture</b> is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.|$|E

40|$|<b>Electron</b> <b>captures</b> and neutron {{emissions}} by atomic nuclei in dense matter {{are among the}} most important processes governing the late evolution of stars. Not only do these processes limit the stability of massive white dwarfs, but also lead to the neutronization of matter in the interior of neutron stars. Although these processes have been known for a long time, most studies have focused on nonmagnetized matter. On the other hand, some white dwarfs and neutron stars are endowed with very strong magnetic fields, of the order of 10 ^ 9 G and 10 ^ 15 G respectively. As a matter of fact, much stronger fields may potentially exist in their interiors.

The latter has a half-life of 1.5×1017 years and a natural abundance of 0.25%. 51V has a nuclear spin of , which is useful for NMR spectroscopy. Twenty-four artificial radioisotopes have been characterized, ranging in mass number from 40 to 65.

40|$|The {{onset of}} <b>electron</b> <b>captures</b> by nuclei in dense matter, {{which is known}} to limit the {{stability}} of the most massive white dwarfs, is studied considering that electrons are interacting with an ionic mixture and allowing for the presence of a strong magnetic field. To this end, the instability condition traditionally formulated {{in the context of the}} simple Chandrasekhar model is generalized. General analytical expressions for the threshold mass density and pressure are obtained in the ultrarelativistic regime in the absence of magnetic fields, and in the limiting case of strongly quantizing magnetic fields. Numerical results are also presented for different stellar compositions and magnetic field strengths. The threshold density and pressures are found to be increased due to electron-ion interactions, and the heavier the elements the larger this shift: from less than $ 13 %$ for elements lighter than magnesium, up to $ 23 %$ for iron. The resulting increase of the maximum white dwarf mass turns out to be more important than that due to general relativity for stars made of heavy elements like sulfur, calcium and iron. Nevertheless, the overall effect amounts to about $ 2 %$ at most. <b>Electron</b> <b>captures</b> accompanying pycnonuclear fusion reactions may have a more substantial impact. Moreover, the onset of <b>electron</b> <b>captures</b> is found to be shifted to either higher or lower densities in the presence of a strong magnetic field. In the strongly quantizing regime, the threshold density and pressure increase almost linearly with the magnetic field strength. The implications for magnetic white dwarfs are briefly discussed.
