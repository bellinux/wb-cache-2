40|$|Application of {{membrane}} filtration to sugarcane juice refining is appealing {{because it can}} eliminate the usage of chemicals, achieve continuous and automated production, as well as produce superior quality of juice. However, some technical problems, such as low permeate flux, high sucrose loss in membrane retentate and serious membrane fouling, are impeding this technological upgrading in sugar industry. In this work, an <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>process</b> consisting of a tubular loose ultrafiltration (UF), a spiral wound tight UF and a spiral-wound NF was developed to refine the raw sugarcane juice at pilot-plant scale. With a super high volume reduction ratio (VRR) of 20, the loose UF {{was able to be}} operated at a flux from 30 to 70 L m(- 2) h(- 1), and the tight UF could run at a flux from 10 to 40 L m- 2 h- 1; at the same time, the color removal kept more than 95 %. Moreover, diafiltration operation could recover most of sugar in the UF concentrates, leading to a high sucrose recovery of up to 98 % in two-stage UF. A novel cascade diafiltration mode was proposed to save water by 25 % compared with the separated diafiltration. Mathematical models could well predict the diafiltration efficiency for the loose UF but not for the tight UF. Permeate flux of the loose UF was dominated by membrane fouling while for the tight UF, osmotic pressure played a more important role in the flux decline. With a suitable cleaning strategy, the performance of this <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>process</b> can be nearly regenerated although the temperature jump between filtration and cleaning (60 - 30 degrees C) might result in some foulants accumulating in the membrane system. These results would serve as a valuable guide for process design and practical operation in subsequent industrial application. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

In this work, an <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>process</b> for the recovery of flavonoids from orange press liquors was investigated on a laboratory scale. The liquor was previously clarified by ultrafiltration (UF) in selected operating conditions by using hollow fiber polysulfone membranes. Then, the clarified liquor with a total soluble solids (TSS) content of 10 g· 100 g− 1 was pre-concentrated by nanofiltration (NF) up to 32 g TSS 100 g− 1 by using a polyethersulfone spiral-wound membrane. A final concentration step, up to 47 g TSS 100 g− 1, was performed by using an osmotic distillation (OD) apparatus equipped with polypropylene hollow fiber membranes. Suspended solids were completely removed in the UF step producing a clarified liquor containing most part of the flavonoids of the original press liquor due to the low rejection of the UF membrane towards these compounds. Flavanones and anthocyanins were highly rejected by the NF membrane, producing a permeate stream with a TSS content of 4. 5 g· 100 g− 1. An increasing of both the flavanones and anthocyanins concentration was observed in the NF retentate by increasing the volume reduction factor (VRF).

To avoid membrane scaling and obtain a high water recovery, an <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>process</b> is proposed in this investigation: ion fractionation and metathesis by a nanofiltration (NF) - electrodialysis (ED) integrated system (namely "Fracsis"). In the first step, this system makes use of the advantage of NF which can fractionate the bivalent ions from the monovalent ions. Results show that the tested NF membrane has a satisfying selectivity for this application, with a retention of Na+ 38 - 49 %, Cl- 20 - 38 %, and Ca 2 + > 98 %, SO 42 - > 85 %. Afterwards, both NF permeate (monovalent stream) and retentate (divalent stream) {{were sent to the}} ED for metathesis. By ED metathesis, salts with high solubility (CaCl 2 and Na 2 SO 4) were synthesized in two separate streams and hence a high water recovery was achieved. The water recovery rate may reach 98. 5 % in case a continuous mode is used. Finally, the operational cost was calculated on this bench scale Fracsis system. Results indicate that although the energy consumption is higher than that of a RO system, Fracsis has its advantages in a higher water recovery, lower cost on chemical consumption and sludge treatment expenditures. To a broader context, this technology may possibly be used for chemical purification and synthesis in various industries in case mixed inorganic/organic salt streams are concerned...|$|E

However, the production of brine, which is known to be a concentrated solution, {{is an integral part of}} the operation of the desalination plant, which faces critical environmental challenges because of its high salinity. Therefore, a cost-effective and environmentally benign brine management system is required prior to its proper disposal. Currently, several disposal options including surface water discharge, deep well injection, and evaporation ponds have been used. However, these processes are unsustainable and their use is limited by a high capital cost and limited applications. Various conventional treatments including physicochemical, oxidation and biological processes with varying extents of organics removal have been reported. Nowadays, membrane-based technologies appear to be cost-effective methods for managing brine concentrate as they can recover valuable resources and produce clean water with high recovery.

This full-scale plant (capacity 70 million m 3 yr- 1) {{can be characterized as}} an integrated treatment process. Experience since 1995 has revealed that biological activated carbon filtration has several benefits in integrated treatment processes. It is a very effective barrier for organics in general and for pesticides and organic micropollutants in particular. Due to the preceding ozonation both adsorption and biodegradation take place, resulting in a very long lifetime of the carbon filters (2 years). The ozonation significantly increases the disinfection capacity of the plant. Together with the other process steps, the disinfection capacity is at such a high level that, in combination with the biological stability of the finished water and good engineering practice in the distribution system, no chlorination has to be applied to guarantee hygienic quality. The process stability of the final treatment step, slow sand filtration, is, importantly, increased by the introduction of ozone-activated carbon filtration. Running times of the slow sand filters are longer than 2 - 3 years, while before the introduction of ozone-activated carbon filtration they never exceeded 1 year. In <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>processes</b> [...] which may be used in the treatment plant Leiduin in the future and therefore are being tested on pilot plant scale [...] ozone-activated carbon filtration also offers many advantages. In a reverse osmosis pretreatment scheme, comprising ozone-activated carbon filtration and slow sand filtration, the reverse osmosis system was shown to have a running time of I year without any membrane cleaning, due to the excellent reverse osmosis feed water quality.

40|$|Abstract The food {{industry}} {{is by far}} the largest potable water consuming industry that releases about 500 million m 3 of wastewater per annum with very high organic loading. Simple treatment of this stream using conventional technologies often fails due to cost factors overriding their pollution abating capacity. Hence, recently the focus has been largely centered on valorization through combinatorial recovery of valuable components and reclaiming good quality water using <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>process.</b> Membrane processes practically cover all existing and needed unit operations that are used in wastewater treatment facilities. They often come with advantages like simplicity, modularity, process or product novelty, improved competitiveness, and environmental friendliness. Thus, the main focus of this PhD thesis is development of <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>process</b> comprising microfiltration (MF), forward osmosis (FO), ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF) for valorization of food based wastewater within the logic of zero liquid discharge. As a case study, vegetation wastewater coming from olive oil production was taken. Challenges associated with the treatment of vegetation wastewater are: absence of unique hydraulic or organic loadings, presence of biophenolic compounds, sever membrane fouling and periodic release of large volume of wastewater. Especially presence of biophenolic compounds makes the wastewater detrimental to the environment. However, recovering these phytotoxic compounds can also add economic benefit to the simple treatment since they have interesting bioactivities that can be exploited in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. The first part of the experimental work gives special emphasis on the development of biohybrid membranes used to control membrane fouling during MF. Regardless of 99 % TSS removal with rough filtration, continuous MF of vegetation wastewater using 0. 4 µm polyethelene membrane over 24 h resulted in continuous flux decline. This is due to sever membrane fouling mainly caused by macromolecules like pectins. To overcome the problem of membrane fouling, biocatalytic membrane reactors with covalently immobilized pectinase were used to develop self-cleaning MF membrane. The biocatalytic membrane with pectinase on its surface gave a 50 % higher flux compared to its counterpart inert membrane. This better performance was attributed to simultaneous in-situ degradation of foulants and removal of hydrolysis products from reaction site that overcome enzyme product inhibition. Although the biocatalytic membrane gave a better performance, its fate is disposal once the covalently immobilized enzyme gets deactivated or oversaturated with foulants. To surmount this problem a new class of superparamagnetic biochemical membrane reactor was developed, verified and optimized. This development is novel for its use of superparamagnetic nanoparticles both as support for the immobilized enzyme and as agent to render the membrane magnetized. This reversible immobilization method was designed to facilitate the removal of enzyme during membrane cleaning using an external magnet. Hence PVDF based organic-inorganic (O/I) hybrid membrane was prepared using superparamagnetic nanoparticles (NPSP) as inorganic filler. In parallel, superparamagnetic biocatalytic nanocomposites were prepared by covalently immobilizing pectinase on to the surface of NPSP dispersed in aqueous media. The synergetic magnetic responsiveness of both the O/I hybrid membrane and the biocatalytic particle to an external magnetic field was later on used to physically immobilize the biocatalytic particles on the membrane. This magnetically controlled dynamic layer of biocatalytic particles prevented direct membrane-foulant interaction, allowed in-situ degradation, easy magnetic recovery of the enzyme {{from the surface of the}} membrane, use of both membrane and immobilized enzyme over multiple cycles and possibility of fresh enzyme make up. The system gave stable performance over broad range of experimental condition: 0. 01 - 3 mg/mL foulant concentration, 1 - 9 g per m 2 of membrane area bionanocomposites, 5 - 45 L/m 2. h flux and different filtration temperatures. Under condition of mass transfer rate prevailing reaction rate, the system gave upto 75 % reduction in filtration resistance. After optimization of the different operational parameters, it also revealed no visible loss in enzyme activity or overall system performance, when 0. 3 mg/mL pectin solution was continuously filtered for over two weeks. In addition, the chemical cleaning stability of the O/I hybrid membrane was studied under accelerated ageing and accelerated fouling conditions. The ageing caused change in the physico-chemical characteristics and enhanced fouling propensity of the membrane due to step-by-step degradation of the polymeric coating layer of used NPSP. But 400 ppm NaOCl solution at pH 12 was found compatible; henceforth it was used to clean the membrane. Second major limitation identified during the treatment of vegetation wastewater is presence of large volume of wastewater that comes in short period following the harvest of olive fruit. To alleviate this problem, FO was investigated to concentrate the wastewater. This process is believed to be less energy demanding, suppose that draw solution does need to be regenerated, and with low foul propensity. By operating at 3. 7 molal MgCl 2 draw solution and 6 cm/s crossflow velocity, single-step FO resulted in an average flux of 5. 2 kg/m 2. h. and 71 % volume concentration factor with almost complete retention of all the pollutants. Moreover, the system gave a stable performance over ten days when operated continuously. After FO, both NF and UF were used to fractionate the recovered biophenols from the concentrate streams of FO. Compared to polymeric UF membrane, ceramic NF gave better flux of 27 kg/m 2. h at 200 L/h feed flow rate and 7 bar TMP. Finally, when FO was used as a final polishing step to recover highly concentrated biophenols from permeate of the UF; it gave an average flux of 5 kg/m 2. h and VCF of 64 %. In conclusion, a great success has been made in tackling the two most important challenges of vegetation wastewater valorisation using the concept of biohybridization and FO. The bio-inspired NPSP provides strong evidence that magnetically controlled enzyme immobilization have an immense potential in membrane fouling prevention and paves a potential breakthrough for continuous wastewater filtration. By setting bio-inspired NPSP biocatalytic membrane reactor at the heart, it is possible to successfully use <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>process</b> for continuous valorisation of food based wastewater. In addition to fouling prevention, they open a new horizon for applications in localized biocatalysis to intensify performance in industrial production, processing, environmental remediation or bio-energy generation.

This development is novel for its use of superparamagnetic nanoparticles both as support for the immobilized enzyme and as agent to render the membrane magnetized. This reversible immobilization method was designed to facilitate the removal of enzyme during membrane cleaning using an external magnet. Hence PVDF based organic-inorganic (O/I) hybrid membrane was prepared using superparamagnetic nanoparticles (NPSP) as inorganic filler. In parallel, superparamagnetic biocatalytic nanocomposites were prepared by covalently immobilizing pectinase on to the surface of NPSP dispersed in aqueous media. The synergetic magnetic responsiveness of both the O/I hybrid membrane and the biocatalytic particle to an external magnetic field was later on used to physically immobilize the biocatalytic particles on the membrane. This magnetically controlled dynamic layer of biocatalytic particles prevented direct membrane-foulant interaction, allowed in-situ degradation, easy magnetic recovery of the enzyme {{from the surface of the}} membrane, use of both membrane and immobilized enzyme over multiple cycles and possibility of fresh enzyme make up. The system gave stable performance over broad range of experimental condition: 0. 01 - 3 mg/mL foulant concentration, 1 - 9 g per m 2 of membrane area bionanocomposites, 5 - 45 L/m 2. h flux and different filtration temperatures. Under condition of mass transfer rate prevailing reaction rate, the system gave upto 75 % reduction in filtration resistance. After optimization of the different operational parameters, it also revealed no visible loss in enzyme activity or overall system performance, when 0. 3 mg/mL pectin solution was continuously filtered for over two weeks. In addition, the chemical cleaning stability of the O/I hybrid membrane was studied under accelerated ageing and accelerated fouling conditions. The ageing caused change in the physicochemical characteristics and enhanced fouling propensity of the membrane due to step-by-step degradation of the polymeric coating layer of used NPSP. But 400 ppm NaOCl solution at pH 12 was found compatible; henceforth it was used to clean the membrane. Second major limitation identified during the treatment of vegetation wastewater is presence of large volume of wastewater that comes in short period following the harvest of olive fruit. To alleviate this problem, FO was investigated to concentrate the wastewater. This process is believed to be less energy demanding, suppose that draw solution does need to be regenerated, and with low foul propensity. By operating at 3. 7 molal MgCl 2 draw solution and 6 cm/s crossflow velocity, single-step FO resulted in an average flux of 5. 2 kg/m 2. h. and 71 % volume concentration factor with almost complete retention of all the pollutants. Moreover, the system gave a stable performance over ten days when operated continuously. After FO, both NF and UF were used to fractionate the recovered biophenols from the concentrate streams of FO. Compared to polymeric UF membrane, ceramic NF gave better flux of 27 kg/m 2. h at 200 L/h feed flow rate and 7 bar TMP. Finally, when FO was used as a final polishing step to recover highly concentrated biophenols from permeate of the UF; it gave an average flux of 5 kg/m 2. h and VCF of 64 %. In conclusion, a great success has been made in tackling the two most important challenges of vegetation wastewater valorisation using the concept of biohybridization and FO. The bioinspired NPSP provides strong evidence that magnetically controlled enzyme immobilization have an immense potential in membrane fouling prevention and paves a potential breakthrough for continuous wastewater filtration. By setting bio-inspired NPSP biocatalytic membrane reactor at the heart, it is possible to successfully use <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>process</b> for continuous valorisation of food based wastewater. In addition to fouling prevention, they open a new horizon for applications in localized biocatalysis to intensify performance in industrial production, processing, environmental remediation or bio-energy generation.

40|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} are widely recognized as {{an important source of}} beneficial compounds for the human nutrition. Citrus and juices are widely consumed in the world. Their health benefits have been recognized {{for a long time now}} since first cultivated in Asia. The market of oranges is growing constantly, because consumers have become more convenience-oriented and health conscious. Consequently, efforts by researchers and industrial organizations have been made to develop processes more efficient, putting emphasis in food quality and safety. In addition, with the increasing emphasis on water pollution control, industries are establishing programs that will permit disposal of their wastewater without damaging the environment. The citrus fruit industry is no exception. Citrus wastes, such as wet peels and whole rejected fruit, which a great amount of organic matter that can be associated with environmental and health problems due to water runoff and uncontrolled fermentation. Therefore, the development of optimized systems for the treatment of citrus wastes is a crucial factor in the rationalization of the traditional industrial cycle. Membrane operations in the last years have shown their potentialities in the rationalization of production systems. Their intrinsic characteristics of efficiency, operational simplicity and flexibility, relatively high selectivity and permeability for the transport of specific components, low energy requirements, good stability under a wide spectrum of operating conditions, environment compatibility, easy control and scale-up have been confirmed in a large variety of applications and operations in the food industry. Recent R&D efforts aim to convert the potential of wastes into profitable products creating new segments of production and offsetting the disposal costs. Orange peels and pulp contain several bioactive compounds, such as flavonoids and phenolic acids, recognized for their beneficial implications in human health due to their antioxidant activity and free radical scavenging ability. These semi-solid wastes can be pressed to obtain a liquid rich in soluble sugars, named press liquor, that can be concentrated up to citrus molasses grade or alternatively exploited as a natural source for the extraction of phenolic compounds which can be used as natural antioxidants mainly in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and foods industry. This PhD dissertation is based on the opportunity to develop a technical alternative to solve some problems related to the disposal of citrus wastes from an economic and environmental point of view, specifically in terms of recovery of attractive compounds present in orange press liquor. The general aim of the work was devoted to the recovery of phenolic compounds by using an <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>process,</b> in which microfiltration (MF) or ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) and osmotic distillation (OD) processes were involved. MF or UF processes were used for the clarification of the press liquor in order to separate macromolecules, such as pectins, and to obtain a clarified press liquor as permeate stream. In the second step the clarified press liquor obtained from the MF/UF process was treated by NF in order to obtain a retentate stream enriched in phenolic compounds with a low content of sugars. Finally, OD was used as final step to concentrate the NF retentate stream. In the first Chapter, a general overview of membrane operations, including methodologies to evaluate their performance, is reported. The industrial transformation of citrus fruits and the associated production of citrus wastes is reported in Chapter 2. In this Chapter the chemico-physical characterization of citrus press liquor used for the experimental activities performed on membrane laboratory plants is also included. Chapter 3 is focused on the experimental activities concerning the clarification of citrus press liquor by using MF or UF processes. In Chapter 4 the fractionation of clarified press liquor by using NF membranes is analysed and discussed.

40|$|Hydrogen {{production}} from various hydrocarbon fuels, particularly biomass-derived fuels, has attracted worldwide attention {{due to its}} potential for application to fuel cells, a device which converts chemical energy into electricity efficiently and cleanly. However, current technology, such as natural gas steam reforming, could not meet the specific requirements of hydrogen for fuel cells. Therefore, novel processes are intensively investigated, aiming to develop economic and efficient ones for the specific purpose. An important direction is the <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> reformer for one-step high-purity hydrogen production. However, for the commercial realization of this technology, {{there are still some}} difficulties to overcome. By comparison with previous investigations with a similar membrane, this work showed that catalyst also {{played an important role in}} determining membrane reformer performance. We proposed that when thickness of membrane was several micrometers, the permeance of membrane became less important than the kinetics of catalyst, due to the fact that under Such conditions, hydrogen permeation rate was faster than the kinetics of steam reforming reaction when commercial catalyst was applied, but further evidence is indispensable. In this initial work, we focused on developing efficient nickel catalyst for low temperature steam reforming. Nickel-based catalyst was developed by deposition-coprecipitation and used as pre-reduced, showing high performance for methane steam reforming at low temperatures and good durability, which may find practical application for the <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> reforming <b>process.</b> (C) 2009 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Water {{consumption}} and wastewater generation depletes water resources {{and has a}} destructive impact on the environment. Recent attention has aimed at preserving water resources and preventing pollution through several routes. Restrictions on wastewater discharge into the environment, recycling, reuse and regeneration of wastewater streams are now common practices toward achieving these objectives. <b>Membrane</b> and <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>processes</b> {{have been shown to}} be effective at reducing water usage and recovering valuable compounds. This thesis focuses on topics related to the optimal synthesis of wastewater treatment networks by hybrid membrane systems. The use of superstructures has been a useful tool to synthesize chemical engineering process flowsheets. The approach postulates all possible alternatives of a potential treatment network. Within the representation, an optimal solution is assumed to be hidden in the given superstructure. State space is a framework to process synthesis problems which involves heat and mass exchange. In this representation, unit operations, utility units and utility streams can be embedded in such a way that all the process synthesis alternatives can be realized. Such a framework can be applied for water and wastewater synthesis problems. Several research optimization studies presented membrane and hybrid <b>membrane</b> <b>process</b> synthesis problems for wastewater treatment. Nonetheless, the problems in fact can be represented in several ways. Therefore, the mathematical programs are expected to be different for every postulated representation. Comparison between different representations and their mathematical programs are analyzed to highlight the relationship between the superstructure representation and their mathematical programming formulations. Possible improvement of these superstructures is addressed. Also, a generic representation is provided to give a systematic and clear description for assembling hybrid membrane system superstructures via the state space approach. The synthesis of reverse osmosis networks (RON) for water and wastewater treatment network is presented as a superstructure problem. The mathematical programming model describes the RON through a nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP). A mixed integer linear program (MILP) is derived based on the convex relaxation of the nonconvex terms in the MINLP to bound the global optimum. The MILP models are solved iteratively to supply different initial guesses for the nonconvex MINLP model. It is found that such a procedure is effective in finding local optimum solutions in reasonable time. Water desalination and treatment of aqueous wastes from the pulp and paper industry are considered as case studies to illustrate the solution strategy. The RON mathematical program is a nonconvex MINLP which contains several local optima. A deterministic branch and bound (B&B) algorithm to determine the global optimum for the RON synthesis problem has also been developed. A piecewise MILP is derived based on the convex relaxation of the nonconvex terms present in the MINLP formulation to approximate the original nonconvex program and to obtain a valid lower bound on the global optimum. The MILP model is solved at every node in the branch and bound tree to verify the global optimality of the treatment network within a pre-specified gap tolerance. Several constraints are developed to simultaneously screen the treatment network alternatives during the search, tighten the variable bounds and consequently accelerate algorithm convergence. Water desalination is considered as a case study to illustrate this approach for global optimization of the RO network. Wastewater and groundwater streams contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) require proper treatment to comply with discharge standards or drinking requirement restrictions. Air stripping and pervaporation are two common treatment technologies for water streams contaminated with VOCs. The combination of these technologies for water treatment which are representative of hybrid membrane systems may offer advantages over stand-alone treatments. Superstructure optimization uses the framework of hybridization to determine the optimal treatment network and the optimal operational requirements for the treatment units to achieve desired water qualities. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the proposed approach and sensitivity of the optimal solutions to given perturbations is analyzed...|$|R

The process is based on a combination of membrane distillation (MD) and osmotic distillation (OD) steps with integrated crystallization. In the first MD step seawater is concentrated up to the saturation point of CaCO 3. In subsequent MD or OD steps, pure water and salts (a. o. CaCO 3, NaCl, KCl) are separated until complete dewatering and crystallization. The equipment and energy costs for this process are approximately € 1. 09 /m 3. Laboratory research with single salt solutions showed that after three days of MD operation with a saturated CaCO 3 solution (77 °C) a complete flux decline occurred. This could be prevented by adding CaCO 3 crystals to the system to promote crystallization in the bulk liquid. The treatment of a saturated NaCl solution (80 °C) with MD resulted in a complete flux decline within 1 h. In an OD system NaCl crystallization (64 °C) was more successful when NaCl seeds were added to the system and a draw solution was used at the condensate side.

40|$|The {{application}} {{domain of}} membrane processes is rapidly expanding. However, many membrane processes are still characterized by low selectivities. The {{goal of this}} thesis was to increase the separation performance of pressure driven membrane processes for small organic molecules (< 1000 g/mol). In a first part, the potential is explored of an <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>process,</b> with MF, UF and NF stages, for the purification of steviol glycosides from the Stevia Rebaudiana plant. For the UF stage, the permeability and selectivity of commercial and lab-made PES membranes were compared for a synthetic mixture. Although commercial membranes had better performances than lab-made membranes for the synthetic mixture, the gap disappeared with the plant extract because the tailor-made membranes were less prone to fouling than commercial ones. With the overall process, a three-fold increase in purity to 37 % and a yield of 30 % could be achieved. In a second part, a better defined, solvent-based pharmaceutical application was considered that consisted {{of the separation of}} a target solute and an impurity having very similar molecular weights (221 and 188 g/mol, respecively). The effect of membrane cascade configuration on process yield, time and cost was investigated thoroughly by modeling based on single-stage experimental data. The different studied configurations were capable of achieving the required 90 % purity starting from a 26 % feed solution. The increase in product yield in the retentate appeared to level-off with the number of stages. As a result, an optimum number of stages, in this case two, could be identified. In a third part, membrane cascades were assessed both technically and economically, for three different sugar separations, namely raffinose/sucrose, glucose/fructose and xylose/glucose. The McCabe-Thiele method, previously used for gas separation with membrane cascades, was adapted for solute/solute separations. An algorithm was developed to design a membrane cascade that can achieve the same performance as a reference simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography installation. A subsequent cost-analysis showed that for two out of the three studied separations, membrane cascades could be more cost-effective than SMB, and the cost-effectiveness increased towards larger plant sizes and less stringent purity requirements. Finally, several biologic ligand classes were explored with emphasis on both simplicity, to enable rapid integration in membrane processes, and interesting selectivities, that could drastically broaden the application area of membrane processes. Due to their simplicity in structure and manufacture, aptamers are believed to be well adapted to break the age-old catch- 22 for industrial application of ligand-based membrane processes. Proteins are distinctly more complex than aptamers, but they clearly outcompete their RNA-based counterparts in organizing selective transmembrane transport. The current knowledge of the transport mechanism of aquaporins was discussed indetail and complemented with new insights as well as {{the state of the art}} of membrane integration techniques were presented. Thereafter, high flux general bacterial porins were discussed, as they could be incorporated into nanofiltration membranes, to increase the rejection of persistant organic pollutants. Sugar-selective porins were treated, as they could be used to manufacture the first chemical free membrane adsorber. Subsequently, lectins were explored as, unlike standard anthropogenic separation processes, they are able to effectively separate different sugar isomers in one bind and elution step. Their exquisite sugar selectivity formed a clear impetus to reiterate the separation it all started with: the purification of the sweetener stevioside. With Con A, which constitutes a standard glucose/mannose-selective lectin, a discrimination factor in dissociation constant of a factor 6 and 23 was obtained in silico relative to glucose and mannose respectively. Finally, a new method was presented from the field of drug design, that can determine the selectivity in silico, independent of other competing ligands or targets. This method could solve a very old problem and another possible impediment to swift industrial application of biomimetic affinity filtration or membrane adsorption, as often competing ligands or targets are not available for measuring the selectivity directly.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs), both from anthropogenic and naturally occurring origins, in the aquatic environment {{is of concern}} from environmental and human health protection perspective. Many of these TrOCs are ubiquitous in domestic wastewater and advanced treatment processes are required to ensure their removal to a safe level if the reclaimed water is intended for indirect potable water recycling applications. This thesis work investigated the removal of TrOCs by three <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>processes</b> for indirect potable water recycling applications. The results reported in this thesis indicate {{that a combination of}} membrane bioreactor (MBR) with nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO) membrane filtration can complement each other very well to efficiently remove a wide range of TrOCs. Forward osmosis (FO) is an emerging treatment technology and results reported here also showed some promising aspects of this process for the removal of TrOCs. The innovative combination of FO in combination with MBR in the form of osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR) for the removal of TrOCs was also investigated in this thesis work. The results are preliminary but demonstrate the potential of this approach as a low energy process for the production of high quality treated effluent, particularly when discharging into the ocean (i. e. seawater is readily available as the draw solution). The removal of TrOCs by a hybrid treatment process incorporating an MBR with NF/RO filtration was investigated. Using a laboratory scale MBR system and a cross-flow NF/RO system, experiments were conducted with 40 organic compounds representing the major groups of TrOCs found in wastewater. The results suggest that the MBR system could effectively remove hydrophobic and biodegradable trace organic compounds, while the remaining trace organic compounds (mostly hydrophilic) were effectively removed by the NF/RO membranes. The combination of MBR and a low pressure RO membrane resulted in more than 95 % removal (or removal to below the limits of analytical detection), for all the compounds investigated in this study. Results reported in this research component also suggest that fouling mitigation of the NF/RO membranes can be adequately controlled. The rejection of TrOCs by an osmotically driven <b>membrane</b> filtration <b>process</b> was also investigated using a set of 40 compounds. Their rejection by an FO membrane specifically designed for the osmotically driven process and a tight NF membrane was systematically investigated and compared under three different operating modes, namely forward osmosis (FO), pressure retarded osmosis (PRO), and reverse osmosis (RO). The results revealed that the FO membrane had a considerably higher water flux than the NF membrane when operated in either the FO or PRO modes. However, the NF membrane consistently rejected the contaminants better than the FO membrane. In the RO mode, electrostatic interactions played a dominant role in governing the rejection of charged compounds, whereas in the FO and PRO modes, their rejection was governed by both electrostatic interaction and size exclusion. On the other hand, the rejection of neutral compounds was dominated by size exclusion, with rejection increasing with the molecular weight of the component. The PRO mode resulted in a higher water flux but a notably lower rejection of TrOCs than with the FO mode. It is also noteworthy that the rejection of neutral compounds in the FO mode was higher than in the RO mode. This behavior could be attributed to the retarded forward diffusion occurring in the FO mode. The removal of TrOCs using an innovative OMBR system was also investigated. Following an initial gradual decline, a stable permeate flux value was obtained after approximately four days of continuous operation, although the biological activity of the OMBR system continued to deteriorate, possibly due to the build-up of salinity in the reactor. The OMBR mostly removed the large molecular weight trace organic compounds by above 80 % and was possibly governed by the interplay between the physical separation of the FO membrane and biodegradation. Whereas, the removal efficiency of smaller trace organic compounds by OMBR was scattered and appeared to depend mostly on biological degradation...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this project {{is to develop a}} <b>membrane</b> <b>process</b> that {{produces}} air containing 25 - 35 % oxygen, at a cost of $ 25 - 40 /ton of equivalent pure oxygen (EPO 2). Oxygen-enriched air at such a low cost will allow existing air-fueled furnaces to be converted economically to oxygen-enriched furnaces, which in turn will improve the economic and energy efficiency of combustion processes significantly, and reduce the cost of CO{sub 2 } capture and sequestration from flue gases throughout the U. S. manufacturing industries. During the 12 -month Concept Definition project: We identified a series of perfluoropolymers (PFPs) with promising oxygen/nitrogen separation properties, which were successfully made into thin film composite membranes. The membranes showed oxygen permeance as high as 1, 200 gpu and oxygen/nitrogen selectivity of 3. 0, and the permeance and selectivity were stable over the time period tested (60 days). We successfully scaled up the production of high-flux PFP-based membranes, using MTR's commercial coaters. Two bench-scale spiral-wound modules with countercurrent designs were made and parametric tests were performed to understand the effect of feed flow rate and pressure, permeate pressure and sweep flow rate on the membrane module separation properties. At various operating conditions that modeled potential industrial operating conditions, the module separation properties were similar to the pure-gas separation properties in the membrane stamps. We also identified and synthesized new polymers [including polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) and polyimides] with higher oxygen/nitrogen selectivity (3. 5 - 5. 0) than the PFPs, and made these polymers into thin film composite membranes. However, these membranes were susceptible to severe aging; pure-gas permeance decreased nearly six-fold within two weeks, making them impractical for industrial applications of oxygen enrichment. We tested the effect of oxygen-enriched air on NO{sub x} emissions using a Bloom baffle burner at GTI. The results are positive and confirm that oxygen-enriched combustion can be carried out without producing higher levels of NOx than normal air firing, if lancing of combustion air is used and the excess air levels are controlled. A simple economic study shows that the <b>membrane</b> <b>processes</b> can produce O{sub 2 } at less than $ 40 /ton EPO{sub 2 } and an energy cost of 1. 1 - 1. 5 MMBtu/ton EPO{sub 2 }, which are very favorable compared with conventional technologies such as cryogenics and vacuum pressure swing adsorption processes. The benefits of <b>integrated</b> <b>membrane</b> processes/combustion <b>process</b> trains have been evaluated, and show good savings in process costs and energy consumption, as well as reduced CO{sub 2 } emissions. For example, if air containing 30 % oxygen is used in natural gas furnaces, the net natural gas savings are an estimated 18 % at a burner temperature of 2, 500 F, and 32 % at a burner temperature of 3, 000 F. With a 20 % market penetration of membrane-based oxygen-enriched combustion in all combustion processes by 2020, the energy savings would be 414 - 736 TBtu/y in the U. S. The comparable net cost savings are estimated at $ 1. 2 - 2. 1 billion per year by 2020, calculated as the value of fuel savings subtracted from the cost of oxygen production. The fuel savings of 18 %- 32 % by the membrane/oxygen-enriched combustion corresponds to an 18 %- 32 % reduction in CO{sub 2 } emissions, or 23 - 40 MM ton/y less CO{sub 2 } from natural gas-fired furnaces by 2020. In summary, results from this project (Concept Definition phase) are highly promising and clearly demonstrate that <b>membrane</b> <b>processes</b> can produce oxygen-enriched air in a low cost manner that will lower operating costs and energy consumption in industrial combustion processes.

40|$|A novel {{batch reactor}} concept is {{proposed}} for the catalytic production of hydrogen in distributed and portable applications. In the proposed CHAMP (CO 2 /H 2 Active Membrane Piston) reactor, a batch of hydrocarbon or synthetic fuel is held in the reaction chamber where it reacts to produce hydrogen with simultaneous removal of the hydrogen by permeation through an <b>integrated,</b> selective <b>membrane.</b> These <b>processes</b> proceed to the desired level of completion {{at which point the}} reaction chamber is exhausted and a fresh batch of fuel mixture brought in. Unique to the CHAMP reactor is the ability to precisely control the residence time, as well as the ability to compress the reaction chamber dynamically, or mid-cycle, in order to increase the instantaneous hydrogen yield rate. An idealized reactor model demonstrates that the ideal limits of performance (in the absence of transport limitations) exceed those of comparable continuous flow designs. A comprehensive, coupled, transport-kinetics model is used to quantify the effects of mass transport limitations on reactor performance and search the design parameter space for optimal points. Two modes of operation are studied: fixed-volume mode wherein the piston is stationary and constant-pressure mode in which the rate of compression matches the permeation of hydrogen through the membrane. Finally, to validate these numerical models and confirm our understanding of the key operating principles, prototype reactors were built and experimentally characterized. Ph. D.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{considerable}} {{attention has been}} given to the need for reduced energy costs in the chemical processing industry. A major portion of the energy consumed in this industry is associated with the separation and recovery of chemicals. <b>Membrane</b> <b>processes</b> offer energy-efficient, cost-effective methods of separating and concentrating liquid mixtures. In comparison to distillation for example, the energy savings associated with the <b>membrane</b> <b>process</b> rests in the fact that no costly phase change is required. This paper introduces various separation processes (reverse osmosis, ultrafitration, and microfiltration) and their current applications. The discussion includes a brief overview of recent developments that should enable the applicability of <b>membrane</b> <b>processes</b> to expand in the near future...|$|R

40|$|Lumen mass {{transfer}} coefficient for hollow membrane separation or reaction processes was studied by solving numerically the continuity mass conservation equation with the corresponding boundary conditions, when external resistance and shell concentration are constant, external resistance is constant while a variable shell concentration resulting from an operational mode of co-current or counter-current, or nonlinear boundary conditions {{occur at the}} lumen surface of the membranes. When Fickian diffusion is valid, the correlations of lumen {{mass transfer}} coefficient for various boundary conditions can be to predict the hollow fiber <b>membrane</b> <b>processes</b> accurately. The cases where Nerst-Planck diffusion is valid are also analyzed. Hollow fiber supported gas or liquid <b>membrane</b> <b>processes</b> are studied theoretically and experimentally {{for the removal of}} ammonia from aqueous media containing ammonia or ammonia and carbon dioxide. The supported gas <b>membrane</b> <b>process,</b> the carrier-facilitated supported liquid <b>membrane</b> <b>process,</b> or their combination, can effective be used to remove ammonia as indicated by experimental data.

Two pretreatments were considered: flocculation and biofiltration. First, the flocculation process was optimized, taking into account two different coagulants and varying the dosage and the mixing procedure. The same wastewater was treated by a biological filter. The obtained pretreated solutions were then processed by using wound spiral membrane modules of ultrafiltration and nanofiltration to determine the critical flux for each <b>membrane</b> <b>process.</b> For both the examined <b>membrane</b> <b>processes</b> the critical flux value was around 40 % higher when the flocculation pretreatment was applied...|$|R
