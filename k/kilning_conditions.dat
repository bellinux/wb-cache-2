There were no major differences among the finished malts in parameters routinely used by the malting industry, including, moisture, color, and diastatic activity. Ferulic acid, esterase activity and free ferulic acid were higher in malts subjected to the coolest kilning regimen, but malt ethyl acetate extracts. (containing ferulic acid) contributed only similar to 5 % of the total malt antioxidant activity.

Transit time became sensitive to moisture content change at average moisture contents well above 30 %. The relationship between relative transit time and moisture content showed three linear regions that could be characterized by a three-component regression equation.

Mathematically modeling the rotary kiln used for the calcination of the coke is very difficult, because the main problem is that the relationships between input variables and control variables are complex, nonlinear, containing time lags and interrelationships, and that the kiln&# 39;s response to control inputs depends on the prevailing <b>kiln</b> <b>conditions.</b> A set of fuzzy control rules, which has successfully been used in controlling the petroleum coke calcining rotary kiln in a practical aluminum plant of China, is presented in this paper.

The fresh feed fed {{in at the}} top is first dried then heated to 800 °C, where de-carbonation begins, and proceeds progressively faster as the temperature rises. Below the burner, the hot lime transfers heat to, and is cooled by, the combustion air. A mechanical grate withdraws the lime at the bottom. A fan draws the gases through the kiln, and the level in the kiln is kept constant by adding feed through an airlock. As with batch kilns, only large, graded stone can be used, {{in order to ensure}} uniform gas-flows through the charge. The degree of burning can be adjusted by changing the rate of withdrawal of lime. Heat consumption as low as 4 MJ/kg is possible, but 4.5 to 5 MJ/kg is more typical.

30|$|Raman spectroscopic {{analysis}} of several shards recovered from two Portuguese shipwrecks, 1608 – 1643, {{believed to be}} carrying porcelains of the Ming period have revealed some interesting and novel results that inform historical ideas of porcelain production. Although the spectra generally reinforce earlier studies from similar material recovered from other shipwrecks off the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, in the period 1554 – 1650, some noteworthy differences are observed here. The detection of anatase almost exclusively in the porcelain bodies rather than rutile, the higher temperature stable form of titanium (II) oxide, indicates lower kiln temperatures. The discovery of β-wollastonite characteristic of soft-paste porcelains further suggests two of the shards (# 1 and # 3) being subjected to lower kiln temperatures. To date there are no studies which have found β-wollastonite in Ming period samples. Are these samples “interlopers” or are they are reflection {{of changes in the}} body composition of Ming factory porcelain production in its final years. It was quite common practice for other porcelain manufactories to experiment with their body composition and <b>kiln</b> <b>conditions</b> in an effort to minimise kiln wastage and in the search for higher quality; examples of this practice are the addition of glass frit to porcelains before firing to increase translucency—this was achieved but in practice such glassy porcelains were always rather unstable and kiln losses were significantly higher before bone ash made an entrance as a component.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect on}} ceramic {{products}} of firing {{conditions in the}} presence of abundant organic matter is assessed here experimentally by reproducing two ancient firing techniques: pit firing, characterised by a high heating rate and short residence time in a reducing atmosphere; kiln firing, with a low heating rate and long residence time in an oxidising atmosphere. As expected, pit firing conditions produced uniformly reduced ceramics, and gehlenite, diopside and spinet occurred at suitable temperatures (above 900 degrees C). Interestingly, in <b>kiln</b> firing <b>conditions,</b> sandwich structures formed in the ceramics, in which mineral assemblages and Fe oxidation state turned out to be different in the black core with respect to the margin. Spinel, cordierite and metallic Fe formed in the core, whereas hematite and spinel, in addition to gehlenite and diopside, crystallised in the margin at suitable temperatures (above 800 degrees C). Therefore, despite the oxidising atmosphere of the firing, reducing conditions occurred in the core, suggesting sluggish oxygen diffusion within the pottery. In addition, decomposition of reactant mineral phases and crystallisation of new mineral products in pit firing conditions occurred at temperatures about 50 degrees C higher than in <b>kiln</b> firing <b>conditions,</b> indicating that residence time strongly controlled reaction kinetics, as higher temperatures (i. e., a higher degree of reaction overstepping) are required when residence time is lower. On the contrary, illite broke down at a lower temperature than expected in both sets of firing conditions. This is interpreted as the effect of reduced water fugacity caused by burning of the organic matter...|$|R

The design of energy efficient dryers employing heat pump systems and the dynamic response of the product to the <b>kiln</b> <b>conditions</b> must take into account. In this paper, the formulation of a dynamic and kiln-wide drying model is described. The model predictions have been verified by comparing them with the published experimental data. The model is then used to simulate performance of three industrial kilns. Numerical experiments are carried out to investigate influence of key operating and design parameters on energy consumption of kilns. The model is also used to explore the possibility of manipulating temperature profile within the kiln to reduce energy consumption per tonne of clinker. Cement kiln dust is a fine-grained material produced during the manufacture of cement. At present reuse option is limited and the bulk of cement kiln dust that is not reused in the cement manufacturing process is sent to landfills or stored on-site. Due to the calcium oxide (CaO) content of cement kiln dust, it has the potential to be used as a replacement for lime in treating acidic wastewaters such as acid rock drainage. Slaking of two of the cement kiln dust samples with the highest free lime contents (e. g., 34 % and 37 % free of CaO) gave elevated pH values statistically comparable to those of the commercial quicklime sample that was characterized as having 87 % of CaO. Acid neutralization trials indicate that cement kiln dust samples with low free lime contents could be effective at neutralizing acidic wastewaters.

40|$|Aim of this {{research}} is an evaluation of the zeolitized facies of Campanian Ignimbrite as raw material for the production of lightweight expanded aggregates (LEA). A commercial product (Cab 70) was used as reference for this rock. Tests were carried out on “pure” samples or mixed with an industrial waste mud (DPM—Dried Polishing Mud) deriving from a porcelain stoneware tile polishing process. This mud contains SiC, a phase known to act as bloating enhancer. Raw materials were subjected tomineralogical (XRPD–RIR method) and chemical (XRF) analyses. Bloating upon heating was measured (Leitz heating microscope) on Cab 70, DPM and on three mixtures having the following Cab 70 /DPMratios: 85 / 15 (Mix 1); 70 / 30 (Mix 2); 50 / 50 (Mix 3). LEAproductionwas assessed both in static (muffle kiln) and in dynamic (rotating <b>kiln)</b> <b>conditions</b> by firing pellets, 3 – 8 mm in size, between 1220 – 1380 °C. The unit weight of the single particle was determined on fired and unfired products. All materials evidenced a decreasing density with temperature whereas the same parameter decreases with DPM increasing content. Cab 70 LEAs never dropped below 0. 90 g/cm 3, even at the highest temperature, whereas DPM LEAs range between 0. 86 g/cm 3 (at 1260 °C) and 0. 46 g/cm 3 (at 1380 °C). A direct but not linear relationship between DPMcontent and density was evidenced. Among the three mixtures,Mix 2 showed the lowest DPMcontent able to produce the strongest density reduction. To get LEAs with the same density the rotating kiln required temperatures generally 60 – 80 °C higher than those of the muffle kiln. This difference should be related to the different thermal insulation of the two systems during firing. Two sets of LEAs were massively produced in dynamic conditions from Cab 70 (at 1380 °C) and Mix 2 (at 1300 °C). These latter showed better technical performances in terms of unit weight of the single particle (0. 81 vs. 0. 98 g/cm 3), bulk unit weight (460 vs. 565 kg/m 3), water absorption coefficients (1. 4 vs. 5. 5 % after 24 h) and compressive strength of the particles (2. 9 vs. 0. 6 MPa). Differences in pore shape, dimension, abundance and spatial distribution were observed by SEMbetween the two sets. The technical features of these LEAs were comparable to some expanded clays, with similar grain size, commercialised in Italy. These results are worth interesting as they reveal new perspectives of application both for a rock characterized by a low exploitation cost and widely available in central-southern Italy, as well as for an industrial waste produced in high amount but not recycled at all...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overall {{assessment of the}} environmental effects of co-incineration of cutting oil emulsions in cement plants through the quantification of emissions of key pollutants, namely NOx, CO and VOC. Two realistic scenarios are considered. In the first, the cutting oil emulsion is injected directly into the rotary kiln while the second scenario involves injection of the cutting oil emulsion in the tertiary air stream and thus directly into the precalciner. A detailed kinetic PSR modelling study is performed for combustion conditions relevant both to cement kiln and precalciner operating conditions. It is demonstrated that, although NOx emissions from the precalciner are generally substantially lower than those from the cement kiln, emulsion injection in the latter appears to be favourable and can lead up to 50 % reductions in NO levels. However, injection of cutting oil emulsion with relatively high nitrogen content in the precalciner may lead, under lean conditions, to increases in the emitted NO levels. The effect of cutting oil emulsion on CO and VOC emissions both under cement <b>kiln</b> and precalciner <b>conditions</b> is also quantified. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The effects of <b>kilning</b> and tempering <b>conditions</b> (30, 60 or 90 min at 80, 95 or 110 degrees C) on flake peroxidase activity, size, thickness, strength and water absorption were therefore determined. After kilning, some peroxidase activity remained but steaming and tempering effectively destroyed the activity of these enzymes. Thus the supposed protective effect of kilning or groat durability was not confirmed. Kilning resulted in an increase in flake specific weight, but no other significant effect on flake quality was observed. Tempering time and temperature interacted significantly to produce complex effects on flake specific weight, thickness and water absorption. Flake thickness and specific weight were significantly correlated (r = 0. 808, n = 54). Longer tempering times resulted in an increased fines' fraction, from 1. 45 % at 30 min to 1. 75 % at 90 min.

40|$|HF (hydrogen fluoride) {{emission}} control {{is one of}} the critical environmental parameters in the firing of ceramic materials at peak temperatures higher than 1000 °C. In this study, in-stack concentrations of HF were monitored on-line with laser-based equipment during the fast firing of ceramic tiles in continuous industrial roller hearth kilns under standard <b>kiln</b> operating <b>conditions.</b> Three different ceramic tile compositions: porous red-body wall tiles, red-body stoneware tiles, and porcelain tiles were fired in industrial kilns customarily used to manufacture these types of tiles, modifying the heating rate and tile dry bulk density. The in-stack concentrations of HF can be explained on the basis of tile HF adsorption and emission processes in the kiln preheating and firing zones, analysed in previous studies. The methodology used in this study has significant advantages for industrial studies compared with previous methodologies based primarily on laboratory-scale studies and analysis of solid material. The main advantages are: (a) rapid response, allowing abrupt changes in the HF emission to be studied; and (b) direct measurement of the in-stack concentration of HF, which is the most common parameter used as a legal limit for industrial {{emission control}}. The study shows that tile HF adsorption in the preheating zone is very important. It also shows that HF stack emissions can vary significantly in continuous kilns depending on whether glazed or unglazed tiles are produced, or important changes occur in production (such as gaps in the kiln feed). The results indicate, furthermore, that HF stack emissions do not decrease significantly when realistic changes are made in industrial operating conditions if these industrial kilns are run at peak temperatures above 1100 °C. The most important reduction in in-stack concentrations of HF is observed when glazed ceramic tiles are fired, so further research in this field can be made in order to reduce HF emissions. © 2009 Elsevier B.

To achieve these goals an ambitious program of work involving both experimental and numerical modelling was completed. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop models that are capable of predicting the temperature profile in the pilot kiln and its variation with change in operating parameters, as this would indicate that the model is capable of simulating the heat transfer processes in an actual operating kiln. The project was completed in July 2005 with research conducted in three areas. Pilot Kiln studies: A series of experiments to collect data on heat transfer have been carried out for two particle size distributions, varying rotation speed, temperature and feed rate. This provides a valuable set of data in a realistic but controlled experimental arrangement {{that can be used for}} model development and validation. DEM modelling: Heat conduction and advection have been added to the DEM code in work carried out outside this project. A model with a 2 D simulation of a 1 m diameter lab-scale kiln operating at 30 % critical speed shows strong mixing towards thermal homogeneity as the initially separated hot and cold regions wrap around each other. These simulations establish that the heat conduction model is operating reasonably. CFD Modelling: The CFD modelling work was delayed waiting for experimental data to be obtained. Modelling of the flame of the pilot kiln has been carried out as the first stage of the model development, and this has been linked to a 1 D model of the bed.

Approximately half of the effort put into the investigations was concentrated on laboratory tests while the remaining effort was concentrated on modelling the observations made in the tests. The results from the investigations are published or submitted for publication in eight papers. Paper I : In this paper methods for testing the hygro-mechanical behaviour of small clear wood specimen are evaluated and discussed. The equipment used for conducting the tests is thoroughly described. It was concluded that the equipment showed good potential to perform tests on the specimen in variable climate and that the methods for testing were reliable. Paper II : Results from performed tests on small clear wood specimens in climates representative for kiln drying of sawn timber are presented in this paper. Evaluations of the tests also showed that the hygro-mechanical behaviour at high temperatures and high moisture content consists of both mechano-sorption and time induced creep. Paper III : A material model for drying wood at constant temperatures on the material point level is presented in this paper. The model was calibrated against results. It was found that the material model predicted the response from climate and load action in small specimens.

Also, a two dimensional model was developed and is presented in this paper. Paper V : Results from tests on small clear wood specimens for indoor climates with single cycles of humidity are presented in this paper. The mechano-sorptive strain was found to be independent of moisture level and rate of moisture change, but strongly dependent on the magnitude of moisture change.

40|$|Measuring the {{temperature}} distribution inside the rotary kilns, using thermocouples for instance {{has proven to}} be difficult due to the harsh operating <b>conditions</b> of the <b>kiln.</b> Numerical modelling of turbulent combustion and the associated physical phenomenon thus proves to be an indispensable tool towards predicting the <b>kiln</b> operating <b>conditions.</b> The purpose of the present work was to make a step towards modelling the cement rotary kiln used by Almatis B. V. in Rotterdam for the production of calcium-aluminate cement. The detailed mathematical model of the rotary kiln would be developed using the open source CFD toolbox OpenFOAM. The main advantage of OpenFOAM is that, contrary to most of the commercial CFD software, it is license fee free and allows access to the source code, which was also the motivation behind this work. To accurately model the Almatis kiln the following important phenomenon have to be taken into account: turbulent non-premixed combustion of hydrocarbon gases in the burner, radiative heat transfer distribution in the kiln and, the conjugate heat transfer through the furnace walls. In the present work the new solver implemented in OpenFOAM for turbulent combustion and radiation modelling was validated using the benchmark Sandia Flame D test case. There was good agreement seen between the results from simulations and experimental data for the Sandia Flame D test case indicating the adequacy and accuracy of the implemented transient solver and its readiness for further combustion application development. Due to the very complex geometry of the Almatis Kiln the relatively simple geometry of the Burner Flow Reactor (BFR) was considered for further simulations. The simulation results obtained for the Burner Flow Reactor (BFR) were compared with the commercial package ANSYS Fluent for consistency. The OpenFOAM toolbox was evaluated in two stages of increasing complexity: isothermal(cold) flow simulation and non-premixed gas combustion simulation using a turbulent incompressible flow solver. The cold flow comparison gave almost identical results for both OpenFOAM and ANSYS Fluent. However the reacting flow results showed varying agreement with ANSYS Fluent. The mass fraction of species showed good agreement but {{the temperature}} profile showed some deviations. With more stringent global NOx emission standards, predicting NOx formation in industrial furnaces is now a priority. The CFD modelling of pollutant NOx formation was considered in the present work. A new solver in OpenFOAM was developed for thermal NO prediction. The solver was validated with the ANSYS Fluent NOx post-processing utility using the Burner Flow Reactor geometry. The effectiveness of NOx reduction mechanisms including the variation of air to fuel equivalence ratio and flue gas re-circulation (FGR) was demonstrated using the Burner Flow Reactor test case. From this study it was concluded that OpenFOAM is a promising toolbox for modelling turbulent combustion and can be used for predicting the operating conditions of complex industrial furnaces. The current bottleneck identified with OpenFOAM is the very high computational cost of the implemented transient solver for turbulent combustion and radiation modelling. The computational cost of the transient solver far exceeds that of the steady state solvers available in commercial packages for example ANSYS Fluent. Therefore, to simulate very large scale industrial furnaces such as the Almatis Kiln in realizable time the implementation of a steady state solver for turbulent combustion applications in OpenFOAM is indispensable. It would also be essential to include the accompanying phenomenon of conjugate heat transfer into the solver. These can be accomplished {{as a part of the}} future work.

40|$|This present {{research}} aims {{to obtain a}} fundamental understanding on solid transport, solid mixing and the complex heat transfer mechanisms related to the important installed segmented lifter in an indirectly heated rotary kiln. To accomplish these objectives in a systematic manner, the experimental and modelling studies on solid transport and mixing were first carried out in pilot-scale cold kilns at Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Western Australia then followed by heat transfer study in a pilot-scale hot kiln system available at ANSAC Pty Ltd, Bunbury, Western Australia. For design and scaling purposes, dimensional analysis was carried out. A series of experiments in cold kilns were also carried out, considering lifter design, lifter configurations, helix, a wide-range of solid and various kiln designs under different <b>kiln</b> operating <b>conditions.</b> The results showed that a flat bed depth profile can be achieved using purposely-designed segmented lifters at favourable practical low ReѠ values (less energy input to drive the kilns and more throughputs), with a low total kiln filling fraction and {{a high degree of}} axial mixing (Pe < 50 or Dz = 10 - 5 - 10 - 3 m 2 /s). This is essential to good heat transfer performance. The effects of helix, L/D, Fr and d/D have relatively insignificant differences on solid transport and mixing under the current experimental conditions. These findings demonstrate the unique advantages of the purposely-designed segmented lifters compared to other conventional lifters (e. g. single throughout lifters), providing important information for scaling criteria and modelling work. A preliminary DEM simulation, as an emerging simulation tool at a particle level, confirmed that axial displacement is mainly due to the function of the folded lifter sections of the segmented lifters. The folded lifter sections push the solids towards the kiln discharge end along the bed arc length and such effect increases as Reincreases. This finding leads {{to the development of a}} transport model, limited to underloading regimes, to predict the average bed depth in this type of kilns. The model predictions are in good agreement with experimental data. A set of global power-law dimensionless empirical correlations on solid transport and mixing, applicable to all three (over-, design-, underloading) regimes, were also developed based on the data obtained from our systematic experiments. The validity was tested with data presented in selected previous studies. It is found that the developed correlations are largely specific to the present lifter design and configurations. A steady-state axial heat transfer model has also been developed for a kiln with segmented lifters. The model predicts the temperature profiles at inner heat tube, in the freeboard gas, in the bed, on the tube wall and the outer heat tube in the flue gas. The model incorporates developed solid transport and mixing correlations, as well as suitable heat transfer modes and reaction model. It takes the form of ordinary differential equations which were solved numerically. The input data necessary for the model were obtained by our own experiments and/or extracted from the literature. The model was validated by the temperature profiles obtained from the hot kiln. Among the heat transfer modes considered, it is found that the limiting step of heat transfer in the kiln is the heat transfer from covered inner kiln wall to covered bed, which is highly influenced by solid transport and mixing. Under the current experimental conditions, the typical overall heat transfer coefficient was found to be 31 - 35 W/m 2. K. The {{present research}} advances the fundamental understanding on solid transport, solid mixing and the complex heat transfer mechanisms in an indirectly heated rotary kiln with segmented lifters. The obtained data and knowledge are important to improve the kiln energy efficiency, reduce kiln manufacture and operation costs and widen the kiln applications at different scales...|$|R

The studies presented in this thesis focus on how the size of the batches treated and the size of the individual wood samples treated influence the process and resulting properties of the wood. The aim of the studies, the so called researchquestion in the context of a PhD-thesis, is to help transfer knowledge gained from testing small wooden samples in laboratories to industrial treatment of full size timber. This thesis describes studies on vacuum drying, high temperature (HT) drying, and thermal modification of wood according to the Thermowood© process. Drying and thermal modification of wood have been studied under industrial andlaboratory <b>conditions.</b> <b>Kiln</b> climates and wood response have been determined during vacuum drying, conventional drying, high temperature drying, and thermal modification. The results show that both the size of the material treated and the size of the kiln or batch strongly influence the processes and the resulting wood properties. The results show that the sample size influences different material properties in different ways. Equilibrium moisture content is reduced less during thermal treatment of small clear wood specimens than during treatment of dimensionaltimber. Mass loss on the other hand is higher in small samples. Reduction in impact bending strength, mass loss, and reduction in EMC after thermal treatment of dimensional timber do not seem to be correlated. Laboratory treatment of small clear wood specimens show considerably stronger influence on the wood properties than treatment of similar samples together with industrial production.

40|$|International audienceRotary kilns are gas-solid {{reactors}} {{commonly used}} in industry to achieve {{a wide range of}} material processing operations: mixing, heating or cooling, reacting of coarse, free-flowing or cohesive solids. Therefore rotary kilns are used for applications such as reduction of oxide ore, pyrolysis of biomass or hazardous waste, calcining of petroleum coke, conversion of uranium fluoride for the manufacture of nuclear fuel, and so on. When operated at atmospheric pressure, these units consist of a cylindrical shell that can be inclined, into which the solids burden is fed continuously at one end and discharged at the other. Most of them are equipped with lifting flights or lifters, and/or exit dam at the kiln outlet end. They can be classified into two main heating modes; they can be either directly heated or indirectly heated, depending on the heating source position with respect to the kiln’s tube wall. They usually require very little labor to operate in comparison with other industrial reactors. Though operational cost of these units is usually high, their design and intended operating conditions are often conservative {{due to the lack of}} fundamental understanding notably upon the solids flow behavior and the heat transfer mechanisms. Heat transfer in rotary kilns is very complex and may involve the exchange of energy via all the fundamental physical transfer mechanisms that are, conduction, convection, and radiation. There have been quite a few studies dealing with this subject in the literature. Although many researchers studied the main phenomena occurring in the kiln, the heat transfer between the wall and solid particles, or the (free) convection of non forced gas are not yet well understood. The present study investigates the convective gas-to-wall heat transfer coefficient, in the case of a non-forced air flow, and the wall-to-solids heat transfer coefficient. These coefficients were first experimentally determined, and then correlated based on a dimensional analysis, so to be used in a global model for rotary kilns. A series of experiments were carried out on a pilot scale rotary kiln at atmospheric pressure, whether or not equipped with lifters and fitted with a dam at the outlet end. The experimental apparatus, 1. 95 m in length and 0. 01 m in (internal) diameter, can be externally heated in two independent consecutive zones by electrical resistance up to 1000 °C. Regarding the thermal metrology, thermocouples are positioned at five and four cross-sections, respectively in and outside along the kiln tube. Hence, after turning on the heating system, axial temperature profiles of gas, wall and solids were measured until steady state is achieved. Both coefficients were determined from the temperature profiles measurements data for low and medium wall temperature set point comprises between 100 and 500 °C. In particular for the wall-to-solids heat transfer coefficient, the bulk materials used was quartz sand (average size about half a millimeter) with a narrow distributed size fraction; No solids were fed into the kiln when studying the air convection inside the kiln. Two shapes of lifters were compared to determine the influence of lifters presence and their geometry on the heat transfer: straight (one-section) lifters and rectangular (two-section) lifters (RL). The <b>kiln</b> operating <b>conditions</b> examined also include: the rotational speed (2 - 12 rpm), the mass flow rate (0. 8 - 2. 5 kg/h) and the exit dam height at the kiln outlet end (23. 5 - 33. 5 mm). An experimental matrix of about eighty experiments was achieved. For the determination of the experimental value, the lumped system analysis and a heat balance accounting for the measured power supplied for the heating are used. Results showed that the wall-to-gas convective heat transfer coefficient is significantly lower that what can be expected for natural convection. Though only small variations were observed, still some trends could be observed in presence of lifters, and when varying the rotational speed. The wall-to-solids heat transfer coefficient was notably lower in presence of lifters. It was also found to increase with the temperature set at the wall and the filling degree, which is imposed by the operating conditions set. Dimensional correlations were developed to describe these two heat transfer mechanisms from the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{investigations}} into the influence of heat treatment on the manufacturing of oat flakes. Sources of variation in the oat flake quality are reviewed, including the whole chain from the farm to the consumer. The most important quality parameters of oat flakes are the absence of lipid hydrolysing enzymes, specific weight, thickness, breakage (fines), water absorption. Flavour, colour and pasting properties are also important, but {{were not included in}} the experimental part of this study. Of particular interest was the role of heat processing. The first possible heat treatment may occur already during grain drying, which in Finland generally happens at the farm. At the mill, oats are often kilned to stabilise the product by inactivating lipid hydrolysing enzymes. Almost invariably steaming is used during flaking, to soften the groats and reduce flake breakage. This thesis presents the use of a material science approach to investigating a complex system, typical of food processes. A combination of fundamental and empirical rheological measurements was used together with a laboratory scale process to simulate industrial processing. The results were verified by means of industrial trials. Industrially produced flakes at three thickness levels (nominally 0. 75, 0. 85 and 0. 90 mm) were produced from kilned and unkilned oat groats, and the flake strength was measured at different moisture contents. Kilning was not found to significantly affect the force required to puncture a flake with a 2 mm cylindrical probe, which was taken as a measure of flake strength. To further investigate how heat processing contributes to flake quality, dynamic mechanical analysis was used to characterise the effect of heat on the mechanical properties of oats. A marked stiffening of the groat, of up to about 50 % increase in storage modulus, was observed during first heating at around 36 to 57 °C. This was also observed in tablets prepared from ground groats and extracted oat starch. This stiffening was thus attributed to increased adhesion between starch granules. Groats were steamed in a laboratory steamer and were tempered in an oven at 80 110 °C for 30 90 min. The maximum force required to compress the steamed groats to 50 % strain increased from 50. 7 N to 57. 5 N as the tempering temperature was increased from 80 to 110 °C. Tempering conditions also affected water absorption. A significantly higher moisture content was observed for kilned (18. 9 %) compared to unkilned (17. 1 %) groats, but otherwise had no effect on groat height, maximum force or final force after a 5 s relaxation time. Flakes were produced from the tempered groats using a laboratory flaking machine, using a roll gap of 0. 4 mm. Apart from specific weight, flake properties were not influenced by <b>kilning.</b> Tempering <b>conditions</b> however had significant effects on the specific weight, thickness and water absorption of the flakes, as well as on the amount of fine material (< 2 mm) produced during flaking. Flake strength correlated significantly with groat strength and flake thickness. Trial flaking at a commercial mill confirmed that groat temperature after tempering influenced water absorption. Variation in flake strength was observed, but at the groat temperatures required to inactivate lipase, it was rather small. Cold flaking of groats resulted in soft, floury flakes. The results presented in this thesis suggest that heating increased the adhesion between starch granules. This resulted in an increase in the stiffness and brittleness of the groat. Brittle fracture, rather than plastic flow, during flaking could result in flaws and cracks in the flake. These would be expected to increase water absorption. This was indeed observed as tempering temperature increased. Industrial trials, conducted with different groat temperatures, confirmed the main findings of the laboratory experiments. The approach used in the present study allowed the systematic study of the effect of interacting process parameters on product quality. There have been few scientific studies of oat processing, and these results can be used to understand the complex effects of process variables on flake quality. They also offer an insight into what happens as the oat groat is deformed into a flake...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{concern about}} {{environmental}} problems has amplified the public`s interest inenergy usage. The improved subsidies for biomass, {{together with the}} rising energy priceshave made biomass a desirable product on the energy market. Energy intensive industries inthe field of wood and biomass now have nowadays an opportunity to decrease energyconsumption and to sell their biomass surplus on the energy market. This Licentiate thesis focuses on strategies to decrease biomass usage in sawmill industriesin order to increase their surplus biomass and increase their profit. This is done throughsystem analysis of sawmill industries in terms of mass and energy flows. The energyanalysis focuses on the drying kiln using psychrometric and thermodynamic relationships. State-of-the-art technologies, available on the market, have been studied to determine theirpossible effect on the total energy usage in the sawmills. This study was undertaken to determine the national use of energy due to sawmills and thepotential magnitude of improvements. Sawmills are important suppliers to the biomassmarket, since medium to large capacity sawmills contribute with 95 % of the Swedish annuallumber (sawn boards) production (17. 3 Mm 3) with a lumber interchange of only 47 %. Therest of the timber (unsawn logs) is transformed into biomass through the lumber productionprocesses. An essential part (12 %) of the timber is used for supplying heat to the productionprocesses, mainly to the drying process {{which is the most}} time and heat consuming processin the sawmill. The main conclusions are that the heat demand for drying lumber in Swedishsawmills was found to be 4. 9 TWh per year and the drying process can be made moreeffective by use of state-of-the-art technologies. Hence the internal use of biomass insawmills can be decreased, thereby increasing the biomass that can be sold to the marketand/or to generate heat and/or electricity, resulting in more profitable sawmills and asignificant increased supply of biomass to the market. It was also found that with available state-of-the-art technologies it is possible to recycle theheat in the evacuated air from the dryer, and if the recovered heat is used for heat sinksinside or close to the sawmill a large decrease of the energy usage can be achieved. If thetechnologies are implemented up to 5. 56 TWh of equivalent biomass can be saved,depending on the technology, the specific sawmill <b>conditions,</b> <b>kiln</b> settings and dryingsystem operation. However, some of the considered technologies consume a substantialamount of electricity, so the economic benefit should be carefully evaluated.

Porselen karolar düşük su emmeli, yüksek mekanik mukavemet gösteren, az leke tutan, sırlı ve sırsız olarak iç ve dış mekanlarda kullanılan ürünlerdir. İstenen bu özelliklerin sağlanabilmesi için son zamanlarda ekonomik nedenlerden dolayı geleneksel hammaddelerin yanında alternatif hammadde kaynakların kullanılması da gündemdedir. Bu çalışmada ilk olarak mikrogranit malzemesi farklı tane boyutlarına getirilerek inceltilmiş ve bu malzemenin fiziksel ve termal özellikleri incelenmiştir. Daha sonra {{standart}} bir komposizyonda ergitici olarak kullanılan sodyum feldspat yerine reçeteye ince mikrogranit malzemesi % 8 ile % 20 arasında değişen oranlarda katılmıştır. Farklı oranlardaki bu katkıların son ürüne olan etkisini görmek amacıyla elde edilen nihai ürünlere su emme, pişme küçülmesi, mukavemet ve renk “L a b” testleri uygulanmıştır. Ayrıca, mikroyapıyı incelemek amacıyla da XRD ve SEM çalışmaları yapılmıştır. Gerçekleştirilen çalışmalar sonucunda ince mikrogranit malzemesinin komposizyona ilavesinin camsı fazın viskozitesini düşürdüğü, sinterleme sıcaklığı ve maksimum sıcaklıkta bekleme süresini azalttığı belirlenmiştir. In this study, microgranite {{samples were}} collected from a large ceramic production region in Karakoy located in the Southeast part of Bilecik province inTurkey (NW Turkey). Due to its high alkaline (Na 2 O+ K 2 O ~ 8. 0 - 8. 5) and low Fe 2 O 3, TiO 2 content, {{it is likely to}} consider microgranite as a fluxing agent for porcelain tile bodies. In {{the first part of the}} experimental study, both as-received and 270 min. attrition milled microgranite samples were added into the glazed porcelain body in the following proportions 8 %, 12 %, 16 %, 20 % meanwhile albite was removed from the Standard body formulation. Following the wet ball milling of standard body and studied porcelain bodies, some test samples were prepared according to Standard test procedure. The prepared samples were then taken to fast firing process in roller <b>kilns</b> under industrial <b>conditions</b> of 1200 °C and 49 min. Prior to firing process slip properties of density (g/l), flow rate (s) and sieve residue (+ 63 p) were measured. Following this, the properties of fired body samples such as bulk density, shrinkage (%), water absorption (%), dry and fired strength and colour measurements expressed as L, a and b were measured as well. When compared with Standard body, the results showed that the increase in microgranite amount decreased the water absorption and increased shrinkage and fired strength. Non-contact dilatometric analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were performed to determine the thermal expansion behaviours of the bodies, thermal behaviours of the bodies and the phases, respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was further employed to observe the microstructure of the fired microgranite samples with respect to firing temperature. Moreover after firing process under industrial conditions quartz, plagioclase and mullite phases were detected in the bodies as the main phases. Based on these analyses and observations made during this study, it has been concluded that very fine grained microgranite material can be used in glazed porcelain tile bodies as a very good fluxing agent which leads to the suggestion that the removal of albite taken from £ine-Aydm region from the body recipe can be taken into consideration...|$|R

Applications of bamboo vinegars on inhibit plant pathogenic bacteria, and the synergism of bamboo vinegar combined with chitosan a bacteriostatic action was also studied. Thirty-two kinds of moso bamboo vinegar were collected using a steel <b>kiln</b> under various <b>conditions</b> of temperature range from 150 ~ 200 ℃, 200 ~ 250 ℃, 250 ~ 300 ℃, 300 ~ 350 ℃, 350 ~ 400 ℃, 400 ~ 450 ℃, 450 ~ 500 ℃, and from 150 ~ 500 ℃ at heating rates of 25, 50, 75, and 100 ℃/hr, respectively. The fundamental properties including total yields, color, pH, specific gravity, organic acid content, and soluble tar content in bamboo vinegars were examined. The results showed that the yields of bamboo vinegars was about 10 ％, and the yields decreased with increasing of heating rate. More than 77 ％ of total bamboo vinegars were collected at the temperature range from 150 ~ 300 ℃. The bamboo vinegars collected from 250 ~ 300 ℃ and 150 ~ 500 ℃ had the darkest color, and from 200 ~ 250 ℃ had the lowest pH, and from 250 ~ 300 ℃ had the highest amount of organic acid and soluble tar content. However, the specific gravity of bamboo vinegars increased with increasing the collected temperature. In addition, the organic constituents of bamboo vinegars by GC-MS analysis showed that major products in bamboo vinegars were acid components in all treatments, and the amount of acid components decreased with increasing the heating rate. However, the neutral components and the phenol components increased and became more complicated in their chemical structures with increasing the heating rate. Moreover, the results of GC-MS analysis reviewed that the major constituent in acid components was acetic acid, and the neutral components were cyclopentanol and butyrolactone, and phenol components were 2, 6 -dimethoxy-phenol and phenol. In order to understand the antibacterial activity of bamboo vinegars, five plant pathogenic bacteria including bacterial wilt of tomato, bacterial blight of rice, black rot of crucifers, bacterial spot of carambola, and bacterial blotch of cucurbits were investigated by disc agar diffusion test method and dilution method. The results showed that bamboo vinegars could effectively inhibit the grown of plant pathogenic bacteria. Consideration of the percentage of inhibition and yield of bamboo vinegars, the best manufacturing conditions of bamboo vinegars against the growth of plant pathogenic bacteria were the temperature range of 150 ~ 500 ℃ at heating rates of 25 and 50 ℃/hr, or the collecting temperature over 250 ℃ at heating rates of 75 and 100 ℃/hr. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of bamboo vinegars against plant pathogenic bacteria were 500 ~ 700 times dilution of original vinegar which collected from 150 ~ 500 ℃ at heating rate of 25 ℃/hr. Meanwhile, the synergy effect of chitosan and bamboo vinegar on inhibit the grown of plant pathogenic bacteria was also observed, better results were shown in the mixtures of bamboo vinegars and higher degree of deacetylation and higher concentration of chitosan. 本研究係探討不同炭化升溫速率和不同收集溫度範圍竹醋液之基本性質，並分析竹醋液對抑制植物病原細菌之效果，及幾丁聚醣和竹醋液抑菌之協同作用。將孟宗竹以機械窯依 25 、 50 、 75 和 100 ℃/hr等 4 種炭化升溫速率炭化，分段收集 150 ~ 200 ℃、 200 ~ 250 ℃、 250 ~ 300 ℃、 300 ~ 350 ℃、 350 ~ 400 ℃、 400 ~ 450 ℃及 450 ~ 500 ℃等溫度範圍與不分溫度範圍 150 ~ 500 ℃一次收集之 32 種竹醋液，分別探討其收率、顏色、pH值、比重、有機酸含量、溶解焦油含量及組成分等基本性質。試驗結果得知，竹醋液總收率隨升溫速率上升而下降，約佔 10 ％左右，主要收集之百分率集中在 150 ~ 300 ℃，可達總收率之 77 ％以上；不論在何種炭化升溫速率下，竹醋液之顏色以分段收集之 250 ~ 300 ℃及一次收集之 150 ~ 500 ℃者為最深，pH值則以 200 ~ 250 ℃者最低，比重隨收集溫度範圍上升而增加，有機酸和溶解焦油含量以 250 ~ 300 ℃者為最多。以氣相層析-質譜儀（GC-MS）分析得知，竹醋液有機成分，不論何種炭化升溫速率之各種溫度範圍均以acetic acid（醋酸）為主之酸性物質最多，隨著升溫速率上升酸性物質含量明顯減少，而中性物質與酚類物質含量卻增加，種類亦更多元，又中性物質主要成分為環戊醇（cyclopentanol）和丁酸內酯（butyrolactone），而酚類物質以 2, 6 -雙甲氧基酚（ 2, 6 -dimethoxy-phenol）和酚（phenol）為主。 採用瓊脂紙錠擴散試驗法和稀釋試驗法分析竹醋液抑制植物病原細菌（包括番茄青枯病菌、水稻白葉枯病菌、十字花科黑腐病菌、楊桃細菌性斑點病菌和瓜類細菌性果斑病菌系 5 種）之效能，由試驗結果得知，竹醋液可有效抑制植物病原細菌之生長，綜合抑菌率及竹醋液的收率，建議採用升溫速率 25 和 50 ℃/hr之 150 ~ 500 ℃一次收集者，或升溫速率 75 和 100 ℃/hr於 250 ℃以後溫度收集之竹醋液，對抑制植物病原細菌最具效果。又以升溫速率 25 ℃/hr之一次收集竹醋液為例，其最低抑制濃度約為 500 ~ 700 倍竹醋液稀釋液至之間。又竹醋液中添加幾丁聚醣可以顯著抑制番茄青枯病原細菌，且隨其去乙醯度及其濃度之增加，抑菌效果愈佳摘要i Abstractii 目錄iv 圖目次v 表目次vi 第一章 前言 1 第二章	炭化升溫速率對竹醋液基本性質之響 3 第三章	竹醋液之抗植物病原細菌試驗 33 第四章	竹醋液添加幾丁聚醣之抑菌協同作用 52 第五章	結論 69 第六章	參考文獻 7...|$|R
40|$|Rotary kilns are {{important}} {{in a variety of}} different manufacturing areas for e. g. calcination and sintering of materials. In fact, two of the most produced materials in the world, cement and iron, are likely to start their journey in a rotary kiln. A rotary kiln is a large cylinder-formed furnace which rotates about its axis and where certain chemical and physical reactions take place by the influence of heat. The slope and the rotation make the material inside to move through the kiln from feed to discharge end. Due to high process temperatures the casing of the kiln is insulated by a refractory lining. Service <b>conditions</b> inside the <b>kiln</b> are rough and the lining is continuously degrading, especially pronounced in the hot zone of the kiln. If the lining is significantly deteriorated and can no longer protect the casing from the heat − the production is shut-down − leading to very high production losses. Despite many improvements of rotary kilns in the past decades there is still a gap in the knowledge regarding refractory linings during usage. Many assumptions are based on practical knowledge. One explanation to this could be the difficulty to study and observe the lining due to kiln size and high operating temperatures. Today, computer programs are of a great help for studying various issues without causing production delays or risking failures. However, the field of rotary kilns has stagnated on this matter and very little documentation can be found regarding numerical simulations of the lining, especially of the thermomechanical character. Purpose of this licentiate work is to study the mechanical behaviour of the lining by means of the finite element method (FEM). For this, a simplified model of a kiln was created and various fundamental cases were studied. The commercial FE-software LS-DYNA is used for the FE-calculations. The main work is based on cases of the <b>kiln</b> in cold <b>condition.</b> However, an initial study in warm condition is presented as well. The studied lining was a brick lining used in a kiln of dimensions typical for iron-ore pelletizing. Additionally, this licentiate thesis gives an overview {{of some of the most}} fundamental issues encountered in a refractory brick lining of a rotary kiln in general. Some material tests are presented as well. Model’s geometry was based on a section at the position of the support wheels, having a thickness of one brick. Some simplifications, such as choice of the material model and a rigid riding tyre, were done and a three-fold faster computational time was achieved. Response of the created model was partly verified analytically, by available in-house data and data from literature. It was confirmed that the model gives a good response. One of the important findings is that despite variation of conditions in cold state, e. g. rotational speed and relative ovality of the kiln, the induced stresses in the lining remained harmless. This challenges traditional believes which imply that ovality is of considerable importance for stress generation in the lining. On the other hand, by continuously tracing gaps between the bricks and the casing, it was found that integrity of the lining was significantly affected by rotational speed and ovality. Gaps as large as 80 mm could be observed between bricks and casing in a worst case scenario. An initial study on the kiln in hot state was made. Thermal expansion of a perfectly lined and an disordered brick lining were performed. The results indicate that stresses due to thermal expansion are rising slightly but are harmless in both cases. Additionally, expansion of the kiln stabilizes the lining and the effect of rotation compared to rotation in cold state is small. Analytical and numerical calculations were compared, indicating that analytical assumptions are often coarse and misleading from the reality.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work is to enable design and {{manufacture}} of cement with emphasis on the quality and the properties of cement. Data used in the design and manufacture were collected from predictions of properties and characteristics of cement. The properties of cement were predicted from its characteristics and from the production <b>conditions</b> in cement <b>kiln</b> and mill. The cement characteristics were in some investigations predicted from the production conditions. The design was based on sensitivity analysis focusing the influence of the characteristics and production variables, x, on the properties, y. The influence was analyzed by predictions of y from the simulated variation in x. In cases there were correlation within observation matrix X, the simulations were constrained by the latent structure of X. The simulations were in the form of optimization of the function for prediction of y. The optimal solutions of the production variables were then implemented in the manufacture of cement. The prediction models were evaluated by multivariate data analysis by using partial least square regression (PLS). PLS {{is a member of the}} bilinear class of methods. The method compresses the observation matrix X to its most relevant factors and using these compressed variables as regressors for y. In the thesis the compressed variables were sometimes called PLS-components and sometimes latent variables. Two types of sensitivity analysis for the examination of influences of the x -variables on y were applied. The first is based on comparison of the size and certainty of the regression coefficient from PLS on scaled and weighted x. The second was based on predictions of y from simulated variation in x. The influence of a single x -variable or a latent variable was valued or ranged from the variation of predicted y relative to the confidence intervals of y. The development of a program for optimization was an important part of work presented in the thesis. The optimization was in the form of linear programming where the regression function of y was optimized but constrained by the latent variables and upper and lower limits of at least one of the x -variables. The purpose was not to focus only on the methods but also to apply the methods on real data from production and characterization of cement for prediction of the quality and the properties of cement. Two investigations were performed on pure observations of X and Y. In the first investigation three PLS-models were evaluated for prediction of the three properties; amount of water required to achieve standard consistency, setting time and compressive strength at 1 day from production conditions in a cement mill. In the second investigation, a PLS-model was evaluated for predictions of compressive strength up to 28 days from characteristics of the cement. The observation X was made up by four submatrices representing three different types of characteristics, the first one representing the mineralogy of the clinker part of the cement, the second the particle size distribution and the third and fourth superficial microstructure of cement. The mineralogy characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis could be related to the production conditions in the cement kiln. The particle size distribution and superficial microstructure, the latter characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, could be related to the production conditions in a cement mill. From the observation X matrix an artificial observation matrix was made for predicting potential compressive strength of clinker from the mineralogy. The original variation in the mineralogy in the new artificial matrix was maintained, while the other variables were kept constant and equal to their mean values. The mineralogy was represented by XRDcurves, which are characterized as spectral data, in two selected 2 _ ranges. Further, the spectral data were optimized to min and max potential compressive strength. In addition, they were interpreted qualitatively with respect to the variation in the mineralogy. The spectral data from thermogravimetric analysis included in PLS, were the differential form of a mass loss curve recorded during the analysis. In addition to examining the influence of submatrices or blocks to on the properties by sensitivity analysis, multi-block regression methods were applied. By application of multi-block methods, the part of the characteristics or the microstructure that influences the properties could be found directly from the regression analysis. Finally, the production conditions in a cement mill and a cement kiln were optimized to achieve optimal cement properties. Amount of water required to achieve standard consistency and setting time were predicted from production conditions in a cement mill, and potential compressive strength of clinker up to 28 days were predicted from production conditions in a cement <b>kiln.</b> The production <b>conditions</b> were optimized to achieve min and max values of the properties. The microstructure or the characteristics were predicted from the optimal production conditions to explain the influence of the production conditions on the properties mechanistically and chemically. The main contributions in the form of papers in this thesis are (the roman numerals refer to the list of papers at the end to this chapter) : 1. Developing methods for model-based optimization based on PLS, sensitivity analysis, prediction and linear programming. A case of demonstration was optimizing compressive strength of cement from variation of particle size distribution of cement [I-III] 2. Modelling compressive strength up to 28 days of cement on the characteristics of cement, predicting and optimizing potential compressive strength from the mineralogy of clinker [IV-V] 3. Presenting the principles and application of multi-block methods in cement production [VI-VII] 4. Optimizing production conditions to achieve optimal cement properties [VIII-IX] The use of multivariate data analysis, sensitivity analysis and model-based optimization is very useful in the design and manufacture of cement. The methods enabled tailoring of cement aiming at target values of properties like compressive strength, setting time and initial flow properties. The tailoring can be based on the variables representing the characteristics of cement as well as the variables representing the production conditions in the cement kiln and the cement mill. The max values of the compressive strength at 1 and 28 days were achieved by optimizing the production <b>conditions</b> in the <b>kiln</b> giving the optimal mineralogy for achieving max strengths.
