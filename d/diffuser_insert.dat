40|$|Background and Objective: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be {{used for}} {{ablation}} of high grade dysplasia and/or early cancer (HGD/T 1) in Barrett's esophagus. A complication of PDT is esophageal stricture. The objective {{of this study was to}} find the lowest light dose to potentially reduce the incidence of strictures while effectively ablating HGDITI. Materials and Methods: Patients (n= 1 13) with HGD/T 1 received an intravenous injection of porfimer sodium (2 mg/kg). Three days later, laser light (630 nm) was delivered using a cylindrical <b>diffuser</b> <b>inserted</b> in a 20 mm-diameter PDT balloon. Patients were treated at light doses of 1 1 5 J/cm, I 05 J/cm, 95 J/cm and 85 Jlcm. The efficacy was determined by four quadrant biopsies of the treated area three months after PDT. The formation of stricture was determined by the incidence of dysphagia and the need for esophageal dilation. Strictures were considered mild if they required less that 6 dilations, and severe if 6 or more dilations were required. Efficacy and incidence of strictures were tabulated as a funôtion of light dose. Results: Using I 15 J/cm, there were 17 % of patients with residual HGD/T 1 after one treatment. However, when the light doses of I 05 J/cm, 95 J/cm and 85 J/cm were used, the residual HGD/T 1 after one PDT session was increased to 33 %, 30 % and 32 %, respectively. The overall incidence of strictures (mild and severe) was not correlated to the light dose. However, the incidence of severe strictures was directly proportional to the light dose. Using the light dose of I I 5 J/cm, I 5. 3 % of patients developed severe strictures compared to about 5 % in the groups of patients who received the lower light doses. Conclusions: Decreasing the light dose below I I 5 J/cm doubled the rate of residual HGD/T 1 after one treatment while reducing the incidence of severe strictures to one-third of cases from I I 5 JIcm. The results {{may be used}} to evaluate the risks and benefits of different light doses...|$|R

40|$|Processing of {{dry film}} resist is an easy, low-cost, and fast way to {{fabricate}} microfluidic structures.

Here, we introduce a modification to the standard lithography process, {{in order to create}} rounded channels for microfluidic structures. Therefore, a <b>diffuser</b> element was <b>inserted</b> into in the optical path between the light source and glass substrate, which is then exposed through the backside, hence altering the exposure to the dry resist spatially.

40|$|International audienceAIM:Photodynamic therapy (PDT) {{appears to}} be a {{valuable}} new treatment modality for cancer therapy. Studies have reported successful application of PDT for glioblastoma. Here, we introduce a new device dedicated to intraoperative PDT delivered early after fluoro-guided resection combined with a transfer function that determines the treatment time based {{on the size of the}} surgical resection cavity. MATERIALS & METHODS:First, we describe the device, which is composed of a trocar, a balloon filled with a diffusing solution, and a fiber guide in which a cylindrical light <b>diffuser</b> is <b>inserted.</b> Ex vivo experiments were performed to measure the fluence rate inside biological tissues. A calibration factor was defined to convert power measurements into fluence rate values. Calf brains were used to simulate light propagation in human brain tissue, and the photosensitizer administration effect on optical properties was discussed. The temperature elevation during illumination was evaluated. RESULTS:Light power was measured in tissues surrounding the device during ex vivo experiments. Using the previously characterized calibration factor, power measurements were converted to fluence rate values to obtain the transfer function. No thermal elevation was observed during a 2 -h temperature test, and the impact of protoporphyrin IX on brain optical properties was considered negligible. CONCLUSION:A discussion of experimental precision is presented. The light duration determined by the abacus had a standard deviation of < 1 min. This value is weak compared with the total illumination time necessary to treat one patient. The main advantage of our device lies in its straightforward implementation of intraoperative PDT for neurosurgery with acceptable dosimetry and easy treatment time...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMixing {{ventilation}} {{is commonly}} used to control thermal comfort in a room {{by means of a}}ir jets. In summer conditions, the occupants often complain of thermal discomfort and draft problems, because the cooling airflow penetrates the occupied zone under buoyancy force effect, with high speeds and low temperatures. To reduce these problems, the jet trajectory could be maintained away from the occupant, by means of a radial jet attached to the ceiling. One great limitation of most radial ceiling diffusers is their inability to correctly mix the jet to the ambient air, {{and the use of the}} Coanda effect may worsen this issue because it reduces jet induction. The design of the diffuser itself to enhance the jet mixing with the ambient air by means of inserted lobes was recently proposed in an European patent. In this paper, an experimental investigation is made on airflow pattern and thermal comfort generated in a full scale model room by a ceiling diffuser, and its performance is compared with the same <b>diffuser</b> equipped with <b>inserted</b> lobes. The jet flow from the diffuser and its interaction with a heated manikin simulating an occupant were analyzed with the whole-field PIV technique. Thermal dissatisfaction and draft effect were analyzed based on traditional pointwise measuring probes and the standards ISO 7730 and ASHRAE 55. It is revealed that thermal discomfort and draft sensation were substantially reduced using inserted lobes, without significant changes of pressure drop and sound pressure levels. © 2016 Elsevier Lt...|$|R
