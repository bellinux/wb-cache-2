30|$|Single stress <b>fractures</b> {{may occur}} <b>in</b> cases {{where there are}} no predisposing factors, and Bron et al. [13] {{reported}} single stress <b>fractures</b> <b>in</b> three healthy patients. However, cases of multiple stress fractures with no predisposing factors are rare, and are even uncommon in the presence of predisposing factors. Multiple stress fractures have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in female patients with amenorrhea due to insufficient nutrition, excessive weight control, or excessive exercise. Cases of multiple stress fractures without such risk factors, include stress <b>fractures</b> <b>in</b> the cervical area of both femurs in a 19 -year-old male soldier reported by Romero et al.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{assess the}} {{clinical}} therapeutic effects of elasticintramedullarynail onextremityfractures in children. MethodsFrom June 2005 to March 2008, 40 children with extremity fractures were treated by elastic intramedullary nail, in whom femoral shaft <b>fractures</b> occurred <b>in</b> 26 cases, tibiofibular <b>fractures</b> <b>in</b> 8 cases, radial capitular <b>fractures</b> <b>in</b> 4 cases, ulnoradial <b>fractures</b> <b>in</b> 2 cases. All patients were treated by closed reduction and elastic intramedullary nailfixation. ResultsAll the fractures gained satisfactory reduction and healing. The average duration needed for fracture healing was 1 - 2 months. Postoperative follow-up confirmed a sound functional recovery. ConclusionsThe elastic intramedullary nail is a minimally invasive and effective surgical approach {{for treatment of}} extremity <b>fractures</b> <b>in</b> children. It allows early functional exercises after operation and secures a satisfactory bone union and functional recovery...|$|R

5|$|A 1993 study {{proposed}} that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was {{not the result of}} hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. Compared to modern wolves, the high frequency of tooth <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> Beringian wolves indicates higher carcass consumption due to higher carnivore density and increased competition.|$|E

5|$|A {{reduction}} in fracture toughness {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a {{reduction in}} temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in fracture toughness is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Comparing the {{epidemiology}} of <b>fractures</b> originating <b>in</b> the cervical and apical regions {{may help}} to understand the causes and risk of a vertical root fracture. We aimed to determine the frequency of vertical root <b>fractures</b> <b>in</b> different <b>fracture</b> sites and how the fracture site relates to fracture direction and post length. Methods: Teeth diagnosed with a vertical root fracture were retrospectively surveyed for age and sex of the patient, type of tooth, a <b>fracture</b> region <b>in</b> the longitudinal axial direction, site of the fracture, and presence of a post The <b>fracture</b> region <b>in</b> the longitudinal axial direction was classified as an incomplete fracture, complete fracture, and uncertain. Incomplete fractures were further classified into a <b>fracture</b> originating <b>in</b> the cervical region, a <b>fracture</b> originating <b>in</b> the midregion, and a <b>fracture</b> originating <b>in</b> the apical region. Posts were evaluated by loss of post and length of post. Results: <b>Fractures</b> originating <b>in</b> the cervical and apical region occurred around the same frequency, whereas <b>fractures</b> originating <b>in</b> the midregion were extremely scarce. Of the <b>fractures</b> originating <b>in</b> the cervical region, 36. 2 % were in a mesial and/or distal site and 57. 4 % in a buccal and/or lingual site. Of the <b>fractures</b> originating <b>in</b> the apical region, 90. 8 % were in the buccal and/ or lingual site. The {{number of cases of}} <b>fractures</b> Originating <b>in</b> the apical region decreased with increased post length. Conclusions: Sites of fracture and post length differed greatly between <b>fractures</b> originating <b>in</b> the cervical region and the apical region, suggesting that risk factors for <b>fractures</b> originating <b>in</b> the cervical and apical regions are different...|$|R

5|$|As {{a sophomore}} {{in the fall}} of 1995, he was moved up to the varsity {{basketball}} team from the junior varsity due to injuries. As a junior, his presence was significant enough that one opposing team practiced with a coach holding a broom in the air to simulate playing against him. He helped his team reach the Class 4A-state Region II final. As a junior in baseball, Young threw a no-hitter against McKinney High School in Spring 1997. However, he missed {{a large part of the}} season after getting off to a 6–0 start because of a stress <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> his foot. Nonetheless, he was already considered a top professional prospect, and he was named as one of seven Highland Park players on the all-district team. By the summer of 1997, he was able to play for the Dallas Mustangs who were the defending national champions in the Connie Mack World Series, and he earned the win in the fifth place game of the World Series.|$|E
