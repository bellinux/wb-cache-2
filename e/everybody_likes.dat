I think on the whole people in the other American Republics understand and support us, but it isn't good politics to say so at {{election time}}. We are a sort of punching bag during elections. <b>Everybody</b> <b>likes</b> to take a swing at us, and makes sure he does every time you say something.|$|E

500|$|Game Show Network (GSN) {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} air Press Your Luck in September 2001, and high viewership ratings prompted the network to order {{a revival of the}} series. Two pilots were taped on February 13, 2002: one with original Press Your Luck host Peter Tomarken and the other hosted by Todd Newton. Newton was ultimately chosen to host the show. Tomarken explained that he was asked to change his style of hosting, saying, [...] "It was terribly hurtful and I think I was doomed before I did [...] I remember being told, 'No, no. Be nice. Be sure <b>everybody</b> <b>likes</b> you.' I took that advice with the pilot. I made the same mistake." [...] Tomarken also acknowledged that GSN wanted to employ a younger host in an effort to attract a younger audience.|$|E

500|$|In 1956, Truman {{traveled}} to Europe with his wife. In England, {{he met with}} Churchill and received an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree from Oxford University. Across Britain he was hailed; London's [...] Daily Telegraph characterized Truman as the [...] "Living and kicking symbol of everything that <b>everybody</b> <b>likes</b> best about the United States." [...] In 1959, {{he was given a}} 50-year award by the Masons, recognizing his longstanding involvement: he was initiated on February 9, 1909, into the Belton Masonic Lodge in Missouri. In 1911, he helped establish the Grandview Lodge, and he served as its first Worshipful Master. [...] In September 1940, during his Senate re-election campaign, Truman was elected Grand Master of the Missouri Grand Lodge of Freemasonry; Truman said later that the Masonic election assured his victory in the general election. In 1945, he was made a 33° Sovereign Grand Inspector General and an Honorary Member of the supreme council at the Supreme Council A.A.S.R. Southern Jurisdiction Headquarters in Washington D.C. [...] Truman was also a member of Sons of the American Revolution (SAR) and a card-carrying member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Two of his relatives were Confederate soldiers.|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} to improve ratings, [...] "Jack-Tor" [...] was the first episode of 30 Rock to air on a Thursday night, which is advertised by NBC as [...] "Comedy Night Done Right". 30 Rock {{was also one of}} several sitcoms to have a [...] "super-sized" [...] episode, which NBC {{employed}} as a sweeps stunt, and to initiate a mostly comedy lineup. Instead of the usual 30-minute episodes, [...] "Jack-Tor" [...] was increased to 40 minutes. Despite the increased length of the episode, Jack McBrayer, who plays Kenneth Parcell, received credits but did not appear in the show, except for a brief non-speaking cameo at the very end when Jenna is singing [...] "Muffin Top". Fey said that there was [...] "such a big ensemble" [...] in the episode that he was crowded out. Fey said that she thought [...] "McBrayer is fantastic", and that she is [...] "planning to use him lots and lots". Executive producer Lorne Michaels also praised McBrayer, saying [...] "we're very high on him. He's obviously the breakout performer on the series. We like him, the network likes him, viewers like him, <b>everybody</b> <b>likes</b> him." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{widespread}} arrival of sound film in American theaters in 1929, many independent exhibitors began dropping the then-dominant presentation model, which involved live acts {{and a broad}} variety of shorts before a single featured film. A new programming scheme developed that would soon become standard practice: a newsreel, a short and/or a serial, and a cartoon, followed by a double feature. The second feature, which actually screened before the main event, cost the exhibitor less per minute than the equivalent running time in shorts. The majors' comprehensive booking policy, which would {{become known as the}} run-zone-clearance system, inadvertently pushed independent theaters toward adopting the double-feature format. As described by historian Thomas Schatz, the system [...] "sent a picture, after playing in the lucrative first-run arena, through the 16,000 'subsequent-run' movie houses; 'clearance' refers to the amount of time between runs, and 'zone' refers to the specific areas in which a film played. Typically, a top feature would play in its second run in smaller downtown theaters [...] and then move steadily outward from the urban centers to the suburbs, then to smaller cities and towns, and finally to rural communities, playing in ever smaller (and less profitable) venues and taking upwards of six months to complete its run." [...] The [...] "clearance" [...] policy prevented independent exhibitors' timely access to top-quality films as a matter of course; the second feature allowed them to promote quantity instead. The bottom-billed movie also gave the program [...] "balance"—the practice of pairing different sorts of features suggested to potential customers that they could count on something of interest no matter what specifically was on the bill. As the president of one Poverty Row company would later put it, [...] "Not <b>everybody</b> <b>likes</b> to eat cake. Some people like bread, and even a certain number of people like stale bread rather than fresh bread." [...] The low-budget picture of the 1920s naturally transformed into the second feature, the B movie, of the 1930s and 1940s—the most reliable bread of Hollywood's Golden Age.|$|E
