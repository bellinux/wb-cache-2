5|$|Due to lost {{communications}} with Battalion and then Regimental headquarters, and the unit's subsequent capture, its disposition and success at delaying {{the advance of}} the 6th Panzer Army that day was unknown to U.S. commanders. Lt. Lyle Bouck considered the wounding of most of his men and the capture of his entire unit a failure. When the war ended five months later, the platoon's men, who were split between two prisoner-of-war camps, <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> home. It was only after the war that Bouck learned that his platoon had prevented the lead German infantry elements from advancing and had delayed by about 20 hours their armored units' advance. On October 26, 1981, after considerable lobbying, a Congressional hearing, and letter-writing by Bouck, {{every member of the}} unit were finally recognized for their valor that day, making the platoon most decorated American unit of its size of World War II.|$|E

I ultimately did go out with him and the song was finished just before my last date with him, which I'm kinda happy that it did not continue... The dance floor was quite a magical place for me. I started off wanting to be a dancer, so that had a lot to do with the song. The freedom that I always feel when I'm dancing, that feeling of inhabiting your body, letting yourself go, expressing yourself through music. I always thought of it as a magical place– even if you're not taking ecstasy. Hence that came to me as the primary inspiration for 'Into the Groove'." ...|$|E

500|$|... 2003 {{marked a}} {{significant}} {{turning point in}} Sarsgaard's career, when he starred in the feature film Shattered Glass. He depicted journalist Charles Lane, the lead editor of The New Republic. Shattered Glass {{is based on the}} real events of journalist Stephen Glass' career at The New Republic during the mid-1990s and his fall when his widespread journalistic fraud is exposed. During promotion of the film, Sarsgaard noted of his portrayal of Lane: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his perspective on the actual events. [...] I think that I tried to have some respect for myself and that way you're respecting the real person you're playing. I've done it a number of times. And it's always a little bit confusing. The {{best thing to do is}} just to ignore the fact, I think, that you're playing somebody who is a real life character." [...] According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "Peter Sarsgaard is appealingly level, a stolid straight-shooter as Lane". A reviewer from the Chicago Tribune noted that Sarsgaard plays Lane with [...] "great subtlety and grace". The newspaper concluded with, [...] "The character doesn't seethe with personal resentment; when he does a slow burn, he conveys a much deeper sense of a man's value system being violated past the breaking point." [...] Sarsgaard's performance in the film earned him his first Golden Globe Award nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.|$|E
