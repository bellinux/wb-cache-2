60|$|The Adolf Scherer of that day--though {{it is not}} so {{long ago}} as time flies--was even more solid and {{impressive}} than the man he afterwards became, when he reached the dizzier heights from which he delivered to an eager press opinions on politics and war, eugenics and woman's suffrage and other subjects that are the despair of specialists. Had he stuck to steel, he would have remained invulnerable. But even then he was beginning to abandon the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> for that of exploitation: figuratively speaking, he had taken to soap, which with the aid of water may be blown into beautiful, iridescent bubbles to charm the eye. Much good soap, apparently, has gone that way, never to be recovered. Everybody who was anybody began to blow bubbles about that time, and the bigger the bubble the greater its attraction for investors of hard-earned savings. Outside of this love for financial iridescence, let it be called, Mr. Scherer seemed to care little then for glitter of any sort. Shortly after his elevation to the presidency of the Boyne Iron Works he had been elected a member of the Boyne Club,--an honour of which, some thought, he should have been more sensible; but generally, when in town, he preferred to lunch at a little German restaurant annexed to a saloon, where I used often to find him literally towering above the cloth,--for he was a giant with short legs,--his napkin tucked into his shirt front, engaged in lively conversation with the ministering Heinrich. The chef at the club, Mr. Scherer insisted, could produce nothing equal to Heinrich's sauer-kraut and sausage. My earliest relationship with Mr. Scherer was that of an errand boy, of bringing to him for his approval papers which might not be intrusted to a common messenger. His gruffness and brevity disturbed me more than I cared to confess. I was pretty sure that he eyed me with the disposition of the self-made to believe that college educations and good tailors were the heaviest handicaps with which a young man could be burdened: and I suspected him of an inimical attitude toward the older families of the city. Certain men possessed his confidence; and he had built, as it were, a stockade about them, sternly keeping {{the rest of the world}} outside. In Theodore Watling he had a childlike faith.|$|E

40|$|The {{author of}} the article {{analyzes}} the spheres of film, independent cinema, new models <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and distribution, and new technology. The author puts particular emphasis on studying the socalled principles of the reverse economy. The term ‘reverse economy’ has originated from Pierre Bourdieu’s sociological concept <b>of</b> <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> cultural <b>production.</b> It signifies the inversely proportional principle of culture management: according to this rule, investing relatively little real capital generates a large capital of symbolic value. The main difference between <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> cultural <b>production</b> and any kind <b>of</b> economically-oriented <b>field</b> {{is based on the}} fact, that symbolic capital is – as opposed to the ‘real’ one – financially incalculable. In the <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> cultural <b>production</b> the greatest importance is attached to experimental and innovative projects designed to disturb the cultural status quo, whose constitution is always a fatal threat to culture itself. The article also proves that low budgets lead to the creation <b>of</b> new <b>production</b> models, and their influence on the autonomy of creativity in film...|$|R
