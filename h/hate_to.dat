25|$|Following {{operations}} in {{observation of the}} Elbe and the relief of a POW camp containing around 100 Belgians the regiment entered Hamburg after the surrender of that city. The condition {{of the city and}} its people made him feel very uncomfortable and his feelings towards the German populace mellowed from that of <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> that of pity. After VE Day he was able to work alongside the Catholic relief agency CCRA based at Greven near Münster, helping displaced persons.|$|E

25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E
25|$|Latif's team next {{assignment}} was the ICC Intercontinental Cup and Afghanistan play Scotland in the final. Latif stated that Afghanistan {{likes to play}} aggressive cricket and that the players are mentally very tough and <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> lose. On 2 December the match against Scotland started and because of Hamid Hassan Scotland were bowled out for 212. More than half of Scotland's runs came from Neil McCallum who scored 104*. Afghanistan {{got off to a}} good start but collapsed to 171 all out, giving Scotland a 41-run lead. Despite this another great bowling performance from Hassan and Samiullah Shenwari meant that Scotland were skittled for just 82 in their second innings. On the third day Afghanistan sealed victory early in the day with seven-wickets in hand courtesy of a superb 56* by Mohammad Shahzad.|$|E
