This thesis investigates several of the outstanding questions regarding the mechanisms of melt transport {{and its effects on}} the shallow mantle. Chapter 1 details the current understanding of melt migration from observations at mid-ocean ridges and ophiolites. Chapter 2 uses the size distribution and abundance of <b>dunites</b> measured in the Oman ophiolite to place limits on the potential mechanisms by which <b>dunites</b> form and subsequently estimate the flux of chemically unequilibrated melt which a network of <b>dunites</b> can supply. Chapter 3 characterizes the chemical composition of <b>dunites</b> and harzburgites from Oman to further constrain the process by which <b>dunites</b> form and relates the observed trends within <b>dunites</b> to variations in the time-integrated melt/rock ratio. Chapter 4 examines the microstructures of peridotites in Oman to constrain the deformation mechanisms which determine the viscosity of shallow mantle. Chapter 5 is a numerical investigation of advection beneath ridges incorporating the rheology inferred from the observed microstructures. Chapter 6 integrates the conclusions of the previous chapters, reevaluating the potential melt flux through <b>dunites</b> and constraining the permeability of the shallow mantle. by Michael Geoffrey Braun.

The main rock-forming minerals in ultramafic cumulates are cumulus olivine associated with various inter-cumulus minerals, as well as chromian spinel occurring as both cumulus and inter-cumulus phase. Mg#, FeO/MgO ratios and TiO 2, Al 2 O 3 concentrations in parental melts were calculated from olivine and spinel compositions. The inferred parental melt compositions indicate that the dunite-troctolite layered series at the mantle tectonite-ultramafic cumulate transition zone in the WMO was derived from a normal-type mid-ocean ridge basaltic (N-MORB) parental melt. In contrast, the dunite-troctolite layered series {{from the top of}} the WMO ultramafic cumulitic sequence was derived from a medium-Ti basaltic (MTB) parental melt originated, in turn, in a nascent forearc setting. The inferred composition of parental melts indicate that chromitiferous <b>dunites,</b> <b>dunites,</b> and lherzolites from the EMO were originated from primary boninitic melts, whereas olivine-websterites were originated from slightly fractionated boninitic liquids. The inferred parental melt compositions plagioclasebearing <b>dunites</b> and lherzolites, as well as troctolites from the EMO are compatible with an N-MORB type parentage, being the only exception one plagioclasedunite, which may have derived from a low-Ti tholeiitic melt. Comparison of the ultramafic cumulates from the WMO and EMO indicates that both these units, though to a different extent, have experienced similar and coeval magmatic events. The investigated WMO ultramafic cumulates record N-MORB and MTB magmatic episodes. The investigated EMO ultramafic cumulates testify for boninitic, N-MORB, and very subordinate low-Ti tholeiitic magmatic events.

We have studied a suite of 16 ultramafic samples representative of different degrees of partial melting and magma-rock interaction among which the protogranular harzburgites are the least metasomatised xenoliths and <b>dunites</b> are the ultimate stage of metasomatism. Olivine LPO is characterized by high concentration of [010] axes perpendicular to the foliation and [100] axes close to the lineation or distributed in the foliation plane in harzburgites, whereas the high concentration of [100] axes is parallel to the lineation and [010] axes is perpendicular to the assumed foliation in <b>dunites.</b> Olivine LPO in harzburgites is interpreted as being due to a deformation regime in axial compression or transpression.

40|$|The {{influence}} of pyroxene on upper mantle viscosity remains unclear but may occur either through its difference in strength relative to olivine or through {{its effect on}} olivine microstructure. To determine the role of pyroxene in moderating peridotite viscosity, we analyzed microstructures in paired harzburgites and <b>dunites</b> from a natural shear zone exposed in the Josephine Peridotite. Olivine crystallographic textures evolve similarly in harzburgites and <b>dunites</b> with increasing strain, indicating the operation of similar deformation mechanisms in olivine. The mean olivine grain sizes are ~ 1. 5 times larger in <b>dunites</b> than in harzburgites, whereas the mean olivine subgrain sizes are a factor of ~ 1. 2 smaller in <b>dunites</b> than in harzburgites. The average stresses in olivine, estimated with a subgrain-size piezometer, are inverselycorrelated with pyroxene volume fraction and directly correlated with the mean olivine grain size. The calculated ratio of pyroxene viscosity to olivine viscosity for each harzburgite/dunite pair varies from 1. 2 to 3. 3. Notably, our data indicate thatolivine viscosity is non-Newtonian with afinite grain-size sensitivity. We suggest that at {{the conditions of the}} shear zone, pyroxene is more viscous than olivine but that the increase in aggregate strength with larger pyroxene fractions isoffset by correspondingly smaller olivine grain sizes. Thus, major rheological weakening associated with pyroxene content may only be possible if (1) temperatures are higher than those characterizing this shear zone, increasing the viscosity contrast between olivine and pyroxene or (2) stresses are high enough that grain-size reduction promotes a transition to a deformation mechanism with extreme grain-size sensitivity, such as diffusion creep...|$|R
