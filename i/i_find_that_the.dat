Hulme frequently passed-on complaints of bias in TDT's coverage from Holt's government in Canberra, each of which Madgwick dutifully investigated.

[...] The author does not conceal her dislike for some much-used herbs: sage [...] "deadens the food with its musty dried blood scent" [...] and rosemary [...] "acrid taste … the spiky little leaves get stuck between your teeth." ...|$|E
500|$|Ballistic {{evidence}} indicates that the 10-member gang took at least six guns {{with them on the}} attack. An independent panel of inquiry commissioned by the Pat Finucane Centre has established that among the weapons actually used in the killings were two Sterling 9mm submachine guns and a 9mm Luger pistol serial no. U 4. The submachine guns, which had been stolen years earlier from {{a former member of the}} B Specials, were linked to prior and later sectarian killings, whereas the Luger had been used to kill leading IRA member, John Francis Green, the previous January. In a letter to the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Bombing of Kay's Tavern dated 22 February 2004, the Northern Ireland Office stated that: [...] "The PSNI [...] have confirmed that a 9mm Luger pistol was ballistically traced both to the murder of John Francis Green and to the Miami Showband murders." [...] In May 1976, Robin Jackson's fingerprints were discovered on the metal barrel of a home-made silencer constructed for a Luger. Both the silencer and pistol– which was later established to have been the same one used in the Miami Showband killings– were found by the security forces at the home of Edward Sinclair. Jackson was charged with possession of the silencer but not convicted, the trial judge having reportedly said: [...] "At the end of the day <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> accused somehow touched the silencer, but the Crown evidence has left me completely in the dark as to whether he did that wittingly or unwittingly, willingly or unwillingly". The Luger was destroyed by the RUC on 28 August 1978.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2000, the FFRF brought suit, as {{taxpayers in}} the state of Wisconsin, against Faith Works located in Milwaukee. Their case stated that a faith-based addiction-{{treatment}} program should not be used as a court ordered treatment program using taxpayer funds. In January 2002 the ruling was decided in the FFRF's favor; that receiving {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} in public money is in violation of the Establishment Clause. The judge wrote [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Department of Workforce Development's grant to Faith Works constitutes unrestricted, direct funding of an organization that engages in religious indoctrination, I conclude that this funding stream violates the establishment clause." [...] On Appeal, in April 2003, The Seventh Circuit later ruled against the FFRF on the narrower issue of whether prisoners joining specific faith-based programs on their own free will are coerced by government endorsement of religion.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson had {{allegedly}} {{been using}} the tape whilst lapping hoses for beer kegs at the bar. In his statement to Detective Superintendent Drew, Jackson claimed that one week prior to his arrest, two high-ranking RUC officers had tipped him off about his fingerprints having been found on the insulating tape wrapped around the silencer used with the Luger. Jackson {{went on to say}} that he was forewarned, using the words: [...] "I should clear as there was a wee job up the country that I would be done for and there was no way out of it for me". On 2 June, Jackson was charged with possession of a firearm, a magazine, four rounds of ammunition and a silencer with intent to endanger life. He was detained in custody and went to trial on 11 November 1976 at a Diplock Court held at Belfast City Commission, charged only with possession of the silencer. Although the judge initially rejected his defence that his fingerprints were on the insulating tape and had [...] "been innocently transferred to the silencer", he managed to avoid conviction when he was acquitted of the charge. The trial judge, Mr Justice Murray, had said: [...] "At the end of the day <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> accused somehow touched the silencer, but the Crown evidence has left me completely in the dark as to whether he did that wittingly or unwittingly, willingly or unwillingly".|$|E
