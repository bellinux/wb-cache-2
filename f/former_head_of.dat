5|$|Going Clear {{is based}} closely on Lawrence Wright's book, {{covering}} {{much of the}} same ground with the aid of archive footage, dramatic reconstructions, and interviews with eight former Scientologists: Paul Haggis, the Oscar-winning director; Mark Rathbun, the church's former second-in-command; Mike Rinder, the <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the church's Office of Special Affairs; the actor Jason Beghe; Sylvia 'Spanky' Taylor, former liaison to John Travolta; and former Scientologists Tom DeVocht, Sara Goldberg, and Hana Eltringham Whitfield.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Bédel Bokassa {{served as}} a de facto head of state (and also reigned as Emperor from 1976–1979), while David Dacko (who served as de facto head of state from 1979–1981), André Kolingba, Ange-Félix Patassé, and François Bozizé were elected into office {{at some point during}} their tenure. To date, Kolingba is the only <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> state of the Central African Republic to voluntarily step down from the office through a {{democratic}} process, following the 1993 general election.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1971, he was {{appointed}} {{as the head of}} the Press and Public Relations of Mexico City alongside Alfonso Martínez Domínguez. However, Buendía turned down the position in June following the massacre of student demonstrators. A year later, Buendía worked as an advisor to Guillermo Martínez Domínguez, the <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> Nacional Financiera, a bank of Mexico's Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP). In Nacional Financiera, Buendía befriended Gerardo Bueno Zirón, who shortly after being appointed as director of the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) offered him a position as director of the institution's Press and Public Relations department in 1973. That year, Henrique González Casanova, the <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the Political Science department at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), invited Buendía to work as a part-time professor, a job that the journalist held until his death in 1984.|$|E

5|$|Protests {{were not}} as large on 27 January while {{preparations}} were made for planned large-scale events {{on the following day}} (Friday). The Muslim Brotherhood declared its full support of the protests, and members planned to take part during Friday's demonstrations.

5|$|Subsequently, three others, Julián Sancristóbal, Juan Alberto Perote and Francisco Álvarez, were {{implicated in}} the case. Sancristóbal had been the former {{director}} of state security, Perote the <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish secret service, while Álvarez had been head of the anti-terrorist squad. They all denied the accusations. The Monbar case was closed in October 2001, with Garzón declaring that, although suspicions remained about involvement of some of those accused, there was insufficient evidence to prosecute.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{served as}} a member of the Advisory Council of Transparency International.

5|$|A {{proposal}} {{was made to}} call a special session to repeal the law, and Bradley {{was in favor of}} the action, but a poll of the legislators showed that too many of them were noncommittal to justify the call. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals found it constitutional. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked the members of the Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats – W. S. Pryor, former chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; W. T. Ellis, former U. S. Representative from Daviess County; and C. B. Poyntz, <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the state railroad commission.|$|E
5|$|After {{relative}} stability {{at the senior}} executive level for three decades, there has been significant turnover in the positions since the 1990s. The team had eight general managers in eight years, for example, between 1996 and 2003. The current GM is Jim Popp who was appointed {{at the end of}} 207 February 2017. Chris Rudge, <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the Canadian Olympic Committee, took over as president and CEO from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2015, when Michael Copeland took over.|$|E
5|$|Fleming became {{interested}} in diamond smuggling after reading an article in The Sunday Times in 1954 concerning the Sierra Leone diamond industry. Philip Brownrigg, an old friend from Eton and a senior exec of De Beers, arranged for Fleming to visit the London Diamond Club to see diamonds being sorted and polished. In 1955 Brownrigg also introduced Fleming to Sir Percy Sillitoe, <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> MI5, who was working for De Beers and investigating the illicit diamond trade through the International Diamond Security Organisation. Fleming met Sillitoe and used {{much of the research}} as background material for his fictional Bond novel, Diamonds Are Forever.|$|E

5|$|Following World War II, Cy Feuer and Ernie Martin started {{producing}} musicals together.

Having secured {{the rights to}} the farce Charley's Aunt, they produced it as the musical comedy Where's Charley?, with a score by Frank Loesser. Among the backers of Where's Charley? were Rodgers and Hammerstein, which helped secure additional investment. The show was a hit and helped establish Feuer and Martin on Broadway—they would go on to produce Guys and Dolls.|$|E
5|$|Jadid {{appointed}} Nureddin al-Atassi as President, Regional Secretary of the Regional Command and Secretary General of the National Command, Yusuf Zu'ayyin became Prime Minister again, and Ibrahim Makhus {{was appointed}} Minister of Foreign Affairs.

5|$|Meanwhile, Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen), <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> Project Alice and {{the head}} of the North American Umbrella facility, {{operated}} in Nevada, considers Alice's recapture to be a top priority, since she has the ability to bond with the T-virus and not suffer mutation. He tries to persuade the Umbrella board, operating via holograms from the worldwide Umbrella facility, that he can use her blood to develop a permanent cure as well as tame the infected zombies. The new Umbrella chairman Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara) orders Isaacs to use the clones to create a cure, and he refuses to authorize Alice's recapture until they are informed of her location.|$|E

5|$|The Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) was a United States {{military}} agency {{responsible for}} those aspects of nuclear weapons remaining under military control after the Manhattan Project was succeeded by the Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947. These responsibilities included the maintenance, storage, surveillance, security and handling of nuclear weapons, as well as supporting nuclear testing. The AFSWP was a joint organization, staffed by the United States Army, United States Navy and United States Air Force; its chief was supported by deputies from the other two services. Major General Leslie R. Groves, the <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the Manhattan Project, was its first chief.|$|E
5|$|FairTax proponents {{argue that}} the {{proposal}} would provide tax burden visibility and reduce compliance and efficiency costs by 90%, returning {{a large share of}} money to the productive economy. The Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system. Bill Archer, <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the House Ways and Means Committee, asked Princeton University Econometrics to survey 500 European and Asian companies regarding the effect on their business decisions if the United States enacted the FairTax. 400 of those companies stated they would build their next plant in the United States, and 100 companies said they would move their corporate headquarters to the United States. Supporters {{argue that the}} U.S. has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among OECD countries along with being the only country with no border adjustment element in its tax system. Proponents state that because the FairTax eliminates corporate income taxes and is automatically border adjustable, the competitive tax advantage of foreign producers would be eliminated, immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home.|$|E
