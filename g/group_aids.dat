5000|$|The DGSS is {{the oldest}} non-medical sexological society {{existing}} in German-language Europe (i. e., Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and parts of Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium, France, and Italy). Its governing and international advisory boards have included many noted scholars, among them Rüdiger Lautmann, John Money, Gisela Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg, John Gagnon, Igor S. Kon http://www.neuro.net.ru/sexology/english/, Liu Dalin, and Martin S. Weinberg http://www.indiana.edu/~soc/zbio_Weinberg.shtml. Presidents were Rolf Gindorf (1971-1979, Vice Pres. -2004, now Hon. Pres.), Helmut Kentler (1979-1982), Ernest Borneman (1982-1986, now Hon. Pres.), Erwin J. Haeberle (1986-2002), Gunter Runkel (2002-2006) http://www.sexologie.org/runkel.htm, and Jakob Pastoetter http://www.sexologie.org/topf/jmp.htm (2006-). From the very beginning, the DGSS has {{emphasized the importance of}} the social, behavioral, and cultural sciences for an adequate understanding of the human sexualities in their many forms, facets, and variations. In addition to traditional sexological fields like biology, physiology, and medicine, the DGSS focus has centered on the social sciences, psychology, and ethnology, embracing also educational, legal, and historical aspects. In 1978, the DGSS added a pioneering counselling institute ("DGSS-Institut") to its scientific and research activities. Since then, more than 33,000 clients received sexual counselling or psychotherapy. Gay, lesbian and bisexual people form a considerable <b>group.</b> <b>AIDS</b> counseling and HIV antibody testing has been provided since 1983. Under difficult circumstances, with habitually low financial resources and extremely modest outside support, the DGSS has nevertheless managed to hold increasingly successful national and international sexological congresses, establishing a close cooperation with most German and many foreign sexological societies. An impressive number of scientific publications, including many books and a book series ("Schriftenreihe Sozialwissenschaftliche Sexualforschung", Berlin/New York: W. de Gruyter, since 1986; Münster/Hamburg/London: LIT Verlag, since 2003) give a fairly adequate impression of sexological research by the DGSS and its members.|$|E

40|$|Why do {{millions}} of {{consumers in the}} United States struggling {{with the consequences of}} overconsumption believe that membership in a support group is crucial to their well-being? We examine how Weight Watchers, the world's largest support <b>group,</b> <b>aids</b> its members' attempts at managing their overweight condition. This article advances the view that in the United States, support groups that are organized around issues of overconsumption, such as Weight Watchers, resonate with members' quest for well-being in light of the spiritual-therapeutic model. The spiritual-therapeutic model denotes the understanding of well-being inscribed within the contemporary American cultural milieu. We find that among Weight Watchers members in the United States, the support group acts as a venue for angst-alleviating therapeutic confession, fosters the enactment of the support group as a benevolent system of therapeutic oversight, and facilitates a revitalizing practice of autotherapeutic testimonial.

40|$|This {{paper will}} provide a {{comprehensive}} analysis of the social movement headed by the <b>group</b> <b>AIDS</b> Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT-UP).

In my paper I will explain the material conditions that prompted the formation of ACT-UP, the use of artwork and direct action demonstrations to build consciousness in the gay community, and the negative effects of narrowing political consciousness. I will also discuss the impact of socio-economic and gay identity on the tactics of ACT-UP. Lastly, I will discuss the successes and failures of ACT-UP's primary objectives. In my paper, I am arguing that although ACT-UP successfully materialized their goals relating to AIDS treatment, research, and education, the movement dissolved in 1993 because of the organization's narrowed political consciousness and narrowed collective identity...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} impact of AIDS on {{premature}} mortality {{in the city of}} Amsterdam (1982 - 1992). METHODS: We combined aggregated data from the Netherlands Central Bureau for Statistics with data from the municipal death and population registry and data from the Amsterdam AIDS surveillance system to calculate age standardized mortality rates for men aged 15 - 64 years and 25 - 54 years and working years of potential life lost before 65 years (WYPLL). RESULTS: AIDS was {{the leading cause of death}} for men aged 25 - 54 years in Amsterdam from 1990 onwards, and the third leading cause of death for men aged 15 - 64 years in 1991. In this larger age <b>group</b> <b>AIDS</b> will probably become the leading cause of death in the coming years. In 1991, AIDS was already the leading cause of WYPLL before 65 years for men in the 15 - 64 age group. Without AIDS, there would have been a decrease in premature WYPLL from 1982 onwards; however, because of AIDS the number of WYPLL is increasing again. CONCLUSION: AIDS has had a significant impact on the pattern of premature mortality in Amsterdam in the period 1982 - 1992. Its impact will probably increase over the next few year...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cytological {{reports of}} ameloblastoma are {{relatively}} {{rare in the}} literature. Appropriate cytologic diagnosis may {{play a significant role}} in its preoperative presumptive diagnosis, especially when incisional biopsy findings are inadequate. Aim: To systematically study the detailed cytomorphologic features of ameloblastoma and to evaluate the role of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in its preoperative diagnosis. Materials and Methods: In this study, FNAC was done on 26 cases of intra-osseous jaw lesion, clinically diagnosed as odontogenic tumor or developmental odontogenic cysts and detailed cytopathological interpretation was carried out and the results were correlated with the corresponding histopathology. Results: Of the 26 cases, 15 were found to be ameloblastoma and sensitivity of FNAC in the diagnosis of ameloblastoma was found to be 86. 6 %. None of the intra-osseous jaw lesion was false positively diagnosed as ameloblastoma in FNAC and hence the specificity was found to be 100 %. Conclusion: Presence of cohesive epithelial cell clusters exhibiting smaller basaloid cells with peripherally placed tall columnar cells and occasional large squamous cells either adjoining the basaloid epithelial clusters or in isolated <b>group</b> <b>aids</b> in the specific cytological diagnosis of ameloblastoma and FNAC offers an excellent diagnostic aid that may {{play a significant role in}} preoperative presumptive diagnosis of ameloblastoma along with incisional biopsy...|$|E
40|$|Objective : {{to examine}} changes in {{mortality}} in rural South Africa {{over the period}} 1992 - 1995 by age, sex and cause of death. Design : as with much of sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa lacks effective vital registration and information on mortality is lacking. The Agincourt demographic and health surveillance system was established to inform health policy and practice with regard to rural subdistrict populations. Methods : prospective community-based study involving annual update of a household census with enquiry into all birth, death and migration events. All reported deaths (n = 1001) {{are the subject of}} a verbal autopsy. Results : an increasing trend in overall mortality relative to general population growth in the study area is apparent. There is evidence for a reversal in the previously declining trend in mortality among women 20 - 44 years. A comparison of 1992 - 1993 with 1994 - 1995 shows that most of the increase in mortality is concentrated in the younger adult (20 - 49 year) age <b>group.</b> <b>AIDS</b> and related diseases, particularly tuberculosis, appear primarily responsible. Injuries and violence (especially homicide) and circulatory disease are important, under-recognized causes of death, although their levels have remained constant over the period. Conclusions : mortality from AIDS and related diseases appears responsible for the probable reversal in mortality emerging in South Africa's rural northeast. Findings carry implications for the emerging system of decentralized health care. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{asynchronous}} {{discussion forum}} {{is one of}} the most widely used activities in learning management system environment. Online forum allows participants to interact, construct knowledge, and can be used to complement face to face sessions in blended learning courses. However, to what extent do the students perceive the benefits or advantages of forum remain to be seen. Through content and social network analyses, instructors will be able to gauge the students ’ engagement and knowledge construction level. Thus, this study aims to analyze the students ’ level of knowledge construction and their participation level that occur through online discussion. It also attempts to investigate the relationship between the level of knowledge construction and their social interaction patterns. The sample involves 23 students undertaking a master course in one public university in Malaysia. The asynchronous discussion forum was conducted for three weeks as part of the course requirement. The finding indicates that the level of knowledge construction is quite low. Also, the density value of 0. 11 indicating the overall communication among the participants in the forum is low. This study reveals that strong and significant correlations between SNA measures (in-degree centrality, out-degree centrality) and level of knowledge construction. Thus, allocating these active students in different <b>group</b> <b>aids</b> the interactive discussion takes place. Finally, based upon the findings, some recommendations to increase students’ level of knowledge construction and also for further research are proposed...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the fundus findings of patients infected with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) in correlation to Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) and CD 4 count. METHODS: Two hundred and two patients {{of the three major}} races (Chinese, Malay and Indian) in Malaysia were recruited in this population-based cross-sectional study. This consisted of confirmed HIV sero-positive patients with HAART treatment (n= 95) or without HAART therapy (n= 107) from December 2007 to March 2008. They were further classified into the HIV infected <b>group,</b> <b>AIDS</b> related complex (ARC) group and AIDS group. Each group was then subdivided according to their CD 4 count. Clinical fundus findings were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty six patients (32. 7 %) showed presence of fundus manifestation, majority of which was HIV microangiopathy (89 %) and the rest being Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis (11 %). The most common fundus lesion was cotton wool spot (34 %). There was a higher incidence of fundus manifestation in the non HAART group than the HAART group (P= 0. 04) and in patients with CD 4 count less than 200 cells/ml in both groups (P= 0. 01). The HAART therapy had remarkably reduced the percentage of fundus manifestation by 20 % but CD 4 count remains the marker for fundus manifestations. There were no significant differences noted in the retinal manifestation among the different races. (ANOVA, P= 0. 25). CONCLUSION: The fundus manifestations were higher in patients with CD 4 < 200 cells/ml and in the non HAART group. Hence the HAART therapy is capable of reducing the incidence of fundus manifestations, however the CD 4 count determines the occurrence of fundus manifestations...|$|E
40|$|Data on {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) in HIV-positive patients are limited. The study {{objective was to}} investigate and compare clinical presentation and outcome between HIV-positive and HIV-negative CRC patients. Between September 1985 and November 2003 we identified 27 cases of HIV-positive CRC patients from the cancer registry database - Italian Cooperative <b>Group</b> <b>AIDS</b> and Tumours (GICAT); the clinical presentation/outcome information was retrieved. Each HIV-positive patient from our institution was randomly matched (ratio 1 : 2) with HIV-negative patients (54 controls) based on age, sex, and year of diagnosis {{in the same time}} period. Differences in clinical presentation, treatment, and overall survival were assessed. Of 1130 HIV-negative CRC patients, 54 were identified and matched with 27 HIV-positive patients. Compared with the HIV-negative patients, the HIV-positive patients had a higher risk of lower performance status (PS: > or = 2) (odds ratio (OR) = 14. 4; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 3. 6 - 57. 7), a higher risk of unfavorable Dukes' stage (D) (OR = 4. 9; 95 % CI: 1. 8 - 13. 5), and a higher risk of poor grading (G 3 -G 4) (OR = 5. 0; 95 % CI: 1. 9 - 13. 4). Median overall follow-up was 27 months (range: 2 - 212). At multivariate analysis, the only characteristics that significantly reduced the survival of the CRC patients were: HIV-positive status (hazard ratio (HR) : 2. 4; 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 5. 2) and Dukes' stage D (HR: 3. 7; 95 % CI: 1. 9 - 7. 1).
