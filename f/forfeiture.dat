5|$|In Caplin & Drysdale v. United States (1989), the Court {{held that}} there is no Sixth Amendment {{exception}} to criminal forfeiture; i.e., after conviction, the government can seek <b>forfeiture</b> of already paid legal fees under a <b>forfeiture</b> statute, notwithstanding the effect on the defendant's ability to retain counsel of choice.|$|E

5|$|In Ex parte Milburn (1835), the Court denied an {{original}} habeas petition concerning pretrial detention holding that the <b>forfeiture</b> of bail {{for failure to}} appear did not satisfy a criminal indictment and that a prior granting of the writ of habeas corpus was no bar to a subsequent arrest warrant.|$|E
5|$|After deliberating {{for five}} days the jury found Massino guilty of all eleven counts on July 30, 2004. His {{sentencing}} was initially scheduled for October 12, and {{he was expected to}} receive a sentence of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. The jury also approved the prosecutors' recommended $10 million <b>forfeiture</b> of the proceeds of his reign as Bonanno boss {{on the day of the}} verdict.|$|E
5|$|By 1879, English law {{began to}} {{distinguish}} between suicide and homicide, although suicide still resulted in <b>forfeiture</b> of estate. In 1882, the deceased were permitted daylight burial in England and {{by the middle of}} the 20th century, suicide had become legal in much of the western world. The term suicide first emerged shortly before 1700 to replace expressions on self-death which were often characterized as a form of self-murder in the West.|$|E

Victories over the Scottish robot AllTorque and fellow English entrants Chaos 2, 101 and Behemoth saw Razer win the tournament and its associated title.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 the {{government}} went before Moskowitz seeking summary judgement. The case turned {{on whether the}} KD II was a fishing vessel under the SFPA. Early in 2005 he issued his ruling, holding that while it was not directly engaged in fishing it was nevertheless engaging in activities supporting fishing and thus also subject to the SFPA. He did not grant the <b>forfeiture</b> as NOAA had not moved for it yet.|$|E
5|$|Sanctions {{for such}} infractions may be levied on {{individuals}} or on to clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, points deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the English and Scottish leagues will often deduct 10 points {{from a team}} that enters financial administration. Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game <b>forfeiture.</b> Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.|$|E

5|$|Tai Loong appealed, {{working out}} stipulations with NOAA to {{expedite}} that process. Foremost {{among them was}} an agreement on {{the market value of}} the fins, $618,956, to be forfeited if the appeals court ruled in Tai Loong's favor. The district court granted the <b>forfeiture</b> in the middle of 2005, and the case went to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins (520 F.3d 976) is a 2008 {{decision}} of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concerning civil <b>forfeiture</b> in admiralty law. Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for a three-judge panel that ordered that the shark fins be returned to their owners, reversing {{a decision by the}} Southern District of California. The government did not appeal the case further.|$|E
5|$|A $30,000 supersedeas bond {{was issued}} in August 1965 as the United Bond Insurance Company {{continued}} to dispute {{the payment of}} Kinne's original $25,000 bond. The supersedeas bond allowed the company to defer payment of the $25,000 bond until a ruling on the matter was handed down by the Missouri Supreme Court, but when that court upheld the bond's <b>forfeiture,</b> the $25,000 was paid to the State of Missouri in October 1965. The United Bond Insurance Company later filed suit against Kinne's family to recover {{the cost of the}} bail, lawyer's fees, and searching for Kinne after her escape.|$|E

5|$|During the race, Alessandro Petacchi tested {{positive}} for elevated levels of salbutamol at a doping control on 23 May, after winning Stage 11. Petacchi has a medical exemption to use salbutamol {{in the treatment of}} asthma, but the concentration of the drug in his urine sample from this control was above the therapeutically accepted level. Though the Italian Cycling Federation originally refused to punish him, the Italian National Olympic Committee appealed the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, resulting in a suspension for the rider and <b>forfeiture</b> of all his results from the Giro.|$|E
5|$|Even with Lancaster defeated, {{the battle}} against the rebels was not over. Edmund was charged with {{overtaking}} Wallingford Castle from Maurice de Berkeley in January 1323, a task which he fulfilled with great success. For his loyalty, Edmund was rewarded with substantial holdings in Wales, primarily land forfeited by Roger Mortimer. The greater part of the spoils of war, however, went to the Despensers, who both benefited greatly from the <b>forfeiture</b> of the rebels. By 1326, the Despensers, father and son respectively, enjoyed incomes of £3,800 and £7,000, while Edmund's annual income was at only 2,355 marks (£1,570).|$|E
5|$|Federal {{agencies}} filed {{charges against}} the KD IIs owner, operator and captain. They further sought <b>forfeiture</b> of the fins under in rem jurisdiction, resulting in the unusual case title. Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz granted the order in 2005. The boat's owners appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which reversed Moskowitz three years later. It held that the seizure was illegal for three reasons: the KD IIs activities {{did not meet the}} definition of a fishing vessel under the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Since it did not, under the SFPA, the fins could not have been lawfully seized on the high seas. In 2011, President Barack Obama signed the Shark Conservation Act into law, which closed these loopholes.|$|E

5|$|Following the <b>forfeiture,</b> most of Garmoran {{remained}} with the Scottish crown until 1469, when James III granted Lairdship {{of it to}} John of Ross, the new MacDonald leader, who passed it to his own half-brother, Hugh of Sleat. Clan Ranald objected to the transfer to Hugh, and appear to have retained some level of physical posession, {{regardless of whether they}} any legal authority to do so. The status of Rùm during this period is unclear, as surviving records do not mention it as part of Hugh's possessions.|$|E
5|$|Manning's offenses {{carried a}} maximum {{sentence}} of 90 years. The government asked for 60 {{years as a}} deterrent to others, while Manning's lawyer asked for no more than 25 years. She was sentenced on August 21 to 35 years in prison, reduction in rank to private (private E-1 or PVT), <b>forfeiture</b> of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. She was given credit for 1,293 days of pretrial confinement, including 112 days for her treatment at Quantico, and would have been eligible for parole after serving one-third of the sentence. She was confined at the United States Disciplinary Barracks (USDB) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.|$|E
5|$|Michigan won the 1901 game, 21–0, at Ohio Field in Columbus, Ohio, {{in front}} of a crowd of {{approximately}} 4,000 persons. A special train carried 375 Michigan students to the game on the Ann Arbor and Hocking Valley railroads. Ohio State held the Wolverines to their lowest point total of the 1901 season. Prior to the game, the head coaches argued over the length of the game, Yost insisting on regulation halves of 30 minute and Ohio State's John B. Eckstorm insisting that the first half be limited to 25 minutes. When the umpire threatened Ohio State with a <b>forfeiture,</b> coach Eckstrom agreed to play regulation halves of 30 minutes.|$|E
