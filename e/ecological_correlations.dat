50|$|An {{ecological}} fallacy (or ecological inference fallacy) {{is a logical}} fallacy {{in the interpretation of}} statistical data where inferences about the nature of individuals are deduced from inference for the group to which those individuals belong.

50|$|Choosing to run {{aggregate}} {{or individual}} regressions to understand aggregate impacts on some policy {{depends on the}} following trade off: aggregate regressions lose individual level data but individual regressions add strong modeling assumptions. Some researchers suggest that the ecological correlation gives a better picture {{of the outcome of}} public policy actions, thus they recommend the ecological correlation over the individual level correlation for this purpose (Lubinski & Humphreys, 1996). Other researchers disagree, especially when the relationships among the levels are not clearly modeled. To prevent ecological fallacy, researchers with no individual data can model first what is occurring at the individual level, then model how the individual and group levels are related, and finally examine whether anything occurring at the group level adds {{to the understanding of the}} relationship. For instance, in evaluating the impact of state policies, it is helpful to know that policy impacts vary less among the states than do the policies themselves, suggesting that the policy differences are not well translated into results, despite high <b>ecological</b> <b>correlations</b> (Rose, 1973).|$|E
50|$|In statistics, an <b>ecological</b> <b>{{correlation}}</b> (also spatial correlation) is {{a correlation}} between two variables that are group means, in contrast to {{a correlation between}} two variables that describe individuals.

A study at the individual level might make use of 100 children, then measure both physical activity and weight; the correlation between the two variables would be at the individual level. By contrast, another study might make use of 100 classes of sixth-grade students, then measure the mean physical activity and the mean weight of each of the 100 classes. A correlation between these group means would be an example of an <b>ecological</b> <b>correlation.</b>|$|R

However, when individuals are considered, the correlation was +0.12 (immigrants were on average more illiterate than native citizens). Robinson showed that the negative correlation at the level of state populations was because immigrants tended to settle in states where the native population was more literate. He cautioned against deducing conclusions about individuals on the basis of population-level, or [...] "ecological" [...] data.

Inner ear morphology is linked to phylogeny (we find here a strong phylogenetic signal in the data that can complicate <b>ecological</b> <b>correlations),</b> but also correlated with ecology, with Dinilysia resembling certain semi-fossorial forms (Xenopeltis and Cylindrophis), consistent with previous reports. We here also find striking resemblances between Dinilysia and some semi-aquatic snakes, such as Myron (Caenophidia, Homalopsidae). Therefore, the inner ear morphology of Dinilysia is consistent with semi-aquatic as well as semi-fossorial habits: the most similar forms are either semi-fossorial burrowers with a strong affinity to water (Xenopeltis and Cylindrophis) or amphibious, intertidal forms which shelter in burrows (Myron). Notably, Dinilysia does not cluster as closely with snakes with exclusively terrestrial or obligate burrowing habits (e. g. scolecophidians and uropeltids). Moreover, despite the above similarities, Dinilysia also occupies a totally unique morphospace, raising issues with linking it with any particular ecological category. Alessandro Palci, Mark N.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} {{of the diversity of}} mammalian life histories is based almost exclusively on eutherian mammals, in which the slow–fast continuum persists even after controlling for effects of body size and phylogeny. In this paper, we use modern comparative methods to test the extent to which this eutherian-based framework can be extrapolated to metatherian mammals. First, we examine the pattern of covariation among life history traits, and second, we test for correlations between variation in life history and variation in six candidate ecological variables: type of diet, extent of intraspecific competition, risk of juvenile mortality, diurnal pattern of activity, arboreality, and rainfall pattern. Even when controlling for body size and phylogeny, we observe a slow–fast continuum in metatherian mammals. Some parameters involved are different from those identified by studies of eutherians, but the underlying relationships among longevity, fecundity, and age at maturity persist. We also show that overall variation in a key life history variable, reproductive output (measured by annual reproductive rate and litter size), is significantly related to variation in type of diet, with a foliage-rich diet being associated with low fecundity.

The syphilis prevalence, taken as proxy for sexual behaviour and increased HIV transmission, was first used with health district-level deprivation and population density as a covariate in a HIV prevalence spatial regression model and, secondly, together with HIV as a bivariate outcome. HIV was more highly prevalent in deprived and populated urban areas than elsewhere, while syphilis had a high prevalence in less deprived and less populated rural areas. Spatially, the HIV prevalence was lowest in the southwestern and highest in the northeastern parts of the country. This was in discordance to the syphilis prevalence, which revealed negative correlations with the HIV prevalence. Considerable variations across the districts remained after adjusting for the contextual covariate factors. Divergent spatial patterns between HIV and syphilis were identified, regarding both observed and unobserved covariate effects.

A fat diet, rich in {{saturated}} {{fatty acids}} (SFA) and low in polyun{{saturated fatty acids}} (PUFA), {{is said to be}} an important cause of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The evidence for this hypothesis was sought by reviewing studies of the direct link between dietary fats and atherosclerotic vascular disease in human beings. The review included ecological, dynamic population, cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies, as well as controlled, randomized trials of the effect of fat reduction alone. The positive <b>ecological</b> <b>correlations</b> between national intakes of total fat (TF) and SFA and cardiovascular mortality found in earlier studies were absent or negative in the larger, more recent studies. Secular trends of national fat consumption and mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) in 18 – 35 countries (four studies) during different time periods diverged from each other as often as they coincided. In cross-sectional studies of CHD and atherosclerosis, one group of studies (Bantu people vs. Caucasians) were supportive; six groups of studies (West Indians vs. Americans, Japanese, and Japanese migrants vs. Americans, Yemenite Jews vs. Yemenite migrants; Seminole and Pima Indi-ans vs. Americans, Seven Countries) gave partly supportive, partly contradictive results; in seven groups of studies (Navajo Indians vs. Americans; pure vegetarians vs. lacto-ovo-vegetarians and non-vegetarians, Masai people vs. Americans, Asiatic Indians vs. non-Indians, north vs. south Indians, Indian migrants vs. British resi-dents, Geographic Study of Atherosclerosis) the findings were contradictory.

Mammal community composition and species abundances purportedly result from interactions among species, forest-floor characteristics, large coarse woody debris, understory vegetation, and overstory composition. Coarse woody debris {{is thought to be}} particularly important because of its diverse ecological functions; covers from 10 to 15 % have been recommended based on retrospective studies of forests and small mammals. Unfortunately, <b>ecological</b> <b>correlations</b> are not necessarily indicative of causal relationships and magnitudes depend on composition of finite, usually non-random, cross-sectional samples. Retrospective studies must be replicated to confirm relationships. We conducted a large-scale, cross-sectional survey of 30 - to 70 -year-old coniferous forests in western Washington to determine if previously reported relationships would hold with an unrelated, larger sample. Coarse woody debris cover was 8. 3 ± 0. 6 % (0 ± S. E., n = 8 blocks of forest, range 4 - 13 %). Understory cover was too low (18 ± 8 % for shrubs) to allow examining interactions between understory and coarse woody debris. Overstory composition covaried with coarse woody debris.
