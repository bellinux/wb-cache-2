5|$|After the earthquake, several {{websites}} speculated {{about whether}} hydraulic fracturing (fracking) {{for natural gas}} production could <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> or contributed to the quake.

5|$|Although it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} and parasitism, and changes in agricultural practices <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> local population declines, this widespread and abundant species is not threatened globally.

60|$|The {{question}} how far human volitions {{are subject to}} causal laws is a purely empirical one. Empirically it seems plain that {{the great majority of}} our volitions <b>have</b> <b>causes,</b> but it cannot, on this account, be held necessarily certain that all <b>have</b> <b>causes.</b> There are, however, precisely the same kinds of reasons for regarding it as probable that they all <b>have</b> <b>causes</b> as there are in the case of physical events.|$|R

5|$|Drugs {{may cause}} or affect {{clitoral}} priapism. The drug trazodone {{is known to}} cause male priapism as a side effect, but {{there is only one}} documented report that it may <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> clitoral priapism, in which case discontinuing the medication may be a remedy. Additionally, nefazodone is documented to <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|During its review, Sandia {{determined}} that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> the explosion. A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> {{an explosion in the}} gun breech. Sandia's technicians also found that the physical evidence did not support the U.S. Navy's theory that an electronic or chemical detonator had been used to initiate the explosion.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Cancellor's {{death was}} used in a medical journal article {{discussing}} adult hydrocephalus. Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> or contributed to his death, author Samuel Wilks suggested not only that Cancellor had hydrocephalus, {{but that he was}} consequently more susceptible to physical injury as a result. He pointed to the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and argued that this effusion would <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> physical weakness.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{popularity}} of the sport <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> several environmental concerns, including soil erosion and trampled vegetation as climbers hike off-trail to reach bouldering sites.

50|$|Journalism analysts {{argue that}} the media <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> {{widespread}} compassion fatigue in society by saturating newspapers and news shows with often decontextualized images and stories of tragedy and suffering.

5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E
5|$|A {{study showed}} that high levels of {{nutrients}} used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> frog deformities in ponds and lakes across North America. The study showed increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus cause sharp hikes in the abundance of trematodes, and that the parasites subsequently form cysts in the developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs, extra limbs and other severe malformations including five or six extra or even no limbs.|$|E
