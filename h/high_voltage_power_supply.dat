25|$|Capacitors are {{combined}} in series {{to achieve a}} higher working voltage, for example for smoothing a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> The voltage ratings, {{which are based on}} plate separation, add up, if capacitance and leakage currents for each capacitor are identical. In such an application, on occasion, series strings are connected in parallel, forming a matrix. The goal is to maximize the energy storage of the network without overloading any capacitor. For high-energy storage with capacitors in series, some safety considerations must be applied to ensure one capacitor failing and leaking current does not apply too much voltage to the other series capacitors.|$|E
25|$|Electrospinning is {{a highly}} {{versatile}} technique {{that can be used}} to produce continuous fibers from submicrometer to nanometer diameters. In a typical electrospinning set-up, a solution is fed through a spinneret and a high voltage is applied to the tip. The buildup of electrostatic repulsion within the charged solution, causes it to eject a thin fibrous stream. A mounted collector plate or rod with an opposite or grounded charge draws in the continuous fibers, which arrive to form a highly porous network. The primary advantages of this technique are its simplicity and ease of variation. At a laboratory level, a typical electrospinning set-up only requires a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (up to 30 kV), a syringe, a flat tip needle and a conducting collector. For these reasons, electrospinning has become a common method of scaffold manufacture in many labs. By modifying variables such as the distance to collector, magnitude of applied voltage, or solution flow rate—researchers can dramatically change the overall scaffold architecture.|$|E

25|$|Jepsen has {{described}} {{the removal of the}} filters that color the RGB subpixels as the critical design innovation in the new LCD. Instead of using subtractive color filters, the display uses a plastic diffraction grating and lenses on the rear of the LCD to illuminate each pixel. This grating pattern is stamped using the same technology used to make DVDs. The grating splits the light from the white backlight into a spectrum. The red, green and blue components are diffracted into the correct positions to illuminate the corresponding pixel with R, G or B. This innovation results in a much brighter display for a given amount of backlight illumination: while the color filters in a regular display typically absorb 85% of the light that hits them, this display absorbs little of that light. Most LCD screens at the time used cold cathode fluorescent lamp backlights which were fragile, difficult or impossible to repair, required a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> were relatively power-hungry, and accounted for 50% of the screens' cost (sometimes 60%).

2500|$|Thermionic diode {{rectifiers}} {{were widely}} used in power supplies in vacuum tube consumer electronic products, such as phonographs, radios, and televisions, for example the All American Five radio receiver, to provide the high DC plate voltage needed by other vacuum tubes. [...] "Full-wave" [...] versions with two separate plates were popular because they could be used with a center-tapped transformer to make a full-wave rectifier. [...] Vacuum tube rectifiers were made for very high voltages, such as the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> for the cathode ray tube of television receivers, and the kenotron used for power supply in X-ray equipment. [...] However, compared to modern semiconductor diodes, vacuum tube rectifiers have high internal resistance due to space charge and therefore high voltage drops, causing high power dissipation and low efficiency. [...] They are rarely able to handle currents exceeding 250mA owing {{to the limits of}} plate power dissipation, and cannot be used for low voltage applications, [...] such as battery chargers. Another limitation of the vacuum tube rectifier is that the heater power supply often requires special arrangements to insulate it from the high voltages of the rectifier circuit.|$|E
2500|$|The {{instrumentation}} {{needed to}} perform capillary electrophoresis is relatively simple. [...] A basic schematic of a capillary electrophoresis system {{is shown in}} figure 1. [...] The system's main components are a sample vial, source and destination vials, a capillary, electrodes, [...] a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> a detector, and a data output and handling device. The source vial, destination vial and capillary are filled with an electrolyte such as an aqueous buffer solution. [...] To introduce the sample, the capillary inlet is placed into a vial containing the sample. [...] Sample is introduced into the capillary via capillary action, pressure, siphoning, or electrokinetically, and the capillary is then returned to the source vial. [...] The migration of the analytes is initiated by an electric field that is applied between the source and destination vials and is supplied to the electrodes by the high-voltage power supply. [...] In the most common mode of CE, all ions, positive or negative, are pulled through the capillary in the same direction by electroosmotic flow. [...] The analytes separate as they migrate due to their electrophoretic mobility, and are detected near the outlet end of the capillary. The output of the detector is sent to a data output and handling device such as an integrator or computer. The data is then displayed as an electropherogram, which reports detector response as a function of time. Separated chemical compounds appear as peaks with different retention times in an electropherogram. [...] Capillary electrophoresis was first combined with mass spectrometry by Richard D. Smith and coworkers, and provides extremely high sensitivity for the analysis of very small sample sizes. [...] Despite the very small sample sizes (typically only a few nanoliters of liquid are introduced into the capillary), high sensitivity and sharp peaks are achieved in part due to injection strategies that result in concentration of analytes into a narrow zone near the inlet of the capillary. [...] This is achieved in either pressure or electrokinetic injections simply by suspending the sample in a buffer of lower conductivity (e.g. lower salt concentration) than the running buffer. [...] A process called field-amplified sample stacking (a form of isotachophoresis) results in concentration of analyte in a narrow zone at the boundary between the low-conductivity sample and the higher-conductivity running buffer.|$|E
