5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{is invited}} by her boss Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to spend Christmas {{with him to}} help him deal with a visit from his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). Liz finds it strange that Jack's fiancée Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) will not spend the holiday with him and {{immediately}} realizes that Jack has not told his mother about Avery's pregnancy. Avery becomes angry, but she and Liz convince him to tell her which he promises to do. Jack tells Colleen about the news {{but she is not}} excited about the pregnancy as Jack and Avery are not married. To get back at her, Jack calls his biological father Milton Greene (Alan Alda), the father she never told him he had, and invites him to spend Christmas with him, and does not inform him that Colleen will be present. The next day, Milton arrives and Jack explains the reason for his visit is so that he can ambush Colleen as she looks down on his relationship with Avery. Later, Avery arrives and is angered about what Colleen said about her relationship with Jack. Liz tries to warn Colleen about Jack's plan but to no avail. She is shocked to see Milton, but immediately figures out what Jack is up to. Colleen gets even with Jack by faking a heart attack, which causes Milton and Avery to <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> thus abandoning their plan to reprimand Colleen. At the hospital, Avery reveals that she and Jack had planned to elope over New Year's and extends an invitation to everyone. After the announcement, Liz leaves and travels to White Haven, Pennsylvania to spend Christmas with her family.|$|E
500|$|Marquess {{deemed the}} storyline {{as a whole}} one which could only be {{depicted}} {{the way it was}} in Hollyoaks, aiming to tell a [...] "tragic story" [...] with a [...] "sweet and humorous tone"." [...] A comedy element of the storyline had Steph use her cancer as a sob story to enter a talent show, recruiting orphan Tom to take to the stage with her, giving her story further emotional impact. Stenson commented, [...] "Deep down she knows she's not a fantastic singer, but she thought the judges would <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and put her through." [...] According to Quinlan, viewer feedback on the storyline was [...] "brilliant". He stated that viewers were upset by Steph's illness, and that it had even brought his own mother to tears.|$|E
2500|$|Cody {{filed for}} divorce in 1904, after 38 years of marriage. This {{decision}} was made after years of jealous arguments, bad blood between {{his wife and his}} sisters, and friction between the children and their father. By 1891, Cody had instructed his brother-in-law to handle Frederici's affairs and property, stating [...] "I often <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She is a strange woman but I don't mind her—remember she is my wife—and let it go at that. If she gets cranky, just laugh at it, she can't help it." [...] Cody hoped to keep the divorce quiet, so as to not disrupt his show or his stage persona, but Frederici had other ideas.|$|E
50|$|Five years later, young Rodasan (Pao's son), {{traveled}} to his father's palace to find food {{for his mother}} and meet Suntamala. <b>Feeling</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> actions, Suntamala loved Rodasan and adopted him as her son and promised him that she will never do something wrong again.|$|R

5000|$|In episode 2 of Hell Teacher Nūbē, {{the title}} {{character}} {{and two of his}} students seek for Hanako-san in the school toilets. Instead, they find the spirit of a little girl (apparently also named Hanako, though it is not confirmed), who died during the Tokyo bombings in World War II. <b>Feeling</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> Nūbē comforts the ghost girl and sends her to Heaven with his powers.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Jason Damas, {{in a review}} for PopMatters, felt that the song sounds [...] "almost exactly like Dizzee Rascal", and added, [...] "Lyrically, this is where Gwen sinks the lowest here, {{especially}} on a breakdown where she repeats, 'This shit is bananas / B-A-N-A-N-A-S!' several times". Eric Greenwood of Drawer B called the song [...] "moronic and embarrassingly tuneless. I'd quote the lyrics, but they're so bad, I almost <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> A 35-year-old woman singing about pom-poms and 'talking shit' in high school betrays such a delusional self-image that it's {{hard not to be}} taken aback. And on top of that, The Neptunes' beats are clunky and the production is senselessly bombastic." [...] Nick Sylvester of Pitchfork also criticized the track, referring to it as a [...] "Queen pastiche [...] which has about as much club potential as a 13-year old with a milk moustache and his dad's ID". However, despite this initial review, Pitchfork would later place the track at number 35 on its list of the Top 50 Singles of 2005, and at number 180 on its list of The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s. Maxim was unimpressed with the song, and in its October 2005 issue, published a list of the [...] "20 Most Annoying Songs Ever" [...] with [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] in first place.|$|E

50|$|Anthropomorphic motifs {{have been}} common in fairy {{tales from the}} {{earliest}} ancient examples set in a mythological context to the great collections of the Brothers Grimm and Perrault. The Tale of Two Brothers (Egypt, 13th century BCE) features several talking cows and in Cupid and Psyche (Rome, 2nd century CE) Zephyrus, the west wind, carries Psyche away.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{answered}} the lawyer, putting on {{an air of}} deep concern (and {{as a matter of}} fact he really did <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her),</b> [...] "I think it was the most painful professional experience that I ever had. The poor woman was utterly crushed. She said that it would kill her father." ...|$|E
60|$|The more Ralph's mind dwelt {{upon the}} matter, the more {{dissatisfied}} did he {{feel that this}} beautiful young creature should marry the rector. If, in truth, she applied the fable to him, this {{was all the more}} reason why he should <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> If anything of all this showed itself in his eyes, he did not know it, but Dora's eyes opened to their full width, and grew softer.|$|E

[...] "I got the tray ready with my own hands that was sent to her room; but she wouldn't touch it. I presume she didn't like having a plate {{prepared}} for her!

Gaby admits that she gave Grace the jewellery as a present because she <b>feels</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> as she is poor.|$|R

Over the next few months, Aylward saves her money to purchase a ticket on the Trans-Siberian railway, choosing the more dangerous overland route to the East because it is less expensive.|$|R

6000|$|... "It might. Beatrice {{will try}} to accept her husband's views, and she'll {{probably}} find it easier than she thinks; but at present all she sees and hears will remind her of the changes {{she will have to}} make. Things you do will not seem right; some of your ideas will jar. Then the other women will let her see that they <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and think she's throwing herself away. She'll deny it, but it will hurt." ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{taking one}} look at his face, she slipped in ever so quietly, like a very good child.... Marvellous the {{instinct}} and finesse of the young when they are women!... Not a vestige in her of yesterday's seductive power; not a sign {{that there had been}} a yesterday at all--just confiding, like a daughter. Sitting there, telling him about Ireland, showing him the little batch of drawings she had done while she was away. Had she brought them because she knew they would make him <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her?</b> What could have been less dangerous, more appealing to the protective and paternal side of him than she was that morning; as if she only wanted what her father and her home could not give her--only wanted to be a sort of daughter to him! ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the trail}} {{permitted}} he let them go, and swung, lost in gloomy thoughts, with the jolting of the rig. The damaging part of Wilkinson's statement was false, but since part was true the tale would spread and some would believe the worst. It {{was impossible to}} doubt Helen, but he was angry with her. She had let her ridiculous notion of reforming Bob carry her away. Festing did not think Bob could be reformed, but it was Sadie's business, not Helen's. Besides, he had objected to her encouraging the fellow to hang about the homestead, and she had disregarded his warnings. Now, the thing must be stopped, {{and it would be}} horribly disagreeable to tell her why. She had been obstinate and rash, but after all she meant well and would be badly hurt. He began to <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> and his angry thought's centered on Charnock.|$|E
50|$|Mary signs {{a warrant}} for {{execution}} of both Lady Jane Grey and her husband, Guilford Dudley. She is sympathetic towards Jane, offering her {{a few more days}} before the execution, while promising to spare her life, if she converts from the Protestant faith to the Catholic faith. Stubborn in her religious ways, Jane refuses and pays the price. On February 12, 1554, Jane is taken to the Tower Green, where she faces the scaffold and dies a traitor's death.

60|$|I lit a {{pipe and}} waited for the sun. The sky in front of me was tinged with a faint pink. Every moment it flushed a deeper red. I {{maintain}} that anyone, not an expert, would have said that was the portion of the horizon on which to keep one's eye. I kept my eye upon it, but no sun appeared. I lit another pipe. The sky in front of me was now a blaze of glory. I scribbled a few lines, likening the scattered clouds to brides blushing at the approach of the bridegroom. That would have been all right if later on they hadn't begun to turn green: it seemed the wrong colour for a bride. Later on still they went yellow, and that spoilt the simile past hope. One cannot wax poetical about a bride who at the approach of the bridegroom turns first green and then yellow: you can only <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> I waited some more. The sky in front of me grew paler every moment. I began to fear that something had happened to that sun. If I hadn't known so much astronomy I should have said that he had changed his mind and had gone back again. I rose with the idea of seeing into things. He had been up apparently for hours: he had got up at the back of me. It seemed to be nobody's fault. I put my pipe into my pocket and strolled round to the front. The cow was still there; she was pleased to see me, and started bellowing again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean for}} Miss Sloper," [...] said Mrs. Montgomery. The Doctor liked this; {{it had the}} accent of sincerity. [...] "Exactly; that's the point. If my poor girl should marry your brother, everything--as regards her happiness--would depend on his being a good fellow. She is the best {{creature}} in the world, and she could never do him a grain of injury. He, on the other hand, if {{he should not be}} all that we desire, might make her very miserable. That is why I want you to throw some light upon his character, you know. Of course you are not bound to do it. My daughter, whom you have never seen, is nothing to you; and I, possibly, am only an indiscreet and impertinent old man. It is perfectly open to you to tell me that my visit is in very bad taste and that I had better go about my business. But I don't think you will do this; because I think we shall interest you, my poor girl and I. I am sure that if you were to see Catherine, she would interest you very much. I don't mean because she is interesting in the usual sense of the word, but because you would <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She is so soft, so simple-minded, she would be such an easy victim! A bad husband would have remarkable facilities for making her miserable; for she would have neither the intelligence nor the resolution to get the better of him, and yet she would have an exaggerated power of suffering. I see," [...] added the Doctor, with his most insinuating, his most professional laugh, [...] "you are already interested!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{thought it}} was pretty {{manifest}} that the elderly lady was embarrassed at finding herself in such a conspicuous place arrayed in such cheap apparel; I began to <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and troubled about her. She tried to seem very busy with her prayer-book and her responses, and unconscious that {{she was out of}} place, but I said to myself, [...] "She is not succeeding--there is a distressed tremulousness in her voice which betrays increasing embarrassment." [...] Presently the Savior's name was mentioned, and in her flurry she lost her head completely, and rose and courtesied, instead of making a slight nod as everybody else did. The sympathetic blood surged to my temples and I turned and gave those fine birds what I intended to be a beseeching look, but my feelings got the better of me and changed it into a look which said, [...] "If any of you pets of fortune laugh at this poor soul, you will deserve to be flayed for it." [...] Things went from bad to worse, and I shortly found myself mentally taking the unfriended lady under my protection. My mind was wholly upon her. I forgot all about the sermon. Her embarrassment took stronger and stronger hold upon her; she got to snapping the lid of her smelling-bottle--it made a loud, sharp sound, but in her trouble she snapped and snapped away, unconscious of what she was doing. The last extremity was reached when the collection-plate began its rounds; the moderate people threw in pennies, the nobles and the rich contributed silver, but she laid a twenty-mark gold piece upon the book-rest before her with a sounding slap! I said to myself, [...] "She has parted with all her little hoard to buy the consideration of these unpitying people--it is a sorrowful spectacle." [...] I did not venture to look around this time; but as the service closed, I said to myself, [...] "Let them laugh, it is their opportunity; but at the door of this church they shall see her step into our fine carriage with us, and our gaudy coachman shall drive her home." ...|$|E

60|$|It was not always, as I have hinted, that Mrs. Lemon entered {{completely}} {{into the}} views of her son, though in form she never failed to subscribe to them devoutly. She had never yet, for instance, apprehended his reason for marrying poor Lady Barb. This was a great secret, and she was determined, in her gentleness, {{that no one should}} ever know it. For herself, she was sure that to the end of time she shouldn’t discover Jackson’s reason. She might never ask about it, for that of course would betray her. From the first she had told him she was delighted, there being no need of asking for explanations then, as the young lady herself, when she should come to know her, would explain. But the young lady hadn’t yet explained and after this evidently never would. She was very tall, very handsome, she answered exactly to Mrs. Lemon’s prefigurement of the daughter of a lord, and she wore her clothes, which were peculiar, but to one of her shape remarkably becoming, very well. But she didn’t elucidate; we know ourselves that there was very little that was explanatory about Lady Barb. So Mrs. Lemon continued to wonder, to ask herself, “Why that one, more than so many others who’d have been more natural?” The choice struck her, as I have said, as quite arbitrary. She found Lady Barb very different from other girls she had known, and this led her almost immediately to <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> daughter-in-law. She felt how the girl was to be pitied if she found her husband’s people as peculiar as his mother found her, since the result of that would be to make her very lonesome. Lady Agatha was different, because she seemed to keep nothing back; you saw all there was of her, and she was evidently not home-sick. Mrs. Lemon could see that Barbarina was ravaged by this last ailment and was also too haughty to show it. She even had a glimpse of the ultimate truth; namely, that Jackson’s wife had not the comfort of crying, because that would have amounted to a confession that she had been idiotic enough to believe in advance that, in an American town, in the society of doctors, she should escape such pangs. Mrs. Lemon treated her with studied consideration—all the indulgence that was due to a young woman in the unfortunate position of having been married one couldn’t tell why.|$|E
