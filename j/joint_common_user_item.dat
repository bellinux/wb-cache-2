40|$|Collaborative Filtering (CF) Systems {{have been}} studied {{extensively}} {{for more than a}} decade to confront the "information overload" problem. Nearest-neighbor CF is based either on <b>common</b> <b>user</b> or <b>item</b> similarities, to form the user's neighborhood. The e#ectiveness of the aforementioned approaches would be augmented, if we could combine them. In this paper, we use biclustering to disclose this duality between <b>users</b> and <b>items,</b> by grouping them in both dimensions simultaneously. We propose a novel nearest-biclusters algorithm, which uses a new similarity measure that achieves partial matching of users' preferences. Performance evaluation results are o#ered, which show that the proposed method improves substantially the performance of the CF process. We attain more than 30 % and 10 % improvement in terms of precision and recall, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Collaborative {{filtering}} (CF) is {{an important}} and popular technology for recommender systems. However, current CF methods suffer from such problems as data sparsity, recommendation inaccuracy, and big-error in predictions. In this paper, we borrow ideas of object typicality from cognitive psychology and propose a novel typicality-based collaborative filtering recommendation method named TyCo. A distinct feature of typicality-based CF is that it finds “neighbors ” of users based on user typicality degrees in user groups (instead of the corated <b>items</b> of <b>users,</b> or <b>common</b> <b>users</b> of <b>items,</b> as in traditional CF). To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there has been no prior work on investigating CF recommendation by combining object typicality. TyCo outperforms many CF recommendation methods on recommendation accuracy (in terms of MAE) with an improvement of at least 6. 35 percent in Movielens data set, especially with sparse training data (9. 89 percent improvement on MAE) and has lower time cost than other CF methods. Further, it can obtain more accurate predictions with less number of big-error predictions. Index Terms—Recommendation, typicality, collaborative filtering Ç...|$|R

40|$|Standard common causal {{explanations}} of the EPR situation assume a so-called <b>joint</b> <b>common</b> cause system that is a common cause for all correlations. However, the assumption of a <b>joint</b> <b>common</b> cause system together with some other physically motivated assumptions concerning locality and no-conspiracy results in various Bell inequalities. Since Bell inequalities are violated for appropriate measurement settings, a local, non-conspiratorial <b>joint</b> <b>common</b> causal explanation of the EPR situation is ruled out. But why do we assume that a common causal explanation {{of a set of}} correlation consists in finding a <b>joint</b> <b>common</b> cause system for all correlations and not just in finding separate common cause systems for the different correlations? What are the perspectives of a local, non-conspiratorial separate common causal explanation for the EPR scenario? And finally, how do Bell inequalities relate to the weaker assumption of separate common cause systems?...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{there is}} a surge of social recommendation, which leverages social {{relations}} among users to improve recommendation performance. However, in many applications, social relations are absent or very sparse. Meanwhile, the attribute information of <b>users</b> or <b>items</b> may be rich. It is a big challenge to exploit these attribute information {{for the improvement of}} recommendation performance. In this paper, we organize objects and relations in recommendation system as a heterogeneous information network, and introduce meta path based similarity measure to evaluate the similarity of <b>users</b> or <b>items.</b> Furthermore, a matrix factorization based dual regularization framework SimMF is proposed to flexibly integrate different types of information through adopting the similarity of <b>users</b> and <b>items</b> as regularization on latent factors of <b>users</b> and <b>items.</b> Extensive experiments not only validate the effectiveness of SimMF but also reveal some interesting findings. We find that attribute information of <b>users</b> and <b>items</b> can significantly improve recommendation accuracy, and their contribution seems more important than that of social relations. The experiments also reveal that different regularization models have obviously different impact on <b>users</b> and <b>items.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

We define a rating graph containing <b>users</b> and <b>items</b> as vertices and ratings as weighted edges. We extend {{the work of}} [1] that uses the resistance distance on the bipartite rating graph incorporating negative edge weights into the calculation of the resistance distance. This algorithm is then compared to other rating prediction algorithms using data from two rating corpora. ...|$|R
40|$|Collaborative Filtering (CF) is {{a popular}} way to build {{recommender}} systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. Generally, two kinds of approaches to CF, the local neighborhood methods and the global matrix factorization models, have been widely studied. Though some previous researches target on com-bining the complementary advantages of both approaches, the per-formance is still limited due to the extreme sparsity of the rat-ing data. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} consider more informa-tion for better reflecting <b>user</b> preference and <b>item</b> content. To that end, in this paper, by leveraging the extra tagging data, we pro-pose a novel unified two-stage recommendation framework, named Neighborhood-aware ProbabilisticMatrix Factorization(NHPMF). Specifically, we first use the tagging data to select neighbors of each <b>user</b> and each <b>item,</b> then add unique Gaussian distributions on each <b>user’s</b> (<b>item’s)</b> latent feature vector in the matrix factoriza-tion to ensure similar <b>users</b> (<b>items)</b> will have similar latent features. Since the proposed method can effectively explores the external data source (i. e., tagging data) in a unified probabilistic model, it leads to more accurate recommendations. Extensive experimental results on two real world datasets demonstrate that our NHPMF model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods...|$|R
