Most Reverend Ludovic Taurin-Cahagne, Bishop of Adramythe in Ethiopia, Apostolic Vicar of the Gallas, ca. 1875, had a unique, lovely ring that locked/unlocked, apparently an early form of adjustability (and perhaps a security mechanism).|$|E

5000|$|A lock is a {{mechanism}} that secures buildings, rooms, cabinets, or other storage facilities. Locksmithing in traditional Korea had {{the elements of}} both science and art. Korean locks have {{the characteristics of a}} [...] "secret lock" [...] since they entail a complex structure that must be understood before the lock can be opened. That is, a key in itself is not sufficient to open the lock. An understanding of the overall structure and <b>inner</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the lock also is required. Typically, a Korean lock is cylindrical in shape, while its key is L-shaped. As a secret lock, it is difficult to open because its keyhole is concealed by the overall design and there is a specific set of movements that must be followed after inserting the key to match its <b>inner</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Generally speaking, after the keyhole has been located, it takes from two to seven steps executed in a specific sequence to open a secret lock. Traditionally, Korean locks were individually tailored by artisans and fit with unique mechanisms.|$|E

50|$|A {{reconfigurable}} antenna is {{an antenna}} capable of modifying dynamically its frequency and radiation properties {{in a controlled}} and reversible manner. In order to provide a dynamical response, reconfigurable antennas integrate an <b>inner</b> <b>mechanism</b> (such as RF switches, varactors, mechanical actuators or tunable materials) that enable the intentional redistribution of the RF currents over the antenna surface and produce reversible modifications over its properties. Reconfigurable antennas differ from smart antennas because the reconfiguration mechanism lies inside the antenna rather than in an external beamforming network. The reconfiguration capability of reconfigurable antennas is used to maximize the antenna performance in a changing scenario or to satisfy changing operating requirements.|$|E

However, within one hour of closest approach to Jupiter it can take up to 3 km pixel, thus exceeding the resolution of Cassini up to that that time on Saturn.|$|E

Natural systems exhibit many interesting examples of complex behaviours with powerful capabilities for organization, coordination, labour division, collective regulation, etc. We propose in this paper a framework of mobile agents based on a indirect chemicallike communication medium for distributed problem solving and remote control. This distributed mechanism leads to an emergent and complex collective behaviour rooted into local interactions. After depicting the base of this approach, we describe the <b>inner</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of A. N. T. We also illustrate its efficiency with experiences and results...|$|R

We describe the general framework and we illustrate its application to three hard combinatorial problems. Experimental results on three hard combinatorial optimization problems show that the approach is very effective and it enables considerable enhancement of the performance of saving-based algorithm...|$|R
50|$|The Dunlop valve, (also {{called a}} Woods valve or an English valve) {{is a type}} of {{pneumatic}} valve stem in use in some countries, such as Japan, Czech Republic, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Poland, Romania, Russia, the Netherlands, Germany, Britain, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and a number of developing countries, mostly on bicycle inner tubes. It has a wider base than a Presta valve, similar enough in size to a Schrader valve to use identically drilled valve holes in rims, but it can be inflated with a Presta valve adapter. The <b>inner</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the valve can be replaced easily, without the need for special tools. The inventor was C. H. Woods. It superseded Dunlop's original valve for pneumatic tyres.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1870s Ostrovsky's plays became more experimental, had little success {{on stage and}} {{were more or less}} disliked by critics. [...] "The Impotence of Creative Thought", the title of Nikolai Shelgunov's article in Delo magazine, {{reflected}} the general mood. While in the old days Ostrovsky was criticised for being too epic and paying little attention to form, Late Love (Поздняя любовь, 1873) and Wolves and Sheep (Волки и овцы, 1875), with their perfect <b>inner</b> <b>mechanism</b> of action and technical gloss, were seen as too [...] "French-like in structure."

50|$|The Panasonic Lumix DMC-L1 and the Leica Digilux 3 {{are both}} built {{using the same}} basic <b>inner</b> <b>mechanism</b> from the Olympus E-330, and thus also share the live preview function. Unlike the E-330 however, neither the L1 or Digilux 3 {{incorporated}} the second sensor in the viewfinder chamber and could only produce the liveview output from the main sensor. They still suffered from the same darker viewfinder as they shared the same mirror to divert 20% of the light for the non-existent secondary sensor. However, {{they were able to}} use AF on the main sensor by briefly dropping the mirror from their launch, and offered live histogram, live white balance preview and live metering during main sensor Live Preview, which the E-330 did not. On the other hand, all three manufacturers suggested that the eyepiece should be blocked during main-sensor live preview to prevent light ingress affecting the process, but only the E-330 included a built-in eyepiece shutter, operated by a lever next to the eyepiece.|$|E

50|$|Buck Rogers was {{broadcast}} from a 21st-floor studio {{that had been}} troubled with air conditioning noises. At a bend in a duct the air gave a whoosh that had been difficult to dampen. Later, when it became necessary to suggest a rocket traveling through outer space, someone remembered the duct and put a microphone in the bend. Whenever Buck Rogers was on the move, the microphone was opened, producing {{the sound of a}} spaceship. This was the first development in sound filters. Filters developed upon the need for radio directors {{to find a way to}} portray a voice over the telephone. The filters were generally small boxes through which a microphone circuit could be shunted. The box had dials on its surface. Its <b>inner</b> <b>mechanism</b> could remove upper or lower tones or a combination of them to give an incomplete reproduction, as given by a telephone. The dials allowed the engineer to vary the effect, creating varieties of incompleteness. It became common for radio personnel to play around with the filters to find new sounds, and then having radio shows based upon their discoveries.|$|E
5000|$|Jaime's body is reconstructed with parts {{similar to}} Steve's, {{but the actual}} cost of {{rebuilding}} her is not revealed. It is said humorously in dialogue {{to be less than}} the $6 million it cost to rebuild Austin because the replacement parts for her were [...] "smaller" [...] (though in Germany the show was called Die Sieben Millionen Dollar Frau, which translates as The Seven Million Dollar Woman). Like Steve before her, Jaime is given two bionic legs, capable of propelling her at speeds exceeding 60 mph (having been clocked at more than 62 mph in [...] "Doomsday Is Tomorrow" [...] and outpacing a race car going 100 mph in [...] "Winning is Everything") and jumping to and from great heights, and her right arm is replaced by a lifelike prosthetic capable of bending steel or throwing objects great distances. Whereas Austin received a bionic eye, the <b>inner</b> <b>mechanism</b> of Jaime's right ear is replaced by a bionic device that gives her amplified hearing such that she can detect most sounds regardless of volume or frequency. These bionic implants cannot be distinguished from natural body parts, except on occasions where they sustain damage and the mechanisms beneath the skin become exposed, as seen in Part 2 of the episode [...] "Doomsday Is Tomorrow", when Jaime sustained damage to her right leg. Jaime discovers on vacation in the Bahamas her artificial bionic skin cannot suntan with exposure to sunlight.|$|E

In {{order to}} improve the real time {{prediction}} precision of sensor output time series, the predictable <b>inner</b> <b>mechanism</b> of time series is analyzed, and a method using wavelet filtering and neural network is proposed. Sensor output time series are first handled with wavelet filtering, and then predicted by neural network method. The proposed method can eliminate effect of measurement noise on prediction precision. Simulation experiment shows a higher prediction precision by the method. A new idea is given to increase prediction precision of sensor output time series by neural network-based methods. 1...|$|E
