5|$|Only minute {{traces of}} {{technetium}} occur naturally in the Earth's crust. This is because technetium-98's half-life is only 4.2millionyears. More {{than a thousand}} of such periods have passed since {{the formation of the}} Earth, so the probability for the survival of even one atom of primordial technetium is <b>effectively</b> <b>zero.</b> However, small amounts exist as spontaneous fission products in uranium ores. A kilogram of uranium contains an estimated 1nanogram (10−9g) of technetium. Some red giant stars with the spectral types S-, M-, and N contain a spectral absorption line indicating the presence of technetium. These red-giants are known informally as technetium stars.|$|E

25|$|Viral control efforts {{can also}} impact {{the rate at}} which virus populations evolve, thereby {{influencing}} phylogenetic patterns. Phylodynamic approaches that quantify how evolutionary rates change over time can therefore provide insight into the effectiveness of control strategies. For example, an application to HIV sequences within infected hosts showed that viral substitution rates dropped to <b>effectively</b> <b>zero</b> following the initiation of antiretroviral drug therapy. This decrease in substitution rates was interpreted as an effective cessation of viral replication following the commencement of treatment, and would be expected to lead to lower viral loads. This finding is especially encouraging because lower substitution rates are associated with slower progression to AIDS in treatment-naive patients.|$|E

Although no list {{can be considered}} exhaustive, Moore’s [1] enunciation of criteria still appears pertinent and {{can be considered as}} a fundamental basis for selection. Table 1 encapsulates some common criteria for selection. This paper uses the well-established Fuzzy C-Means Clustering Algorithm for suggesting a heuristic that <b>effectively</b> <b>zeroes</b> down upon a set of viable locations out of several alternatives. Besides the list of desirable location candidates, the methodology also provides a list of totally inappropriate alternatives that must be weeded out from the process of selection. The paper also proposes a self-devised scoring mechanism that is used to rank the short-listed locations. The proposed methodology is validated on three problems, and an example is presented...|$|R
500|$|Director Tom Shadyac {{felt the}} film {{reflected}} environmental themes of how humans are stewards of God's creation. In {{keeping with the}} themes, Evan Almighty became NBC Universal's first film to offset the production's carbon emissions. Producer Michael Bostick revealed how the emissions were offset: [...] "We worked closely with The Conservation Fund to calculate our carbon emissions from what we used on the movie—whether from vehicles used {{or any of the}} construction equipment. Once our carbon emissions were calculated, we planted trees that will <b>effectively</b> <b>zero</b> out our climate-changing footprint left behind from the movie." [...] Shadyac accomplished this by requiring crew members to plant 2,050 trees at the Rappahannock River Valley National Wildlife Refuge in Warsaw, Virginia and the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge near Modesto, California. He also bought over 400 bikes for all the cast and crew, to get to work instead of driving. In addition, rather than simply demolishing sets, Shadyac tried to donate houses built for the production and had the Ark set recycled, by donating materials to Habitat for Humanity. During the premiere of the film for cast and crew at Universal Citywalk, the attendees were encouraged to donate to a campaign to plant trees in forests around the world. The after party used recycled cups and plates to offset the use of resources. Shadyac also required that when Industrial Light & Magic developed the climactic scene, that the CGI flood did not appear to harm any of the trees in the scene.|$|E

40|$|The nonzero "response time " of AV {{technologies}} {{offers a}} lacuna for hackers to exploit. By the time an AV company responds with a signature {{to detect a}} malicious sample, a hacker may release thousands of new variants. We present a self-learning AV scanner that <b>effectively</b> <b>zeroes</b> the response time needed to detect variants. The scanner uses methods from information retrieval research {{to determine whether a}} suspected sample is a variant of existing, known variant using an inexact match approach. The system is self-learning in that it is trained initially on known malicious samples in the AV research lab, but in the simplest case the knowledge base is not updated automatically. Utilizing the inexact matching properties of the scanner, this paper introduces several schemes for implementing automatic self-learning on top of the basic Vilo system, both for “in the cloud ” learning and by integrating it into existing end-point scanners. ...|$|R

And this even taking into account the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents, in which few people were killed directly and few excess cancers will be caused by releases of radioactivity to the environment. Some proponents acknowledge that most people will not accept this sort of statistical argument nor will they believe reassuring statements from industry or government.

40|$|The open {{educational}} resources (OER) {{movement has}} gained momentum {{in the past few}} years. With this new drive towards making knowledge open and accessible, a large number of OER repositories have been established and made available online throughout the world. However, the inability of existing search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Bing to effectively search for useful OER which are of acceptable academic standard for teaching purposes is a major factor contributing to the slow uptake of the entire movement. As a major step towards solving this issue, this paper proposes OERScout, a technology framework based on text mining solutions. The objectives of our work are to (i) develop a technology framework which will parametrically measure the usefulness of an OER for a particular academic purpose based on the openness, accessibility, and relevance attributes; and (ii) provide academics with a mechanism to locate OER which are of an acceptable academic standard. From our user tests, we have identified that OERScout is a sound solution for <b>effectively</b> <b>zeroing</b> in on OER which can be readily used for teaching and learning purposes...|$|R

40|$|A bicycle or {{inverted}} pendulum can be balanced, that is kept nearly up-right, by {{accelerating the}} base. This balance {{is achieved by}} steering on a bicycle. Simultaneously one can also control the lateral position of the base: changing of the track line of a bike or the position of hand un-der a balanced stick. We show here with theory and experiment that if the balance problem is removed, by making the system neutrally stable for balance, one can’t simultaneously maintain balance and control {{the position of the}} base. We made a bricycle, essentially a bicycle with springy training wheels. The stiffness of the training wheel suspension can be varied from near infinite, making the bricycle into a tricycle, to zero, making it effec-tively a bicycle. The springy training wheels effectively reduce or even negate gravity, at least for balance purposes. One might expect a smooth transition from tricycle to bicycle as the stiffness is varied, in terms of handling, balance and feel. Not so. At an intermediate stiffness, when gravity is <b>effectively</b> <b>zeroed,</b> riders can balance easily but no longer turn. Small turns cause an intolerable leaning. Thus there is a qualitative difference between bicycles and tricycles, a difference that cannot be met halfway...|$|R

40|$|Do {{the rich}} save more? This paper {{exploits}} inheritance flows in Denmark to pro-vide evidence {{on how a}} change in available resources affect saving behavior. Combin-ing the random timing of parental death with a unique panel dataset of third-party reported individual wealth holdings drawn from Danish administrative records, I es-timate the causal effect of money windfalls on saving rates. This paper {{is the first to}} show not only that large windfalls of money crowd-out wealth accumulation in the long run, but also that they affect differently the accumulation of different wealth components. In the short run, heirs use inheritances to accumulate liquid assets, invest in the financial market and amass housing equity, but not to repay existing debts. In the long run, they deplete this excess of wealth by slacking their saving efforts. A increase in available resources of one year of permanent income cuts saving rates by ten percentage points in two years, <b>effectively</b> <b>zeroing</b> wealth accumulation, and strong effects persists until up to four to five years. These results not only imply that inheritance taxation can depress consumption, but provide micro-founded evi-dence on the relationship between wealth and savings that can be compared against predictions from existing consumption theories...|$|R

However, many municipalities finance solid waste services from general tax revenues, in which case waste generators <b>effectively</b> face <b>zero</b> marginal costs. Here, the efficiency losses are much larger, indicating that communities would benefit from introducing volume or weight-based pricing. ...|$|R
30|$|The source {{separation}} {{performance of}} ICA {{can also be}} seen from a beamforming perspective. When the unmixing filters learned by ICA are viewed as frequency-variant beamformers, it can be shown that successful ICA <b>effectively</b> places <b>zeros</b> in the directions of all interfering sources [23]. Therefore, the zero directions of the unmixing filters should be indicative of all source directions. Thus, when the local direction of arrival (DOA) is estimated from the phase of any one given time-frequency bin, this should give an indication of the dominant source in this bin. This is the principle underlying phase-based time-frequency masking strategies.|$|R
