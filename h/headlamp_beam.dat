40|$|This study {{quantified}} drivers' {{ability to}} recognize pedestrians at night. Ten young and 10 older participants drove around a closed road circuit and responded when they first recognized a pedestrian. Four pedestrian clothing and two beam conditions were tested. Results demonstrate that driver age, clothing configuration, <b>headlamp</b> <b>beam,</b> and glare all significantly affect performance. Drivers recognized only 5 % of pedestrians in the most challenging condition (low beams, black clothing, glare), whereas drivers recognized 100 % of the pedestrians who wore retroreflective clothing configured to depict biological motion (no glare). In the absence of glare, mean recognition distances varied from 0. 0 m (older drivers, low beam, black clothing) to 220 m (722 feet; younger drivers, high beam, retroreflective biomotion). These data provide new motivation to minimize interactions between vehicular and pedestrian traffic at night and suggest garment designs to maximize pedestrian conspicuity when these interactions are unavoidable...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 10) This {{study examined}} the effects of proportional increases in light output throughout the entire <b>headlamp</b> <b>beam</b> pattern on visibility. The baseline beam pattern was a median market-weighted U. S. tungsten-halogen low-beam pattern. Ten derived beam patterns were obtained by multiplying each point in the baseline beam pattern by a constant that ranged from 1. 1 to 2. 0, in increments of 0. 1. Finally, for comparison, we also used the median market-weighted U. S. high-beam pattern. Visibility changes were estimated by calculating the reach of a 3 -lux line 0. 25 m above the road surface, for both straight and curved roadways. The results indicate that substantial gains in visibility on straight roadways require an increase of about 50 % in the overall light output of low beams. On curves, obtaining a substantial gain in visibility in several lateral positions would require significantly greater increase in light output. These results provide an enhanced baseline against which to compare other potential improvements in low-beam visibility, including more localized changes in static beam patterns and adaptive headlighting systems...|$|E
40|$|Undoubtedly, the {{detection}} of peripheral objects and pedestrians while driving is an important visual task. However, there are few data that describe the impact of parameters such as headlamp illumination, peripheral angle and target reflectance upon the speed and accuracy with which one can detect peripheral targets. The present paper outlines a framework {{for the development of}} a model that predicts reaction times and detection percentages to small targets of varying reflectance, and located at various positions in the field of view. The preliminary model closely matches data from independently-performed field studies using halogen and high intensity discharge headlamp sets having illumination characteristics that conform to North American and European requirements for <b>headlamp</b> <b>beam</b> patterns. The modeling approach discussed in the paper allows characteristics such as the effective field of view to be described. Further, the approach could be extended to incorporate driver age, target size, visual clutter, spectral power distribution, glare and ambient roadway illumination into the model predictions. Such a model could serve as a useful complement to existing models of on-axis (foveal) visual performance in driving context...|$|E

We apply the presented approach to low-beam and high-beam patterns in different fog conditions, and we bring quantitative proof for the need to dip the headlamps in dense fog. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits of the presented approach for road operation as well as for automotive front-lighting and advanced driver aiding system design...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 14) This {{study examined}} the effect that hydrophobic treatment of glass headlamp lenses has on light output when headlamps are exposed to contaminants under naturalistic driving conditions. The hypothesis, a priori, was that the water-repelling nature of a glass surface after hydrophobic treatment would aid in minimizing the adhesion, or promote the removal, of contaminants on the lens, thereby leaving light output less affected. Additional variables of interest included the presence of precipitation, {{the side of the}} vehicle the headlamp was on, and whether the headlamp was illuminated during the exposure. The study examined vehicles with glass lenses installed as intended by the vehicle manufacturer. The vehicles were driven on a 155 -km route under conditions of active precipitation or no precipitation, and with or without the headlamps on. Subsequent to each drive, measurements of light output were made at eight key test points in the <b>headlamp</b> <b>beam</b> pattern. The headlamps were then cleaned and measured again. In this way, each headlamp served as its own control. The results indicate that hydrophobic treatment of glass headlamp lenses did not affect light output. However, the presence of precipitation did result in decreased light output below the horizontal cutoff of the beam pattern and increased light output above the horizontal cutoff. This result was especially evident above the horizontal cutoff when the headlamps had been illuminated. The side of the vehicle the headlamp was on did not affect light output...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} changes in <b>headlamp</b> <b>beam</b> patterns {{as a function}} of the level of haze in sheets of plastic materials that were inserted in front of either a U. S. or a European low-beam headlamp. The level of haze was measured according to the method required by the U. S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This method (ASTM Standard D 1003 - 92) measures the percentage of transmitted light that deviates from the incident beam through forward scatter by more than 2. 5 °. The actual effects on the beam pattern were then compared with predictions based on modeling the effects by assuming Gaussian distributions of the scattered light. The main finding is that the redictions for the four different plastic materials tested were neither uniformly accurate nor uniformly inaccurate. This lack of consistency is in agreement with the fact that the ASTM definition of haze does not uniquely specify the distribution of the scattered light. This problem with using the ASTM definition was confirmed by measuring the distributions of light scattering by two materials that had essentially the same ASTM index of haze. The implication of this research is that establishing a justifiable maximum haze level for headlamp lens materials would require using a definition of haze that uniquely defines the resultant distribution of the light scatter. Consequently, it is recommended that future research should evaluate the distribution of scattered light using actual materials for headlamp lenses after different lengths of weathering exposure...|$|E

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} daylight with 32 participants to determine whether left turning drivers’ gap acceptance in front of approaching motorcycles depends on the motorcycle’s forward lighting treatment. Five experimental lighting treatments including a modulated high <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp,</b> or the low <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> plus pairs of low-mounted auxiliary lamps, high-mounted auxiliary lamps, both high- and low-mounted auxiliary lamps, or low-mounted LED lamps were compared to a baseline treatment with only the low <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> illuminated. Participants viewed the approaching traffic stream (including the motorcycle) on an active roadway and indicated {{when it would be}} safe (and not safe) to initiate a left turn across the opposing lanes. Participants also shared their attention with a secondary visual distraction task that took their eyes off the forward roadway. Participants did not know {{that the purpose of the}} study was to measure their responses to approaching motorcycles. Based on participants’ indications of the last safe moment to turn, the mean temporal safety margin provided to the approaching motorcycle did not differ significantly between any of the experimental lighting treatments and the baseline treatment. However, having either low-mounted auxiliary lamps or modulated high beam lamps on the motorcycle significantly reduced the probability of obtaining a potentially unsafe short safety margin as compared to the baseline lighting treatment. Overall, the results suggest that enhancing the frontal conspicuity of motorcycles with lighting treatments beyond an illuminated low <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> may be an effective countermeasure for daytime crashes involving right-of-way violations...|$|R

40|$|Incorporating {{safety in}} the design of a highway is one of the {{foremost}} duties of a design engineer. Design guidelines provide standards that help engineers include {{safety in the}} design of various geometric features. However, design guidelines are not frequently revised and do not accommodate for the frequent changes in vehicle design. One such example is the change in vehicle headlamps. These changes significantly impact the illuminance provided on the road and in turn the design formula. Roadway visibility is critical for nighttime driving. In the absence of roadway lighting, vehicle headlamps illuminate the road ahead of a vehicle. Sag vertical curve design depends on the available headlight sight distance provided by the 1 degree upward diverging <b>headlamp</b> <b>beam.</b> The sag curve design formulas were developed in the early 1940 s when sealed beam headlamps were predominant. However, headlamps have changed significantly and modern headlamps project less light above the horizontal axis. In this research, the difference in illuminance provided by sealed beam headlamps and modern headlamps was examined. For the theoretical analysis, three different sag curves were analyzed. On these curves, about 26 percent reduction in illuminance was observed at a distance equal to the stopping sight distance when comparing sealed beam to modern headlamps. A change in the headlamp divergence angle from 1. 0 degree to 0. 85 degree will provide the required illuminance on the road when using modern headlamps. A field study was performed to validate the theoretical calculations. It was observed that for modern headlamps, a divergence angle less than 1 degree and greater than 0. 5 degrees will provide illuminance values comparable to sealed beam headlamps. As a part of this research, a preliminary study, examining the impact of degraded headlamp lenses on the illuminance provided on sag vertical curves was conducted. A significant reduction in illuminance reaching the roadway on sag curves was observed, due to headlamp lens degradation...|$|E
40|$|Road {{accidents}} {{at night}} are disproportionately high in numbers and severity compared to day, {{and the major}} factor contributing to this problem is darkness because of its great influence on the driver's behaviour and ability. To provide visibility to the driver in unlit areas, vehicles are equipped with headlamps which illuminate the road ahead. But {{in the presence of}} oncoming traffic, using low beam is compulsory to minimize headlight glare. Hence, designing headlamps which maximize roadway visibility for the driver and minimize the nuisance to other road users at the same time is a challenge. There are at least two different approaches to evaluate the performance of front-lighting systems. Those who design and manufacture headlamps use standard criteria which are directly related to the <b>headlamp</b> <b>beam</b> pattern. Some of these criteria are related to safety, such as the 3 -lux line, and others are related to comfort, such as the beam spread. Those who use the headlamps (or their representatives) prefer criteria which are directly based on visibility range. They tend to focus on specific targets which are critical in terms of safety, namely pedestrians, pavement markings and signs. Implementing the latter, driver-oriented approach involves conventional traffic scenarios, which actually form the basis of the standard criteria of the former, vehicle-oriented approach. Visibility Level (VL) is the index which is most often used to assess the performance of lighting systems in a driver-oriented approach, not only for vehicle lighting systems, but for road lighting systems as well. VL is the ratio between the actual contrast of a target and the threshold contrast which is needed to detect to target. The threshold is usually computed by means of an empirical vision model based on laboratory data, and the operational viewing conditions are accounted for by means of a field factor based on road tests. In this paper we focus on the impact of the road environment on the VL-based performance of a lighting system. After reviewing the VL-based approaches to evaluate lighting systems, we present a night-time visibility meter based on measured pavement reflection properties, developed for road operators to evaluate the quality of service of their network in terms of the visibility offered to the drivers. We discuss how the data from this system could feed advanced front-lighting systems or infrastructure-vehicle cooperative systems to improve road safety at night...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{expectancy}} on {{the perceptions}} of drivers is an important variable that affects highway safety. But, it is not well understood. An experiment in which the visibility of a pedestrian dummy was measured found that the visibility distance was twice as great when drivers expected the pedestrian than when it was unexpected. The results of that study {{have been used as}} though the 2 : 1 ratio in visibility could be extrapolated to other night driving conditions. Arguments against such generalization are made. They involve analyses of the illumination of <b>headlamp</b> <b>beams,</b> the probability of detection of objects and the effects of speed. Various theoretical approaches are used to evaluate the role of expectancy and other studies are reviewed. No support was found for the 2 : 1 constant ratio between “expected ” and “unexpected ” driver visibility in night driving. Further work is needed to study expectancy and to quantify its effect on visibility in a variety of situations. Expectancy plays a role in affecting human behavior in at least two ways. Firstly, it affects our predictions about the environment and the kinds of responses we may have to make and, secondly, it affect...|$|R
