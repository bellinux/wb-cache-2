Stuart was educated at the Edinburgh Academy and {{attended}} the University of Edinburgh, but did not graduate. On leaving school Stuart worked in merchant's office at Leith and at Glasgow. Then Stuart worked as manager of the North of <b>Ireland</b> <b>Linen</b> Mills. In 1845 Stuart worked for the mercantile and banking house Carr Tagore & Co. in Calcutta, India. Finding that the climate did not suit him, Stuart went to New Zealand in 1850.|$|E
50|$|Irish linen (Línéadach Éireannach) is {{the brand}} name given to linen {{produced}} in <b>Ireland.</b> <b>Linen</b> is cloth woven from, or yarn spun from the flax fibre, which was grown in Ireland for many years before advanced agricultural methods and more suitable climate led to the concentration of quality flax cultivation in northern Europe (Most of the world crop of quality flax is now grown in Northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands). Since about the 1950s to 1960s the flax fibre for Irish Linen yarn has been, almost exclusively, imported from France, Belgium and the Netherlands. It is bought by spinners who produce yarn and this, in turn, is sold to weavers (or knitters) who produce fabric. Irish linen spinning has now virtually ceased, yarns being imported from places such as the Eastern part of the Europe Union and China. The best of these yarns are still spun, on the whole, from Northern European flax.|$|E
50|$|Lisburn is {{also known}} as the birthplace of <b>Ireland's</b> <b>linen</b> industry, which was {{established}} in 1698 by Louis Crommelin and other Huguenots. An exhibition about the Irish linen industry is now housed in the Irish Linen Centre, which {{can be found in the}} old Market House in Market Square.|$|R

The Sintons, {{like so many of}} Northern <b>Ireland's</b> <b>linen</b> {{families}} were Quakers, in this case of Scottish descent; although the Sintons had been settled at Tamnaghmore for several hundred years. Thomas Sinton was sent to board at Friends' School, Lisburn - a Quaker school. In 1859 he married Elizabeth Bridget Hesilridge Buckby (1835-1900), her family lived at Prospect House, Tandragee. He had eight children by his wife; ...|$|R
50|$|With {{government}} support, McCarthy traveled throughout Ireland, {{talking to}} various Protestant communities, including the Ulster Scots Agency, the Public Records Office of Northern <b>Ireland,</b> the <b>Linen</b> Hall Library, and the Monreagh Heritage Centre. It was also supported {{in the media}} by Ian Adamson, OBE, and William Humphrey DUP MLA in the Belfast Telegraph.|$|R

50|$|Heavy {{industry}} {{is concentrated in}} and around Belfast, although other major towns and cities also have heavy manufacturing areas. Machinery and equipment manufacturing, food processing, textile and electronics manufacturing are the leading industries. Other industries such as papermaking, furniture manufacturing, aerospace and shipbuilding are also important, concentrated mostly in the eastern parts of Northern Ireland. Of these different industries, {{one of the most}} notable is that of Northern <b>Ireland's</b> fine <b>linens,</b> which is considered {{as one of the most}} well-known around Europe.|$|R
50|$|The Linen Green {{is built}} {{on the site of}} a former linen mill. It was {{established}} in 1993 by Moygashel Community Development Association as the first factory outlet village in <b>Ireland.</b> The Moygashel <b>Linen</b> Visitors' Centre is also based there. The complex offers clothing, food, giftware and a physiotherapist.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{long history}} of the {{production}} of <b>linen</b> in <b>Ireland.</b> The Living <b>Linen</b> Project was set up in 1995 as an oral archive of the knowledge of the Irish linen industry, which was at that time still available within a nucleus of people who formerly worked in the industry in Ulster.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1928, the Irish Linen Guild is {{a promotional}} {{organization}} of the Irish Linen industry. The Guild's main role is to promote Irish linen in national and international markets, through its website. The guild's brand's trademark {{is the focus of}} all promotional activities. This mark is often colloquially referred to as the, 'carpet beater symbol'. It can only be used to mark genuine Irish linen products such as linen yarn spun in <b>Ireland</b> and <b>linen</b> fabrics woven in Ireland by members of the Guild. Products made from genuine Irish linen fabric, such as garments or table linens can be labelled Irish linen although the made up item may have been assembled elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in St. Marys, Ontario, the son of Sidney Fraleigh, and was educated there. In 1902, he married Winnifred Anderson. He belonged to the local Masonic lodge. Fraleigh grew flax and hemp near Forest, Ontario. Fraleigh also pioneered {{techniques}} to make more efficient use of pasture land when raising of livestock. Fraleigh coordinated Canadian flax production in World War I: flax was shipped to <b>Ireland</b> to produce <b>linen</b> {{for use in the}} manufacture of airplane wings. Fraleigh also experimented with the production of hemp for use in manufacturing fibres. The cultivation of hemp was later banned in Canada because of its association with cannabis. He died at his home in Forest, Ontario, on January 29, 1946.|$|R
50|$|The Irish Linen Guild {{has defined}} Irish linen as yarn which is spun in Ireland from 100% flax fibres. Irish linen fabric {{is defined as}} fabric which is woven in <b>Ireland</b> from 100% <b>linen</b> yarns. It is not {{required}} that every stage from the growing of the flax to the weaving must take place in Ireland. To be Irish linen fabric the yarns do not necessarily {{have to come from}} an Irish spinner, and to be Irish linen (yarn) the flax fibre {{does not have to be}} grown in Ireland. However, the skills, craftsmanship, and technology that go into spinning the yarn must be Irish, as is the case with Irish linen fabric; where the design and weaving skills must be Irish, and all of such must take place in Ireland.|$|R
25|$|For {{the second}} season, {{the city of}} Dubrovnik, Croatia, was used instead of Malta for scenes in King's Landing and Daenerys' scenes in Qarth. For example, the Minčeta Tower in Dubrovnik {{was used as the}} House of the Undying. Scenes set north of the Wall were filmed in Iceland in November 2011. The main {{locations}} are the Vatnajökull glacier, the Svínafellsjökull glacier near Skaftafell, and the Mýrdalsjökull glacier near Vik used as the location for the Fist of the First Men with Höfðabrekka as the Frostfang Mountains. New shooting locations in Northern <b>Ireland</b> include The <b>Linen</b> Mill Film & Television Studios in Banbridge, Ballintoy Harbour and Downhill Strand. As the story in the second season required that the Winterfell set be expanded, a new set for Winterfell was built at the Moneyglass Estate near Toome village.|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{much of his}} {{writings}} tom Jones Hughes has returned {{again and again to}} the theme of Irish regionalism. Notwithstanding his acknowledgement of the role of cultural, and indeed ethnic, factors in the identification of patterns, he has most frequently employed economic variables in a search for regional indicators. His classic cartographic portrayal of the extend of eighteenth and nineteenth century landlord improvements was based on a detailed interpretation of the Griffith Valuation, and analyses of agricultural statistics provided him with the configuration of major regions of economic specialisation in post-Famine rural Ireland. Even his more recent writings have placed considerable emphasis upon economic data, as witness his mapping of farms with a valuation of one hundred pounds or more. While the ultimate goal of all this analysis has been to identify and measure the nature, scale and intensity of spatial differentiation within this island, and while he would probably recoil from being labelled an economic geographer, it is nonetheless apparent that Tom Jones Hughes’s writings suggest a strong interest in regional economies, their landscapes and their socio-cultural manifestations. This essay seeks to identify the agricultural background of probably the most distinctive regional economy to have matured in nineteenth century <b>Ireland,</b> the <b>linen</b> industry of the northern half of the country. Specifically, this essay will explore the regional dimension of flax cultivation and its immediate proto-industrial offshoot, scutch milling. The secondary stages of textile production – the spinning, weaving and bleaching processes – do not form part of the present study...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{have been}} giving Irish trading {{networks}} more attention recently (see, for example, Louis M. Cullen. The Irish Brandy Houses of Eighteenth-Century France. Dublin: The Lilliput Press, 2001). Thomas M. Truxes has already written a pioneer {{book on the}} subject (Irish-American Trade, 1660 1783. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989). Ireland could trade directly with British America since a modification in English navigation laws in 1731. In his new book, Truxes gives us an in-depth view of the most successful Irish-American partnership of the time based on the letters sent by its New York partner during nine months in 1756 and 1757. These were interesting times: the Seven Year s War had opened new opportunities including (British) privateering and troop supply and caused new difficulties such as the renewed fight against smuggling by the English authorities and (French) privateering without disrupting fundamentally the traditional flows of trade between Ireland and British America. <b>Ireland</b> mainly exported <b>linens,</b> salted beef, pork, butter, and passengers and imported flax seeds, rum, lumber, staves, and some pig iron and semi-manufactured goods. ...|$|R
