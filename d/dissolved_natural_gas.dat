These estimates are based on different assumptions concerning {{the thickness of the}} formations, their areal extent, {{and the degree to which}} the formation is saturated with methane. These numbers are significant and several times bigger than conventional natural gas resources. However, the recovery factor was estimated to be less than 3 % (Wallace et al. 1979).

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this paper {{is a continuation of}} experiments begun and carried out by B. H. Sage, and described in his thesis for the Masters degree C. I. T. 1931. The object of the research was to determine as quantitatively as possible the solubility of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in various crude oils, as it was known that by <b>dissolving</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in crude oil, the physical properties of the oil could be changed {{in such a way as}} to make possible greater recovery of the crude oil from the underground formation. As pointed out by Mr. Sage, the solubility figures presented in his thesis had to be arrived at by a method of approximation as he was then not experimentally able to measure the change in liquid volume resulting from dissolved gas. In order to make possible more accurate calculation of gas solubility, apparatus was designed and installed for directly measuring the change in volume of the crude oil which occurred as a result of dissolved gas. Other changes were made in the equipment as first set up by Mr. Sage, which were designed to increase accuracy and speed in carrying out the experiments. These changes will be discussed in the main body of this report. ...|$|R
40|$|While {{exploring}} ways {{of producing}} better fuels for propulsion of a spacecraft on the Mars sample return mission, {{a researcher at}} Johnson Space Center (JSC) devised a way of blending fuel by combining methane or <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> with a second fuel to produce a fuel that can be maintained in liquid form at ambient temperature and under moderate pressure. The use of such a blended fuel would be a departure for both spacecraft engines and terrestrial internal combustion engines. For spacecraft, it would enable reduction of weights on long flights. For the automotive industry on Earth, such a fuel could be easily distributed and could be a less expensive, more efficient, and cleaner-burning alternative to conventional fossil fuels. The concept of blending fuels is not new: for example, the production of gasoline includes the addition of liquid octane enhancers. For the future, it has been commonly suggested to substitute methane or compressed <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> for octane-enhanced gasoline as a fuel for internal-combustion engines. Unfortunately, methane or <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> must be stored either as a compressed gas (if kept at ambient temperature) or as a cryogenic liquid. The ranges of automobiles would be reduced from their present values because of limitations on the capacities for storage of these fuels. Moreover, technical challenges are posed {{by the need to}} develop equipment to handle these fuels and, especially, to fill tanks acceptably rapidly. The JSC alternative to provide a blended fuel that can be maintained in liquid form at moderate pressure at ambient temperature has not been previously tried. A blended automotive fuel according to this approach would be made by <b>dissolving</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in gasoline. The autogenous pressure of this fuel would eliminate the need for a vehicle fuel pump, but a pressure and/or flow regulator would be needed to moderate the effects of temperature and to respond to changing engine power demands. Because the fuel would flash as it entered engine cylinders, relative to gasoline, it would disperse more readily and therefore would mix with air more nearly completely. As a consequence, this fuel would burn more nearly completely (and, hence, more cleanly) than gasoline does. The storage density of this fuel would be similar to that of gasoline, but its energy density would be such that the mileage (more precisely, the distance traveled per unit volume of fuel) would be greater than that of either gasoline or compressed <b>natural</b> <b>gas.</b> Because the pressure needed to maintain the fuel in liquid form would be more nearly constant and generally lower than that needed to maintain compressed <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in liquid form, the pressure rating of a tank used to hold this fuel could be lower than that of a tank used to hold compressed <b>natural</b> <b>gas.</b> A mixture of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> and gasoline could be distributed more easily than could some alternative fuels. A massive investment in new equipment would not be necessary: One could utilize the present fuel-distribution infrastructure and could blend the gasoline and <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> at almost any place in the production or distribution process - perhaps even at the retail fuel pump. Yet another advantage afforded by use of a blend of gasoline and <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> would be a reduction in the amount of gasoline consumed. Because <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> costs less than gasoline does and is in abundant supply in the United States, the cost of automotive fuel and the demand for imported oil could be reduced...|$|R

The main objective of the research reported here was to determine the volume of gas dissolved in the geopressured water, as well as the qualitative and quantitative composition of the water and the dissolved gas.
