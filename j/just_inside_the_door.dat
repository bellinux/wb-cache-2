25|$|The Lords Chamber is {{the site}} of nationally {{televised}} ceremonies, the most important of which is the State Opening of Parliament, which is held formally to open each annual parliamentary session, either after a General Election or in the autumn. At this occasion every constitutional element of the government is represented: the Crown (both literally, and figuratively in the person of the Sovereign), The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and The Commons, (who together form the Legislature), the Judiciary (although no judges are members of either House of Parliament), and the Executive (both Government Ministers, and ceremonial military units in attendance on the Sovereign); and a large number of guests are invited to attend in the large Royal Gallery immediately outside the Chamber. The Sovereign, seated on the Throne, delivers the Speech from the Throne, outlining the Government's programme for the year and legislative agenda for the forthcoming parliamentary session. The Commons may not enter the Lords' debating floor; instead, they watch the proceedings from beyond the Bar of the House, <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> A small purely formal ceremony is held to end each parliamentary session, when the Sovereign is merely represented by a group of Lords Commissioners.|$|E
25|$|St Paul's Anglican Cathedral, {{built in}} 1894 {{and the oldest}} church {{building}} in the city still in use, is a modest parish church {{on the periphery of}} the central business district whose parish dates from 1883. It has been the designated cathedral church of the Anglican Diocese of Qu'Appelle, comprising most of Southern Saskatchewan, since 1944 when it supplanted the original pro-cathedral of St Peter's in the eponymous town of Qu'Appelle. It was then assumed that St. Paul's would remain pro-cathedral temporarily and that plans would be fulfilled to build a substantial cathedral at the corner of College Avenue and Broad Street: the site remains obvious, with hedges planted about the planned building, its liturgical west end at the corner of the intersection. However, by 1974 the diocese reached the conclusion that this outcome was improbable, and St. Paul's Pro-Cathedral was designated Cathedral. Indeed, its organ console being on the liturgical and geographical south end of the choir, <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> into the chapel and the pipes on the north side, the choir was moved to the north transept with a new Casavant Frères organ, its two-manual console there and the pipes overhead. (The location of the organ console and the choir have changed a third time, now being in the north transept.) Its future cathedral status, however, is somewhat in doubt as the Anglican Church of Canada considers rationalising its increasingly top-heavy episcopal structure and, with decreasing numbers of active church people it being over equipped with that, with parish churches steadily decreasing in number.|$|E
2500|$|The view in {{the mirror}} shows two figures <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> that the couple are facing. The second figure, wearing red, is presumably the artist although, unlike Velázquez in Las Meninas, he {{does not seem to}} be painting. Scholars have made this {{assumption}} based on the appearance of figures wearing red head-dresses in some other van Eyck works (e.g., the Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?) and the figure in the background of the Madonna with Chancellor Rolin). [...] The dog is an early form of the breed now known as the Brussels griffon.|$|E

5000|$|Located {{on three}} floors of two {{existing}} Beaux's Arts-style office buildings, the Board of Education’s proposed {{plan for the}} loft was a set of standard plans {{for a series of}} classrooms off a corridor. Willis devised a locus plan− “a cluster of classrooms for each grade around an interior quad space, where teachers have a selection of a variety of spaces to fit a personalized approach to their students’ needs.” At the Manhattan Village Academy, “the educational philosophy is embedded in the architecture.” In addition to the reconfiguration of the classroom layout, Willis rejected the original plan’s main entrance at the rear, adjacent to the freight exit. Instead, Willis designed “a grand high school faced in miniature; <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> four Greek-temple steps, done in marble, ascend to an aluminum spiral staircase, leading to the school’s second floor lobby.” ...|$|R
