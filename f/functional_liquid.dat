40|$|A novel {{technique}} for formation of metal lines for electronic devices, and for reduction of resistivity in such metal lines, is proposed. In the technique, the metal lines are formed in trenches by using functional liquids containing metal nanoparticles. The trenches are constructed on a plastic substrate by imprint of a patterned mold. When the whole {{surface of the}} plastic substrate {{is covered with a}} hydrophobic film, the hydrophobic property disappears only in the trenches due to the pressing process of the imprint, and thus the <b>functional</b> <b>liquid</b> automatically accumulates into the trenches. When the metallic <b>functional</b> <b>liquid</b> is modified with tween- 20 (polyoxyethylene- 20), metal lines with a width of 10  μm are formed by capillary effect. The resistivity of such metal lines can be lowered to the order of 10 ^  Ω[*]cm by exposing them to hydrogen atoms generated in vacuum by catalytic cracking of hydrogen molecules with heated tungsten wires...|$|E
40|$|Printing {{electronic}} components on plastic foils with <b>functional</b> <b>liquid</b> inks {{is an attractive}} approach for achieving flexible and low-cost circuitry for applications such as bendable displays and large-area sensors. The challenges for printed electronics, however, include characteristically slow switching frequencies and associated high supply voltages, which together impede widespread application. Combining printable high-capacitance dielectrics with printable high-mobility semiconductors could potentially solve these problems. Here we demonstrate fast, flexible digital circuits based on semiconducting carbon nanotube (CNT) networks and high-capacitance ion gel gate dielectrics, which were patterned by jet printing of liquid inks. Ion gel-gated CNT thin-film transistors (TFTs) with 50 μm channel lengths display ambipolar transport with electron and hole mobilities > 20 cm 2 /V·s; these devices {{form the basis of}} printed inverters, NAND gates, and ring oscillators on both polyimide and SiO 2 substrates.

40|$|This work is {{dedicated}} to the improvement of materials properties of thermoset resins by the use of tailor-made additives. Inorganic nanofillers derived from layered silicates as well as <b>functional</b> <b>liquid</b> polymers of various architectures were used alone or in combination to tailor different properties, such as thermal stability, toughness or stiffness. Emphasis was also laid on easy processability of the resin systems. Significant progress was made when organophilic layered silicates were added together with modified liquid poly(propylene oxide) starpolymers to epoxy resins. The resulting epoxy hybrid nanocomposites afforded improved toughness showing no reduction in stiffness and glass temperature. An optimized hybrid system was employed in a resin transfer moulding process to prepare carbon fibre reinforced composites containing silicate nanoparticles. Fibre impregnation was however accompanied by filtration of the organophilic silicate particles. Hyperbranched blockcopolyethers with nanometer size and core/shell type topology were prepared as a new class of liquid rubbers. Subsequent modification yielded hydroxy, phenol and glycidyl end groups. A high compatibility with the matrix resin accounted for the formation of single phase epoxy blends without enhancing toughness. Hyperbranched blockcopolyethers containing oligo(allyl glycidyl ether) blocks, on the other hand, proved to be very effective toughening agents for vinyl ester urethane hybrid resins.

40|$|The {{simplicity}} of the ink jet process has led to major changes in electronics packaging in {{what is known as}} printed elec-tronics. Major changes here means drastic cost reduction relative to the long-term trend, and also creating a new per-formance axis (flexibility, customization, large area, little environmental load … namely added value). However, simplicity has two sides: ‘Possibility ’ and ‘Limitation. ’ For the past several years, ‘Possibility ’ has been attracting a lot of attention, but in the coming years, if ink jet technology does not overcome ‘Limitation’, the real change will never occur. In this paper, the related issues and status of approaches resolved by ink jet printheads or the printing process are described for the further progress and practical application of printed electronics using ink jet technologies. These issues can be categorized into 1) ejecting processes of <b>functional</b> <b>liquid,</b> 2) drop landing and dot (film) formation on the substrate, and 3) maintaining printhead reliability. In particular, expanding the range of applicable liquids, further miniaturization of the ejected liquid drop, and improved accuracy of dot positioning are strongly required for printheads. In printed electronics, unlike with desktop ink jet printers, impermeable media are often used, so analysis and control of the behavior of the liquid on the substrate are also important. Furthermore, technologies for maintaining stability in the ejected drops make a difference. These novel activities for improving ink jet issues will face tough problems and need revolutionary approaches, but a great innovation in printed electronics using ink jet technologies can be expected when success is achieved...|$|E
40|$|The UV-protection {{provided}} to addition type silicone elastomers by various colorants, such as conventional dry earth pigments, {{as well as}} the so called ""functional or reactive"" pigments, was investigated. Moreover, the effect of a UV light absorber and a silica filler was also explored. Under the experimental parameters of this work, the exposure of silicone to UV radiation resulted in some changes of the IR absorbance, thermal decomposition after 400 °C, Tg and tensile properties, whereas the storage modulus of samples was not affected. The obtained spectroscopic data, {{as well as the}} results of TGA and storage modulus, were interpreted by assuming that chain scission takes place during aging, whereas the improvement of tensile strength allows the hypothesis of a post-curing process, initiated by UV radiation. Therefore, the increase of Tg could partly be due to the above reason and, furthermore, to the contribution of a rearrangement of chain fragments within the free volume of the elastomeric material. Regarding the evaluation of various coloring agents used in this work, the obtained results show that dry pigments are more sensitive to accelerated ageing conditions in comparison with <b>functional</b> <b>liquid</b> pigments. Moreover, the hydrophobic character of silicone matrix is enhanced, with the addition of this type pigments because of the vinyl functional silanes groups present in their chemical structure. Finally, {{it should be noted that}} the incorporation of silica nanofiller did not seem to prevent the silicone elastomer from degradation upon UV irradiation, but showed a significant reinforcing effect. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010...|$|E

The synthesis of these liquids will be described. The resulting methyltrialkylonium ionic liquids can be easily and irreversibly anion exchanged thereby allowing to tune properties such as melting point, solubility, acid–base properties, stability, and viscosity, yielding a plethora of different ionic liquids with only CO 2 and methanol as by-products.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the capillary modeling science of nematic liquid crystals and its applications to the stability, structure, and shape of films, membranes, fibers, and drops. Liquid crystals are anisotropic viscoelastic materials possessing long range orientational order, and hence these models are relevant to the capillary science of anisotropic soft matter. A systematic multiscale approach is used to derive the equations that govern the shape of interfaces and contact lines. These shape equations generalize the surface Laplace and the contact line Neuman equations by introducing long range orientational order, gradient elasticity, surfactant adsorbants, magnetic and electric fields. The thermodynamics of capillary systems is used to reveal novel cross-effects such as adsorption-driven shape changes of surfaces and contact lines. The capillary models are used to analyze the structure and stability of films, membranes, fibers, and drops, of direct relevance to the processing and performance of structural and <b>functional</b> <b>liquid</b> crystals. Novel soft materials and mechanisms analyzed in this paper include: (1) stabilization of freely-suspended nematic films by orientation and molecular order heterogeneities, (2) orientational defects in polymer dispersed liquid crystals films, shown to originate from surface anchoring transitions, (3) electric field-induced curvature in membranes for sensor and actuator applications, (4) new helical morphologies of thin nematic filaments driven by strong interfacial anchoring, (5) tunable partial wetting through contact angle modification via gradient and anchoring elasticity, (6) liquid crystal nanoemulsion shape control through anchoring effects, and (7) magnetic shaping in liquid crystal colloids. Readily accessible applications to biological liquid crystal materials and processes indicate that capillary modeling science will be a most active area of research in the very near future. ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{production}} of greenhouse vegetables, {{the decline of the}} wholesale price of tomato and cucumber has impaired the profitability of greenhouse enterprises. New species are sought for production to improve the profitability. In Finland only one quarter of {{the production}} of sweet pepper is domestic and the proportion of organic production is small. There is a remarkable market for domestic sweet pepper. However, the shortage of nutrients and water as well as the tolerance of stress are limiting the yield of sweet pepper. In the organic greenhouse production commercial liquid fertilizers are used to insure the availability of nutrients during the formation of the yield. They are significantly more expensive than chemical fertilizers. The cost of supplemental liquid fertilizer could be reduced by developing a fertilizer based on animal urine. Urine is commonly available for free on farms. On the other hand, the sales of urine could when proven a <b>functional</b> <b>liquid</b> fertilizer, in principle make a significant source of income of the same order of the income from milk, when the price of urine would be derived from the price of the nutrients in the organic liquid fertilizers. Some entrepreneurs have already tried to use urine as a liquid fertilizer with great success. In the greenhouse production the availability of nutrients, the uptake of water, the growth of plants, flowering and the tolerance of stress could be improved by mycorrhizal inoculation. Actually, almost all the plants cultivated in the greenhouse; vegetables, spices and berries (except cabbages e. g. rucola) benefit from mycorrhiza when the conditions for the function of these fungi are optimal. Because mycorrhiza supplies the plants especially with phosphorus there is not much use of mycorrhiza when the phosphorus content of the media is high. Mycorrhiza works best when the solubility of phosphorus in the media is low. On the contrary, a high nitrogen content does not impair the function of mycorrhiza. From the Finnish soil, effective mycorrhiza strains have been isolated but these are not yet developed to commercial preparations. However, there have been positive experience of their advantages e. g. in spices, strawberry and flowers. The aim of this part of study is to develop an animal originating affordable ecological liquid fertilizer for production of organic sweet pepper in greenhouses and clarify the feasibility of mycorrhiza inoculation in {{the production of}} spices and vegetables on different medias. Materials and methods MTT Agricultural Engineering develops in co-operation with the University of Helsinki an animal urine originated liquid fertilizer suitable for organic greenhouse production. There is in {{the first phase of the}} research a test in a greenhouse lasting whole the production period (approx. 6 months) where 1) bovine urine as a supplemental fertilizer, 2) pig urine as a supplemental fertilizer, 3) a commercial organic liquid fertilizer by Biolan as a supplemental fertilizer, 4) media fertilized with chicken manure (natural fertilizer by Biolan) and 5) media fertilized with chicken manure (natural fertilizer by Biolan) with a commercial organic liquid fertilizer by Biolan as a supplemental fertilizer are tested. In the same greenhouse but in a separate test the effect of sea algal on the production of sweet pepper is studied. The treatments of the second phase are selected according to the results of the first phase. MTT Agricultural Engineering is responsible for planning the use of liquid fertilizer and installations of the instruments needed and participates in the reporting. The University of Helsinki is responsible for management of the test in co-operation with the enterprises. MTT Laukaa Research and Elite Plant Station clarifies in co-operation with the University of Helsinki the effects of mycorrhiza inoculation on the growth and yield production of selected organic spices and lettuce.
