40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop practical care procedures to help maintain the protective quality of <b>flame</b> <b>resistant</b> workwear laundered by workers in the field.

The first experiment involved two <b>flame</b> <b>resistant</b> (FR) fabrics, contaminated or not contaminated with oil. Independent variables also included detergent type and laundry pre-treatment. Other laundry parameters were controlled. Results indicated that it is easier to maintain the FR performance of the FR-treated blend than it is for the aramid fabric. It is hypothesized that energy generated by initial ignition of oil on the specimens triggers the FR mechanism of the treatment, which in turn inhibits further combustion. A second experiment using larger specimens and a domestic washing machine also supported the hypothesized mechanism. protective clothing decontamination flammability 1...|$|R
